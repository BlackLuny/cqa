IYGeagvEaa	Conosco quel documentario ma presenta una visione un po' distorta del nostro paese.    Prima di tutto il documentario sar anche americano ma si basa quasi interamente solo su dichiarazioni di giornalisti o politici italiani quindi alla fine  fatto da italiani. Perch i giornalisti italiani non si limitano ad esprimere opinioni ma spiegano anche i fatti. Il documentario dovrebbe invece spiegare come si svolgono i fatti e avere quindi la versione americana dei fatti nostrani. A questi bisogna poi aggiungere l'opinione di chi in Italia ci vive. Alla fine il documentario  americano per modo di dire.    Veniamo alle inesattezze.    Sartori afferma che Berlusconi controlla televisioni, case editrici, banche e assicurazioni. Per le prime due la cosa  vera ma le altre due proprio no. Controlla a met una piccola banca e assicurazione (Mediolanum).  La presunta cacciata di Berlusconi del direttore del Corriere della sera non  dimostrata ma sono solo illazioni. A dimostrazione che ci non  avvenuta pochi mesi dopo(ma sempre durante il governo Berlusconi) il direttore cambia nuovamente. Per la prima volta nella sua storia, non era mai successo al corriere sempre imparziale, si schiera come nella tradizione americana. Solo che si schiera con Prodi.  Ferruccio de Bortoli, il presunto direttore cacciato perch non filogovernativo  andato poco dopo in un altro importante giornale Il sole 24 ore.  Per quanto riguarda la RAI controllata da Berlusconi si rimarca ampiamente con interviste da parte dei giornalisti le sue pressione. Si dice, ma di passaggio, che ci  avvenuto sistematicamente da sempre con tutti i partiti che si sono succeduti al governo.  Ma la cosa pi assurda  quando dice "mentre riprendevamo questa piccola manifestazione i nostri operatori hanno dovuto affrontare un agente in borghese, che ci ha ricordato che qualsiasi immagine che danneggi il premier non  gradita". Io di immagini che danneggiano il premier e di manifestazioni contro ne ho viste parecchie sulla RAI e Mediaset. Vi ricordate i girotondi? Dimmi te se non  un'alterazione della verit questa.  Si afferma che Berlusconi ha affossato la RAI e la cosa  evidente guardando gli ascolti. Peccato che proprio l'anno di quel sondaggio .  Per far capire la partigianeria delle reti berlusconiane si fanno due esempi. Il primo quello di Fede dicendo che in una rete un presentatore ha saltato letteralmente di gioia quando  stato eletto. Il secondo esempio riguardava una parodia in cui il suo avversario era al mercato del pesce e insegnava come cucinarlo. Non so a che programma si riferisca per non mi sembra una cosa cos strana. Anche Berlusconi  stato parodiato parecchie volte. Nel caso di Fede gli americani non sanno che  una macchietta e che il suo tg ha un audience molto basso.    Se io non conoscessi l'Italia questo documentario ci presenta veramente uno scenario inquietante, fortunatamente non corrisponde alla verit.|`|8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	Non sar sicuramente un documentario che far cambiare idea ai fans di Berlusconi, anche perch tutte quelle cose i Forzisti le sanno gi e davanti al Capo passano comunque in secondo piano, l'importante per loro  battere i comunisti e tornare al governo.|`|2c8fSx4saa	Ma io mi chiedo una cosa    Berlusconi con tutti i soldi che ha, perch vuole a tutti i costi governare il paese????

eia6FK0Xaa	C'est la rflexion que je me suis faite ce matin.  Que les enfants honorent des enfants morts  cause de la btise humaine, de l'injustice ou autre, d'accord.  Il est important qu'ils prennent conscience des souffrances qu'ont vcu et vivent encore certains enfants de leur age.  Mais pourquoi seulement ceux victimes de la Shoah ?   Et pendant cette guerre, il y a eu des enfants de tziganes, les enfants br?ls vifs dans l'glise d'Ouradour ...etc.    Mais apprendre aux enfants que le racisme, sous toutes ses formes conduit  des atrocits, permettrait peut tre d'viter que  des jeunes se tournent vers divers extrmistes, ne s'entretuent parce qu'ils n'ont pas la mme couleur de peau, les mmes ides, les mmes penchants, qu'ils ne sont pas du mme quartier.   Quand certains disent ils sont trop jeunes, attention, ce n'est pas quand il sera trop tard, qu'il faudra leur apprendre  respecter les autres.  10 ans, ce ne sont plus des bbs.  Ils sont jeunes  10,11ans, mais il y a des fa?ons adaptes de leurs faire prendre conscience que toute vie est respectable et  protger, sans les traumatiser. D'autant qu'avec les jeux vidos, la tl, les films, ils voient les choses sans recul... Alors en parler avec eux, n'est pas forcment mauvais.  Il ne faut pas tout oublier non plus, sans repentance excessive, mais sans tout vouloir effacer.  Ce qui me gne, c'est qu'il s'agit ici d'une seule catgorie de victimes, elles sont certes respectables et leur extermination fut atroce, mais elle ne doit pas faire oublier, les autres victimes, les anciennes, comme celles qui existent encore partout dans le monde.|`|27AGUgQlaa	c'est pas nouveau Yves la France traite les sujets  la tte du client...|`|PtnBnnmdaa	c'est pour remonter sa cote de popularit...|`|BN3KurvFaa	pitoyable!|`|A45Wbu4Daa	Pour rpondre a ta question, il n'y a pas de refus de repentence mais refus d'accepter de nouveaux boulet.Concernant les massacres des indignes par les fran?ais?

6ce3b1a8cfbd4eb4b4f5e78161a24f8eaa	860 millions dhommes et de femmes sont, dans le monde, confronts  lincapacit de lire et dcrire, privs des plus simples comptences de base. Les pays industrialiss, o la scolarit est obligatoire, ne sont pas pargns.    Pour qualifier cette situation, qui touche tous les ages de la vie, et la distinguer de celle de personnes qui ne sont jamais alls  lcole, la France a choisi le terme dillettrisme. Un mot dur, qui suscite la raction, lindignation, mais qui est encore aujourdhui ncessaire pour que ceux qui y sont confronts ne soient pas oublis, car ils ont pour caractristique de chercher  cacher une situation trop souvent synonyme dchec. Pourtant faire face aux situations de la vie quotidienne sans avoir recours  lcrit exige beaucoup de courage et de volont, et la mise en place dhabiles stratgies de contournement.        En France :3 100 000 personnes       3 100 000 personnes, soit 9% de la population age de 18  65 ans vivant en France mtropolitaine et ayant t scolarise en France sont en situation dillettrisme.    C'est l'information qui ressort des rsultats de l'enqute ralise par l'Insee et l'ANLCI (Agence nationale de lutte contre l'illettrisme) en 2004-2005. (Pour la premire fois, en 2004-2005, une enqute portant sur la population age de 18  65 ans a t ralise en France mtropolitaine auprs dun chantillon de plus de 10 000 personnes.)      Qu'est-ce que l'illettrisme:      Cest une chose que darriver dans un pays dont on ne parle pas la langue, et de devoir lapprendre : cest le cas des immigrs qui en France doivent apprendre le Fran?ais qui est pour eux une langue trangre.  Cest une chose que de navoir jamais t scolaris, dtre analphabte, comme le sont beaucoup dhommes et surtout de femmes dans les pays o la scolarit nest pas obligatoire.    Mais cest vivre une toute autre situation que de se trouver, alors que lon a t scolaris en France, dans lincapacit de faire un chque, de lire un panneau indicateur, de retirer seul de largent dun distributeur automatique, de lire des consignes de scurit, dcrire une liste de courses, de lire le bulletin scolaire de  son enfant Cest vivre une situation trs difficile, que lon cherche le plus souvent  cacher de peur dtre  stigmatis, que de ne pas ma?triser la base de la base, la lecture, lcriture, le calcul, les comptences de base indispensables pour tre autonome dans les situations simples de la vie courante : cest cela tre confront  lillettrisme.   Et ne vous faites aucune illusion, cela ne va pas s'arrter, mais bon, c'est un choix politique, non ?     D'autrepart cela estd'autant plus grave maintenant qu'auparavant, le service militaire, servait en quelque sorte de moyen de dtection....... mais cette instance a t supprime.................... donc ................. il n'y a plus de moyen de contr?le vraiment fiable.

Cela est lourd de consquences. La logique reste de la logique, mais la nature humaine, elle, a sa propre logique qui dpasse la simple logique. Ce qui en dcoule c'est une manire de penser consensuelle base autour du chiffre, de l'utilitarisme, du systme conomique.

Dans le jeu du monde, on constate que les pays les plus "dvelopps" sont indiffrents devant le problme de l'illttrisme dans le tiers monde, par exemple. Alors ces peuples, condamns dans l'illttrisme, ne sont que des moutons; ils n'ont pas appris comment faire fonctionner leur   cerveau, comment agir, comment ragir, comment et quand revendiquer et  quoi: ils vivent dans l'obscurit.  Mais le comportement des pays dits dvelopps envers leurs propres citoyens est diffrent. D'habitude, ces pays ont un taux d'illttrisme qui n'est pas lev mais le risque se trouve ailleurs. Ils offrent un systme d'enseignement trop born, trop restreint orientant leurs citoyens l o ils veulent. Je trouve cela une hyprocrisie.

WHZfufQWaa	Si c'tait concert, on pourrait penser qu'il s'agit de stratgie mais je crains qu'il ne s'agisse simplement d'une nime scne de mnage .... En tout cas comme je suis tomb par hasard sur la 3 sur une dclaration royale qui disait "Bayrou n'a pas compris le sens de l'histoire " en refusant l'alliance systmatique avec le PS, j'en dduis et Bayrou (qui se prenait pour Henri IV) probablement aussi que dornavant l'Histoire de France passe par Sgolne Royal. Et donc Hollande n'en est pas encore persuad ......tout comme les 48 millions d'lecteurs fran?ais, enfin je l'espre.|`|db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	C'est un partis sans dirigeant, donc il n'est pas dirig et forcment ?a part dans tout les sens...

On a vu ce que ?a donnait comme rsultat dans d'autres partis...|`|d5c122bb0da8c311325ab02a03d8cfeaaa	Je pense que chacun voulant tirer profit et la couverture  soi, ils provoquent une vritable cacophonie au sein de la gauche. Je plains les lecteurs de gauche dimanche, sacr dilemne!    Je ne dis pas que cela les empchera de voter, je ne les prends pas pour des demeurs, je dis seulement qui voter dans un tel contexte de discordance.|`|7UukYNZ2aa	Ce n'est pas la premire fois o Sgo contredit Hollande ou inversement...

Et franchement si je trouve ce tir dans les pattes perptuel un peu puril au PS...  Cela ne m'empchera aucunement de voter..    Pour finir les lecteurs du Modem sont libres de voter pour qui ils veulent car je ne suis pas sur qu'un Modemiste tendance gauche ira voter pour un UMP... tout comme un tendance droite pour le PS...    @Zexzt: parler d'une seule voix en permanence, je suis dsol mais ca fait un peu secte quand meme (ps: et cela fait longtemps que j'ai ma carte pour aller voter ;-) )|`|a949dbef51f190d1941977e26621c52faa	Leur stratgie c'est de promettre tout et son contraire, comme ?a ils ont toujours raison (et toujours tort mais ?a ils le cachent bien), il suffit simplement de citer la bonne personne. Le PS est un fourre-tout et un attrape nigaud !|`|L0h6dkIZaa	Il faudra que les socialistes s'habituent  cette stratgie qui consiste  ce que Royal dise blanc quand Hollande dit noir.    Cette stratgie de la godille risque encore de dgo?ter les derniers militants socialistes.    La PS joue aussi la stratgie de l'lastique, en combinant des alliances avec l'extrme gauche et des alliances avec le centre-droit du MODEM.  Cette stratgie l risque de drouter les lecteurs socialistes qui prfront voter pour l'original plut?t que pour la copie revue et corrige  la sauce politicienne.|`|7031b94eb69b475e7c99355dd503cac0aa	tant qu il y aura hollande et royal au parti socialiste rien ne sera credible aucun ne propose un programme qui tient debout quand l un fait l autre defait aucune entente ne sera possible|`|tDJCBk8kaa	Ils sont fatiguants.
67a6484a1fe90bdb8b336e4a30461d01aa	Et la stupidit du modem, elle la regrette Marielle de Sarmez ?...........................    Delano lui a demande de dire clairement ses intentions avant le premier tour....................    Mais ele pensait tellement faire plus, ainsi est prit qui croyait prendre........................    Et c'est lui qui est sectaire ?...................    Ben voyons.................|`|db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	Je crois surtout que les alliances ne se font que lorsqu'il y en a besoin. En l'occurence il fera sans le MODEM car il n'en a pas besoin. Aprs tout c'est logique, la gauche n'a jamais vraiment pron d'ouverture (sauf sgo qui a demand aux militants du modem de voter  gauche...) ?a ne me surprend donc pas.|`|TkDMOo0Daa	Delanoe est un homme tres prudent, il sait ce qu il fait  Berny.|`|a96ae4ab7f0e2f66a2d37bdd82359adbaa	Delano a bien raison : on ne s'allie pas avec les suppots du grand capital si on peut faire autrement et c'est son cas!......|`|bf416b9ee8c72614c5db6bfc6d0a12e9aa	Il a raison Delanoe , de toute fa?on Bayrou est GRILLE ?????????????|`|4IZhHQjuaa	En aucun cas: il a mille fois raison. Le Modem (comme Mme de Panafieu d'ailleurs) a la dfaite amre, c'est aussi simple que ?a! Delano? n'a absolument pas besoin d'eux. Qu'ils se fassent  l'ide, les petits Modem qui voulaient jouer les arbitres. Quand on a perdu on n'est pas en mesure de la ramener! C'est une rgle politique de base! Et pourquoi avant le premier tour et les appels rpts de Delano?  un partenariat, de Sarnez n'a pas rpondu? Il avait t plus que clair, pourtant! Il fallait saisir sa chance alors. Dommage pour elle.|`|EB711j8oaa	L'UMP ne doit pas s'allier avec le PS !!!|`|9fe95440823d85738965b05d7526b634aa	Je peux comprendre la raction de B Delano envers le MoDem, mme si je pense que c'est dommage.    Par contre, ce que je ne comprends pas, c'est pourquoi il accorde autant d'importance au verts.    En effet, il a t oblig de les subir pendant son septennat. Ils ont us et abus de leur pouvoir, ils lui en ont fait bav avec leurs chantages  chaque anne.  Aujourd'hui, il n'a plus besoin d'eux, avant mme le premier tour, ils ont dj commenc  exiger ! et pourtant il leur tend la main, sachant trs bien que dans moins de 6 mois , ils vont tenter de la mordre !|`|83RylB8Iaa	du sectarisme il a une liste d'ouverture  gauche en quoi est il sectaire !!! et cette liste lui permet de gagner pourquoi l'elargire d'avantage au risque de deplaire  ses partenaires actuels !!!|`|wmmGUUDVaa	Si Bayrou avait fait des accords globaux avec les uns ou les autres, il aurait sign sa disparition en tant qu'entit politique.    Delano? a la main et n'a pas besoin d'un accord avec Mme de Sarnez.    Ceci dit, je prfre encore le "sectarisme" de Bayrou ou Delano? que la corruption gnralise, des lecteurs jusqu'aux politiciens de haut rang, en passant par les catgories professionnelles ou les groupes religieux, qui svit dans notre pays.    Aux urnes citoyens!  Vive la RE PU BLI QUE Fran?aise!

Ce sont deux objectis diffrents.|`|388ab42c95803f3d32395f2bc143ba44aa	Ce qui est surtout choquant, c'est que certains reprsentants du  Modem sont prts  rejoindre des listes d'union de la gauche o il y a des communistes.|`|Izc3m9ARaa	il a raison il c'est fait avoir avec les vert il ont transformer paris en merdier  c'est eux qui commandais il devrais virer tout les vert  c'est de la verole cette secte c'est pas un partis|`|c6KHhbWTaa	Dans ce cas pourquoi le Modem soutient il l'UMP dans le XV eme ?  faut savoir ce qu'on veut aussi dans la vie....

KM9t2Wemaa	A chaque election la gauche se dfoule sur la droite pour montrer qu'elle existe et cacher qu'elle n'a pas de projet viable et fiable sauf de faire rever des pauvres gens qui croient au pre noel!!! je les plains, ils ne prennent pas de risques et critiquent, attaquent la droite sans arret pour ?a ils sont fort, pour le reste...|`|vAqdfxKkaa	Non, c'est la droite sarkozienne qui est en train de se replier sur elle mme, en bonne secte ? qu'elle est.    Petit  petit sarkozy arrive  vous faire voir les gens "extrieurs" comme des ennemis avec qui on ne doit pas dbattre, parce que dangereux et sournois.    Si tu pars du principe que vouloir changer quelques rgles dans cette socit est un blasphme et un appel  la guerre, ca confirme ce que je dis.    Tes ma?tres ne sont pas les miens, d'o je m'autorise  rver d'une rpartition moins injuste sans ressentir cette culpabilit qui pse sur les encarts de droite comme une chape de plomb, savamment alourdie par les puissants.|`|iGVXxHwDaa	C'est l'UMP qui entretient ce climat : insultes, non respect, cassure du pays, ...|`|db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	C'est injurieux pour les pays o il y a rellement une guerre civile, mais tout le monde aura compris qu'il a fait une "hyperbole" bref, qu'il en a rajout.

Si Fillon voit une guerre civile quand un cul-terreux invective le prsident, il faut tout de suite faire interdire la presse libre et foutre Lotard au goulag !    Et si l'UMP se prend sa branle aux municipales, tu vas nous parler de gnocide ?    Marre des pleureuses de l'UMP, de ces "pauvres petites victimes" pathtiques... Si Sarko veut que tout le monde l'aime et si l'UMP veut gagner les lections, ils n'ont qu' faire ce qu'il faut pour. C'est bien joli de passer  la tl, d'aller  Disneyland ou en vacances, mais c'est pas ce que les gens attendent d'un prsident. Que ?a ne fasse pas plaisir  ses groupies, c'est leur problme.

Le "climat de guerre civile'" made in Fillon, ?a me fait penser aux commentaires des journalistes diant que les fran?ais sont pris en otage par les grves (sauf celles des professions votant  droite comme les taxis, bizarrement...).

9KBZ0Eg3aa	This school is a very intensive 10 -14 week course. You will PT 3 times week plus your school studies. You will work with the best Tower and RADAR simulator in the world.  If your up for the challenge you will become one of the best of fleet or rock out and become fleet airman or seaman. This is the best job in the Navy . You will work hard with your mind.  AC's work hard and are also known to also play hard.  You can not work more the 8 hours in a row if you are certified control tower operator.  Your work space on the ship is in an air condition space and you will only work radar. The tower is run by the Air Boss.  On shore its just like you local airport.  The AC rate has flexed the sea shore rotation from 3 years shore on then you must do the three years on the ship.  It is all based on rank structure.  Ask you recurtier to see the sea shore rotation matrix'sfor AC.  You may be able to terminate shore duty once your fully qualified, if you want after a minimum of 2 years at the shore location.  P cola is great place to go, but stay focused on your school the enjoy after graduation. The Navy Air Traffic Control rating is the only rate were if you don't get qualified you will lose you rate and be forced to convert to another rate at the needs of the Navy from 1 years in the navy until 18 years.   You must get quals to survive in the AC rate. Good luck and keep them separted.|`|LzHZrUc9aa	If you are gonna be a ATC in the navy then i would assume that you'd be on an air craft carrier almost all of the time.

Le film fait par la vice prsidente des familles d'accueil, qui a su garder son poste  FR3 contre quelques arrangements bien respects.    extrait non interrompu de la  lettre du 16/01/08    Djamous est arriv avec les premiers enfants, le 21/09/2007, prsent par le chef de village comme ? orphelin du Darfour ? et dont la mre serait morte en couche.  Qqs jours plus tard, alors que je revenais dun village, une de mes traductrices me dit qu ? une femme est venue  peine 6mn, a embrass Djamous et est repartie ? et que ctait, pense-t-elle la mre.  ? Comment ?a la mre ? ? ai-je demand ;  Jai demand  la voir le plus vite possible et parce que les Tchadiens connaissaient trs bien la rgion (des 2 cots de la frontire) ils lont fait venir 2 ou 3 jours plus tard.  Elle me dit tre la tante de Djamous, sa s?ur (morte en couche prcise-t-elle) tait la mre de Djamous . Elle est juste venue voir si tout allait bien pour lui mais ne souhaite pas reprendre lenfant car elle mme a une famille et ne soccupait de toute fa?on pas de Djamous, ou ? partiellement ?, la ? communaut sen chargeait ?.  Devant ses explications bien trop floues, je dcide de ne rien dcider  la hate. La femme repart et reviendra qqs jours plus tard,  ma demande, pousse par mes traducteurs (en qui jai totalement confiance) qui continuent de penser que cest la mre. Entre temps dautres enfants partent  Abch mais pas Djamous, que je ne considre Tjs pas comme ? vacuable ?.  Lorsquelle revient, cest pour me dire que finalement, elle est la mre adoptive. Mes traducteurs posent et reposent des questions et elle finit par dire quelle est la vrai mre, mais que depuis la mort du pre de Djamous (il avait un mois) elle sest remarie et a une autre famille  soccuper. Elle me dit vouloir le laisser ? 3 ou 4 jours ?, ce  quoi je rponds que cela nest pas possible. Elle me dit alors vouloir le laisser ? 3 ou 4 ans ?  Abch, ma rponse est la mme, il faut quelle le reprenne.  Il est vrai que le passage de M.Agns me montre ? donneuse de le?ons ?. Et pourtant ce ntait pas mon intention, ce ntait plut?t que mon dsarroi face  la difficult des enqutes sur le statut des enfants. Jtais ? pousse ? par mes traducteurs qui me rptaient sans cesse ? Emilie ne renvoie pas les enfants en brousse, cest trop dangereux, ils souffrent trop l-bas ? et par Djamous qui me disait tous les jours vouloir aller  Abch, vouloir aller  Abch (et ? manger des macaronis ? mais ?a, on na jamais compris do il tenait  cette ide !).  Cette femme repart en me demandant un dlai de rflexion, ce que jaccepte. Mais je nai jamais revu cette dame. Il est vident que jai t trop faible et que jaurai du le lui remettre, puisque de toute manire, il y avait un lien indniable quel quil soit entre les deux.. Jai impos de reprendre lenfant  dautres femmes mais je nai pas pu pour Djamous.  Quasi toujours, les enfants qui repartaient le faisaient avec leur mre et ds presque tous les cas, ctait un enfant dun premier mariage. Le pre s tait remari et ne voulait plus avoir en charge les enfants du premier mariage. Children Rescue tait ? loccasion ?. Lorsque la mre tait aux champs ou au march, le pre venait prendre lenfant (ou les enfants) lamenait  un des chefs de village avec qui on travaillait (tout se sait trs vite l-bas), le prsentait comme un orphelin et le chef  me lamenait.  Et 2 ou 3 jours aprs, une femme pleure arrivait au centre ? rclamer ? son enfant et me raconter son histoire.  Cest ainsi quau moins une vingtaine denfants sont repartis. Et certaines mres me demandaient de garder lenfant qqs jours, le temps du Ramadan ou qqs annes. Mais je refusais, systmatiquement. Et lexception sappelle Djamous.  Parce que jtais perdue et inquite de toutes ces versions diffrentes, jai accept le dlai de rflexion demand par cette femme, plus je lavoue avec du recul, pour me permettre de me prparer, moi,  la sparation davec ce petit bout, auquel je mtais irrmdiablement et profondment attach, et parce que jtais certaine que cette femme reviendrait.  Mensonge dlibr de Marie-Agns, qui, par la voix-off de son reportage dit que jai envoy Djamous  Abch sans laisser de dlai de rflexion  cette femme. Elle savait parfaitement que Djamous est rest plusieurs semaines  Adr, en attendant, justement, que cette femme revienne.  Et comme elle nest pas rapparue, et comme on na jamais su son vritable statut, et comme Djamous me sautait rgulirement dans les bras en disant ? je veux aller  Abch ? et comme ctait un putain de coup de c?ur, on na pas pu se rsoudre  le laisser  Adr ( qui ?).  Il tait devenu ? vacuable ?.  Et je nai sincrement pas la sensation de lavoir enlev (ho mon dieu, non)        Sur le lgionnaire, j'ai plutot repr la patience et la gentillesse d'Alain face  ce qu'il considrait comme des accusations sans fondement.|`|RDtL7RLUaa	pour moi rien  voir|`|00ftOLhMaa	Ben oui quel rapport?

Extrait de Wikipdia: Les relations entre la Chine et le Tibet sont anciennes et remontent au 12 me sicle, ainsi la majorit des batiments impriaux chinois comportent depuis plusieurs centaines d'annes les cinq principales critures que sont les sinogrammes, le mandchou, le mongol, l'ou?ghour et le tibtain, une habitude qui semble dater de la dynastie mandchoue des Qing.  Voir la suite, avec l'expos assez impartial des deux parties, dans:  http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet    Ce n'est donc pas une affaire simple.     Il est vrai que les Tibtains profitent de ces jeux pour faire entendre leur diffrence.    Il est vrai que le Tibet tait un territoire dirig par des religieux (avec des habitudesparticulires - qui autorisaient le servage par exemple), et que beaucoup de choses les opposent aux Chinois HAN qui ne veulent absolument pas reconna?tre d'autorits politiques religieuses dans leur pays.    La Grande-Bretagne a reconnu la suzerainet de la Chine sur le Tibet en 1906, par exemple, puis a chang. L'ONU a tabli une rsolution en 1959 appelant les Tibtains  l'autodtermination (bien comprendre ce que cela veut dire)    En acceptant de participer aux Jeux Olympiques, on savait dj tout cela avant. On va pas commencer maintenant et tout mlanger. Cette question est  dbattre dans un autre contexte que les Jeux Olympiques.    La France, en Europe, a d'autres problmes que de prendre des positions personnelles sur le sujet. Sans s'en apercevoir, nous sommes soumis, dans le cadre de la mondialisation et de notre vie quotidienne,  un envahissement insidieux de notre conception de vivre. Tout, dans la vie, est un rapport de forces.    Laissons aux instances internationales,  l'Europe, le soin de prendre position. Nous avons des reprsentants qui sont chargs pour cela, et vitons la cacophonie interne de petites gens comme nous, y compris Rama, qui n'avons pas les cartes en mains !

They will draft you for 2 years no matter where you are.|`|as6Gnb3daa	There are three ways to serve with IDF as a foreigner:    The Mahal2000 program is for non-Israeli Jewish men younger than 23 and women younger than 20. The program consists of 14 months of IDF service, including a lengthy training for those in combat units or 1 month of non-combat training. (Volunteers may also be required to spend extra time learning Hebrew before enlisting if necessary.) There are also two subcategories of Mahal, both geared specifically for religious men: Mahal Nahal Hareidi, in which units are comprised solely of religious men, and Mahal Hesder, which combines yeshiva study with IDF service for a total of 21 months.   Sar-El is a program for 16-year-old non-Israeli citizens. It usually consists of three weeks unarmed auxiliary service with (not in) the IDF.   Garin Tzabar accepts all Jews, although a basic knowledge of the Hebrew language is not mandatory, it is helpful. Of all the programs listed, only Garin Tzabar offers a full service in the IDF. The program is set up in stages: first the participants go through five seminars in the country of origin, and then one has the absorption period in Israel at a Kibbutz. Each Garin is adopted by a Kibbutz in Israel and has living quarters designated for the Garin. The Garin shares responsibilities on the Kibbutz when on military leave. Participants start the program 3 months before being enlisted in the army at the beginning of August.     Military service with the IDF is NOT an obligation if you are a US Citizen.|`|szyPMsPeaa	yeah, you can join.

Se in Italia lui non comandasse gran parte della stampa e delle Tv, forse molta gente potrebbe avere un opinione pi motivata...ma non  ancora cos, purtroppo...viviamo in un paese dove per quaranta anni (con la scusa che gli altri erano comunisti) abbiamo permesso ad un manipolo di ladri e corrotti di creare un debito pubblico senza precedenti, un economia asfittica e una gestione del bene pubblico da paese africano...e adesso molti hanno il coraggio di dire che  stato Prodi a rovinare l'Italia...come si pu discutere su queste basi? nessuno per che porti un dato che abbai il coraggio di analizzare, confrontare, giudicare i fatti...basta lo slogan da stadio e il tifo  sfrenato, le battute e le barzellette...la morte dell'intelligenza, la fine della giustizia...Ci resta  la sensazione di vivere in una democrazia di cartapesta, con la claque in sottofondo e i consigli per gli acquisti tra un atto e l'altro.
aMaM9YTAaa	si ma non in questa misura|`|Z0LCmRRsaa	Assolutamente no! a meno che la rai non fornisca a tutti gli utenti un televisore nuovo, gratis, prima di pretenderne un canone. Non so' se mi sono spiegta ma  come la tassa automobilistica. Ma sull'auto che ho comprato con i miei soldi, gi peraltro tassati, perch devo pagare un' altra tassa, annuale, allo stato? Maledetto! Me la dia lui la macchina per andare a lavorare ed io, poi, felicemente gli pago la tassa. OK?|`|jSWGWDTeaa	il canone rai  incostituzionale. Non vi  infatti nesso tra la capacit contributiva e la cifra (che  uguuale per tutti).   La pensionata che ha comprato un televisore del valore di 30 euri non ha la stessa capacit contributiva del miliardario che ha un plasma in ogni stanza della sua villa.   Eppure entrambi pagano lo stesso importo .|`|8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	la domanda  sbilanciata, chi  favorevole a  una tassa ?   nessuno,   un' altra cosa  , visto che il canone RAI  una tassa sul possesso dell'apparecchio televisivo , perch molti nascondendosi si rifiutano di pagarla ? perch sono pi furbi? o vogliono essere i pi furbi ? La ritengono ingiusta ? (..ok allora sarebbe la giungla, sai quante cose ognuno potrebbe ritenere ingiusto, ci non toglie che le regole devono valere per tutti),   evidente che  una tassa e come tutte le tasse odiose, ci non ne giustifica il mancato pagamento dei soliti furbetti.|`|CbWe1NmBaa	assolutamente no!  sia x le boiate che passano in tv,  sia perch non capisco xk si debba pagare il canone x la rai che  pubblica e non x mediaset k  privata!mi sembra un paradosso!|`|HL9rSbBmaa	assolutamente no|`|Tbp4cVMuaa	assolutamente no!  ma sono contento che mo(io)lti non lo pagano......|`|40be003e75762a279a7a7d0629536c7daa	NO,  un balzello che serve, solo per capriccio, di togliere soldi a tutti gli italiani che la pagano, guarda caso a dicembre, quando c' la tredicesima.|`|5f1d201b457e99cb9c90a56742dfb87eaa	secondo te?? ovviamente no!!!  perch la rai fa schifo, perch non  un buon servizio e perch la televisione di stato non  obbiettiva|`|S35svALkaa	no, ognuno dovrebbe essere libero di poter decidere se vedere o meno i canali di stato e in base a quello pagare oppure no.|`|TQQ055sxaa	No,perch potrei anche non vedere la Rai.e non vedo perch se magari voglio vedere solo emittenti locali devo pagare un canone a persone che non tengono conto dei miei gusti e ci sbattono in faccia raccomandati,putt.anieri,putt.ane e feccia di umanit oltre che di programmi.  sono dei ladri legalizzati  ecco cosa dice la Cassazione:    La Corte di cassazione ha, in diverse occasioni, chiarito la natura del canone di abbonamento radiotelevisivo, che "non trova la sua ragione nell'esistenza di uno specifico rapporto contrattuale che leghi il contribuente, da un lato, e l'Ente Rai, che gestisce il servizio pubblico radiotelevisivo, dall'altro, ma costituisce una prestazione tributaria, fondata sulla legge, non commisurata alla possibilit effettiva di usufruire del servizio de quo" (Cass. civ.

Io posso avere un televisore e non accenderlo mai ad esempio, o guardare altri canali.  sono d'accordo sul fatto di mantenere una tv di servizio pubblico pagata dallo stato ma il prelievo nei confronti dei cittadini deve essere pi equo. anche perch una tassa non legata al reddito diventa pi pesante per i meno abbienti.|`|Vr2pqmy5aa	Per poi vedere 4 deficenti cantare "le tagliatelle di nonna pina" , stupidi programmi di gossip, passare il pomeriggio a sentire 4 buffoni a discutere su domande del tipo "se mio figlio va con un cane gay e lo tradisce?" , un canale che ormai come simbolo invece che la farfalla della rai ci possono anche mettere la falce e martello e tutto il pomeriggio indottrina i bambini e poi neanche vedere tutte le partite dei mondiali?

db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	Je pense que l'augmentation du prix du ptrole peut avoir des consquences inattendues.    D'un c?t les exportation extra communautaires seront pnalises par le prix des carburant (cela co?tera plus cher  transporter) mais  l'inverse il co?tera plus cher dans importer et les produits d'amrique du sud perdront de leur comptitivit.    Difficile de dire ce qu'il en serait mais les bananes risqueraient d'tre plus chres ainsi que les fruits exotiques, enfin, le temps que le rchauffement climatique permettent d'en faire pousser dans la beauce...    Il y a suffisamment de terres agricoles en France pour nourrir le pays et fournir les voisins mais sans les importation on serait tenu de revenir vers un mode d'agriculture encore plus intensif, et donc polluant... un sacr sac de noeuds...|`|3sECdyXgaa	Personne n'est  l'abris d'une crise alimentaire.

Je ne me fais aucun souci pour la France  Certains pays d'europe me semble plus mal loti que nous mais ils ont les revenus pour s'en sortir et trouveront toujours a acheter de la nourriture ailleurs.    Par contre juste une theorie qui n'a rien de "fumeuse"    Une explosion volcanique de forte intensite (semblable a celle du Krakatoa par exemple ) si elle se produit en avril ou mai peut avoir des consequences desatreuses car la on aurait un ete "sans soleil" du fait des cendres repandues dans l'atmosphere et donc une annee sans recolte....    On mangerait en europe mais en asie en afrique ca serait dramatique et se solderait par au moins 500 millions de morts et qques guerres (qui enrichiraient nos economies au passage)    Une tel evenement se produit tous les 300 ans environ  esperons que cela arrivera en octobre (mais la c'est au Bresil et Argentine qu'il ferait la gueule....)
Akjpf1gwaa	Vvie le petrole cher.    Je fais partie d'une categorie de personne qui roule enormement (professionnellement car j'habite a 90 km de mon lieu de travail et en transport commun je mets 2h pour relier mon domicile a mon travail en etant oblige de prendre ma voiture sur 17kms (34 donc)   (20 min voityure, train 45 minute (pour 55 km....) puis metro 15 min et bus 15 min sans compter les deux temps de "latence" je l'ai fait une semaine je ne le referais plus (sauf si ma titine me lache)    De plus famillement parlant mes parents sont a 250 km et mes beaux parents a 300 donc on roule pas mal les WE aussi mais la on pourrait prendre le train un peu plus souvent (quoiqu'avec un enfant en bas age trois bagages encombrants (pas lourd) et un genou en vrac c'est pas super flexible comme transport mais on a essaye on le refera (par contre c'est quasiment aussi cher que la voiture et ca ce n'est pas normal... :o)    Mon budget transport est de 420 euros par mois (et j'approcherais les 600 je pense en fin d'anne.  Je bosse au 4/5     Tout ca pour donner une idee de qui je suis car on pourrait me taxer de " a m'arrange bien" mais non je vois un poil plus a long terme...    La consonmmation baisse forcement c'est prouve depuis deux ans meme Mme lagarde se lamente que ca lui fait 300 millions d'euros en moins au titre de la TVA..... donc oui c'est une bonne chose    Socialement c'est une bonne chose car les pauvres doivent faire preuve d'imagination et tout ce qui fait travailler la cervelle est bon pour la socit.  des petits malins roulent a l'huile de friture d'autres font du covoiturage (je m'y essaye mais sur 90kms c compliqu..) d'autres reprennent des transport en commun performants (Metro ou RER a paris , Tramway a Montpellier Bordeaux etc...)    Je pense que plus le petrole sera cher plus les gens grogneront et les politiques ne gouvernant que pour etre reelus se concentreront sur cette grogne et mettront en place des systemes de transports performants pour effacer cette grogne....|`|db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	Plus le ptrole est chre plus les autres sources d'nergies (renouvelables et propre si possible) sont rentables.

L'environnement ?a les intresse quand il faut teindre sa tl pas quand il faut laisser tomber sa voiture et privilgier les transports en communs/vlo/marche  pied...    Donc le seul moyen pour qu'ils renoncent au ptrole c'est qu'ils y soient forcs. Nous vivons dans une socit base sur la consommation donc ils y seront forcs s'ils n'ont plus les moyens d'en consommer. J'espre donc que le prix va continuer  grimper.    Socialement, cela va peut-tre entra?ner des tensions, ce qui est aussi une bonne chose puisque ces tensions devraient normalement tre dj prsentent si les gens prenaient la peine de rflchir de temps en temps.

Bayrou s'est pris pour VGE, il s'est cru en position de prsidentiable. Or, VGE n'a pu tre lu que grace  l'apport de(s) voix du RPR et de celles d'une UDF puissante, c'est donc un trs mauvais calcul que Bayrou a fait l !    De plus, dans l'opinion publique d'aujourd'hui, l'image de Bayrou s'est considrablement dgrade et il est  prsent dans le double r?le du tra?tre  sa famille de droite, et de l'imbcile pusillanime conduit  gauche, ce qui fait beaucoup pour un seul homme politique !    Pour rpondre  ta question, on pourrait galement se contenter de se rfrer aux chiffres de ce que reprsentait l'UDF avant et aprs Bayrou, ne serait-ce qu'en termes d'lus !  Ce qui est en train de se  passer actuellement et  quoi tu fais sans doute rfrence,  savoir la discussion sur les changements constitutionnels, traduit assez bien le peu de cas qui est fait du Centre par l'UMP et le PS.   En mme temps, pourquoi les 2 "grands" discuteraient-ils avec tel petit parti plut?t qu'avec tel autre, comme la LCR ou le FN ?|`|P6uRPPQCaa	Relisez vos questions avant de les poster   vos fautes lmentaires ne vous font pas honneur ...

En fait la gauche ne rcupre pas les mcontents, la logique voudrait que le vote contestataire ou extrmiste rcupre ces lecteurs d?us, la politique a horreur du vide, il y aurait donc de l'espace pour de nouvelles ttes ou mme un nouveau partis qui serait "entre" la gauche et la droite (donc le centre...). C'est  voir mais c'est sans doute un peu trop t?t et on peu s'attendre  revenir sur les clivages habituels. Dans ce cas on reviendrait vers de fortes abstentions  mon avis.    Disons qu'il y a la place aujourd'hui pour le centre mais saurait il y faire son trou?|`|L0h6dkIZaa	Actuellement, la politique mene par le gouvernement est fortement critique, ce qui nuit  la popularit de l'UMP.  Mais cel ne profite pas au PS, qui n'a pas su profiter de la situation pour se refaire une sant.  Cel ne profite pas non plus au centre, Bayrou tant inaudible (ou fort discret).    Bayrou (et non pas le centre) a recueilli un nombre important de suffrages en jouant la carte de la complicit entre la gauche et la droite.  Mais il est incapable de capitaliser ces suffrages pour s'assurer un fonds lectoral en vue des prochains scrutins.

Active and continuous discernment as to what those things are, and how they are best manifested.      Re-cognition of and uncompromising resistance to the ideologies and the manifestations of them that seek to undermine this integrity and vitality.    Judicial integrity; legislative integrity; executive integrity.    The other things fall into place;  a Bill Ayers calls for the destruction of the American essence at a more fundamental and insidous level than a Bin Laden does; both are manifestations of larger spirits; expending effort against an outside enemy is an exhausting distraction when a Bill Ayers is permitted any legitimacy within our own borders; a person such as Ayers effects more damage in the long run---we must analyze who lobbys for the acceptance of a Bill Ayers or passively rationalizes his acceptance---from his backers at the University where he teaches, whether as colleagues or as financial enablers (many of whom are likely from outside the US), to those who knowingly disseminate the agenda he advocates through "education," including the bureaucratic structures established and supported in order to legitimize and forward such aims, including all of the spinoff groups that funnel well-intentioned yet deceived support to such things through pseudonym and misnomer.   ETC.  Basically, recognition of the diseased trees among us and willingness to dis-cover the branches and fruit they produce, as well as the sources that actively or passively contribute to their nourishment.    This is why manifestations such as Bill Ayers are desparately working as hard as they can now---they fear that it is now or never; they have exposed themselves, and are aware that if their version of "truth" is rejected in November and not enacted as policy, they may indeed by banished to the outer darkness---those who have used a cover of "tolerance" and "compassion," disguising themselves as peaceniks all these years know they are compromised, know they are recognized as HATERS  and HYPOCRITES by those who they rubbed shoulders with in the past under their self-serving  subterfuges of "tolerance," and are well on their way to being footnoted as "bad guys" in LEGITIMATE cultural history, and their pretensions to "intellectualism" will be an ironic joke.|`|AOooZvFlaa	H)  Continued effort against Bin Laden and his pals.

e3c222de23484c81cc931a9e0cfd2638aa	Pandering is an easy and applicable comment that can be placed on all candidates . . . more appropriately to McCain who has provided NO ANSWERS to the issue of the economy, the war, the environment, or anything else that is really incredibly important to the survival of our species (Americans). Obama's issues are plainly and clearly displayed on his website (barackobama.com) for anyone to see. These topics include the economy as well as many other seriously important issues. Regardless of whether or not Obama took the opportunity at this one stop in Flint to talk about the economy, we, as voters and as committed participants in our country's government, need to take the initiative and find out on our own about any declared stand by the candidates. This important stuff will never be just dumped in your lap. The corporate-owned media is not going to let you find out the truth very easily.  Frankly, GM and the other US auto makers deserve absolutely no breaks. GM could have continued to produce the EV (released for a brief time in the 90s in ONLY California - see the movie, "Who Killed the Electric Car"). The EV (electric vehicle) product would have put Michigan in the black for a long time and ensured transportation costs remained reasonably low. Did they decide to retool and produce the EV again because the gas price fiasco? No! The corporate hacks decided to placate us all with the promise of a great looking car call the "Volt" with a price tag of $40k+ (when/if you can get it). The economy in Michigan would have been great if all the automotive manufacturers would have been making either hybrids or electric cars since the 90s. Toyota did, and you know the result of that story. It could have been our story . . . Flint's story, too.    take a look at the union.is it better than it was a few years ago.,if it was not for that then were would the little man be,you see what happen with the debate..Mccain had no time he was on a run...now isn't that something.if he has to time for us,then wherethat leave us if we elect him as a president...Our election is in 40 days. Our economy is in crisis, and our nation is fighting two wars abroad. The American people deserve to hear directly from myself and Sen. McCain about how we intend to lead our country. The times are too serious to put our campaign on hold, or to ignore the full range of issues that the next president will face."    As far as th union..Barack Obama has always excited big Labor and other Democratic constituencies, even if they weren't necessarily ready to endorse him for the presidency. Now, though, as Mr. Obama goes all out to undermine a surging John Edwards in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, that cordial relationship is being put to the test. Mr. Obama has essentially charged that Mr. Edwards is a hypocrite because, while Mr. Edwards has said he favors banning unregulated campaign money from outside groups, his campaign is getting millions of dollars worth of assistance from outside contributors -- namely unions. What's remarkable about this line of attack is that, while Mr. Obama is aiming squarely at Mr. Edwards, he also risks alienating some of the most powerful interest groups in Democratic Washington.    In case you haven't been paying attention, here's what's going on: several state chapters of the mighty Service Employees International Union have endorsed Mr. Edwards and set up an independent entity -- the kind of so-called 527 that Edwards himself has decried in the past -- to run ads on his behalf. They even hired his 2004 campaign manager, Nick Baldick, to oversee the operation. (The state and municipal workers union and Emily's List are also in Iowa, dropping a lot of cash in support of Hillary Clinton.) Mr. Obama, the only one of the three leading candidates who hasn't received a big union endorsement, has repeatedly called on Mr. Edwards to ask his labor friends to stand down. Mr. Edwards has responded by saying that he still opposes such groups in theory, but that he isn't involved in the union effort and is powerless to control it.  |`|ImL77nmraa	Every time they bend over he's there.|`|OTTa2WO7aa	I am not really sure about Obama but mainly if he wants the votes for people and no duh he will be president if he comes up out of his a*s a plan that will help with the economic that were facing now and with what i've herd if he supports the bill that will or might happen in a week it might take 12 or something years that would make CANADA look better then us( if you get the joke) ether way theirs no point about worrying about politics now, we as Americans have screwed our selves in the *** because of bush  and i think we mostly voted for him because of how "fun" he sounded  and it was around the time of 9/11 that the people whom were sad about there family members death  voted for him because as the human "idd"  to get back at who ever done this to us and we also knew he was the one that was going to make this happen. guess history repeats it self over and over gain because we cant (and i do mean everyone) learn from our mistakes  but this time un like the grate depression cold war we had no option and the war was for a good thing to save thous people, but this time we have, what 2 wars to support and 5 secret other ones      guess we have to move to Denmark to live the " American dream"|`|S0wk2b8Waa	He's walked picket lines with them.

I don't think all republicans are evil or would make horrible leaders, but Bush has soured me to the idea and it's going to take some time to get over it.     Maybe repubs fear the things we democrats stand for. The right to choose how to live your life, basically. To have or not to have that abortion. To marry or not marry your same sex partner.

6e33bd9cd4dc33ce429d2178ea59f4caaa	"Politics is but the shadow cast by big business."     I can't remember who said that, but its true.      When the run of a republican administration is winding down, there's a financial crisis/bailout.  It happened to the Savings and Loan Industry under Bush I (directly benefiting Neil Bush).  That was at the end of a 12-year republican grasp of the White House.  Now after 8 years, its another money grab.      The banks should just file bankruptcy like everyone else!  Instead, they're hoping that the gov't will reward their reckless business acumen with a windfall.  In the meantime, they're withholding credit to make it look like we're all doomed if they're not bailed out.    The number one reason for home foreclosures is due to medical bills/ie. the uninsured.  If we had universal health care, there'd be no foreclosure mess in the first place.

John McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, spoke with The Wall Street Journal's Bob Davis about his opinions on the economy.   I'm always for less regulation.     John McCain on 60 Minutes, 9/21/08. Scott Pelley: In 1999, you were one of the senators who helped pass deregulation of Wall Street. Do you regret that now? John McCain: No, I think the deregulation was probably helpful to the growth of our economy.    About Phil Gramm, McCains advisor   Gramm's long been a handmaiden to Big Finance. In the 1990s, as chairman of the Senate banking committee, he routinely turned down Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Arthur Levitt's requests for more money to police Wall Street; during this period, the sec's workload shot up 80 percent, but its staff grew only 20 percent. Gramm also opposed an sec rule that would have prohibited accounting firms from getting too close to the companies they auditedat one point, according to Levitt's memoir, he warned the sec chairman that if the commission adopted the rule, its funding would be cut. And in 1999, Gramm pushed through a historic banking deregulation bill that decimated Depression-era firewalls between commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, and securities firmssetting off a wave of merger mania.    But Gramm's most cunning coup on behalf of his friends in the financial services industryfriends who gave him millions over his 24-year congressional careercame on December 15, 2000. It was an especially tense time in Washington. Only two days earlier, the Supreme Court had issued its decision on Bush v. Gore. President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress were locked in a budget showdown. It was the perfect moment for a wily senator to game the system. As Congress and the White House were hurriedly hammering out a $384-billion omnibus spending bill, Gramm slipped in a 262-page measure called the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. Written with the help of financial industry lobbyists and cosponsored by Senator Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), the chairman of the agriculture committee, the measure had been considered deadeven by Gramm. Few lawmakers had either the opportunity or inclination to read the version of the bill Gramm inserted. "Nobody in either chamber had any knowledge of what was going on or what was in it," says a congressional aide familiar with the bill's history.  It's not exactly like Gramm hid his handiworkfar from it. The balding and bespectacled Texan strode onto the Senate floor to hail the act's inclusion into the must-pass budget package. But only an expert, or a lobbyist, could have followed what Gramm was saying. The act, he declared, would ensure that neither the sec nor the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (cftc) got into the business of regulating newfangled financial products called swapsand would thus "protect financial institutions from overregulation" and "position our financial services industries to be world leaders into the new century."    Barack Obama introduced legislation in 2006 to address lax mortgage lending and in March proposed a new regulatory framework for the financial markets.   |`|2qE4LdMYaa	You!!!|`|0CTrD2a1aa	The rich getting greedier and the poor getting poorer    This is another conspiracy for the rich to get more money|`|5Ho518J9aa	yes, all true. You forgot to mention the stock options. Paulson sold $500 million dollars worth at the end of last year, knowing full well the financial sector would tank this year. I have him on record saying he was "concerned" as of April '07. Yet, neither he, nor Barney Frank, nor Boehner, nor Blunt, nor Pelosi, nor Bush, nor Clinton, nor Obama did anything about it. AND hardly any of them actually read the bill before they voted. Yet Frank was the chair of the house banking committee and proposed NOTHING in the way of bills to renew the Glass-Steagall act he took BRIBES to get rid of in '99! Now he has the stones to accuse the right of being the cause! His "husband" (is that right?) was real big into Fanny. Hmmm....  Clinton signed the repeal. Obama was a community organizer and lawyer kicking up a fuss for "politically correct mortgages" in which folks were given mortgages just for being minorities (If you wouldn't vote against based on race, don't vote FOR based on race) and keeping Rezko's slumlord fronts looking good, thereby infecting the Chicago black community. Sharpton and Jackson were using their coalition politics to force the issue of political correctness on our society, since the race issue was a world better...can't fix problems unless you make 'em first, right? Then it happened. No, not Bush alone. Katrina. Go ahead, check it out. What are they using to rebuild the decimated neighborhoods in New Orleans? FEMA loans, right? Then, a month ago we had Ike, and it trashed the refineries. Do you think everyone just told the oil companies, "Aw, heck. You just get 'em up and runnin' whenever you get around to it, on your own nickel."? Nope. They got a loan. Yep. All those homeowners who lost their houses? FEMA loans. Never mind all the swag they got after they built their house in a hurricane zone, and it got trashed. It was all just too many thumbs in Jack Horner's pie. Too many little favors, too much debt, too much looking the other way, too much corruption, too much political chaos, too many taxes. Way too much greed. Not that I'm anti-capitalist, but the fact is, if you're a gambling junkie, Wall St. is where you can make a living. Most brokers are just that. My first broker, on my 18th birthday my Pop took me to set up my first investment account with $8,000 my grandmother left me to go to college with. I had gone into a trade instead, and my Pop said invest it. Anyhow, that day, that broker was sniffing his sore nose and pounding his fist, "Whoo! We're gonna make you rich, Kid!" He was right, but I saw what he was, and told myself to be careful! He told me BONDS! I said DRILLERS! He said GOLD! I said PLATINUM! He said TECHS! I said COAL! Basically, I used common sense. I am 32 and I am a lumberjack. I am now retired. I owe noone a dime except the mortgage. I bought low on good assets and sold high. I took my profits out and left the principal in. Profits went into platinum, now paladium. But I never gambled the profits. Always banked it. That is the difference. We as a nation gambled away everything for cars, houses, iPods, and vacations, while the money was cheap. Now the loanshark wants his friggin' money, and we're about to get F   ED up.  PS- the broker got foreclosed on, he's now a train-cleaner for metro north rail. His wife left him and he lives in a studio with his cat. Turns out he sniffed and gambled a home equity loan. Common Sense is sooo boring...  |`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	First and foremost: the people who took out liar loans, ARMS and had no intention nor were qualified for the loan.

Those numbers make me sick. There are a lot of factors at work here. There is a lot of shared blame, crap bankers that will use a golden parachute but should be behind iron bars, bad legislation on the deregulation of these banks, stagnant wage levels for the majority of the us, unemployment rate and sending jobs overseas, people that knew they could not pay, party politics and the blame game itself. Many factors, but we should not accept fear tactics and the first bow wrapped turd they trow out in Washington. The politicians need to earn their salaries and  protect us from taking the brunt of this bail out plan. We need a better plan.I urge you all to take a few minutes and think that this bail out is the equivalent to 2000 dollars for every man woman and child in the us.

What have they ever done for us, but screw us.    Where did it come from:    Community Reinvestment Act (1977) Carter Administration- amended during the Clinton Administration and the big push for lending, high risk lending began, because everyone deserves a house, right? These people couldn't afford these homes, but the greedy lenders did these loans anyway.  They were making millions doing it - and everyone deserves a house right?    Lenders pushed the sales prices up to make room for sellers to pay the loan costs, which in turn made home prices rise faster than inflation, creating the "bubble" that you all have heard of - then the "bubble" burst. - no one could sell their home- and people started walking away and here we are today.

Look at some of the former Hillary supporters who now support Palin...um I mean McCain.  WTF?

FicyC2TXaa	Not at all Ashley/veg4life/ whichever trolling name you're using dear. You have misunderstood the meaning of the word hypocritical. Let me explain.    Hypocrisy means to claim to have higher standards or beliefs than is in fact the case. Or, to put it simply, to say one thing while doing another.    If I claimed to be against abortions and secretly funded or performed abortions - that's hypocrisy. Claiming to be pro-choice and being - well - pro-choice  is  not hypocrisy.    See?    I'm vegan and I'm very much pro-choice; the two things have nothing to do with each other.    I'm pro-choice because I value life - the lives of the thousands of women who would die without legal abortion, and the lives of the countless numbers of women who die when they cannot obtain legalabortions.    And I'm vegan because I choose to minimise my contribution to animal suffering as far as possible.|`|THRtsl83aa	If they are vegan because they are against killing other living beings (besides plants), then yes, of course.

lkgagum4aa	As with most topics the key to avoiding falling for the kind of backward thinking is education. Think critically about the claims the fundamentalists make and if you find that the only way their claims make sense is to suspend thought and rely completely and entirely upon faith with even a little research and education you will find that their arguments are so full of holes nothing but faith can make it appear reasonable. For instance their claim that the earth is only a little more than four thousand years old based upon the genealogy  presented in the bible. If that is true and it is also true that god made everything then they are claiming that god also created all of the things that are scientifically dated as older than their claim that the earth existed is a lie perpetrated for the purpose of fooling man and themselves such as the existence of dinosaurs and the fossils that are being discovered which they have no answer for because dinosaurs are not mentioned in the bible. Their answer to this is that the devil created these things but the devil is a creation of man solely for the purpose of convincing people to go to the church for protection from this evil. They claim that god is all powerful yet he is incapable of defeating their purported devil. Each argument that they put forward that depends entirely on the person to suspend all thought and reason is open to the criticism of scientific evidence to the contrary and depends entirely upon lack of education and the suspension of thought and reason to exist at all. That is not to say that a belief in a god or our lives being directed by this god is wrong. Only those ridiculous claims that the bible must be strictly interpreted. It is much like those that claim that the constitution must be strictly interpreted as the immutable word of the founders. If that were the case women still could not vote and slavery would still exist and by the way slavery would not be limited to blacks. Both the bible and the constitution are documents of their day which only reflects their knowledge of their day and that they could not foresee the more recent developments that expands upon that knowledge. The primary reason for their claims is to gain the power to force others to believe as they do and to control the lives of those that do not. Learn of their beliefs but also learn of the evidence that proves those claims wrong. As they present their claims you must present the counter claim that proves that claim to be frivolous and intended to BS the people into falling in line because they lack the information to understand that use of those claims is just a power play to control the lives of those not foolish enough to just accept their line and so refuse to allow themselves to be controlled.|`|ajaZr8Axaa	I hate to put a damper on your enthusiasm, but if you want to eradicate all fundamentalism from this country then you're going to have to wipe out about 99% of the population because it's as much a part of American culture as apple pie, baseball and all that other jazz.     If you don't believe me, start talking to just about anybody on the street about gay marriage, legalizing drugs, legalizing prostitution, gay couples adopting children, abortion--pick a topic.  Most of the answers you get are going to have something to do with religion...even folks who support one issue are going to have serious problems with another.      You just can't get rid of fundamentalism--and for that matter, not all fundamentalism is based in ignorance.  I'm sure some of it is, and I assume here you are referring to blind faith--but a lot of the ultra-religious and even more of the moderately so are very well educated and have taken their beliefs to task and emerged with even stronger faith for having done so.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Their heyday is behind them.

Israel never fought against the US (and the USS Liberty incident was already thoroughly investigated and found to be an unfortunate result of a chain of mistakes on BOTH sides).

That would be like putting out a fire with gasoline.|`|9rhmeb7raa	Just prior to executing Operation Iraqi Freedom in March of 2003, Israeli commando units were in western Iraq confirming locations of military targets. |`|pe0S0a5oaa	The US policy in the Middle East with respect to Israel has been a disaster for the US.  It has earned us the hatred of the entire region.  It all goes back to the early days of the founding of the American republic, which was based upon freedom of religion and the right to worship as you choose.  This sentiment was deeply ingrained in the American psyche, which found an affinity in the struggles of the jews to be free of oppression and to have a homeland of their own.  Thus American missionaries, politicians, educators and people of influence alsway related to the Zionist struggle as a mirror of America's own struggle against Britain at the end of the 18th century.  Today the jewish lobby, a great part of which is not even jewish, skews American foreign policy tothe side of the jews.  The blind support which the American policymakers have given to Israel is way out of proportion to the advantage to the US, and has in fact been very detrimental to the US.  American troops have actually been sent to Israel to support them, but usually the US requests that Israel NOT become involved with the US in any war against a neighboring Arab state to avoid inflaming Arab passions even further. All wars in the Middle East fought by the US have been in support of Israel, including the Iraq war, which was of no benefit to the US at all and was waged only in  the interests of Israeli security.  In the Middle East, Arabs view the US and Israel as one and the same country.|`|LzHZrUc9aa	I agree. The only thing that Israel does for the US is collaborate with new technology.

1Fg7Tybvaa	If could very well be with the recent lawsuits filed in Washington and Hawaii. The only reason that I can see for Obama not to comply with turning over his Birth Certificate is that he does not have one.    Patsy S.    Panama was completed in 1914 and under the direct control of the US. John McCain is a citizen because both of his parents are US Citizens and a Military post is also considered US territory. Obama's birth is a bit different, true Stanley Ann Dunham was a US Citizen, Obama's father was a citizen of Kenya. In cases where a citizen marries a non citizen the child can become a citizen if the mother was a citizen for  14 years, 5 years of which had to be after attaining the age of 18. Since Obama's mother was only 19 years old at the time .    We know that Obama moved to Indonesia and attended school there, Indonesian laws require you to be a citizen to attend school so Obama lost his US birthright citizenship and to regain it one of two things would have had to occur. First, his mother would have had to swear the oath since she also gave up Indonesian citizenship or Obama could have done the same at the age of 18. If this had happened there would be records indicting this.  Obama therefore is not a US citizen he is an Indonesian citizen and by constitutional law can not become the President of the United States, nor can he be a US Senator.

The judge has not ruled on any motion in the case except one:  He refused to issue a temporary restraining order on Obama's candidacy, as Berg had requested.    (3)  Your claim that Obama refused the court's request is an out-and-out lie.  The judge has not signed an order requiring Obama to produce any documents, nor has any deadline passed.

There is no legal question about Obama's citizenship. He was born in Hawaii and there is no evidence to the contrary. He does not require a higher standard than others to prove he is a natural born citizen.    McCain on the other hand, was born in Panama. It was a serious question whether or not his birth on a US base there constituted being born in the US. He filed for a decision in the Court prior to his 2000 run and was, rightly, declared to be a natural born citizen and eligible to run for president, even though, unlike Obama, he was born in a foreign country.    As for why he's going to Hawaii, his grandmother, who raised him, is gravely ill. He is going to see her now in case she doesn't live to see her grandson elected president.|`|Ippd6MuPaa	Another frivolous lawsuit by the rightwingers.

Ayers isn't washed up; he's a professor of education, who was cleared of all charges, and about whom McCain and his supporters have been telling many lies. (He never said he wished he'd done more bombings; he never did any bombing himself, but what he said was he wished he'd done more to end the Viet-Nam war. He's never "palled round with" or "had close ties to" Obama or vice versa. He was appointed to the board they both served on by Republicans.)

Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., his spiritual mentor.     Antoin Rezko: "Tony" Rezko is a businessman who has helped raise campaign money for Mr. Obama and many other Illinois politicians. He was convicted Wednesday on 16 of 24 counts involving mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering and aiding and abetting bribery.     The charges have no connection to Mr. Obama YET, but Rezko is tied to the Illinois senator in other ways.     Rezko and his family donated at least $21,457 to Mr. Obama and helped raise over $200,000 more, though not for his presidential bid. He also advised Mr. Obama on the purchase of a new Chicago home and, in his wife's name, purchased a vacant lot next door to the new Obama home when the seller wanted to dispose of both properties at the same time. Rezko then sold a slice of the property to Mr. Obama.     Mr. Obama has donated Rezko's contributions to charity and says it was a mistake to work with Rezko on buying the house.     Rezko is currently working with investigator to lessen his sentance - he is talking - who knows what will come out.    William Ayers: Today, Mr. Ayers is a university professor and a member of Chicago's intellectual establishment. Forty years ago he was a member of the Weather Underground, a radical group that claimed responsibility for a series of bombings, including at the Pentagon and U.S. Capitol.     Mr. Ayers was a fugitive for years with his wife, fellow radical Bernadine Dohrn. But after surrendering in 1980, the charges against Mr. Ayers were dropped because of prosecutorial misconduct.     Mr. Obama and Mr. Ayers served together on the board of a Chicago charity and were co-panelists on at least two academic panel discussions and an academic testimonial  two of them at the University of Chicago. In the mid-1990s, when Mr. Obama first ran for office, Mr. Ayers hosted a meet-the-candidate session for Mr. Obama at his home.     Emil Jones Jr.: Mr. Jones, the president of the Illinois Senate, amounts to Mr. Obama's political godfather and was an important part of his longshot victory for U.S. Senate in 2004. He helped the little-known politician meet the right people, and he picked Mr. Obama to handle high-profile legislation during the two years leading up to the election.     Mr. Jones is known for steering state money to a few favored institutions, including some that employ his relatives. Several of his relatives have gotten state jobs, and his wife's government salary jumped 60 percent after he became Senate president. He has played an important role in blocking ethics legislation in Illinois.     Rashid Khalidi: Mr. Khalidi is a Palestinian scholar and author on Middle Eastern affairs who has called Israel a racist state bent on creating "an apartheid system." He's also a friend of Mr. Obama.     They met while both were teaching at the University of Chicago and living in the same neighborhood. Mr. Obama and his wife sometimes had dinner with Mr. Khalidi and his wife, Mona. The Khalidis hosted a political fundraiser for Mr. Obama in 2000, and the Woods Fund charity gave money to the Arab-American Action Network, run by Mrs. Khalidi, while Mr. Obama served on the charity's board.     Mr. Obama has said they hold very different opinions on Israeli issues, though Mr. Khalidi praised Mr. Obama as "the only candidate who has expressed sympathy for the Palestinian cause" and for his willingness to hold talks with Iran, which has called for Israel to be "wiped off the map."     The Rev. Michael Pfleger: Father Pfleger, the white, longtime pastor of a mostly black Catholic parish in Chicago, has been protesting everything from gun shops to Jerry Springer. Mr. Obama has referred to him as a spiritual adviser and used him as a political supporter.     Alinsky and Frank Marshall Davis - see link for inforamtion on this  http://www.americanthinker.com/2008/10/o...    In his books, Obama admits attending 'socialist conferences' and coming into contact with Marxist literature. But he ridicules the charge of being a 'hard-core academic Marxist,' which was made by his colorful and outspoken 2004 U.S. Senate opponent, Republican Alan Keyes.    "However, through Frank Marshall Davis, Obama had an admitted relationship with someone who was publicly identified as a member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA). The record shows that Obama was in Hawaii from 1971-1979, where, at some point in time, he developed a close relationship, almost like a son, with Davis, listening to his 'poetry' and getting advice on his career path. But Obama, in his book, Dreams From My Father, refers to him repeatedly as just 'Frank.'    "The reason is apparent: Davis was a known communist who belonged to a party subservient to the Soviet Union. In fact, the 1951 report of the Commission on Subversive Activities to the Legislature of the Territory of Hawaii identified him as a CPUSA memb|`|izY3JNhqaa	My mom is right wing and she keeps talking about the Machine.  I was born near Chicago and my mom grew up there so she feels that Obama and the "Mob" or Machine are in bed together.  She thinks tht Obama's expensive Harvard Law School was paid for by the Machine.    I have no clue whether all that is true or not and my personal opinion is it's not WHAT you know but WHO you know.  Of course, I would guess that it's probably not good to have the President buddies with the Costa Nostra, but then look at Bush and CFR, Ruling Families, favors for favors, yada yada.    To tell you the truth, the Republicans are fishing!  They have run out of excuses and their campaign is headed for the crapper so they are pulling out everything they can find and just HOPING that we will give a darn about it.    The problem is the more they throw dirt the more it turns people off.  I have been in and out with Obama for months and I USED to be VERY PRO McCain.  But then he got molested by the conservative right wing who promised him the presidency if he would play THEIR GAME! HE sold his soul to join them and in doing so he lost my vote.  Obama finally lost my vote with all of his squabbling and I heard that Obama is very PRO corporation so I looked further and found Chuck Baldwin, who SEEMS to be the PERFECT candidate.  He does not even belong to CFR.  He does not like NAFTA, THE NAU, AMERO, NWO, and most everything that Bush has done in the last 8 years.  Chuck does not like the war, wants out, but believes in doing it slowly to protect the troops and to keep the terrorists at bay.    It's interesting that the USA backed Al-qaida to fight the Russians AND installed Sadaam Hussein to control Iraq (which he did masterfully, but ruthlessly), and we placed Noriega in Panama, only to have to pull him out later.  I don't know if it was under the Republican regime or the Democrats that we did all of this but my guess would be during Nixon, Reagan, or Daddy Bush.  ( I could be wrong and I'm sure people will be kind enough to let me know that if so ).    Anyway, it's all just a bunch of name calling and bullies playing in the playground.  Ignore the fluff and watch what they say on the "issues".    I've already mailed my vote in for Chuck Baldwin so I really don't care anymore what anyone says.  IT's all just political promises anyway.  The govt will continue to be run the way it is being run no matter who sits in the White House.  It's all run by the CFR anyway.

She has ZERO original ideas/thoughts.  She's nothing more than a GOP pawn.
XK4DqYVXaa	The O-man, Barack Hussein Obama, is an eloquently   tailored empty suit. No resume, no accomplishments, no experience, no original ideas, no understanding of how   the economy works, no understanding of how the world   works, nothing but abstract empty rhetoric devoid of real substance.     He has no real identity. He is half-white, which he   rejects. The rest of him is mostly Arab, which he   hides but is disclosed by his non-African Arabic   surname and his Arabic first and middle names as a way to triply proclaim his Arabic parentage to people in   Kenya . Only a small part of him is African Black from   his Luo grandmother, which he pretends he is exclusively.     What he isn't, not a genetic drop of, is 'Afr ican-American,' the descendant of enslaved Africans brought to America chained in slave ships. He hasn't a single ancestor who was a slave. Instead, his Arab ancestors were slave owners. Slave-trading was the main Arab business in East Africa for centuries until the British ended it.     Let that sink in: Obama is not the descendant of slaves, he is the descendant of slave owners. Thus he makes the perfect Liberal Messiah.     It's something Hillary doesn't understand - how some   complete neophyte came out of the blue and stole the   Dem nomination from her. Obamamania is beyond politics   and reason. It is a true religious cult, whose   adherents reject Christianity yet still believe in   Original Sin, transferring it from the evil of being   human to the evil of being white.     Thus Obama has become the whit e liberals' Christ,   offering absolution from the Sin of Being White. There   is no reason or logic behind it, no faults or flaws of   his can diminish it, no arguments Hillary could make   of any kind can be effective against it. The absurdity   of Hypocrisy Clothed In Human Flesh being their Savior   is all the more cause for liberals to worship him:   Credo quia absurdum, I believe it because it is absurd.     Thank heavens that the voting majority of Americans   remain Christian and are in no desperate need of a   phony savior.     His candidacy is ridiculous and should not be taken   seriously by any thinking American.   |`|Lb5u2aJqaa	To undo the damage your current president has done. |`|PPrGDCCiaa	Do you know we have a muslim senator in Washington?

It would just continue as-is. Obama at least recognizes that there is a problem, in fact many, and intends to attempt to address them rather than ignore them. They won't go away in 2 years, but at least maybe with him, it'll be a start.

141429b21ae0709c3ec89fbf61b5e604aa	Democrats promise to "spread" the wealth.  This means they promise to take what others have earned and divvy it out to those who haven't worked as hard.      Call me crazy, but this doesn't sound fair or equal.  It's as though you are signing up for something that you haven't earned.  It's also a step towards socialism.

yfJz5pnxaa	VERY GOOD. I've been debating this for months with friends.    We have become a country where we would rather take $200 and purchase a new iPod than use it to help another American.    These taxes go to building roads, bridges, hospitals, schools, libraries, and the works. It goes to supporting our education.    America has become a place where if someone takes some money from you to help the rest of the country and you're all of a sudden not able to upgrade to that 50" plasma, that person must be a socialist...    This country SERIOUSLY needs to re-evaluate its values...|`|fcf1212e61101bf3ce91e97128ba80dfaa	Because he plans on doing it using the extortive force of the government rather than finding ways to encourage people and corporations to give money away.

Thats just McCain trying to distract people from the issues.|`|r4xRkqzdaa	it doesn't... it's propaganda    socialism involves everyone to have the same.  those that will get taxed more, who are making more than 250k, will continue to lead lavish or at least comfortable lifestyles, probably regardless of who is chosen for the next president.  those that are helped by obama's policies will lead better lives, but clearly not even close to the same level of those that make more than 250k.  they have to work for it- hence, capitalism rules.    whomever thinks that taxing the rich a little more than the poor are taxed is socialism clearly does not understand what socialism truely is.... socialism requires an egalitarian society, which will NOT be created by obama's policies, those that believe the propaganda are misled.|`|1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	Calling Obama socialist is like calling Jesus a socialist as well for talking in the same way.     2 Cor 8:14:  "But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality"|`|AA10057370	That's what Obama believes and wants.|`|AA10075828	Here's another great explanation, from a story on Fox News (online):    Socialism! he said incredulously to a crowd of more than 10,000. Its kind of hard to figure how Warren Buffet endorsed me. Colin Powell endorses me and  John McCain thinks Im passing socialism, he said with more than a hint of disbelief.    Obama explained that he would implement a tax cut for those making under $250,000 - 95% of Americans. These are the teachers and the janitors who work in our schools.  Theyre the cops and firefighters who keep us safe.  Theyre the waitresses who work double shifts, the cashiers at Wal-Marts, the plumbers fighting for the American Dream.  John McCain thinks that giving these Americans a break is socialism.  Well I call it opportunity, and there is nothing more American than that, he said.    Obama turned from defense to offense, saying that if John McCain wants to have a debate about redistributing wealth - just look at the Republican nominees plan. Its McCain who would give tax breaks to those who dont need it and dont deserve it, Obama said - tax cuts for Fortune 500 CEOs, billions to Wall Street banks, and tax breaks for big oil companies.    Lets talk about the 100 million middle-class Americans who John McCain doesnt want to give a single dime of tax relief.  Dont tell me that CEOs and oil companies deserve a tax break before the men and women who are working overtime day after day and still cant pay the bills, Obama said as the crowd cheered.    Obama asked those in the crowd to raise their hands if they made under $250,000 and then promised them - nearly every single person in the arena - they would not see a dime of tax increases. For those making more than that, he promised to put rates back where they were under Bill Clintons administration.    Did that feel like socialism to you? Rich folks were still making out just fine back then, but we were able to make sure that ordinary folks got a little bit of help without blowing a hole through the budget and piling up mountains of debt like George W. Bush has done and like John McCain has supported, he blasted. We have tried it George Bushs way.  Weve given more and more to those with the most and hoped that prosperity would trickle down to everyone else.  And guess what?  It didnt work.  So its time try something new, he said.    And like that tennis player who knows hes about to score, Obama said, He can call me any name he wants- but I know whats right and what hes talking about is not right, its not change - thats why were gonna beat him in this election on November 4th.    http://embeds.blogs.foxnews.com/2008/10/...|`|xuSR2PZAaa	It doesn't unless you are a republican.    And it is really scary that we have people who don't care of we have people in this country who are starving and have no place to live, isn't it?|`|HuiOpIFgaa	Your comment is right on the point about spending money to help people who can't help themselves like the disabled or families who can't afford healthcare but the key word was people who can't afford healthcare.  What Obama is trying to do is take money from the rich and give it to everyone even if they are already well off and able to afford the things they want and need.  |`|g2idZEKFaa	Because somebody somewhere   .

How do you think the people on public assistance live?  They live on our tax dollars! So why do we need to give more of our wealth to these people? How is that fair? Obama wants to make all of us middle class at the expense of the upper class. That's crap! The foundation of this country is built on the concept that with hard work and determination, you can be anything you want to be. Not with hard work and determonation you can help support a fellow American  who has no motivation to do any better for himself! It's wrong and it goes against everything this country stands for.|`|AA11875616	Thank you for you question and for your opinion.

Only 1.5% of households in the U.S. make above that amount. That's only 1.7 million households.  You can't get significant tax revenue for increased social spending by increasing taxes only only 1.5%.  The entire middle class will be affected by his policies.    For example, who do you think will pay for the 700,000,000,000 dollar bailout?  The 1.7 millions households making above 250k will have to pay 400k in additional taxes. How likely is that?|`|nAwLPHHNaa	it doesnt, mccain needs to do something, say anything..right now hes desperate!|`|RsC4iQXzaa	Cause he is one :D
RNBvWddXaa	This refers directly to the Second Amendment in the Constitution that guarantees the right to keep and bear arms.    The belief in the right keep and bear arms dates back to before America was independent from Britain. It was adapted from English law, though English no longer continues this practice. This was particularly important at the time of America's Independence because of our reliance on local militias to fight the British. Local militias were also used in later wars, not just the revolutionary war.      Some scholars would interpret this right as only referring to the right to form of militia. In modern days, many people interpret this to mean the individual right to own weapons. This also reflects America's strong independent attitude by being able to protect oneselve as an individual and also the custom of hunting wild game with guns.     While this right does grant citizens the right to own a gun, it does not guarentee any type of weapon. Particularly powerful weapons are still banned and in some places handguns are banned. This might change soon though since the Supreme Court recently ruled that the handgun ban in D.C. unconstitutional.    As for Iran, One defending this right could say that American's aren't allowed to own any weapon they want. An American citizen cannot own assault weapons, much less a nuclear weapon. The United State is not making the case that Iran should have no military at all.     However, I think your argument would have more ground if you questioned the United States own possession of nuclear weapons, since it would be comparing a government to another government, instead of citizens to governments.|`|Fh0HTj9iaa	i think it is the second ammendment that gives the right to bear arms|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	It is necessary for the preservation of a free state. Meaning we need it to protect our other rights from our own government.     A handgun or a semi auto rifle are a little different that nuclear arms. You cant be serious.|`|9533fb9762ea928a05c72b30daee8021aa	. . . . and they walk among us, ladies and gentlemen.

We may not agree with it but it is against the law in the UK but not in America.|`|AA11900069	Guns have been widely available for years.  It is usual for criminals to have a gun.  The Law-man can be far away, so a citzen may own a gun TO PROTECT HIS LIFE AND PROPERTY, and that of othe family members.                                  We SHOULD have guns in the UK.  A government cannot trample it's subjects when they are armed.|`|YHPYg7pWaa	None!|`|pOMNE7xuaa	LOL|`|YYLtqZqnaa	Because one side will beat the other side.  Pretty simplistic.  The International community doesn't want Iran to get nukes.  So you can argue their side that they should get them all day long, but the end it's that the strongest side will win.  It's just aruguing over labels and whether one entity is a freedom fighter or a terrorist.  Argue all day long on idiotic talking points, but in the end call them what you want and I hope we kill all their freedom fighters.      Other than that, Americans owning guns and Iran getting nukes is such a stretch I could begin to answer it.|`|UlES4eJPaa	I can picture women that are in defenceless positions, but when they have guns they won't be.|`|cbc99f32f87826430fb6fc588c977854aa	You have got to be kidding.|`|Gbk293mxaa	It's called the 2nd Ammendment. We have a Constitutional right to own a gun.. not weapons of MASS DESTRUCTION.     Handguns and nuclear weapons are not even closely related.  Duh!|`|7AkWFMVfaa	2nd Amendment|`|0jVPdT0caa	Honestly, if you can't see any difference between the US and Iran, I can only suggest that you start reading more.    Here's a very simple start for you, that won't even require you to actually buy a book.  Compare these two:    Human rights in the United States of America:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_right...    Human rights in the the Islamic Republic of Iran:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_right...    Then come back here and carry on telling us the USA is morally indistinguishable from Iran.

Anheuser Busch, he himself is of retirement age and probably is in the pocket of the health care industry so deep that he will not have to pay a cent for health care. |`|AA12048731	yes... he announced he has suspended suspending his campaign
e3d68b15bb99fc580b5722c5a0bb3b66aa	No he didn't! It's a shame that McCain used his name 20 times in the debate and drew all that attention to the poor guy.    McCain should be ashamed for making the guy suffer. |`|35ZJauLkaa	Yes, His questions are very valid No he does not deserve to be place under a microscope.  There however is a legitimate presidential candidate that owes Mr. Joe an explanation.....Like three days ago.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Joe the Plumber was thrust into the spotlight not because he asked Obama a question but because McCain decided to use him in the debate as a method by which to attack Obama. The media attention turned to Joe as a result.     This was McCain's doing.      Joe's had the right to question but that is not the reason for his sudden fame and the inquiries into his background.|`|gSdeVUOTaa	Mr. Not the Plumber set himself up for this.|`|E0dl34Y7aa	His questions are valid but is it not also valid to check on the man to get the whole aspect of his situation? And what of all the lies in his character? Is it not also valid to discuss those as well?|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	He showed for all too see obama socialistic policies when it comes to taxes. And for that the media put his head on a pike. "Spread the wealth around". I don't give a **** what you have to say to defend that view "spreading the wealth around" is socialism, one of the mainstays of socialism. Tell me I'm wrong, Please ******* tell me I'm wrong. It came from obama's own mouth just like "I don't believe people should be allowed to own guns"-obama, 1996.    It's kinda getting more and more scary that ANYONE who is an average Joe (pun intended) who says ANYTHING bad about obama or shows what he is really going to do that that person must be destroyed entirely in every way shape and form just like they are doing with Palin. They would of attacked him for a book that was overdue in a library.    If your against obama expect no mercy. The media... NO ONE EVER strongarmed people when they spoke out about Bush, they (the media) don't do it for McCain in fact the help ity along but they do it for obama, destroying the credibility of all who oppose him. this is what we have to look forward too: silencing all opposition.    Edit: obamabots can't take critisism of the lightworker either. And before the word "racist" goes off in your mind, tell me, what was racist about my response?|`|83df363c0b39116bc273bca1cf432436aa	That's what you get when there is freedom of speech and freedom of  the press without restrictions.|`|41XqvP09aa	yes|`|5ab3665dd0c477ad8d7d745ebc949f38aa	His questions are valid    The personal stuff makes for a good smokescreen if you don't want to deal with the actual issue|`|gau0w8LMaa	His question was valid.     He could not be a plant unless Obama was in on it. Obama randomly picked this guys neighborhood to greet people.     Obama's answer was revealing, spreading the wealth is not something most Americans support. A tax policy that equates to a modified welfare program is change we can do without.     Joe's personal life is not the story in this and he did not deserve to be vetted more than Obama has ever been. He is not running for Office the man who answered the question is and that answer was ignored by most of the media. He did not deserve to be dragged through the mud to hide the fact that Obama revealed his true intentions for this country.     EDIT:  Those blaming McCain for this are dead wrong and you know it. He was being raked before McCain even mentioned him.|`|UHHLaUm6aa	Joe lied.  And it's not right to lie.  Didn't Joe's parents teach him that?  What a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive.      His questions were based on untruths as well.  His business makes $100,000 and would get tax cuts from Obama's plan for hiring new employees, and for healthcare.  I've heard it said by the union plumber association, that did endorse Obama, that in order to have a taxable income of $250,000, a plumbing business would have to make in the neighborhood of 5 million dollars a year gross.      I'm not sure what Joe proved because Obama said that taxes for the 5% who earned over 250K "taxable income" would raise a few percent (as it was before Bush's tax cut) for that money earned in the higher brackets, as they could more afford it.  It was never a dark secret that Joe had to expose.|`|25ff3871078732b22945836ac848d623aa	the validity of his questions are beside the point-the fact that he DARED to publicly challenge the obamessiah, and inadvertently exposed obama's socialist orientation, IS the point-CBS, CNN, ABC, NBC, AP-all went after him like he was a terrorist all dispatched teams of investigators to dig up anything they could to discredit him and turn his life into a nightmare-    there's a lesson in all this: either go along with the obamessiah OR ELSE!  the obamedia will come after you, and if they can't find anything 'current', they'll do hatchet jobs on things that were settled publicly decades ago (keating 5, in which mccain was the ONLY senator cleared of any wrongdoing by the party that is bashing him about it), personal 'family' matters that were settled amicably decades ago  (mccain's divorce) or go after your spouse's past (cindy mccain's past troubles re: painkiller addiction)...and if that doesn't work, they'll go after your children (bristol palin)|`|C3gaC24Iaa	The question was of course valid.  The personal attack on his character was not.    The media went much too far this time.  Perhaps the liberal-biased media needs a watchdog media for vetting out their more scummy reporters.  It doesn't matter, that he has financial problems, and he works FOR a licensed plumber. Avoiding the question, simply by attacking the questioner, is pretty lame.    If we were to begin with attacking reporters in return, for lousy, biased, hateful, dishonest reporting, maybe we should begin now.    The first name I propose, is E.J. Dionne Jr., of the Washington Post.  That worm would still paint Barry as the Messiah, if Barry murdered his mother in front of him. His hate for Pres. Bush makes him so blind that it is a wonder he can even SEE his computer screen.|`|2459e32a987a49305280c9a12e43c44caa	His questions are valid, but for someone who owes back taxes and not even legally qualified to work as a plumber, maybe the questions are not valid coming from him.    McCain used him as a showcase to show that he understands the middle class, but I don't know who this is worse for.|`|tPEUmq2zaa	he deserves to be in prison if you ask me. |`|AA11746917	They're not valid because his comments cause Americans to question the media's golden boy, Obama. Believe me, if Joe the Plumber were questioning McCain's policies, the media would be loving him. Instead they go on the attack, How utterly sad is that?|`|pe0S0a5oaa	This was a set-up by the McCain campaign.  "Joe the Plumber" was hired to put a leading question to Obama.  Ordinary people cannot get anywhere near the candidates unless they are carefully screened and pass a background check, so no "Joe the Plumber" would ever be able to just walk up to Obama anywhere and ask him anything because the closest he would get would be 500 yards away.    This was all a fabrication, and therefore there is no privacy to be violated.|`|8qkJIun5aa	he asked a tough question of the fake messiah so he deserves to have his character assassinated....according to liberals like Delphi above me.|`|6J899sxpaa	He is attacking Obama. Nothing else matters. He is being/will be ripped to shreds. And that is pathetic. |`|bqjgBtEJaa	Average American's have no right questioning the policies of Obama. I think that lesson has been learned by all now.|`|ueKeUZ6oaa	He should not have lied.  Yes, he deserves it.|`|MskT82tVaa	No he didn't deserve all the publicity. If asking a candidate a question can leave you open to have the news media pick you over, who would want to ask a question?   Whether he paid his taxes or didn't he got Obama to answer a  question off the cuff; one that wasn't rehearsed by Obama.  Obama's answer was very revealing (share the wealth) and the left-leaning news media jumped all over Joe's question rather than Obama's answer.|`|1CxcmMdiaa	He's just a regular Joe with some very valid concerns. And yes, his questions WERE very valid!  Obama's tax plan is scary, and honestly, it's the only reason that I will be voting for McCain. My husband wants to try and start a hard wood floor business next year, and under Obama's tax plan, we might be able to get it off of the ground, but there's no way to actually grow it without being taxed to death. Not to mention, we might have to default on our loan if we can't use our earnings to pay it off because too much is taken out in taxes.  A business might make a lot of money seemingly, but a lot of that has to be used to pay supplies, paychecks for others labor, etc...    There is no way that we can afford to pay our business loan if this tax plan goes through.  It's ridiculous.    Although, I don't much like McCain, but what option do we have?  McCain, or living a mediocre life in a rented apartment working for Walmart?  There's not even a point in TRYING to start a business if this goes through, unless you have no overhead.    If his plan was to tax the take home earnings of small business owners making over 100,000, I might be cool with it, but he wants to tax the BUSINESS INCOME!!!!! That's just wrong! He's going to stifle small business single handedly and all we'll have are large corporations that are the only ones left that can afford to compete.|`|L7BSLB6faa	A) Joe probably didn't deserve the spotlight, but he has John McCain to thank for that.    B) His question was valid.    C) His questions about Obama's tax plan are valid.  And the answer he got was that if a small business makes more than $250,000 they will be paying 3% more on the amount beyond $250,000 than they are now (the same they paid under Reagan).|`|CeKLfr6Jaa	The original video that started the Joe the Plumber saga - while Obama was knocking on doors in Ohio, he was taking questions from a small crowd of people in a neighborhood.  Joe the Plumber asked about his tax plan - Obama gave him a long, detailed answer.    The McCain campaign saw this video clip online and dragged Joe the Plumber into the debate.  The reporters descended on his home, and he went to a lot of talk shows.    Yes, his questions were and still are valid, even if he wasn't telling the truth.  Yes, Obama answered his questions, respectfully, in person, on a neighborhood street in Ohio.    Here is the original video - go see for yourself:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFC9jv9jf...  |`|5nFAb6Qvaa	Well, ya see, if Joe the plumber were any kind of Democrat he would have had his lawyer draft the question first, fly it by some political skewards to make sure it was spinning to the left with enough RPM's to be digitally integrated with broadband media machinery and then have an answer instantly fed back to Obama via teleprompter.    Well, he didn't do that, so there ya go. Live and learn people.   Welcome to the Obama Nation.|`|AA10768445	Everybody has a right to ask a question.  Even a convicted serial killer has a right to ask.    However, if you're going to poke yourself into a media-attracter like a U.S. Presidential election, you have no right to expect any privacy.    The questions are valid.  I think that the right-wingers who sneer at "sharing the wealth" are in-valid.  What on earth is wrong with sharing?|`|0e25a2094b8cf70f16e250485d41d5e5aa	His questions are valid.  Pointing out that someone who makes over $250,000 would pay higher taxes is also valid, even if that person isn't really him. But knowing his actual income is important to give an accurate answer. Pointing out that at his lower (past or current) income, he would be better off under Obama's plan is also a valid answer.     And people are often encouraged to check if a contractor is licensed, it is not a secret. Ohio's web site says "You must hold a state license do Electrical, HVAC, Refrigeration, Plumbing, or Hydronics work in Ohio." He says he doesn't need it because he works for someone else, who also may not have a license. So that is a legal mess for them. They wouldn't be in real trouble if they weren't at least bending the law.

The welfare system needs reform, and only people who truly need it should be on it.  I don't mind paying for people who really are struggling (someday, I might be the one in their shoes!).  But when I have to pay for some woman who has 12 kids by 12 different daddies, who has been on welfare for 30 years, who uses her welfare check to pay for vodka instead of baby formula, then yes.  I get a little angry about sharing my wealth with those people, especially when I don't have a lot of wealth to share to begin with.  I would like to buy nice things for myself...I deserve it because I work hard!|`|vYNOotEMaa	It's not just "sharing wealth", it's about a fair system of taxation.  Our system since the beginning on the federal level is called Progressive Taxation.  That is, those with the most wealth, pay a higher percentage.    It's because those with the most rewards, also get the most benefits.  Government provides a stable legal system, copyright protection, national defense, post office, better roads, ect, ect., and those who own the most property, get the most benefits from all those "free services."    Well, nothing is free, it has to be paid for, no free lunches.  Those with the biggest lunch, should in fairness be charged more, right?    If one person pays $20 for a football ticket, and another person pays $20 but is put into the nosebleed seats, while the first guy gets front row seats on 50 yard line, is that fair?  No, of course not.    Sharing wealth with progressive taxes, means you should pay less, if you get less in return.  Those living in poverty, don't pay taxes.  Those that can afford to own 7 houses, should pay more, because they are on the 50 yard line, front row seats, so to speak.    If the rich had to pay twice as much in taxation, they'd still be rich.  And, under the George W. Bush tax cuts, and those supported by McCain, those who are most rich got 2/3rds of the tax cuts, whereas the middle class hardly got anything.    About time for change, and  make our taxation more progressive, not regressive.  It's about NO FREE LUNCH!  That's what it's about, not "sharing the wealth".|`|fe4uvJgjaa	Why should the guy who works 60 hours a week have to give part of his paycheck to the guy that works 20 hours a week.  Do you really thing that is fair?    Its not the obligation of those who have made the right decisions, finished school, or went to college, or just made good career choices to pay the bills of people who have no ambition to do better with their life.      The only programs that the government should focus on are those that get or keep people in school so that they can go out in the world and be productive and take care of their own families.  Taking money from the government destroys pride and personal responsibility.|`|ZWDOzbuBaa	If you are poor, why would you want to have children, so they could enjoy being poor too?  I know its because the welfare check gets bigger with more kids, isnt it.  So you want another free handout, dont you?|`|LnCIs86Caa	The whole problem with "sharing the wealth" is it's not your money to decide how it's used.  If I go out and earn $50, should I be required to automatically $10 to you because you have less and you could use it on something you deem necessary?  What about the fact that I should be able to keep what I earn?  And when does it become that I'm earning "too much" to keep all of it for myself where I must start handing it over to a bureaucratic agency to do with what they please?  Is it $250,000, or is it $100,000, or maybe $25,000? Where's the cutoff?  There isn't one, because it's just an arbitrary number made to siphon more money out of my already thinning pockets.  The moment you allow someone to decide what they can take from you, it will continue to get worse and worse.  This entire concept is essentially the anti-American socialist apex.  Take what is not your's and distribute according to how YOU feel it needs to be distributed.  This country was founded on individual rights, individual liberty, and individual responsibility.  I am NOT my brother's keeper.  Anything I earn is mine.  Anything you earn is your's and is not my right to demand how you use it.  Not to mention, if you had any concept of how capitalist economics works, you'd know that taxing and taxing and taxing is never the answer.  Higher taxes interferes with maximizing profits which will hurt the wealthy, but will especially hurt the middle and lower classes.  Who provides the jobs?  The wealthy.  What happens when the cost to benefit ratio becomes too great to continue employing a middle class worker?  That job gets cut because the costs of taxes and other expenses are no longer feasible.  Am I an idealist that thinks we should be taxLESS?  Of course not.  It's a necessary evil.  We need government to protect our liberties and rights and a few other select roles.  However, government was never set up to become a charity for those who don't work for what they want.  If you truly desire that the wealthy give you something for nothing, I suggest moving to a European socialist nation.  America believes in freedom, liberty, and the right to earn what you keep.|`|RlmkSfiJaa	I completely and utterly agree. Sharing the wealth is the fairest way of living.

My husband's company employs approx. 400 people. We are by NO means rich. Most of the money we make is poured back into the company, especially in these economic times, in order for it to function and meet the budget stipulations for business loans. We have enough to pay our bills. We've had to look at other options in order for our business to be profitable. One of these options is moving the call center or about 200 jobs to India. The cost per employee in India is a fraction of what it cost to employ someone in the US. We are patriotic people who believe in keeping money, jobs, etc. here but at some point it won't work for us anymore. If Obama is elected and his policies are in place we'll be one more company outsourcing overseas which will leave about half of our employees searching for new jobs. This is our reality unfortunately.

Karl Marx posited that socialism would be achieved via class struggle and a proletarian revolution which represents the transitional stage between capitalism and communism.[3][4]    Socialists mainly share the belief that capitalism by nature concentrates power and wealth among a small segment of society that controls capital, and creates an unequal society. All socialists advocate the creation of an egalitarian society, in which wealth and power are distributed more evenly, although there is considerable disagreement among socialists over how, and to what extent this could be achieved.[1]    Socialism is not a discrete philosophy of fixed doctrine and program; its branches advocate a degree of social interventionism and economic rationalization, sometimes opposing each other. Another dividing feature of the socialist movement is the split on how a socialist economy should be established between the reformists and the revolutionaries.    |`|AA10489937	1 Taxes were set up to be implemented on corporations only! not citizens.   2 The 28% taken out of my pay compared to the .05% my employer removes from his pay is not fair   3 try suggesting a flat tax the rich corporations start to scream bloody murder (how come)? isn't it fair?   4 if i was handed Billions in  tax loopholes like the wealthy would i cry about having to anti up about 20k more? hell no!   people should  become informed  and quit listening to  partisan news and radio. take economics and you'll see 99% of the crap they feed you about taxes and corporate handouts will make your head spin and probably change your mind about the "tax system"|`|wJzBz3xBaa	The Parable of the Good Samaritan    On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"    "What is written in the Law?" he replied. "How do you read it?"    He answered: " 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'[a]; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'[b]"    "You have answered correctly," Jesus replied. "Do this and you will live."    But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"    In reply Jesus said: "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell into the hands of robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead.    A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side.    So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.    But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, took him to an inn and took care of him. The next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper. 'Look after him,' he said, 'and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.'    "Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?"    The expert in the law replied, "The one who had mercy on him."    Jesus told him, "Go and do likewise."  |`|y5rg04dpaa	why so hard hearted???.   If you makes 1 million a year is good to charge them higer taxes than to the ones who mkaes $10,000.

I think you need to look at your business policies before you start worrying about your taxes.    Obama has never to me knowledge used the term 'share the wealth'. People hear it and think communism. In reality what he wants to do is give a small tax break to workers (WORKERS people... welfare scroungers don't pay tax, remember?) paid for by a slight increase in tax for the extremely wealthy.

LOVING your kids ISN'T Just so you can get more money...Do you people realize just how little they get?  It's NOT even enough to support that child.  AND, BEFORE you start ranting AGAIN about they should get a job so they can support their Own family, DON'T you think that's their dream?  To provide better for their family, to be able to give their child(ren) the best of everything, education, vacations, activities?  That EVERY Mothers dream for SURE, REGARDLESS of what economic class they live in.  SOME people are disabled and CANNOT work...and this may have occurred AFTER they had their children...ALSO, some are laid off & CANNOT find jobs in this current economic crisis we are currently undergoing & yet they STILL have families to support, sometimes 4 kids & a wife, & the wife goes back to school & they have to move back with their parent(s) & they STILL cannot make it...where I live, real estate & Even renting a home or apartment is EXTREMELY expensive!  Owning a home IS a luxury today & people Just DON'T get that...why did SOOO many mortgages fail?  Because they were given mortgages they JUST couldn't afford!  Americans just LOVE to live beyond their means - it's time for a swift kick in the pants back to reality for MOST Americans!  We need to help those they are less fortunate IF you can afford it!  Because MANY of those people that are on Welfare or Disability are just the so-called "Average" family, they're married with 1 - 4 kids, unfortunately became disabled or lost their job & are STRUGGLING to make ends meet!  Trying to pay the rent, utilities, food, clothe their children, pay for all the things that come up with school, trips, class pictures, maybe trying to pay for an activity for their child to keep them out of trouble...and by the end of the month, you have to go to the food pantries & they don't give you that much EVEN if you go to 4 - 7, you STILL struggle at the end of the month to have enough food for your family & maybe you as a parent have to give up eating for 1 1/2 to 2 weeks JUST to have enough food for your children!  And then you Conservatives DON'T believe in abortion...so why do you blame people that CHOOSE to have their child(ren) when they can't support their child due to a disability or lack of jobs?  You make it seem like it's EASY...EVEN if you CAN find a job, it's MOST LIKELY minimum wage, may Not even be Full Time, HOW are you supposed to FULLY support your family on that?  People need to think before stating that ALL people on Welfare (Or Disability) are spending their money on drugs...you need to meet people struggling on Welfare or Disability before you make such judgments & find out for Yourself just how little they receive to support their families & how it doesn't even cover their needs!  |`|0F8hauikaa	I work two jobs and I do pay income tax and 100% FICA because I'm self employed.

What Obama is promising them is an extra $500 so they pay negative taxes, IE welfare.    You do not get it.  I heard in a interview with Warren Buffet, when asked why he did not mail in an extra check to the government (which anyone can pay more if they want to) He said because he can give it away better than the government.  or something to that effect.

You're helping the person who sweeps the hospital floors lead just as wealthy a life as you :) Hooray!

You've got to be kidding.     Let me try to explain it to you.    If Obama is elected and can get his tax plan into effect (and he will if elected), the following will happen.    Yes, those of us in the middle class who work hard and sometimes struggle to pay our mortgages and our gas bills will receive a tax credit from the IRS. That sounds wonderful doesn't it? After all, we pay taxes right?    But, that is not the only thing that Obama's plan will do. It will also give cash money to those people who DO NOT PAY TAXES.     For example, if you earned $20,000 a year and had a total of $2000 taken out for taxes, even under CURRENT tax laws, you would receive a rufund of $2000. Obamas plan would give you extra....and that is a good thing.    BUT.....    Let's say you live off welfare for the most part, get foodstamps, get heating assistance, get rent assistance etc. and maybe only actually work for five days a year. You can fill out a 1040 Easy tax form, and you will get back any taxes you paid in....plus, you too will get this tax credit money. 45% of the people in the so called middle class NEVER pay any taxes at all but even if they work one day, they can fill out that tax form I talked about...and will get this big check for Obama's tax credit. That is where I have a problem with this plan. All of us who work hard to pay our bills, pay our mortgages, buy gas etc. need the help....and I don't question that....but how about the millions who already get 99% of their living expenese paid by the government? Do they really deserve more? And, how can it be right to take away from the people who earn money....no matter how rich they are...to give to people who don't even bother trying to make it on their own?  |`|ljmE8eLLaa	The poor don't pay federal income taxes.

The taxes go to free things like schools and community parks and pools that regular people use while the rich pay extra to go to a private club.    We already redistribute the wealth.    Redistributing it too much is an obstacle to creating more wealth - you end up with a more evenly shared pie but a much smaller pie, and almost all of us end up getting less pie.    I'd rather have a little more pie than I have now even though someone else gets a lot more pie.    To me that's better than having less pie than I have now but trying to find solace in the fact that my rich neighbor suffered more.

Will finally be out of excuses that "whitey" has suppressed them all these years. Perhaps we will finally all be on a level playing field!|`|9f34ab31e5a41e14a739b21d2955a00aaa	I think we should not base our vote on the possibility of irrational behavior or destructive behavior by any group of people. The black people of the United States of America need to be less concerned about the election of a black President and more concerned about the preservation and increase of civil liberties in the United States of America. There is a possibility that will lead to that realization that is not even thought of in your question that being : the election of Bob Barr, Libertarian Party candidate for President of the United States of America.    Perhaps you have not heard of Bob Barr, Libertarian Party, for President of the United States of America.---Preserve your civil liberties!!!

I7sS4w0maa	He Knows there is not an Alaskan Snow Balls Chance in HELL that he is going to win.    Most of the American People have finally opened their eyes and realized that we can NOT afford to have another Republican Ruin   Oops I mean Run the Nation      OBAMA / BIDEN 08|`|9oKmNTFDaa	either that or he's trying to hard|`|AA12358300	Maybe.. tough things coming and he may not be able to handle...    but then he is way too old.|`|0494d957cdc898138da2648f6185a57eaa	McCain is just being himself and apperently he loves going to war.|`|geFXJc3eaa	John McCain will win in November is what I think, despite the liberal biased news and polls, the silent majority will come out in droves to vote     McCain Palin will win in November|`|G99UDprmaa	Obama is just SMARTER!!!    Look at their educations ~ duh!|`|AA11555614	I think Palin is okay, even if a bit of a religious fanatic. But, in general, I agree. I don't think he's intentionally throwing it, but he seems to be increasingly losing.     Which is a shame because that means Obama will win and that's really scary. People don't seem to realize what Obama really is.     I'll vote for McCain not because I like McCain but because I strongly dislike Obama (a near-Communist Chicago huckster and thug politician).|`|fbiKfvG6aa	I gotta say that, as unbelieveable as ti sounds, I gotta agree with you.  He was AWESOME back in 2000, but since then he has transformed into a vicous tool of the ridiculous right.  Your logic is flawless and I'm thinking that there is a shred of decency & honor left in him, so he has decided to "throw" the election for the good of the country.  That's the only thing that makes sense given his ridiculous actions!!!|`|iPCni8YWaa	The next president will inherit a complete mess that will only continue to worsen. Perhaps the republicans are throwing the election. That will take the heat off of them if we plunge into a true ''american crisis.'' Perhaps they want Senator Obama to win. Because, when things go totally wrong, who better to blame than a black democrat?|`|JXqoWGhraa	Got 4 words Mccains screwed point blank|`|phhAXi81aa	if mccain does not want to win, ask yourself why|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	I agree, but I don't think it's on purpose, I think it's a subconscious thing.  I can't imagine anyone using all of those volunteers and hard-earned donations towards a false campaign for this long.  Even McCain isn't that cruel.  But I think he's seen the writing on the walls for some time, and now he's just going through the motions because he has no other choice.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	If he cared more about his party than he cares about himself, this would be possible. The thinking may be that whoever becomes President will inherit a disaster, and will not only lose in 2012, but will damage their party for years after. Thus, allowing Obama to win now would help the Republicans in the future.    But there is nothing in McCain's history to indicate that he would put the Republicans ahead of his own ambitions. After all, he's the "maverick."|`|RcCJSSMPaa	Seriously, I wonder the same thing...I think Rove put it into his head that he should push the war issue, so to turn people off of the Republicans.  I think they are saving the big guns for 2012, Romney and a much more qualified woman than Palin.    |`|AA10391664	Its pretty obvious, isn't it?  Its a thankless job, made even more difficult by the geo-political, social and economic problems facing the world.  No one can fix it, but the POTUS will be expected to try, and will be harpooned when he fails. Take it Obama, have fun.|`|AA11696297	who ever thought he would win?  after eight years of neo-fascism in america, the failed policies of the bush administration, the deceit, republicans could little hope for a win this year.  that's why crazy mccain is doing it.  his own party doesn't expect him to win, and many in it don't want him to.  four years of mccain and we could almost miss george.  well, almost, but not really.
xXa3eQOeaa	Militarily speaking, NFW!!  He has no more Military bearing than the "Draft-Dodger", Clinton!  B.O. isn't old enough to be a Draft Dodger. By the time he was old enough, there was no draft. What IS Barry's attitude on the Military?|`|sNWQ3qTFaa	No    Really is this the best   either party has|`|NMaCcyeKaa	No, but neither is McCain.|`|d509c99604062928e40015947d7bdf3aaa	I dont think he is but that is not the only thing that makes a good President...so that shouldn't be the say all, we have other problems with this economy right now!|`|H0mtagXoaa	No I don't agree That he is the most experienced and the most excellent. But I do believe that he is the best one running!|`|spuz7DvNaa	LOL HA HA HA HE HE HE |`|AMTYPir7aa	LMAO!!!!|`|AA10265786	Absolutely Not. Barack Obama has never served in the United States Military and often criticizes the military. He does not understand what the Men and Women who serve in the military have to face when they get deployed since he has never served in the military unlike John McCain who has served in the military. Not only has McCain served in the military, but his father John and his Grandfather (from Father side) John have also served in the military and McCain's sons are currently serving in the military as well.     Although military service is not a requirement for the presidency, it should be. After all, how can the president send men and women into battle when they have not idea what it is like to serve in the military or to be deployed into battle. |`|ObKFA5djaa	no he has no forgien policy so he cant have military experience      maccain is the one that has the experience      he was a prisioner of war for like 7 years|`|AA11746917	HELL NO.......|`|PndL1lfcaa	Not even close.|`|b381cDuDaa	No, but military isn't the only option and he, at least, recognizes this.    You can't solve your problems by shooting someone.|`|AA11711276	No, but military force should be a last resort anyway, not a first response.    We have plenty of generals around to provide the experience.|`|gR0i6w82aa	What Obama has that McCain does not is:    1.  A world-class temperament, and    2.  A world-class intellect.    McCain may know more about military affairs, but that doesn't mean he will be better at handling future military conflicts, nor anything else.  It's the ability to deal with something that has never before occurred that is more important than having dealt with things in the past.|`|Lq4306a5aa	This question seems framed to make McCain seem like the better candidate.  If McCain says he knows how to get Bin Ladin (2nd debate), what's he waiting to tell his buddy Bush for?      If he's so experienced in the senate, why is the US on the brink of depression?  Maybe McCain is little more than an  experienced career politician. |`|wNcTEADJaa	hahaha, NO way!|`|7hVFxNqnaa	Ulysses Grant was the most experienced candidate on military affaris|`|rKY8Cjmxaa	LOLOLOLOLOLOL    I fell off my dang chair!      LOLOLOLOLOLOL|`|bd819b499cf7ebd8e54edbc997d30f85aa	absolutely NOT    Obama:  *No experience  *Ruined Illinois  *Friends with terrorist Ayers (even launched his own political movement in Ayer's living room) - Ayers's group bombed the Pentagon  *Can't vote anything but "Present" because he's afraid to make a decision  *Has a resume that is paperthin  *Was only a community organizer... which for those who don't know:  This means he registered people to vote!  *Is friends with ACORN who is currently being investigated for voter registration fraud (They've also admitted to it)  *Got LOTS of money from Fannie Mae before the huge financial crises!|`|2ga7Zdbpaa	no,he will get us killed by our enemy's.and whats worse he wants to disarm us,all of us,the people.|`|dr0Norfxaa	~!WTF!~ NO~! what in the he** have you been smoking?!?|`|qcIM3kV0aa	I am a BIG Obama supporter but I don't think that he matches McCain in experience in Military Affairs. McCain absolutely deserves that title and so much respect. However, Obama is still the best man for the job at hand- especially when looking at the economy right now....VOTE!!|`|Jk5BzzFSaa	Actually Obamas Grandfather (mothers dad) served under patton in WWII you should really get your facts straight before you start claiming things. And it is true that a lot of military members (including me) do not support John McCain because he i unwilling to budge on his veiws of the war in Iraq. At least Obama is coming at it with an opened mind. Obama is not the best at military affairs or foreign policy but Biden has had his run in the senate. Not everything can be solved by ending our people to get killed. Vote for McCain= More needless dying.|`|AA11907157	God Nooooooo and anyone who does agree has had to much kool aid .|`|Wx1PqjgBaa	I'm confident he would not have attacked Iraq after we were attacked by radicals based in Afghanistan.

McCain is a hawkish conservative.  While the majority of the nation would like to at least open dialogs up with our enemies, he would rather use Isolationism to push regimes around.    That doesn't work.  We've seen it fail since the Korean War.  Not talking to people won't suddenly make them more like us.    Obama would at least open up the lines of communication with our enemies.  Only by bringing them to the table, to begin to try to understand why they don't like us, will we ever get such nations to move forward.    Its called Diplomacy.  McCain won't use it very well.  Obama will.|`|8pt0fYPOaa	NO!   Absolutely NOT!    |`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	A loud, resounding and absolute NO.  Where in the world could ANYONE get this idea?  Where is his experience in military affairs?  Aside from his militant reverend, wife and good buddies that is?|`|621a4d17d13b63e02ffc57e463e95ed2aa	Not !   Not !  Not !   
AA11519766	hello... McCain wasn't actually prepared for this, no one was.  But at the same time, his strongsuit was focused on his military angle and old habits die hard as they say.  He also unfortunately made the mistake of admitting lack of experience with regard to the economy.  Things like that don't help when that which seems is verging on a crisis is unfolding around us and everyone now has their attention on the economy.    What Obama brings to the table is beyond me.  And both of these senators voted for the bailout package.  So it seems, anyone can take the reigns here if like you said, they turned their full attention on what Americans really are concerned with.|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	Wow, please consider a course in English grammar.    And by the way, "unemployment lowest ever" would be a very good thing and indicate strong fundamentals.
G2auAv1Saa	I think its funny Obama is welcoming them with open arms when he has bashed the admininistration they were a part of. Now all of a sudden they are smart capable people? |`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Nope.|`|18I6loFTaa	LOL|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	So far the count is 2 out of what 4,000 ?  Nobody takes Powell's as more than a job application anyway.|`|0KFGVrYuaa	Anybody that worked with the Bush admin must be intellectually challenged and endorsing Obama proves it.|`|07TvvktDaa	These former Bush's emloyees can easily understand why Obama attacks Bush. After all, Obama belongs to the opposite political party.    But what they can't understand is why McCain keeps on attacking Bush, considering that both of them belongs to the same political party, and have identical economic and foreign policies.|`|6hl64WCpaa	Really don't care.|`|48335e69585c5cf0917818a34e4b8aeaaa	i didn't know he was giving any of them positions|`|AA12358300	deep down they want to send Bush a message..    they hate Bush |`|Q5D4CRFkaa	that's ridiculous

vYAgIMLdaa	YES!!!! enough is too much, already!|`|AA12358300	That is what politicans do.    To make them look good, they have to make others look bad.  That is what the bashing and negative compaign is about.|`|T7H39gjgaa	I am.    But I understand why Obama is doing.  McCain and Palin started it and Obama isn't just going to allow them to swift boat him with the nonsense.|`|RqeHygq1aa	Palin started it by calling Obama a terrorrist.Do you think Obama was going to set by and let this happen.|`|b844256a273aaed20dd13e0a5e4a82b0aa	The truth has to come out.|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	I'm so sick of it. I try to tune it out. I'm just going to wait until the election and vote. I've already made up my mind who I am voting for, this whole mud slinging is just the nasty part of the typical election campaigning process that I chose to ignore.|`|DHcEbZKVaa	I want to know the truth and the whole truth about both candidates past and present. |`|N8wNmQShaa	If we are looking to the future, I honestly don't think we will have one if Palin gets elected. And yes, McCain would be president. But given his history with Cancer, combined with the fact he is 72 years old... there is a good chance Palin would be become President. Even God couldn't save us then.    Obama ~ Biden|`|LPgYKc3Kaa	I know I am sick of it too.  I just cant wait another 28 days until the election is over.  That way we can get our country back on track.|`|bF5TsXDuaa	I agree with you, but because the liberal press has not treated the two candidates equally, the McCain campaign has finally taken of the kids gloves. So, the mud slinging will get worse I'm afraid as BHO has to defend him self as does McCain.|`|Hoi66cVLaa	I am.  I am.  I am.  All this is happening after McCain promised a clean and civil campaign.  But when he started falling behind, he begun the dirt slinging.  What's got OBAMA to do but respond tit for tat.....McCain asked for it.    OBAMA BIDEN '08.|`|NmZ6Bn9waa	Your not alone  .We are having it in Canada Except we have more choices|`|9Ayi7Fncaa	You call it mudslinging...but it is really the truth.  It is not the candidates job to informing the people; but since the media will not,  But since the media has decided to pull for Obama...the Republicans had to do it themselves. People need to know...|`|inFfJk20aa	i am still undecided but i dont like mccain/palin bringing up irrelevant issues, half truths and divisive statements.    i will decide who to vote for based upon the amount of time they spend convincing me that THEY have a better plan, NOT trying to convince me how bad the other guy is.|`|pkvzAhYlaa	First a hint to the OP. If you're going to pose a question like this don't expect one word answers because you will not get one. Now as an independent I'm more concerned about the issues today than about some guy Obama barely knew 40 years back. Lots of braindead Republicans are buying this stuff up but fact is the undecideds will determine who wins the election. And frankly, we're looking for answers to issues like the economy, health care, and energy. I'll be voting for Obama based on his policies.|`|8Mi15cTtaa	of course we are but look out, it's going to get even worse!|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	YES I AGREE -STICKING TO THE THE ISSUES WOULD BE REFRESHING|`|AA11369432	 ditto, ditto   I am|`|3M1R22zraa	Enough with the mud slinging!    Both parties are equally responsible for the downfall, they're all a bunch of crooks.    VOTE!! people VOTE!!

Facts are facts and some of this should have been gone over years ago by the Liberal press.|`|AA11828439	Enough was 4 years ago. McCain saw how it worked against him, so he has hired the very people who did it to him. I'm sick of having my intelligence insulted by the McCain campaign. When Americans stand up and vote down those that feel the only way to get elected is to give up your integrity and act like little children, we will again be the envy of the World. Now, they just point their fingers and laugh at us.|`|QylWVl6aaa	Truth Hurts.    Are you a parrot of CNN?
uftebUbnaa	Not necessarily. |`|Dm9L3EdAaa	Okay, Mr. Smith.  I get your point and I agree. Despite what McCain and Palin want us to believes, there's no practical way to learn the president's job except through on-the-job training.  There's no way to predict all that will happen.  Attitude, intelligence, courage and talent count.    George W. Bush was the governor of Texas with executive experience. Look where that got us.      McCain has courage.  Pallin has executive experience.  What about their other qualifications?  |`|EZ5mwUF3aa	Being in office for 20+ years and not accomplishing one single thing does not qualify you to be president.       Obama 08!|`|lMR4PpATaa	No, but apparently Odrama does.|`|i00SbscLaa	The president experience comes from his staff. So far Obama staff are the best in the country. |`|v8ZBBU3Raa	Character Counts!

gFcVV8EUaa	HAHAHHAHAHAHAHA.  Sorry, I started to answer but then read Becca's response and assumed she must not have understood the question.  When I realized she did I completely forgot what I was going to say...    Oh yeah.  McCain did not win.  Period.  He accused, he changed the subject, he attacked, but the only way he could have "won" is if he'd somehow rattled Obama and caused him to make a mistake.  EVERY pundit--including Fox news--say that didn't happen.    "Bob Beckel  Democratic Strategist/FOX News Political Contributor    Obama clearly won the debate but McCain didnt lose it. For Obama it was the third time before a huge audience that he clearly passed the presidential test. Obama firmed up his support and barring some major story should win this by 5-6 points."    |`|AdlgOILYaa	From a republican's point of view, such as myself, McCain won. From a democrat's point of view, McCain still won. He presented more facts and knowledge, while Obama tried to act "cool" by showing no emotion due to his lack of knowledge. Did you notice how people are proud of how Obama take criticism well? This is bull****. McCain asked about the negative things that Obama did, but Obama FAILED to answer his questions. This, in my opinion, is not taking criticism well. He simply ignored the questions and moved on to something "more important". Obama tried to cover up his mistakes by talking about the economy the entire time. Yes I am a republican, but I think it is evident, from both parties' perspectives, that McCain won this debate.|`|Tu9lr9BMaa	He won. Hands down. Anyone who thinks Obama won was already in his corner and obviously didn't pay attention.   Huffington Post...there's an unbiased source.  Who is CNN polling? That's what I'd like to know. I'm tired of hearing about polls. Election day is  the only vote that counts. We'll see what happens then.|`|9Izy4meLaa	Here's what they say too:    The Polls  According to a national poll that CNN conducted after the debate, 58% of people felt Barack Obama won the debate, while 31% felt that John McCain performed better. The poll also indicates that the majority of people polled felt Obama would do a better job on the economy, health care, and taxes. Additionally, those polled felt Obama was more likable and the stronger leader.    |`|PsOacBMlaa	lol so 70% of America was already in his corner? That is awesome news. I'm feeling a landslide come November.|`|9c0JAYP9aa	No.Obama clearly won.    Obama came prepared and was disciplined. McCain kept trying to shift attention to Ayers and Acorn and Obam refused to get suckered into it. Obama stuck to the issues.    McCain looked ill-at-ease and uncomfortable throughout the whole night.    |`|kQ7oguBvaa	No obama clearly one unless you watched the debate with you head stuck up your rear|`|oFozOnXGaa	i think it was about even. Mccain started out strong then ended weak and Obama started weak and ended strong. The prize almost always goes to the aggressor but i think its a tie. I will admit that mccain did step it up which was great but it didn't really do much damage being it happened much too late in the elections. I do think he may have benefited a little from it but not much. I feel Obama is still holding all the cards and has this one. We'll see how it plays out on election day. |`|51949469128fb93a48505a98d2630f88aa	LOl, ne he didn't. he's an angry old man who regrets all he's done in his entire life: calling his wife a "****," having an affair and getting remaried.... you name it. he was pissed off last night. and oh, did you see him when he lost direction? the tongue pull out? lol, he's a sorry mad old man trying to come out as funny than mad.... |`|rEo5gfO3aa	I think McCain came across knowledgeable and strong, and an America loving person with good intentions. I was very impressed and he won my confidence. Obama did okay, but I still have doubts about his motives and thought he seemed cocky.   I really thought McCain won.|`|QrBReRQbaa	Obama won!|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Not from what I've heard.  CNN says 58% say Obama won and only 31% thought McCain won.  The most positive thing people are saying about McCain is "he was feisty".|`|01NUrwfYaa	McCain was just mad he's old and useless. McShame talked (mumbled) about stuff that doesn't matter to me. Obama has eloquence... and smarts.  McCain you creep me the hell out!!! you are an old white guy, how does that relate to me.. see ya in thenursing home baby.|`|AA10730159	Hell no    Just Vote Obama 08  Cocaine came off like an angry OLD MAN , Oh, i Forgot he is|`|AA12358300	Yea he won, but he might have already lost the election    Liberals are infesting the media and voters
F6A1saXxaa	CBS fact check shows she only got 65% of her facts right. Biden got 98%|`|siwxWxa0aa	She didn't pee on the floor but that doesn't mean she did well. No I agree with the polls Biden did more for his party then she did. |`|a1CRDj1Raa	Not at all.    Palin lost the debate and is a bad role model for our children.    If you declare to the moderator that you refuse to answer her questions then you have lost the debate as Palin did.    I thought it was really ignorant for her to tell the moderator she wasn't going to answer her question. It was the height of arrogance and she doesn't have the proper attitude or manners to be in a position to represent the people. She should apologize to Gwen Ifill for her impolite and insensitive behavior.    When she did her "shout out" to students in school I thought she was setting a very poor example for our youth. Would her approach have even been allowed in a high school debating society? I highly doubt it. She would have been kicked off for bad behavior.  |`|wig4qCeJaa	Yes, she is hollow, but so are her voters.  |`|J2Sgqkj4aa	Yes, her impression of a hollow bell was a thing to be admired. I especially like how she cleverly managed to avoid most of her questions. |`|m5aNoVPVaa	I thought she proved she can memorize well and loves to play to the audience. I did not see any thing that was particularly impressive except that.|`|hirZcanfaa	Yes, I was impressed. Once she put two sentences together, I was impressed...|`|9Izy4meLaa	No.   There was nothing memorable in it at all.  |`|AA10091004	It sounded like a load of **** to me.|`|20iCt13Faa	VEry impressive and obviously your tainted ears are too biased to see.|`|AA12358300	Is it Politican all about?    they are like that... same as Biden..., Obama, McCain|`|Qjb1qRbYaa	Fox did a poll question that was pretty simple:  Who won?    More than 1 million people text in and said:  86%- Palin  14%- Biden    Highest rated debate( Pres or VP) and she knocked it out of the park|`|oPdbyresaa	No, she was not impressive.  The only reason so many people think she was 'so impressive' was because she was able to stand there and deliver complete sentences.  Hooray, she's at the level of a 3rd grader.    You are completely right.  If you listened carefully, you could tell that her responses were just recitations without thought and she kept being redundant.  I thought it was so idiotic of her to say 'I am going to talk straight to the American people' just so she could dodge questions that she doesn't know the answer to.  Of course a lot of gullible hicks probably believed that she was actually trying to talk straight to America, ha!  She's got to abide by the rules in a debate, she can't just do things her way.  That's completely rude and disrespectful.  She's only been doing this for 5 weeks, it is completely out of the line for her to talk that way.|`|93444f7965a0fb514140fdebe2f1df05aa	Impressive should be reserved as "blown the competition away", which she did neither.  She held her own, which is all the Conservatives prayed for.  She was nervous at first, but then got into a rhythm.  However, she was always too general in her answers, obviously the platitudes coached to her by memory.  She didn't answer specifics on many issues, & repeated the slogans/catch phrases that Sen. McCain repeats.  To say in one breath she & McCain will stop the greed & corruption on Wallstreet, but give no specifics as to how is a politicians hollow promise to gain votes.  Then in the second breath of that statement say there should be less government intervention in peoples lives, contradicts the 1st statement.    "She did fine, better than anyone expected". Is that perspective really whats required from a serious candidate viaing for the VP position?  Shouldn't the bar have been set higher for such an important position?  Or does the public really accept for these seriously important times, a mediocre/inexperienced candidate brought in at the last hour to rally the base,  & who openly admitted she's only had 5 weeks to prepare, basically stating she's not qualified, because she hasn't had enough time to be ready & she deserves a break for her weaknesses.  She's way over her league, but I give her credit for trying, however she looses credit for not recognizing her limited capabilities at this time & she herself should've declined the nomination.  That would've showed intellect, sincerity, & good judgement, instead of watching the sad fumblings leading up to this debate, then setting the bar so low, that the public has to say she did better than expected.  The US people deserve better for this election, because there's much expected from the next Pres. & VP, & the stakes are higher, what with 2 wars, economy tanking, so many policies in disarray, etc. etc.|`|HcnseuUtaa	definitely more impressive given the fact that the country's first impression of her was as a bumbling idiot.  I think they taught her the always useful political skill of dodging questions she doesn't know the answer to a little more gracefully.   it was still pretty obvious when she was doing this, but biden did a bit of sidestepping too.     still, being as she's so inexperienced, i've got to give her props for learning so quickly.  the question is, how much of it is her own thoughts and how much was just her vomiting out what the mccain camp shoved down her throat?      i appreciated her stance on global warming, energy independence, and education.  i found the rest to be vomit....which is fine if you are for mccain, because i thought she vomited it up very well and with a lot of personality.  i would say she succeeded in that she is no longer a liability for the republicans as she was before when she was the bumbling idiot from the katie couric interview. |`|T1uS2o2Qaa	That is an insult to hollow bells all over America  |`|rkZeu7YRaa	the reason that people think that palin did so well in the debate is because of the rumors of her being uneducated were spread (i.e.- katie couric interview) so because of this peoples expectations for palin were set very low and because of the fact that she didnt make a complete fool of herself people want to believe she did great when in fact at most she was mediocre. if the bar was higher people would not be saying she won the debate of did all that good against biden|`|110wHOnqaa	I was outraged at her attempt to smooth over the ISSUES with chatter and nonsense.|`|2276c964182708f2ccd1ac729523dd92aa	Hollow?  As in Obama hollow?|`|MqhUxLKZaa	I don't agree with you.  I thought Palin did very well and had the last laugh on everybody who watched for the purpose of seeing her fall flat on her face.  To the contrary, she did a good job and came across as a caring, thinking individual.    Joe on the other hand made some misstatements.  In particular that McCain wants to give billions to the oil companies.|`|kZ1xpArnaa	honestly, I feel that both candidates did well in the debate. In fact, Biden made me feel almost ok with the idea that IF barack was elected and something happened to him in office, the country would be kind of ok under Biden.  But i am voting for President first, VP second.  and I still say that barack is a socialist lying creep. And so therefore, i don't even want to think about them winning the election. Besides, for a ticket that is built solely upon the ideas of "change" for the future, Biden wasted a lot of time talking about the past. And he was pretty rude to palin when he didn't agree with her (smirks and sighs)    Palin did extremely well in the areas she always is above par in. She was likable and showed the American people she is one of us. Her answers were sharp and she remained very poised throughout the debate. her best answers were the ones that you could tell came straight from her, when she was uninhibited and unafraid of the media.  And her closing was exceptionally strong.    She proved herself and I would never dream of changing my vote.  McCAIN/PALIN '08|`|6dSiYLnLaa	She used a lot of words to say very little!|`|1T2qH4mbaa	Biden clearly won the debate, anyone who doesn't see that is blind! Just look at all the polls, everyone seems to think Biden won except the McCain supporters! (go figure) .. They all had their expectations in the dirt for her last night .. so for her to go out there and not droll while looking like a dear in head lights she clearly 'won' to them. Don't worry, we are obviously more intelligent people than the republicans .. otherwise they would admit Biden swept the floor with Palin.    "John McCain is NO Maverick!" - Joe Biden ..  *Pricless moment in the debate.  Did Palin have any of those? No ..    BY THE WAY! Biden did not lie 14 times, these idiots are making every excuse the the world! Palin lied more than Biden did, even their messiah news channel says so! (fox)|`|9IkF5p3naa	Palin seemed to dodge difficult questions and gave rehearsed answers without much thought to the questions given. Biden has overcome personal tragedy and has much more insight into domestic and world affairs. He is more qualified to raise the stature of the middle class. I watched our family business slowly go bankrupt the past eight years because businesses and airlines folded around us after 9/11. I personally witnessed large corporations cut off the hands that fed them over a period of time. The rich get richer with free market at all costs ideologies with no oversight. I watched large corporations slowly steal all my fathers big accounts when he was selling their products. Dad had a heart attack and would not go to the hospital because he was not sure insurance would cover him the day he was bankrupt. We were forced out of a successful 25 year information technology family business under this current administration. I can no longer support the greed and maverick recklessness of this Republican party. |`|Fv3a70B8aa	no she did not anserw the qestions|`|19e105ab5db2630045e3c2bbc4136e25aa	It was only impressive when contrasted with her dismal performances in television interviews.  Based on any meaningful standard, she was medicore at best.  She evaded answering the questions she was asked on multiple occasions and more than once trapped herself into rambling loops of nonsense.  Anyone who thinks she is qualified for such high office as she is seeking is fooling themselves.|`|cIcJLkeWaa	U must have listened to a different debate than i did... Sarah hit it out of the park...very good performance|`|aNsH5YE5aa	There are lots of reports and report cards assessing last night's debate. Here's a summery:     http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/poli...|`|iljDGgDyaa	I was not particularly impressed.  There was a lot of personality, but not the substance that I was looking for in the answers that she gave.  When she danced around some of the subjects, instead of giving a straight answer, I felt as if I was watching a bad job interview with a less than qualified candidate - oops, I guess that sums it up right there.    As a hiring manager, I would have kicked her resume back to HR for possible consideration for a lower position, all the while wondering how she got through the screening to get the interview.|`|AA11253148	i thought she did well for the first time since being selected meaning she did not get confused or just "say let me get back to you."  Of course she did not answer the questions but she is a republican and that is  the way most of them response to questions.  I did like what she said about her energy plan.|`|GIjuCLKhaa	It beat the 'slick' Biden performance.|`|eA817mGoaa	no it wasn't. pathetic attempt... |`|Q3Wrg1R6aa	No.  She didn't answer any questions. She simply winked and tried to patronize the homemakers and hockey moms|`|5cc93dc15af56e8f47884e200463a48eaa	she didn't really "say" anything.  it is so obvious that she doesn't know much about the world outside of the US.  all of her answers were very general and lacked specific details which is indicative of a person that "crammed" for an exam.|`|shtP63traa	Unimpressive.    She avoided questions, never gave specific answers, and relied more on a big smile, cute winks and folksy charm rather than displaying leadership qualities.|`|X1yZOMYHaa	I didn't think it was especially impressive. She didn't mess it up, sure, but I never expected her to mess it up. Specifically given how easily the format allowed candidates to evade answering the questions, with almost no follow-up. Notice that during those notorious Couric interviews it was almost always when Katie pressed her to be specific(answer the question) that she made gaffes?    Nothing forced her, or Biden for that matter, to really answer the questions. It was easy to change topics and speak in generalities. And they couldn't directly challenge each other either. How would the debate be different if it had those 5 minute sparring segments that were encouraged in the 1st debate?    She didn't mess it up, but no one should have expected that. She successfully used generalities to avoid answering most of the questions.|`|sW6lxVFOaa	She is skilled at redirecting a question. But most of the public can see through that.|`|AA11297448	Palin's was as hollow as Biden's was fallacious. |`|4aF6xRSUaa	It was like nice wrapping paper around an empty box.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Especially NO.    And yes you are right.  Just cause the sun shines through those holes in her head it doesn't mean she's bright.|`|sg2UdK5haa	It depends on how it is judged.  If a 3 year old ran a mile in 10 minutes it would be very impressive.      Considering how badly she screwed up her 3 big interviews, yes, it was impressive.  She spoke on cue, for as long as she was supposed to and did not have the "deer in the headlights" look.    Biden did a great job of answering the actual questions.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	It is relative. Relative to expectations, she shined. Relative to the facts and the issues that really matter, you hit the nail on right on the head. That said, generally speaking most people had their minds made up ahead of time. So in the end, it probably didn't really matter. |`|v3IobQCgaa	Last night was the longest I'd ever heard her talk.    I think she's a nice person.  Good mother.  I don't know what kind of governor she is.  I don't live in Alaska.    But......  I didn't feel really once ounce of sincerity, honestly.  It was just constantly trying to sell herself.    What would've impressed me is if she would gotten to the meat.  The substance of what she was talking about - not a series of mini speeches.  And endless midwestern podunk speak.  Winks and smiles... yeah.  In the end I just ended up saying - "PHONY."      Her voice began to grate on my nerves, and there's a blankness behind her eyes.   All that seemed to be on her mind was "do they like me?"    If she knew what she was talking about, she wouldn't have to worry about that.    Biden, on the other hand, talked facts.  I had respect for him already, but gained even MORE last night.  I wasn't really anticipating that, but that is what happened.  :-)  I'm even more excited about the Obama/Biden ticket now.    Oh.... and did you guys see Palin buying a Philly Cheesesteak on TV?  She made sure she did it for a camera (I guess to show how down-home American she is).  Then at the end, the cashier said, "And your name?"      The brief look on her face was priceless.  I about fell out of my chair laughing.    Sure knocked her down a peg.  ;-)|`|iiji7Wxdaa	She did better than in her other interviews, but when push comes to shove, she avoided many questions, by talking about other things instead and toward the end, she sounded like she was just repeating herself.     Putting her next to Biden, it's incomprehensible that people could think she'd be a good VP, and worse yet the President. She just has that little girl attitude and mentality, as if this is all a game for her. I do give her credit that she was friendly and even a bit warm with Biden, which made her seem more real, but Biden looked like he could be President if he had to be and knew everything he was talking about and what was asked of him. Palin still seemed like she was reading from a script and just isn't prepared to be in that position. |`|xPNNKT2zaa	the bar has been set so low for her that she's in danger of tripping over it.

There is a huge difference because McCain claims that he knows how to get him.  Thus, if that is true, then McCain should be found guilty of aiding and abetting Bin Laden.  Also, McCain appears to be unwilling to launch any type of strike into Pakistan, even if that means catching Bin Laden.  He has said that he will follow Bin Laden to the gates of hell.  Well, if the gates of hell are within Pakistan, then I guess he will not follow him there.  |`|2KRiVfKAaa	Talking to Bush is like talking to my dog. It looks like he's listening, but he's not.

She's not going to be the next president of the United States. And if you paid any attention to the debate between McCain and Obama, you would have realized that Obama did no better than Palin did. There were exceptions however. During the presidential debate, Obama danced around questions and gave no valid answers to any of them. He said "whatever" under his breath once, raised his voice a number of times, and even pointed his finger during the debate. How childish! Anyway, I think we have bigger issues to worry about than what the future V.P. has to say.
uXgzmLiHaa	tout dpend comment cette dnonciation s'exprime... si tu exprimes un point de vue purement historique et rationnel (en recadrant le sujet dans son contexte social et politique) avec pour objectif de dnoncer la barbarie humaine au del des nations, si ta rflexion aboutit  la question: "comment viter que cela se reproduise?" non, bien s?r!  Toutefois, cette question est souvent dtourne  des fins idologiques.

" Non chuuuut il ne faut pas s'excuser devant des blancs cela ne se fait pas"    @Sabrina    Petite le?on d'histoire:    Au dbut de l'Islam, donc longtemps avant que les ?les atlantiques (Madre, Canaries, S?o Tom) et l'Amrique ne soient relies au commerce ngrier, des chefs noirs se mirent au service des marchands ngriers arabes pour vaincre leurs ennemis et leur fournir des prisonniers. Ceux-ci taient ensuite revendus comme esclave en Afrique du Nord ou sur les marchs du Moyen-Orient, d'Inde et l'Insulinde (Malaisie, Indonsie, Philippines). Ceci explique pourquoi aujourd'hui nous retrouvons des populations noires dans toutes ces rgions.            Les marchs d'esclaves se dvelopprent surtout au Maroc, en Lybie (Tripoli), en Egypte et dans le sud de l'Arabie (Yemen). La traite   transsaharienne passaient notamment par l'aristocratie Touareg et Mangas qui exportaient principalement les Noirs vers le nord de l'Afrique et l'Arabie.   La valeur des esclaves variait selon qu'il s'agissait d'une fille pubre (80  100000 cowries, un enfant (60  80000 cowries), un jeune pubre (50  60000 cowriess) ou un adulte (30  40000 cowries).    Cette traite dbuta avant le commerce triangulaire au XVIeme sicle et finit au XIXeme sicle. Au total, on estime que des millions d'esclaves furent ainsi dplacs vers l'Afrique du Nord et le Moyen-Orient entre le VIIIeme et le XIXeme sicle.    Ces marchs d'esclaves possdaient leurs propres caractristiques. Ainsi, en Afrique subsaharienne le prix des femmes esclaves dpassait celui des hommes car elles taient plus nombreuses et pour ainsi dire polyvalentes (elles pouvaient s'acquitter des taches mnagres, tre pouse, prostitue, ouvrire, etc). En revanche, en Afrique du Nord et au Moyen-Orient, le prix des femmes tait encore plus lev que dans la rgion subsaharienne alors que les hommes esclaves travaillaient galement dans l'agriculture et dans l'arme.|`|Im7lfOuSaa	non  http://www.shenoc.com/egypte%20antique.h...|`|YpzAGogQaa	et oui,maintenant pour avoir une bonne tu dois l'embauch  l'ANPE,et elle peut se plaindre  son syndicat.Tout change...|`|f2f764ce90e27fbacf302af1fc7eb959aa	La dsinformation doit s'arrter. Je suis historienne, c'est du grand n'importe quoi. L'esclavage existait dans l'Antiquit, et entre personnes d'un mme pays.  Entre les grandes dcouvertes (disons la fin du XVe sicle et le dbut du XIXe sicle, il a eu un commerce un peu spcial nomm "bois d'bne".

Baltimore cit aussi dans cet extrait :  La terreur islamique commen?a dans les ?les britanniques lors du ? terrible t de 1625 ? quand des corsaires esclavagistes nord-africains envahirent et dvastrent les c?tes sud de lAngleterre, et hissrent mme pendant un bref instant ltendard de bataille vert de lislam sur le territoire anglais, un tendard sur lequel tait inscrite la terrible promesse : ? Les portes du Paradis sont  lombre des pes ?.    Sur les c?tes de Cornouailles, du Devon, du Dorset et dIrlande du Sud, les corsaires islamiques turent et pillrent des villages entiers pour les vendre comme esclaves dans lempire islamique dOrient.    En 1625, les marchands desclaves retournrent ensuite  Alger  dans ce seul raid  avec un millier dhommes, de femmes et denfants britanniques  vendre comme esclaves. Au total, les pirates islamiques nord-africains enlevrent et rduisirent en esclavage 1,3 million dEuropens blancs entre 1530 et 1780 dans une srie de raids qui dpeuplrent les villes c?tires, de la Sicile  la Cornouaille.    Pour que la population esclave reste stable, environ un quart devait tre remplac chaque anne, ce qui pour la priode de 1580  1680 signifiait environ 8.500 nouveaux esclaves par an, arrivant  un total de 850.000 esclaves. La mme mthodologie suggre que 475.000 furent enlevs dans les sicles prcdant et suivant. De 1500  1650, quand lesclavage transatlantique tait encore  ses dbuts, il y eut probablement plus desclaves chrtiens blancs emmens chez les Barbaresques que desclaves africains noirs aux Amriques.    Daprs une estimation, 7.000 Anglais furent enlevs entre 1622 et 1644, beaucoup dentre eux tant des quipages et des passagers de bateaux qui furent intercepts et capturs par des marchands desclaves.    Limpact de ces attaques sur les nations europennes attaques par les pirates meurtriers fut dvastateur  la France, lAngleterre et lEspagne perdirent chacune des milliers de bateaux, et de longues tendues des c?tes espagnoles et italiennes furent presque compltement dpeuples et abandonnes par leurs habitants. Des villages entiers de ces pays furent vids de leurs habitants enmens en esclavages. A leur apoge, la destruction et le dpeuplement de certaines rgions europennes excdrent ce que les esclavagistes europens infligeront plus tard  lintrieur africain quand les esclavagistes africains vendront leurs compagnons noirs aux esclavagistes europens. A cette poque, lEurope vivait dans la peur de lislam.    Bien que les centaines de milliers desclaves chrtiens furent principalement enlevs dans les pays mditerranens, les effets des raids esclavagistes musulmans furent ressentis beaucoup plus loin et durant la plus grande partie du XVIIe sicle lAngleterre perdit au moins 400 marins par an du fait des marchands desclaves islamiques.    Mais les corsaires ninterceptaient pas seulement les navires au milieu de locan ; ils dbarquaient aussi sur les plages non gardes, souvent de nuit, pour semparer des villageois endormis. Cela se passa dans des parties de la Cornouaille et presque tous les habitants du village de Baltimore, en Irlande, furent capturs en 1631, et il y eut dautres raids dans le Devon. Lune des plus riches paves au trsor trouves au large de lAngleterre   Salcombe, Devon  tait un bateau barbaresque du XVIe sicle en route pour capturer des esclaves. Toutes les c?tes des pays bordant l'Atlantique et la Mditrranne furent toucher.     Les milliers de chrtiens blancs qui taient capturs chaque anne devaient travailler comme esclaves sexuels, galriens, travailleurs et concubins des seigneurs musulmans dans ce qui est aujourdhui le Maroc, la Tunisie, lAlgrie et la Libye.    Ce furent en fait des esclaves europens qui furent forcs de construire les palais de Mekns pour le tyran marocain, Moulay Ismail, au dbut du XVIIIe sicle. Dpassant Versailles en taille et en splendeur, ils furent construits par des esclaves chrtiens, par un souverain qui se glorifiait de son pouvoir absolu. Par exemple, il traitait le roi dAngleterre de faiblard pitoyable, puisque celui-ci permettait  un parlement de limiter son autorit.    Le cauchemar ne cessa quen 1816, quand la Royal Navy obligea par la force le port dAlger  la soumission et imposa la cessation de la vente desclaves chrtiens dans le Maghreb, une action inspire par Sir Sidney Smith et sa ? Socit des Chevaliers Librateurs des Esclaves Blancs dAfrique ?.

Alors quelle rponse veux tu? L'esclavagisme c'est mal? Ben oui c'est mal. Mais l'esclavagisme de l'occident s'est avant tout exerc entre occidentaux. Par exemple, pendant la Guerre des Gaules, les gaulois vaincus taient rapports  Rome et rduits en esclavage. Ce n'est pas pour autant qu'un "racisme" anti italien s'est dclar en France. Donc si tu comptais argumenter sur le caractre racial de l'esclavagisme occidentaux (les noirs exclusifs esclaves des blancs), je pense que, l encore, tu ne regardes que l'endroit o se pose ton doigt.  Pour finir, et je ne peux passer dessus, les barbaresques ont galement pratiqu l'esclavage sur les blancs et (surtout) les africains.  Tu parles des personnes aises ayant des domestiques rduits en esclavage. Je t'inviterais  t'intresser  la nationalit desdits patrons. Pour exemple, le dernier cas de personnes aises maltraitant leurs personnels de maison, concerne des ressortissants.....lybiens (hannibal khadafi pour ne pas le citer)  Et quand tu regardes les conditions de vie des philippins et autres ressortissants de pays du tiers monde dans les pays du golfe persique (et surtout en arabie saoudite), tu sais que l'esclavage existe toujours.

Biden and Obama (and McCain too, for that matter) have been *very* specific in recent weeks regarding the changes they hope to implement  if you haven't been paying attention, that's your problem, not theirs.    One change proposed by both candidates is to lower taxes on the middle class. A tiny bit of research on your part would've revealed this analysis:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...    The difference is that Obama wants to raise taxes on the rich to finance deeper cuts for the middle class, while McCain wants smaller cuts for everyone. Either way, both candidates favor tax cuts for the middle class.    So please, pay attention.

I live in Northern New Jersey where "Mike's gym", "Jan's pastry shop" or so on can easily bring in over $250,000 a year.

jWTZfP4naa	just the way bush or brown would if they were about to do such a thing. which they aren't -  they are now leaving it for their successors.     like this - "Hey Ahmadinejad- two choices. Either you press ahead full steam with your nuclear programme, meaning we will pull out all our aces to freeze your gold (again) ruin your economy, cause revolt amongst your people, threaten you with all the weapons we gave to Israel as AID and continue to surround your trade routes so you can't go crying to CHINA like the last time we pulled this Shiz    OR    You stop Brewing isotopes and buy them off us at the price we dictate for as long as we want to sell them to you, oh and we want the oil at the price we've been asking for since 1978 so, no more selling it to China, and uh, see above if you don't comply"    that's how he'll protect your interests. ILLEGALLY.   it's called free trade, and you've been screwing Iran with it since before it was invented. That's why they're "the enemy" it's not important how Iran's president handles himself- he doesn't have any chips to play- by the way - did anyone else hear Sarah Palin outraged that he came ON YOUR SOIL and talked about stuff, whilst actually VISITING YOUR COUNTRY. that kind of maverick diplomacy really throws the republicans hey?|`|u23sBafTaa	  Strikes me as two peas in a pod,I don't believe Obama has any intention of protecting our interest.

Who cares that they killed over 5000 citizens in the last two decades just because they where gay? We should partner up with this great "business oportunity" Iran before the french and the germans got it all!"  .......We don't need a lawyer and politician like Obama....Our president should be a Statesman....unfortunately, to put economics before morals seems to be acceptable in todays world.

There are three things that are going to happen.  Those in debt will be paying off their debt.  That money goes back to the money market.  Others will put it into some sort of savings like me.  Others would spend it on common goods like rent, food and utilities.  Very little of it will actually go back into the multi trillion dollar economy.|`|2P18wyECaa	How very Bush of Obama.|`|eNl8GhPUaa	didn't seem to boost the economy the first time around. but i would like to know from the people that were against it, did you spend it or send it back?|`|gTpOTYFvaa	i can't see how this would do anything.    so we can put it on our credit cards?  we're not talking anything substantial to most of us... the last one didn't put a dent in anything, so a second will accomplish the same thing.    times are tough for most of us, but i can't see justifying a stimulus check to all of us AGAIN... unless you're planning on cutting back in war spending, and, even then, the money can go to better uses.    i'd love it if we could turn right back around and send the check back.  but we're too greedy and even you Republicans will take it, cash it, and not think twice about it.  time to put your money where your mouth is.  if we get a 2nd stimulus check, all you "small government, less spending" folks can mark it "return to sender", or else you're hypocrites.|`|oQUeCV4Qaa	About as good as I feel when I buy myself a new toy !!  * wink*|`|Ba6lYx9Xaa	Totally against hand outs and no spending cuts.

bf1ddfd8f8fee8e9f3032d38cf283655aa	I don't think it is  wise to predict anyone's death, McCain could live another 30 years, and Obama could have an embolism and die tomorrow.|`|en7wgVfyaa	I doubt it.|`|fh12fkNWaa	He has a 1 in 3 chance of dying in office and a greater chance of having a stroke or other age related issue that can severely effect his thinking processes.|`|9eBruYtqaa	no. he was given a clean bill of health. his mother is 96. i know his dad died at 70, but he was an alcoholic and i'm sure that contributed to his early death. i think mccain looks great for his age. age isn't everything. my granny is 83, goes to the gym 3 times a week, lives by herself and drives all over boston.|`|wWvznTJFaa	Look at the numbers for malignant melanoma (one of the deadliest and least treatable cancers). |`|Ac3UkTXYaa	When you get our age,you never know.We're not promised tomorrow ,so make sure whoever you vote for has a good VP.|`|z0Ynd4zRaa	It's possible Obama will die in the next four years too. I really don't understand why people think he is going to die. Because he's old? If he has enough energy to run for president, he's obviously healthy. You democrats just don't have anything better to say. If you are going to bash the other candidate, at least make it have something to do with the election and not age.|`|AA12358300	sure, possible.. but Obama is also going to die in the next 4 years..    You will never know!    that is why VP is so important|`|7U1CQxTdaa	Yes. He is 72 now and in worse shape than any of my grandparents were before they died (none of them had cancer three different times.) They all died by 75. Besides he doesn't have to die to become a liability. Serious illness could take him out and force decisions on the VP as well.|`|mvVhbY1Gaa	Rafael.. I'm a McCain supporter. But I do have to admit he doesn't look to healthy to me. That doesn't scare me though. I would rather have Palin in there then him. She's a real Christian. She'll be the best president we've had in years.. |`|LvVlkQhDaa	It's not unheard of for people between 72-76 yrs of age passing away-    Everyone brings up his 92yr old Mother how old was his Dad when he died?    Found it! his Dad died when he was 70|`|ZqBCRfAQaa	Well there is always a possibility, so I wouldn't doubt it.  Everybody dies sometime.|`|k4Xg3pI3aa	I can't honestly say ANYONE is or isn't going to die in the next four years, four days, or four minutes.     McCain is 72. He's running for President. I'm sure he has a diet and exercise plan to help his health, fitness, stamina, etc. For a guy who's lived the life he has, he's holding up pretty well. So to speculate too much on whether he'll die or not is a bit odd. |`|dyV9MPhDaa	Who is to say any of us won't?  That is up to God.|`|PEtG8knJaa	No one wants anyone to die. It's just that McCain's percentage of that happening is high.|`|rCugrc5xaa	I can say he is significantly at a higher risk of death by old age/recurring skin cancer than Obama. Sooooo yeah thats all I need in order to be forced to look at the possibility of Crazy Palin running the country and vote Obama/Biden 08. That what you were getting at?|`|iTypkWsVaa	The average life expectancy rate in the US is 77. For the world it's 66. That's not subjective.    McCain has had cancer. It is very possible he could die in the next 4 years.|`|38c4fd80c76a2047e7c31f86e927c31caa	a 72 year old guy die??    that's impossible.....lets be Realistic people and to picture   palina s president??     i would move to Canada is that would happen!!|`|FPSiozgwaa	No, I don't think he will. But the reason I am concerned with Palin is because it doesn't seem like it was very good judgment on McCain's part. Especially because he knew that people would pay closer attention to her because of his age. |`|c2uEs18eaa	Hope not... if he gets in! He can fade away like any other also-ran if not.    Canada isnt far enough to move Dude... trust me, if McCain is in, and dies, so you have Palin while we get a majority Conservative government up here... leave the continent!|`|NjybqXgRaa	He's very healthy and strong. I think it's ridiculous. His mom is still alive and well, and that says something. Besides he's not going to die his first day in office. However many years Palin gets to work and learn from him will only help her. The chances of him dying at all in offices are so slim to none. People just look for whatever excuses they can find to attack a candidate. And we can't discriminate against race, but it's ok to on age??   (also is is SO rare for someone to die of skin cancer, but he doesn't even have it anyway!)|`|DHNvyFe6aa	No, they just want another negative to say about McCain. He's so old, blah blah blah. His mom is still alive people!! Good genes. Anyways, it doesn't matter how old you are. You never know, Obama could die before McCain.|`|JK3iTms6aa	There is a high enough chance that it is worth consideration.    20% of Presidents did not finish out their terms of office.|`|2FfYuw7Laa	No, he exercises and eats healthy.    Plus, the presidents today have AMAZING, UNBELIEVABLE, STATE OF THE ART doctors.  They literally perform MIRACLES on presidents.    Think about it like this- the best doctors in the best country in the world.  In short... they are THE BEST surgeons and doctors and advisers in the world, all watching over him like a hawk.    If he had a heart attack, they would be hooking up an IED (defibrillator) in less than 5 seconds (literally) and have him in an operating room in no time.      Like I mean, I really can't even describe how good the doctors, nutritional planners, surgeons, etc. are for presidents in this day and age.  It's something thats simply UNAVAILABLE to the general public, how good they are.    So he would have to basically be assassinated or fall off a cliff or get in a car wreck for him to die (but we have the best drivers too!)    so NO- he isn't going to die.    ======================================...    Oh yeah.. Reagan was a beast, can't deny that.    I respect both McCain and Obama- but let's be freakin real.  This is the best damned country on earth.  Our doctors kick complete A*SS! They CAN and WILL protect both presidents.    It's not like in the 1800's, when abe lincoln was shot. back then they didnt even really have surgeons or nothin|`|4viZSTumaa	Yes, I absolutely believe he could die in the next 4 years. If he does not die, but his cancer does return, and he is forced to take treatment for it he will be incapacitated and unable to perform his duties, which will still fall back on Palin, who is under qualified for office in my personal opinion. Yes, I think more than ever, people should pay attention to BOTH vice presidential nominees. Especially seeing that,hate him or love him, Cheney was the first VP to fully exercise all the powers and rights of the President. And you can expect future VP's to do the same.
9eBruYtqaa	he has already told people that obama is a decent man and is not a terrorist. he said they just disagree on certain issues.|`|zEVpA4WCaa	 The real question is what will Obama do when he looses.will he move to the middle east had help his buddies with there agenda.|`|Svanlzg7aa	Get it right. He never said Obama was a terrorist, he said he associates with one. That would be Ayres the DOMESTIC TERRORIST. And if people don't think that is an important issue, hey would you invite Charlie Manson to your house for a sleepover if he promised NOT to kill you?|`|CQiPoco0aa	no...barry will prove him right|`|THNvhp3Caa	He will give a quaint concession speech, asking Americans to come together and work bi-partisanly to solve this great nation's problems.|`|Qtgrd4RPaa	After this election I'm hoping to never hear about Mccain and Palin ever again, they are some mean and nasty people....|`|AA10091004	He should be doing it now.|`|bwEVh8qmaa	No, anyway it'll be too late for that.  The damage is done.|`|DBu1AzjHaa	probably not.|`|AA12358300	he didn't have to, the truth will reveal in 2009!!  watch...|`|5Wc1vDshaa	McCain is in the twilight of his life. I hope America can let him retire in peace somewhere in the Florida Keys, with his memories of the VC and how he hurt his first wife.    He deserves that.|`|66865cd4d5e25998b341b212d292b6faaa	he has already been criticized for trying to tame his supporters.  |`|4GQrTt2Naa	He shouldn't have said that in the first place. I think he should make an apology to Obama soon.|`|Og5FUuuraa	No he will just sit on his a** in the senate and lick his wounds along with what remains of the republican party. After the election he won't have any supporters. The republicans will see that there are more elections coming up soon and realize that they need to distance themselves from Bush/McCain and start showing how they have been working with the new president. McCain will be lucky to get reelected.|`|52TraMM9aa	No i don't think he is that good of a person. |`|rYGV6yJeaa	No.  He will probably try to stop all progress in the Senate.|`|W2HoVVDCaa	If he loses he will probably sit back and smile at how an uninformed population that voted him in is going to be taught a big lesson.|`|luK6B4htaa	...Absolutely NOT... He's going to sit by his Mail Box like the rest of us and wait for our "Obama-Welfair" subsidy check(s)|`|19484598f9f84ec7472a4689fdbc1373aa	If he looses the election, Below will be my newest behavior to all Obama Voters...(The example here would be in a Restaurant setting)        Dear "Server"  We truly have enjoyed having dinner at this fine restaurant, and your service has been exemplary. However, we have been inspired by the words of Senator Barack Obama and have decided to "spread the wealth around."

c9a1f0964ec1c52f2b99f929391af5d7aa	I'm in the 80% of the population that opposes the whole scam.    If the companies that are being given corporate welfare were allowed to fail as they should be, their functions would be picked up by others who are a little more careful.    Bush's claim that the people of the country are on the verge of panic is pure unadulterated krap. Every time he cries "wolf" he seems to fool somebody. Kiss your money good-by, it isn't going to stay in the U.S.|`|fh12fkNWaa	Yes, with restrictions.  Why? For one thing I just heard this morning that our pension money is heavily invested in areas that will go under if they don't get a bail out. This is far reaching for thousands of retirees who depend on that money to live. For another, my parents lived through The Great Depression and people in the know say we'll have another one if they don't get a bail out. People don't realize that this doesn't just effect Wall Street. It will effect a bank near you.|`|ctcCPMdCaa	Anybody who supports this nonsense doesn't know how the Federal Reserve works.  This will require them to print even more money and devalue our currency even more, while we're left holding the bill for these f*ckers on Wall Street.|`|SfPx4BTLaa	I am not supporting it at all.|`|AA10719402	Because there's nothing like taking Ammodium AD when you are already constipated.      Same goes for financial markets.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I don't think anybody "supports" it. But the alternative is to risk a complete economic meltdown, one that might make the Great Depression look like a walk in the park. These companies never should have gotten so big, but they did, and they've pretty much painted us into a corner: Bail them out, or risk a massive economic collapse.|`|AA12358300	Bailout = Hand out for corporates    |`|xwQpeazUaa	Republican Socialism.. The way of the future.. Vote for McCain so it can continue.. |`|qY8ni6fKaa	Because if the bailout does not get passed we'll see morgate rates, along with many others, go up over 500%. Look what happened when Sweden went through the exact same about 10-20 years ago.|`|c6qpRqF5aa	I am not. McCain needs to man up and multitask.     McCain's deregulation policies are why we have this economic crisis. And in spite of claiming to be so concerned about solving it....he instead did an interview with Katie Couric and then flew to New York for a Clinton event. During that time Obama was on the phone with Bernanke and Paulson discussing the situation. McCain had NO discussions with the congressional committee which hammered out the deal. So how is he solving the crisis? Maybe he was asking Katie for her opinion - since he's already said he knows very little about the economy.  |`|V4tHXEB9aa	I am not.   They are seeking to give unlimited power to the Sec of the Treasury.   And they are seeking to make all financial institutions agents of the federal government, so Paulson will tell them what to do, and no one can question him.   that alone is enough to not support the bailout at all. |`|dxWf70Khaa	NO!!!!    Why should I bail someone out for making bad decisions. If these GIANT comapnaies fail, who cares? There are hundreds of smaller companies just waiting for the chance to take their place! This is how it works. By bailing out these large companies we have started down the road to Socialism. This will only make the rich richer and keep the little guy down.|`|7d7f46f15723f127d0e4111fac562a54aa	well, im not sure if its true, but if it IS true, then its possible that the whole economy of the USA will fall flat on its face.    Dont get me wrong, i hate the idea of sending those bastards $  BUT, i heard from too many sources that the house of cards can come tumbling down.  I also know its POSSIBLE, i have written about it a year ago.    http://godandall.blogspot.com/    Think of %50 of people being out of work, HOMELESS  think of every other home being VACANT  think of not enough $ for police + fire    it could be like the great depression but 10x worse.    The reason i think this is possible, is that there is a "TIPPING POINT"  in our economy where every thing starts to fall apart.    $10 a gallon gas would also do this      |`|MYjAhq4Paa	I don't like the idea that it came to this, and personally I would have rather the president had signed the home-owner's relief bill a few months ago, it probably would have been cheaper.

Owners were not able to pay back their loans ( Most of them subprime with hgher interest). If goverment can get those papers at low cost and sale it later with profit, most of the money could be recovered and tax payers may even make profit out of it.    Its kind of big investment on behalf of tax payers when there is no buyer in market, Goverment should take complete care in investing tax payer's money and should look for good bargain.|`|DJ4zkNSZaa	Does it really matter whether you support it or not?

Obama has mobilized a whole new generation of voters, and has united people around a new optimism for our country.     He doesn't want to divide the country into 'haves' and 'have-nots'. He wants the entire country to prosper.    He defends the middle class against the excesses of power.    The true patriot is an informed voter.|`|bJlSUVtNaa	I'm NOT!

No resume, no accomplishments, no experience, no original ideas, no understanding of how   the economy works, no understanding of how the world   works, nothing but abstract empty rhetoric devoid of real substance.     He has no real identity. He is half-white, which he   rejects. The rest of him is mostly Arab, which he   hides but is disclosed by his non-African Arabic   surname and his Arabic first and middle names as a way to triply proclaim his Arabic parentage to people in   Kenya . Only a small part of him is African Black from   his Luo grandmother, which he pretends he is exclusively.     What he isn't, not a genetic drop of, is 'Afr ican-American,' the descendant of enslaved Africans brought to America chained in slave ships. He hasn't a single ancestor who was a slave. Instead, his Arab ancestors were slave owners. Slave-trading was the main Arab business in East Africa for centuries until the British ended it.     Let that sink in: Obama is not the descendant of slaves, he is the descendant of slave owners. Thus he makes the perfect Liberal Messiah.     It's something Hillary doesn't understand - how some   complete neophyte came out of the blue and stole the   Dem nomination from her. Obamamania is beyond politics   and reason. It is a true religious cult, whose   adherents reject Christianity yet still believe in   Original Sin, transferring it from the evil of being   human to the evil of being white.     Thus Obama has become the whit e liberals' Christ,   offering absolution from the Sin of Being White. There   is no reason or logic behind it, no faults or flaws of   his can diminish it, no arguments Hillary could make   of any kind can be effective against it. The absurdity   of Hypocrisy Clothed In Human Flesh being their Savior   is all the more cause for liberals to worship him:   Credo quia absurdum, I believe it because it is absurd.     Thank heavens that the voting majority of Americans   remain Christian and are in no desperate need of a   phony savior.     His candidacy is ridiculous and should not be taken seriously
QIPuSe8zaa	I agree with you on most of these matters.  Why should a homeowner who qualified and paid on time have to bail out someone who A) never was qualified to buy B) got a teaser 2 year rate so that they could make the payments and now are in default because their house didn't increase 20% per year.  The hope of the rescue bill is that since most if not all of these loans have been written down to market by the banks or investment groups that own them, that when the housing market comes back to normality, then the loans and / or property can be resold at a value that yield more than the valuation.  This is very likely to play out this way.  The Congress and the idiot (okay that's an insult to idiot's) speaker sold this as a Wall Street Bailout, when in fact the true bailout is to small business and to allow the credit markets to keep the daily activity (buying, selling, payroll, etc.) liquid.  All business has to borrow money and this current stalemate is a freeze on the good and the bad lending and has to stop quickly.|`|7o3DMzXQaa	you must be perfect and never make mistakes|`|AA12358300	I couldn't agree you more....    |`|AA11222327	It ends when the rich are rich again and we are paying for it, as usual. |`|sXnoIFRsaa	It does not end plain and simple we live in a free and democratic society and this allows the people to choose as they feel.

They created this mess with their excessive greed and overindulged lives. When is enough enough? We are already paying. I saw something that said for every house that is empty or has been foreclosed, your equity in your house goes down 3%. I believe that is correct. I have one in my neighborhood. I believe that it's happened twice in the past year or so.   Have you thought about putting your house up for sale? Houses don't seem to be selling in our city but where my parents are, houses are selling. They are in a very desirable town. My husband and I want to move there but can't afford it.     If you are responsible then you get stuck with the losing end. It feels good though to be responsible and to try to do the right thing. I wouldn't change. Society is dysfunctional. It's not us.     edit: It's a mess. I hope it works out. But we are so far gone. We have to change our track. We have a perfect opportunity to turn things around. I believe that.

However, the larger picture is much more bleak. We are reaching an extremely high unemployment rate. The government is bankrupt and is running out of unemployment benefits. If McCain gets elected, it will be a continuation of Bush, failed policy. People have already cut back on there spending, buying only the essentials and things are getting worse -not better. There will be no one buying your goods or products, small businesses can not compete with larger business. Supply and demand can drop prices where there is too much supply and no demand.  I am employed but I have cut back on my spending to the bare necessities, food and gas, that's it.   McCain wants more war and plans to cut back on every program in order to fund his wars.

Perhaps you should speak with your accountant.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	I think you should be talking to an accountant.    I am sure someone will correct this, but normally you are taxed on PROFIT, not on gross income.  The same applies to your personal income.. ie, it is TAXABLE income that counts.    If McCain's plan is taxing insurance benefits.. that would harm you. I don't think that is true of the Dem.  Obama also mentions tax incentives for hiring new employees.   This assumes that you are seriously asking and not trying to plant something just for dispute reasons. |`|VBHOiIBlaa	Join the club ....

I can barely tell them apart.|`|Sicr0Mdoaa	McCain's experience of acting a lot of Bush.|`|bBRsQaRWaa	Obamas lack of experience.  With any job experience is key!  Palin has more experience than Obama!|`|bJlSUVtNaa	I'll take McCain over Obama ANYDAY! Just ask yourself, can you trust Obama with this country...... I don't think so :)|`|AA12358300	Lack of Experience..    Besides, McCain has a backup of lack of experience (Palin) which is  the same as Obama.    which makes McCain team more qualified.|`|c4a12b4159512248edfdbea403dcfa2eaa	Well first, Obama has a vast amount of experience so that cancels itself out and if you judge how the current economy is then you may be able to answer your own question.|`|PIuuvfPHaa	Obama has been in government since the 90s. He doesn't lack experience.
5bYpbodUaa	I thought that was very interesting myself. I had to take a second look to make sure my eyes weren't deceiving me.  It's the first time I've seen it. He's trying to pull the wool over a lot of ppl's eyes....but there's no wool over mine because I'm on to you OBAMA! or I should say, NOBAMA!|`|jCh5OqJqaa	I think he is, but McCain isn't.  LOL|`|dc74f01683320f5b2ee1f13ea7dd03f3aa	Ya,    I find it interesting that McCain isn't wearing one.|`|eJS9znWdaa	looks like it|`|9480b47d53181b325473487c60b671daaa	He does say the pledge - that is just  a internet smear tactic. He started wearing a flag pin after a veteran gave him  one at a rally.    Where is McCain's flag pin? |`|rlDZbMpQaa	funny...i was at a rally and he pledged just fine. imagine that.....|`|8M36dNvxaa	Who cares? Stop obsessing with flags, pins, and other stupid symbols....symbols are for the simple-minded.    Pay attention to the politician's policies and values, not if he salutes a flag or wears a pin....|`|LzHZrUc9aa	shut up man. Dont you think this country has more important issues that a damn flag pin. No wonder you supported Bush twice. People like to vote for people on their level of intelligence.|`|oMCeeh8Iaa	The debate for tonight just ended a min ago and I noticed he was wearing one. McCain forgot to wear one tonight. It's not that important, I mean McCain couldn't be any more of a patriotic person.|`|AqZvhJMJaa	But Barack Obama DOES actually say the pledge.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIyBwkuqF...
igYxuCIKaa	No, I don't think he'll bring it up, but I think the moderator will.  Then, McCain will have to talk about it.|`|b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	With both candidates having so many skeletons in their cupboards i feel sorry for America . For we have an fool as our leader already and we know how it feels to have a brain dead  idiot  at the helm. (And before you say , i didn't vote for him ) in fact nobody voted for him he took over by default. AND WE ARE STUCK WITH HIM.|`|TvD9BIGRaa	Whatever.|`|UYmRjCY9aa	the whole Bush family was actively involved via the oil deals with many in the middle east royal families. and i can't see that McCain would be a whole lot different. |`|04c6f0020d54d895d5df2d20e39d5fb7aa	he said it himself that he plans to. but if he knows whats good for him, he wont. you see where its gotten him so far right? nowhere.|`|5kNd3LpXaa	He should    I would bring up that and Rev Wright    Judgement is an important quality for a President and these two people are examples of poor judgement on Obamas part|`|YHPYg7pWaa	I doubt it!But there again!Everything is fair in love and war and especially politics!|`|AA12358300	And guess what I bet Obama will bring up Jesus ...    like many liberals would suggest him to...    then all of a sudden his christian faith comes back.. but not "pro life, or anti gay..."|`|zE9MnUZLaa	I think he should and he should also bring up Rev Wright.|`|rCugrc5xaa	Yes, He's really getting that desperate.|`|0ZuHXUwFaa	Meeting some one is not the same as being friends with one, Now if you said McCain was friends with these men and believed in them,you would be saying some thing, Obama is friends with Ayers thinks like him, Would you say their is a difference|`|N6qTcSJbaa	To not talk about what he and Palin have been talking about for the last 3 weeks would be entirely idiotic.  Bring it up McCain!  Talk about the real issues, the real issues being how we cannot trust this man to lead our country.  Not with all the questions about him and his personal life and people he surrounds himself with.|`|Ujc7r539aa	I think Obama should bring up Sarah Palin's connection to the AIP and why he really picked her for V.P. I went to the Alaskan Independence Party web site. i read the info. Why would Palin who sounds so patriotic and for AMERICA be linked with a party which is openly ANTI- AMERICAN. Openly helped her get her Governors seat, Husband openly was a member, and she openly thanked the AIP and looked forward to working with them. One striking thing i read was how once alaska is separated from America through pushing as many as they can to the white house for their agenda , that the OIL will be a means to secure their financial stability. Now i think Is this why McCain picked this virtual unknown Palin. To drill baby drill and keep Washington's hand in Alaska's OIL MONEY POT. Wow America we better wake up and see whats really behind the red lipstick.|`|yz2u9yVYaa	No, John McCain will NOT bring up Bill Ayers or Rev. Wright for that matter. McCain is too polite and politically-correct. He should take a page from Sarah Palin and rip Obama a new one. God knows McCain has enough ammunition! |`|jXj2bj6Waa	Yes, he needs to bring it up so Obama can have the chance to clear himself once and for all.|`|4f79340641baff06271767646a480530aa	You need to give a source .    McCain should bring it up and he should also bring up the fact that retired Former FBI agents are Outraged at Obama-Ayers Ties.   My source     http://www.newsmax.com/kessler/fbi_obama...|`|lzVRCMh8aa	yes he's scrambling to keep his head above water. think it will get ugly tonight. can't stand the negativety (sp). things are 
vRY2vExRaa	He'll be the voice on her ear bud.|`|BC1VXQjWaa	and he will talk about THE SURGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|gSdSRceRaa	Hardly ! Palin can handle herself fine.  They just have to take off the reins and let her be herself. |`|sW6lxVFOaa	They will wire her like they wired Bush. I just realized something, Bush is smarter than Palin - he was able to give interviews without daddy Bush helping out.|`|1469c060bcbe727c457ec792ff3dc9b1aa	yes he will be there I think when he step in to answer for her that was sexiest I hate when a man has to answer for me I want him to answer to me|`|MDH6WRCjaa	I bet he wants to. "Daddy comes in to save the day!".|`|53MiP9bEaa	I think he is going to have a radio transmitter implanted in her neck so he can tell her the answers.|`|uiiebnjDaa	Yes he will be the one under her skirt hehe she likes him to be right up there!!!|`|7ab804564e5429f8f8edb4b7eb6c23c6aa	Probley, he follows her everywhere because shes the only thing that is keeping him in the elections.|`|iYDEEOE4aa	Please put down the pipe!|`|bb16e0fee5dbb1a2424144b4283cf549aa	Well, if he did, his campaign would essentially be over and he can make his concession speech when the debate finished.  (It was pretty weird for him to do that with Couric...made me think of "take your daughter to work" Day.)|`|3gd8jGSLaa	I think he will.    Obama is going to show that he trusts his VP and he'll stay away. McBush, on the other hand, will sit in the audience or on the sidelines for what he will call "moral support" but will look to us more like "daddy".|`|LzHZrUc9aa	No need. All McCain has to do is press play. Palin already comes preset with 5 responses.    1. "I am honored to have John McCain as my running mate"  2. " I can see Russia from the great state of Alaska"  3. "Thanks but no thanks"   4. "Whats the difference between a pig and me? Lipstick"  5. "Only one man in this race has actually fought for this country, and thats John McCain!"|`|bd199b145abcebe8cf6b3d8d6ce14b78aa	mcpain will be there for support most likely, because off in the side lines cindy and first dude will be some where snorting cocaine|`|PkK0VuI8aa	I bet. He will probably be right under her dress.....well, maybe not there but close.
c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	No, if he is invited for a visit, he will need to follow the rules.    Dustin, good point!|`|O95pKlPiaa	Didn't Clinton smoke cigars?|`|l2kD6XQ8aa	Obama quit smoking a long time ago.|`|vuWEpjnaaa	Sure, why not? If the Prez can start a trillion dollar war they can surely smoke.     Besides, if smoking was ok with Franklin Roosevelt it's ok with me|`|G99UDprmaa	He is going to put in a bar, to have happy hour..  And a dance floor to do the electric slide.  It's ok you can come in to party..with the "First D.J." spinning on the ones & twos..|`|AA11963685	Since Presidents have been smoking in the White House since this country has been born, this question is an interesting one. Presidents have smoked both cigarettes and cigars on a regular basis. I do know that politicians in DC were upset about a smoking ban that forbade them from smoking their beloved cigars in bars and restaurants while they had a drink and politicked.  I saw a piece on that earlier this year in Time.  If he smokes, he will likely do it outside on the Oval Office patio.  Just like my husband does at home.  Goes outside to the patio for a nice sit down with a newspaper and a cigar after dinner.|`|66865cd4d5e25998b341b212d292b6faaa	no, i doubt it.|`|QWLNBtUeaa	I should imagine that the Whitehouse is a 100% smoke free environment.  Obama will be the next President. If he hasn't stopped smoking yet he should strongly consider it.    The Whitehouse is the property of the American people, not any President who lives there.|`|AA12358300	Still not allowed to smoke, it will make it dirty.. but...    Maybe he will paint the white house..........      If you thumb me down because of the word paint.. you have a racist thought!!    paint does not mean change of color!!!  it can be repaint!|`|lklwmGh6aa	Maybe in his own room, but I doubt he can in the Oval office, he will have to go outside, or quit.  |`|Z92LPUqaaa	He quit smoking, but if he starts back up he probably would have a smoking area.|`|da0463b5125f03d85527fe970a64f901aa	I dunno, but I often see those congressmen and such with their big fat cigars, so maybe. I mean, the laws don't apply to them anyhow right?|`|riAlt51Naa	no, he can't ,but he can start wars for oil, corruption, and 11 billion debt from there|`|0RXSCb41aa	If it goes my way he wont be able to walk in the front door!  Go McCain! Country First!|`|HYg6C5Pwaa	He'll never see the inside, much less be able to have a smoke inside with the president! lmfao!!!|`|ME6iuKvaaa	Secret Service agents have been purchasing cocaine for Obama's use, because they feel it is a security risk for him to be entering the neighborhoods where he would have to make the purchases himself.  If elected, they will presumably continue doing this for him at the White House.  |`|0GJQQTVAaa	It's "DRILL BABY DRILL" not "PUFF BABY PUFF".|`|KuJcQbyeaa	Obama did quit smoking recently, at the insistance of his wife. As for DC being a smoke free city; you've clearly never been there, because lots of people smoke. It's just a city that happens to house the government. I do believe that the white house is smoke free, but the rose garden is not, so if a president did smoke, it wouldn't be too hard.

I think it is a hoax just like this economic crisis...it is a way for Bush & his buddies to dip into money & steal it...the war is a way they have made a fortune by using fear to get people to say yes so they can rob the country..republicans blame democrats but republicans need to wake up & see that our country has been destroyed because the 95% of us have been at war with this greedy 5% & they have won thanks to the republicans voting for it & they blame congress but congress does what we tell them to do.|`|418d2e9812dceb72c6c1d038184e789baa	Illegal immigration. Illegal immigration negatively impacts the economy, healthcare, education, etc..

I am opposed to the big bail out.  If we have a whopper of a recession,  the illegals will be hit first and the hardest and they will have to go home.   Then it would be a good time to build the fence to keep them out.   The recession would also help with the balance of trade as people would stop buying stuff they really do not need from China.   It would also remind people they need to take care of themselves and not expect the government to bail them out.  |`|CotRk7rjaa	War, and protecting us from terrorists interests me the most.

She is way over her head. |`|zWj5wcsdaa	Palin, hands down. Palin is bush with brains, which is a scary thought. She is not nearly as stupid as she has come across in some of her interviews. She is naive of national politics, but her supporters do not care. They are voting for her no matter what an idiot she comes across as being because they believe she is pro-church, anti-gay marriage, and anti-abortion. The anti-environmentalists will vote for her because she supports raping and pillaging the environment. She is a puppet that can and will be easily used by the republican party and special interest groups. The bad thing is, she has enough intelligence to allow herself to be used and to pursue her own interests at the same time. The woman is dangerous to our individual rights and to our environment.|`|84fd7e4798193628f44c8efd477cee2caa	neither one has much sense,but I am leaning toward,plain's moose|`|Cw5TRP02aa	This is a tough one... although I have to say Bush, only because he attended Yale... they don't accept "average" intelligence, and I'm almost certain Palin wouldn't be accepted into Yale.|`|AA11453631	Barrack Obama\Joe Biden.|`|Acjg6qF0aa	Pallin is an idiot, Bush hands down.

I think he could have chosen to bring up things like the Couric and Gibson interviews.  He could have gotten into the separation of church and state issue.  He could have gotten into any of the numerous scandals and legal problems she's had or he could have talked about the Matanuska Maid Dairy bankruptcy.  He let all of her issues disappear and focused on the facts and John McCain's legacy.|`|ohzPenCWaa	Without a doubt. She made a lot of mistakes that he could've chewed her up on, but he knew it would come out the next day, so why bother.|`|yoKHoKXjaa	I think that he toned down his emotions a bit.  |`|dfo8gSaraa	Yes.  He pretty much had to.  Everyone coddled her...Biden, Gwen Ifill, etc.  If they hadn't the shyt woulda hit the fan!!    I will say that the tone of the debate was not as tense as the Obama/McCain debate.|`|OFA2LAM5aa	Yes he did, but the strategy worked.  He attacked McCain's policies rather than Palin.  All polls show that he won the debate handily.    |`|E1gKL2fSaa	I think he was on his heals trying to explain all the comments he made about Obama before he ended up being his running mate.|`|rLc1QeVbaa	yep, and he still won.  |`|2Y08aslJaa	McCain/Palin 2008|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	Absolutely! He had no choice, he could have eclipsed her completely but he didn't to save his female voters and also to avoid the Republicans to call him a women basher. |`|4aF6xRSUaa	I think he had to make sure he didn't come across in a way that Palin freaks would later twist into an accusation of "sexism"|`|2lVmLpUhaa	yes. it was a joke for him|`|5DaoEoFzaa	no.....why would he..|`|5cLZlX30aa	Don't you think that would be bad for the Obama campaign if he did "go easy" on her?  Why would he purposefully try to make his opponent look better than him?  No, he would want to crush her the best he could.  Joe Biden is a very intelligent man.  I think that if you support him, then you really should give him more credit than that!    It would be FABULOUS if you all would stop making up excuses for how great she did last night.  It's getting soooo old!|`|C4EGYiazaa	No, she caught him in several lies, and he tried to deny it.|`|SLfmBjkOaa	Yes, he did. He was afraid of being too condescending so he took it easy. He still did a good job, though.....|`|cUVoBiEkaa	He could have been tougher & Palin could have bee too.|`|uQlr6jUhaa	Yes... because otherwise he would have ben accused of being sexist. He was in a tough spot.|`|Q3TGJMdkaa	Too easy...he made the mistake of trying to make sense, and should have tried to BS about absolutely nothing and give "shoutouts" in his answers. Talking about nothing and giving shoutouts, isn't that something rap artists do?|`|DVYEawNmaa	Treated her with kid gloves but still easily won. He could of probably made her cry if he really went at her.|`|Ue2u4q6Saa	Yes, there are plenty of times Biden could have went at her with tough rhetoric and questions, but he held back. Obama does the same thing with McCain. I think the Dems don't want to be the dividers they want to be Uniters.|`|RKCUwSBNaa	Yep, but he gave McSame hell! LOL|`|awHjcdIYaa	she gave as good as she got....|`|VPH2ODIEaa	Most definitley, there were times where you could almost see that he wanted to put her in her place, but when he did, it was politely and he even asked permission the first time to correct her!|`|AA12358300	no, he couldn't even look at the camera most of the times, he might be feeling uncomfortable at all yesterday|`|AA12338452	No.    I would say Biden focused on the more important decision, which is McCain or Obama.    Almost no one bases their vote for President by who the Vice Presidential nominee is.  Biden did what a VP candidate is supposed to do.  |`|4HlB7UkVaa	He and Obama enjoy the luxury of having the media do their dirty work as we all know the NY Times and MSNBC are wellsprings of unbiased truth|`|iHIEp8Fzaa	 Yes, after all she is the symbol of American motherhood. It wouldn't serve his purpose to make her look bad or confused. They are probably very close when not in front of the camera. The whole thing was scripted anyway!  PEACE!|`|8d03861730f026c4ad3cdc103920d37daa	Yes! everyone is going easy on her now. Afraid their going to be criticized for making her open her mouth.|`|FsTLFte2aa	no

But, tell you what, I am sick of the all the personal attacks, misinformation, and the tired media interjections into this campaign.  Can't wait till the election is over.|`|GgsR4Dlsaa	yes.  Obama's voice has made me vomit on 2 occasions.|`|ukFfdizOaa	never been more pleased; as long as my guy wins|`|XTopfG8Taa	Yes, we have a choice between two socialist and neither one represents the people.|`|RPp3WVOnaa	Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We need election reform.  How about nominating several candidates so we have more of a choice.  Nothing like going down a cereal aisle and only having two different cereals to choose from like "grape nuts" and "fruit loops" :)|`|1tN8GoO0aa	only the wrinkled guy with the fat left jaw|`|DqOBJE86aa	Yes, they both suck. Is there any way that we can pick another candidate to run?|`|JsA1EjVEaa	No.  I am sick to my stomach from this whole election year and all the lies that the supporters keep perpetuating.|`|f22024ccc8d47490798933fe353a5617aa	 Yeah. Sure am, and it's pretty much dj vu with this election. First, the sickening feeling I had looking at John Kerry on stage and  hearing  the libs praise that clown. And now, the same sick feeling, listening to the libs do it all over again with this indonesian quasi-american John Kerry clone.
A3UaBkzRaa	Obama  1)McCain is being painted as a hero when in reality he turned on the country as a POW.  2)McCain has openly stated that he is not sure how many houses he owns (which means he can't relate to normal people who are not millionaires.)  3)I like his views on health care... I don't necessarily see what's wrong with socialized medicine, as Europe and other places that have it, at least have HEALTH CARE.  4)McCain openly stated that he had no respect for his superiors in Vietnam (not during this election, but it has been stated) and was disciplined many times in his Navy career.  5)I believe McCain may have dementia.|`|qDsrQIhIaa	McCain  1. Lower taxes. not robbing money from hard working people and giving it to lazy Hippies who do nothing but drugs.    2.Ending the Iraq war the right way. by defeating the terrorists and not surrendering like the obama wants to do.    3.

He fought hard against the corruption at Fannie and Freddie and against legislation that forced banks to make sub-prime loans.    He talks with honesty about his past and his vision for the future.    Obama, by contrast, has a record of voting his pocket and his political asspirations. Obama was also in favor of the sub-prime loans and ignored the corruptions that led to this current economic crisis. And finally, Obama is a huge fan of Saul Alinsky and uses his political tactics to fool the American people|`|QYl0BWv1aa	HERE ARE MY TWO SIDES OF THE COIN    I would vote for Obama because I think it would be a good thing for race relations.      I would vote for Obama because I think he is a great speaker and would be a good image for America and the world.    I would vote for Obama because I like Oprah, and I would like to see her happy.   I believe African Americans have been discriminated against and I think it would make them feel validated and it would be extremely healing, wonderful for their self image.     BUT  I WILL vote for McCain because after much investigation I have found Obama to be a deceitful, self absorbed liar.    I WILL vote for McCain because Obama tries too hard to hide his past and minimizes his associations with dangerous people- which frightens me.  I believe his views are not centrist or transcending class, but very radical and far left, which again, he hides.    I WILL vote for McCain because even if you think he is a war monger, he has military experience and has been able to and does discern when he thinks war is necessary and when it is not.  Having been a prisoner of war I think he would add a little rational sense to this that few others could have.     I WILL vote for McCain because I am middle class and already pay too much in taxes (it is our money not the governments) for social programs that I have worked in that I know don't work and are a huge waste of money.    I WILL vote for McCAIN because I don't believe that my taxes won't go up with all of the social(ist) programs Barak is suggesting.    I WILL vote for McCAIN because I believe if anyone does, he will be the one less likely to give my money to support illegal aliens and their children.    I WILL vote for McCAin because despite my HUGE disappointment in him (and Obama) for voting yes on the bailout, I believe he has been and will be a better steward of my tax dollars, not squandering them away as Obama did in his only executive experience, the Chicago Annenberg Challenge.|`|9rSEdOr4aa	Voting is one of the greatest powers any citizen can hold; in our own past certain people (women, ethnic minorities, etc.) have been denied this right because it was believed that these people werent intelligent or capable. Today we have this right, and this election will probably be the most important election we have ever taken part in. It is important that we take advantage of this right because the power is in our hands.

DdozhVC2aa	I'm looking into the USAF Reserve and the Air National Guard right now.  To become a paralegal for either you must first attend Basic Military Training (BMT), then your "tech school", which is training to become a paralegal in our case.      In the USAF, BMT is 6.5 weeks long if you go before 1 November, 2008 and is 8.5 weeks if you go after that.  The school for a paralegal is about 6-7 weeks long.       While in BMT, you will not be able to speak on the phone or anything....after you get to school, you can have visitors and everything so you'll have contact with the outside world.       If you can deal with the BMT, you'll be good to go after that!     With a bachelors, you should look into being an officer instead of an enlisted member.  More money, more respect, etc.     Good luck!!!|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Only the Army offers E-4 as advanced enlistment rank for those with 4 year college degrees.    The AF and Navy offer E-3, the Marines and Coast Guard offer E-2.    .........................................    Paralegal is an enlisted job,     There are no Officer paralegals.    .........................................    You just enlist with para legal as your mos/afsc or rate.    But note: being a military para legal, is not the same as a civilian para legal.    Just attending the para legal ait/tech school - will not make you a certified para legal.    To be a certified para legal    You have to attend the advanced para legal training course  Which is only offered to E-5 and above.    You have to have finish your two year associates in para legal.    And you have to finish your skill training for E-5    IE: for the Air Force, you must finsh your 7 level training.    After all that, you will be certified.    .........................................    Basicly, it would take a 6 year enlistment, to be a certified para legal after one enlistment.    .........................................    All enlisted attend basic training.

LosgQIcGaa	Si'.    Ci sar anche un altro effetto.    Lo stipendio plafonario (quello fisso) diminuir continuamente per essere "compensato" dagli straordinari.    Questo alletter i dipendenti a firmare nuovi contratti perch il datore di lavoro dir "invece di fare 40 ore a settimana a 500 euro fammene 20 a 250 e poi le altre 20 di straordinario a 500".  Ovviamente, non appena le parti "fisse" del contratto saranno sufficientemente basse ci saranno straordinari solo per chi  disposto a farne 20 ore facendosene segnare 10.    E' infatti piuttosto risaputo che gli elementi flessibili dei contratti sono difficilissimi da controllare e ben si prestano all'evasione.    Insomma... meno assunzioni e maggiori strumenti ricattatorii in mano ai datori di lavoro.    Un invito: non ragionate sulla base di quello che dicono e fanno le imprese ORA. Pensate a come saranno i contratti con la nuova legge.  Pensare con le metodologie attuali agli effetti delle leggi future  gi stato fatto con la legge "Biagi", dovremmo avere imparato qualcosa nel mentre.|`|8a26ad287931a5caade1111abaaec20baa	la detassazione degli straordinari  applicabile ad una ristratta cerchia di lavoratori |`|Fi9j2OcMaa	La detassazione  degli staordinari  stato uno di quei provvedimenti che non hanno spostato di una virgola l'economia delle famiglie perch:  Non  detto che ci siano straordinare di fare  Al lavoratore non sempre interessa fare straordinari  Nell'ambito di una stessa azienda lo straordinario non lo si pu proporre a tutti indistintamente.  Nelle aziende del sud manca proprio il lavoro figuriamoci se si pu parlare di straordinari.  In generale gli indici di produzione sono in flessione per cui l'esigenza di straordinari in questo periodo  veramente raro.  Le lavoratrici di norma non fanno straordinari per loro esigenze familiari.  Quando l'efficacia di un provvedimento  talmente ridotto non lo si pu far passare come un beneficio che aiuter l'economia delle famiglie ma si riduce invece ad una presa in giro.|`|0mxOFZwBaa	non  che  discriminata, semplicemente avr lo stipendio normale, al massimo il marito potr prendere ANCHE gli straordinari se lo vorr, cio cosa c' di male?

YaF5b6cIaa	For some people college is a big adjustment at first.  Youre living a much more independent life.  You have to keep up with where youre supposed to be, and when, and get there on time with what you need.  No one will ride your back if you skip class, or stand over you to see that your work gets done.  Most schools want you to live in a dorm your first year at least, so you dont have ALL the hassles of keeping a household going, and you can (try to) eat in the cafeteria.  Time management and self-discipline are crucial to success in the classroom.    I went to the University of North Carolina, which at that time at least had both Navy and Air Force ROTC.  At one point I lived in a big house off campus and had a roomie that was AFROTC, and he seemed very happy with it and motivated.  All the guys I knew who were doing it seemed to have a lot on the ball.  You dont have to decide anything right away, and Id continue to mull it over.  It seems its been your dream for a long time, and if you still feel that way by the time youre a senior, why not?  There's much worse things to do with your college opportunities.  Best of luck to you.|`|imtw3gNwaa	College isn't scary... what I do find scary, however, are people who join the Military, either Enlisted, or Commissioned, for the money, or a free education... the main reason to join should be to Serve your Country, not as a way to "live the good life"  Financial success can be achieved in many ways, but accepting a Commission is about much more than that, and in reality, is a slower way to achieve that...  join for the Right reasons, not for money, college, or any other "material" gain... you are young, you have time to consider your Motivations, and while doing that, continue to do your best in JROTC, even if you decide tio choose another path in Life, what you learn now, will only enhance you in the future.  Good luck.    EDIT: I never said YOU, I said it was one thing I find scary...  I was not rude, nor condescending, however, your reply was. Therefore, I am glad you aren't considering the Corps.

Same thing with McCain had some effect of reason why the economic is the way it is now And we don't want a president that's gonna give us the same as he did as a Senate and besides he's scared lol|`|4r4kS8EAaa	He will lose. If he can't handle a debate and give his ideas in Washington what makes people think he can handle the presidency. There's a war that's going on and a very bad economy that's far worse than a debate and the economy I think.|`|LE3rDHP9aa	He'll loose in November.|`|NcwhoXSwaa	Get in touch with Chicken Little and ask him if the sky is falling.|`|ECGxtgKMaa	Obama will look like a jackass for caring more about a debate than the Economic status of the US.|`|EGpDq57kaa	The media blasts Mccain (that would be new lol)    nobama will stand by himself and act like the fool that he is.|`|5rQ9jomhaa	We'll laugh less in the weekend|`|3NKOVaNhaa	Incarcerated Bert's comment literally had me rolling on the floor!
QzWHMGHJaa	I think we need new fresh ideas and you won't get that from a 72 year old man!  He is old and has old ideas and America needs to stop making the same mistakes over and over.  I respect McCain and appreciate what he did for our country, but I feel we have a better chance of making better choices for our country with Obama!  I also worry about his age and if he dies we have a totally inexperienced woman as president?  She's a bit to over confident if you ask me!  At least Obama will have a vice president with lots of experience and if Obama died (which I doubt he will), Biden would make a better president than Palin.|`|AA12358300	no.. both are the same...    Too bad, we don't have a parallel world.  We have no idea what the other can do or how it turns out..    No such thing as "if"... whatever will be will be...|`|DHNvyFe6aa	With McCain it will get better. With Obama he will just sit back and let everything crumble, "Call me when you need me"!|`|AA11450062	I think that it will tank anyway only if they sign the bill now it won`t tank until after the election. McCain and all his experience did nothing to stop Bush and Reagan for that matter.|`|VRgq1NV6aa	it's gonna suck no matter what.    But, I believe that under an Obama presidency we could go some distance to repairing the damage that deregulation and greed have caused.    Under McCain - who supports the very concepts that have gotten us in this mess - things will just deteriorate further|`|6iRrlATraa	No matter who wins, our economy will suffer. It is what it is and there is plenty of blame to go around on both sides of the isle.|`|GxKClSPLaa	With our economy the way it is now  we all are going to suffer for a long time.  But in My opinion as much as I've heard against Oboma I a  m goning to vote for a man that has served his country  not took from it .  Oboma is  taking everything Martin L King has work for and turned this into a race war !|`|pm6h7YNPaa	yes I do think it will suffer. Republicans hold the view that letting the economy/market sort itself out is usually the best way to go. Bush finally accepted the fact that for the current market crisis, this sort of hands off approach will not work.    Obama is only proposing raising taxes on people who make 250,000 and over. That will not change anything for the general American public. So stop the taxes whining, and even if you are in that category its better than dealing with a man who doesnt know how to use the computer, much less should be president of the United States!    Dont even get me started on Palin, that woman terrifies me.     |`|5rL4njnxaa	McCain has been squarely in favor of deregulation.  Many feel that was a major cause of the problem.  He now says we need to re-regulate.    He has major advisers who profited from the problem and will profit again with the bail out.    He has admitted knowing little about the economy.  His senior adviser, Phil Grahm was a major proponent of the policies that got us into this mess.    He seemed to be the last person in the country to know there was even a problem.    |`|Eve7v3acaa	No; it will get WAY better.|`|NmfwqQf5aa	No I do not, but Obama will raise your taxes.|`|UBdLtCleaa	I hope not.|`|EoCS4Yxxaa	McCain will be Horrible and God Obama will bring the light from SouthSide of Chicago and will bright up America....HAHAHAHAHA|`|nwRo5N1maa	The Dem's just spent $700 Billion so who cares|`|brsIHYKkaa	he wants to start a "commision" to spend more money, investagating OUR economy.

I think it will stay as it is! But if Obama is elected, it will also stay the same! It took a long time for it to plummit as it has and it will take a long time to fix it!    McCain and Obama are going to get bad reviews about this, just as Bush did when we went to war with Iraq! They are all coming into office just as things go bad. |`|df2834e145b04f334a5c5b5ae4fc722faa	If you're a millionaire, you will be better off under McCain.   http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/...|`|jNOQPPTpaa	I don't know about the economy, but healthcare and women's rights definitely will!  If you vote McCain, get ready to give up the rights to your own body!|`|ARbDKdH6aa	Yeah absolutely, McCain will raises your taxes  and Obama won't raises your taxes,   only people who has more than 250 Thousands dollars that will raise taxes.    McCain doesn't understand the economy and Sarah has no intellectual on Economy.  How can they handle themself? it will go WORST!     Obama - Economy.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM6zILb_F...|`|NUGErTlzaa	Yes.  He plans on taking the exact direction as the current presidency.  We are glooming ever so closely to a financial breakdown.  Changes need to be made.    |`|RFR03Xswaa	McCain is the way to go. |`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Won't suffer.  Obama's anti-business policies will contribute to higher unemployment.  |`|EZ5mwUF3aa	If McCain wins, you better start learning how to speak Russian.|`|SS1VReF0aa	Do you feel that if McCain wins the election, the economy will suffer?  Or, do you feel that if Obama wins that we will be better off?    Do I have to pick between the two options? Because they are saying the same thing...    McCain will do better for the economy than Obama.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	Yes, I do. It is failing now with a Republican in office, why would it change? My greatest fear would be that he dies while in office, Palin becomes our President and she has no real experience to guide her decisions. I think it could be a real serious disaster, real quick.    From the perspective that Obama is a Democrat, Like Clinton was and things were so prosperous during that time I would be much more comfortable to make  the change!    To the comment below...Do You REALLY think that's his plan? Honestly, that makes no sense. None of this politicking has made sense in 8 years so what do I know?!?|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	I think we will be much worse off economically if Obama is elected.  His programs and projects all require expanded financing and the only way to get that financing will be through taxing.  People claim he will increase taxes on the wealthy, but you need to THINK just a minute.  The people his supporters claim will face increased taxes are Obama and his cohorts and his financiers. Do you really, honestly think that will happen?  Not in a thousand years.  Also, his plan to tax "dirty" energy...natural gas, coal, and oil...will result in higher prices to the consumer, including electricity and home heating.  His plan for additional taxes on business will put many small employers out of business and their employees out of a job.  Additional taxes on big business will send business flocking overseas and closing production in the U.S..  You need, at this late date, to get on the internet and do your own research.  Just start typing questions and key phrases into Google and see what you find.  Then make your own decision.
LzHZrUc9aa	Very possible but i'll say Warren G Harding still claims the top spot.    Warren G. Harding's claim to infamy rests on spectacular ineptitude captured in his own pathetic words: "I am not fit for this office and should never have been here." Once in the White House, the 29th president busied himself with golf, poker, and his mistress, while appointees and cronies plundered the U.S. government in a variety of creative ways. "I have no trouble with my enemies," Harding once said, adding that it was his friends who "keep me walking the floor nights."

I thought nobody could top Nixon or Regan but you may have a point since Bush managed to combine the worst of both.|`|IeRO44RWaa	Yes. All of the other horrible presidents have just done nothing... Bush is actively ruining the world.|`|1EVBiYgSaa	People who say this is the worst economic crisis ever, are too young to know what the great depression was like, or don't want to admit it.    But, like the current crisis, the depression of the thirties was not caused by the President. The President always gets blamed, but for one person in the oval office, there are (presently) 500 congress persons, all of whom have a hand in everything the President does- and they get it first.    Nancy Pelosi, and her liberals in the House, and Harry Reed, and his liberals in the Senate are all responsible- IOW, liberals are more responsible for the current crisis than conservatives.    About 9/11, Clinton knew it was coming as far back as '93, but was too busy chasing women, at least one of which was young enough to be his granddaughter.    So, while you are laying blame, there's plenty to go around.    Yes, this Presidency is bad, FDR's was far worse.|`|AA11570691	Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes!!!

They have the best pilots, training, and all the money to make this so. No other country can touch us the reason I say that is this fact ( We can deploy a mass number of troops, equipment, and supplies any where in the world within 24 hours and no other country can come close to doing this). Along with the Air Force comes the army and along with the Navy comes the Marines so yes the way our Military in a whole is set up we Are the best of any counrty...

AA11204807	  Hey. Sorry to get off the subject, but I need to address Ron:     McCain has 7 houses, and who cares anyway? He's rich, (as is Obama), and he's allowed to have as many houses as he can afford. Nobody gives Jay Leno a hard time for having tons of cars, and people think Al Gore actually deserved his Nobel Peace Prize and yet he owns this house:   A 20 room mansion ( not including 8  bathrooms ) heated by natural  gas. Add on a pool ( and a pool house) and a  separate guest house, all  heated by gas. In one month this residence consumes  more energy than the  average American household does in a year. The  average bill for electricity  and natural gas runs over $2400. In natural gas  alone, this property  consumes more than 20 times the national average for  an American home. This  house is not situated in a Northern or Midwestern  "snow belt" area. It's in the South.    You can verify it at:*  http://www.snopes.com/politics/bush/hous...        Fun Fact:  Sean Hannity offered to send Obama's 1/2 brother $10,000 of his own money if Obama would do an interview on the Hannity & Colmes show, but so far, he's refused. |`|XhUtL3Tkaa	what does this have to do with obama's politics?  you know nothing about his 'half brother', or the circumstances surrounding the situation!    if you don't like obama don't like him for his politics.. not for a half brother that he may/may not have that may/ may not live in a shack.    grow up he is running to be your president, not your half brother |`|AgMd9GnRaa	He's NOT a nice guy; he's tough as nails and is determined to get what he wants and he'll do whatever he has to do to get it. All so he can help us, of course. lol|`|OeG9Mf8Aaa	I (swear to God) heard I have a half brother living in Illinois and I'm in NY. I'm doing pretty well for myself and I hear he is not.

McCain 08|`|hZA5m1ZAaa	No. didnt know that what a jackass thing to do-- he does seem really nice though, maybe his brother wants to live there or something |`|18h5UQ9iaa	If Mcain has a half brother that he refused to help...that is ALL we would be hearing about ALL day EVERY day.   People are so funny. |`|6cf45f1e4b4887d9df5323037a43c464aa	Oh you really need to give up playing this game. We can always go back to the fact that McCain had an affair with Cindy while married to his first wife; dumped his first wife after she was injured and no longer the long-legged stunner he wanted, or talk about Palin's attempts to cover up both her adultery and the TrooperGate scandal.    But I don't want to get into mud-slinging...|`|4bf562ccbf266e504b30ac04a5e0a34aaa	We really don't know the reason if this is true, that Obama does not help his half brother it is probably a lot more to this story, who says he didn't try to help him, or maybe he is on drugs.

Instead of simply repeating what you read on a blog somewhere why don't you find out the facts before coming on here and embarrassing yourself.|`|LzHZrUc9aa	Maybe McCain should give him one of his 12 houses around the country. Obama only has one you know. I'd vote for the man with one house every time. He understands me better.|`|CK0oO8wFaa	I didn't know that but I wouldn't be surprised.  He hides a lot of stuff about himself.  He stresses that his dad is from Kenya because he doesn't want people to lump him in w/ middle eastern terrorists even though he's almost half Arab.  But his dad was from a very corrupt and deadly militant group, not the peacemaking freedom fighter he says he is.      That must be where he got his name Obama bin Lyin' |`|k56mmj2eaa	no no you have it all wrong this guy is trying to look like he is trying to save the country.

From what I understand, they have met only twice. This is not like the half-brother with whom you grew up after mom got remarried. This is the son of Sen. Obama's father, born to a woman Sen. Obama has never met, decades after his father had been absent in his life.    The absence of help for this half-brother seems entirely normal to me; it is not an indication that his "nice guy" persona is a sham. For Sen. Obama to have helped him would be extraordinary,|`|9fdb1aec1eec12317a40aebc48023ffbaa	I think you could ask the same question to thousands of Americans of broken homes what they are doing for their step brothers and sisters!  I am sure the answer will be nothing.  When you dispute a candidate's position on economics or foreign affairs or any other important topic you are acting mature and within the forum or debate used for parties with differences in on how to handles situations in the country.  When you continue to attack people and their families, make up false information on their heritage or the country of their parents origin or attack them for race or gender you cross a line that puts your moral character in question.  I am 61 and have 2 wonderful granddaughters one of which is doing very well in church and church activities, winning top awards by her church on her participitation in Ewana Youth and other church activities. My problem now is after watching these debates, ads and and remarks by the republican base ( which is a christian base ) I am seriously thinking of pulling her out of her church. I do not want her to grow up with a judgemental attitude or thinking that slandering someone who may not have the same views as you, especially when they have been proven wrong, is okay. I think I want more for my grandchildren that what you have been portraying as the base supposedly who stands up for better morals, honesty and forgiveness.  Something has happened to the christianity I knew when I was growing up and they do not have the same morals of earlier years.|`|ifEN0GtWaa	it's not obamas fault his father met someone else after he was conceived. maybe his bro wants to live like that. i don't like obama, but for some reason he kinds reminds me of ab lincoln. if he is elected i hope he does a good job for the UNITED STATES AND HER PEOPLE.

When I began my study of the three economic philosophies I found positives and negatives in all three.    The goal is not to be just one of the three-but to have parts of all three.      And by the way-we are not a pure Capitalist country-we never have been.    Propaganda, my friend-is a powerful tool.|`|I1jzTp3haa	They call him a socialist as an insult, even though he is far from socialist.  Except for maybe his healthcare plan, because he wants to reimburse insurance companies for medical care.  Read up on the Medicare system and you'll see what a dumb idea this is.  Regardless, its because he leans more towards socialism than McCain, but he is not an extreme socialist.    Also some of his connections and contacts are either socialists or similar to that.  Socialism is very generally categorized as the basic loss of economic freedoms through government mandates and control.  Obama says time and time again that some regulation can be a good thing if implemented correctly.  McCain says to keep the market as free as possible by minimizing regulation.    Many of those against such ideas as universal healthcare and education might say these ideas are socialist and will ruin the economy because government will take away rich people's money and give it to poor people.  They argue that rich people deserve there money because they've earned and taking it away will take away from their investments in the economy which will reduce jobs and so forth.      On the other hand, many countries have prospered under universal healthcare and education whom aren't outwright socialists.  Taiwan, Germany, UK.  Then again, other countries have completely screwed it up, like Canada.  Also, these countries tax a lot more to afford these programs.  Which increasing someones taxes might make them say Obama is a socialist.    The main difference is that McCain wants to give money back to the rich to invest in the economy.  Obama wants to take money from the rich and give it to the poor so that the poor can give the money back to the rich.  Everybody has a different opinion of how and why, but Republicans and Democrats haven't changed for awhile.|`|CK0oO8wFaa	This is a very good article about it     http://chrisofrights.blogspot.com/2008/0...

It ain't coming out of Obama's pocket.  It's coming out of the slightly-above-low-class' pockets and that's not fair.

It's called researching the background of the candidate.|`|HPbVUj2waa	The very definition of socialism is the redistribution of wealth.  Obama believes that if he can tax the rich, then he can make things better for the poor by redistributing wealth.   The main historical problem with socialism is that it inevitably leads to fascism, which has historically, always led to mass murder.  This is why things like taxing the rich never work. People like Obama think he can tax the rich only, but that never works. The rich poeple own businesses and when thier over head goes up due to taxes, they just raise their prices and pass the pain on to you and me, the consumer.  Besides, I never got a job from a poor guy. If the rich are doing well, then the people who work for the rich can do well too.  The real question about Obama is what does he mean specifically when he says, "change" ? What does he want to change, how, when, who will be in charge of it?  If you really want change, how about this: If it is illeagal for you to lie to congress, then why is it okay for congress to lie to us?   The bottom line is that socialism is the redistribution of wealth and it has NEVER worked, and it always ends badly.|`|AA11209233	When you cut taxes for the rich and bail out failed corporations, they call this the free market.  When you bail out people, they call it socialism.      Some idiots see everything as black and white.  Adam Smith's policies failed just as fast as Karl Marx's did, though some think it is unamerican to admit this.  We need to balance our economy in a way that ensures competition while also leveling the playing field for labor providers.  People with jobs do not have the same flexibility in the market that companies do to quit and find another job, so employees get screwed if they aren't protected.    I also don't understand why anyone would call the Democrats the party of big government.  The government always gets bigger whenever a Republican is president (and the fed consolidates power, attacks personal freedom, and all those other things that party claims to fight against).  Your last president created a new Cabinet Department--when's the last time a dem did that--when we were saddled with the Dept. of Education?|`|60b9dfe6f51297e42ee09b44b6987147aa	He is a socialist in that he sees government as the solution to the country's problems. He wants more power consolidated in the federal government and less in the hands of individuals. He is for wealth redistribution with his tax policies. He supports taking away the citizens right to bare arms through handgun bans, which has traditionally been the first step in any slip into dictatorship. And he wants the government to control how businesses operate to an unreasonable extent.    Not all democrats hold this far left a position. Miller is conservative enough to qualify as a moderate republican. Most democrats from southern states are rather moderate. But Obama is far to the left and therefore I think deserves the label of socialist.|`|de5bda1b9dad2b1e94d22f6f86adf6beaa	If walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and waddles like a duck.  It is a good chance it is a duck and you calling it something doesn't matter.    Obama thinks the government should take money away from the rich and give it to the poor.    He wants the government to control health care.    That is the making of a socialist. |`|vNOkPdEMaa	socialism is an economic theory.  a democrat is a political party affiliation.  any person believing in vested government ownership/ control for the benefit of the community rather than the individual.  it's the step before communism.  so listen to Obama and you decide.    |`|z9UAnf3Waa	Because he is.|`|6a302ded0cb3ae070fbcb6449e4449efaa	Some people are saying it's "just mudslinging and insults." They're wrong.  Democrats, by definition, believe in bigger federal government and the larger and more all-encompassing social programs that go with it.    Obama said, during an interview with Bill O'Reilly:  "The problem is... If I'm sitting pretty, and you've got a waitress who's making minimum wage plus tips, and I can afford it and she can't, what's the big deal for me to say I'm going to pay a little bit more. That, that, that is neighborliness."    There is nothing "neighborly" about the forced redistribution of wealth.  If the government forces you to do this, it's not "neighborliness," it's Marxism/Socialism, a form of communism. Karl Marx believed that, under a communist system, every person should "contribute to society to the best of their ability and consume from society in proportion to their needs," regardless of how much they have contributed. This is what Obama proposes.     It's not mudslinging or propaganda; it's the truth, according to his own statements.    Government health care already exists for the "poor" in the form of Medicaid and SCHIP. What people want and need is health care for those who don't qualify as "poor," but who aren't able to afford or can't get traditional insurance. This is a problem - one that I am currently experiencing myself - but isn't necessarily solved by "government" or "socialized" healthcare.|`|SS1VReF0aa	Wealth redistribution and government health care    Obama did himself a huge disservice by calling his idea "government health care" because that immediately makes people think of Canada and Europe. It is actually a plan for government insurance (much different). I have read his entire plan for his health insurance, multiple times, and the financial aspects of it are grossly misrepresented. It is not pure socialism, but it is a form of socialism because he wants to get the government into a business that is currently part of the free market...therefore its a form of socialism "the nationalization of services" ...yes there are different forms of socialism and not every socialist is the same. Social democrats propose selective nationalization of key national industries in mixed economies combined with tax-funded welfare programs...ding ding ding....we have a winner! Its socialism.    I have also read up on his tax plan and by most accounts it is a plan for redistribution of wealth. All socialists advocate the creation of an egalitarian society, in which wealth and power are distributed more evenly...    I have been reading up on Obama's plans for a year now and understand them fully. His tax plan is 100% socialist and his health care plan is a form of socialism known as democratic socialism.|`|AA11980369	Because all of his ideas are the government taking care of you... a socialist attribute!|`|8fcdxKpraa	They don't know what socialism is and a scare tactic fallacy.

An increase in tax revenue from the increased taxes on the 5% of the population will have to go directly to fund these tax credits.  Further, taxing corporations will just increase the price of goods and services.  There will be no other option but to increase taxes on EVERYONE to make up the difference needed to run the government.|`|0bca92964b851ca1b2f27db7faf7f57baa	How can you give tax breaks to 95% of people when 45% of them don't pay taxes? This will come in the form of a tax credit for the non-taxed which equates to nothing more than the redistribution of wealth, with the middle class footing the bill.

It will not give you a larger "tax break" than Bush is giving you (HE SAID THIS IN THE DEBATE), but it will raise taxes for the top 5% of earners.  So...if you make over $250,000, you will pay more taxes.  Why is this good? Because extra tax relieves the national debt which reduces INFLATION (that's how much the price of goods and services go up each year).  Inflation during Clinton's 8 years was about 3% to about 28% during Bush's years.|`|DHNvyFe6aa	Of course not. It just sounds good to people which will give him more votes.

Also, just look at all his radical associations, either he has a terrible judgement of picking friends or he is just like one of them. I believe the latter is true.    In addition, he is not what he says he is. Obama's father figure mentor (in his memoir book, he refers to him as only "Frank") was Frank Marshall Davis, leader of the Communist Group USA, which makes him very dangerous for our country. See link:    http://www.aim.org/aim-column/obamas-com...    Plus, we do not want our country to be controlled by Pelosi, Reid, Obama, and Biden. No thanks to socialism!! No thanks to higher taxes!! No thanks to more government agencies!! No thanks to a failed Congress!!    All these democrats, Frank Barney (chairman of finance commmitte), Chris Dodd (chairman of banking committee) are responsible for the financial crisis, allowing Freddie/Fannie making these bad loans to lower income people for years..... And guess who was the second most receipient of money from Freddie/Fannie, well it was Obama.     I have sent a letter to FBI to investigate, Obama, Dodd, Barney and SEC chaiman Christopher Cox... The FBI is already investigating CEO's going back 10 years, when the housing bubble started in 1998. They include, Freedie, Fannie, Lehman, Bear Sterns, Merryl Lynch, Washington Mutual and AIG. These are the people who are responsible of our money, banking system, and investments. And Obama has been receiving sweet deals from these same people.    This is very serious!!!

I'm sure their are some Christians who would like that (as long as it was the Christian religion that ruled over everybody) They DO want everyone's children to have to stop and pray like that at school, even though not all children come from the Christian faith and don't want to be forced to, or to see it, hear it, whatever. That's for church or home.    We can't allow even the smallest of infractions like that to occur in this country. It's too risky. I would NOT want to live in a country where religion was the law!

zXcJ6Y2daa	We still need bombers and transport planes, but I agree, Fighters were a different time with different needs. War was much more conventional back then, it was between to equal powered countries or alliances. If we attack Iran we'll need them, but otherwise, nope. Today calls for more special ops and much lighter fighting strategies, like s Humvee versus a tank. The navy still spends money on big battleships, when it needs to spend more on smaller riverine forces.   The problem is some of our politicians and military leaders are stuck in a time when you needed a big fighter plane, when nowadays that wont work.|`|LzHZrUc9aa	Russia and China are both working on their own stealth fighters to rival the F-22 and 35.

Palin well connected to the Camera, not Biden, Biden turned his away so many times (only when speaking about foreign policy, he is looking at the camera)    2. Mentioning about John McCain - It is normal for Palin to do it, but Biden did that too in a negative way, to me Biden sounded like he is running for President attacking McCain rather than backup Obama up.    3. This got Biden when Palin said "Senator Biden said Obama is not fit for Commander in chief and I don't know how senator you can defend that"  Biden was speechless!|`|9iOjhq9eaa	They both did well, but Sarah pulled out ahead of Biden.|`|LJ2OqF1saa	It depends on who you ask, and which news outlet you watch.  ABC,CBS,NBC,CNN,MSNBC have showed Biden, last time I saw Fox which has nearly 40% of Dem's who watch, had Palin winning the debate.    Personally I feel that she did a better job than what was anticipated, many Dem's on here kept saying and asking when will she "cry",  Well she never choked up, but Biden did, I guess this was to show his softer side.  and Yes I know that he was talking about his first wife and all, but all their statements had to do with crying.    I enjoyed how she came across, and that she spoke to biden, and she spoke to us.  What really struck me was when they were speaking on economics and Biden saying people in his neighborhood being hit hard.  Well let me just tell you.....have you ever seen his neighborhood, where he lives, well it ain't no middle american home I can tell you that.  I do have to say that Palin knows where middle america is....she was one of us.  You have to realize that how hard live is in Alaska, and what the median income is in Alaska....she grew up in a middle income family, and even as a sports reporter she did not make that much money.  In Alaska, their income is less than what we make here.  So she knows and understands how we are hurting,  and how both parties have hurt us economically.|`|e7ac2e63eddf35a4851ec1d1a089b183aa	Palin|`|wpCrI69Zaa	Biden. Palin is charismatic, but she lacks experience and substance. She repeated 5 sentences constantly, changing the words.|`|oqd8kxF8aa	That's an interesting question here is my take:    1. Biden won overall but  A. Palin did not implode by any measure like she did on the Katie Couric interview  B. Palin spoke in a very strange vernacular, which no one seems to know how voters will take it - but the early polls didn't show they were impressed. Despite that, however, she seemed more confident    Overall Biden won, but everyone expected that to begin with. Palin did, if nothing else no damage|`|05BHQXvfaa	Biden    He was the only one of the two who managed to answer most all of the questions with straight, clear and concise answers. Palin almost seemed like she had memorized sentences beforehand and just spouted off stuff that seemed somewhat relevant to the question. She did better than I thought she would but she still performed poorly.|`|jBzx9PQwaa	Biden.  He spoke with stability and knew his facts and had back ups when Palin tried to throw him off.  He told her what a "Maverick" should vote for and what this Maverick voted against.  I really hate that word they came up with.    Anyway however I was suprised that she handled herself very well and she did a good job.  Howver she needed to get into McCains file a little bit more.
FhrcfpEYaa	Scary isn't it? These elitists (McSame and Quaylin) think that most of America doesn't do anything, that they should work harder and volunteer for free, that working for business is patriotic etc etc. and that is change. They think WE are the do nothing crowd.     The government under republican leadership is the DO NOTHING CROWD, and it would not change at all under the Reaganesque motto: "government IS the problem". It just causes  Wrecking Crew Republican contractors to destroy it. It doesn't need to be destroyed, it needs to WORK.

The thing is that although Biden seemed much more authoritative and less speechy (he should, after all his years of experience INCLUDING presidential debates), the analysis has come up with MULTIPLE inaccuracies that he put forward about McCain and his record.

Same goes for Obama.|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	D+     I wouldn't consider the vice-presidency the second most important job in the country either.     There are people who save lives on a daily basis.

For the most part, it's a job that goes unnoticed unless you screw it up (Cheney) or the President dies (Johnson, et al).    Don't buy that?    Then try a simple experiment. Give yourself two minutes to write down the names of as many US Presidents as you can, unaided by book or computer. Then give yourself 20 minutes to recall an equal number of VP's.    That said, I give her a pretty solid B. She had command of the facts, kept her cool, and did a nice job between being cordial with Joe B, and being on the attack.

Palin repeated RNC talking points and was not capable of follow up,  some "victory."|`|mT6b7INZaa	ROTFLMAO !!!      The Drudge Report ?????   OMG that is funny..|`|r6dJTGQKaa	The only poll that states that is the one in your head...|`|X81oLqMtaa	Uhhh....of course the right-wing news sites are going to show that Palin won, just like the left-wing news sites are going to show that Biden won.

Biden won hands downI was truly impressed by himPalin on the other hand did what she knows best.avoided questions that she didnt want to answer and talked about topics that had nothing to do with the question asked by the moderator..only a fool would be swayed by her homespun humor and winks at the audienceI loved it when Biden asked her what makes McCain a Maverick and then broke it down why he was not.she is truly unqualified for the position!!!|`|27sSI5wxaa	The polls that matter don't say that.    next...
7pgHntqjaa	Yes! Lol she completely pwned himm. |`|j0wloIVgaa	I only heard her refer to some civil war general.  There was no Biden lie.  It was more Palin confusion.|`|1NWjta2jaa	There were 10 (!) statements from Biden, which were complete lies. There were some statements from Palin, which are open for discussion, but not complete lies like Biden's. BUT, it doesn't matter because the media and Obama's supporters here and everywhere else still insist that Biden "wiped the floor" with Palin. Wasn't this the popular phrase here on Yahoo?  I said it before, no matter what Palin and McCain do or say, it will be twisted around anyway. And if Obama wins the election by 1 vote, it will be called a landslide, but if McCain wins the election by 20 million votes, it will be called cheating. Too bad, but this is the way it is.|`|vIO2jWu9aa	Joe lied and the liberal media keeps saying that Sarah didn't do well.  Sarah talked to the people, not down to them.

Why didn't Palin know who the commander is in Afghanistan?|`|oDglEUJ2aa	He stumbled because Palin named a general from the Civil War.  He was trying to understand just how back in time did they coach her?    http://clipmarks.com/clipmark/0009E68F-9...    But she was determined to get her point out.  You betcha!  Golly gee!    |`|AA12358300	He was also speechless when she mentioned him about saying Obama does not fit for the position as Command in chief|`|YqaKgYQ9aa	I think Palin did excellent considering she has been in this for 5 weeks to Bidens 35 years|`|IDZTtipeaa	From press reports before the debate:  The new top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said yesterday that more U.S. troops are urgently required to combat a worsening insurgency, but he stated emphatically that no Iraq-style surge of forces will end the conflict there.   Afghanistan is not Iraq, said Gen. David McKiernan, who led ground forces during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and took over four months ago as head of the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan.  The word I don't use for Afghanistan is 'surge,'  McKiernan emphasized, saying that what is required instead is a sustained commitment to a counterinsurgency effort that could last many more years and would ultimately require a political, not military, solution.       From Biden at the debate:  "The fact is that our commanding general in Afghanistan said today that a surge -- the surge principles used in Iraq will not -- well, let me say this again now -- our commanding general in Afghanistan said the surge principle in Iraq will not work in Afghanistan, not Joe Biden, our commanding general in Afghanistan.  He said we need more troops. We need government-building. We need to spend more money on the infrastructure in Afghanistan."      What was your question again?|`|OdrgLFFOaa	She was the one lying and she also kept calling the general by the wrong name:    Gen. David McKiernan, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, was quoted on Oct. 2 in The Washington Post as saying that "no Iraq-style 'surge' of forces will end the conflict" in Afghanistan, even though more U.S. troops are needed to take on a growing insurgency.    "Afghanistan is not Iraq," McKiernan said in Washington on Oct. 1. He also said "the word I don't use for Afghanistan is 'surge.' " He called for a "sustained commitment" leading to a political and not just a military solution.    He said Afghanistan is a "far more complex environment than I ever found in Iraq." The newspaper paraphrased him as citing the country's "unique challenges"  "the mountainous terrain, rural population, poverty, illiteracy, 400 major tribal networks and history of civil war."    |`|hJiWqnf5aa	Joe Biden was caught, in a grand total of 14 lies.

Another lie from palin.|`|yrDqtazLaa	Did you see when Palin dodged the questions Biden asked her?
wNcTEADJaa	laughed with her.  what a great sport.  just shows she could care less about how the media has been depicting her.  |`|Svanlzg7aa	Our local radio station DJ said it best    SNL has managed to pack 15 minutes of humor into an hour and half.|`|4uike3ARaa	At least she finally appeared at a venue for which she is actually qualified. Maybe there's a career for her there after Nov. 4th. |`|lklwmGh6aa	I laughed at her, this tough guy persona, give me a break...I loved how they made fun of her right in front of her face..it was great!|`|GHfaIQn3aa	I think she will go into entertainment.    She was a pageant contestant so I think she prefers entertainment to politics, but probably couldn't get her career off the other way. Now, she'll use the national exposure she is getting to get a talk show or something.|`|AA12358300	sure.. I laughed.    I guess politicians are stressed out|`|sg2UdK5haa	actually, she was not at all funny.  Her interviews are much funnier, although I don't think she intends them to be.|`|QLngWb3Aaa	Now that Sarah Palin appeared as "herself" in the SNL, people will not take her seriously. She has been a joke from the begining. |`|zWj5wcsdaa	I laughed both at her and with her. The smartest thing she could do was to appear on that show and show that she has a sense of humor. She has handled their making fun of her with grace and class. I hate to give her credit, but I have to in that case. I still won't vote for her, but I would be willing to bet that appearance did more for the McCain/Palin campaign than any of their other appearances have.
AA10195289	That was a death blow to Palin.    Maverick was the only string she had left and he destroyed it.     |`|KcAehrrKaa	I loved it and I hope it struck a cord with some of the voters. Because he isn't, they could have killed him in Vietnam.|`|5bc573709d2301dbc5c81af9e279c79caa	Joe Biden hasn't told the truth since 1973.|`|Y2REz1LMaa	GO JOE!!!!  That was fabulous!|`|AA12358300	Did Biden once say Obama not fit for the position as commander in chief???    The answer is YES!!    so why do you care about what politicans say.. They lie all the time!|`|7mTJ6WVRaa	I love Joe Biden! He is brilliant and he was right about McCain NOT being a maverick.|`|vObP9iYUaa	at that moment I said out loud "I love Joe Biden"|`|4NOyBfzraa	I agreed with him, I'd already formed that opinion. he just reflected it.|`|kqdimS6Iaa	A "maverick" is one willing to change things.....................    Unfortunately, John Mccain has voted over 90% of the time with George Bush policies(his own words caught on t.v)........that is not a maverick........thats a George W Bush clone just waiting to do 4 more years of the last 8 we've had.|`|d29b5ecd97729e864b2cbef75452fef9aa	Loved it.  I waited all night for that.  Im so tired of the claims that McSame is a "maverick".  What a joke.   
AA11103371	He is not a terrorist.  McCain is clinging to the only thing he think can win him the election.  Fear and lies.  Its' an erratic response for an out of touch old man who just doesn't get it and knows he can't win on any real issue like the economy.  In this polarized nation Obama is going to win by a landslide.|`|Y692N65Waa	Ayers is still running around too.

OBAMA taught them how to do this..ACORN was his baby and where he got his experience.  this is nothing.    Obama/Acorn went to banks and pulled a race card on them and shook them down for contributions...    Palin may not be everything you want..I like her just fine...but the likes of Pelosi, Obama and Hillary are vile. You ask me not to bash and I will not, but they just don't have your best interest...only winning at all costs..|`|cKL9AD0Jaa	There is nothing illegal or unethical about getting people with a legal right to vote to do so.    However, the bogus decertification of hundreds of thousands of registered voters in historically Democratic areas, the harassment of people providing transportation for voters from Indian Reservations, and the hacking of voting machine systems are all illegal and are now traditional Republican party crimes.|`|Qjb1qRbYaa	Does the ACORN bus ride come with a paper sack lunch also?|`|c9a1f0964ec1c52f2b99f929391af5d7aa	Homeless people have the same right to vote as the ashe-wholes who made them homeless.

ACORN already has had 1800 registrations tossed in Ohio ( all democratic ).  How many were accepted as ok from ACORN------- 6. Why were the 1800 tossed?  Duplicated in many cases triplicated people, felons, and in some cases, ages as low as 14 year olds.    This is ACORN........it's what they do.......it's who Obama worked for as a field trainer and attorney representing ACORN in lawsuits for voter fraud.     These radical non profit business go nuts over Obama to the point of well documented fraud and now FBI is investigating and ready to file charges. Obama will never admit this but will call it a smear tactic if McCain brings it up.    And people want to vote for Obama as a honest person with integrity?|`|66865cd4d5e25998b341b212d292b6faaa	there's no law stating that homeless people can't vote.  i don't give a shiz how many homeless people he pulls out his azz, i'm still voting for him.|`|7mxqwjEpaa	because he will do anything to get an extra vote....do you really think that he would throw those votes away from homeless and drug diseased people? They were paid to vote for him or given a free meal.. whoever came up with this is ridiculous....that's just not right or fair...its sad|`|AEuqzxcLaa	Why should he stop qualified people from voting in an election just because they have been foreclosed on?  That is the job of the Republicans to deny individuals their right to vote in an election. |`|WxZZl346aa	People down on their luck can't vote. Wow!!!    And you think that giving a homeless person a ride to a voting poll is THE SAME as giving $20.00, something that a homeless person would want/need more than a ride to a polling place.     That means you would have to think that someone is going up to homeless people saying "Hey if you vote for Obama I'll give you a free ride to a place that you really don't need and may not even want to go to." and they said "Hell Yeah!"|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	He approves.|`|AA10302860	I know...one thing I know about homeless people is they have no right to vote whatsoever...and don't even get me started about people in rehab centers.  They say they are there for rehab...but who knows for sure.  The founding fathers were right when they said you have to have land to vote...because these no home having people don't have a stake in anything....their home is already gone.    And the rehab people are just lazy.  Go rehab at home!  Unless you're homeless I guess.  It's very unamerican to have everyone voting!  |`|28b037c9067df2ec28f25fbd2bab84e3aa	Why is it unethical to pick up homeless people?  Do you think they shouldn't be allowed to vote?  Are you even aware that a disproportionately large number of the homeless are veterans?    The same applies to rehab centers.  There is really no reason at all why a person with a substance abuse problem should be prevented from voting.  Although having one as President, as we have been finding out lately, is a bad idea.|`|FvwmRtNjaa	Why is it unethical? Those people have a right to vote, and they are not being forced to vote for any particular candidate.

This will go down to the wire for me|`|VUgCSQ6Daa	I am an Independent and leaning towards McCain, simply because I think Obama's economic policies are bad for the country, not because I like McCain.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I'm an independent voter, and I'm going with Bob Barr. The Libertarians are the only party that understand and will work to defend our Constitutional liberties. |`|c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	Independent voting McCain.  I'll take the moderate over the socialist.|`|2bca07912249cffd6d15a663fd5ae28caa	i'm an old school conservative / libertarian who will vote for Obama. i would otherwise vote for Barr, but it is our electoral system, not the voters, that ?s responsible for the concept of "wasted votes".    the problem with McCain is that he's no "maverick". he's entirely beholden to the Neoconservative Vermin running the Republican Party today. his choice of Palin in proof positive of that. Neocons would have you believe that only they are the salvation of the country, and that only military might makes right. individuals don't really matter, except to the extent that you fit into their "Judeo-Christian" viewpoint. their campaign slogan, "Country First", is right out of the Nazi playbook of "Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Fhrer!" i'm a conservative of the New England congregational variety, where everyone minds their own business.    i also agree entirely with Andrew Bacevich, a conservative, who said "For conservatives to hope the election of yet another Republican will set things right is surely in vain. To believe that President John McCain will reduce the scope and intrusiveness of federal authority, cut the imperial presidency down to size, and put the government on a pay-as-you-go basis is to succumb to a great delusion."
n5wvy5FYaa	YES!!!    Expose the truth about Obama to the masses because ABC, CBS and NBC refuse to.    ? Obama plans to ban the use of firearms by law-abiding citizens  even for self-defense.     ? Obama's values are heavily influenced by his bigamist father and raised in a Muslim society.    ? Obama will raise tax rates to a Hoover-like 60 percent.     ? Obama will transform the U.S. Treasury into the United Nations' ATM.     ? Obama wants fuel prices high and farmland taken out of production.     ? Obama will grant federal medical insurance to 12 million illegal aliens and increase emergency room costs alone by $15.4 billion annually.     ? Obama will transfer child-rearing from parents to the federal government with his secular "0 to 5" program.     |`|xZy05taKaa	YES!!!!    Obama is NOT the solution.    Ron Paul may have been but NOT Obama  Obama is worse, and his record shows that along with his motives.  Obama was as much FOR the bailout as McCain    Obama is a racists  Obama does not want to blame himself for his childhood abandonment, nor does he want to blame his father. Thus he is feeling less abandoned by his father through feeling as angry as the black militant movement of the 1960s, because he feels connected to his father by assuming what he believes were his father's plights..    That is why he went to Rev Wrights church for 20 years.    Rev Wright follows the teachings of Dr Cone Obama follows BOTH Cone and Ayers.  in his beliefs:  Dr. Cones, Rev. Wright's, Obama's    Black theology is that if God does not fight for Black Power than he is NOT God. Black theology is Black Power, Black Panthers, Marxism, communism.    Obama does not care about the god factor it is white supremacy Obama wants to blame, and capitalism  |`|Wyt8vBPPaa	Yet another stupid question that brings up distractions rather than actual facts or issues to try and discredit Obama. Nice try.    As far as protecting the Constitution, why doesn't McCain believe that healthcare to all citizens is a right? Ever heard of Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness? Or should we just amend the Constitution left and right to alienate any group of people that doesn't fit in with the Republican voting base?|`|Rh2ge7ajaa	Get over it.

He was talking about the question of when life begins and indicating that no human knows the answer to that, only God.  Philosophers and other brilliant men have debating that question since time began, and it is a sign of intelligence to be humble about the eternal questions.    You, on the other hand, feel you know all the answers.  Sad.  :(|`|Og5FUuuraa	We've put up with the moron the republicans put in office for 8 years.

Obama 08!|`|AA12341057	In your opposition to the Democrats, you haven't been paying much attention to the Republicans lately, have you?     What deceit? He admits he's met Ayers a few times. What did he say about his thesis? (Those are all publicly available at Harvard University's Library, if you'd like to read it). He was up front about Wright too. Louis Farrakhans only connection is that he's also black- that doesn't mean Obama has anything to do with him.    Now, McCain. When he says he's a maverick, it means that he's ineffective. It means he's spent 20 years trying to change the Republican Party, and it also means he's failed. If he'd successfully shown any leadership within the GOP, they would have adopted his ideas, and he would just be mainstream. Twenty years of frustration in the Senate does not qualify anyone to be President of the United States. Exactly what aspect of the Job of Senator do you believe translates to President?    Unfortunately Republican Policy over the last decade has been to weaken the Constitution as fast as possible. The Patriot Act, Guantanamo, President Bush's domestic spying, and now the governments purchase of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac five weeks ago means that we are now a socialist country.    Your party poked too many holes in the Constitution to stand behind it.|`|bb16e0fee5dbb1a2424144b4283cf549aa	As a McCain supporter, you would certainly wish that were true but its not.

The same could be said of John McCain.  He's flat out lying to us on his economic policy - claiming to be in favor of regulation when his legal AND illegal activities throughout his career favor deregulation and the trickle-down economic policies of his "hero" Ronald Reagan.    Instead of getting your news from Sarah Palin and the McCain campaign negative ads, try doing a little research.  You can start with McCain's involvement in the Keating five during the 1980s savings and loan crisis.    Believe what you like about Barack Obama.  If you're not comfortable with his association with Ayers and Wright, then by all means don't vote for him.  But don't believe that John McCain is somehow squeaky clean simply because he refers to himself as a reformer and a "maverick".  Don't be a sheep.  John McCain is every bit the corrupt Washington insider he's claiming he isn't.  |`|AA12284392	Absolutely!    Let's stand so far behind the Constitution that we won't even notice it as we run it over with a tank.    No, Obama's the man for the job, so there.

JuCUl0lJaa	Money doesn't exist anyway. It's an illusion. Money is only worth what we are made to believe it is worth by those who control things. We work to 'earn money', which in turn, we then spend to buy food, goods, etc. 'Money' is simply the channel with which we exchange things. It's value, which is determined  through how much things cost changes regularly, depending on how much those in power want to control us. The more they make things cost, the harder, and longer we have to work  to enable us to buy those things. The only way forward is for each and every one of us to start swapping skills, services and goods without using any money at all. We will then all be free - but like that is going to happen!.

It was paid to the owners of the properties that were sold to the deadbeats, the over-extended and the game players.    The reason the taxpayers are on the hook for it is pretty clear cut.    http://www.mtgprofessor.com/A%20-%20Seco...      An awful lot of cash changed hands in not only cash payments to sellers of property but also those who dealt in "securitized" mortgages, read as "guaranteed" debt.

It derives apparently either from the Latin word "monere" (remind, warn, or instruct) or the Greek word "moneres" (alone, unique).That doesn't really tell you what it really is.    But it does suggest that what we called "money" never really existed.It has always been a big confidence trick and the only reason people preferred it over time was that it was easier to handle and trade than turnips.

I am surprised they like didn't make ANY profit on the over inflated interest rates?|`|xE8orz6Daa	The money does exist.    It's called "toxic debt".    Basically it's money that cannot be paid back to the banks who lent it out in the first place.    Imagine if I borrowed 10 off you, and then you borrowed 10 off another person.    Both me and you owe money, but it is still money to be paid back, which does in fact exist.    If I don't give you your money back, your going to be in sh*t because you cannot pay your 10 back, and the person you borrowed it off cannot get their 10 back.    So basically, it's a chain reaction.    Now, if you switch people with the banks, then that's how it is. The banks all lent out money which was deemed "risky", and now they cannot get it back.    This means that banks are going under because there isn't enough money circulating in the system.    This is why banks need the backup of governments, otherwise savings, pensions and capitalisation as a whole is jeopardised.            |`|ne22im5Haa	If you were just being robbed you would be getting off lightly. you are being robbed, humiliated, mocked and thoroughly rogered up the poop chute.

He's pro war.                                           2.  He's anti-gay rights.                                           3.  He's a total idiot on the economy.                                           4.  He's old.                                           5.  He voted for use of military force in Iraq. Supported Bush veto                                                                   of war spending bill that would have withdrawn most U.S.                                                                troops by March 2008. He was an early proponent of sending                                                                additional American troops to Iraq.                                                         6.  When we're paying more than $4 a gallon for gas, McCain wants to                                                               spend $1.2 billion on a tax break for Exxon Mobil                                                         7.   He has been endorsed by George W. Bush, for president. Bush stated that                                                               McCain has the "character, courage and perseverance" to lead the country.                                                                 (where's the punch line?)                                                         8.   He's willing to sacrifice investments in health care, education, energy, an                                                               infrastructure to allow for tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy CEOs.                                                         9.   In a recent speech, he said 'I will veto every beer' instead of every bill.                                                               We, Americans, need our beer. Get it right, McCain. You suck!                                                       10.  And, damnit! He's old!                                                          McCain just keeps adding to his own resume of why he sucks!                                            11.  He has plans to make zero exceptions for a woman's right to choose --                                                even in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother                                         12.  He's against the life-saving possibilities of stem cell research.                                         13.  He has no plans to protect equal pay for equal work.                                                          McCain sucks even more for choosing Sarah Palin as Vice President CLICK HERE                                                            If you think Bush was an awesome president, you'll absolutely love McCain.   14.    Palin recently said that the war in Iraq is "God's task."                                                      She's even admitted she hasn't thought about the war much                                                      just last year she was quoted saying, "I've been so focused on state                                                     government, I haven't really focused much on the war in Iraq."                                            15.    Palin has actively sought the support of the fringe                                                      Alaska Independence Party. Six months ago, Palin told members                                                      of the groupwho advocate for a vote on secession from the unionto                                                      "keep up the good work" and "wished the party luck on what she                                                       called its 'inspiring convention.'"                                            16.    Palin wants to teach creationism in public schools. She hasn't made                                                      clear whether she thinks evolution is a fact.                                            17.    Palin doesn't believe that humans contribute to global warming.                                                      Speaking about climate change, she said, "I'm not one though who                                                      would attribute it to being manmade."                                             18.   Palin has close ties to Big Oil. Her inauguration was even sponsored by BP.                                                      (Hmmm...this doesn't sound like a 3rd term of Bush at all.                                             19.    Palin is extremely anti-choice. She doesn't even support abortion in                                                       the case of rape or incest.                                              20.   Palin opposes comprehensive sex-ed in public schools. She's said she will only                                         support |`|AA12358300	It does not really matter if McCain wins the debate.. he may still lose, liberals are infesting the votes now..      the end is coming...|`|AA11863643	Divine intervention.|`|X8MLZ2kSaa	a back flip an a dance in a hula skirt.....lol    NOT IN A MILLION YEARS + 700BILLION DOLLARS MAN  {{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{{|`|HFumw7zaaa	A new VP would help, his arms need to be longer and he should stop looking up into the sky all the time.

His chances are slim to none and slim just rode off on a horse.  Palin should not have been his VP choice, but as a Dem, I'm happy that he chose her.

The votes will decide the presendential election (I hope -- that is, I hope the Republicans aren't able to steal this one, too, as they did the last two).    I am curious about that little delusion you've got going there.    Are you thinking one of them is Ms. Obama?    Tina FEY? Gimme a BREAK! Her imitations hit home because they're so spot ON. When no one knew anything about Palin, they had a more positive view of her (many did, I didn't). As we've seen more of her, people have realized what she really is.    I've never even heard of the other one, but just becuase a thing happens, then another thing, does NOT mean the first caused the second.    I believe that what's lead to McCain's tanking is McCain himself. His "I'll go SAVE this situation." ploy; his strange behavior during both debates; his negativity (which have all been repeatedly shown to be lies and distortions); his coming out with plicies after policy after policy, then taking them back. The hate incited at his rallies, and his having to try to backtrack from that.    AND, more people hearing more detail from Obama, seeing him cool under pressure; hearing him make a lot of sense; having analysts discuss the consequences to US of the two men's proposals.    Not everyone watches MSNBC you know.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	hmmm. Really, interesting question.    I will say that I like the choices up top of Tina Fey and Oprah.     I'll think about this one and come back.    I think Katie Couric's name has it's place as well. That interview with Palin was just damning. Even worse, and thus more played, than the Charles Gibson. I think that interview made many people start to ask more questions about whether she really had what it takes.     ************  I totally agree about Rachel Maddow. She really does a great job and particularly made Frum look kind of foolish, or I suppose completely disengenuous is a better way to put it.
dbda850d57ab67a8ccfcfc85bafa9914aa	I'm responding to this because of what "A Perfect Me" said. I am an educator to 4th grade students- who are at home right now because of the CA fires. I find her comment slightly insulting, as I try not to be biased when educating my students. It's amazing what these students say based on their parents' beliefs and perceptions and even while we read the newspapers.      I do find it interesting. We have yet to do a mocked election in my classroom, but I definitely will. Students are a lot smarter than what we give them credit for, especially these days.|`|eaaefbea98a700eb3c795d37d4a98523aa	That is why children can't vote, they don't have enough life experience to make a wise choice, clearly MANY of their successful choices were not wise in the past.|`|329e16bd855db48d292d1afce685f07aaa	From the mouths of babes......|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	That is interesting.

Politico is so liberal and so in love with Obama they have nothing objective to offer!

We'll need somebody in this poor dogeared country who can actually use his head to help us out of this horrible stock market mess the Republicans created.    Let's hope that's Mr. Obama.

He'll start by plucking our guns from our hands, and then he'll move on to making us more and more dependant on HIS Commi regime...    Fools... all of you!!!!!|`|bY7G2rRcaa	why don't you sit down and have a respectful discussion where you exchange what you know and you really listen to each other.|`|rCugrc5xaa	She is smarter than you. You can't trick her. Tell her to give me a call I'll give her that Obama Love shes been longing for.|`|5b17682b999fc3753a335f95a1eb84b9aa	Remind her that Obama would not qualify for a government security clearance, i.e. as a security guard for Boeing.   Also, Pelosi, Reid, Dodd and Frank are frontrunners in denying the regulation of the Fannie and Freddie debacle that has caused this economic meltdown,   Show her this video, if it doesn't work, search youtube for Burning down the house (not Talking Heads)|`|3N1jZdsNaa	You won't win a fight with your wife.  If you love her you might want to consider her viewpoint.    Watch a Chris Rock special and you'll get it.|`|lfXxs8Vdaa	U_U     you should NOT change her mind. You love her the way she is not for who is she voting.    I like Obama :)|`|rEo5gfO3aa	All I can say is a lot of people are really brainwashed. It's a divider between people because it means at the core we are really different. The thing that bothers me about it is she went behind your back doing this. This shows that she realises your fundamental differences as well. Just try to show her the facts. |`|AA10451175	First off you need to find out the reason she is voting for him. Then, you can easily talk her out of it.    If it is b/c of his Pro-Choice stance- Be sure to let her know that McCain isnt necessarily against a woman's choice, he just believes it should be up to the states and not something else the gov controls.    If it is b/c of war- McCain stated that he hates war just as much as everyone and he believes in making a time table to get out of Iraq. Also, make sure she knows it is Obama that is for invading Afganistan.    If it is b/c of healthcare- she needs to know that the Gov. will mandate it b/c they will have to with Obama's plan. Another thing the Gov. will have control of. McCain wants to put 5000 bucks in your pocket to get the best healthcare.    If it is b/c of taxes- McCain does not want to lower the "rich" people's taxes. He wants to leave it the same. Obama wants to raise taxes on small business and larger businesses. That will cause an economic downfall that will kill jobs. You can never raise taxes with a recession like we have. That is how the depression came to be.    Hope that helped. lol ;)|`|H76s9hjeaa	If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. And if not, tell her you want a divorce.

I have the same problem in my home and even if I get her to back me up," how do I know what she will actually do in the voting booth"?  My best shot is the leave things alone. I have bigger problems at home to worry about. These things just come and go and just not worth the great relation I have with my wife. In the things that matter most we support each other and this is where I need her the most. Good Luck!|`|KP3CfeGmaa	Why try to change her mind?  Isn't the voting system supposed to be based on individuals voting on who they think is the best candidate, not who their family or friends think is?   My dad tried to convince me to vote the way he wanted me to when I first turned legal age to vote, and I told him, no, I was going to vote for the person I thought was best qualified, and if that was the same one as him, then so be it, otherwise, oh well.  My advice, let her vote the way she wants, and you vote the way you want.|`|ce84d2b43eeaa43b06f1ec3a8a2c5910aa	I'm surprised she married you. She's obviously smarter and recognizes the terrible mess the republicans have made. If you have children, or want to have them, she's probably thinking about them. There's no way in hell this country could survive four more years of upper echelon criminality. We're closer to coming apart at the seams than people realize. Obama just might be able to fix it. It's probably 50/50 as Bush and his cronies like McCain have literally blow up the bridge to the 21st century in front of him. At this point, he really is our hope.   |`|5kfDZTpIaa	I say leave her alone.  She not your slave or property.  She has a right to vote for whoever she wants too.  Stop tying to control her.

President McCain has already won.|`|9EW08emXaa	Depending on what state you live in, one of your votes isn't going to matter anyway. So many states have their electoral votes so strongly in favor of one candidate that a couple disagreeing isn't going to matter. (I still think it's important for every person to vote, but just keep it in perspective.)    Of course you two should have a calm conversation about each candidate and why certain issues matter to you and how you see them affecting you and your family in the future.    I am surprised at the amount of people slamming on you or your wife for making choices.  Obviously, in a relationship you want to understand each other and also have some of the same goals. If a husband or a wife or a girlfriend or a boyfriend or a neighbor wants to share their views with each other....that's great. You may not change her mind, but communication is always important. As long as both parties are happy with communicating and knowing that you might not come to the same conclusion in the end.    Take the issues that are most important to you and discuss them with your wife.  Tell her that you really respect her opinion and you want her to vote for whoever she thinks will be best for the country and for your family.  Show the information that you find most important. Then, you can either agree with each other, or agree to disagree.      All this junk on here about "divorce her" or "she is too good for you" is just more partisan junk which has no place in a marriage.  Your marriage is top priority, so respect each other, but communicate your thoughts and feelings on all of this and the the topics that will be most important in next few years.    Record vs Rhetoric and Miss Dior had good answers for you as well.|`|SeyaUqtmaa	First,  find out WHY she is voting for him, what she likes etc. and LISTEN. Then point out where Obama fails to meet her expectations. One of my friends was an Obama supporter, and while talking to her and pointing out some of the things the biased news media didnt tell her and the fact that they are investigating him for accepting foreign funds (explains his campaigning over seas) and in about 45 min she was saying "I think i will just stay home" which is halfway to voting for McCain.  His connections to Fanny Mae are very troubling.  Listen to Rush Limbaugh for some juicy (and fact based, backedup) tidbits.    Heres a starter for you, he made number 8 for top ten  most corrupt polititians:  8.  Senator Barack Obama (D-IL):  A Dishonorable Mention last year, Senator Obama moves onto the ten most wanted list in 2007.  In 2006, it was discovered that Obama was involved in a suspicious real estate deal with an indicted political fundraiser, Antoin Tony Rezko.  In 2007, more reports surfaced of deeper and suspicious business and political connections  It was reported that just two months after he joined the Senate, Obama purchased $50,000 worth of stock in speculative companies whose major investors were his biggest campaign contributors.  One of the companies was a biotech concern that benefited from legislation Obama pushed just two weeks after the senator purchased $5,000 of the companys shares.  Obama was also nabbed conducting campaign business in his Senate office, a violation of federal law. (JudicialWatch.org)  notice that Nancy Pelosi is also on that list.    We can only hope that many will realise that he is not the man he claims to be, and just because he is black doesnt mean we should vote for him.    |`|2kTpJdKOaa	Nope because shes doing the right thing!!!!  |`|Pmnbthq9aa	She's free to support who she wants.

If she votes for obama - say you will file for divorce (you don't have to - it's just a scare tactic)  but if the woman chooses obama - please cut your loses - she has already been brainwahsed!|`|c312b6829a6336dc220a6748d4450751aa	Why would you want to?

Tell her to study her history, and find out that Barack Obama is doing the same exact thing as Hitler did to win the election in Germany before WWII. He is promising "change", and children are singing songs in his praise. Hitler changed the world alright!    Ask her if she wants the world to re-live history again.

They are guided by addictive rhetoric emotion and intentionally chose to remind blinded by his record. ( Hence my avatar name ). My in laws are long since retired union family. In their 70's, they haven't missed a union luncheon or dinner in 30 years. They have 100% voted democratic for decades because of the direction the union gives them.     Last week, I printed out web research on Hence state campaign in Ayers living room ( they had no clue who Bill Ayers was ) - they do now!  I printed out Senate Bill 190 from 5/25/06 co sponsored by McCain which Obama refused to vote on. They had no clue what this bill was ( they do now ). They know who ACORN is, but had no idea the links the DNC and Obama has given them $800,000 during the primaries.  They do now.    They took all of this material to their monthly union luncheon and asked the union people to comment about it.  Here's what they said....."Don't worry about any of that, it's not important and Obama hardly knew Bill Ayers."      The summary is simple......people who are voting for Obama, have not checked his record or don't care about his record.  To me, it's a marsh mellow attitude that's disgraceful to hand over the oval office to govern 300 million Americans. |`|uBqYq4CMaa	Debate her rationally.

jLxBvXZ5aa	Sure, I think he has a great chance.  Too many people were  rubbed the wrong way when they heard Obama say to Joe the plumber that he wanted to "spread the wealth."    That is the same old tired rhetoric that has always been used by the Democrats and they tried to tie it up in a bow and present it as something new.    Nothing is new, and there is no change.  Same old tired stuff from Obama to whittle away at the freedoms we have left.    We need to restore our freedoms and not let the left continue to try to remove them.    We will say no to socialism.    McCain/Palin all the way!!!    ~|`|midmBgJJaa	"lets face it, GENERALLY Liberals are less responsible and vociferious than republicans."    Please back up your crap.     The polls can be misleading but when they show Obama with 7-9% leads in most swing states one can't help but notice.     Sorry but I think Obama will be elected. He's very far ahead and I cannot think of any allegations that can ruin his chances.     Edit: Silly me. I didn't realize that minorities, young people, poor people, and college students were irresponsible.     P.S. Please back up your crap. :)|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	Plus there's the standard error margin of 3% assuming the poll was conducted correctly.  The more biased the poll is, the larger that error margin becomes.    Plus there's the observed 3% trend that overestimated Obama in the Democratic primaries.  When considering the whole nation, that overestimation is probably larger (sadly, most pollsters said this was probably due to racial bias).    Plus, with the proliferance of cell phones, polls have become less accurate over time.  18% of households are cell-only, that means 18% of the country is not being sampled in these polls.    And you're right, these things have been consistently wrong before.  Many won't vote for Obama thinking he's got it, some people are underdog voters that will back McCain because they see that Obama is the corporate bought candidate attacking with many expensive negative ads.    Realistically, I think this thing is still 50/50.  Even the real clear count is missing about 6%, if that's all for McCain, it certainly is 50/50.|`|AA12358300	Sure... like do you think third party has chances..    Every one does, Poll only shows certain individuals.. it may be 60% true...|`|1edb7e285e1837d108c2caf03520c8bbaa	I think bandwagon is about to happen. People always want to be on the winning side.

And he's worried too.     So yeah, McCain's got a decent shot. This will not be a landslide for the Dems, and in 2 years, I'm betting a lot of their Congressional seats will be GONE.|`|7U1CQxTdaa	Actually the type of people who partake in these polls are individuals who own landline telephones as that is how polling occurs. You know who have landline telepones? Old people, higher class individuals, and families. That is a strongly CONSERVATIVE demographic. I think it will be a bigger landslide than people think in Obama's favor. |`|4f5ff0e7b7304267a5075a39531e4ea4aa	  A lot of good points I don't think the Dem's will not show up thinking he has it in the bag and polls really don't mean a thing especially in the the toss up states in them states watch out if people going to the poles wearing an Obama pin or anything pertaining to Obama it can not be visible they can be turned away and not allowed to vote they will consider it soliciting votes you have to fifty yards away from the voting premises it has never been in forced but watch out the Republicans will do wherever it takes to win .|`|siwxWxa0aa	Of course he has a "chance" It's not over till its over. That being said, the likely-hood is slim.     I wouldn't use the two examples you used though, Gore won the popular vote (by over half a million) and the last election thousands of people were turned away. The last two elections were not above the table this is common knowledge. In 2000 Gore would have won, in 2004 Ohio would have put Kerry into the white house but as you can see voters were turned away. Not to mention the missing absentee ballots from men and women abroad.     Personally myself and everyone I know, we have a "bail me out" jar. If any of us are turned away we are NOT going quietly, enough is enough! We have been stomped into the ground as much as we are willing to take. I am telling everyone, when you go to the polls this time, bring a friend and cams. Do not let them take away your vote this time.     That being said, there are measures being taken to ensure that doesn't happen again. I hope for the countries sake, those precautions work. Neither side can afford there to be suspicions.|`|HQ7NJGTPaa	YOU ARE right on my man ! The liberals will be late to the gate; especially since they think they have this thing in the bag ! We know em' don't we ?|`|8dbf6c15b72bc1dbae183cc66d702856aa	McCain is toast.  If Sarah Palin wasn't his running mate, I think he would have stood a chance.  She is SOOOOOOOOOOOO scary!! I will vote for Obama just to keep her *** back in Alaska!!|`|AA10469398	I am thinking McCain is not likely to turn his campaign around.   Sure, there is always a chance and a lot can happen in 3 weeks.     There are a number of things that could affect the outcome of the election.    That said I did not see anything in McCain that would  change my mind and make me trust him.  His choice of Palin for VP convinced  me of my skepticism regarding his judgement.     McCain has to combat the perception he is of the party of Bush and tied to the financial crisis.  McCain may have a moral idiology but it won't be enough.   This may be the end of his political career.

If the culture of society has shifted so off the chart left where blantent dishonesty is obvious, lack of judgment beyond reason and an absence of credibility that he may win with Joe Gaff as the VP only confirms that the Bama voter could care less. All of the attributes normally mandated by the people to occupy the oval office is out the window for this man.     Actually it is the highest degree of affrimative action at the presidential level.

My exwife left me because she believed things to be true that were not. My heart still aches because I could not convince her of the truth. So if in fact he does have brain damage he does not need to be in office. Its amazing how powerful the mind is. I'm over my seperation now but the truth is the truth and with brain damage you cannot see the truth. McCain/Palin 2008!    But I also add this, Obama lost me from the start, I dont care if Colin Powell was Obamas running mate or even Albert Einstien. Obama lost me we he showed that he would not even aknowledge the national anthem. I believe him to hate you and hate me and hate every American. He wants to make you broke and homeless. He wants to make Palestine to take over all of Israel. Which I think Israel is what this election is all about. If America is broke they cant help Israel. Just my opinion though.|`|tGBWpPpraa	1. every president since washington has had to deal with foreign powers testing him. that's the job. biden also stated that the obama camp is already thinking about where these threats could come from and how best to deal with the situation. mccain states that no one will mess with him cause he was a POW. nice ego there.    2. biden's medical records were released on monday, where the hell have you been?    3. wow, where was this hatred of the "liberal media" when clinton was being blasted in the media for sending missiles into the sudan in '97 to get some guy we had never heard of, ol' what's his name, bin-laden i think it is? if your candidate can't field questions from katie couric (couric for god's sakes?! she can't answer questions from couric?!), that's not the media's fault. the media's job is to question, and don't think that they haven't questioned all of obama's credentials. obama has been dissected over the last 2 years, and guess what? after ayers, wright, muslim slanders, and everything else thrown at him, we the people voted him as our nominee, and now we the people are voting for him for president. |`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	You lie and someone posts youtube as a "reliable" source to back up your lie.

Consider:    1) ...if...and. That is not a complete sentence. You need a 'then' to finish the sentence.    2) Your hypothesis, as I see it, is if the tax rate goes up, is your job in jeopardy? Why don't you test the hypothesis - sure enough unemployment rates have been rising or falling since we started counting in 1900, yet tax rates have been all over the place, meaning there has been no significant correlation between the kinds of tax rates we have had and unemployment rates.    I could explain why it that you are wrong about tax rates and jobs, but what is the point? You are just trying to smear Obama don't give a hoot about tax rates and jobs.     3) Think about it! Think about it!    You will not be selling assets, cutting jobs. You will be finishing your high school English class. At least I hope so.

I have 3 businesses. Two mail order Pharmacy's and one Inpatient Pharmacy for Hospice. I will lay off at least 45 employees, and move my business to another Country.

I hope all business have notified their employees of this, they have the right to be informed. I too have told my employees, that their lives hang in the balance. And don't worry about your employees suing you. If you live in a Right to Work State, you have evey right to lay them off.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	First, the vast majority of small business owners will see tax cuts, not tax increases; add to that the breaks for offering health care, and well over 90% will be BETTER off under Obama, as will all of their employees.    Currently, the one percent of people who are the richest pay about 16% of their income in tax, while the poorest of their employees pay 30% of their incomes.    Oh, you're threatening your employees, trying to pressure them to vote against Obama and for McCain (who willimpoverish all of us except his rich friends)?    I suspect that's illegal; if not, it should be.    The rule by the policies McCain has espoused for decades has NOT expanded opportunities for over 95% of the citizens of this country. How long will it take for you to realize that nothing but debt "trickles down" from the super-rich?    The policies McCain espouses have contributed to the rapid disappearance of the middle class, and the concentration of most wealth in a very few hands.    Obama wants to reverse that trend.    Why do you hate the middle class? Why do you hate America?|`|aXSjRwEVaa	If McCain wins, you won't even have a country to be employed in.  The fact is that the vast majority of small businesses earn less than $250,000 per year.  Those that earn higher than that won't have any trouble paying a fair tax rate.    It is certainly worth it.    Trickle up economics works much better than trickle down economics.|`|AA10576174	America is going on a hope and a dream this election.

I know a guy that says he will close his company of 236 employees in Montana if Obama wins.|`|xZy05taKaa	Me to  Also what happens if anyone actually manages to use their heads or work with actual ambition and does get to own a 4 bedroom home with 2 $1/2 baths? Obama will add a tax to every home over 2300 Square feet. and that is NOT very big at all. With an additional tax, it will cost more to live in, and its value will be less because of that. Meaning that government is taking away the value of homes by putting a federal tax on them in addition to local real estate taxes.  So there will be no incentive will there?  As someone so elequantly put it:  2008 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE COMPARISON    ISSUE    Favors new drilling offshore US:  JOHN McCAIN - Yes  BARAK OBAMA - No    Will appoint judges who interpret the law, not make it:  JOHN McCAIN - Yes  BARAK OBAMA - No    Served in the US Armed Forces:  JOHN McCAIN - Yes  BARAK OBAMA - No    Amount of time served in the US Senate:  JOHN McCAIN - 22 YEARS  BARAK OBAMA - 173 DAYS    Will institute a socialized national health care plan:  JOHN McCAIN - No  BARAK OBAMA - Yes    Supports abortion throughout the pregnancy:  JOHN McCAIN - No  BARAK OBAMA - Yes    Would pull troops out of Iraq immediately:  JOHN McCAIN - No  BARAK OBAMA - Yes    Supports gun ownership rights:  JOHN McCAIN - Yes  BARAK OBAMA - No    Supports homosexual marriage:  JOHN McCAIN - No  BARAK OBAMA - Yes    Proposed programs will mean a huge tax increase:  JOHN McCAIN - No  BARAK OBAMA - Yes    Voted against making English the official language:  JOHN McCAIN - No  BARAK OBAMA - Yes    Voted to give Social Security benefits to illegals:  JOHN McCAIN - No  BARAK OBAMA - Yes    CAPITAL GAINS TAX  MCCAIN  0% on home sales up to $500,000 per home (couples). McCain does not propose any change in existing home sales income tax.    OBAMA  28% on profit from ALL home sales. (How does this affect you? If you sell your home and make a profit, you will pay 28% of your gain on taxes. If you are heading toward retirement and would like to down-size your home or move into a retirement community, 28% of the money you make from your home will go to taxes. This proposal will adversely affect the elderly who are counting on the income from their homes as part of their retirement income.)    DIVIDEND TAX  MCCAIN  15% (no change)    OBAMA  39.6% - (How will this affect you? If you have any money invested in stock market, IRA, mutual funds, college funds, life insurance, retirement accounts, or anything that pays or reinvests dividends, you will now be paying nearly 40% of the money earned on taxes if Obama becomes president. The experts predict that 'Higher tax rates on dividends and capital gains would crash the stock market, yet do absolutely nothing to cut the deficit.')    INCOME TAX  MCCAIN  (no changes)    Single making 30K - tax $4,500  Single making 50K - tax $12,500  Single making 75K - tax $18,750  Married making 60K- tax $9,000  Married making 75K - tax $18,750  Married making 125K - tax $31,250    OBAMA (reversion to pre-Bush tax cuts)  Single making 30K - tax $8,400  Single making 50K - tax $14,000  Single making 75K - tax $23,250  Married making 60K - tax $16,800  Married making 75K - tax $21,000  Married making 125K - tax $38,750    INHERITANCE TAX  MCCAIN  - 0% (No change, Bush repealed this tax)    OBAMA  Restore the inheritance tax . How does it affect you? 50% taxes on your estate after you die. The family farm will have to be divided in half to pay this tax.  The largest transfer of wealth will be in the next 20-30 years. $40-50 Trillion dollars is expected to change hands.    NEW TAXES PROPOSED BY OBAMA  New government taxes proposed on homes that are more than 2400 square feet. New gasoline taxes, New taxes on natural resources consumption (heating gas, water, electricity) New taxes on retirement accounts, New taxes to pay for socialized medicine.|`|JseyoIfLaa	Yes I believe that it is worth it.

People act like it's half their income or something.      3% of say $50,000 (so making $300,000) =  $1500  That is not that much to someone making $300,000.. Come on.|`|pdvqX3R6aa	is the extra 3% really gonna be that bad for you.|`|D69XI2LLaa	$2000? I did the calculations and Obama would save me a couple hundred total.

People who earn just $25,000 a year will feel the crunch of being taxed the 3% more, not the wealthy.     Obama also mentions tax credits for the 'small businesses'. Look into them, many people will benefit from them.     McCain wants to reward the companies that ship their jobs overseas so they can hire Chinese people to work for $1.00 a day and keep all their profits and get richer. Obama wants to keep jobs here, which is why many will benefit from his tax credits for keeping the jobs in the US,     Let me ask you, when is the last time you can say you saw 'Made in the USA' on any item you may have purchased lately? Mine always seem to say 'Made in India' 'Made in China' 'Made in Taiwan' 'Made in Indonesia'.    Also anytime you'd have to call any type of Tech support or customer service don't you always end up talking to some guy with a middle eastern accent? I'm not discriminating but that there goes to show you where the friggen jobs went. Because the CEO's get rich paying diddly to people in foreign countries. Now if they actually kept the jobs in the US they would be crying because they'd actually have to pay their employees the benefits they DESERVE and the wages they NEED to live.  They are GREEDY!|`|pv8tpMY7aa	Good for you,,,I dont blame ya|`|Jx3FmfY3aa	I'm guessing those 25 employees have no real purpose then.

I think you're either full of bull or a jerk for manipulating your employees like that.|`|gHos2fyHaa	That's really stupid on your part.  You would cut jobs and cancel contracts so you won't make over $250,000.  You are putting limits on your own success.  Doesn't sound very business savvy to me.  Or could you be one of those people who make up things on Y!A just to make a point.........hmmmmm|`|LEdYXPn1aa	I hope you're telling the truth so your employees can sue you for your $250k business.  Then you wouldn't have to worry about getting taxed.  Do some research.  Small businesses will recieve tax breaks not tax increases.|`|yTklCaALaa	Some boss you are. Nothing like putting fear into people to vote the way you do...sounds like Bush in 2004.  I wouldn't want to work for a man like you anyway.  These are the people that got you your $250,000. Your greed is showing just like the the wall street monsters that got us into this mess in the first place!!|`|LsXm4wuXaa	Look, a 4% increase in taxes isnt going to cripple the economy. That is a rediculous mindset to be in. And we're talking about a tax on $250,000 PROFIT. NOT GROSS INCOME. So the 250,000 that will be taxed 4% is after salary expense, supplies, utilities, and all other expenses to the business. So that is 250,000 that the store owner gets to put in his pocket. The owner of the business will walk away with $240,000 in his pocket instead of $250,000. IMO that isnt a big loss at all, and certaintly wouldnt affect jobs, because salary expense is deductable to the company.|`|muAEP3bGaa	Great question.  No, it isn't worth it for the middle class.  But liberal Democrats ("socialists") are experts are class warfare.  Don't forget his intent to lift the cap on the amount of income subject to the social security (payroll) tax and to raise the capital gains and dividend taxes. Plus, his reversing of the Bush tax cuts for those making $250,000 or more affects not only you (your business) but also those of your customers and suppliers (and partners, if applicable).  Many file as sub-chapter S corporations and will be caught in the Obama trap.  And the flight to corporate tax havens like Ireland will accelerate.    Check out the three links below.  The first two are applicable to your question; I would recommend sharing the third with friends and family to get the word out before it's too late.    Thank you for your time.|`|fu6uTY1yaa	I believe many more jobs are in jeopardy than people believe.  I'm an HR consultant and ALL of my accounts are developing plans for major lay-offs in the even that Obama wins.    It is what it is.  It seems that AMericans like to shoot themselves in the foot.  First they voted in Bush for two-terms and now it seems they will votes in the candidate who is truly most like him -- Obama.    It's crazy stupid.  |`|ycj8NdoYaa	So you have effectively blackmailed your employees into voting for McCain because you don't understand the tax issue.

He says he is a Christan man, well does he know that you shall not judge only I the Judge may judge. He forgot about that one. As for the Partial Abortion Procedure. Yes it is not a nice procedure but he voted on it do to the fact there are women out there that have complications and if they go through with the pregnancy they will die. He did vote against it for that single reason. He asked them to put a claws in that aloud for this one reason and they said either vote for it or against it and he voted for it. He said he doesn't believe in abortion or same sex marriage but he can not judge someone how makes a decision that he finds it morally wrong.    This man is a moron and needs for read his bible a little more. As for the church he attended for the last 20 years. He has no control over what someone Else believes or says. It didn't come from his mouth so what is the issue.     Reverend write is not the only one that thinks bush flow those planes into that building or  that maybe america finally got what they were doing to other countries for years.     So this man wants to vote for a government that wants more war and not for a government that does not pass judgement? Sound strange and hypocritical.    |`|UavQy57Yaa	Doesn't the bible say also:    Judge not least ye be judged, and also, Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.    Seems to me you are judging and casting stones. Shame on you for not following your Christian beliefs.|`|6y334NgTaa	I read this article and none of these points will influence my decision.  You do not need to enact laws to tell me abortion is a horrible practice.  Unfortunatly horrible things can happen (rape, incest, rare medical conditions that can put mother or child in danger)...  I trust people and i feel we can make up our own minds.  Before making any decision to abort I believe women should consult their partners, families, clergy, doctors... but never politicians. I do not think our politicians should be telling us what to do with our families.  I do not believe Obama practices abortion.    I believe in separation of church and state and I believe someone's religion is a private matter. Honestly I do have some concerns with Obama's choice in religious practice.  And I have similar concerns about Sarah Palin's practices as well.  But I do not think it will hinder either of their polical performance... Again I feel religion is a private matter and does not reflect largely on anyone's character.

Saudi isnt a threat. |`|s68u1i5Yaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDDFlmoKh...    CIA Sponsored Terrorism from 1953-Present    America itself is a terrrorist country.

Why bomb an entire nation for the transgressions of a few fanatics?|`|iVVUgIm3aa	No way.|`|16mZNrkFaa	Saudi Arabia had no connection with 9/11, just because some of the hijackers were Saudis and the leader of Al-Qaeda is a Saudi royal family.    Little do people remember that Saudi Arabia exiled Osama in 1994, when he began a war on the royal family.    And why bomb Saudi Arabia just because of a few hijackers origins. It seems by watching documentaries that these hijackers learnt to fly planes in Germany, so let's bomb Germany or is that irrational.    Saudi Arabia has been one of the U.S.A and wests allies for over 60  years and is currently the strongest Muslim ally.    By attacking Saudi Arabia will justify to the hardline Islamists that this is a war on Islam, and billions of Muslims will overpower western nations.     Where is the sense, or rational thinking.    On those terms, why did you invade Afghanistan. The country was and still is at war with its self. It had no idea about Al-Qaeda. The U.S.A should have sent special forces to track down Al-Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan and did not need to invade two countries that has made the world unstable.    What next, after Saudi Arabia then Iran then North Korea, does the western killing never end?
AA11485286	The greatest amount of taxes is paid by the middle and lower middle class of which is slowly becoming extinct due to the disparity between the income classes!!!  Economists indicate it may not be too long before the economic classes consist of only the upper and low/impoverished classes when advantage remains with the wealthy.  Republicans are notorious for campaigning for reduced or no tax increase, but that is only for corporate and wealthy America (e.g., record profits for oil companies, and tax loop-holes for those who are afforded major deductions at tax time)!!!  Republicans continue to promote the no tax increase scenario, but taxes continue being deducted in our household at an increasing rate.  Plus, the GOP continues to design its economic platform around the old Reagan "trickle-down" taxation proposal where the wealthy (5% of Americans) and corporations receive the benefits of reduced taxation with the remainder of working, middle class Americans benefiting by way of the creation of more/new jobs.  It's hard to imagine that the uneducated, hard working middle class has yet to catch on to Republican campaign tactics and methods of managing business for its citizens!!!  You'd think that they would want less desparity and more economic fairness!!!|`|AA11746917	He expects them to pay taxes, he just isn't going to raise taxes. |`|vZy28Yqjaa	He's going to tax your health insurance premiums for the first time in history.|`|wgKti8vJaa	He was hoping the illegal immigrants would pay those taxes, but now his plan is going to fall because they are being deported....lol    Illegal Immigrants pay BILLIONS in taxes.  http://www.azcentral.com/business/articl...|`|DypTl9Zdaa	to Mike F:  At least he isn't going to tax water, electricity, gasoline, death, inheritance, coffee, and just about everything else.

If it is someone that is willing to work with all parties, and is willing to make compromises, yes.    If it is someone who stands firm on their platform, then my answer is no.

Like Nader, Barr or whoever, they run for president, even if they win, they have to work with both Democrats or Republicans which make this President useless without vast support.    Third parties should build from ground up.  then It may be better off.    Look at the debates, only two parties, even though they have third parties debate some time, but not known and not too many people know about their ideas and so on.    Voting third party in this case is as pointless as both major parties.|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	I think people need to get rid of the labels democrat adn republic and actually listen to the issues at hand and the candidates position on it....that would be the only way to actually get the best person for the job...it should also be held without seeing what the person looks like to avoid prejudice!  |`|tiGpryHiaa	no doubt|`|3OBmjBsNaa	Yes.  YES!!!  But how do we break the power of the two parties?  They have carefully crafted an environment to eliminate any possibility of the rise of a third party.      I attended a discussion between two former heads of the RNC and DNC.  They said about presidential elections:    1.  40+% of the US will blindly vote for a GOP candidate,  40+% blindly for any Dem candidate -- no exceptions.  2.  4% of US will never vote Dem or GOP no matter what.  3.  Because of this (see 1 & 2 above), all campaigns are written to target tiny segments of the population -- if either party can effectively secure less than 6% of the population they will win.      Friends in politics tellm me my data is old.  Campaigns are so sophisticated that the target is down to about 2%.  Is your party (insert GOP or Dem here) interested in you or the wellbeing of the country?  Does it believe in the principles they espouse from the podium?  No way.  They only care about winning.  Hence:  The Corporation for Presidential debates -- formed to prevent 3rd party candidates from participating in presidential debates.  Both parties are contractually bound to it, barring them from interaction with third party candidates.    Do we need a viable third party?  Yes.  Otherwise what is in the best interests of the country as a whole will never be represented.|`|LXdZrbf9aa	Probably... but until we get a good candidate to represent another party.... VOTE McCain|`|IXSnoEHoaa	No. The third party candidates are run with Republican money.    John McCain will send even more jobs overseas. He says hell sign a free trade deal with any country.

If you answer my question you will answer your own question: because he was born a citizen.    Obama 2008|`|s1zitZMOaa	Only one person has answered this question correctly and they were given a thumbs down. I guess people don't actually care about facts, they just care about slinging mud.     1. Obama was born in Hawaii, not Kenya. (1)    2. The US Constitution states in Article II, Section 1, Clause 5,   "No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States." (2)    3. A natural born citizen is defined this way:       *  Anyone born inside the United States      * Any Indian or Eskimo born in the United States, provided being a citizen of the U.S. does not impair the person's status as a citizen of the tribe      * Any one born outside the United States, both of whose parents are citizens of the U.S., as long as one parent has lived in the U.S.      * Any one born outside the United States, if one parent is a citizen and lived in the U.S. for at least one year and the other parent is a U.S. national      * Any one born in a U.S. possession, if one parent is a citizen and lived in the U.S. for at least one year      * Any one found in the U.S. under the age of five, whose parentage cannot be determined, as long as proof of non-citizenship is not provided by age 21      * Any one born outside the United States, if one parent is an alien and as long as the other parent is a citizen of the U.S. who lived in the U.S. for at least five years (with military and diplomatic service included in this time)      * A final, historical condition: a person born before 5/24/1934 of an alien father and a U.S. citizen mother who has lived in the U.S.  (3)    Both Obama and McCain fit the definition of a Natural born citizen. This is a question that could be answered by a 5th grader. |`|aFVzMM5laa	Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, not Kenya. His father is Kenyan. Obama has dual citizenship in the U.S. and Kenya.|`|z9UAnf3Waa	Because he has lied to the American people.  He is not eligible and has failed to prove that he is.    Here is evidence that his Hawaiian BC is a forgery.  http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas...    Everything you say is true.  Obama refuses to provide the proof and we, as true US citizens, will be defrauded by his acts.  He keeps stalling for time.    I think it will be a remarkable thing if the judge rules against him a day before the election.  He will have to be removed from the ballot and the Dems will not be able to do a thing about it.  I keep praying . . .    McCain/Palin 2008|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	I'm afraid you have been misinformed. It is not a fact that he was born in Kenya. It is an unsupported allegation. The fact is that he was born in Hawaii. That makes him a natural born citizen. See how important it is to know the difference between facts and lies? |`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	Well, we don't exactly know, rumor has it he was born in Hawaii, BUT since he REFUSES to provide his embossed birth certificate (like all candidates are REQUIRED to by constitutional law), we really have no way of knowing.  His multitude of lawyers have filed a motion to hold off any compulsory action until AFTER the elections.  Interesting isn't it?  And if McCain was born in Panama, which I hadn't heard but could be a possibility, wasn't panama (at that time) a territory or colony of America much as Peurto Rico is today?  My issue is the arrogance that allows obama to say "you know what, I'm not gonna and you can't make me, so there".     |`|DjfJTNebaa	with Obama all things are possible, like tax refunds for those who don't pay taxes.|`|3eb0DIxGaa	Hawaii is not in Kenya.|`|swpCcJcPaa	He was born in Hawaii |`|GkShK7JZaa	Supposedly he was born in Hawaii, but nobody really knows for sure.

NlOtwCqgaa	The bible does not tell people how to vote.. it just doesn't.. the rest of this is my opinion.    "Should you just pick the best MORAL character?" No. This is a country, not a church.. and unlike many churches, the country has to be run in much the same way that businesses are run.  There are many people I would look to for spiritual guidance, but I would not trust them in a leadership position on anything except religion.  They are really smart, but would make horrible leaders, because they don't look at how things would be for the most people involved. They don't look at the big picture.. The president is faced with a lot of "wrong, and less wrong" decisions, neither decision is actually "right" so he has to pick the "less wrong" of the 2. (for instance.. is it better to make abortion illegal? because then you have more child abuse, child abandonedment, and more illegal abortions witch may kill or severely harm the mother, it looks simple on the surface, but it really isn't when the ramifications of the decision are looked at)    Is it biblical to vote? eh.. probably not.. people didn't vote in the bible.. God chose the king..   but then again, God actually "talked" to people at that time,     should christan woman vote? I think they should. We are no longer in a time when men rule the world, or when men who rule will automatically protect women.    The job of men used to be to protect women, but that isn't how things are any more (be that good or bad) so therefore women need to have the ability and the right to protect themselves.  They can't do that if they can't vote.  |`|qjH3Tigbaa	You can't relate Christians to voting--separation of church and state heloo|`|d3f5cd38d886f36de569939f133ea543aa	Christians-as with any other group-should vote according to their convictions.     The biggest impact the president has in regards to moral, social and cultural issues that concern most Christians is in the selection of LIFETIME appointments of Supreme Court Justices. The courts have made decisions on social and cultural issues such as abortion, prayer and religious displays in court houses and other public places, the death penalty and so on.    The big debate over Supreme Court Justices is in how the US Constitution is interpreted. Some justices tend to broadly and (arguably) create new rights, liberties and/or restrictions that aren't specifically stated in the Constitution. This is commonly referred to as "legislating from the bench" as it's elected legistlatures' job to make laws. The courts' ONLY function is to interpret those laws and the US Constitution-NOT to rewrite either.     The most notable current example is probably the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision. The Supreme Court decided that the states have no right to infringe on what some justices declared was a constitutionally protected right to abort their children prior to birth. Furthermore, the Supreme Court decision prohibits states from even restricting this new 'right' in most circumstances even to the point of usurping parental authority in the case of minors seeking to abort their unborn children. Many-if not most-Christians would probably consider this decision 'extreme' to say the least.    Another popular decision is the supposed 'wall of separation between church and state' which is not mentioned in the US Constitution.    Some obeservers expect at least 3 Supreme Court openings within the next president's first term. In addition, the president appoints lower court judges as well.     President's tend to nominate justices who share their values and politcal stances on major issues. Currently, the US Supreme Court is 'liberal leaning' by just only one justice. So this election could likely determine whether we have 'liberal' or 'conservative' Suprememe Court decisions for the forseable future.    There are very likely to be some major, serious issues of interest to Christians coming before the Supreme Court in the next several years. So form this perspective, a Christian would probably want to vote for a candidate in part on his prior voting history on issues related to social, cultural and religious issues such as gay rights for one example.    I know it's a very long answer, but I hope it helps!|`|N3S9S1joaa	Vote for Chuch Baldwin. Google his name.

Godly leaders    If you take a moment to look at the topics and where God stands on them, of the 2 candidates you have to vote McCain.

I am voting for him because he is an American hero, who has more years of experience than years Obama has been ALIVE.|`|umrXBkeMaa	I'm actually not voting "for" either one.    McCain is as much a Democrat as he is a Republican, probably the most bi-partisan candidate to come along in several decades.  I didn't vote for him in the primaries, and I don't relish the idea that if he wins we'll hear nothing but "it's McCain's fault" for 4 years while he continues to try to please everyone, Republican and Democrat alike.    But Obama is an extreme radical leftist.  He became a radical during college, and when he moved to Chicago he specifically sought out other radicals.  (HE sought and found Bill Ayres and Rev. Wright... it was not the other way around... because Ayres and Wright represented the extremist radical viewpoint that he was looking for.)  He is the extremist, hate-filled, destructive, me-generation, baby boomer, hippie radicals last chance at destroying our nation and remaking it in their socialist communist image of perfection.    So I'm really not voting FOR McCain as much as I will be voting AGAINST Obama.    Honestly, if Hillary was running, I would have probably voted FOR her.    HOWEVER, the constants attacks on Sarah Palin make me feel better about my vote for McCain.  The attacks are a bit overdone to the point of being ridiculous and disgusting.  It's not a sympathy vote, but one to SPITE the critics, who think they know so much better than me what's best for me.    |`|93QLogE1aa	If I were eligible to vote, I would certainly vote for Barack Obama, not because he is black, but because he solely knows what is best for America. He is trustworthy, brilliant, and extremely qualified to be America's future presdient. Joe Biden, along with Barack Obama, clearly know whats best for our current generation, and these two individuals will hopefully create great success for future generations to come. John McCain and Sarah Palin, on the other hand, are not only ignorant to what is going on in the country, but they are not prepared to handle future disputes. We need change.|`|bRBoPqRuaa	I'm voting for obama because america can't afford another bush. I do have some worries that blacks will get higher treatment then other races though. The war needs to end. Gas prices need to go down and rich people need to stop getting away with everything|`|2144f528ae3bca4a2317f3f6bc92cbd4aa	I am voting for Barack Obama, for a few reasons.  First off, he's the only candidate that has expressed the desire to take the country in a direction that is more closely aligned with what the country needs, which is a fair tax plan, healthcare for all, education being accessible to all and most importantly, the fair treatment of all citizens under the Constitution.  Also, righting the course of the last 8 years to be inline with the rest of the planet as opposed to doing things alone.  McCain cannot say that he's been an ardent supporter of Bush's policies all of this time.  Along those lines, McCain is planning to continue the tax breaks that Bush has given that needed it the least, and I wish someone would explain to me where that has helped anyone over the last 8 years.  If, you're a middle class family, the last 8 years have watched the value of your home dwindle, your savings disappear, your retirement be put off a little longer and the ovreall outlook is alot bleaker than it was back in 2000.  John McCain can proudly say that he was a party to the decisions that have bought us from a budget surplus to a HUGE budget deficit.    As for the war, I would like a leader that thinks abd takes into all accounts the options to address a national crisis or as is the case the on going wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I personally feel that McCain is still fighting in Vietnam.  Which leads me back to a point I made earlier.  To be a safer country in the world as it is today, we must gather the countries and be one with them.  The countries that don't get along with us, we need to be able to open a line of dialogue with them.  The old adage is "Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer".  Under Bush e've no idea what our enemies are plotting...Heck, we're creating them more and more each day......With the current adminsitration and the habits of McCain I just see more of he same and if anyone hasn't noticed, it hasn't and won't work.    Lastly, with McCain being in his 70's, I am ABSOLUTELY not comfortable with an ultra right wing Republican being in line for  President.  Palin must have some talent as she did earn the right to be Gov. of Alaska, but seriously does anyone feel at peace with the fact that she could God forbid be in charge of this country?    Oh, and one more thing, with the next President sits the shape of the Supreme Court.  Another Republican administration and I gaurantee that this country won't be recognizable in 20 years.  And, BTW, I am voting for him also because he's black.  Am I wrong, not after the points that I made, but also, there alot of white folks out there that believe in what he says but won't vote for him because of the same reason.|`|lTK0nlozaa	http://www.squidoo.com/dear_mr_president

Besides, I'd rather have Obama's "inexperience" with Biden's foreign policy expertise to back him up than John "100 years war" McCain and Sarah Palin. Man, if you want to talk about inexperience, take a look at Palin's track record. She just wants to kill all the fish and polar bears. Wtf.|`|5Ed4lozZaa	Obama.    - Pro choice  - Wants to raise minimum wage  - Pro death penalty  - Has a more proactive approach to alternative energy sources  - Will reform the "no child left behind" act  - Tax incentives for US based companies  - Tax breaks for low and middle class americans  - Fully supports stem cell research  - Supports giving medicare the ability to negotiate prescription drug prices  - Supports medical marijuana  - Good position on immigration (amnesty/ granting citizenship if they pay back taxes and learn english)  - Mandatory healthcare for all children and quality, accessible healthcare  |`|EbNKkc75aa	Have you ever seen the Southpark episode where the kids have to vote between a douche or a turd sandwich?

Yet we invade Iraq.    I think Obama is the only one who can handle these terrorists.|`|gSdeVUOTaa	Oh for crying out loud! No one has forgotten. And I'm sure Obama would deal far better than BushCo has.   The invasion/occupation of Iraq had nothing to do with spreading democracy. It is not a war. It had absolutely nothing to do with 9/11!|`|O95pKlPiaa	"incomprehensible"  I guess that is just cause you don't have a lot of education.

To this day Bin Laden and the Taliban are laughing at us - and McCain wants to continue this strategy.    Obama has suggested taking troops from Iraq and putting them back in Afghanistan to FIND BIN LADEN.    I think you are the one who forgot about 911 and bought Bush's Iraq ruse, hook, line and sinker.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	Actually, it is only Obama who has taken 9/11 seriously in that he will go after the perpetrator of this crime, Osama Bin Laden, even if he is hiding in Pakistan.    McCain on the other hand, wants to muck around in Iraq which has nothing to do with what happened on 9/11.    BTW, why are you trying to exploit the tragedy of 9/11 for political gain?|`|8RflQ9DVaa	No dear. I don't think any American that was here will ever forget 9/11.  No need to watch your youtube.    Do you have something besides manipulating teardrops to back up your claim about Obama?|`|AA11221077	I see so many of the people on here saying "I was in 4th grade on 9/11" or "I was in kindergarten on 9/11."

They've also forgotten (or are too young to know) that Bill Clinton was too busy playing "hide the cigar" to capture bin Laden when they had him in their sights.|`|L2QdPvSUaa	I can be assured that there are ordinary people all over the place represented by Bin Laden that hated US world hegemony all the crimes committed by the USA in this video was what led to Bin Laden's show.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3Os4bJn0...  In general, you Americans should blame your govt for acting like a complete moron over the last 60 years and ironically the US govt was the one that funded Bin Laden and the Taliban before they turned against the USA.    You measured the lives of civilians all over the world as worthless. Bin Laden did the same thing by declaring you guys infidel with his show.|`|ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	Whatever...how anyone thinks McCain could deal is incomprehensible to me...so...where does that leave us?  How did Bush do?  Is Al Qaeda done for? (remember...that's who attacked us...NOT Saddam), is Osama in custody or dead?  (remember...he's wanted dead or alive), are the Taliban running scared? (government reports now say Al Qaeda and Taliban are as strong or stronger than they were on 9.11).    Bush hasn't done crap going after the real terrorists that attacked us.  He started a war on false pretense - heck some parts of Al Qaeda just endorsed McCain for president as they see him as offering more opportunities to kill Americans.      Heck...McCain said he'd follow Bin Laden into the 'gates of hell'...I guess that doesn't include Pakistan.|`|eiGUOeleaa	Ohh, you mean the one that happened 7 years ago?.. heres a little note for you.    Pearl harbor december 7, 1941 end of world war 2, may 1945.   Elapsed time, 3.5 years.      September 11th, 2001 end of the war on terrorism, pending.   elapsed time, 7.1 years.    Isn't it about time we stop this $$$$?    Skierbreezer, 9/11 was the first foreign attack on american soil since pearl harbor, the fact we haven't been attacked again since 2001 really doesn't surprise me.|`|0686e457a634ce1e335c836cdfa1f056aa	I don't need to watch your video because I was living in NYC at the time and working 5 blocks from Ground Zero, so I watched it live.    I really hate  it when people politicize 9/11 and try to use it to suggest that either candidate would be incapable of dealing with terrorism.    Retired 4-Star General Colin Powell, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary of State under George W. Bush supports Obama in this election, so it stands to reason that he thinks Obama can deal with terrorism effectively.    I don't think anyone on Yahoo Answers knows more about fighting or winning wars or about presidential politics than Colin Powell.|`|3ffb3b89c4d7e5f341def84b65cd6d10aa	lets see who handled the economic crisis better?  ...Mr "i am suspending my campaign and going straight to DC....in 22 hours of-course....i mean i have to let ever one know, right?"   or   Obama who took is as just another bump in the road and took his time thinking about his options?|`|AA10251268	No, I have not forgotten - I lived in DC at the time and have friends who were at work in the Pentagon that day (all of whom were OK, fortunately).

Obama freaking scares me- he would be a disaster.     *Why do you people think the middle east is funding his campaign?   Why don't enough people appreciate the fact that since 9/11, we have not been attacked? Stop being so naive to real word terrorism that happens all around us and is kept, for our own good, top secret. I'm really biting my tongue here..

He has been serving his country all of his life.  He has bleed for his country and lost his freedom for his country as a POW.  What has Obama done?  None of the above.  Obama has no experience and has convened with marxist radicals in his past and present since Acorn was founded by one and Obama and his friends still support that corrupt organization.  Now I gather for some reason Obama refuses to produce a document that any of us would be forced to produce if questioned by INS.  Why?|`|gMjgHYT6aa	Don't worry, nobody believes that Obama is anything but a secularist. No Christian would ever condone partial-birth abortions or vote against a law requiring that a child born alive during a "botched" abortion shall have medical care and be afforded the rights of personhood.     Obama said it was "above his paygrade" to make a determination of when a human being becomes a person who enjoys the protection under the US Constitution. No Christian has that difficulty.     Obama is also no Muslim, but he used to be one. There is no denying that he attended a Muslim school while a citizen of Indonesia.     Interestingly enough, at the time he was a citizen of Indonesia, they did not allow dual citizenship, or allow non-citizens to live in the country (which was at war at the time).     Obama's paternal grandmother remembers fondly the birth of Obama in Kenya, the son of a Kenyan National. To date, Obama has not submitted his birth certificate and is being sued to prove he is a natual-born citizen as required under the US Constitution.     What does he have to hide?     McCain was accused of the same thing, being born in the Panama Canal Zone, and he quickly provided documentation that his birth took place in a US military installation and was born to an American father.     Until Obama provides proof, these charges cannot be disputed, though I'm sure many will attempt to do so by calling me names.     Nope, Obama is no Muslim.     He's not an American either.

They will not spend a great deal of money unless there is a good chance of that money being returned and grown at a later date. Middle class people languish in their economic station because they are the largest group of credit users. Someone making a quarter million annually isn't going to be paying 15% interest on a 52" flatscreen TV, but someone who makes 50k a year sure will!    Given that the middle class is the group that puts money in with little to no expectation of return on investment, they put the most money into the economy. The theory is that if these people have more disposable income they will be more likely to spend it. How that theory will work out in practice has yet to be seen because it has never been stated so blatantly before, but the basic system worked well for shrinking the national debt and building a surplus during the Clinton years. We'll see how Obama's super-specific plan works out.     The only certainty in this mess is that it is a very interesting time to be an economist.|`|SXeEvt9Qaa	think the opposite of the trickle down theory.|`|5ynxAT2Paa	I don't have an economic background, but I know that there is no such thing.

They then take their money, and unlike all past history has indicated, rather then spend that money on themselves, or saving it, they reinvest in their company's and hire more workers. Now these new workers can take advantage of their awesome new income, because evil government isnt' taxing them into submission.       Bottom up economics is kind of crazy. It states that if the people who buy things have more money to spend, they will spend it on things. Since their day to day life revolves around buying things to survive, and because they make up a much larger percentage of the population, the economy grows.       Look up unemployment statistics for Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II, if you want some laughs. |`|NlOtwCqgaa	money is given to regular people... the people purchase goods or services from the businesses, who then reinvest their profits into the business.    This also gives more control to the consumer, since only the businesses who offer things that are needed by the public will get the bulk of the profits, which is what the free market is supposed to be. |`|45ab0bea68cbc724ceec9b426a6147b3aa	It's like repairing and Old house.

BUT unless you check the foundation make sure it is stable and free of any major damages such as leaks and cracks  your just wasting your money and time. In order to build you have to start from the bottom. The bible even tells us to build on a solid foundation.|`|R9D2uD6jaa	take the wieght off the middle class and give them tax breaks so they have some more money that they can use for spending and if everyone goes out spending it will help business =]|`|110wHOnqaa	If poor people do not have any money, the economy tanks.  Rich people hoard money.  Poor people, because of their scarcity of resources, purchase goods.  Purchasing goods keep people working.  There is no need for people at your local grocery store, if no one has any money to buy groceries.  Hence people are then laid off, it's really a vicious cycle.    That's as plain as I can make it.|`|pRIDFA5Caa	he wants our economy to hit bottom???|`|P9zMowzTaa	People spend money at companies, so those companies need to hire more employees. When people get hired and have a job, they have more money, which they can then use to buy things from companies...who then have to hire more employees.    It's like supply and demand for jobs. The more business a company receives, the more jobs they need to fill.     ADD: The idea of trickle-down economics is that you give the corporation tax breaks and they will be able to cut prices. But in reality, when you give the money to the corportion rather than to the people, that corporation is just going to keep the money, probably giving it out to their CEO's. Look at what AIG did with the bailout...they used it buy vacations for their executives. But when you put the money in the hands of the workers, it spreads around the economy. It doesn't just stay with one company, it goes to several (ie, families buy food, clothes AND toys and spend their money at different stores, meaning more stores can profit from an increase in sales).    ADD: Remember Bush's economic stimulus checks? By giving people those checks, he was attempting to jump-start the economy via bottom-up economics. Sadly, the stimulus check was so little, and the economy is in such a mess as it is, that people chose to use the checks to pay off debts and save for retirement. It's going to take more than just switching to bottom-up economics to help the economy, but I can tell you what ISN'T helping: giving money directly to big businesses.     If you tax companies more, they will reflect that tax into their product by increasing prices. But if you give them tax cuts, they will keep the money for themselves rather than using it to lower prices. The best thing would be to focus on the middle class, and alleviating the pressure of the middle class. Things like middle class tax-cuts, socialized health insurance, etc are things that can help tremendously to alleviate the pressures put on the middle class. And then that middle class will be able to spend a little more than they could before, and put money back into the corporations to increase job availablity.  That's the idea.|`|CzNe9yooaa	By lowering the financial burden on the middle class & below by cutting taxes, not raising taxes and providing different forms of aid, especially medical.  Right now the middle class holds so much of the financial and economic burden, by alleviating some of that, people will be able to live, pay bills, purchase homes/cars, and afford extras.

With supply side you encourage businesses to grow and thus employ. people have jobs and grow more business which produces more tax income from employees and business. With demand side, you tax the businesses. Give the money to people not producing anything but with government strings attached. Now we have more demand then the businesses can produce because they don't have the money to reinvest and the price of products go up (inflation) it's not growth but inflation and sixty years of history showing failed economic policy(USSR) which collapsed from within due to no economic growth.

That number is an inflated estimate of the very top tax rate, and it doesn't represent what Obama has proposed.        * That false figure includes an increased Social Security tax rate that Obama doesn't support, plus the state income tax rate paid by people making more than a million dollars a year in California.        * One ad implies that regular folks just trying to make it as entrepreneurs would be hit with such a rate.

Finances. The Economy. Wall Street. Pensions. Money. Retirement. Value of Dollar. Oil Prices. Inflation. Hyper Inflation. Deflation. Government bailout bills. Food prices. The subprime mortgage crisis. The credit crunch crisis. Price control. Government regulations. FEMA. The IRS. Department of Homeland Security. Bank runs. Government buying up banks. More difficulties with the economy. Iraq War. Massive deficits. Weimar hyper-inflation. The Federal Reserve. Legal plunder.     All of those words, they all leave indigestion and ulcers in the pit of Americans stomachs.     Why is the DOW Jones getting slammed?     Why are Americans concerned about a depression?     Where are all the jobs?     Why is unemployment rising to the highest levels in the past 40 years?    Why is Bill Gates predicting unemployment rates of over 9% in the near future?     Americans are asking questions. Deep questions. Questions that neither Barrack Obama or John McCain are not answering.     Why is the Federal Reserve, a private banking institution, even in existence?     How much money in debt and credit is actually out there ?     Why is the International Monetary Fund in existence?     Who controls it?     Is the United Nations policies really in the best interest of independent sovereign nations?     Whats going on with AIG executives?    Why are banks failing?     What leads to economic collapse?     How is our government going to get us back in the black after years and years of lying to the American public?     Is it really going to take $20 to buy a loaf of bread in the next 6 months?     Why did George Bush suspend Habeous Corpus?     That is the mood of America right now. And - its not pretty. People are, for lack of better words, PISSED OFF! Thats right, people are pissed off. Theyre disillusioned and upset at the system.     How else can you explain Ron Pauls Campaign for Liberty convention drawing a larger crowd than the Republican National Convention?     How else can you explain the massive amounts of emails and FAXs that attacked Senators and State Representatives for the $850 billion bailout bill?     Americans want peace, freedom and prosperity - and they know they cant have it with the current system in place. Heck, the national debt is so bad, it would take over $25,000 per man, woman and child just to pay off the $10 trillion plus dollars outstanding.     Did you know that this country loses over $1.25 billion dollars per day?!? Imagine if your company was taking those types of losses! So, how can our government do that?     Americans dont believe either of the mainstream media candidates. Neither is offering any solutions to the problems. Both of them are leading us to more government regulation and control. The deeper and deeper in debt we become, the more and more the federal government spreads its tentacles of power and control.     What America wants what America NEEDS is truth. Pure simple truths. Lets fix our problems, take our lumps and move forward. No more suppressed civil liberties and lawlessness from our leaders. Of course, if America had listened to Ron Paul earlier and made the proper adjustments, many of the current worries and frustrations we have could have been fixed. But, in our blind and deceived eyes, we look towards a new president, neither of whom are willing to change the monetary system and expect different results. Ridiculous. Ron Paul has answers for the economic woes America is facing...  Allison Kugel, Senior Editor of PR.com, asks Ron Paul this question: Do you think that either Barack Obama or John McCain has what it takes to get us back into the black, financially?    Ron Paul: I dont think they even have a desire to do that, because people now dont think you should ever balance your budget in times like this. They dont even pretend to do that. Republicans are sort of like, what Dick Cheney said not too many years ago. He said, Well, we dont have to worry about deficits. Ronald Reagan taught us to live with a deficit. Conservative supply-siders think the deficits dont matter all that much and liberals never care. So, no, neither one of them has a desire to, nor would they know how to do it, because they both endorse this empire we are operating around the world. Its the empire thats bringing us to our knees and if we dont address that theres no way we can solve our problems.     Thats pretty distinct. Thats a direct answer to an honest question. Why cant we have more Ron Paul representatives out there?    http://www.campaignforliberty.org/|`|AA12358300	Yes, before the election  No, after the election    the small change may cost you your job!|`|t0gChuAUaa	If you make over $200k a year, then yeah.

McCain picked Palin as his VP, so he worries me about who he would pick in the top positions in Washington D.C. Obama already has a short list of the best and brightest to be in his cabinet and administration, including Rubin or Sumner for US Treasurer. Obama has plenty of contacts with Ivy League professors, and Obama would assemble a better administration and cabinet than McCain. And Obama, being a lawyer, should have a better idea and understanding who to pick to fill the expected seats in the US Supreme Court.|`|ZcaC37sZaa	McCain, not the socialist child killer.|`|QzOCkKGjaa	What if things were switched around? Think about it. Would the  country's collective point of view be different? Could racism be this  culprit????  [This most certainly must be a rhetorical question!]    What if the Obamas had paraded five children across the stage,  following the debate, including a three month-old infant and an unwed,  pregnant teenage daughter?    What if John McCain was a former president of the Harvard Law Review?    What if Barack Obama finished fifth from the bottom of his college  graduating class?    What if McCain had only married once, and Obama was a divorcee?    What if Obama had met his second wife in a bar and had a long affair  while he was still married?    What if Michelle Obama was the wife who not only became addicted to  pain killers but also acquired them illegally through her charitable  organization?    What if Cindy McCain graduated from Harvard?    What if Obama had been a member of the Keating Five? (The Keating Five  were five United States Senators accused of corruption in 1989,  igniting a major political scandal as part of the larger  Savings and Loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s.)    What if Obama couldn't read from a teleprompter?    What if Obama was the one who had military experience that included  discipline problems and a record of crashing seven planes?    What if Obama was the one who was known to publicly display  a serious  anger management problem?    What if Michelle Obama's family had made their money from beer distribution?    You could easily add to this list. If these questions reflected a  reality, if the tables were turned, do you really believe the election  numbers would be as close as  they are?    This is what racism does. It covers up, rationalizes and minimizes  qualities in one candidate and emphasizes negative characteristics in  another when there is a color difference.    And, think of this - the candidates' educational backgrounds:    Barack Obama:  Columbia University - B.A. Political Science with a specialization in  International Relations.  Harvard - Juris Doctor (J.D.) Magna *** Laude    Joseph Biden:  University of Delaware - B.A. in History and B.A. in Political Science.  Syracuse University College of Law - Juris Doctor (J.D.)    John McCain:  United States Naval Academy - Class rank: 894 of 899    Sarah Palin: Hawaii Pacific University - 1 semester  North Idaho College - 2 semesters - general study  University of Idaho - 2 semesters - journalism  Matanuska-Susitna College - 1 semester  University of Idaho - 3 semesters - B.A. in Journalism    Education isn't everything, but this is about the two highest offices  in the land as well as our standing in the world.

McCain will do anything or say anything to try to get elected. Choosing Palin is a great example of his inability to make logical desisions. His whole campaign is to smear Obama rather than talk about issues that matter. Why? Because he doesn't want you to know what he really thinks or what his intentions are. Palin is surrounded by scandals and corruption. There is no logic to her popularity beside being a woman and a soccer mom. She should be doing jail time for her shady expense write offs and lack of ethics.    To me it's hypocritical to say a woman doesn't have the right to choose,  but we have the right to go to war and kill whoever we want, wherever we want at the tax payers expense. And if you have a complication from pregnancy that will take your life or you were raped by a convict and don't have the means to support a child, too bad. Isn't Bush a baby killer? In what way have Americans benefited from the war? McCain has promised more wars worldwide.    And talk about redistributing the wealth - lets just suck the middle class dry by corrupting Wall Street and the housing industry and reward the criminals with millions and billions of dollars. I've been punished thousands of dollars for investing into my retirement. This hasn't just screwed over Americans, but the world economy.    Anyone with an open mind can see the direction this country has gone over the last 8 years and is ready for change - not just lip service from another corrupt republican who intends to screw us over further.|`|oO5SQzgAaa	mccain. obama supports should all  be executed.|`|i5HaqMgjaa	McCAIN|`|YPvyvDzQaa	McCain, because I want to continue to live in a free society and pay fair taxes.|`|g0G54QSiaa	PARIS HILTON FOR PREZ!|`|fJFcIu5Yaa	Obama|`|rBsJVfauaa	McCain because I'm smarter than a Democrat!

McCain is always backsliding and he is very inconsistent. His choice in running mate has made A LOT of people, including people who current work for Bush, to question his judgement and back Obama. Palin has a very shady past and is not ready to hold the position of president and as VP thats what her job is.    McCain's campaign has been all over the place. He is so desperate that hs now stealing Obama's slogans like "change" and "we can't have 4 more years of G. Bush". Yet 6 months ago he proudly announced that he voted with him 90% of the time. He is simply all over the place and seems very unstable. And God for bid something happen to him I fear Palin being the Commander in Chief.     And lastly, the republicans have a history of looking out for the rich...during the Bush administration we saw HUGE tax cuts for the rich and nothing for the middle class. And as Bill Clinton knew the US economy does well when the middle class does well as the middle class is who keeps this economy going. In addition, we have known there were no weapons of mass destruction to be found in the middle east for years and yet the republicans, including John McCain choose to continue to spend billions of dollars each month on this war. They are not even looking for Bin Laden...the ONLY reason this war is still going on is that some high level republicans get rich of it as they own the companies that keep the military supplied. McCain has made it clear that is all about war and more war! |`|tSSHhaJ7aa	I'm voting for McCain for a few reasons...  One - I'm a rather staunch Republican but before I even looked at their stand on the issues Obama made a speech that sounded so unlike a stereotypical politician, like it made me want to believe in the civility of the people in charge of our government again. It made me want to vote Democrat. I can't remember it word for word but I recall that he said both Republicans and Democrats needed to drop the differences and work together to achieve a better government for us all. And Obama already having this mass group of people already supporting him, I thought he had the wisdom and the means to actually achieve this "goal." However, after he acceptedd the nomination all I heard from his mouth was "Republican's fault for this!" and "Republican's fault for that!" And with that I realized even the great Obama can fall under the pressure of campaignadviserss if it's something as small as saying a few harmless words to hear the roar of crowds calling out your name. When he could've used that opportunity to unite the people, he threw it away.  Two - All this talk about taxes is complete bull. As the daughter of a supervising tax auditor,  I practically grew up in a state tax office. And I know that tax cuts for just one state are extremely few (non-existant) and VERY far between. All presidential nominees promise tax cuts. Look up the last time one of those tax cuts actually happened. I don't know who started the idea, but new presidents can not simply walk into 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and change everything about the tax laws we have now just because he was elected. It's called checks and ballances and it's there to make sure idiots who think they can change the world in 4 years won't screw up everything the founding fathers built this nation on.  Three -  Even if weapons of mass destruction were not found in Iraq, the suspicion of a lunatic like Saddam Hussein having them scares the absolute crap out of me. To me it would be much worse to let something like that just slide by than to "waste" our time and brave troops lives. I have bawled my eyes out at the meer thought of my bedroom not be a safe place to sleep at night because of a foreign invasion because of a bomb that we could've stopped but didn't. Despite all that, we are over there now. And the state that Iraq is in right now simply CANNOT be fixed within 2 years. Only a pampered elitist fool that has never truly experienced war or even cares to understand why it exists would think that it can be resolved so quickly.|`|kmu0fYXdaa	Your Mom.|`|dRCCHoBAaa	Chuck Norris|`|Pr9FWC0daa	McCain..Simple, he's smarter and has more knowledge on what he's doing!|`|i4dIVQQZaa	wish its still Bush!|`|xymv9ODUaa	obama all day   WE NEED A CHANGE!!!!!!!!!!|`|hFaPKK3jaa	mobama|`|Pti1VjSlaa	Who are these people of which you speak?

Oh by the way, just to set the record strait, Bush is a **** up but his corporate tax breaks helped to grow business and increase jobs.  This economic crisis that we are facing is partly or mostly the fault of the democratic congress and them lining their pockets with dirty money.  The office of president is not a dictatorship, others are involved in checking his power and making decisions too. Most of these people only "care" about your overall well-being when they need your votes.  They go to congress moderately wealthy and come out with millions in the bank.  Why are they in office again?  It is time that we get involved and hold them all responsible for their actions.  Ron Paul is the only one that wanted to get the Fed out of your life and give you back your freedom and prosperity.

Anyone who can actually say "George Bush was a good President" has some issues or is smoking something ...|`|8XJZ6jFZaa	a lot of racists want obama to fail.|`|AA11746917	Since when does one person run this country? The last time I checked, there was a balance of power in the US. The President can do nothing wothout the approval of Congress.So many people share in the blame, not just the President. To imply otherwise demostrates extreme ignorance. |`|Yhxc1gs7aa	Before they can watch anyone they have to put eye holes in their white hoods!|`|A4FDxOHjaa	Yep, I've been keeping score and noticed that 90% of it happened in the last 2 years with the Dem Congress.    Edit: LOL! So, stealing money from Social Security at the end of his administration is now a "Clinton surplus"?    Priceless!|`|4b23b573a989ee6fc5493b172ed8cc10aa	only one attack on US soil.  klinton had about six unanswered attacks on foreign soil.    high cost of war due to Democ rat resistance.  If dems would support the war it would be over by now.    unemployment rate 12% under Karter,  WOW that's good?    Dems caused the financial melt down.  Now they are in charge of fixing it.  That is stupid.  |`|f0f10549271cf5cb48ef2adc12f4ef13aa	It is so easy to blame the other guy isn't it?   Bush did what he could, he did not impose his beliefs but tried to be fair. I doubt Obama will do that. He did not start the deregulation, Clinton actually did that. and for the last 2 years the Democrats have ran the house. Why are you not calling them to the carpet? Why, because it does not apply to people like you. your the one Always pointing the finger and acting like your perfect. Those in glass houses should not throw stones. |`|Qp0ekslLaa	I LOVE your question,  it was what I have been thinking also, but you said it better than I could have!

Next....|`|241d5d00dbafe3f89d7c386072b59ba3aa	...and what about AIG?|`|313OagOsaa	They will attempt to attribute his erroneous decisions to him.    |`|ae54718496dc216dbde0762324f5ee8caa	Yep, and he saved America from more terrorism on our soil.    Let's watch Obama even closer, because he is the one the Terrorist Muslims wanted for our President, and they won the vote didn't they?|`|fL0wHyNNaa	The people who are all over Obama, are the same ones that say "What crimes?" when it comes to Bush.
JSjBecVHaa	No Frickin Way. He will increase spending and increase taxes across the board no matter what he says right now. He says what he says just to get elected. Once in office, look out!|`|CmG8oTH0aa	He will hatchet down, wait, he will scapel down, wait....    Yeah, he is gonna try.  But I don't think its that hard when you don't give 1 Trillion dollars away to failing banks.|`|AA10546011	No  no  no  no  no  no  no  no  no|`|5rXzu0IWaa	Yes, he will. He will also bring back Paygo which took us from deficit spending to a surplus over Bill Clinton's term. It will hurt, but we have to do it. The world is never going to loan us that much money again.    We have to do it without cutting funding for education, and social security.    We have to reduce Medicaid too. Not care - but spending.|`|8d143fb05958585be5a5b56c5cbc1006aa	Nothing!    People supporting Obama are supporting him and have no idea that his plan will run our economy into the ground. They refuse to be educated and all they can think about is "change" "change" but if they vote for Obama, change is all that they will have left in their pockets. |`|6iRrlATraa	No. Obama will increase spending exponentially if he is elected.|`|AA11859467	No.    Obama is a Socialist, not Democrat.    Hillary Clinton was the Democrat nominee.  Right out of the Karl Marx playbook Obama will increase government|`|AA12358300	sure after raising taxes|`|niD66AbCaa	No Obama is Higher spending, Higher taxes.

Somebody sooner or later will havet to pay down the 10.2 trillion dollar deficit.|`|wig4qCeJaa	Of course not, silly.    It has been proven time and again that more government spending is needed during bad economic times to help jump-start the economy.    No matter who is elected, there will be more government spending.  |`|52oGmHVlaa	government spending?????  Iraq?????  Whatever else the right can think of to kill people?????  |`|qAUcN7GXaa	No.|`|IRVeBwTmaa	HELL NO|`|Ixss2irhaa	"No", he will INCREASE government spending.|`|xwDtwVckaa	(in the words of Joe Biden)    Is this a joke?  Is this a real question?  I don't know who writes your questions for you.......|`|UJ3YWiZZaa	no|`|EqR9ajGgaa	no how do you think he will pay for all his stupid government programs   he will increase spending and raise taxes|`|lPmIdlWpaa	Neither canidadte will do that but one is being honest.   What McCain isn't telling you is that the republican economy plan has been based on "progressive" tax. That means they give tax cuts to the rich but end up making them pay a bigger share. In turn we all lose|`|RgMt0JkHaa	No that would not be possible under his economic plan. He plans to increase many social programs that the government runs so he will have to expand government to manage them. Additionally nationalizing health care will take at least as many people to run as does the Social Security Administration or the IRS. |`|PzkGIlPRaa	Well he will actually not increase, or decrease spending, first he will end the Iraq War, which will save the American people millions, but also put more money into the economy, social security, and healthcare. Basically when we had the great depression caused by the Republican President Herbert Hoover, a Democrat by the name of FDR, decieded that the government should have a greater role socially, thats what Obama has modeled his plan after, the Republicans have said that FDRs economic plans would hurt the economy just like they say Obamas will just don't listen to those people it's not just George Bush who has screwed our country, but the whole Republican party. |`|spjDVZgzaa	The US spend 600 billion a year on Medicare/Medicad.  Universal health care would be that much, plus some.  That's just one of the freebies he wants to create.  The answer in infinity and beyond!  |`|7DAIw6XTaa	Most people cite 'Obamas crazy social programs' as evidence he will increase spending. Few can correctly identify these programs though. The reality is... he isn't proposing any new social programs other than health care. Which many have misrepresented as being 'free' or a 'hand-out'. That couldn't be farther from the truth... in fact, Obama's health care plan is less of a 'hand-out' than John McCain's. Obama Offers you government health care if you want to BUY it from the government. It is not mandated that you purchase the government plan.   McCain takes tax money divides it up and REDISTRIBUTES it to the health insurance companies. I wonder how McCain plans to keep the Iraq war going, open wars on new fronts, increase the size of the military, give everyone a $2,500 tax credit for health care ($5,000 for families). Republicans on this board are fond of pointing out that 40% of Americans don't pay income tax. Well... if they are getting this health care credit McCain has proposed.. then guess what... that is a perfect example of 'redistribution of wealth'.

Sick of Republican 8 year of Bush  2. more poor people like his tax cut, tax for rich  3. More people don't want war anymore  4. He will appoint more liberal people to court system  5. First black to summon all 99% of black votes.    Obanana - Loses    1. Black - It could be race issue  2. Inexperience - not sure if he knows anything at all but talk  3. Wright and Ayers  4. Bad economy may affect his tax cut from fifthy rich people  5. Election of Biden    McSame - Wins    1. Experience,   2. Americans need more protection, don't want another 9/11  3. Fair on tax cut  4. Palin may attract women voters  5. War Hero    McSame - loses    1. Age  2. Palin - many people don't trust her  3. Bush as Republican (would it better if he runs as Independent?_  4. More black people coming out to vote  |`|T2Yz0kLTaa	mrbean|`|g6ZNzLm3aa	I think Obama. He stands for what America needs. He is going to lower taxes for the people that need a break instead of the wealthy people who have so much money to spend. The war in Iraq needs to end. We are spending billions of dollars a month over there and none of it here. John McCain is just like George Bush. Do we really need a repeat of the last 8 year? Seriously 100% of John McCain's advertisements are negative and attacks at Obama, but all John McCain can talk about is his energy plan. Also John McCain is in his late 70's and hs had cancer 4 times. It is most likely that he will die soon, and then Palin will be our new president. HOW SCARY IS THAT!!!!! if that is not a clear message of why not to vote fr McCain, I don't know what is! Obama will change America in the way we all need it! Obama is going to make a wonderful President!  |`|AEuqzxcLaa	I'm praying and campaigning for Obama to win.  This country needs change and the only one that is offering change is Obama.  McCain is just 4 more years of Bush that is why he's attacking Obama and not discussing issues. |`|R0LM9Hy8aa	I think it will come down to either the Bradley effect or voter fraud.     If all the fraudulent voters end up being counted, Hussein will win by a nose, if all those redneck Democrats in the flyover states stay home because they just can't pull the lever for a black man then it will be McCain by a nose.|`|bzJJswIwaa	neither can win because what one candidate doesn't have the other one does.

Many folks in my state are Independent.  But you have to pick one of the major two big parties to be able to register.  I was always registered republican because everyone else I know is republican.  I always vote Democrat.  I would be called all kinds of names if my friends found out.  They can't watch me vote.    Last Tuesday I voted for Obama.    Look in my front yard.  There is a McCain sign out there.  If I put an Obama sign in my yard they would paint swastikas on my house TP my trees.  Bust my mailbox.  The groups of old ladies would never stop ringing my doorbell to try and make me repent.    Just vote how you feel.  Don't worry about anyone else.  They won't know how you voted.  Unless you tell them.    I do get about seven Robocalls a day from the "Old Lump Jaw" crowd making sure I am going to support the republicans this election because Obama is a this or that.  I just hang up and go back to typing to you guys.|`|db48dc23f23b23691bf920ff83b525d4aa	It is legal and the democrats have been doing this since Richard Nixon.    Secondly, it is a very well know fact that since Jimmy Carter, democrats have been less and less motivated to go vote. So your claim that the republican party is attempting to deflate the motivation of the democrat voter is faulty at best and more than likely an untruth.    Third, if you don't have enough courage to stand up for your values and beliefs, then you should not be voting to begin with. I guess that when the NAZI party finds as eloquent and charismatic celebrity as Hussein Obama, you will vote for that individual as well. Lack of conviction and courage are not the values that real American possess.   |`|YqaKgYQ9aa	I am republican and registered that way and never was asked this.|`|6QOKsVaPaa	That's why we vote in private.

Yes, it is legal and damn funny how easily your side is manipulated. You think you are so far ahead but just like they did in Ohio, Barry will be defeated easily.    The Republicans are the only thing that kept Hilary in so long. We kept voting for her because we knew she would dig up all the dirt for us.     We are using the liberal media against itself.    Too funny!    Edit: To those that claim it is illegal. What law is being broken? They are asking them to lie to the POLLSTERS. Pollsters are NOT the government and are private groups.

Maybe we need Obama in for at least a few months just to let this road get paved.|`|AA11214871	I hope you are right.|`|IcqKbHhEaa	I think you have your facts wrong.|`|GEGjoKtqaa	Except for the Rasmussen poll :)  They predicted Bush would win.  And look who's ahead in Rasmussen *cough*Obama*cough*  BTW, I'm not over-confident, I still think McLame can pull it off.  ~~~~~~~  LOL at the Bible Beaters that give my comment thumbs down.

I mean, seriously, have you seen what affect he's had on the country? Now southern states who haven't voted democrat in 40 years are leaning Obama (and yes, i'm referring to North Carolina).    Oh, P.S., not to mention most places have him winning the election WITHOUT swing states. That's pretty damn impressive!    Oh, P.S.S. Remember how high gas was under Bush about a month ago?    Obama '08|`|wxXjMGqaaa	Randy, I totally agree!    When it really comes down to it, the American people will pick capitalism over socialism, because if anyone was to learn from it's mistakes from the past, it's the United states of America!      Our founding fathers did not want a country run by the government, but "for the people, of the people, by the people"      It'll never change, nor should it.  It can adapt over time, but change the core values of our constitution, our founding fathers, our democracy? NEVER!            |`|7f350f830ee31ebce51cf080a09328bdaa	Your right McCain will win because Barry supporters are forgetting one thing, the majority of Americans do not want socialism.|`|ZTJMLDFraa	VOTE 4 OBAMA!

They always favor the democrats. But when election day comes, that's when the Libs whine.
wVik8Fo7aa	Bush has lived in a protective bubble for almost 8 years, surrounded by people who give him news tidbits they think he wants to hear.  He openly admits to not reading newspapers, and it's quite obvious that he is as incurious as he is incompetent.  Bush repeatedly comments that he doesn't dwell on how history will remember him, because he'll be dead.  So, no, he will never recognize nor accept the damage he has wrought to his own country and the world.  |`|AA11746917	He didn't make the mess by himself. Congress can share the blame. The notion that the President single handedly runs this country is ignorant.|`|i0LUuhyLaa	I don't know if he is sad but I don't care if he is. Good riddance to a liar. He needs to ask for forgiveness with his illegal war.|`|2Hlctljgaa	And that mess would be???  
COecrPrMaa	Well if you donated to his campaign or voted for him, he should let you in for free... since he is all about 'charity' right?|`|aGNjZmyJaa	I doubt he will. Its mostly for supporters, so they won't be charged.|`|85jy4Mt0aa	There will be many parties.  Most are free.  Some will be by invitation.  The press access for both the McCain and Obama victory parties (though only one will turn out to be a victory party) will require payment of a few hundred dollars per press organization.|`|AA12358300	Don't worry, he will get it for you from the rich, so you can party all night long.|`|5kJDDgDcaa	No, don't be ridiculous.|`|oRrwl7Zcaa	Hell yea i wanna party with obama supporters like myself!|`|EFwElvRhaa	Don't buy your ticket yet.  Find something constructive to do instead.

1366101cff13febe85b60d1af98ab6e3aa	I saw the footage that you mention.It was actually Iraqi police doing the beating however it was being filmed by American (observer) troops who were joking at the time.|`|ITa7GOPGaa	I think the coalition forces have been very guilty of many wrong doings in Iraq, although there are so many out there who have the utmost respect for completely innocent civilians.  I think many soldiers have been lead to believe all Iraqis are terrorists, or they have experienced an incident maybe when one of their colleagues' has died.  It's very hard to justify soldiers committing awful acts in Iraq, as there is no justification.  I can only give factors as to why they carry such hatred for other human beings. What a mess it is out there!|`|d5a8b147a3638af9591053b6e3732502aa	Ash i haven't seen this footage,  however - who recorded it? was it an American reporter - was it some Iraqi recording it? - did you see the events that led to this "beating" i doubt it, how do u know this person wasn't an insurgent? or Iranian agent? were weapons in his house/car?    any of the above - and they are quite feasible i promise you, would qualify the "victim" for several rounds in the head - maybe he got off light with just a kicking?    Try and bear in mind that the press are actually very poor in what they report - censoring certain parts to get the most sensational images - and if the source of footage was a local? well then it was even more likely staged/ taken out of context.    maybe they were laughing because they just caught the bloke who initiated a IED that they barely survived - and they are obviously happy they have caught the man who tried to kill them?    or maybe they were beating up a innocent civilian? were is the video - on what site?|`|AA11033772	Hum. You watched a video. How do you know they are American soldiers? How do you know they are innocent? How do you know they are civilians (I assume that's what you meant by 'suvillians')? How do you know it wasn't staged?
mrbEZLaEaa	They attack Joe because he has caused quite a stir, which is good.  He actually busted Obama for telling the truth about taxes. Obama's experience is very limited...mainly associating with thugs. He only wants power and money and doesn't give a Rat's *** about Americans!|`|55fe149f91ab8a2b921fb7e1965a61baaa	Because the Messiah doesn't make gaffes. And the Messiah doesn't lie. So it has to be a Republican smear. they planted Joe. Only possible answer.|`|90b77bbefba2eb318173c23604ffe4d2aa	Because they can not allow free speech. When the reporter on that TV station questioned Biden a little to hard, they pulled everything from that station. Refused to allow them any access to Obama or Biden.  HELLO!!!!    There goes your first amendment.    Your second will be next.     This should make people very, very afraid. No candidate has ever felt the need to attack an ordinary citizen the way that Obama people have.     read more here:  http://united4mccain.com  and see links to more information that they don't want you to see... since some *** pulled one of my answers for posting this site. There is no free speech here either!!|`|OgTkxG7Vaa	Joe the Plumber is a distraction. What intelligent person could vote Republican after the last eight years of Republican "leadership"?|`|xP49Lhfwaa	Obama has not attacked Joe. The media investigated him and found out he cheated on taxes and is unlicensed.     Obama handled it well. He told the truth I don't see a problem. Joe had his 15 minutes now it's time to move on to more important things.|`|VZSYTp6Saa	Joe the Plumber represents many one of us who would like the opportunity to make "the big bucks" without being taxed to death.    That is why Obama's camp doesn't like Joe. They're afraid we'll start to see Joe's point and turn our backs on the O-man.|`|ps8eqCSLaa	When you read about the "spread the wealth" claims in context, when Senator's Obama talks about redistribution, he's not talking about taxing the rich to give handouts. Senator Obama said "It's not that I want to punish your success. I just want to make sure that everybody who is behind you, that they've got a chance for success too," Obama responded. "My attitude is that if the economy's good for folks from the bottom up, it's gonna be good for everybody ... I think when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody." When there's a flourishing middle class, they are able to use their discretionary (extra) income to buy, not just based on credit, but with real cash, they're able to improve output, raise the Gross Domestic Product, and create profit to the producers. Those would be who're making over $250,000.    Right out of Economics 101. Free market.     Joe the plumber didn't ask for media attention. However when John McCain brought him up, the news field was curious about Joe the Plumber, and since Joe seems happy to have attention (as he's now campaigning for John McCain) Joe the Plumber has been supporting ridiculous notions and people attack that. Why are they ridiculous? Because he has no facts/evidence/or arguments to back up his statement.    Joe the Plumber, as well as BOTH Senator McCain & Senator Obama have these die hard followers. Many people vote knowing one or two regurgitated facts, if even that.    So, to answer your question, depends who're your asking.|`|AA11282128	I'm not attacking JOE but I did do my research to check on him    1. He is not a plumber  2. He only makes 40,000 a year as a contractor  3. He has a lien against him because $1,183 in personal property taxes had not been paid.  4. He call spreading an hand out but took money from a radio show to pay for is lien ( can we call that welfare repub.) Since i have not been on it just asking.   5. He boss is not trying to sale him his business.   6. Under Obama tax plan he would be more able to benefit the tax cuts.   7.He is still not register to vote.  8. He is to sign a record deal, so no more joe the plumber    McCain can use Joe as an example but to hit home let me hear about the mother who works two jobs to pay the bills, the college student that has one full time job and one part-time one to stay in school or how about the family that has both mother and father that lost their jobs at the factory because the business lost money on stock but paid the CEO 10 billion as retirement. That the stories that I HEAR on yahoo message or on face-book . They are the Joe's and Jane's too. They need tax cut not just business that made 15.4 billion dollars in profits the last quarter. |`|fh12fkNWaa	Because we see the bigger gaffe of McCain holding a tax evader up as an average American without having vetted him before putting the guy in his debate speech and taking him on the rally tour. Either he didn't vette him as all presidents do before mentioning someone in a speech or he knew the guy was going to get thrown under the media bus for his less that legal life. Either way, McCain doesn't look good.|`|k6hicodfaa	Well Joe the Plumber's premise was flawerd.  He's also not named Joe and not a plumber.  He also hasn't paid his taxes.      The McCain camp would have had to get his permission to use his name like they did in debates, legally, and thus he was opened up to the media due to that discourse.    |`|fUh7LHzvaa	I think you are wrong on this. Joe the unlicensed plumber has brought this attention on himself...if he can't take the heat, then he shouldn't try to make it worse by becoming a McCain campaign surrogate.    The reality is that Joe the plumber will get a bigger tax break under Obama so that he can save money for that business he wants to buy. Thats the fact.  |`|5bzJUmh4aa	I attack him for his stupidity.  He was complaining about taxes.  He will pay LESS in taxes under Obama than he would under McCain.  Yet he supports McCain becuase of the tax issue!?!  He absolutely should be attacked.      What, are you Republicans worried about his self esteem?  Freedom of speech works both ways.  Time to toughen up or shut up.  |`|AA11993638	Lie or truth on the part of Joe the comment made by Obama did give a wake up call to some, enough for them to realize what he states in front of the crowds just might not be reality. They will not admit this as they worship the ground he walks on. I am guessing it is like the every shrinking wage of those who would be affected least by his tax plan, $300,000, $250,000, $200,000, and most recently $150,000. |`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	Considering that "Joe the Plumber" is the first man Obama has put OUT of business.  A common man of fair means asking a simple question.  Now the business that he wanted to buy, he can no longer work for because of the Media attention.  Do you want a Plumber coming to your house followed by 100 radio and TV people asking Why did you hire him and so on.  Obama has cheered on the media and mocked the fact that a plumber can not make $250,000. a year.  People who go into business usually have a high profit margin with a lot of money riding and a lot of long hours. Obviously because Obama has only been a  community organizer who doesn't't get paid they get rewarded by accomplishing feats for other people who want something done.  He has no clue about having a real job,plumber, mechanic or a builder.|`|68149b1f13e1ba3a68e7e708172ff96baa	Listen.. Joe has been holding press conferences and campaigning. I hardly think that he is a private Citizen anymore.      That said, it probably was the wrong choice of words to use.    Why doesn't anyone care that Joe totally lied about his plans??|`|AA11746917	O-bots are just following their leader. It's a crying shame in this country when an average American can't question a presidential candidate without enduring abuse. It is a testament to how crazy the people in this country have gotten.|`|e52Wy71Laa	Can you explain the gaffe?  I wasn't aware there was one.  I also hadn't been aware that Obama supporters were attacking him.    EDIT: Props to Ed A for making me go find the actual transcript.  It's a little different than what Ed describes.|`|NYsk0T0caa	Because joe the plumber is so obnoxious. He is not a licensed plumber, he isn't about to buy a business, he owes back taxes...etc.etc. Then he turns around and says Obama does not support Israel. who does this man think he is. He is a puppet for the GOP. He does not represent the true middle class. If he can't even pay his taxes why should I care what his opinion is?|`|5XYa4p1Iaa	Joe brought up a very good question to which the Obamanator could only answer that he wanted whatever he considered 'excess earnings' to buy votes elsewhere.    We have progressive tax already, evil as it is, but the founder of the Obamanation put it simply - he thinks 250K is the limit before Uncle Sam can take more of your money just because he wants to.    the 'walking O-man' is a terrific speaker and puts on a good show, but like Rod Stewart (also good at both), song and dance only last so long.   After that, you want something of substance and Obama is demonstrably short on track record, respectable performance and vision.  He's FDR   3 where Carter was FDR  2.

That's about it though.|`|AA11746917	What she means, fool, is that if the First Ammendment gives us the freedom of speech, then why is the media attacking her for saying negative things about Obama? Aren't we supposed to be allowed to say what's on our mind? Unfortunately that hasn't been the case this election year. The mainstream media is so pro-Obama, that they attack anyone who criticizes him.  It's ridiculous, and most of all it's frightening.|`|5DBVCyA9aa	The huffingtonpost is just liberal propaganda. Yes I believe Sarah Palin.    Aproval ratings of the people:    Congress 8%  Bush 14%  Palin 92%|`|GmvOeTMnaa	okay, first off, what she meant by that is:    She cant say or do whatever she wants because every time she does the media, and the negative campaign run by obama will mock her every action/word.  In Essence she is saying that her first amendment right are being threatened  because soon she wont be able to say anything without the media putting their two cents in.      And another thing obama has done things that are much more idiotic that anything Palin has ever done....Here's a list.    !) obama said there are 57 states, and has two more to visit  2) he said that the people in the crowd were being honored on memorial day, when memorial day honors those who lost there lives in the war.  3) he said his uncle liberated the Auschwitz Nazi camp, when he served in the US Army, when it was in fact The Red Army.  
uTHZKnHHaa	No once again it is talk radio not paying attention the first time and then making it sound like "Socialism."  People who make between $150,000-$200,000 will have little or no increase in taxes and people who make more than $250,000 will pay more.    Obama wants to return taxes to about what they were under Reagan.  Much of this will be automatic by letting the tax breaks given the rich by Bush expire.|`|plRxG9sPaa	Yes,He vote 94 times to raise taxes on the people that over $42,000 in years past, He is a fraud, If he gets in your taxes will be raised,|`|AA11269647	When he is elected you will find the real level. The problem with raising taxes on only the rich is you don't raise very much money. If you want to get a lot of money you need to get it from the 20,000 to 100,000 income level. That is where everybody is.|`|gIEWfDj3aa	No - Income is taxable way before an individual reaches that level.    The number refers to the level of taxable income where Obama is proposing a change in the current tax rate.  And no, Obama has not changed his proposal.  He is proposing a slight increase in the rate for income OVER $250K per couple or 200K per individual.|`|cRDbeUDvaa	No.  Obama has always proposed the set the highest income tax bracket at $250,000 for joint filers, and $200,000 for single filers.  I heard McCain on Meet the Press lie about Obama changing the number to suit polling data.  Imagine that.  McCain lying about Obama's tax plan.|`|7Wi32KRgaa	now it is down to 150,000|`|AA12358300	maybe, he will change it back after he is elected ..    "Change we Need" that is what he said|`|cVEHvqxEaa	Nope.
OHn91mP1aa	And don't forget McCain's association with Bush.    But wait...he's not really been associating with Bush during the campaign.  Hmmmm.  I wonder why?|`|sF99nJFsaa	Because Associations shows beliefs! ...associations shows what kind of people you have chosen to be part of! ...Association shows what your principles are and what you want to be next to!    ALL that crap that "guilty by association" is not right is baloney...it IS correct! As social creatures, we ARE what we chose to associate ourselves with, been that part of Democracy, Freedom or hate and/or bigotry from the "right" or the "left"! ...and yes, there is big time bigotry on the "left" too! They can be as inflexible, and set in their ways and views as the extreme right wing can be too!    When I talk about association, I talk about NOT race, NOT country of origin, but association!... which is a free choice to be part of something or some group. And for someone to be for 20 years!!!....not 1 or 5 or even 10, but 20 years associated with an extremist like the so called reverend is a CLEAR indication, as clear as it can be, that Obama thinks like that too.     Listen, if I went to a church where a preacher was spewing crap and hate like that from the pulpit on a regular basis (and I do not attend church often), I would not be there for a minute longer than it would take me to walk out of there. I would not give a minute of support with my presence and my ears not one minute!    And Obama has been pals and a religious and/or philosophical disciple of this guy for 20 years............? ...yes, also philosophical leader too! ...Because THAT is what Obama has technically done by relying on that preacher for religious guidence, not just to be his religious teacher, but also to be his philosophical guide, a result of letting that preacher "guide" him for all those 20 years.     So it is logical to think that a lot of the so called preachers' logic must be also in Obamas' head, a lot of the same views and teachings of how things are here in our country, of what we are about, of what America is all about...!    |`|tDHTtLtLaa	Hey just look at who's campaigning for the Republicans..

Having life-long associations is another.    Guess the Left doesn't know the difference, like they don't know the difference between a tax cut to people who actually pay taxes and welfare to people who don't.|`|VbfhlTN9aa	BEING ASSOCIATED WITH SOME IS ONE THING BUT HAVING PEOPLE LIKE THAT AS MENTORS IS ONE DIFFERENT. |`|AA11746917	If it happens once, it's understandable, but when someone continues to associate with unsavory characters time after time, it becomes suspect. To know a sleazy person is one thing, but to do business with them,  and to associate with them is quite another.|`|v28dukr7aa	Democrats use it too.   |`|z6OePRCMaa	Kind of like Bush=McCain, ya mean?|`|pOjL5dWeaa	It's called Chicago thug politics! |`|DtnGtStKaa	The one that concerns me most is Rev. Wright, because one assumes you select a pastor based on him being someone whose advice you value.  The fact that Obama values the advice of a racist concerns me.|`|AA11561314	This coming from a person who sides with the party trying to associate McCain with Bush.  Libs have always been double standard hypocrites.|`|rHwE5Rkbaa	We tend to take on the tendencies of our associates - for better or for worse.    When McCain realized that he knew bad folks, he both distanced himself from them by both refusing to meet with them further, or to denounce their activities or both... and by apologizing for associating with bad people.    Obama has done neither.  Even after allegedly "finding out" about their activities or histories, he continues to defend them, saying that he "didn't know."    Yes, it's the oldest trick in the book... and if a person doesn't have the political savvy to understand that associating with unrepentant terrorists (Ayers), racist religious figures (Wright), and genocidal political advisers (the Hamas negotiator/adviser to the Palestinians, Syria and Iran), perhaps he should consider a different line of work.  To then "defend" himself by saying that he never knew or the people had "changed" is on the other side of ridiculous - in that the people in question have very recently said that they agree with what they did/said and that they wished they could continue or go farther with their ideologies.    He's deluded and/or such a horrid judge of character that he frightens me.|`|tmer08ZQaa	Yes, however with Obama, it's like ALL of his associates are shady. I can understand a few... but damn!|`|5kJDDgDcaa	True. If that's the case, perhaps we should bring up Larry Craig??  |`|9AY68T6Eaa	Because it has won them the white house in 5 elections since 1980.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	Obama does nothing but apologize for his friends actions. he has not truly denounced the way they act and think. When has he said he was wrong for listening to Black Liberation Theologist Rev Wright for 20 years?

2FeDnO0Saa	Good question. Because they are misinformed? People have been indoctrinated with the idea of Socialism = dictatorship, freedom = democracy. Do you live in a democracy at the moment? Can you vote for what you believe in, when the main parties are all the same?    It is also because of Stalin himself. Remember that he airbrushed Trotsky out of history - the one Communist (as well as Lenin) who stood for true socialism, internationally.    Socialism to me means that we are in control of our lives and have a say over how we spend our time. It is not about profits for a few while the vast majority of the population live in poverty (capitalism), or about a few bureaucrats living a luxurious life and putting themselves first, not caring about and even helping put own revolutions in other countries (Stalinism).    At the beginning of the Russian revolution, things were done differently. Different nations had the right of self-determination. People formed soviets (the word simply means "council") to run their workplaces without bosses. For the first time ordinary people were in charge. But this was tragically short-lived. Stalin took over the country with an iron grip - liquidating his opponents.    True socialism is about democracy - about winning over people with fair argument, not by force. By having a free press and a society where people are informed truthfully about events, rather than the lies peddled by the mass media. An equal society where everyone does a fair share of the work, and is rewarded equally, without the inefficiency, profiteering or bureacracy of capitalism. Where public services are PUBLIC, free to everybody and not private, to make a profit out of others' misfortune.    Join the socialists - we believe that, through revolution internationally, such an equal, fair world is a possibility. Socialism would herald the end of prejudice, division and war over commodities.|`|OPzH4ih0aa	Because they are ignorant and they've been conditioned to think that any kind of socialism is bad because they grew up during the Cold War. Plus, they don't realize that Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin had a different approach to socialism from what Karl Marx intended. I imagine it's for the same reason they think The Bible says homosexuality is a sin or why The Qu'ran preaches terrorism. All they know is what the media tells them because they're too lazy to read. Reading something like The Communist Manifesto requires too many brain cells and abstract thinking.|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	Americans  will never  understand socialism because it goes  against everything they  have ever  known. Its not part of  their  political system to look after  each other  in a social way,.     Most Americans confuse socialism with communism, mostly due to  the  Stalinist communism  of  the  pre /post war  cold war  situation of  eastern Europe .     The American way is  that a MAN should look after himself and family  and not re lie on  the government to mollycoddle him with generous  handouts  and dictate  how  he should live his  life or how he should  spend  his money. (Each man for  himself) and (Not one for  all -  All  for one) which is  really what  proper  socialism is all about.    In a true a socialist state  the  entire  wealth of  the  state would  be used  for the  welfare of  the  entire population where  each man  woman and  child  would be  treated  equally and fairly with no one person   getting rich at the  expense of  the  others .|`|AA12121752	It is because socialists have a tendency to act like stalin - or any other incompetent control freaks.  |`|QqxrVVnlaa	T-Bone doesn't understand socialism at all. It just sounds like he's regurgitating the anti-socialist propaganda that's been shoved down people's throats for years.    The Russian revolution was defeated from outside, not because inherent flaw in socialism. Lenin always said that no single communist country could survive, it needed a world revolution, or at least a revolution in some of the more advanced capitalist nations. Don't forget that Germany went into revolution between 1918-1923.    Immediately after the Russian Revolution massive social progress was made. Abortion became legal and available on demand, divorce was made immediate on demand, people, for the first time in their lives, and for the first time since the Paris commune, actually had a say in the way their society was run.    Unfortunately, in a situation where Russia was alone and in need of support from outside, Stalin was able to seize power. When Lenin died and Trotsky was 'airbrushed out of history', this marked the end of socialism in Russia and led to state capitalism.    There are some excellent books out there for people to read that will enable you to understand what happened. 'The History of the Russian Revolution' by Leon Trotsky is superb, and 'Revolution Besieged' by Tony Cliff. |`|33xCiAlcaa	Presumably because their understanding of socialism is poor.|`|YqcU7O0Faa	To answer your question;    The biggest fallacy about socialism is that it will work if the right people are in charge.

"Communism" used to be the bogeyman, as is "terrorism" today.  US gouvernments need to keep their population in fear and ignorance, if the people had a look over the fence without prejudice they might find that "old" "socialist" Europeans are doing better than them, and wonder why.    I could tell them it is exactly because their gouvernments were into spreading the wealth from the rich to the poor through taxes. In the last decade many were tempted to follow the American model, but most of these gouvernments have been told by the voters that that would not be acceptable to them.

Everyone expects Obama to win traditionally democratic strongholds like New York and California.  But Obama is also leading in many states that were once Republican states like Virginia, Florida and Ohio.    Current projections show an electoral vote of roughly 350 for Obama and around 170 for McCain, mind you, you need 270 to win.  Somehow McCain will have to turn the tide and snatch back at least 100 electoral votes.  That means he has to win in Florida, Virginia and Ohio.  That means he has to get them all, not just one or the other, but all of them.    It's possible, but it will be difficult for McCain.

He has to do this...either break his promises (just like bill clinton did and raised taxes), or he has to let the national debt get even bigger.    I think either way he wins, because he'll just blame that on George Bush. I mean just the other day, I was in an argument with my girlfriend...I had not out, didn't know what to say. Then it dawned on me...George Bush...yeah! Glad to say that is all behind me now and I am no longer in trouble with my girlfriend.

Could end up signing a bunch of silly liberal legislation fed him by Pelosi and Reid.  Likely to raise taxes.    McCain Pros:  loves his nation.  Veteran.  Tough enough to stand up for his nation in international issues.  Less likely to raise taxes.    McCain Cons:  nothing new; may not be perceived as a true change from the past 8 years.  Might be too laizze faire with the economy.    This is a very tough choice for me, mostly because I'd like to say I voted for the first black president.

One day of vacation never hurt anyone, besides, there has been talk in both parties of making election day a federal holiday.|`|SbxNOrwfaa	we should stop hate each other and stick together to fight against  our government and take back our country    enough is enough!!!!|`|Hlr0rTzraa	I just love your questions, Yes will be glad when this is over and probably won't be back on yahoo either.|`|AA12358300	sure, and let the rich pay for it.. right!?|`|EcrCIqP7aa	Oh yes, after the token one is elected non of us will ever have to work again. OHHH Thank you token "N"      nobama wants everyone to take election day off. Can you imagine he is starting s*it already.|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	I think its funny you ask, since the majority of welfare recipients have decided that they will just take every day off and leach off the people Obama hates most. It makes you wonder if they will get off their LAZY buts and bother to vote. Without them Obama will not win.|`|k4Xg3pI3aa	I've taken the Wednesday off so I can watch Tuesday in America.  |`|yVwkHIXDaa	Sure. Go for it.|`|EaC4mUa6aa	Yes|`|fY0uG1o2aa	you go right ahead. I got bills to pay|`|EYaC215Uaa	why?|`|lklwmGh6aa	Cool gov. paid?  I could use a vacation from this crap.    |`|77JOaNBgaa	yes as a matter of fact i will invite as many democrats as would like to go to a deserted island somewhere on election day...and maybe never come back...that would be great! you could elect obama president of dem island,and life would be perfect. |`|6v4HPZZ3aa	That depends... will the Obama brownshirts come looking for me with sticks in hand and demanding that I get back to work to pay for the common good?|`|ae54718496dc216dbde0762324f5ee8caa	No. We should work, and take off the last 2 hours to have time to go and vote, since by law, as it has always been, an Employer is not allowed to keep you working so you cannot get to the voting booth. Everyone who wants to vote, is supposed to automatically be let out of work to have time to do so.    How lazy does Barack Obama think the Liberals are? Do they need a whole day (or week) to color in the little circle with his name next to it? How lazy does he want the American people to be? Enough to go on welfare, and get "free" second rate Health-Care?    It seems so. Luis Farrakhan asked black men to take the day off for the Million Black Man March to the White House, too, to protest. A Million men didn't show-up.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	The best idea is to have elections on Sunday. Many people have the day off.|`|285466a34d0961c1ac54895e036af8c7aa	I did... My birthday is right after election day... But I get paid for the days I'm taking off    Your name is scary!!!|`|2bead0318840910522a4607acde0bb73aa	No, some of us have to work.  Why worry, most Obamabots are college students who DON'T have a job!|`|AA11334116	Sure, if you've got vacation time go for it. Enjoy yourself!
GOq0naEZaa	non lo so ma questa storia della carfagna  subito entrata nel costume italiano. tutti giocano con battutine sulla carfagna non chiedermi perch. forse perch era una show girl e ha fatto foto nuda e allora l'associazione carfagna/baldracca  stata facilitata|`|fi59ygekaa	Beh quello che dici  vero,spesso molti si fidano del "si dice che".Nel caso della Carfagna per ci sono state delle fughe di notizie su un'intercettazione CHE C'ERA,che aveva quel porno contenuto.Bene,la notizia non  certa, di certo c' che 1)Queste fonti all'interno dei tribunali,per quanto ritengo vergognoso il fatto che ci siano,sono quasi sempre attendibili.Ad esempio perch parlavano di sesso orale e non di rapporto completo?Perch il premier secondo tali fonti elogiava le doti di bocca della Carfagna. 2)L'urgenza espressa pi volte da membri del Pdl di mandare al macero le intercettazioni come previsto per legge,ma con una certa "strana" fretta. 3)L'urgenza del decreto sulle intercettazioni appena uscite le "voci". 4)Una velina senza nessuna esperienza...ma soprattutto a mio avviso senza nessuna qualit politica  stata fatta ministro.Ti sei mai chiesto perch?E io non faccio l'associazione "belle allora baldracca messa la per quello",perche potrei farlo con altre parlamentari.Ma non lo faccio.  Queste insomma non sono prove,ma ci fanno costuire delle opinioni.E la mia opinione  che effettivamente la Carfagna queste doti di cui sopra le abbia eccome.E che Silvio le abbia potute apprezzare.|`|gqkUqmZsaa	Secondo me tutto deriva dall'aver nominato ministro una che era nota solamente per calendari e comparsate tv di basso livello: in tale situazione, e in altre,  inevitabile che ci si chieda per quali meriti sia successo e si finisca a parlare di attivit boccaccesche pi o meno reali ma comunque credibili.    La stessa cosa non pu accadere per personaggi come Fini o Bersani, la Buongiorno o la Finocchiaro: si tratta di personaggi seri e credibili e eventuali maldicenze andrebbero provate.|`|nnfibDJQaa	.....le dicerie sono devastanti............ma a volte un piccolo fondo di verit c'.............. chiaro che se fosse venuta fuori la storia che Berlusconi se la faceva con la Gelmini..........forse non tutti ci credevano!!!..........insomma conoscendo un p il passato dei due personaggi in questione.......i dubbi ti vengono!!!..........Ma il problema di fondo non  la diceria............ che st gente qu ci governa!!!!!|`|6UO02ih7aa	Dai la cosa circola perch ci sono le intercettazioni , quindi non sono dei .

Non  che su questo caso io non ci dorma la notte..    Mi interessa di pi il fatto che una ragazza con un curriculum pari a ZERO  (anche se lei non non  certamente l'unico caso.. sia chiaro.. ) faccia il ministro della repubblica Italiana..    PERO'..  Credo sia vero.. e non perch "si dice".. ma perch ho fatto 2+2..    Quando scoppi il caso, e sembrava che le intercettazioni sulla Carfagna  stessero per saltare fuori da un momento all'altro, dato che erano terminate le indagini preliminari (era un gioved se non ricordo male..), Berlusconi fece preparare in fretta e furia un decreto per bloccare le intercettazioni stesse.. Quello stesso gioved Berlusconi annunci che sarebbe andato in prima serata in una puntata "speciale" di Matrix, da Mentana..    Poche ore dopo, quello stesso pomeriggio, il procuratore di Napoli fece sapere che tutte le intercettazioni sul caso, non inerenti a reati sarebbero state distrutte..    Mezz'ora dopo, la trasmissione di Matrix con Berlusconi venne cancellata e salt..  E la proposta del decreto sulle intercettazioni venne immediatamente lasciato decadere..    In quei giorni, il ministro Rotondi (come al solito fuori tempo e fuori luogo..)commentava le intercettazioni che stavano per uscire..    Rotondi, assicura che ?lItalia parla al telefono come Berlusconi e non come Eugenio Scalfari: gli italiani scherzano, alludono, dicono pure una porcheria ogni tanto, e gli piace cos?. Ora credono di illuminare con le intercettazioni le miserie di Berlusconi e, invece, per la gente saranno grandezze      A ME TUTTO QUESTO FA PENSARE MALE..  --------------------  AI SIGNORI SOTTO DI ME..    Se bastasse una laurea per diventare ministri, ci potrebbero essere centinaia di migliaia di ministri l'anno..    Almeno in un ruolo del genere occorre esperienza..  Questo intendo come curriculum..  ----------  Luisbigar..Luxuria non  mai stato ministro..    TI RIBADISCO.. NON ERA MINISTRO!!   ECCO LA MIA ILLUMINANTE RISPOSTA..    Inoltre..

Torno giusto adesso a casa da una bella serata e mi tocca sorbirmi i tuoi deliri..    Da dove comincio???..    Se non riesci a capire la differenza tra un parlamentare ed un ministro (ti ricordo di fare meno il furbino.. tu hai scritto che Luxuria era un ministro del governo Prodi.. cosa falsa..)mi chiedo cosa tu ci faccia su politica e governo.. UN MINISTRO HA LA COMPLETA GESTIONE DI UN APPARATO DELLO STATO..  Se non capisci la differenza con un semplice parlamentare stai messo davvero maluccio..    Ah.. comunque, il semplice ex parlamentare Wladimir Luxuria (che tra le altre cose non fa parte del partito che voto..) si  laureato in Lingue e letterature straniere.. Con 110 e lode..

Ho scritto CHIARO E TONDO  che la Carfagna non  l'unico esempio di ministri incompetenti.. Anche se forse il pi grave..    Se vuoi rispondermi prenditi la briga di leggere quello che scrivo..    Io ho solo risposto alla tua BALLA delle ministre di centrosinistra senza laurea..    Io sono abituato a scrivere di cose che conosco..In genere cos si evita di dire potenziali vaccate..    Ovviamente tu non ti poni questo problema..      Andiamo ancora avanti..  Per rigirare la frittata tiri questa faccenda della Bindi.. A parte che non capisco che cavolo c'entra..

Comunque hai perfettamente ragione.  Se si tratta di diffamare, denigrare berlusconi qui ce ne sono a decine sempre pronti a dileggiare e a calunniare, salvo poi chiedere link e prove nel caso contrario. Inoltre c' sempre una schiera di azzecca-garbugli a portarti prove e discussioni e testimonianze inconfutabili tratte da giornali di sinistra che della materia scrivono fiumi di parole |`|y2t0UMSwaa	Ma  semplice, mio caro amico.    Le donne impegnate in politica nel centrosinistra: Livia Turco, Rosy Bindi, Emma Bonino, la Finocchiaro.    Nel centrodestra: La Santanch, la Mussolini, la Carfagna, la Gelmini.    Comprendi da solo che le prime devono pur aggrapparsi a qualche cosa....    Ed i sinistr.onzi, che rosicano perch si devono accontentare di quelle bruttone che hanno, gli fanno subito da cassa di risonanza.    Ora, onestamente, una domanda. Prendiamo la finocchiaro che, tra le quattro del centrosinistra  la meno brutta: se te la dasse, tu ci andresti a letto?     @ duxus    se ci fossero le intercettazioni Manifesto Liberazione e Unit si sarebbero affrettati a renderle pubbliche. (Fermo restando che la sinistra non  nuova ad inventare le notizie: vedi il caso Travaglio su Previti...)    @  Johnni Latex     Innanzi tutto la Carfagna  laureata in giurisprudenza, mentre non mi sembra che le signore del centrosinistra vantino titoli accademici (a parte una lunga militanza nel partito, ovviamente).   Ma gi che parliamo di curriculum, Luxuria che curriculum aveva quando era ministro del governo prodi? Attendo fiducioso una tua illuminante risposta.    @ Diavolo    A me se mi pagano no. Per, se mi assicurano un posto al parlamento europeo (ah,se ci sono riusciti Agnoletto e Santoro, ce riesco pure io a fare il parlamentare europeo) o alla camera dei deputati (se c' stato caruso ce posso andare pure io) che poi me garantisce una pensione di tutto rispetto (tipo i 5.500 euro che percepisce da anni Veltroni, anche se lui di anni ne ha appena 50) io uno sforzo con la finocchiaro posso anche farlo (ma solo con lei, per eh!).    @ tutti    chiss quante persone, nel mondo, hanno fatto fatto la misera fine della lewinsky: tanta dedizione per nulla... forse  questo che vi rode...    @ Johnny latex     ripeto la domanda. Luxuria che curri culum aveva?    @ Jhonny Latex    Che vuol dire che non era ministro? Un parlamentare, votando, decide se una legge passa o meno. Un voto pu fare la differenza. Ripeto la domanda: Che curriculum aveva?     Sono contento che le donne sinistr.onze hanno la laurea. La sanno usare? La Bindi si. Lo so. Infatti si premur di far caccare Frizzi dalla rai quando era ministro della salute, perch Funari, ospite di Frizzi, parl male della sanit italiana.    Quanto alla Carfagna ha una laurea anche lei. Perci non credo che quelle della turco e company valgano di pi. Perci al massimo hanno la stessa qualifica. Oppure la militanza nei partiti di sinistra da una qualifica maggiore?     Sono contento che sei un fan di agnoletto. Quanto al mio curriculum sempre pronto a confrontarlo con chiunque, specialmente col tuo.    A proposito: bella la mossa di espellere Villari dal PD. Alto esempio di democrazia. All'anima!!!    @ compagno chacom    Stai dicendo che, parallelamente, quando nel 1997 il governo prodi neg l'autorizzazione a procedere l'inchiesta di mani pulite contro i parlamentari della sinistra, vuol dire che questi avevano la coda di paglia? Che pu esserci, la coda di paglia, come non pu esserci la coda di paglia. Per anche in questo caso, magari, c'era. Vero?|`|Pke7dcyDaa	Semplice: perch ci sono delle intercettazioni che non possono essere rese pubbliche e che in giudizio non valgono niente per la legge blocca-processi che non fa usare le intercettazioni per i reati minori a 10 anni.  C' la coda di paglia, non  detto che ci sia la colpa, ma c' la coda di paglia, magari sopra una coda vera, ma c' la coda di paglia.  Scusa se sono ripetitivo, ma credo che logicamente questo non faccia una piega!  Ciao.|`|o9TKvM1Qaa	devo dire che sul caso carfagna c'ho inzuppato il biscotto pure io (non nel senso che me la sono fatta, non sono abbastanza ricco, ma che ci ho scherzato su).  tu hai ragione che il "si dice" non  una prova, ma non mi piace il fatto che ci siano delle intercettazioni distrutte; perch non rilevanti penalmente..ok, ma comunque se mi dicono che mi faccio le pere io voglio in tutti i modi dimostrare che non  vero e quindi ben vengano le intercettazioni, i test sulla droga e cos via.  un uomo pubblico ha una vita pubblica e non pu nascondere qualcosa su cui ci sia un dubbio, difendendosi con la privacy.  c' addirittura il dubbio che un ministro sia stato scelto per motivi sessuali...non puoi difenderti con la privacy, devi dimostrare che  falso.  clinton ha passato dei guai per un taglio di capelli ed un portavoce del pdl di nome italo...ed  giusto cos...che poi se se ne fosse fatto fare un po' di portavoce del pdl anche bush ci saremmo risparmiati una guerra....  un uomo politico deve dimostrare che nella vita privata segue quelle regole che vanta nella vita politica...la difesa della famiglia, ecc ecc.  non ho trovato scandalose le foto di sircana col trans...se vuoi fare politica ti devi sottomettere al giudizio pubblico, se no vai a fare l'operaio..  prodi non ha creato alcun problema per le intercettazioni di panorama e qualcuno di destra ha anche detto "bella forza! non c'era niente di scottante" come se fosse colpa di prodi non avere nulla da nascondere.  vedi...anche la destra usa determinati comportamenti degli uomini di sinistra per criticare la loro coerenza: le scarpe e la barchetta di d'alema, il cachemire e le festicciole di bertinotti, la casa a new york di veltroni, la scuola privata della figlia di santoro, addirittura la moglie di prodi che fu accusata di evasione in quanto socia di una srl,perch non dichiarava nella sua dichiarazione dei redditi i guadagni della srl (anche se pure le pietre sanno che le srl fanno dichiarazioni dei redditi e sono tassate a parte).....tutto giusto....un politico deve essere coerente coi suoi valori!!  berlusconi avrebbe dovuto far pubblicare le sue intercettazioni se non aveva niente da nascondere...se non le fa pubblicare un motivo ci sar.  quanto al problema carfagna, ti sei mai chiesto perch le stesse accuse non siano rivolte a belle donne come la gelmini o la prestigiacomo, a donne passabili come la meloni e neanche ad una ex playmate come la mussolini? perch hanno una storia politica o familiare che giustifica il loro ruolo...o perch figlie di imprenditori o di politici o perch fanno politica fin da giovani, nessuno ha da ridire su di loro...addirittura la brambilla non  stata attaccata come la carfagna, forse perch un certo spirito, una certa capacit l'ha dimostrata...  la carfagna no! ha detto che voleva fare il governatore della campania e l'hanno fatta ministro ma la sua carriera politica durava da 2-3 mesi...non di pi.  ma se ora silvio facesse ministre le due gemelle dell'isola dei famosi, sono autorizzato a pensar male o no? |`|GFkZqX1xaa	come hai detto tu, fanno comodo!  per me  un motivo in pi per non votare mai sinistra|`|PKFSc7ARaa	Guarda io non sono di destra, per ho visto in alcuni dibattiti la Carfagna e devo dire che l'ho trovata molto in gamba e battagliera.

Secondo me  tutta una montatura per far parlare, come al solito, di cose frivole gli italiani, e cos facendo, abbuiando i problemi seri.  Comunque hai ragione, non solo in politica, spesso le persone parlano di cose che non conoscono come se fossero vere, perch quando sono passate di voce in voce per 10 volte lo diventano. Pensa che dei miei amici una volta avevano sentito dire  da delle persone al bar che io ero andata con uno, ma questo io nemmeno lo conoscevo: pensa la curiosit, non so nemmeno se era un tipo che meritava o no, non me l'hanno nemmeno presentato 'sti str..zi, magari mi poteva pure piacere, no!!!|`|zRqrPojraa	Non ci sono prove, e' vero.    Pero', anche odiando Berlusconi, se realmente se lo e' fatto succhiare dalla Carfagna ha fatto l'unica cosa intelligente della sua vita.

All of the people who cannot admit that he's a GOOD MAN, even not considering his run for the presidency are closed minded fools. And that's being nice. McCain can be a good man if he wants to be, however, I do not think he's fit for the presidency. He was tortured in Nam. Most vets don't consider him a war hero. That has to take some kind of psychological affect on him.     As I've stated before. He's showing early signs of dementia. Watch him when he talks. kthx.|`|xr0mtQDfaa	I've made my decision to go with McCain on solid beliefs in the policies which he is proposing.    John McCain has proposed a tax break for virtually every single American in his tax policy but he goes short of giving people who don't pay taxes refunds. The Obama campaign has villified his policy as "Letting the Rich Get Richer" but h is actually providing sound fiscal restraint and tax relief for an economy that desperately needs it.  Where as Obama wants to hammer businesses with a 50% tax rate which will kill absolutely kill the already hurting economy.    John McCain knows who our friends are in the world and knows who are enemies are. He is a strong man who won't bow down to the United Nations demands for cooperation when it is not in the United States best interest and he won't court the entreats of dictatorships that have us in their cross hairs. Where as Obama is too eager to negotiate with our enemies and they have already made comments about his weak accomodting personality. Obama has already made drastic mistakes both with the Iraq surge and the Georgian conflict. As President he doesn't have the luxury of another person being senior to him correcting Americas view. Obama could have made an enemy out of an important ally had not Bush made the call and Obama's comments been published internationally. He is said to be methodical but just like Bush didn't at the beginning he doesn't understand the world stage and is too eager to be friends. This could cause us to make concession that we never as America should. John McCain has been a forgeign policy heavyweight for 30 years and can be trustd on the International stage.    John McCain has integrity, he has served his country for 50 years. He has been a loyal American and I bet my bottom dollar that he will protect Americas interest. He should've beat Bush in 2000 and we could have possibly avoided cerain messes but the subprime lending crisis is sitting on Arny Frank, Acorn, Freddie Mac and Barack Obama's front door. It was thier fault in the beginning that loose lending practices were implemented, now we are going to bring in an arsonist to stop a fire?    Barack's character is questionable, his experience is non-existent, his views are radical, and he has left in the wake of his life a long list of business associates, mentors, and aquaintances who are anti-American, radical, and fundamentalist. One radical you get a pass, two radicals I'm doubting a little. three radicals and I know what you are.    Liberals are forced to slander John McCain about infidelity to keep a footing. Infidelity? It was the staple of the Democrats for a decade. 30% of American couples have engaged in extra-marital affairs. John stepped up and was honest. He didn't hold a news conference and lie to people in the face. He has honor, integrity, and valor and that is what I want in a President.|`|CNroVD24aa	Obama IS friends with an unrepentant ex-terrorist. I don't think Obama wants to destroy the United States. I think he wants to remake it into a socialist country, and he's simply not aware or doesn't want to acknowledge that it would destroy this country.    Obama and his ilk would say that they hate the United States as it is today.|`|0KFGVrYuaa	Judging from Obama's past I wouldn't want to hang out with him.|`|AA12358300	Oh yes I admit Obama is a good man comparing to Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Michael Jackson..    Among black people, he is a good, but as President, I am not sure since so many years fellowship with Wright.|`|AA10126668	Even John MCain has admitted that Obama is a good man and would make a good president. McCain's followers however don't deserve to lick his shoes.|`|AA12357940	I cannot even admit that Obama is a good man.|`|6dB5yZbsaa	I believe everyone has good and bad in them just as everyone has a free will to choose who they want to vote for.

I think I did a little just thinking about it.|`|77JOaNBgaa	ok, spreading the wealth!! McCain Palin 08|`|FXAoIqcfaa	I think they are both good people.     If Obama was a terrorist and a socialist then why didnt people point this out when he ran for the Senate?     Some people are labeling him a terrorist because they dont want him elected. I dont think they honestly believe he is one though. |`|4sjGd3lMaa	He may be a good guy.  It's just that I don't think he is of sound mind.|`|bwx4gIYAaa	As people both of these men are good people and have remarkably achieved. I've always liked John McCain and I feel he's a stand up guy. I think that he's just allowed some rogues in his campaign to no let him be himself. On the other hand Barack Obama has ran a superb campaign and he's genuinely have the best answers for repairing our economy, and is very passionate about uniting Americans and America. He's also the have the best answers on foreign policy.    I'm really glad you posted this simple question cause it shows just what kind of people that many McCain/Palin supporters are. They're hate mongers and are truly miserable excuses for human beings. Here's a good example of "The Republican" base.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Wroj0FLv...      Obama/Biden 2008!!!|`|vFGojyBHaa	You didn't stop short, you called him a complete evil corrupt oil baron...not sure where you get the oil baron part but OK...now that you've exposed your bias I will be honest about BHO.  He's an empty suit, speaks well, looks OK, but he is the most dangerous candidate to run for high office ever.  His policies and agenda coupled with a congress controlled by Pelosi and Reid will change this country for decades to come - and not for the better.  He's a closet socialist and more left wing than Ted Kennedy (and that's going some!).   We do not need tax increases in times of economic stress, especially in the investor class - which is precisely the population targeted by BHO's tax plan.    NObama for me.  I'm voting for McCain/Palin all the way.

It's YOUR vote. Vote for who you want.    I don't believe it's right to vote for Obama simply because he's black. Sure, it would be GREAT to have a black president, and one day it will happen, but I think most people realize that Obama would not be a good president and it would be a shame to have the first black president remembered as a failure, in much the same way as Jimmy Carter.|`|cFqEp5x8aa	Although I agree with your parents that Obama is the best choice for President, I think you should vote based on your views.|`|pMCspswHaa	You should vote for whoever you want.

You shouldnt be voting to make history or because your family tells you to. It should be based on your views and which candidate fits under your views. I am voting for Obama. Even my dad told me I MUST vote for Obama and I told him, whoever I am voting is totally up to me and not him, because I am the one going to the poll booth and casting the vote. I am voting for Obama because my views goes will with his, not because my family supports Democrats. Anyways Good Luck!!! Try to convince your parents.|`|rgiwAOIjaa	Good for you..    Listen.. this is your constitutional right and your civic duty!! No ONE is allowed to persuade you to vote one way or the other.. and remember.. no one goes into that booth with you and pulls the lever.. So I would suggest you refrain from talking about politics until the election is over (at least with obama possessed family)...    Congrats on becoming a free thinking, independent, participating individual!  |`|AA10465540	You may vote for whomever you choose.  Your parents do not go into the voting booth with you and you do not have to be a registered democrat or republican to vote in the general election.  I personally do not see the Christian or social conservative in Sarah Palin.  You should vote your conscience, not other peoples'.  If your vote causes problems at home, simply say you voted differently.|`|XBV6DP84aa	So basically your parents want you to vote for Obama because he's black? I'm sorry but that is ridiculous. Especially if you agree with Palin's views. Don't be a stereotype, vote for whoever the hell you want to vote for. You have no loyalty to Obama because you have the same skin colour. Tell your parents that.   Oh and on a side note, Obama's a lying cheat anyway.|`|LPIRDhJuaa	Well it depends.  Do you feel obligated to vote with your parents?  Yes or no the decision is up to you.  You vote what YOU want.|`|t4d9Jwuhaa	you need to vote for who you want......its very private and no one will ever know if you don't tell.....

I know i couldn't.       always remember those babies don't have a voice yet , we are their voice to be heard! |`|Qv51RS7Naa	My first thought is your mother is acting like a child. You are grown and have the right to vote for whoever you please. If this is going to cause family problems, just simply don't discuss you vote with them. I agree that McCain/Palin is who we need, and you parents probably feel just as strongly for Obama/Biden.  On election day, vote for who you think this country needs. Don't let anyone else influence you. Keep the matter private.      I also think that alot of people are caught up right now in the whole changing history agenda. People, we need to vote for a president that can bring America back. We need to vote for the man(and woman) that has enough knowledge and experience to run this nation, not for Obama because it will change history.|`|AA10407322	Who you vote for is your choice. What happens in the voting booth is just for you to know. Vote for your self not your parents. |`|XGt0umHCaa	It's nobody's business but yours in the the voting booth you have total control. Also the booths are a one person thing you can vote for Donald Duck if you want once the ballots marked and placed in box no one knows how you vote. Follow your head and vote the way you want but if you want to please your parents tell them what they want to hear.|`|owv6gpNIaa	Sweetheart... Grow a backbone.  Your vote is confidential!  The ballot is confidential... you can tell people you voted for Nader and they will never know if it is true or not!  Vote for who YOU think is the best and you don't ever have to tell you parents who you voted for.  There are many many reasons for vote for a candidate over another consider what is really important to you and then go vote with no regrets.  |`|AA10524071	I believe you should vote for whomever you want. But I strongly encourage you to look at the whole picture of who will be affected if McCain/Palin is elected. Without doubt we will be going to war to kill innocent people in their homes~civilian casualties are always very high in wars. Our military is not big enough to go to war, so this will encourage the government to keep people ignorant and in poverty because they need desperate people to join. There has to come a time when wee say the enough with a few old rich white guys who think they are above the laws. Just please look at both sides and pay attention to the negative and positive criticms, then sort out what you believe. PS Obama does not want to kill babies, nor does Biden whose wife and child were killed in an auto accident, they are both devoted family men who are not out to line their own pockets. It's your vote. Good luck!|`|AA11719145	You think maybe you are in a quandary. You want to please your parents, but you want to vote as your heart leads. That seems like a tough one, but it's not really. Here's why:    The right to vote (and it is a right, as well as a privelege) is given to free citizens like us so that we can choose our leaders. You have an obligation to do just that. Choose. Our electoral system would not function if we vote for only who we were told to. The entire concept of electing officials would become a joke. I believe your parents feel that way, too.    Now, I am very happy that you told me you are an African American female. Why? I want you to keep in mind that although African Americans were given the right to vote in 1865, following the Civil War, states did all sorts of things to abridge the right to vote for African-Americans. The main means were seemingly "objective" criteria like "literacy laws," which required that a person be able to read before they could register to vote. Since many African-Americans at the time were illiterate, that effectively prevented their voting. There were many cases before the Supreme Court, mostly in southern states, in which means of blocking the vote were removed.     The real change came during the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, when the last of the racial restrictions were finally removed.     Legally speaking, the right to vote came with the 15th amendment. But socially speaking, it took the Civil Rights movement to make it a reality.     So, as an African American, your choice on election day is extremely precious.    As a female - prior to 1920, you would not have legally been allowed to vote. So you have DOUBLE the reason to go to the polls, make the choices of your own mind and heart, and cast your vote.    I'm sure your folks are reasonable people. They should understand.          |`|gCHFrN2xaa	Your parents should be mad at you. John McCain is a very unchristian human being. Sarah Palin is fake. McCain is gonna start the next War...World War III. Is another war Christian???    If anyone is a true Christian good man it's Barack Obama. He's real. His wife is a Christian woman, a good mother, devoted wife, career woman. You can't even compare Obama to McCain. There's no comparison. Barack Obama is way more respectable and the most qualified person to be our next president. I'm voting for Barack Obama and I'm white.   You should not vote for Obama because you're black or because he's black. But you should vote for Obama because of who he is and the fact that he stands for change in a country that is in a financial crisis.|`|baW9u4yLaa	I'd recommend listening to your parents.    If you're worried about the Christian issue,  I think someone with true Christian values would vote for Obama.  (you know, the Christians who actually give a damn about other people & the general well-being of society)    Only these selfish new-age wealth-is-God Christians would be the types likely to cast a vote for McCain.  (Unfortunately their propaganda does sucker some decent people into mistaking them for the 'good guys' - trust me, they're not)    I suspect your parents can see through the 'Godly' facade of the Republicans and see them for the self-righteous & self serving party that they actually are...|`|zUkviN4Taa	Your 21 and considering voting for who Mommy and Daddy want you to vote for?

I'm sure you've heard people say that it is our obligation as American citizens to vote how we feel or for who we feel would be the best candidate. You do not have to tell your parents who you voted for. I understand that lying goes against most peoples basic instincts when it comes to your parents , but it sounds to me that you can't win here unless you go with how you feel. I wouldn't tell them who I voted for. Just shrug and say I voted for the one I thought was best, or shrug and lie saying I voted exactly as you wanted me to. The point of these elections is freedom of speach. Speak up! I like Obama, but that is me. I like Palin too but I don't always agree with what she has to say.It's my choice though. This election is historical regardless. No woman has ever been vice-president. Don't make it a black/ white issue.Make it an informed issue! Good Luck!|`|7m8ayTLjaa	You should vote for whoever you think is the best person for the job. That is what democracy is all about.

No matter who wins there will be historical signifigance either it being Palin or McCain.   You are old enough to vote, you need to be able to decide on your own.

I've never voted for a Republican in my life, for a variety of reasons. My parents knew that, but they never tried to convince me that I should vote their way. Neither should yours.

Now get out there and vote. |`|qxteTM9Kaa	Vote for who you want.your parents will never know.|`|jLmtqrMmaa	Tell your parents that you're exercising your right to American liberty ... by voting privately and with your own mind.

And I don't even support McCain, but I support people's right to choose. |`|ENBhz7Asaa	You must decide this for yourself.  Pray about it, study the issues, and listen to the important things in this election.  Don't listen to what other people say, or what the commercials say.  Make your decision on what you believe.  This is your first vote, so I sure wouldn't let my parents try to "guilt" me into voting their way, but if you decide that Obama IS the best way vote for him because YOU want too, not because someone got mad and stormed out of the house.  P.S.  Your parents or anyone else doesn't have to know how you voted.  Play coy with anyone that asks because it's none of their business anyway.|`|bMiMBc1haa	The moral majority is neither.....  Don't be sucked into the old views of democrats are immoral etc.  There has been a lier at the helm for the last 8 years.  He sucked up to the christian right and they fell for it!  If McCain is so moral, why was he living with his girlfriend (now wife) when he was still married to his first wife?!?  Palin is a ding bat!  She states she believes in teaching abstinence only, obviously that doesn't work since her teenage daughter is pregnant.  (Just for the record, my 17 y/o was taught ALL THE DETAILS and she is picking out medical schools, not nursery decor).  I guess what I am getting at, is just because someone tells you something, it doesn't mean it is true.    Think about the type of things Jesus did in his life and the lessons he taught.  Jesus was a liberal.  You forgave/tolerated people, helped people etc.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Tell your parents who you vote for is none of their business    Sounds like you have a childish mother    Typical Obama supporter|`|WL3KcegWaa	Vote on the issues, not the historical signifigance of the candidate.    Your parents, with all due respect have their priorities out of whack and it sounds like they are voting for Obama simply because he is black.  That is racist.    Your parents sound a little immature which makes me think that this post is not quite true.  But regardless...    Vote the issues.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	I think your mother needs to take some medication.  You are an adult.  Vote your conscience because YOU have to live with it.

I just voted yesterday, and i voted Mccain....because of his dedication to America those years he spent as a prisoner of war, and that he did not come home as i probably would have when given the chance, but stayed back so another could be released, i do stand on God's principles before my own....You do what you feel is right, and stand by it.

Jeremiah 1:5  "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations."  Remember this God will see who you vote for but your  parents will not.  Newspaper headlines declared a tragic milestone: the overall death toll from the five-year war in Iraq has reached more than 4,000. Also, for every 15 troops wounded in Iraq, there has been one fatality.    The war in Iraq will undoubtedly remain a key issue in the Presidential race. Newsmen and newswomen in particular are likely to focus much attention on that 4,000 fatality figure.    Yet, I doubt whether a single questioner will point out a troubling truth: nearly that many American babies die in a single day from abortion.    One day--nearly 4,000 deaths. A five-year war compressed into a single 24-hour period.    Who will dare ask about an exit strategy for the war going on on our domestic front? Who will interview the grieving post-abortive mothers and fathers? Who will ask the grandparents where their grandchildren have gone? Who will grill candidates at the federal, state, and local level about their support for the war on unborn children and their mothers?    The casualties in this war will not be buried with honors. In fact, they won't receive a funeral at all.    In all likelihood, they won't even have a name, unless their mothers, drawing on their inner courage, attend a post-abortion healing retreat.    Newscasts chronicle the struggles soldiers returning from battle sometimes face in dealing with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder. Women undergoing abortion often have their own post-traumatic disorder to deal with, a disorder they may try to numb through drugs and alcohol.    Where are the discussions about public health policy to deal with the emotional trauma of abortion? How are women to re-adjust to school and work after losing a child in the abortion war?    The next time candidates come knocking on your door asking for your vote, ask them what they intend to do to end the abortion war. The unborn children of America deserve an answer.    Barack Hussein Obama is for Partial Birth Abortion,we must stop him.  I voted for Dems for years  than I seen what Dems did to my City.Now we have  Republicans and things are better here.|`|CZ8szX0jaa	Sarah Palin is not running for president, would you as a fine young christian woman vote for a man who calls his wife the C word in public?|`|paerqxfMaa	That's the beauty of private voting.  Your vote is a personal choice - you don't need to tell ANYONE who you're voting for or who you voted for (including your parents) - AND no one can tell you how to vote.  You are under no obligation to follow your parents wishes when it comes to voting.  That is the whole purpose of a free, private ballot system.|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	I know exactly how you feel.  Any time I disagree politically with my parents, my family, all hell breaks loose and the threats begin -- "you won't be allowed to dinner at our house ever again!"    It's really sad when family takes it that way.  And it's plain silly, unfair, and just wrong of them to think they OWN our vote.  They have no right to order us how to vote.    We have a mind of our own, we have the right as a citizen to vote for whom WE believe to be the better candidate for president.    So you think for YOURSELF -- and you vote for who YOU want.  They don't follow you into the booth, right?  They don't have to know, if you'd like to keep the peace for peace sake.  Just don't tell them.  If I go against my family, which I know it takes a lot of strength to do, I may not tell them, either.|`|Wlt9Ypjkaa	If this post is real, I'd say you should vote for whomever you want. That being said, I don't see how you can say that Palin is a Christian while Obama is not. If that's what you believe, you've been seriously misled. And while I think you should cast your vote on the basis of your own beliefs and not your parents, I have to agree that it makes no sense for a black American to vote Republican. It's no accident that even lifelong Republican and Bush Administration official Colin Powell has announced he's voting for Obama.

ADD To Mahama: If you sat at a party with him as an adult knowing full well that he still held those beliefs, if you allowed him to babysit your children, If you gave a laudatory toast to him and his beliefs....then yes you would be a Nazi, at the very least a sympathizer.    ADD  2 To Mahama: You know as well as I do that it goes much deeper than a dinner party. It was a gathering of like minded people (including Ayres) where they talked negatively about Israel and their collective support for the Palestinians. Additionally Obama contributed to the group of haters that he headed. You are trying to reason something away when there is no way to justify it. I cannot believe there are still people out there who think Obama would be a good or even decent leader for the United States.

"The Los Angeles Times did not publish the videotape because it was provided to us by a confidential source who did so on the condition that we not release it," said the newspaper's editor, Russ Stanton. "The Times keeps its promises to sources."    Jamie Gold, the newspaper's readers' representative, said in a statement: "More than six months ago the Los Angeles Times published a detailed account of the events shown on the videotape. The Times is not suppressing anything. Just the opposite -- the L.A. Times brought the matter to light."    The original article said that Obama's friendships with Palestinian Americans in Chicago and his presence at Palestinian community events had led some to think he was sympathetic to the Palestinian viewpoint on Middle East politics. Obama publicly expresses a pro-Israel viewpoint that pleases many Jewish leaders.    In reporting on Obama's presence at the dinner for Khalidi, the article noted that some speakers expressed anger at Israel and at U.S. foreign policy, but that Obama in his comments called for finding common ground.|`|zR5yI1qfaa	Imagine that, Obama hugging another terrorist?|`|5e5c5c1cfde2ffcdb16e4ce17d31b558aa	Khalidi is not a terrorist that I know of, he just supports terrorist organizations.  Ayers is definitely a terrorist of the homegrown type.  The LA Times won't release the tape because they are the same elitist left wing liberal news media who wants Obama to win and by releasing the tape they may cause him to lose.   |`|Tx2Uk0KVaa	Your sources?  Of course, you don't have any.|`|a5B6pJseaa	Ha..ha....lol................did I hear that someone wants the Obama camp to do the right thing and ask the LA Times to release the tape?

[...] They will believe a lie because they want to believe it's true, or because they are afraid it might be true."    Wizard's First Rule: Chapter 36, Page  397, US Hard Cover (revealed by Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander).    Explanation by Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander: "People are stupid; given proper motivation, almost anyone will believe almost anything. Because people are stupid, they will believe a lie because they want to believe it's true, or because they are afraid it might be true. Peoples heads are full of knowledge, facts, and beliefs, and most of it is false, yet they think it all true. People are stupid; they can only rarely tell the difference between a lie and the truth, and yet they are confident they can, and so are all the easier to fool."   |`|60x7RSebaa	They do not care!

Who hires lawyers? visits doctors? buys medication? travels?    So, small business owners and big business owners and self-made professionals, you try selling something to people who have no money (or credit) and see how far your business goes    See how far your business goes when you have under-educated, over-worked underpaid and unhealthy workers    "If you're wondering why a formerly honorable man like John McCain would build his presidential campaign around issues that are simultaneously beside-the-point, trivial, and dishonest (sex education for kindergartners, lipstick on pigs), the numbers presented here may help to solve that mystery. Since the conventions ended, McCain has mired the presidential race in dishonest trivia because he doesn't want it to focus on what voters say is the most important issue this year: the economy.  There is no secret about any of this. The figures below are all from the annual Economic Report of the President, and the analysis is primitive. Nevertheless, what these numbers show almost beyond doubt is that Democrats are better at virtually every economic task that is important to Republicans."    Politicians Lie, Numbers Don't  And the numbers show that Democrats are better for the economy than Republicans.    http://www.slate.com/id/2199810/|`|roAahzkIaa	they shouldn't|`|JlkWt3Evaa	Because he's gonna tax the heck out of them and they aren't going to be able to afford it, they will have to make that money somewhere, so they cut jobs and higher prices. When consumers stop buying they have no choice, but to cut more jobs or go out of business and that means laying off all employees.     |`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Because that $3000 dollar per new job would not even cover a new employee for two months in most jobs.  Also, the major reason that US companies are expanding in Central Europe and Asia is that those areas are growing.  Most job losses now are due to the economy and to unions.      Finally, there is nothing that a sitting President can do to either create jobs or lose jobs.  It is all about supply and demand in the Country.  Also, there are some jobs that are coming back to the States because of better customer service.|`|F4IjI9qaaa	Don't YOU get it?     Follow this.   That $3,000 tax credit sure isn't going to pay the salary of the person I just hired. In fact, I'm going to have to let go 2 more people because the money that would have covered their salaries is now going to the additional taxes Obama is making my company pay. I'm not sure how we can meet our business obligations because I really needed those two guys I had to cut loose. Six months or so later: No more taxes from my company now that I have to shut the doors and let the rest of my employees go. They won't be paying taxes either but rather pulling in unemployment.

The cost of employing a US citizen is a fraction of what it cost in another country.  Believe me....they are courting companies to come there.

Jobs were created under Bill Clinton's Presidency.    Jobs were loss under George Bush Jr.'s Presidency.    Jobs will be created under Barack Obama's Presidency.|`|ZzyRXvvcaa	Here comes the truth lets see if you will accept it... Obama is going to raise taxes on anyone making over 250k that is most small businesses which mean they will hire less people. Obama is going to give a tax break to people who do not even work and that is called welfare. Comapanies do not create jobs for a 3k rebate, companies create jobs because they are growing and need more help. Hiring workers is not cheap and a rebate is worthless in hiring decisions. Most companies that do business overseas are located right here in the United States they just ship goods in from other countries so, Obama is lying if he says he can stop this because he can not. Right now America had the 2nd higest corporate tax in the world and he wants to raise that. It will only make prices higher and devalue our dollar even more... when the dollar is worth less so is your nominal income and that is the amount of your paycheck you keep. Obama will also raise capital gains tax and bring back the death tax. His plans will destroy our economy. I do not understand why you want America to fail and you are setting us up to fail. You can like Obama and still say his plans are wrong for America... he should try them in Kenya.|`|rKY8Cjmxaa	Barry just makes it up as he goes along doesn't he. He's spending it in his head just like I watched Bush do for eight years. Barry is more like Bush than McCain will ever be!      EDIT  BeachBum:  I am also a small business owner. Give me an environment that causes me to NEED more employees, and you can have my $3000 Barry-credit.  I will have a good hard look at my staff when the Bush tax cuts expire in 2010. In my industry, raising prices to compensate is not an option.    AND NO BARRY FANS, I am not going to take this one on the chin for the "good of the country" particularly since I believe it's NOT GOOD for the country and is tantamount to Socialism! I bet nearly all businesses in the United States stand with me on this issue.|`|pvH363Lbaa	because McCain is filling everyones heads up with lies|`|FXAoIqcfaa	Just another republican scare tactic.

And since there are only four full-timers here, that could be me.    And for the guy who bragged about the jobs created during the Clinton Presidency, those were mostly low-level, McDonalds type jobs for kids.....not for adults.|`|Ba6lYx9Xaa	I just created 300,000 jobs. In a week I will have layed everyone off but me. Send me my check! for 900,000,000|`|VfzlLx29aa	It's the greater implications of his economic policies.  Where is he going to get the $3000 from in order to give a tax credit to these companies?  Therein lies the problem.  He has made many promises, but someone has to pay for them and in spite of what he claims, it will increase the deficit.  By the way, so will McCain's plan.    Get online and do some research and you will see for yourself.  No matter who wins, this country is financially in deep kimchee and that they will have to raise taxes, but the person who is promising the most giveaways will have to do more tax raising.  That is an inevitable fact!|`|fh12fkNWaa	Because it's irrational and an idea planted by McCain himself. Clearing anyone whose studied Obama's plans can see they would stimulate jobs here at home.

EJIDB2kIaa	I remember it.  He said he wouldn't run because he didn't think he had the experience necessary to be President.  Guess he gained it in that year though.|`|ME6iuKvaaa	Considering everything else, this little fib is inconsequential.  |`|4ouGKkMJaa	Does anyone remember Joe Biden saying he wouldn't associate with either McCain or Obama?|`|jFYuN95Raa	Yes,  he wouldn't run because he wanted to learn his job in the senate first.  He also lied about using public funds for campaigning.  He also lied that he didn't know Ayers was a terrorist.  |`|4pM3jlzwaa	Yes, it's on You Tube. Biden also criticized Obama as unfit to be President, and Biden said he has no ambitions to run as a VP as well. Dems are all lyers! This is all on You Tube. Go watch.|`|cpmZmw8Kaa	Yeah, I remember when Hillary said the same thing.    And I remember when McCain said he wouldn't run anymore.|`|hq0SecvTaa	No I believe he said if he were to lose this election he wouldn't ever run again. he doesn't believe in going twice|`|ylimD1yYaa	I searched the Oprah archives and found nothing matching.|`|Cgyxmk4Iaa	EVEN if he did then im glad he changed his mind    Thank you !!!!!!|`|45a773de89c6b6a94a5780801566c620aa	You were drinking to much again; it was Michelle that said he would not run for president not OBAMA.

At least that is the reason that she did not have McCain or Palin on.|`|cd67d699c861d2ec280e821f26ece8feaa	I do remember but you have to understand.  Obama is a liar, a bigot and an example of Affirmative Action gone awry.  He has accomplished nothing in his life that wasn't handed to him sort of like most of hollywood. He may very well get elected and as I have been telling my classes we may very well deserve him.  America has not had a leader like him since Carter and many of us remember how well that turned out.  |`|Hjwp1yGWaa	There is a difference between changing one's mind and contradicting prior statements, it is called a lie.  If he wasn't sure, he should have stated that, instead of denying it then doing it, lets hear it for Constitutional Lawyers and their obligation to be moral and ethical, and perfect for the Highest Post in the Free World.  Just a small taste of things to come.  But his issues show us that he is not ethical, nor moral, nor even honest, but let's vote for him anyway and see what happens.  I hope Michelle doesn't mind her husband's discretion's(sound a little like Clinton, or even Bush for that matter) and bending of the truth, we all know what it led to for Bill, let's see where Obama takes it.|`|uzf7nuLnaa	Can we sue him for breach of promise?|`|bkWLRUBTaa	It does not matter because he is going to loose anyways.

It doesn't exactly matter at this point, does it?  He obviously decided to run after all.|`|2P18wyECaa	Does anyone else find it disturbing that the same woman who just recently had a scandel on her show because she couldn't weed out a liar on her show is suddenly all behind Obama?|`|68149b1f13e1ba3a68e7e708172ff96baa	I think I remember after the 2000 primaries when McCain said he wouldn't run again...     Lets count the people who have said this..    Nader  Teddy Roosevelt  FDR  Biden  John Edwards  McCain  Obama..      These people all say that.. But when it comes down to it, they really feel that they want to.|`|nO1I48WIaa	I recall Hillary saying she was not going to run but as usual I missed the Oprah show.|`|AA12358300	Voters don't REMEMBER!!!  Candidates always FORGOT!!    Hilary said she wouldn't run and she ran  Biden said Obama does not fit for Commander in Chief and he is VP candidate..|`|8po0AtQBaa	Who cares?  Do you remember when McCain said he would run a clean campaign?  Its really clean when you say that racists people are the most patriotic people in the nation.  (The Murtha Syndrome).  Also, not making any comment when people are shouting terrorist, holding up monkey dolls with Obama on them, etc. etc. etc.  Just stop the madness.|`|lklwmGh6aa	2002 Ok. this took me forever to find so you better read it...I remember it was soo funny when McCain was on SNL it was a Meet the Press skit where Tim Russert was asking him if he had plans to run again.  The whole thing is super funny, but the end is this...    Tim Russert: Let's talk about 20-28.     Sen. John McCain: I'll be 90.     Tim Russert: Alright. It's 2028.. genetic engineering has extended the human lifespan to 200 years. Would a relatively young John McCain challenge a re-animated Jimmy Carter zombie?     Sen. John McCain: Now, President Carter's been a great humanitarian.     Tim Russert: So, John McCain would back down? Are you afraid of Carter eating you?     Sen. John McCain: I don't think that's an accurate-     Tim Russert: So, you're a candidate?     Sen. John McCain: No.. no..|`|rSHDuSsLaa	Present.|`|EueaG0EBaa	guess he chnged his mind.
pQxsIysXaa	Don't you know that in order to run for President you have to turn in your official Birth Certificate and other government-issued documents to the government? It's people with your ignorance that give Americans a bad reputation.|`|AA11409272	You are making a statement about what Republicans think then contradicting yourself by referencing what Republicans think. What's wrong with this?|`|zoNJTKUdaa	Yes and they keep defending the Rat.  It's just like Michael Jackson isn't a child molester,they keep defending him too!    There is still 7 cases in court waiting to be heard.  He is a lawyer and can keep these cases on hold and still not show the documents.  Why doesn't he show what needs to be shown?What's he hiding?  America is getting tired of being graded on curves because ethnic groups can't compete with white people.This is just another case of "your picking on him because he's black."  The reason the major talk shows and the major media hasn't picked up on it is because it isn't a well-known fact,just as soon as a judge with the balls to make a decision then you will see the media pick up on this story.If the media picks up on it now they will be protested against and they don't want it right now.|`|Q1wNftSqaa	You do realize that his law suit over citizenship is brought on by a very prominant democrat, right? Not a Republican.|`|AA11746917	If your argument holds true, then why isn't Obama's birth certificate a matter of public record ? Why are the authorities in Hawaii refusing to make it public? If he has nothing to hide, then why all the secrecy?|`|Gzd7iwN0aa	Then he should give the Supreme Court his original birth certificate right? Berg filed his appeal last week and Obama could clear this up quickly. Makes you wonder why he doesn't and keeps fighting to not show it to the very people who elected him|`|RbbqhvQYaa	I agree that this was a bad issue to try to defeat Obama in the election. But why all the secrecy from Obama?
63e2b17b3164430761f3403345c1c9cbaa	It doesn't mean she hates this country as everyone loves to say. What she means is that for the first time in her Adult life, America, which is still a racist country(especially judging by y!) is moving past it's hate and showing the people that a man of color can be elected in this country and that people of all races can vote for this man.  You are fooling yourself if you think that this country is or was perfect. Far from it. Some people feel that just because they themselves arent racist and the fact that they dont see it, means that America has moved past it's race issues. It obviously has not!  Im tired of people saying you hate America just for pointing out the flaws in this government. People say freedom of speech, but what they really mean is freedom to speak and think like them!|`|etKzA9lKaa	She means idiot racists have made her disillusioned but now she has hope because ppl are finally thinking beyond race and with their brains!|`|OAqTt0nsaa	She meant it was nice to be away from the mirrors.|`|AA12358300	It implies that only if she sees some success from her husband or any black people she knows, or else, she finds it difficult to live with other race because she has low self esteem issue...    That is a nice way to say that she is a racist!      Watch out she may say something about hating America if Obama loses or Obama losing approval rating...|`|EiH8BeYcaa	She is only telling you where she is at . She hates white people .|`|EcrCIqP7aa	When she said that she was never proud to be an American, even though it more than likely affirmative action that got her into collage. And the American way that let her succeed in America.    I think she should go back to Africa and find her tribe and see how they would welcome her. Then she could stay there and be a proud African.|`|uBqYq4CMaa	She isn't a professional politician, so she was not guarding her words.  It was a powerful moment for her, and she was being a human instead of a showpiece.  I don't honestly see whats wrong with it.  A lot of people don't consider their situation until some epiphany or galvanizing moment.  She never said she was ever ashamed of America, as I think it has been construed by some nationalists.|`|64oCu9Jmaa	She meant since Barrack got the endorsed she is happy for the power, other than that she still hates America.|`|IxaDmj3xaa	In the first quote she was talking about people getting out to vote and the passion they were showing about politics, and in that context that was the first time she was proud.    Never heard the other quote.  |`|R3HjDrRJaa	what do you expect, we enslaved her race for 200 years, and we genocided another race that originally lived, here, your proud of that?|`|JVfTjRE7aa	It means she hates America, and she should get her black azz on a plane outta here.|`|OrbC6v8Saa	how is "for the FIRST TIME IN MY ADULT LIFE, I'm proud of my country" taken out of context?    She didn't say "I've never been more proud."    She was not proud of her country until just recently. She must have been a bitter, angry woman.|`|QiLkZtjfaa	Means now that obama has a real shot as the president,She is now proud for the first time.Thats like only being proud of your child only when he/she does well.When in fact you should always be proud.Just like marriage through thick and thin,For better or for worse.|`|s6HJgBm5aa	she means that she's happy we finally got a black leader  and we are now on top lol  sike nah she meant that she's happy white ppl not looking atour race no more but brains  hell..white ppl need her husband to bail america out  it aint the white house no more  lol  |`|Gf4ajcoNaa	she means shes proud that her husband is powerful and doesn't like anything else

But Biden might have trouble since he isn't aware JOBS has 4 letters and not 3.|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	That's part of this messy thing we call a "Democracy."  That's why it's important to fund programs that actually promote education, instead of some corrupted propagandized agenda.    Think of this for a moment: How often do you hear conversations about your Representative and their voting record? Now, how often do you hear people talking about their favorite TV series, or, their favorite video game?    If people spent a TENTH of the time following the trail of their representatives as they do these other entertainments, think of the impact THAT would have!    Tip O'Neill, former Speaker of the House during the 80s once said, "All politics is local." If we can put down the remote control, he may have something there....|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	It would be nice, however it's illegal.|`|Ya2j2ENaaa	Yes.  They should - and if you got that on the ballot I'd vote for it!!|`|mMo2hwUBaa	Yes, and their test should be a willingness to sacrifice all they have for the good of their nation.|`|oojO4WAraa	No. That is not the way the system is set up.  Someone doesn't have to be a knucklehead to vote the same way you do, or to vote for the other guy.  Seems to me like some pretty smart, educated people are voting the wrong way (different than me).  |`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	No.  These have only be used to disenfranchise voters... there's no requirement that voters be well informed.  That's the sad reality.|`|BpT0t1qMaa	No it would not be fair to the obama supporters.         McCain/Palin  '08|`|TqBpKMbcaa	No, our constitution states that ALL men are created equal. Should the education system be better? You betcha!|`|94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	Back of a bus? Damn, when did "eenie meanie miny mo" go out of style? lol|`|1e2cbc85030051f1633edefe58d546c6aa	Good idea, but it would be bastardized by the far extremes of both parties to discourage voting.|`|RGdZYbNkaa	I completely agree with you!    let think of it with this logic... people born here go through so many years of schooling minimum, and during these years they should be learning these basic concepts. however, it amazed me how my senior year of high school students in my Government class didn't know the term lengths for representatives, senators, and presidents. if you factor in those who get their citizenship have to take a simple test about American history, we can hope that the voting population is relatively educated on our nation's history and the current issues at hand. sadly, this is not the case.    although it would take longer at the polls, i think there should be an entrance quiz to be able to vote in that election. maybe 5 randomly generated questions on a computer (which would test the population's computer skills, hm, double whammy) and if you don't get 4/5 you can't vote. I think that's fair. someone who is ignorant to our nation's basic history and the current issues should not vote because, like you say, they will be negating the votes of those who aren't quite so ignorant.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	You my friend are correct.  That would be expensive.  A better use of these funds would be in Education.  But since Education is a Social Theme you may find resistance.    The Constitution is something everyone should know.  Unfortunately students are only taught what is necessary to pass their states tests so the state can get funds for next year.  This is sad but a reality.  If we can just keep Democrats in charge for the next 20 years or so our country would again be a proud Democracy.  Republicans only know "You do this for me, and I will give you that".    Mathew 21:12  The republicans got their tables turned over for making a business where no business was needed.    We don't need Socialism.  We need to be more Social.    I voted for "That One".        |`|1afc54bafdec686e0044f16ffa4d60abaa	Yes they should...especially in the south.|`|3ao6N2Szaa	No, it's the american way.|`|0cMZUMIcaa	100% YES.    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *     Americans Flunk Simple 3-Question Political Survey  http://www.livescience.com/culture/08101...    20/20 Some People Shouldn't Vote:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvl0lqhCV...      * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *     20/20 - Politically Incorrect Guide To Politics - part 1:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Phs6Cwnut...    20/20 - Politically Incorrect Guide To Politics - part 2:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e11-_cE63...    20/20 - Politically Incorrect Guide To Politics - part 3:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuL8teeuJ...    20/20 - Politically Incorrect Guide To Politics - part 4:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Pu6cT6IC...    20/20 - Politically Incorrect Guide To Politics - part 5:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTI9r4pUY...    20/20 - Politically Incorrect Guide To Politics - part 6:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWVLr8Y18...    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   |`|AA12358300	Policticans should be required for lie detector test!|`|gwftvHf0aa	The left is going to cite some reference to Jim Crow laws....they're wrong...people are voting for Obama only because of the color of his skin.

It's a dangerous game because putting barriers to voting allows the unscrupulous to 'invent' reasons to block undesirable voters from others parties or views.    My opinion? Yes. I think a person should need to demonstrate an actual knowledge of both candidates or a basic knowledge of an issue before their vote is counted. Based on factual information and not party lines.     ie, a little ten question test asking the basic positions of the candidates based on their voting history, or of the costs involved in propositions, etc.|`|iEneyLM5aa	The "spin" you refer to is why tests were outlawed.|`|GXjneLC6aa	Yes! I've been saying this for years!  But I don't think it should be a history test.

What really bothers me is when you hear people like those Harlem voters interviewed on Howard Stern that don't know anything other than a black man is running. They were willing to support extremely conservative (pro-life, stay in Iraq, Palin) positions when they were told that it was what Obama believed in. That makes me sick.|`|eqDGISI5aa	No, it would be impossible. Too many people from too many backgrounds...|`|K8MLXa1laa	voters should be required to pass test now because your candidate is losing stop crying please. idiotnoir learn how to spell dumb a$$. your iq is about 80 with that comment. let me guess you speak french noir french for black.|`|fa90f41bf057569ed8a64c39315f598eaa	Actually, if you don't need to pass a test to become a parent, get married, or buy a home, why do you think you need to pass a test just to vote.  All of those things are way more important than voting, and the average dumdum can do them.  Voting is a privilege, not a right. Intelligence has no part in it, although common sense would be helpful.|`|oZdX2wkqaa	Absolutely not. While your idea may sound sensible, it raises all sorts of possibilities for discrimination.    Shortly after the slaves were freed, it was suggested that literacy be a requirement for voting. While, in theory, having a voting populace who can all read is great, in reality all this would have done was completely removed the impact of the newly freed, poorly educated slaves on elections. They would have been denied a fundamental freedom of being a US citizens right after they were given it.    Educating the voting public about as many issues as possible is incredibly important, but it cannot be a requirement.  So no, there should never, ever be any requirements for voting other than being a citizen of the United States. Any time anyone ever suggests any sort of restriction for voting, just look at the demographics of the people that restriction would eliminate, and the majority of them will be on the opposite side of the fence from the person who suggested it.    "The left is going to cite some reference to Jim Crow laws....they're wrong..."  Yes, how dare we bring up a completely relevant historical example from our own nation's past.  Learning from past mistakes is unAmerican!

NrrxdAfWaa	"J'entends ceux qui manifestent...    euh non, c'est dj pris, ?a ;-)    Je lis plusieurs allusions  la libert d'expression... mais il ne faut pas confondre la France et les Etats-Unis non plus !  Ce sont les Etats-Unis qui ont inscrit la libert d'expression au premier amendement de leur constitution :    "Le Congrs ne fera aucune loi qui touche l'tablissement ou interdise le libre exercice d'une religion, ni qui restreigne la libert de parole ou de la presse, ou le droit qu'a le peuple de s'assembler paisiblement et d'adresser des ptitions au gouvernement pour le redressement de ses griefs."    La France, quant  elle, se fie aux droits de l'Homme (dclaration universelle-article 19 et dclaration de 1789-article 11) :    "La libre communication des penses et des opinions est un des droits les plus prcieux de l'homme ; tout citoyen peut donc parler, crire, imprimer librement, sauf  rpondre de l'abus de cette libert dans les cas dtermins par la loi."    J'attire votre attention sur les derniers mots. La loi prvoit en effet des limiter cette libert aux propos incitant  la haine raciale, nationale ou religieuse et relevant de l'appel au meurtre, qui sont des dlits interdits par la loi. Sont galement nomms les principes de diffamation et calomnie.    Par consquent, au strict regard de la loi, certaines interventions sur Yahoo Q/R devraient tre interdites.  Mais bien avant la loi, il y a une notion qui semble tre oublie par beaucoup d'intervenants : le RESPECT.    Ah oui, pour ?a, il faut avoir un minimum de qualits humaines et ne pas se laisser tenter par le c?t obscur : agressivit, haine, colre,...|`|7qmOFEYdaa	C'est nul, cela n'apporte rien et souvent cela ne fait qu'engendrer des tensions.

Obama never said he was giving a "95% tax cut." He said he was giving a tax cut to 95% of Americans. There's a huge difference. |`|lECv9Adaaa	His plan is to let Bush's tax cuts expire, and THEN "cut taxes" himself.    The reason everybody is upset about Bush's tax cuts is because he cut taxes for everybody.  The highest tax bracket went down from 39.6% to 35%.  The lowest tax bracket went down from 15% to 10%, which means those that paid the least taxes still had their taxes cut by 33%.  In addition, the Bush tax cuts took many people off the tax rolls completely.    The Bush tax cuts are supposed to expire in 2010.  Republicans want to make them permanent.  Democrats want them to expire, resulting in a huge tax hike for everybody.    This leaves open the possibility that Obama's "tax cuts" won't be as deep as Bush's, leading to a net tax increase.|`|ef92a8f5bdc42f6910a61afbaa79b597aa	First of all, it's not a "95% tax cut" that is being proposed, it's a tax cut for 95% OF AMERICANS.  There's a big difference.      Second of all, who knows if he plans to make good on that promise.  Who cares.  The fact is, neither one of these candidates will shrink the size of the federal government, MARK MY WORD.  That means that any "tax break" will be funded by another hidden tax, INFLATION.  Meaning, of course, that the Federal Reserve will continue to print out more cash to lend to the federal government, which drives down the value of the dollar.  TAX BREAKS MEAN SQUAT WITHOUT CUTTING SPENDING.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	  way to get the quote wrong...    it was 95% of americans wont pay a penny more in taxes.      and NO ONE!!!!!!! could EVER claim to cut taxes by 95%.  seriously.  oh my god like, seriously, dude, any politician that said that would get locked up in the nut house|`|2bf7b1928da0ba8574b96d3c8eb7ff68aa	I do    I believe he will cut middle class taxes  just like I believe McCain will cut Millionaires taxes|`|Svanlzg7aa	Too many people still believe in fairytales.|`|zhk8o514aa	Remember that speech "read my lips no new taxes" HOG WASH    And that goes for both parties as well.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	Wrong.

However, I doubt one man can make parents be better parents. |`|uEyxjAdcaa	If he really cares about "the children", he would get government out of the education business. |`|AA11746917	How about "fixing" it so that people who shouldn't be parents don't have children!    I totally agree. We hear a lot about how teachers and schools are failing our children, but not once is it mentioned that parents are failing as well. The parent component is sorely misssing from our schools. Until that is addressed, we will not be successful in properly preparing students for the future.|`|261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	Schools in their absurd leftist philosophy have come to the conclusion children should not fail. They are not forced to work hard or fail in school. The parents see good grades, The parents are too busy (both working to pay taxes) to look into the matter deeply. Their kid is on the honor roll, why should they worry? A few failing grades would be a wake up call to hundreds of thousands of parents. Students learn laziness and lack of effort is just as good as studying. They learn the system cheats to pass them along. many kids, by the time they get into the upper levels of High school, simply find the work too hard and they drop out.     Liberals when they see something that needs "fixing" ask what the government can do. Conservatives ask what the government did to cause the problem. Of course, the fix is to stop abusive taxation and let the mighty engines of a free economy pull the ship out of the abyss. The major problem as I see it, is morals. It always is, to some extent, when something goes wrong. As taxes on the rich increase, the rich force employees to work harder for less and pay more for less. It just gets passed down to the working class. This causes mom to go back to work and spend less time raising children properly. If dad earned enough to support a family, many women would opt to stay home and care for their kids. Instead, the harder life gets for them, the more they wish to tax the rich. Go figure.     The saddest part is trapping children in leftist state schools and filling them full of liberal propaganda and changing the definitions of words indoctrinating them into believing socialist "new think" so they never learn how to think for themselves. That is the root of the Obama abomination. It's been going on for a generation with revisionist history, right under our noses! Hayek, Mises, Bastiat, Rand, are all but forgotten.    All elections are advance auctions on stolen goods - H. L. Mencken (another forgotten name)|`|bTAHfgbgaa	Hmmmm.....    Those are tough questions and I don't think there are any easy answers.     In response to, "The weakness is in the lower income brackets where parents often have dropped out of school. What could turn that around?"  If the weakness is in the lower income brackets and is a result of not being educated then I would say we need to find ways to help these parents by going directly to the source - them.  Maybe the parents could be talked to get ideas of how they could be helped.  Some parents may not want or accept help which could be another problem.  In this case, you'd need to somehow figure out what would motivate them to want to change.        In response to your main question, "Should Obama Fix Schools by Fixing the Parents who Don't Make Their Kids Study?", I think it may not hurt to move in that direction.  I think we need to look at what has been done so far to make this work and is it working?  If it's not working, then we need to try another approach.  If that means Obama or the govt. stepping in to solve this problem then so be it unless there's a better alternative.    |`|tY3bXlGyaa	No, the govt cant make parents do anything, thats why its important to promote morals and values in the school system.|`|aPtk8iEXaa	omg...now you want Obama to do our job as being a parent?

So yes, we must get to the root & the rest just takes over.|`|k6hicodfaa	Although parental involvement is critical in a how a child's education plays out I have no idea what you mean by 'fixing'.|`|9PAavWnyaa	That would be a good start if by "fixing" you mean getting the parents involved with their child's education and taking responsibility for their behavior. |`|XGHLrOklaa	I think parenting should be taught at school at a young age.  Being a parent doesn't come with an instruction guide so for some people it's hard or they just don't get it.  But your right parent's need to be on their kids more than some of them are.  But a lot of the problem is that both parent's really have to work or if they have a single parent most of the time they have to work two jobs.  But I also think schools should take that into consideration and do a better job at inspiring these kids.  I know my daughter's teachers aren't very inspirational they are just trying to shove things down their throat so they will do well on the fcats so the school will get more funding. |`|60x7RSebaa	Obama can not fix anyone. The lazy will remain lazy. The irresponsible will remain irresponsible. The underachiever will remain an underachiever. He will simply throw more money at the parasites of society and it will change nothing. It takes will to want something better.

Le mot "totalitarisme" s'est forg dans un contexte politique prcis : celui de la lutte des libraux et des dmocrates-chrtiens italiens contre certaines pratiques lectorales fascistes en 1923-1924.    On le retrouve utilis dans la presse britannique des annes 20 o il dsigne un certain mode d'exercice du pouvoir fond sur un systme de parti unique ngateur du parlementarisme. En Italie, F. Nitti dnonce le primat de l'ide de force dans le fascisme et le bolchevisme qui nourrit une aversion commune pour la dmocratie marque, elle, par la tolrance. De plus, ils sont destructeurs de tout pluralisme conomique et social, ils se posent en mouvements militaires contre des masses civiles ainsi que le dmantlement commun des organisations politico-conomiques des travailleurs.    H. Arendt pense que Le mode de domination totalitaire a une "essence" : la terreur. Si la terreur est consubstantielle au rgime totalitaire, elle n'est donc pas accidentelle car issu d'un parti unique avec chef charismatique, idologie globalisante, appareil policier, conomie planifie, monopole des moyens de communication, monopole des instruments de violence.

News companies are companies, they report on what people want to read, so people will purchase their product. If they didn't report about what people wanted to read, they wouldn't be in business long.  If the news is biased, it is because society is, and the news comapnies are just relying on free-market economics.    Now right-wingers start disliking free-market economics when it isn't in their favor lol.|`|Nzchak7gaa	I think John McCain is a evil liar.|`|lxK8kaxOaa	And your point is?|`|tPEUmq2zaa	yes the liberal drive by media is a black sympathizer. |`|f2de36b10c040da3be6777da12ad6529aa	so if they lie and say it's neck and neck like fox news does  that will make them nonbiased?|`|AA10265333	Yeah, that's how most of the mainstream media is.|`|4c2e5d9e10f23cb24ac709dd1d50dfe6aa	That's funny.  That's like saying someone is biased against eating plastic or stabbing themselves in the eye.|`|rT4JiEHAaa	Yes, I have even posted a similar question. Yahoo is most defiantly left of center.|`|AA11519766	Obama has a funny name, McCain has a funny military record, Obama is a multi-cultural man of African and American descent raised by white people, McCain was incredibly spoiled growing up and untouchable, Obama knows a man in the Chicago political circle who was once associated with a terroristic type anti-government organization in the 70s, McCain was closely involved with criminal activity in political racketeering and fraud scandals among others (The Keating 5, religious pandering, mafia ties), Obama was a smoker, McCain was an adulterer and an avid gambler, After college, Obama jumped off the career path a few years to work with helping poor families, seeing to it that asbestos is removed from their homes, etc, McCain crashed several planes and lost one other in a freak accident (before being shot down in one) and spared and given medical treatment because they immediately learned he was the Navy Admiral's own son, Obama's wife was born to a low-income working class family and went on to graduating Princeton and Harvard, McCain's first wife was a former swimsuit model that became disfigured in an automobile accident while John was in Vietnam, after returning, the marriage failed and one month after his DIVORCE, he married his mistress, a rich beer heiress and former rodeo queen who would later become entangled in drug scandals (was caught paying her doctor for bad scripts to support her drug addiction), both of the current wives are known for their fashion sense, Obama graduated from Harvard Law School where he was the first ever African American president of the Harvard Law Review, McCain was known by his peers as a party animal and a bad pilot in his military schools, breaking school records ...on demerits and literally finished in the bottom 1% of his class in Annapolis...    The point is, you can paint ANY picture you want, nobody is perfect, but don't think for a second that the media is so biased towards either one of them that they are somehow just making one out to be a saint and the other as a reject because they certainly could. Anybody thinking they know everything about these candidates because of the media, DOESN'T. The media has been reasonably fair to both candidates considering everything and they have been surprisingly quiet about other things which could be potentially destructive to the candidate(s)... The media has its limits I guess you could say.    You obviously take for granted exactly how biased the media really could be if they wanted to be.|`|ALBieW9Yaa	The associated press writes most of the news columns and they are pretty even keel just saying it like it is.|`|AgIMqbc1aa	No?|`|2iLq10Ygaa	Everyone trashes the GOP these days except their mouthpiece, Fox News.     The country is messed up because of 28 years of GOP policies.|`|toqRMz8faa	Uhhh...do you really think that Yahoo news writes their own news reports? They are mostly just AP wire stories, so if you want to accuse an organization with Bias you need to target the AP. Incidentaly, the chairman of the board of the AP is Republican.    So if even republicans are biased against McCain, that should tell you something.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	nost media sites are endorsing obama simply because he is too far ahead on the polls for mccain to catch up (unless mccain steals the elections)  and that is what the people want.     if mccain DOES Steal the election - there may be riots.     yes its bias - but its so close to the election it doesnt really matter.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	FYI-Obama is part owner. I'm serious. He purchased part of yahoo about a month ago. At least so it was reported.|`|AA12182751	Ummmm yeah.    Why do you think that a loser like Obama, with all the problems and scandals he has, is being pushed through the media, getting a skate on his past? Democrats just want a Democrat in office so they can push their crap through, and we have no choice.    A vote for Obama, is a vote to give up our civil liberties.

McCain picked her for all the wrong reasons, and that's become more obvious by the day. To appease the far right conservative base, to hopefully lure Hillary Clinton fans just because she's a woman... all the while overlooking that not just does she have no experience with national politics, she's had no interest in it either.    I think the way to put this in perspective is... look at Bush. For all his faults, and for whatever people think of Cheney, clearly he picked Cheney because he thought he'd be a good person to have govern beside him. Which is what a VP is supposed to be. No one in their right mind thinks McCain picked Palin for anything other than political calculations. If it were really up to him, if he didn't look at polls.. do you think Palin would have been in his top 500 in terms of choices?

Our enlisted men take an oath:  "I, _____, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God." (Title 10, US Code; Act of 5 May 1960 replacing the wording first adopted in 1789, with amendment effective 5 October 1962)."    While they swear to follow the president's orders, the first part takes precedence:  "I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign AND DOMESTIC."    If Obama and Congress truly try to enact their own socialist agenda, contrary to the fundamental freedoms and liberties that our Constitution establishes by law, then our own military is actually REQUIRED BY OATH to defend us against them, since they would become domestic enemies of the United States.  How that would take place -- whether by coup or by simple arrest -- depends on how far Obama and Congress overstep their authority.    Bush had one thing going for him -- a majority support within the military.  Obama will not have that.    Clinton made mistakes and was never liked by the military, but he never overstepped his authority.  (Gingrich and the Republican majority saw to it that he did not.)  But Obama, Reid, and Pelosi have already promised that they plan on reworking the nation into their radical "communist socialist vision".  While it is a frightening thought, our military will NEVER allow this to happen.    All it takes is ONE patriotic soldier.    
AA12134591	First of all, this line you've used as a "question" is the tag-line of a very widely distributed "joke" that has come directly from the RNC.     Next, the Republican fiscal irresponsibilities of the last eight years coupled with the tax abatement for the wealthiest people in the country have created enough "homeless people" within the last two years, that if 'homelessness' has any sway in the polls, they have just lost the election anyway.    And, after the elections, there will be enough unseated Republicans that will be "homeless" .... that they ought to be praying that their biggest nightmare of an Obama presidency turns out to be true.

And McCain is better for America.  You think Obama will actually protect us in a time of crisis?  NO!  If we are attacked, he'll just say "OMG WE NEED WORLD PEACE!" and send Al qaeda lollipops as a peace offering.   C'mon guys, McCAIN for the win!!!

Nothing will change because the same people will stay in power. They don't care who wins because they own both candidates.

CgTwW7H2aa	I think Biden is correct. Few people had heard of Kennedy, Carter, Clinton, or GW Bush before they became president. In the first year of their administration they were all tested 1) Kennedy in the Bay of Pigs; 2) Carter with the Arab oil embargo and the Iran hostage crisis; 3) Clinton with the first World Trade Center bombings; and 4) GW Bush and the 9-11-01 attacks on the World Trade Center. Obama will be tested by someone as a matter of fact because he is new to this game and the world will be watching. Obama has not had any executive experience so he will have to go through a lot of on the job training. The last 5 presidents had at least some executive experience before being elected. Personally, I think Joe Biden would make a better president than Obama.|`|dGwa8sFPaa	Is Joe Biden psychic? I think he was running off at the mouth, as is his habit. |`|gRtmFa1maa	Every president needs on the job training. Every president is tested because stuff is always happening around the world.    I don't recall the Republicans being too concerned about GWB lack of  experience and intellect.    Certainly Obama has the better temperment and intelligence to handle a foreign policy. That is why so many conservatives are supporting Obama. McCain has one presidential job, which was picking a Vice Presidential candidate. He bombed big time. Even he realizes it now as she goes off message and clearly is in it for herself at this point. We don't need a guy who gambles with his decision making process.     WE need a calm steady intelligent leader.

It's called 'campaigning'.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	As far as a I know McCain has never served as President either, anyone in their first term will need training.  I do have faith in Obamas ability to choose a first rate staff and Cabinet for his administration.  He seems to be someone who looks before he leaps, and plans well.  He chose Biden to counter the main complaint I had against him, which was that he was short on DC experience, Biden has lots of that, and has served for a number of years on Foreign services committees. Another shortcoming of Obamas.  Contrasting that with McCains choice of Palin for president and you can easily see why, given that is their first choice of a presidential nature, I decided to go with Obama.  Palin brings nothing but  the base of the party to McCain, it was a political move, not a move that truly put the well being of the nation first.  The commercial about being tested that statement Biden made?  Only part of it is used, the conclusion Biden reached was that he though Obama was up to the job.    If you choose to take issue with the way Biden put it, then yes during the campaign he said many things, thats the nature of running against someone, you must make the case that you will be better than they, inasmuch as they are both intelligent men I'm not worried just because Biden may have put too bluntly what many people think about all the candidates.  I am consoled though by the thought that the last man to actually have experience in office, Bush in the second term, did so badly that its got people thinking maybe experience isn't so great after all.  Maybe we need to consider the man more than the job experience.|`|afikdpZoaa	It is just too bad that all those Democrats voted in the Republican primaries.    I will not forget or forgive McCain for calling me a racist and a bigot for opposing his Amnesty / Open Borders / North American Union plan.      (If Mexico and/or Canada want to become States of the United States, they can apply for such status as prescribed in the Constitution.)    We truly have a "lesser of two evils" situation.      My State will almost certainly go for McCain, so I can vote for a 3rd party candidate.      I feel sorry for Conservatives in "battle ground" States.  They will just have to hold their noses and vote for Sarah Palin.|`|DsEEATKSaa	"Intelligent statements" and "Joe BIden" are phrases rarely uttered in the same sentence.

To me, that sounds like a statement that Obama is going to roll over on some foreign policy issues and give up.  Can you say retreat in A*stan??  Recognize that Iran has a right to build nuclear weapons?  Cut off aid to Israel and give the sums to Hamas?|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Biden had stated this in the primaries. Once he became the VP nominee it appeared that he had changed his position. Or this is what Obama supporters chose to believe anyway. Recently he was caught in a candid moment once again showing his lack of faith in Obama's experience and ability. Frankly Biden's revised position after the primaries appears to be a typical election year conversion. However, I don't know if Biden even knows what Biden believes and whether he has any faith in anyone including himself. Remember that he also stated that Hillary would have been a better VP nominee. The point I am making here is that I don't know if Biden is the person you should be basing your judgments on regarding Obama.|`|wEOJyEw0aa	For a Guy that's Not Ready He killed McCain in every Debate.All McCain is ready to do Is take off his training wheels that Bush put on him 8 years Ago and continue the Failed Polices for the Next 4 years.Look what you got With an Experienced President.

He then turned around and announced  he was running for the office of President just a short 2 years later.

However, there is a more complex reason why it's not even close.  First, the economy taking a complete nosedive.  Polls consistently show that Americans trust Obama more than McCain on the economy.  Look at the first debate, it was supposed to be on foreign policy,however, the economy took up half of the debate.  Then the pick of Sarah Palin was horrible.  All it did was excite the base.  Then when she turned out to be a complete idiot, even the base started getting worried.  Finally, in the end John McCain tried to smear Obama, which turned a lot of independents off.  All in all McCain's campaign had little chance thanks to Bush, however, if Palin would've been the "messiah" the Republicans envisioned and if the war in Iraq would've dominated the headlines, McCain would be in better position right now.|`|NbJPW0Smaa	because hes better. . .  duh|`|WQS0lvuAaa	because he is whats best for this country and the world|`|AA12358300	1. Bush  2. McCain's Age  3. He is black -- attract more votes  4. Palin not likable among most liberals and independent  5. Change as he said,

We don't need a socialist with white hate in his heart.|`|R85r70Osaa	McCain|`|FXWI7L5raa	Obama. At least he has less of a chance of dying of a heart attack during the inauguration and he doesn't have a complete moron for VP.|`|AA12358300	McCain is lesser evil  but    He is way too old..., i am afraid he will die before half of his term if he gets elected    |`|AA11885257	McCain only wants to help himself and his wealthy CEO's at least Obama wants to help the poor. So I say Obama is less Evil than McCain|`|2ec37da908dc97c64963526d9884f7fcaa	Write in RON PAUL  ! |`|8MUkunBiaa	McCain will honor the constitution and protect the country.  He is certainly a centrist with a long proven history of working in the middle of the Republican and Democrat Parties.  McCain isn't my first choice and I only agree with him about 60% of the time though he is far from an evil choice.    Obama has stated he disagrees with the constitution.  His policies directly conflict with our capitalist, democratic culture.  His friends, associates and members of his staff are evil as most people would define evil.  Rev. Wright is openly racist and that is evil.  Obama's book is clearly racist and that is evil.  His mentor Bill Ayers bombed the Pentagon, his daughter works for Hugo Chavez of Venezualia and he continues to make pro-terrorist, anti-American comments and that is evil.  I could go on and on though Obama clearly has evil anti-american views and is not qualified to be in office at any level.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	MCCAIN IN '08!  OBAMA NEEDS TO GO AWAY.|`|w6lONMCnaa	No one's perfect and, unfortunately, the best and brightest minds don't always run for president.  Therefore, you have to choose which issues are the most important to you and then vote for the person who agrees with you on those issues.  You will never agree 100% or perhaps even 70% with the person you choose, but if they support the issues that you feel are most important, and their past voting confirms that, then that's all that matters.    My top issues are ending the war in Iraq and women's rights.  Therefore, my candidate of choice is Barack Obama.  I'm sick of Washington the way it is, so a candidate with less Washington experience is appealing to me.  Barack doesn't waffle and change his views depending on how the wind blows.  Older people are also less willing to change their ways or listen to the other point of view.    Old crony Washingtonians are evil, newer Washingtonians are not evil - yet!|`|a6835ccabc3d1b44b1b3659af15ded48aa	I don't find either candidate evil.  While I might strongly disagree with the policies and campaigning tactics of one candidate, that doesn't mean I find either of them evil.      You herd this in the last election too.  People would say, "I'm voting for Bush because he's the lesser of two evils."  That always greatly irritated me and still does.      Neither man running for president is at all evil.  Just because you don't like their policies doesn't mean they are going to destroy America when they gain power.|`|AA11702773	Well, I guess I'd have to say the top two are Ron Paul and Chuck Baldwin.    Fortunately neither is evil, so I'd vote for Ron Paul as the best - in fact I intend to, since he is a registered write in candidate in California.    Nader, McKinney, Barr, and Jay have all endorsed Ron Paul's 4 unity points platform, as well.|`|AA10389562	You might as well be asking which brother would be better taking over the "family" business, Sonny or Michael Corleone.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	Ralph Nader|`|AA10436766	McCain.|`|naMQOSv7aa	McCain!|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	McCain|`|oKlD65njaa	I think Obama is a fine choice for president!|`|NiUyKGZSaa	I believe Obama when he says this......  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sj91NH5f...

However, the smaller parties like the Libertarian and Green won't get their share of that percentage, so it would be much larger.  But logically, he has the same chance of Obama.  Now will he make it over Obama?  That's up to the voters of this nation on Election Day 2008, not these lousy online polls that people assume a lot from.|`|ZvcjUVsXaa	Slim to none.

There are no democrats  only Republicans in denial|`|AA12358300	Yes, I bet you said that because of the poll numbers (many people believe in that)., but let's analyze.    Republican and Democrats basically get  45% and 45% of their own vote.    The poll may show the poeple who never voted before because they didn't feel interested or motiviated. Black race is a very significant one  However, most blacks are democrats, so the poll numbers does not help that much.    There may be about 2% of independents (including blacks) voting for Obama    so it will be 45 to 47 % to be exact.    McCain however, may lose the 2 % because and may gain some women independent voters.    which makes up 46 to 47%    The race is still tight! the numbers you see online may only be big lump sum of black people who are already obama supporters to begin with and polled again shows him more number, that is all|`|phjQGyDYaa	Considering the nation's IQ is at an all time low, Obama's chances are very good.

You may wish to make yourself greater than Bill or Hillary by posting this here, but with me, your effort fails.|`|qy88kFplaa	I think, once behind the voting curtain, both Bill and Hillary will vote for McCain. They have seen him in action in congress and it is obvious they both respect him. I also believe they are a bit concerned with Obama's lack of experience on foreign affairs, as well as domestic affairs and they realize that, now with more and more coming out about Obama's associations and comments he's made that sound like they came right out of the Marxist playbook, that Obama being nominated was a big mistake for our country.

Congress has already been holding hearing on how to take control of 401k's and universal health coverage which will have to be mandatory.  IF the nation can survive and Obama presidency, it will take many years to recover, but that's a big IF.

"Spread the wealth" of my hard earned income to those who don't want to help themselves.  Terrorism - his ties here and abroad  He will not present an authentic birth certificate.  Research that I have done proves that he was born in Kenya.  Father is Muslim  His friend Ayers, is an anarchist....very radical.  His economical plan will sink us further in the whole.  He wants to propose getting rid of 401K's and putting OUR money into a "government account" so that he can once again, spread the wealth  His and Ayers "idea" on reforming our public schools  He will not ban late term abortions..he voted 4 times to oppose it.  Will not admit that the surge worked and IS working.  Voted present almost everytime in Washington.  He does not want you to see the truth about him...if he wins, watch out.  His agenda will come out and smack us in the face.  He IS NOT QUALIFIED.  This will be an "on the job training for him"  In the primaries, Biden and Hillary both said that he was not qualified.  Biden said last week that if obama wins, we will definitely face a world wide crisis.  Yesterday, 10/27/08 Biden said that anyone making less that $150,000 a year won't be affected by the tax increase.  Obama said to the public tht it would be $250,000.  So this will affect many more Americans.  This is just scratching the surface of Obama's agenda and hatred towards America.  Don't trust him and he is lying through his teeth.    
DSSio06daa	I am praying...he hasn't had the advantage of having the press deep throating him like "that one" has so it is very difficult to know exactly what is happening...anyway, if Obama wins, my husband and I are leaving this country, we love it too much to watch him destroy it.

HE THINKS HE ALREADY WON AND HAS IT IN THE BAG!    Come on America!  Wake up!  He's spending a LOAD of money on this campaign then having his insincere pity on those that don't make more than however much money he's decided you need to make to be considered "wealthy".  (That amount changes on a daily basis.)    Plus, he wants voters that need to PAY THEIR BILLS to take off a day of work on election day.  Is he really that stupid?    I think it'll be hilarious if John McCain ends up winning this election by a very narrow margin.  Make Obama think he totally has it until.... uh-oh McCain pulls in the lead and stays there!    The republicans did not cheat.  The dems have had the last four years to prove their case beyond a shadow of a doubt that Gore won.  I see NO PROOF.

8KlYZCMGaa	McCain and Palin  The "change" that America needs!  We know where McCain and Palin stand on issues, economy, special needs kids, security, and to remain a free and capitalist country.  They both have more experience than obama...McCain has a proven track record, and Palin has a lot more experience than the man running for the presidency!!  Obama has voted "present" on most issues, was late to many senate meetings, and has only about 143 days of experience  Speaking of "special needs" children did you hear about the baby that was aborted at Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn Illinois?  In case you haven't I will give you tell you.  This 5 or 6 month fetus was aborted and left to die alone in a closet. A nurse caught wind of this and located this beautiful baby boy.  He happened to have Down's Syndrome.  The nurse did not want this boy to die alone.  She held him in her arms for 45 minutes until he died.  The nurse persued this and found that it was legal.  Obama voted not once, but 4 times to not ban late term abortions.  No matter how people try to twist abortion...it is murder.  The mother had a choice, but the poor helpless babies don't have the opportunity to a choice.  I don't have a special needs child but I totally support your campaign.|`|c6848eb483a5f1ebce26d98a8f25be32aa	Quit thinking only about yourself, think about our country. |`|onXtidBPaa	That's right, vote for the woman who cut spending on Alaska's special olympics.

I8KTji4daa	I just saw an ad next to you question "Yes On 8". I have no problem with gays marrying gays. If you ask me as a whole, the government should butt out on marriage. And leave it to the church to decide that. I am really pissed off in the lies that hear about prop 8 of protecting children and having to teaching it in schools. A bunch of lies, they have never taught me marriage in schools less about gays. Parents always have the power to take their children from programs that they don't see fit for them to be taught. I would have to bring them forms to be filled out if they would like me to be in a class that was being taught Sex.                  Personally I would like them to get married and see the reason why these straight shmucks get divorced. I would like it if they take my right from being married so I can tell every women "I wish I could marry you but I can't". I would love that so much.    Plus another thing I want to add. I don't see how these religious nuts think. Gay marriage, wrong. Alter boys and priests, okay.|`|3H8jvC2aaa	I'm straight and married and I think that religion has no place in government.  These people want to ban gay marriage because of religious beliefs.  Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  The US was started to escape religious persecution.  That is exactly what prop 8 is.  Some people believe they have the right to live their lives and love who they want without being subjected to other people's religious views.  Others think they have the right to dictate what is right for other people.    And on the subject of the sanctity of marriage, I want people to get their facts straight.  If you look back on the history of marriage, it was more about money and acquiring power than a holy thing.  Even to this day, a lot of cultures still marry their daughters off for financial gain.  Also, where is all the righteous indignation over the religious sects that exploit marriage as a ruse to sleep with and impregnate young girls?  The whole fervor over gay marriage between two consenting adults goes on while knowing that there are kids being exploited out in the open, gives me pause.  Why are people so set on persecuting one group of people, while another is going against everything I learned about religion and doing it tax free?  I would see that as a more urgent cause.  What is the true motive behind this movement?  Could it be political?  I think the subject of gay marriage is being used to sway voters away for what is really ailing our country.  The mob mentality keep people from seeing what is really going on.  The whole fear and distract tactic has been working so well that our country is about to fall and nobody is the wiser.  Really, what are we going to do when the debt comes due to China?  We owe them trillions.    The whole reason gay people want to get married in the first place is because a couple can be together for 20 years and then if one of them gets sick, the other has no rights to care for that person.  It is sad that some people feel they should play God with other people's lives.|`|4c7xJ7oXaa	I think it's funny that Californians think the rest of us know what Prop 8 is in the first place.  In Florida it's Prop 2.  Then again most Californians  think the world revolves around them.|`|4nKUehoRaa	whats there to protect?  Just look at Brittney Spear's 55 hour marraige.  I keep hearing the whole pure, sacred, under god's eyes bs but yet two gay people who love each other can't get married but two straight people who hate each other can.  |`|3ffb3b89c4d7e5f341def84b65cd6d10aa	i totally agree...also i have been all about equality for as long as I can remember..|`|kVnJp86Qaa	What it actually means is protecting the rights as a married couple of that being a man and woman.
4AVTIG4Gaa	Unfortunately without catching her at it or any proof there is nothing you can do. As she will just say she didn't do it. You need to put your belongings in a safer place in future but if there isn't anywhere suitable then you and your colleagues need to address this with your managers that you need lockers with keys. If your manager believed you then im sure she is keeping a close eye on this girl now, all you can do is try and catch her at it again and then call the police.|`|Iu9VmTuDaa	kuud just kick her a55 until she givez u the money back.|`|8pwbgw2faa	SUE her!!!to the court!!!  let her suffer!!!in the roting jail!!|`|de292ad47a31aedcb683cf279d2cb997aa	Tell the Police!

But yeah, seriously, go to the police. Most of the stores in Bluewater have cctv - does yours? if they have it on tape, ask your manager for a copy.    Does the girl come from a school around there? If she does, call the careers adviser, who probably organised it, and tell them about it.    Do you know for sure that she stole it? How do you know? Did you see her? Go to the police, but only if you are 100% sure she took it.    Kent police, in my experience, are usually rather good with this sort of thing, but they really will want more than a hunch that she took it. But go talk to them, and call up the headmaster/careers teacher at the school or college she came from, (if indeed she came from one) and tell them about it too.|`|pemGyfnwaa	How do you know it was her?

Geez, citizens who have or have had illegal immigrants in their families (or maybe even were illegal themselves, like Gov. Schwarzenegger) will now have a reason to identify with Obama, where before this was a Reagan-Republican amnesty type issue.    To PalmBayShane: Obama's mother was a natural-born US citizen, so any children she produced, wherever she had them in the world, are also considered to be natural-born US citizens. Otherwise, zillions of Army brats and ex-pat kids would be applying for citizenship.    So whether Obama was actually delivered in Hawaii or Kenya is a moot point; if his mom says she was in Hawaii, who are you and I to dispute it, especially since it doesn't matter?

But they know that some of the undecided voters will grasp at any lame reason to not vote for a black guy, a liberal, a guy who's allegedly soft on immigration and will help give their jobs away to furriners -- you get the idea.

R2MsEyDOaa	You are one brave gal putting a question like this up to Americans.  Socialism is viewed negatively in the U.S. because they do not understand what Democratic Socialism is and do not take the time to find out as is evidenced in the some of the early responses you are getting. BYW I looked 'socialism' up in several dictionaries and never saw the word 'communism' anywhere in the definition. I guess because they are not synonyms.    I wish you luck though I think you are going to get a lot of knee jerk reactions and no or very few logical answers.|`|aa376eb750675ff77dcfb63ac715c201aa	The United State is a DEMOCRACY.  The voice of the majority people who are citizens of this country choose the direction it will go in. Each and every citizen has the right to an education, a career, and power to decide how they earn and spend their money.   A socialist government would dictate how earning and wealth are distributed among all the citizens of the country.  Thus, there is no free economy.  Americans would never by into such a system.  |`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Because of the basic reasons and ways our country is set up are not that. Also, I'm not sure that it has ever really worked on a large scale for the average man|`|Y1mhs7ZLaa	Plain and simple, it's not fair.  People work hard for their money and shouldn't have to give it to the lazy.|`|AA11297448	Because in the history of man, it never worked. How many true socialist countries are there left? Socialism does not feed a successful country. |`|zlHgIltOaa	Public health care and college is working in Europe, that's for sure.    But socialism doens't ever truly work. It's a bit too idealistic.|`|AA11518835	Because socialism is not a meritocracy.   With socialism, money is taken from people who earn it and given to people who don't.   Some people argue that socialism is moral, but most people in America see people reaping what they sow as moral. Fairness means that everybody gets what they deserve, not everyone gets what the upper class earns.    For the evolution of any group, species, or system, the strong are advanced through strength, wether it is economic, military, technology, or any other type of power.  If you eliminate the incentive to achieve by allowing the lowest class to continue to live without giving any contribution, then you are decreasing the value of the whole, and only encouraging people to live only through the work of others.   For anyone who has studied evolution, as Darwin defines it, knows that this must be highly injurious to the race of man.  If the weakest members of a society were told that they must earn their keep if they want to stay alive, then they would either find the strength necessary to live, or they would die. Either way, the value of the society goes up.    Some experts say that in 2050, there could be 20 billion people on Earth. As the population of the human race grows, there can only be one outcome, and that is survival of the fittest. There are only a certain number of resources on the planet, and therefore only a certain number of people that can be sustained. One day that number will be reached. Socialism will ensure that we get to that day very, very quickly, and also that when we do get there the value of the society is greatly diminished.|`|rSHDuSsLaa	Because it's the antithesis of freedom and responstiblity. In exchange for governemt serving you, you sacrifice your freedom.    It's sort of like a gang or prison protection racket, and the goverment becomes your master, instead of the government being the servant of the people, according to how our nation was set up.    Socialism always tempts and seduces the weakest and most unpatriotic people, and this is what Barack Hussein Obama is all about, with his Wealth Redistribution agenda, invented by Commuinst co-founder, Karl Marx.    What some people instantaneoulsy recognize as a corrupt program, others somehow believe it will work to their advantage, because they're in the frame of mind of wanting government to do something for them, and give them something.    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...

The messed up thing is, those trailer trash morons who scream about socialism, but haven't a clue as to what real socialism is, are the ones who use these programs most. Plus, taxes pay for things like roads, schools, police and fire, military, parks, hospitals... things we need. It's just that the top 5% don't wanna pay their fair share. Pity.|`|0ccd9e73316b830fdf1a76ff2dcfd87aaa	Because socialism is exactly the opposite of what America and free market stands for. In short, the free market in America allows private individuals to make, and keep, as much money as they are willing to work for. You work hard, you make more money. In socialism, like what Obama is proposing, no matter how hard you work, the government takes your money from you and gives you back the exact same amount as everyone else. So....you work really hard at your upper level management job and you always get, lets say, 300$ a week. Well thats not fair b/c now your neighbor Bob slacked off all week at his McDonalds job and he's getting the same paycheck as you.     Oh and universal health care? My g/f is a nurse and she sums it up best. Under universal health, the best doctor in the country makes EXACTLY what the worst doctor makes. So whats his motivation for doing his best? He can slack off all day killing people and make exactly the same amount as everyone else. So basically, and unfortunately, money=motivation. So no money, no motivation! Vote McCain|`|vbAu5SY3aa	I think it has to do with people believing that those who are poor deserve to be poor. It is kind of like the story of the ant and the grasshopper where the ant works all day through the summer storing what they need for the winter, but the grasshopper plays around. Then when winter comes the grasshopper must ask for the help of the ant in order to survive. This puts a double burden on the ant and no burden on the grasshopper.    The problem with this story is that many poor ARE the ant. They gather food all summer, but not for themselves. They gather food for the rich grasshoppers who dole out small portions back and keep the ant working hand to mouth all their lives. Or the rich grasshoppers get ants in China to gather food or bring in ants from Mexico. They keep the American ants out in the cold because American ants ask for more portions and have the right to gather as groups to force the grasshoppers to pay an equitable share.   |`|e5NLDxNZaa	you are correct in your assertion that people in the usa generally view anything smacking of socialism in a negative light. i'm thinking that a lot of the negativity comes from a basic distrust of government that seems inherent in u.s. americans. we look at current government programs and find them rife with waste and mismanagement.  we have found it difficult to hold government accountable to our wishes and complaints.  so i think some of the prejudice to social programs springs from our belief that federal government will create another boondoggle --spending money foolishly, subject to corruption,layers of wasteful bureaucracy, and providing inferior service.  and i think some of our negative stereotype against social programs is from beliefs that undeserving individuals will benefit.  who we designate as undeserving varies greatly according to the myriad and diverse value systems among us americans.  some may think that poor people using the benefits of a social program provided by taxpayers are undeserving because they are lazy and unwilling to work to provide their own benefit.  some may think the social program provides benefits on too broad a scale ...that someone may use the program designed to benefit poor people fraudulently or unnecessarily to augment their lifestyle unfairly.   i think it remains a core belief of most usa americans that anyone in the usa is able to be totally self-sufficient if they'd just get off their butts and work.  i think the historical opportunity for healthy white americans to achieve has blinded the broader american public to the problems of lack of opportunity..and inability because of prejudice or handicap ..for some americans to achieve as well. as the country ages and matures, and i mean this both in terms of governance and of individuals, i think we are becoming more accepting of the idea that the government needs to provide for universal benefits for its citizens to improve the lives of the population as a whole.|`|5M6JmKr4aa	Because americans have been taught from birth to hate communism/socialism what they don't realize is there closest ally Britain is a socialist country and that is one of the richest countries in the world even though its tiny.

It has become a widley accepted way of thinking that every american has the right to supreme wealth, with no work ethic. Yes it is your right to pursue your goal of wealth if that is what you desire, but nowhere in that right does it say that the govt. is supposed to help you. The question is will America stop relying on the Govt. and start relying on themselves? The more we allow Govt. to intervene the more we lose our democracy.

Reagan for those who weren't around during his presidency, made it fashionable to step on those less fortunate than you.    During the 1980s after Reagan led the assault on union busting and corporate takeovers with his deregulation policy, people started getting greedy and taking money at all costs.     They didn't care if that meant putting good hard working Americans out of a job as long as it made them millionaires. We had guys like Ivan Boesky a notorious Wall Street insider trader who was caught in a scandal. Boesky in the 1980s had amassed a wealth estimated to have been around $200 million dollars mostly by cheating/stealing by betting on corporate takeovers. He did so because he had first hand knowledge (tips from corporate insiders) of what was going to happen hence "insider trading" and that allowed him to accumulate his wealth.    He would buy massive amounts of stock in some cases days before a corporation announced a takeover hence (insider trading) !    Michael Milken was another spawned during the Reagan years. He was the creative mind behind "junk bonds" or high yield bonds. After being convicted and sent to prison on finance related charges, Milken was referred to as the epitome of 1980s Wall Street greed. A trend that continues to this day and we just seen it repeated with the housing industry and the $700B bail out. Milken was convicted on racketeering and securities fraud charges  after having 98 indictments brought against him.    In the Michael Douglas movie titled "Wall Street" whch was loosely based on the Wall Street greed of the 1980s, Douglas' character, Gordon Gekko is quoted in the movie with the line that summed up 1980s greed by saying: "Greed is good" ! That line is said to have been spoken by Boesky during a speech !|`|AA12358300	No,     but I noticed Obama tends to lean the left with his head when he speaks.

You sound like a 12 year old boy "My army is stronger than your army!"    Fact is, from World War II up until the mission in Afghanistan, Canada's military strategy was that of a peacekeeping role. Meaning we worked in cooperation with other UN nations as a third party in keeping conflict down in unstable regions. Unlike the U.S. army who has a reputation of imperialism, we did not invade other countries, like I don't know, Vietnam, Korea, Kuwait, and Iraq.     I do not feel at all bad about the size of our military, as our nations resources have gone to much better uses such as universal health care and affordable university and college education.

However, if there was a battle between a squad of Canadian troops and a squad of American troops, the Canadians would win.  Even if you made the Yanks Green Berets, Marines, or Navy Seals.    As well, Canadians are not always neutral.  The PEOPLE may be neutral; most Canadians don't even think about the fact that we have troops in Afghanistan.  The government is forcibly allied with the USA due to our uncalled for continuation of NATO membership.

I will not challenge you statics even though you do not support them because the answer is the same whether they are true or not.   Obama is the elected leader of this country. Though politically we differ Americans come together under our new presidents. Not to say that there are not dissenters because we encourage it. We have solved the question as to is best fit to lead now we will work with him to solve our mutual problems.  Prop 8 on the other hand violated both the first and fourteenth amendments of the US Constitution. We Americans will not accept oppression. Because prop 8 defines marriage based on even the majority of religions it infringes on the rights of minority religions. Thus the law prohibits the free practice of religion. By even putting it on the ballot the state of California violated section 1 of the 14th amendment that forbids states from abridging rights granted under the US constitution.  40 years ago it was illegal in several Southern states for whites and blacks to marry. Now we have elected a president who is the product of such a union. One day we will elect a president raised in by same sex couples. |`|EkSQOPGzaa	Gracious? Are you kidding me?

There are passionate opinions on both sides. I have two friends who live in Cali and are gay. They are happy to have a civil union and all of the benefits that they claim are equal to marriage. Their opinion is that it is a radical wing of the homosexual community that is trying to force acceptance on the balance of the Cali population. This of course will never work. You can't shove something like this down peoples throats without expecting a back lash.    The general opinion is that the vote was really about overturning the courts reversal of a previous bill voted on and passed by the Cali folks.    I do agree that the McCain voters have be very gracious about accepting their loss, unfortunately there are a great number of Obama voters that are poor losers. I've seen some disgusting comments by Obama supporters with will just add to the division of our country.     I guess some folks never learn.

Quando  diventato PDS,non hanno fiatato,quando  diventato DS(e gi era scomparsa la falce e martello nel simbolo),non hanno fiatato e quando  diventato PD,hanno nuovamente bevuto dall'amaro calice,convinti che i valori  dei dirigenti fossero gli stessi di 30 anni fa.    Il PD non  il PCI.    E' l'unione dell'anima dossettiana della vecchia DC con le forze riformiste,ma come il partito  cambiato  cambiata anche la tempra morale,l'etica, lo spirito di quei dirigenti che oggi trafficano,inciuciano, smistano parenti in consigli d'amministrazioni,complottano al cellulare con gaglioffi e imprenditori ammanicati,tramano.    E' anche ammirevole il fatto che credano ancora a tutte le stronzte che propinano loro,ma questa loro "fede" indefessa fa solo il male del loro partito.Se non li puniscono con l'astensionismo quelli continueranno nelle solite miserevoli trame e intrighi da 4 soldi,giocando a fare "la classe dirigente",convinti ancora,poich votati,che esista ancora una base,che la loro verginit sia ancora intatta e i loro valori "migliori".

QqxrVVnlaa	There are also plenty of us on here who aren't paranoid about Islam in the UK. Interesting that you feel that most UK contributors are fearful of Islam. Perhaps you're right.    Yeah, the Americanisation of the UK. You can walk down any high street or city centre in the UK and see exactly the same shops. McDonald's, Starbucks, KFC, etc. Mostly US based multinationals.     But it's a symptom of a wider issue and that is that small, independent shops simply cannot compete with the mass production of the bigger stores.    High street butchers, vegetable and general grocery stores have been disappearing at an incredible rate and this has massively changed the culture in the UK.    Interesting point. I hope some of the racists and bigots get to read this Q, and maybe pause to think about it for a while.    Alter Ego, please read my 3rd paragraph again!  You felt you had to explain to me why high street shops couldn't compete with supermarkets. You said pretty much what I did. Anyway, are you anything to do with Mr. Septics sister? She's blocked me. Perhaps you could have a word.    hahaha, I don't think he gets it J!|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Yeah, it would be fair to say that - that hadn't really occured to me.|`|8Kmp90JDaa	I think some British people dislike Muslims because their culture is so different from British culture and they dislike the fact that they do not assimilate into British culture. A lot of immigrants to the UK, regardless of what country they come from, are also often disliked because some people think that they are taking jobs and / or living off of the welfare system. That's not always true, but it often is. My relatives in the UK are very vocal about their dissent for the large influx of immigrants into the country. There's also SOME people in the UK, not a lot, but some, who are racist and hate any non white immigrants. The British National Party (BNP) thrives on the hate of non white immigrants. Fortunately most people in the UK realize that the BNP is a racist and wrong. I personally don't understand why some people, in any country, are against immigrants, because immigrants help improve countries. People should embrace diversity and different cultures.    Americanization ruining British culture? I'm an American who has relatives in the UK, and my observations are that most people in the UK have no issue with American culture (movies, songs, technology, etc) just as most Americans have no problem with British culture in the US (BBC America, BP oil, British TV shows, etc). The US and UK have always shared a similar culture. I think that it's possible that some new immigrants to the UK dislike the fact that the UK has similar cultural aspects to the US, and if they dislike that, then they shouldn't have moved to the UK.|`|VfYvJypEaa	Yes we hate Americanism . The destruction of our language and the general dumbing down of humanity . However Islam is an evil , barbaric , medieval religion and it's brain washed follows are little more than animals . It is a far bigger threat .   As for Americanism , remember we invented you in the first place .|`|61YfPllfaa	America has always been our ally. our friend. its a back and forth thing. for instance during the 1960s British culture totally dominated America. we have always openly shared our music, our arts ETC. our cultures have always been comfortably intertwined. + you have to remember that the American people in both world wars stood by our side. they are proven friends.  Islam has brought an ugliness to Britain,  its a religion, a cult...call it what you will, that just goes against every thing Britain stands for. it has proved to be hate fuelled and oppressive. it doesn't share, mix, become part of.....it dominates. looks for submission. it shows no respect and offers nothing but the same hot headed violence that it supposedly ran from in the first place. British people look at all other Islamic dominated country's. they are all a violent hate fuelled oppressive shambles. a smouldering ugly blood drenched mess. now we are seeing it raising its head here, we simply don't want it. we don't want our children dodging Islamic bullets on their way to school. risking bombs every time they go into town shopping. Islam doesn't belong here. our cultures clash completely. its time we all woke up to that fact.|`|AA11052660	I don't think that the British people fear the peaceful aspects of Islam.  I think they fear fundamentalism, the violent aspects, and the anti-western sentiments that appears to be prevalent amongst some fanatical muslims.|`|a2lYcWcmaa	Americanisation is seen as a plus by British youth due to the current mass entertainment industry following American examples. Not enough homegrown talent and people start to look elsewhere for it.

Theres also the stories of councils cancelling Christmas to avoid offending people which the media exaggerates and distorts.  This offends a lot of poeplo.    A lot of people also hate the anti-women, anti-free speech (cannot criticise mohammed?) sentiment expressed by some muslims as this is foreign to a great many British people..|`|AA11900069	I think I need to go sit down, put my head between my knees, and breathe deeply...   It seems there is an AMERICAN, who actually carries the EMPATHY gene!  You CAN see things from the perspective of those far away in foreign lands, who aren't exaclty delighted with US troops and tanks outside their front-doors!       I really didn't think I would see the day.  Hallelujah!  Hi-Five?         I know exactly what you mean about the spread of MuckDonalds and Booger-King too.  It kills me when I see and hear examples of incredible ingnorance of what is going on around us, coming from the youth...  Though I did see a while back, that there was a tablet found and translated from an ancient Greek temple - it was the voice of a Grumpy Middle-Aged Man decrying the fact that "...the youth of today know nothing, their culture is being ruined by imported ideas, they don't know what is going on in the world but they think they know it all..." (continues in this vein for a long time) - so perhaps this despair is just something that comes to us all, at a certain age?  ("Youth.  It is wasted on the young")?        Personally, I was raised colour-blind.  I see Humans, and I see them everywhere.  Some are good, some bad, but I honestly try to meet them all with the same openess I would like them to show me, and in being civil to them, I give them a chance to be civil back to me.  The third time they are blunt, dismissive, strident, or (my favourite American phrase) "a little off", I give up on them, until they prove otherwise.           This question - clearly-stated, well-illustrated and lucid, fills me with hope.  Too often, I see American responses are just "death to terrorism!  WE will kill them all!" and so on.   Are you sure you aren't an ex-pat Brit?|`|PRbtcAHOaa	'British culture' was murdered by the skinheads  it no longer exists  there were times when full integration was common, people understood their differences, maybe even mocked each other because of them ,but got on. islam wasn't feared, after all the british had managed to colonize huge swathes of what had previously been muslim land, they were just seen as peculiars, much like gays are seen by some.    then the skinheads decided they wanted jobs, and realized that the predominantly muslim asians from middle eastern countries had, through hard work, managed to get them.  it would have taken years, maybe even decades of saving to be able to afford to move to and live in england.    so the asians were beaten, because of their beliefs, because of their colour, because the british thought that they were being robbed; of culture, of jobs, of whatever.    so, they fought back  isolated themselves in compact, close knit communities within larger white ones, safety in numbers was the key.    any friendships that had been forged were strained, some of the british still saw themselves as superior after years of dominance, and the government over-compensated for the skinhead's actions by awarding the asians and muslims liberties and carrying out their every request in order not to seem racist.  all this did was to enrage the brits further    suddenly, things had changed, and the old british culture was being 'toned down' by the government so as to welcome in the new working asian muslim class.      british people didn't really recognize Americanization until it was widespread, it seemed normal, it was western, and it slotted in pretty well with the british way of life  islam, however, was from an alien land with alien practices and odd customs, it stood out, and it was never going to be accepted.|`|s0PMYVK2aa	The yanks have been here since ww1 making you some 50+ years late with that question,|`|da0cac4019af78f152d4629de9df86baaa	the "british culture"what ever that is suposed to exactly mean, is a culture made by british people, whom are not all white. its made by islamic culture, indian culture, irish culture, scotish culture (u get the drift?) but if you call it "english"culture then it would narrow it down to the tiny forgotten villages lol.

Scottish culture and identity is strong.Go to an old firm game n you'll see what I mean,ha,ha !!!     It's not the demise of our culture that breeds suspicion of Islam but fundamentalism.Since the days of Puritism and religious wars of the 17th and 18th century intense religion has been something this  country has shyed away from.    And no bad thing whatsoever !!!!    We are wary of Islam because we don't understand the kind of religion or the intensity of it that would make someone happily blow themselves up in the name of their religion.    In this country we believe in freedom of thought,speech etc.Individual freedom is something that is fundemental to Britian and that is something strong religion doesn't marry with.    I don't believe that American culture is taking over our country either,we have a mass of quality music,film and media to be proud of that also travels across the Atlantic.    I think Americans overplay their influence in the world !!!!|`|448124cb95020e8ac9f513fcaefd4c93aa	There are now 2 million Muslims out of a total of 60 million population in UK and most Muslims I also acknowledge are not terrorists. We ourselves are to blame for loss of culture and sense of National pride that used to exist but to a certain extent other people take advantage of our weakness.    However, we do not see many Americans who live here strapping on a bomb and blowing up innocent people who are also British by the way.    I understand that parts of London for instance are not becoming more Americanised looking so much as a Muslim enclave. Perhaps there needs to be more integration on both sides.    I understand that one of the underground bombers had a broad Yorkshire accent this does not make sense to me if they lived here I'm afraid.    Edit:  you come across as very opinionated but actually quite close minded and ignorant about what is actually going on in the world.    'we are bombing their lands'   we who is we?    are you referring to people who are shooting at our soldiers in Afghanastan or the people who blow themselves up and kill soldiers in Iraq.    Edit:    'they are shooting at us because they want us out of their lands.'  I see you have changed your story and the excuse again to suit the wrong argument that you are proposing.  Check-it out these invasions as you call them took place after 9/11 and London tube explosions.  As an appologizer for terrorists do you not appreciate that although these countries were invaded the regime they replaced were far worse than the occuping troops ever are. Some countries now have free voting and beginning to look after their own affairs.|`|WJjkq7lTaa	Americanisation, as you phrase it, is not worried about because it is seen as a complementary, in many cases advantageous influence to British culture, only occassionally is it seen as corrosive (guns'n'fatties). This is hardly surprising, both nation's culture growing from a common root.      However I would refute that American cultural influences are predominant in the British urban environment - the high street is still dominated by domestic vendors, while music, fashion & the arts when they occasionally rely on external influence find that no less from Europe. Music & film less so (the language barrier) but as America is a large producer of such products it is scarcely surprising Britain consumes some, though this has not compromised the unique, if more limited, character of UK products. Certainly trans-atlantic influence in these fields is far from one-way.  Also, UK urbanism, away from metropolitan centres is normally very unamerican.    Islam is a very different influence - centralist, moralising, authoritarian & quite at odds with the freedom & coarse individualism of Anglo-Saxon culture, which most of us (& you) quite enjoy living with. Clearly adopting it in any meaningful way would require us to actively set aside defining & well loved elements of our culture.     But hey, less than 5% of the country are Muslim, so lets not be too concerned...|`|0IMjFvbdaa	first of all not all of us are terrified of islam, personally i despise it because i dislike organised, dogmatic religion generally.    our cities have not been taken over by americanisation as you put it. there are plenty of element of US culture that have crossed the atlantic, and definitely a lot of companies from america are strong over here. i fail to see how that makes american culture a threat british culture. the two share common roots and are ditinctly compatible with one another.   plenty of british movies/actors do well in america, british music is and had been for a long time hugely successful in america, the british invented the computer/TV/plenty of other technology, british companies are the biggest investors in the USA in the world, just as US companies are the biggest investors in britain, it works both ways.    the reason people despise islam is because the media portrays it as a massive threat to our way of life, whether it is or not is not the point here. we like plenty of aspects of americanism, its not a problem really. personally i dislike the rabid consumerism that is often considered to go hand in hand with american culture, but im not convinced thats not just anglo-saxon capitalism.|`|aVJyU3Tjaa	I think this is a very touchy subject, and nothing good can come of discussing it.    You come across as a bit aggressive and close-minded, which meant that I didn't read your argument properly, I'm not sure what you're trying to argue in fact.    I can say for sure that I don't hate any entire race. I hate it when people say 'I hate Americans' or 'I hate Russians' or 'I hate all Asians'. At least visit these countries before you make such a judgement.    And, those who are commenting on Iraqis and Afghans shooting our troops, I think you'll find in these conflicts (Iraq arguably being an illegal invasion) a lot more Iraqi and Afghan civilians have been killed than our troops.     And I also think that the Gaza-Israel-Palestine crisis is a bit more deserving of our attention at the moment.

Thousands of Egyptians travels to the UK and all around the world on holiday, for business and for studies every year.

7mURkfjSaa	Effectivement, Bayrou est tout mou, et le fait qu'il se plaigne tout le temps, est fatiguant. Il n'est pas de taille (enfin j'me comprends ...) face  NS et sa dtermination.  Pour parler de Sgo, c'est trs vite fait, c'est zro: zro programme, zro sincrit, et zro comptence.  L'arme qui peut faire chouer NS c'est effectivement si Chirac se prsente, et il en est encore capable, le vieux Lion.

LULA de novo com a for?a do povo.    ONU coloca Brasil pela 1a vez em grupo de alto desenvolvimento humano no mundo       O Brasil entrou pela primeira vez no grupo dos pases de alto desenvolvimento humano, de acordo com o ndice de Desenvolvimento Humano (IDH) da Organiza??o das Na??es Unidas (ONU), informou um relatrio divulgado nesta ter?a-feira    "Ao ingressar no grupo de pases de alto desenvolvimento humano, o Brasil marca o incio, mesmo que simblico, de uma nova trajetria e de um novo conjunto de aspira??es", disse o Programa das Na??es Unidas para o Desenvolvimento (Pnud) em comunicado no seu site oficial no Brasil.    "O olhar deve voltar-se ao desempenho do conjunto de pases latino-americanos que tm um desenvolvimento humano superior ao brasileiro, incluindo Argentina, Chile, Uruguai, Costa Rica, Cuba e Mxico. O Brasil possui indicadores de desenvolvimento humano inferiores em quase todas as dimens?es."    O ndice de Desenvolvimento Humano brasileiro aumentou em rela??o ao ano passado de 0,792 para 0,800, sem levar em considera??o as revis?es de dados, informou a ONU. No ranking absoluto de 177 na??es, entretanto, o pas caiu uma posi??o.    O IDH, calculado anualmente pelo Pnud, faz parte do Relatrio de Desenvolvimento Humano 2007/2008, apresentado nesta ter?a-feira em Braslia, com a presen?a do Presidente Lula.    O Brasil foi beneficiado no ndice por atualiza??es feitas para a expectativa de vida em 62 pases. A expectativa de vida no Brasil aumentou de 70,8 anos para 71,7, informou o Pnud.    "No caso do Brasil pode-se afirmar que a evolu??o dos indicadores de desenvolvimento humano mostra uma alta consistncia entre 1990 a 2005. Durante este perodo, a expectativa de vida cresceu mais que cinco anos e meio, o PIB per capita cresceu por volta de um sexto e as taxas de alfabetiza??o dos adultos cresceu quase sete pontos percentuais", acrescentou o comunicado.

AA11474133	To the statement that Obama is just about issues:  I get tired of all the democrats just saying McCain is a clone of Bush, 4 more years of the same, etc.  That is hardly the case.  McCain will actually cut spending.    For the question above, I'm scared to death that we will get this left-wing extremist for a president.  I don't for a minute believe he will really cut my taxes.|`|athSKc9uaa	McCain's problem is that he and Palin both seem to think that campaigning means killing the competition so you're the only choice left.     Obama has done exceptionally well in ignoring all of what McCain and Palin throw at him and instead focusing on the issues. I think when Obama said that McCain and Palin seem more intent on bringing the Democrats down than on lifting the country up he got the two of them where it hurts.     McCain is depending on his "record", his "strategy", and his "veterans" to vouch for him, which they probably will - but that's only SO MUCH of the population. His proposals don't  provide any solutions, and any one who's not blinded by his precious "war-record" will catch on to that.    McCain's not going out there to prove he's the best candidate - he's going out to prove that everyone else is NOT. And in doing so, he's forgetting to show the public what makes HIM the better choice.    That just makes him look out of focus, insecure and, as Obama quite adequately put it, "out of ideas."

Mais le taux lev de suicides en France dmontre qu'il n'est pas toujours possible d'intervenir  temps ou de porter une assistance suffisante  ces ames en dtresse.

Si quelqu'un t'a vu et porte plainte contre toi (par exemple quelqu'un de sa famille qui tait un peu plus loin), alors tu es mal...    Tu risques 5 ans de prison et 500 000 francs d'amende (art.223.6 du Code Pnal), mme si le gars voulait se suicider.    Il existe mme un arrt du 28 novembre 1986 qui prcise que "la volont d'1 personne de mettre fin  ses jours par suicide ne dispense pas de l'obligation de porter secours, devoir d'humanit li  la protection de la vie d'autrui."    Si tu trouves cela injuste, pense que beaucoup de ceux qui font des tentatives de suicide ne veulent en ralit que mettre fin  leur malheur et non  leur vie ; c'est souvent un appel au secours.

Je suis un francais vivant au Gabon, l'expulsion des francais en situation irrgulire sont une rponse  l'expulsion de 2 gabonais vivant en France dans des conditions indignes (un des 2 gabonais a du laisser sa fille de 4 ans en France). De plus lors de ces 2 expulsions l'tat francais a viol la loi sur les flux migratoires entre ces deux pays sign en 2002 puis en 2007 lors de la venue de Sarkozy au Gabon. Pour mettre encore plus de l'huile sur le feu France 2 relay par France 3 et TV5 ont montr un reportage sur les biens du prsident Omar Bongo Ondimba. Nous sommes 10 000 francais au Gabon et saches que la majorit ne sont pas des nationaux comme tu le prtends. De plus saches que ces nationaux ont la double nationalit franco-gabonaise donc ils sont en toute rgularit sur les deux sols...  Donc quand on ne sait pas faudrait mieux fermer sa gueule, car avec les conneries de France 2 nous francais du Gabon on ne veut pas que ca finisse comme la C?te d'Ivoire...

The reflection on the days of difficulty and danger which are past, is rendered the more sweet, from a consciousness that they are succeeded by days of uncommon prosperity and security. If we have wisdom to make the best use of the advantages with which we are now favored, we cannot fail, under the just administration of a good Government, to become a great and a happy people.    The Citizens of the United States of America have a right to applaud themselves for having given to mankind examples of an enlarged and liberal policy: a policy worthy of imitation. All possess alike liberty of conscience and immunities of citizenship. It is now no more that toleration is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights. For happily the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection, should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.    It would be inconsistent with the frankness of my character not to avow that I am pleased with your favorable opinion of my administration, and fervent wishes for my felicity. May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants, while every one shall sit in safety under his own wine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid. May the father of all mercies scatter light and not darkness in our paths, and make us all in our several vocations useful here, and in his own due time and way everlastingly happy.

L'Afrique est le plus rcent rservoir en matires premires, et onc le plus riche et le plus prometteur. Et vu les nombreuses faiblesses de nos frres de couleur, notamment au niveau culturel, organisationnel et politique (les colonisateurs ont foutu le bordel chez eux, dtruisant toutes leurs coutumes, et ils sont compltement perdus dans le monde moderne), il est particulirement facile de les mener  la baguette sans fioritures dmocratiques. les renversements de pouvoir sont surtout le fait d'intervenants occidentaux.    Pourquoi croyez-vous que les Amricains et les Chinois font risette aux Africains ? C'est la plus belle proie actuelle pour l'imprialisme !    Si les Europens se dsengagent de l'Afrique, c'est un boulevard pour les USA (et en moindre mesure la Chine). Ceux-ci, capitalistes de la pire espce, vont mettre  sac leur continent, et il n'en restera que des miettes quand ils seront prts  assumer leur destin. Mais cela cadre parfaitement avec la politique atlantiste  laquelle se rallie de plus en plus l'Europe, dans les sillage des Anglais et des pays de l'Est.    Conclusion :  Si l'Europe a une quelconque ambition de devenir la premire puissance conomique mondiale - ce dont elle est largement capable-, elle DOIT s'engager rsolument en Afrique.    Personnellement, je crois qu'elle doit aussi user de ses liens historiques privilgis pour contrecarrer l'influence nfaste des autres puissance imprialistes ... tout en essayant d'tre le plus juste possible dans ses relations.

J li vrios casos onde a Justi?a, em todos os pases, n?o funcionou, falhou sua miss?o constitucional, porque foi administrada por pessoas que s?o concursadas e ali permanecem cometendo atos aticos - e n?o tem sindicancia q venha det-los.Vivemos um dilema entre atos  ticos e n?o ticos....

nACgAGc3aa	Concordo com vc na parte em diz sobre a globo:   Realmente, ela manipula resultados e noticias, e atras desta manipulacao ficamos sabendo apenas de uma lado das machetes, o lado doa neoliberais, tao direitista e elitistas como a globo e seus comparcas.  Eh triste ver como o fechamento desta TV aberta esta sendo noticiada no Brasil. Nenhum de nos, ou muito poucos de nos sabe do que houve na tentativa de golpe de estado na venezuela no ano de 2002. Todas as TV's bancadas com capital norteamericano tentaram depor o Hugo Chaves, e a RCTV foi uma delas. A tentativa foi tremenda, mas nao passou de tentativa. Chaves chegou a ser tirado do poder por tres dias, data suficiente para o povo conhecedor dos seus direitos irem ateh o palacio e impor a volta de seu presidente. Acredite, o povo gritava para a volta de Chaves e as TV diziam ter libertado o povo de ditador. Ditador ou nao, nao sei: mas adorado pelo povo. E assim, ate o exercito se voltou com os ricos petroliferos e a volta de Chaves foi inevitavel. Vc sabia disso?? Caso sim, Talvez nao desse jeito, pq nao foi noticiada assim aqui no Brasil pela Globo, sabe pq?? Porque a Globo e a maior forma de poder que ha no Brasil. Todo e qualquer presidente, qualquer constituicao, TUDO depende do alvara da globo. Caso contrario: ele depoem. Ta ai o Collor pra dizer.

Outros atos dele nada democrtico, mas este ele acertou em cheio, pois a RCTV infelizmente por conta do seu dono acabou participando ativamente do golpe de estado q tentaram aplicar no Chaves, usando inclusive RCTV p/ fazer anncios falsos, chegando ao ponto de editar uma foto de um blog, dizendo q eram carros do Hugo Chaves, est tudo em vdeo documentado no YouTube, e no meu blog tem uma matria q trato disto, com todos os links, vejam no meu Live Space, link no meu perfil.  Fazer oposi??o  uma coisa saudvel na democracia, mas participar ativamente do golpe de Estado  bem outra coisa, demorou p/ fechar a RCTV.  H uma outra tc particular q faz oposi??o ao Hugo Chaves, q teve sua concess?o renovada, mas a RCTV  outra estria.  Neste ponto Chaves tem raz?o quando afirmou q nosso congresso, repetiu como papagaio o discurso americano sobre o fechamento da RCTV, foi absolutamente preciso.  Nossos meios de comunica??o no Brasil, est?o vendendo errada a notcia sobre a RCTV, a verdade eles todos omitem, s fala em tapar a boca da imprensa, falta de democracia, e a coisa n?o  nada por ai, os motivos s?o bem outros, e n?o por conta da oposi??o da RCTV, mas por ter cometido crime grave contra a democracia daquele pas, a RCTV dan?ou exatamente por q era anti-democrtica.

Eat Mexican food, throw fiestas, smash pinatas, listen to latin music, etc....but if you want to live in America learn the language and come legally.

In their defense.... if you are raised that way and by those people, you are going to naturally think slavery was justified and you're also going to know the stories that have been handed down from your great grandparents. Many white southerners were forced to do their OWN work when slavery ended and everyone knows white folk and hot, manual labor don't mix :) There were no Mexicans to come along and do it on the cheap and you can imagine a bunch of them probably didn't know how to do it since the slaves had done it for so long. They may have lost their farms....who knows....whatever the case, some of the die-hard southerners feel that the south will rise again....|`|AA10382850	The North was more racist than the South. The North was the ones who ran the slave trade ships.  They had $$ signs in their eyes. Slavery has been dead for 150 years.  No one in their right mind would justify it.  Also, America was not the first, nor the last to have slavery - the world likes to pick on the top dog.  Whites, not Africans raising up to free their brothers and sisters, were the ones who fought to abolish slavery.  Jefferson Davis had an adopted black son.  The Union, however, snatched him and would not tell them what happened to him. He was named Jim Limber Davis. The North could not have that little tidbit of info get out.  It was not PC.  BTW, Kasey Kane, the Rebel flag does not represent slavery, nor does it mean that people accept slavery.  It was an evil practice. The flag represents the South, which the North virtually raped when they occupied the South for 12 years of "reconstruction."  It should have been named "destruction."|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	No.|`|312fee674ffb63e34af04971f8089f43aa	All slave owners  children were raise by a slave Mamma and  they had a great influence  on  the  white children they raised.|`|prw4PoVEaa	gt|`|AA12124355	Possibly, but I doube it is significant.|`|Kvl4oD2Faa	only the very rich north & south owned slaves...no faimly member of mine ever did|`|XmMnoNilaa	maybe. personally i give slavery very little thought. most would consider me a lib and my family owned slaves,but that is the past.|`|Qt2okCqEaa	You can find a few wrong minded people in every crowd.|`|674c6c802dbcd154a60bfef1dba0d8abaa	Dud, wasn't that like 150 years ago?

Trust me, it will work.|`|bgJMglpbaa	You do realize that slavery was nationwide right? it simply died out last in the south and not all that far behind the north. So my answer is no I do not.    Dr. Lyon G. Taylor, the scholarly President of William and Mary College, Virginia, and an authority, says, regarding this statement, "I am sure it can be said that no Southern man or Southern ship, as far as is known, engaged in the slave trade."    The fact that there was domestic traffic in slaves, some of this domestic traffic being carried on through coastwise trading, seems to have confused some and induced them to believe the South engaged in the slave importing business. On the other hand, the responsibility of New England and New York for the almost exclusive monopoly of domestic participation in the slave importing business is most clearly established. Massachusetts looms largely to the front when investigation into this gruesome subject is pursued. The first slave ship of this country, the Desire, was fitted out in Massachusetts, and set sail for the coast of Africa from Marblehead. Massachusetts was the first of all the colonies to authorize the establishment of slavery by statute law, doing this some decades before her example was followed by any of the Southern colonies. The first statute establishing slavery in America is embodied in the Code of the Massachusetts Colony in New England, adopted in 1641, and it should be realized that slave trading in Massachusetts was not a private enterprise but was carried on by authority of the Plymouth Rock colony.     There is much more...  http://southernslavery.com/articles/sout...|`|LHiiMDrNaa	Slavery is alive and well; it's just been disguised a bit.  Forty-one percent of the world's population live in abject poverty on less than $2 per day as they manufacture and produce the goods for capitalists.  This percentage doesn't include those who earn more than $2 per day in the developed nations but still live in poverty.      Capitalism requires tremendous amount of slavery and racism to make the system work.  If all workers throughout the world were paid a living wage, capitalism would collapse.     "You can't have capitalism without racism and you cannot have racism without capitalism."  -- Malcolm X

39331a1596fd5dfeb1503344ae355dedaa	Bon en fait cette question a dj t pose il y a environ 5 mois, je vais donc copier/coller la rponse Kathia B qui a rpondu clairement  cette question.  "Il est IMPOSSIBLE de quitter la Scurit Sociale.  L'adhsion est obligatoire. Vous avez un N de scu ds votre naissance ! On ne peut s'y soustraire. C'est une obligation lgale. La Scurit Sociale est un rgime obligatoire de cotisation, tout comme les retraites complmentaire Arrco et ventuellement Agirc (pour les cadres).    Ce que vous avez lu est une rumeur rpandue dans la presse. Je vous invite  relire le Prambule de la Constitution de 1946 qui pose le principe d'une scurit sociale fonde sur la solidarit.    Pour info, il n'existe aucune loi europenne imposant de mettre en concurrence les systmes de scurit sociale, car dans le droit communautaire exclut tout simplement  chaque fois la Scu de ces rgles. Il n'existe que des rgles de coordination de scurit sociale entre pays europens (?a consiste  faire en sorte que les droits des salaris soient maintenus et qu'on prenne en compte les priode travailles dans un pays de l'UE) Le droit communautaire n'a JAMAIS cr une quelconque loi imposant une concurrence des lgislations en matire de scurit sociale.  C'est une fausse rumeur propage par la presse.    Je vous invite  lire, d'ailleurs, cet arrt de la CJCE :  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sg...    C'est la raffirmation d'un arrt rendu dj en 1984. Il s'agissait de deux personnes qui ont refus de cotiser  la scu en invoquant le droit de cotiser  une assurance prive. La CJCE rappelle clairement que la concurrence ne concerne pas les scu et que chaque pays organise librement sa lgislation en matire de scu. Or, en France, il est obligatoire d'tre affili et de cotiser, sur le principe de solidarit nationale. Si tout le monde voulait faire comme vous et quitter la Scu, 1/ sympa, la solidarit nationale 2/ vous ne gagneriez pas plus : le patron ne vous reverserait absolument pas la part non cotise !!!    Enfin, si vous entendez parler d'une directive europenne imposant la mise en concurrence des assurances, elle existe effectivement, mais elle ne concerne que les mutuelles, les institutions de prvoyance et les socits d'assurance.    Communiqu du 27 octobre 2004 de la Commission Europenne : "Les Etats membres conservent l'entire ma?trise de leur systme de scu. Les informations rcemment parues dans la presse, selon lesquelles Bruxelles aurait mis fin au monopole de la Scurit sociale, sont donc errones"    http://www.securite-sociale.fr/comprendr...    Je vous rappelle enfin que l'employeur qui ne cotise pas  la scu (part salariale et/ou patronale) commet une infraction pnale. Toute personne qui incite  ne plus cotiser  la scu risque 6 mois d'emprisonnement et/ou 7500 d'amende.    En clair : la rumeur court depuis 2004 et confond plus ou moins volontairement la libralisation des assurances prives avec la Scurit sociale, deux choses qui n'ont rien  voir        * Il y a 4 mois    Sources :  Etudiante en 5me anne de droit du travail, aprs avis de l'URSSAF, d'une enseignante spcialiste du droit communautaire et d'un avocat spcialis en droit social (et donc Scurit sociale)    PS : Le fameux Reichmann est en procs... Il fait allusion  une ordonnance publie au JO qui abroge le monopole : jugez-vous mme : ?a parle des mutuelles..."      MERCI A KATHIA B|`|67Vyif7yaa	Merci  KD de mettre les choses au point.

AA11474133	You won't get a reference, because there isn't one.  The statement that the tax cuts were for the rich is just democratic misleading crap.    You can get the tax tables on the IRS web site.    I found 2001 rates on page 275 of http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p17--20...    2007 rates: http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,...    You can see from this there is nothing that gives a lower rate for higher income.  The percentage of cut is most for the lowest income (15% to 10% is a third less).  The top bracket went from 39.6 to 35%.  Not a big deal.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Provided you are intelligent enough to digest this information, this should answer your questions:    http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedP...|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	Then look for it.    Look for results of Bush's tax cuts.    I got a refund of about $30, and my paycheck had 14 cents more every two weeks. That's the cut _I_ got.    But because of Bush's tax cuts, and his expensive, illegal, and immoral war of choice, I ended up paying much more in state and local taxes, to make up for slashed funds from the feds.    The legislation doesn't explicitly SAY "slash taxes for the rich, not for the poor" that's what the effects are.    A person has to be capable of reasoning to see the connection.    Since Reagan, the Republicans have been babbling about how slashing taxes for the rich will have a "Trickle Down" effect. We STILL haven't seen that, 28 years later.|`|2XIsvCzNaa	The taxes have been lowered too much during this abomination of this administration.|`|Q3TGJMdkaa	I can show you the bad part    Look at the national debt and how it has ballooned due to his tax cuts for the rich:    http://zfacts.com/p/461.html    That same chart will show you how it decreased in compared to GDP under Clinton.    Bush did three things to skyrocket the debt from $5.7 trillion to $10 trillion:  1. He lowered taxes on the rich (by far the biggest item).  2. He invaded Iraq instead of winning in Afghan-Pakistan (another $600 B).  3. He loosened controls on Wall Street.   As it happens, McCain backed all three policies: (1) He backed Bush's tax cuts for the rich and now wants to give them bigger tax cuts. (2) He was gung-ho for the Iraq war from the start. (3) When Katie Couric asked Sarah Palin to name one time McCain suggested regulating Wall Street, she couldn'tbecause he never did. He crowed in the Wall Street Journal how he was always against regulation.|`|RuUUPWYUaa	Eight long years of Bush's failed policies overall is enough!|`|13db40225fc025aff3b81b2609fc6918aa	you seriously don't expect intelligent answers to this do you?The best way to save the economy is to raise taxes on corporations and the rich.That way they can give the money to the lower class.This will assist the lower class in getting an education,keep their pregnancy rates down,get a better job (since the higher corporate taxes will increase hiring)Health care will improve (the government always manages better than the private sector).Robin Hood economics are the most effective means to fix the economy.|`|qbxNKKs3aa	its worded differently but yes its in there. |`|f1ecec25428774ecc93857a3b57ba395aa	Obama said it was bad, what more proof do you need.

Bush completely drained the surplus Clinton created in about 2 years in office.|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	you seem confused. when "McBush" is used it means McCain (aka: McSame, McShame, the old man or the geezer). therefore it's not Bush's failed plans you need to check out, it's McCain's proposal you need to look at.

I have not been able to find anything that even says there is a formal verification process.  I think nobody ever envisioned that someone who is not eligible would try to run.    Take a look at the facts regarding this issue:  1.  A lawsuit was filed (more maybe others also) by a democrat even.  He would not waste his time if he had no evidence.  2.  The judge dismissed it because the plaintiff had no "standing", not based on any truth to the claims.  This just means the plaintiff has not been harmed by this and has no basis for the lawsuit.  My question is a lawsuit should not be necessary---there should be some formal method to verify the candidate is eligible.  3.  Why didn't Obama just show his stuff in the lawsuit instead of filing delay tactics.  Regardless of if he is eligible to be president or not, he is hiding something.    Obama's Kenyan grandmother has said he was born in Kenya.    Bottom line, please show me the evidence of your first statement, that they submitted paperwork that shows eligibility.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	They won't listen to the truth even if it were to come up and smash them in the side of the head. And they claim liberals are the ones who were 'brainwashed'.     As to those youtube sites, which I still cannot fathom how youtube became such a paramour for truth. Forget sites that have have built up years of legitimate reputations for searching and posting the truth.     Anyway, the birth certificate from the first video was from Connecticut. Connecticut uses a different form than Hawaii. The certifications and seals are also different. In my line of work, I have handled certified copies of birth certificates from all over the world, there were never any 'original' birth certificates because, by law, they must remain in the state/country in which the child is born. There were many birth certificates that did not have any creases in them, it all depends on how the state mails them and how they are handled after being received. Many did not have a raised seal, only a state seal sticker which some states use instead of a raised seal. Many were certified on the back and couldn't be see from the front. The office I worked in had raised seals that barely made any impression and would not scan. And, yes, I have seen amended birth certificates and very few looked anything like the one on youtube. Each state has their own laws for creating amended birth certificates.     Now as to the second youtube video. All that shows is that anything can be copied, clipped, cut, pasted and manipulated to show any view the creator of the clip wants the viewer to see. It does not prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Obama's birth certificate on the web was forged in any way, shape, or form. Anymore than that video showing a star is going to crash into the Earth in 2012 shows the truth. And not everyone who posts on youtube is a computer expert or expert in anything else.    Rather than using youtube, how about going to one of those sites I talked about previously, you know the ones that have spent years and years building legitimate reputations for searching and finding the real truth behind the lies. And, whether you believe it or not, they are not controled by the liberals or anyone else that has a so-called agenda.

If cheap labor was scarce, these jobs will pay more.     With all the job layoffs recently, I think out of work Americans will demand the illegals are shown the gate, hopefully in a new border fence.   If I needed the job an illegal had, I would call I.C.E.

Maybe he and Obama will become friends and ease world tensions. Seems to me he can be said to be doing a good job.|`|5zBEU99kaa	Putin is doing an excellent Job! In fact he has done everything the United States should be doing!    Balanced the Budget.     Paid off the National Debt and IMF loans Early     Banned Foreign Lobbyists    Established a State owned Central bank accountable to the government     Actively expanded trade and has brought Russia to the threshold of resuming it's role as a World Superpower.     During the same time Putin did this in Russia the US has:    Expanded deficit spending     More than doubled the debt,     Continues to be at the mercy of the Federal Reserve Bank (A Private Bank accountable to a private board that pretty much does whatever it wants and reports it to congress later)     Done nothing about foreign lobbyists    Continued to export jobs and increase the trade deficit     As result the US is entering yet another financial crisis, has over-extended it's military to the point of endangering domestic safety and is on the verge of becoming another Great Britain - a former world power resting on it's laurels.|`|UcizgK8maa	It depends on what side you are on. If it's the US side,  then we are being intimidated and tested by Putin and it's BHO who is drawing that negative attention. That didn't happen under Bush. This is Russia's way of welcoming BHO to the world political arena.     If your on Putin's side then he is working his plan and planning his work to once again grow Russia in to military and political power, which was lost in the 1980s. That is clued moving the USA out of the way any way he can.|`|zQWNapb7aa	Yes.|`|uGeo5zfSaa	Yeah. Just look at the riots.

I'd hate to be related to this sick individual who only got elected because of his line of BS while campaigning.If he is all about  a dream where all men are created equal, that doesn't mean giving freedom to those who are out to kill us.

fKFvzlzQaa	Gun control will not do it.    gun control only affects law abiding citizens. Gun control has no effect on criminals.    Large numbers of Illegal guns, including fully automatic machine guns for criminal turf wars  are smuggled into the United states of America along with thousands of tons of illegal drugs each year. Gun control laws will not prevent those illegal guns from coming in and going to gang members who pay very high prices for them, especially the fully automatic machine guns, those are a real status symbol in the gang culture.    Legalizing drugs has been tried and does not work.    the only thing that does work is much longer Prison Sentences for violent criminals and drug dealers to get them off the streets and keep them off the streets.    The states with the longest Prison Sentences for violent criminals are the ones with the lowest crime rates.    Very long Prison Sentences, 25 years or more for violent criminals do work. those laws keep the violent felons off the street and out of circulation so that they cannot train new generations of violent criminals.|`|6nS62bB8aa	Yes, black people could stop raising racist children.    Here's how it works.    Black kids grow up hearing parents talk about that evil Whitey.  Now, your black, and you need to be proud of that, but you'll never get anywhere because Whitey controls everything.    So now I have to love myself for being black, and hate myself for being black.    Y'know...I can't live like this, both loving and hating myself for the same reason. I can't kill myself, and that other black dude reminds me too much of myself. So I can kill him to kill the black man inside me that I hate.    Is any of this ringing true?  Are black kids raised to hate white people? Do black kids, hanging out together, talk about hating white people?    Can you "own your blackness" but not "own" the hatred in your own heart?|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	Not until they are happy|`|qGh1HhPwaa	End Poverty, don't ask me how|`|B07sKfdvaa	The best thing that could be done would be getting rid of subsidized urban housing.

They are lumped into housing projects, simply to make sure that the Democratic vote stays concentrated in certain areas.  I don't know how to offer these people a chance, after the Dem's have made it party policy to keep them oppressed, but something needs to be done!|`|4bb99c41576ff3f2f8e3b5fc75e5945baa	I think Obama needs to address that very problem.

I believe that some black people intentionally commit crimes just to have all of the amenities given to them in prison. It's sort of a welfare system.

When a drug addict is wanting a hit and trying to get smoke at a store and attacks the clerk that could be horrible.  Gun Control would be a definite plus to the problem.  I think a good thing would be offering people in the inner cities a way out i.e. scholarships, government grants  along with a rehabilitation period to teach them a new way to live.   The problem with the inner cities is that everyone wants out but can't achieve it so it because a cycle generation after generation since they live what they have learned.  They need to learn the skills for the real world|`|TKbYavhzaa	Not cramming a bunch of desperately poor people into a tiny piece of crappy real estate would be a start.  NYC has been completely turned around, which you can credit (at least partly) to Giuliani's expansion of the NYPD.    Not true - there are still plenty of poor people in the city.  The culture has become less lawless, though -- people know if they call the police, they'll actually come.  And much more of the police force actually comes from the neighborhoods they are policing; having people that grew up in the area both makes them better police, and makes the average citizen trust them more.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Until the Black culture sees the "gangsta" image as negative, stops calling their women names that Yahoo won't publish, and more Black children have responsible live-in fathers, then that culture will have problems in society.    Violence has become a rite of passage for most urban young Black males.  Until that stops, nothing will change.  White people can't force change on them.      The Black community has to act as a community to change a cultures standards.  When education and responsibility become more important than having a tough criminal "image" in the 'hood, we will experience a change in mindset and behavior in those crime prone areas.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	Throw them a b-ball|`|6eoMqJF0aa	I thought that ended with barry's election

When he gets control of the Supreme court, which he will, he will extend his presidency beyond the present limits and be president for the rest of his life, just like Castro.     There is going to be a great influx of illegal Africans into America and no one will hear about it or try to stop it.     Governor Paterson of New York State, has already expressed interest in allowing non citizens to vote in the general elections. All they need to do is establish an address to qualify. If that becomes the law, then all of those illegals will guarantee the presidents re election until he can change the term limit.

In Germany, they are giving their citizens $5K for their old cars if you buy a new one.     The tax cut is a good idea too. Who is going to buy a new car in this market unless they get a really good deal. I'd rather take the bus than have a $300/mo car payment or else walk. With 401Ks down the tubes and jobs disappearing by the thousands as we speak, who is thinking about a new car? What is wrong with walking?  Lose some weight, support the local community transporation system and have more money to spend on real essentials. Vehicles are a drain (depreciating asset) on a budget especially one that is uncertain.

f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	You have to be 18 in order to choose where you want to live.   If your dad doesn't allow you to move in with your mom, your mom needs to take your dad back to court and seek custody. Depending on your age, your wishes to live with your mom  will be taken into consideration. However, that is not a guarantee that you will get your way. The court will look at what is in your best interest.  Disrespecting your dad and calling him names is not going to help you.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	Sounds like you do live with your mom and you just visit dad.    When you are 18, you get to choose.    Until then, the court decides custody arrangements in the best interests of the child, and they may or may not care about your opinion. Generally they are more inclined to at least hear of it as you get older.     My guess is that  since you are not old enough to even tell us how old you are now while asking us how old you have to be to do something, that day is far away, and you should get used to it, make new friends at dad's place if you have to, but work on it as it is.    I'd recommend talking to a guidance counselor at school if you are this upset, and see if you can get that kind of independent advice on what is your best path from here.|`|AA12009752	usually when there teens because my legal study teacher said that if there too young they can some time be not conscience on choices to make whether to live with mom or dad childrens are easily bribe and the other parents won't know say you ask you son to live with me if i give you ice cream for dessert. The children then can't make a conscience dicision on who to live with and so i kids can't choose. But they will usually ask the parents some question too to see which parent is best for the child for example if one parents smoke let say the mom smokes of course they give the kid to the dad. thats all i know|`|iFYDJyIZaa	Divorced kids?  Children shouldn't be married in the first place.    Anyway, you do have some say. If you're competent, and old enough to voice your opinion, you'll be given a chance to say who you would prefer to live with. However, if your mother is not a suitable parent, they won't just let you live with her.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	it depends on what your state says. in texas i believe if you are 12 you can move but you have to tell ajudge. it is different in every state.|`|VDgLVHtGaa	Is your dad with you in the room every weekend?

And in order to change the custody arrangement, your mother would need to file for a modification, and she needs to prove that there has been a significant change in the circumstances since the order was put into place.  You can always refuse to go with him.  He may get the message, or he may sue your mother for contempt of court.  A faster and cheaper way to do this would be for you and your mother to request a family therapy session with a qualified child therapist.  You can dump it all on him in front of a third party, and that might make him agree to your wishes.|`|579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	Was there a custody agreement? unless your mother fights for custody of you, then you have a problem. It is usually typical for the judge to ask a child 13 or over who they want to live with. There must have been some reason why your mother doesnt have custody at this time.   If you just want to leave, it looks like you are going to have to wait until you are 18 or until they both agree to allow you to live where you want to live.|`|ygccpU2paa	Your mother would have to file a modification of visitation form with the family court where the original custody/visitation agreement was signed off on by a judge.  If she doesn't provide your father his visitation, she can be found in contempt of court so her hands are tied.  If she doesn't choose to file a motion for this change, or if she does file and it doesn't get approved by the judge, then your visits will continue for as long as your dad wants them until you turn 18.|`|aaklfRk3aa	Okay sweetie.   I don't know if this is for every state.  But where I live (Idaho) the age is 12.   My sister married a guy with 4 kids and his kid decided to go live with his Mom, instead of with my sister and his Dad.   He was court ordered to live with his Dad, and had the same visitation as you did with his Mom. But he just said that he didn't want to go home one day, they tried to fight it but since he is 12 there was nothing they could do about it.     Hope this helps!|`|8tdW9FUHaa	dang i'm pretty dang sure you have the right to live with your mom. same with my father man. ive decided on a distinctness between dad and father and by those means hes a father and a pretty lousy person at that. the day after they divorced i saw my dad with his girlfriend.

May have been good at the time, but that is another issue.|`|xy7Zjsu1aa	Only if you are an idiot.    The vast majority of the spending bill being called a "stimulus" bill has nothing to do with stimulus, and nothing to do with creating jobs etc.    You Obama supporters got what you voted for: "Words...just words"    Ignorant/stupid people have emboldened Democrats: they now know all they have to do is say what you want to hear, and you dolts follow.    I don't doubt something could be done by the government, but handing out birth control, or making a park etc. isn't going to get it done.    I went to the Whitehouse web site to see what's in the bill, but like a lot of other Obama promises...it seems to have been forgotten by the guy making the promise.

If he'd denied the bailout and the stimulus a year ago, our economic situation might have already begun to correct itself.      The real people to blame for our economic situation are the predators in the housing and lending sector.  Yes, that means congressmen and senators, predatory lenders, but most of all ignorant borrowers that got in deep over their heads, and now the rest of us have to suffer for it.  Blaming anyone but the people that signed their names to these stupid loans is like blaming the gun manufacturer and not the person that pulls the trigger.    Low taxes, small government, and free markets based upon supply side economics are the only cure for our ills right now!|`|Fg2mCLr2aa	Please, if you want to blame anyone for this mess it would be Clinton and the Democrats who made massive provisions to the community reinvestment act in 1995 which forced banks to give out subprime loans.|`|uGeo5zfSaa	Clinton's trickle stayed on the blue dress.|`|tmDKqUGpaa	This does not have anything to do with your answer, but we need to start working together and quit complaining.

M5XjqI40aa	M103, a forgettable heavy tank design of the cold war.    Despite the formidable array of arms, the system was dogged by reliability problems, a short road range and its sheer size. In the temperate and hilly terrain of Europe, the M103 faired below expectations. It's size alone made the system very difficult to conceal along the Cold War fronts throughout Europe. A new engine, bringing the road range from the measly 80 miles to over 300 miles was implemented in what would become the M103A2 but it was not meant to be. The M103 was dissolved from service with the United States Army in a few short years, bringing an end to the new generation of M103 Heavy Tank.|`|gPvOcB6oaa	I dont know..M103 ???|`|UjPArJZ6aa	A big boy? *giggles*    Looks down...Yes, Mel starred this, that's why I found myself in the military section.  :P    Mmm, riding crops Mel?

Though voters showed in the last 2 elections who they trusted, republicans will not give up their old failed economic formula of trickle down economics. Now, rather than allow better ideas to blossom into growth, progress, and jobs, they want to obstruct the man who has reached out to include them. They are a bunch of unimaginative twits sucking lemons. Republicans have proved for the last 8 years they do not care about the average American. Like Obama said, "Now is the time to put away childish things."|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Because Republicans don't believe in compromise, at least not on their part. They will demand compromise from the Democrats, but the only thing that will be good enough for them is total capitulation.     There's no reason to repeat the failed policies of a generation of supply side economics, Republican tantrums or no. Let Limbaugh have a fit. When the public realizes that the dittoheads who have been calling Republican offices in Congress are the same few people with their phones on redial, the people will demand change.

It is meant for differing groups to come together and work things out.  It is an adversarial system.  I think what is meant when we hear "bipartisanship" is  the desire to see politicans think for themselves instead of doing what their particular group says is right.  I think we also want to see a return of respect, decency and civility, instead of one side always having to demonize the other.  I think the closest we'll ever get to 'bipartisan' is when we all remember we are all Americans first.|`|35ZJauLkaa	Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and Barack Hussein Obama|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Obama has investigated everyone.

Unfortunately, the GOP is using a dangerous tactic of obstructionism which will only do harm to our country.

Various efforts by groups of Protestant and Catholic clergy, along with the Urban League, NAACP, Congress of Racial Equality, black activists, individuals both white and black and, of course, Martin Luther King Jr., as well as other subsets of his movement, are what forced civil rights to be crafted into federal law.    The National Opinion Research Center discovered that by 1963 the number of Americans who approved neighborhood integration had risen 30 percent in 20 years, to 72 percent. Americans supporting school integration had risen even more impressively, to 75 percent.    The efforts of politicians were needed to write all the changes and efforts into law. Politicians did not lead charge on civil rights  again, they just took credit, especially the Democrats.

Coincidentally, this was when Democrats had control of congress.|`|xy7Zjsu1aa	It is sickening to see politics causes ANYONE to ignore the situation at hand.    I find it difficult to believe, but it is looking clear; many Americans have no idea what is at stake here.    You are allowing your eagerness to oppose "the other side" you have lost sight of reality.    This "brilliant" President is speaking now. And he is using his tried and true tactic. Simply say things have to change, and the added tactic since he won: "I won you need to do what I say"    He mentioned a "doubling of the national debt over the last eight years". This is a rate of about 7%/yr, give or take as he proposes adding another 10% in a single day.    Amazing.    Now he is criticizing the idea we need to take time, this after he/they criticized the last admin in Oct for acting fast without taking care to do the right thing.    This kind of thing is not something you just sign off on. ESPECIALLY when you look at the spending being proposed.|`|Q2ZWARgqaa	CONSERVATIVES ARE WORRIED ABOUT...    communists like B.

History has shown that when wealthy people get tax cuts, they (wisely) tend to save that money and/or use it to pay down debt.

Unlike liberals, Republicans do not expect anybody to spend money on them, we make our own money.    And one rich Republican spending spree could feed a village for a year.    In the words of Charles Barkley, "Poor people have been voting for democrats for 50 years, and they are still poor".    Instead of hating the rich, you should try and become rich.    No jobs,,,, huh that is funny because I just looked in the Michigan Craigslist and there are thousands of help wanted jobs.    But Tony, you are a good example of the liberal stereo-type, you blame others for your lack of responsibility.    But you are young, and it is not too late for you to start taking charge of your life, do not let others stop you from achieving your dream.|`|Z03zgM0maa	It doesn't make any sense. They use that extra money from tax cuts to buy themselves Ferrari's and private islands. Republicans automatically think they will offer more jobs as long as they have more money. Wrong. They ship jobs overseas to sweatshops in China. Woooow real helpful to Americans.    I am glad Obama is putting a limit on amount of stimulus money going towards executive pay. The executives sit in their offices and collect millions and millions of dollars. I don't think they need any more help.

Maybe you assume too much.  I think that many of those who provide the jobs should be given some slack.  Possibly, just possibly if they are not taxed so heavily they will be able to hire a few more people.  Like you for example if you are willing to work like the rest of us.|`|gau0w8LMaa	The tax cuts are for corporations and small businesses. It would be for capital gains, thus increased investment and putting more money into the system. That increases velocity.     That is what you liberals don't get. If there is money to be given out, you don't have a right to it.     Rich people are the investors in these companies. It is the companies that will stimulate the economy, not just rich people. Obama himself said that.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	The stupid Republicans always get it wrong.    Nobody thinks about getting money from anyone, it's the question on the REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS that keep pushing a tax cuts for their rich friends touting that their rich friends....rather than keep opening company oversea and moving the headquarter of their companies to Cayman island.....or Dubai in Dick Cheney's case, they will somehow, magically care about America and invest the money back into the system rather than just enriching themselves even further.    This whole trickle down economic is already been tried since Reagan time, put into a whole different level in Bush Jr. time and give us this whole freakin crisis.  I will suggest to those Republican followers of Druggie Limbauh to have more Omega-3 and Ginkgo Biloba to help their brain growth.....but if they still listen to that Hypocryte liars after all those scandals, I don't think those will help.|`|u9EsbutJaa	here's something to think about the five richest americans Gate's Buffet.

oAlOvNeEaa	Go to court and fight it, if the van did not have flashers on and the cop did not have his lights on, you have every right to toot the horn. You could not see what was going on and it is against the law to get out of your car at a light to check. The horn is to get attention she got their attention and they should have just said hey we have an accident please drive around. The cop should have understood. Rookies are usually unreasonable trying to make themselves a name. Your mother should have signed the ticket without asking for another cop to be present. But that is not unreasonable either. What state is this?     Never argue with cops that is what court is for, just sign you ticket and save the fight for court. Always write your stuff with word and spell check to avoid the anal spell checkers online.|`|UlXHuZuQaa	Face it we all beep our horns when we shouldn't.  The reality is in most states the reason for having a horn is to use it to alert others to a danger.  - Also, your mom did not 'sign the ticket' she further delayed the officer who was dealing with the accident AND involve another officer who probably had other things to do, because for some bizarre reason that you do not explain she wanted some kind of a witness or something. You do not name your state, I am sure there is some language about use of the horn in the code.  Certainly it is not required equipment for the sole purpose of expressing your irritation and impatience.  Also, all signing a ticket is is your promise to come to court so as to avoid your having to be held until you can be brought to the judge.  In other words, neither you or the officers are tied up having to deal with you being arrested and held until court is in session over a minor matter.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	Wow - that was pretty mean about the spelling.  Not necessary at all.  Anyway, we're in the spell-check era!  You know, in theory I'm behind the police because they have a tough job and it can be dangerous.  But I have found the majority of police I've dealt with are overly aggressive and mean and give out tickets when they aren't deserved.  They don't listen when you try and present your side of the argument.   I think they need to remember that they get paid with out tax dollars and they shouldn't be abusing their power.      In this case I think that he should have listened to your mom's side of the story and let her go with a warning.|`|iFYDJyIZaa	Sounds like there may be more to the story that you're not telling us.    I doubt they would give you a ticket for an unjustifiable reason.|`|OVUkamlpaa	Blowing the on?  The copy was behing you?  Witch is stupid?  Kinda of a prick?  Few longer minutes?  But the thing is though?  In the start of November 5th?  Your dad was driving, and your mom got the ticket?    How do you expect anyone to make sense of this question?  Why don't you print this question and give it to your English teacher, then repost it after she makes a few corrections?|`|I11BEwi5aa	I'm not surprised. I always had bad experience with cops. I could be wrong but in my eyes, cops , more often than not , psychologically want to control people for control's sake.    Cops in and of itself might not be bad but it usually attracts people who are *******. IMHO.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Blowing the horn a ticket?  Maybe a correct charge, creating a scene at a wreck?

There are two sets of frequencies, one  for analog and one for digital which doubles for HD.  The analog is much larger mainly because it is based on technology standard set around the 1940's.    Although it is truly inefficient, the reason is that the government wants to take those frequencies and SELL them to mostly the cell phone industry to further expand their coverage.      The fear is that people who waited cannot afford the remaining $20 or so for the converter with the current economy.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	They need a break rom "important issues" they been working hard on spending mu grandchildrens money.

First off, contrary  to right wing propaganda it is not a "pork plan" It is an economic recovery package designed to create jobs and rebuild our infrastructure, rejuvenate our industrial base and reintroduce regulations. It is a foreign concept to Republicans, but he is trying to design it so that even obstructionist, reactionary, narrow-minded conservatives can support it. I guess you haven't heard of Filibuster, but through Filibuster, just a few of the obstructionist, reactionary Republicans could slow down the passage of the bill and hold our country hostage to a few more months of failed conservative economic policies left over from the  inept Bush administration.

Obama chose a republican senator from New Hampshire for his cabinet that will be replaced with a democrat.  That gets him one vote closer.    I'm still waiting for someone to explain how sending money to Guam or buying condoms will stimulate the economy.  At best, those belong in the annual budget.

"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous than standing armies... if the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of currency.. .the banks and corporations that will grow up around them and will deprive the people of their property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered." - Thomas Jefferson    And he was undeniably right.    All of you who want Pres. Obama to fail for your own sick and demented reasons, its going to come as an incredible loss for 'Americans' NOT 'America'.

Out of the 10 years those 3 were handing out cash a senator with only 2 years in the house was their number two money receiver.     These 3 with their defensive line, Democrats, caused where this country is now. Bill Clinton agrees. Now with their number two money man in the White House and these three stooges now his economic advisers just what type of chance do you think they have?     All these billions are not going to anything but to enlarge a government that has already shown over the last 100 years can not be trusted. The only thing that has ever worked is tax cuts.

GMYNuFCDaa	Socialism is not a workable system with real people. Your friend is a dim whit, all you have to do is check the history of Socialism.    Socialism doesn't work because people will not work hard if they can't see a reward for it. In socialism you get as much for doing nothing as working hard, so people tend not to do much at all. No purely socialist country has ever been able to feed it's people for long ... they fail every time.    I am a genius, but genius isn't enough to understand every problem. Expertise is more important, though intelligence helps one to see things more clearly, but not always to explain to those who don't have the beans for it who won't know the difference anyway. Try asking a genius trained in engineering about this, and you can probably forget it.    Please lol, you're putting me on right? I just  test high, you wouldn't notice me out of a crowd of average wankers (Yes, I am an American and I actually use that word! lol) anyway, and I'm quite stupid in many ways, but not in social sciences or cause and effect situations, which both are applicable here.     Did you run out of dictionarys?     Socialism is basically an economical system in which resources like land, business, money, factories and all that are entered into a collective, which in practical application always ends up being the government ... which is the start of human nature rearing it's ugly head.     Those who control the socialist resources are ALWAYS reluctant to give up control, to put it lightly. You end up with people working for a ruling class and getting little in return. To the degree of socialism you get about that degree of governmental abuse. Of course the people are not to excited to work hard for little reward and ALWAYS end up with sorry productive output, and that brings everything down, and you end up with dirt poor people and a weak country.    edit:    Those who say socialism is more like capitalism than communism are wrong. There are degrees of socialism, but pure socialism is pretty much for all practical purposes, communism.  You'd better read the dictionary definition before you get confused by all of the out of balance ideologically biased opinions on the subject.    http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/s...|`|c4b57b3534465ec39ec8b5c38862f872aa	Your question sounds like it was written by a genius, and you are asking!!!!|`|rsFWSelnaa	never define wealth  in terms of money , wealth of education should be spread around , wealth of democracy, wealth of equality follow|`|94hXoyWCaa	I heard the call Bobby I'm here for you  I dated a waitress on the small island of Maui the waitress and bar tenders all know each other I noticed that she left large tips [100%] asked her why ''We all do it to each other makes us feel good' intellect of a three min egg  Told her the story of the little girl who would walk into a shop and get change for $5 and that walk into a store and get change again five ones for a five than do it all over again Someone ask her ''why do you keep doing this little girl'' ans ''someone going to make a mistake an it's not going to be me''  See i know what socialism is....... mental masturbation....''It's free''|`|yb4FbFiSaa	Socialism is very similar to capitalism.  In capitalism, the employer makes a profit from the work of the employee.  Say the employee does 20 worth of work, the employee is paid 10 for it and the rest is profit.  In socialism, the employee does 20 worth of work, is paid 5 for it and the other 5 is given to somebody who turns up and demands a house and an income courtesy of the state.  You get the general idea.  All good fun.|`|uAy7Y6HPaa	Socialism is just 1 step below communism.  The only difference is that you get to elect your leaders.      Communism=bad.|`|52efeea3c9eae1de26f16355e12a7d09aa	Socialism doesn't work because it is based on the premise that all individuals will give up their personal ambition for the good of society as a whole. Most people only really care about their family and friends, if they want to give money to anyone else they will do so via a charity.    The result of socialism is a lot of poor people and a few very rich people, an example being the killing of the Tzar in Russia only to be replaced by an equally rich social elite. This is exactly the opposite of what socialism is meant to achieve, and the reason socialism fails is it is a naive vision of society that has no practical success.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	your friend has a good prosperity consciousness.

Socialism is where The CEO of a multinational corporation does not get to make 350x of the salaries of all of the corporation's hourly employees, and does not get a huge bonus for laying half of us off because he made a stupid investment in corporate jets and a yacht.    Socialism is where ALL of us pay taxes to the government for social services like welfare, food stamps, unemployment, and at least minimal access to meaningful health care.    Socialism is about recognizing and honoring the interdependence of labor and capital and treating each with respect because we are not a bunch of rats in a jungle fighting for existence, but a society working together for common purposes like a safe place to raise our kids, safety of our selves and our meager belongings.|`|aJWjqaAPaa	As Lenin wrote in 1917, state-monopoly capitalism is a complete material preparation for socialism, the threshold of socialism, a rung on the ladder of history between which and the rung called socialism there are no intermediate rungs.

The new mega-injections of government investments championed by La Bama are intended to break the momentum of a recession were probably more than half-way through suffering.    The bold thing for La Bama to do would be to tell the panic-mongers to shove it and to tell taxpayers to ride out the rest of the tough times while Washington gets its own economic house in order.

He wants to raise taxes and spending in a bad economy. I a bad economy, you slash spending and taxes.

He's never had to meet a payroll. He's never had to work within a budget. He knows nothing but government. He's also, as most Democrats are, anti-military. Funny thing is, defending the country is the primary role of the federal government.      I am a Libertarian. I am anti-war. EVERYONE should be anti-war; it is the breakdown in society, however, there are times when we MUST defend ourselves. Obama does not seem to agree. Clinton did not either. But the funny thing is, Clinton spent billions of dollars bombing mountains where mostly people did not reside. He was afraid to put boots on the ground cause American's might get killed.     Democrats!    I hate nuclear bombs, but as long as others have them, unfortunately, we must.  Obama is a dangerous man. He is exactly the wrong man for the wrong times.

AA11632370	I'm from Bangladesh and I was following the events of our country very closely for over 35 years now.    The one main challenge being faced by the present government in Bangladesh headed by Sk. Hasina is to talk less and try to unite the nation. She has successfully divided the nation among Pro-liberation and Anti-liberation forces and made sure that the constant bickering does not stop in near future.    Her Home Minister made a gaffe immediately after taking oath as MP that already cost many attacks by AL student wing BCL and also its labour wing and so many other 'wings' that she would have difficulty to manage them once they can 'taste' the blood again like they did when AL was in power 1996-2001.    However, I commend the AL as a whole to have shown its muscle by getting overwhelming majority when the BNP looters almost robbed the country during 2001-2006 tenure.    So, coming back to your question, the biggest challenge for Bangladesh government is to maintain modesty and show respect to the people who have voted them as well as who did not. They need to unite the country the way Barack Obama is doing in the USA.    The present government would have no excuse left under their sleeve if they fail to govern. But early indication showed that old-habit-die-hard attitude of the AL and its different and numerous organisation under its umbrella who are actual driving force for the AL leadership and who ruined it in its 1991 and 2001 polls.    Hope they can concentrate on governing and try to achieve 25% of what they have promised the nation before the election by way of publishing and trumpeting the Election Manifesto and bring this unfortunate nations out of vicious cycle of poverty-illiteracy-poverty.    Btw, the greatest challenge should not be to bring or buy more PhD degrees for its PM from abroad, as the last tenure 1996-2001 was utilised and the PM should not go on frequent foreign trips under the disguise of this or that matter.    God save Bangladesh!|`|41654d02889988fda122d249e98748f8aa	The challenges are so many that the space here is not enough to describe them all!  Your question should be rephrased to read: .......NOT faced by the government of Bangladesh!  In that case I would have a few answers, like  the government of B. does not face the challenge  1. of a declaration of war by Russia!  2. of a direct hit of a large meteor!  3. that the money of B. will ever replace the US-Dollar in world-wide commercial dealings!    Sorry, but all other probable challenges seem to be there, so that until now I do not understand,why Mujibur Rachman ever wanted that B. should be an independent nation!
zrR7KXCnaa	What would like to see?  I think something along the Libertarianism and Socialism...  More freedom but also equality if possible.  I guess something like employees ownership of their business through stocks would be great.  And fixed ratio between min and max wage in a company.  Not really a policy but, I would like to see a self serve stores where you would do the same as with wending machines...  Changing all instate money to resource points or something and with that totally virtualising money.  More direct democracy with a help of modern technology like a forum idea pool on how to self governance your region...  more regional sovereignty.  A tougher diplomatic stance towards USA and it's cowboy (gung-ho) diplomacy.  Drug and prostitution legalisation.  Transforming religion to a group activity / organised groups and taxing them. Completely separating state from religion.  Reduce the budget for agriculture and increase it for new technologies.  even more civil rights.  United army with non lethal weapons that would be used only for peace keeping.  More environmental policies like funding hybrid and electric cars, turning ITER to our main energy source. Making CERN a part of "government".  More funds for ESA, and consequently EU sending first man to Mars.  A road plan to develop underdeveloped countries of the "third world" so that migrations wouldn't be of political and economic nature but of personal preference.  And more...

It is not a good time for UNIONS and also workers advocates~it seems like this is a dollar short and a day too late~do you think illegal immigrants will be covered under this plan?|`|oMOiAFRBaa	the Fair Pay bill was an open acknowledgement by the democrats that women, Republican and Democrat, are too stupid, meek, or incompetant to negotiate their own salaries and therefore need Uncle Sam to step in and do it for them.  It's pretty humiliating and disgraceful to them, I would think.    Edit: And to all the fools who insist on the "70 cents to every dollar" rule, why would any company hire men if that were true?  Companies are in the business of making money, why wouldn't they hire ALL women if this were true and take the 30% discount to the bottom line?  Some people miss the obvious.|`|0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	It's another way to control the sheeple.|`|HBa3IbXEaa	The bill is irrelevant - the entire economic system is changing.

It should have been done a long time ago. Women only get paid 78 cents to every dollar a male makes on average in the United States.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	Fair pay is called capitalism.  If you do a good job you are rewarded for it so that they can keep you.  Employers want money, not gender wars.    Women get paid less than men in the same jobs because they are less experienced, educated, and did not ask for raises.  They also have the liability of maternity leave to count against their experience.|`|fh9QBfXpaa	Personally I don't think it was the right way to go about equal pay (not that there is a better way).    I'm all for equal pay for all people with equal skill levels, but making this bill is just giving CEOs a legal excuse to decrease the salary of men to match that of the women rather than raise the women's pay.    I also think you're going to quickly see the men's bonuses on the rise again though because they negotiate their salaries a lot more than women do.    Either way, it's good to see that we're still making forward progress on issues of equality.|`|2ZXh00C5aa	a step in the right direction but definitely not an end to sexist practices in the work place.|`|J8ZVcKEAaa	It is an excellent choice, they are taking some money out of the paychecks of many people who honestly make "Too Much" money.

The Patriot act can be repealed by congress, Struck down by the Courts or allowed to sunset, but it cannot be abolished by decree of the President.    So perhaps the question should be why hasn't Obama called upon congress to repeal or amend the patriot act, or instructed the DOJ prepare a legal challenge to the more onerous portions of the Patriot Act?|`|e4hyq5hsaa	He voted in favor of the patriot act.

893e1acecd8adc509eb651f96cc70122aa	As far as how much does CSI make, it depends on what part of the country you live in.  Cops in larger cities usually make more than small towns.  Not that the larger towns are better, it just is the economics of the area.  I was a detective in So. FL and my dept. started CSI in mid 30's.  Top out being upwards of 50k a year.  They require a min. two year degree.    Lots of colleges are now offering tech degrees in CSI.  U of TN Knoxville has a world class academy.    Many smaller dept. use officers as CSI as they can't afford to have dedicated personnel for that job.  Get as much education as you can afford before applying.  Take any job you can get for the experience and once you have the education and experience go to where you "really" want to work.  Good luck|`|e61e97ce7197ef3797fdc64f3b935342aa	There's no such thing as a CSI. There are three different jobs. A Scene Of Crime Officer (The one who goes to a crime scene and collects evidence) is on around 20k and someone on the course Im currently studying has to do a little bit more training and she will be a Scene Of Crime Officer although you have to go through the official Forensic Science agency (which its name alludes me) and pay 8 thousand pound.    A Forensic Scientist analyzes the evidence and is on around the same again.    Although you can go on to do these jobs after a 2 year college course and successfully completion of the official Forensic Science body which I cant remember its darn name. You still have to be accepted. Because of shows like CSI there is an abundance of people going for thees jobs so a degree is advised. An example is the girl I mention earlier tried out for the position there were over 200 applicants going for one job. She had the two year course that Im currently studying(The best great you can get) and a degree in Psychology.|`|qwaWd14vaa	As much as hollywood allows.

cae903cea51e27b7f33677a9e540a4b5aa	Yes, crime is at a high in the US, you are also right in saying that it should be a domestic priority. Our State officials cannot operate with a shoe string budget, and bring about the changes needed in many communities in America. They will need more funding from our US congress, and assistance from law enforcement agencies from the federal level.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	No, crime has been going down for many years.  It should not be a top priority for president Obama.|`|1b013cc3fe2d25b057fd14f52569f85caa	anytime the economy goes down, crime goes up.    many were spoiled during the Clinton years, it is hard to return from such good times to what some might call "normal"|`|45u7BzCUaa	Everything needs direct attention from the president.   The economy, crime, the educational system, health care, alternative energy, the war, the list goes on.  Crime is a priority however I think it can be taken care of on the State level.  More jails need to be erected, crimes need to be paid for with physical money and not just time in jail or community service so we're not the ones footin' the bill.  And sentences need to be kept no matter how good behavior might be if it's a second offense.  I like Cali's 3 strike rule.|`|4ABrY8Bdaa	Crime is not an issue that can be fixed domestically, but a choice by a fragile human being, who **** away his socialist oppurtunities (public education, handouts w/e...) and still is a **** up, sad truth really, its a choice, not a policy
Oq5a5hRhaa	The US has social security numbers. The UK has national insurance numbers. They are similar, but not exactly the same thing, and you certainly couldn't use a UK national insurance number as a US social security number.    A social security number has nine numbers, and is usually written in the format 123-45-6789. Social security numbers were originally designed to be used only for the collection and payment of social security, which is a form of welfare for the elderly. But each person having an individual number is so convenient for keeping records that the social security number began to be used for everything.    Is your cousin filling out the correct application for international students? If she is, she should just leave that part blank.|`|lL6oGDU8aa	They serve the same function, but have different names. There are 9 numbers in a social security number.    The school is probably just confused about the fact that she's not from the United States.

aGzLO9Oraa	Perhaps you believe what Al Gore told a group of teens and preteens.  He said not to listen to everything their parents tell them because their ideas are outdated.  Of course, he was speaking about his global warming issue.      http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-blog...    Don't listen to your parents because you can just go get an abortion without even telling them.  Have the teachers tell the students who their parents really should vote for.      Honor thy Father and thy Mother.  Any child who goes his/her own way without respect for authority will have some very difficult lessons to learn in life when they reach adulthood.  You can call that Republican if you want.  I just call it common sense.  Children have a lovely but warped view of real life.  They don't really get it until they are responsible for others and they should be equiped to meet that challenge when it happens.    Even siblings can be very different from each other while having the very same upbringing but all children should be provided the basics that will help a child grow into someone people can count on.|`|KX1R4OQfaa	I am a Republican and my husband is a push over, my kids get mostly disciplined from me.    Oh and I work outside of the home.    And my children do not get an allowance, however depending how good their grades are, and well they have done their chores determines the spending money I give them. (Just like in the real world, the better job you do, the more money you get)      So I would have to say your thesis is wrong|`|THRtsl83aa	That was kind of how I was raised, except my dad was the stay-at-home parent while my mom worked full time, because my dad was a landlord, so he had to be able to respond to tenants' phone calls.  But yeah, the whole parental authority, tough love, self-reliance thing - that pretty much sums it up.|`|otYOxmnuaa	I'm not sure if that sounds like a conservative upbringing -- it sounds like a traditional upbringing...liberal or conservative.    Teach your kids how to depend on themselves so they can be successful on their own.  Isn't that the point when raising kids?    I mean a lot of those ideals he points out go both ways...unless you're talking about really liberal families who let their kids do anything.|`|1amF7oNwaa	ONLY LIBERAL FOOLS BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT GORGE LAKOFF SAYS.|`|fB0gmEioaa	The left have nurtured our  children to death  and have psychologically crippled them because of it.|`|uGeo5zfSaa	I forgot. Liberals enjoy the "two mommy, two daddy" alternative families.    Whatever floats your boat.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	I can agree to a point... yes im a conservitive    "with the father having primary responsibility for supporting and protecting the family as well as the authority to set overall policy, to set strict rules for the behavior of children, and to enforce the rules. The mother has the day-to-day responsibility for the care of the house, raising the children, and upholding the father's authority"    At on point yes this was true, but in todays world with two working parents, the responsibility falls on both, and in a functional household, responsibiltys have to be shared.    however, i agree that you teach them they have to be independant, and that your not going to be there forever, so when they do get out into the world, there are some things they have to be able to know handle on their own. otherwise they end up with a victim mentailty. but also, my daughter and i have a very close and nurturing relationship at the same time. we horse around, play, spend alot of time having fun and doing things together. theres a line of discipline, and responsibility, but very open and loving.    Its clearly defined that theres a time to play, and a time for buisness, and the chores at this point aka responsibility has to be done first, if theres to be any reward. an allowance, sure, but only if the chores have been done for the week, witout us prodding and asking. but also shes given the oppurtunity to work for it if she wants extra.    Not saying theres not gimmies when i have the cash, but she knows what falls into that area =p    now my cousins who are libs, are VERY babied from their mother, are 26 and 29 and still living at home....im not kidding...|`|Q2ZWARgqaa	IDEAL FAMILY...    1.

That has to do with traditional family values, some of which have become antiquated in the 21st century.  But they are still good rules to live by.    My husband and I raise our children as a team.  They will respect us as long as they are living under our roof and they will be taught right from wrong.  If there is something wrong with teaching your children to be good, law-abiding citizens who have respect for other people, and leading by example, then there is something wrong with society.|`|AA10520346	Fairly close, depending on self-discipline was important but when I was down on my luck my family didn't let me get thrown out in the street. Belive me the women,ie: mom, aunts, and grandmothers meddle with your life, at least in my family but out of concern that your safe and secure not for gossip or power.|`|xy7Zjsu1aa	Sounds a bit whacked to me.    I think I'd represent typical conservative thought...    One parent needs to be the primary breadwinner, the other needs to be in the home.  A part time job is OK, but full time is not generally acceptable as the children need a solid home life and guidance.    The parents share equally in parental authority.    The parents lead by example in every facet of day to day life.     We feel it is best to live within your means, this is why we have little sympathy for those who start a family before they are financially secure. A couple with the primary breadwinner earning minimum wage is not going to be in a situation conducive to raising a family in a secure and stable environment.    Failure to provide guidance and discipline is irresponsible and the antithesis of love and nurturing.
89239f44272f2582fcdd0bed556489b2aa	There was a special on the history channel recently regarding the attempts to assasinate Hitler. It appears that, right after WW2 ended. people viewed the conspirators as traitors to Germany. That view morphed over the years as the Germans became familiar with the facts of the Holacaust. They started to acknowledge their past and the fact that the Nazis represented evil.     One of the events that made the Germans appreciate America was the Berlin airlift. The planes that, just a few years before had dropped bombs, were now delivering food and saving them from starvation...or Russian domination.     I think that the Italians were quicker to oppose Mussilini. From what I recall of history, the Italian people seemed to be reluctant warriors from the start.    The Japanese felt that the emporer was a God so they followed him without question. If "God" tells you to do something, you don't have a lot of options. I don't believe that there was any opposition to the war in Japan...except mild opposition from some leaders who had traveled to America like Yamamoto who thought the US would win...and grudginly followed orders as best he could. After the war, McArthur waited until the Emporer visited him and the people seemed to accept his leadership very well. McArthur actually wrote the Japanese post war consititution and I think there was a lot of respect for McArthur's handling of post war Japan. There are still a lot of deniers in Japan regarding Japanese WW2 conduct...and it taints relationships even today between Japan and it's neighbors. I think they hold their society holds ancestors in very high regard...almost like worship, so acknowledging that they did wrong is very diffciult for Japan.|`|85kWzSzuaa	I work with a German woman who survived the allied bombings.

"Although they are light years apart on policy issues, apparently Obama is fond of Bushs style of decorating.    Our new President plans to mostly keep the office furniture used by his predecessor in the oval office, including the office desk and area rug.

A gift from Queen Victoria to President Hayes in 1880, the beautiful office desk has been used by almost every president since."

Who cares?|`|I71WIC0paa	The Japanese do not hate American in any way shape or form for the most part. However there is a group of people in Japan who disagree with the United States' position on nuclear weapons and power. Obviously, this is because of the Nuclear attacks that occurred in Hiroshima on august 6,1945 and Nagasaki on august 9, 1945. I remember there being a similar case a few months back when a US nuclear powered submarine docked in a Japanese port. Public opinion also has a lot to do with Japans pacifist constitution which was drafted at the end of WWII. It doesn't allow Japan to have a large organized army or navy, nor does it allow them to wage war on another country only defend their own. Thus the name Japanese Self Defense Force(JSDF). This is why America stations such a large amount of soldiers in Japan at any given time. Despite Japans anti-nuclear views, they have extremely good relations with the American government and it's citizens. If anything most Japanese people actually love Americans.    Oh and "proudamerican" think before you make a comment. Calling the country with the second largest economy in the world as irrelevant as Switzerland(Switzerland isn't irrelevant in the first place) is an extremely ignorant and untrue statement.|`|SWxcuGlOaa	No they just don't want warships in their docks, foreign ones    O ya their is the small problem of that being the site where some of their grandparents were blown up because of the US.    ______________________________________...

There is a US Naval base in Japan waters, so why now all of a sudden this public attention?     Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, which then brought on the Atomic Bomb.

Find out what the strengths, weaknesses of the case are (for both sides) and what the attorney believes the likely outcome of a trial would be.  Depending on what your nephew did....it may not be possible for him to avoid prison and getting some kind of a deal may be his best option.     As for getting money....sell a car or two. Take a loan against a life insurance policy or 401k. Take a cash advance against a credit card.  Have the family pitch in together for the cost or get a loan from a family member. In the current credit crunch...not many banks are going to do an unsecured loan for 20K.  The days of easy credit are over.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	> Any ideas on where he could get an unsecured loan at a reasonable interest rate?     Maybe those "older kids doing stupid stuff" can hook him up.    > finding a pro bono attorney that might take the case,    why would anyone do that? what is so special about this case? any interesting principle of law? Or just that someone should work for years for a demanding client and a guy who, I know he is your brother, but still, is not a good father or this would not have happened, all at the lawyer's expense?    Would you do it? How much do you work for free for random people doing what you do in your regular job? Not at all I bet unless there is something else in it for you - maybe a bit just to be a nice guy, but that is all, right? Why would a random attorney be different? they have bills to pay too.    > better yet any ideas on what to do about the current attorney not working    Maybe stalling a case until witnesses forget or go away and can't be found or until the defendant turns 18 or a million other things are viable legal strategies that may be working if your brother would simply ask instead of acting out, especially since:    > the offer from the DA stands the same as it was when my nephew had the public defender on the case.    So it appears that the DA is confident in the case, and so your nephew's attorney is probably wise to stall and not be in a rush to trial. What you see as "stupid stuff" may not be seen that way by the Court, which I think you already know.    Maybe a sincere meeting with the current attorney is called for - he works for your nephew and/or brother, so there is no reason not to express concerns frankly - they are all on the same team, and the client is in charge. The client should do what then need to to understand the strategy as much as possible.|`|ygccpU2paa	First off, you can't find a pro bono lawyer if you have enough money to pay $20K to the first attorney.  Your brother is SOL on that one.    If your brother truly believes the lawyer has done something wrong, been neglectful of the case or whatever, he can complain to the local bar association.  Maybe he should threaten to do so first and see if this lights a fire under the attorney.    Based on people I know, at least in Florida, minors who get into trouble generally aren't given much more punishment than probation and community service and perhaps a court-run diversion program.  Being that he's underage, he won't have a real "record" from this mistake.
C7wjR42Daa	You need to do your studies first. Once you qualify you apply to OCS and when there you request the LAW option. You have a ground, air, and law option to choose from.    And then you go from there. Be in shape and have a clean background.    Here are some links for the officer programs.  http://www.thefirst2fight.com/t498/    You must be bar certified to apply to the LAW option..
AA11494150	You will start out the same rank, although some departments put you in a higher pay grade. Madison, WI PD gives you an extra 18% for a four year degree.     Many departments require a bachelors degree for promotion above the rank of Sergeant. The Masters degree will probably not be a major advantage until you start looking at higher management positions.|`|B07sKfdvaa	I hope that experience matters more than book smarts in any police department!|`|DTNlqnOEaa	Having a University graduate degree is useless if you are not "street wise " and able to deal with quickly changing situations.    Formal education is a good thing, but in many cases the well  educated new police officer will be handicapped by their lack of actual "life experience " and not having  developed the wide view that is needed to grasp the events that they are a part of.     Being " promotable " is not just a matter of flashing your degree. You also have to have been a dependable and hard working officer, who has the trust and  respect of the other members of his/her shift/platoon.  Your supervisor's monthly  reports on you,  and your record of  past good work will be at least half of the deciding factor in your being promoted. A further factor will be the "needs of the department  " at that time. You may be a suitable candidate for promotion, but  if there are no openings,  you will have to wait. Budget will also come into it.    Jim B. Toronto.
g2R7e2eVaa	1. Dogs fit into the criminal justice system in many ways. There are drug dogs, tracking dogs, and attack dogs.     2. Corrections departments use dogs for the main purpose of drug sniffing. They are also a tool used to combat riot situations.     3. State, Local and Federal law enforcement and corrections agencies use dogs.    4. No special licensing is required by the K-9 officers themselves. They have to be trained with the dog in their specialized field. In other words, if you want to be a drug enforcement agent, you have to go to drug recognition school with your dog.    That would depend on where you live. Some states are higher than others. The big pay is usually found in larger metro areas, but so is the responsibility. I would say for smaller areas 12 bucks and hour and for larger areas 18 bucks an hour are good starting pay estimates.

DTSUJe2oaa	There are really two types of common law marriages. The "traditional" common law marriage is one which is entered into without formalities. This type of marriage is usually defined as the intent to be married combined with living together and holding one's self out to the world as married. States which recognize the "traditional" form of common law marriage include (as of 1998) Alabama, Colorado, District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho (only if before 1-1-96), Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Ohio (only if before 10-10-91), Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas.~|`|kxU0gpdAaa	I've seen it considered after 24 hrs but its as simple as having 1 piece of your mail being delivered to your partners house.

So, you could save some money if you just get married in Canada and then apply for a standard immigrant visa petition.

Public administration is the ins and outs of running a city, township, or county: things like budgetting, fixing and maintaining water & sewer system, repairing the roads and highways, fixing bridges, keeping the lights on, the streets clean, and the trash picked up, (and how to coordinate it all without losing your mind).    Political science is the study of broad themes and ideas that shaped a system of thinking.    Each is a good field.  It just depends on what you want to do at the end of your preparation.

Contact the Clerk of Courts, give them the case number. If you can't get anywhere with them, the DA's office should be able to tell you what happened and why.

AA10783710	You really can't win an insurgency war for someone else, because there will always be locals who consider you an invader, not a stabilizer nor a liberator (we liberated the Iraqis from the Butcher of Baghdad, Saddam Hussein, but the terrorists are Islama-fascists who want no part of democracy because it is not compatible with Sharia law, and the kind of society they want.    The terrorists are most certainly not "insurgents".  An insurgent is someone who fights against a foreign power, an invader.  The terrorists are fighting against their own democratically-elected government.  Hence, they are by mere definition, traitors, and should be summarily hanged.    To clarify this point, keep in mind the Iraqi government is autonomous.  We cannot tell them what to do.  They wrote their own Constitution, created their own system of government, and the people elected their own leaders.  Hence, the Iraqi government is completely legitimate.  They are in no way a puppet government of the U.S.  To show you how (exasperatingly) independent they are, they refused to allow the Blackwater Security Co. the necessary legal leeway to fulfill their mandate.  The company provides a wide range of very specialized international services including risk management, intelligence gathering, vulnerability assessments and high-risk security related solutions.      All of this means they really are engaged in very dangerous work, which can not possibly succeed if it is forced to follow civilian rules.  But the Iraqi government said it would not give them any concessions because they felt it would impinge on their autonomy.  So here they are trying to get rid of the bad guys, and the ungrateful Iraqi government makes their task impossible.    Well, we are winning the war in Iraq.  It's a slow process.  People are still getting acclimated to democracy, but violence is way down.  The government is getting stronger, and every month the Iraqi military and the Iraqi police force get a little better trained, a little more capable, and hence take on additional duties, freeing U.S. soldiers from bearing the brunt of the work.    The smaller the U.S. presence, the harder it is for the terrorists to claim they are fighting an occupying army.    And that's the irony of all this.  We'd love to leave, but the Iraqis are dreadfully slow in getting their act together.  Sure, they have a tough job.  For example, the army and police force have both been infiltrated by terrorists, so they never know when one of them is going to blow himself (and his comrades) up.    Has anyone ever won an insurgency war?  Sure.  The Romans repeatedly battered down a host of people who defied them.  The Germans were never really greatly affected by French resistance in WWII.  The U.S. won its independence from Britain.    The reason the Iraq war has dragged on so long is that we pursued the soft "hearts and minds" strategy, which takes a long time.  Middle Eastern mentality is peculiar.  They will normally just side with whomever they think will win.  That is who gets their support and allegiance.  If we had shown a more united front, instead of allowing that idiot Harry Reid to comment that "the war is lost", we'd have far fewer problems.  Even our allies worry that we'll lose our resolve and withdraw.  Heck during the first Iraq war (the Gulf War) British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had to chastise George H.W. Bush Sr. by saying, "Now, don't go all wobbly on us, George."    There is another way to resolve the insurgency problem.  The Germans in WWII were absolutely ruthless.  They responded to everything with almost comically disproportionate force.    In 1942, Czech patriots asassinated Reinhard Heydrich, the second in command of the German security apparatus, the SS.   Thousands of Jews and others were killed across Europe in reprisal. As a further reprisal for the killing of Heydrich, Hitler ordered the small Czech mining village of Lidice to be liquidated on the charge that it had aided the assassins.     In one of the most infamous single acts of World War Two (I once saw a movie about this), all 172 men and boys over age 16 in the village were shot on June 10, 1942, while the women were deported to Ravensbrck concentration camp where most died. Ninety young children were sent to the concentration camp at Gneisenau.    The village of Lidice was then destroyed building by building with explosives, then completely leveled until not a trace remained, with grain being planted over the flattened soil. The name "Lidice" was then removed from all German maps.     So THAT !!!.... was the German response.  Guess how many other acts of defiance the Czechs engaged in?    Well, zero is almost the correct answer.  In another comically disproportionate response, the Germans responded to Czech students calls for more academic freedom at the University in Prague thusly:  they rounded up the entire Student Council, shot the leaders dead, and then sent the rest off to concentration camps.    Now you're guessing right.... there were NO additional acts of defiance by the Czechs.    So if you want to know how to squash the insurgency, that's the blueprint.|`|BMArzuJUaa	We are winning the war in iraq you win an insurgency war by winning the hearts and minds of the people so they will root out and go against the terroists. That's what happened in iraq look up the anbar awakening.|`|SU8Dv2ZAaa	The Revolution wasn't really an insurgency at all, using guerrilla warfare tactics some of the time doesn't relate to fighting an insurgency.|`|1AwB73H5aa	Britain lost by following the old doctrine, brutal/savage/ruthless executions, burning down towns and families, and various other barbaric behavior    it turned uninterested colonists against them    We won in iraq because we were fair and friendly to the innocents, we gave them security round the clock, respected their ways, and help give them jobs    it made them turn against the foreign insurgents who were even MORE brutal to them, than the british were to us    that said, i agree with DC, our tactics were often guerilla warfare    but it was very OPEN warfare the entire duration    it wasn't in the way of insurgencies like in Iraq or in the Soviet block countries, or conquered France|`|pwdv08hVaa	DC said it perfectly

EVERYONE deserves their first breath. EVERYONE deserves a chance at life.  and "it's not my choice to make for other women" is THE stupidest thing i've EVER heard. we say "no murder" no one says "oh, it's not my place to tell that serial killer he can't kill people"  it's WEAK and a stupid argument that's only purpose is to beat around the bush so you can turn your head while something that is WRONG on SOO many levels is going on right before your eyes!|`|CdBdP2ymaa	Its murder...get over it!|`|VDgLVHtGaa	I'm for abortion on demand.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	An unfortunate need in society.

I personally chose not to have an abotion but I dont force my views/ opinions on someone else. I dont know the reasoms why someone would choose to have an abortion and I should not. Not my life so not my decision.|`|KGppArcfaa	I had an abortion 6 years ago. I wont lie, i was irresponsible. Before I had, i was fine with abortion. I also thought it was a womans choice.  I think 100% differently now.  See, I think that a lot of people who are pro-choice, aren't realizing what is really happening.  Everyone told me its just a bunch of cells, its nothing. I was 12 weeks 5 days.  I now have a 2 year old. Having gone through a pregnancy, i know what I did was murder.   I can understand why a woman would get one if she was raped, but we have plan B now, theres no reason to get pregnant from rape anymore.    I have nightmares of the abortion on a weekly basis. Not just nightmares about remembering the other women there, or the doctor telling me to keep my bum over the cup, or the nurse holding my shoulders down. I physically feel it everytime I remember. I feel my insides being scraped. I have no doubt I will remember this forever, and I deserve it.  I dont remeber any of the pain giving birth to my beautiful baby. I find that weird, as they are both a similar pain, but the positive one I cant remember.    No one ever regrets having a baby. But most people regret an abortion.    I would never have an abortion again. Even if I was raped.     I am so sorry for what I did. Its because of my experience that i am Anti-Abortion. I am not anti-choice. I cannot judge any woman who gets one. I just wish that at the very least, abortion would be limited to 12 weeks gestation or less. There needs to be more regulation.    Sorry for the long answer.

Maybe try to get into special operations such as rangers in the Army or Force Recon in the Marines. Be the best and apply for sniper school.     That path will limit what civilian occupations you might be good for but will be good training for law enforcement. The leadership skills may help in you in many jobs but chances are that someone with that type of background is an adrenaline junkie and only like working certain types of jobs.|`|m9mJfUARaa	Your best choice is to get through high school and graduate.

zH0h0Tr0aa	The United States Constitution divides the foreign policy powers between the President and Congress so that both share in the making of foreign policy. The executive and legislative branches each play important roles that are different but that often overlap. Both branches have continuing opportunities to initiate and change foreign policy, and the interaction between them continues indefinitely throughout the life of a policy.    This report identifies and illustrates 12 basic ways to make U.S. foreign policy. The President or the executive branch can make foreign policy through:    1) -- responses to foreign events  2) -- proposals for legislation  3) -- negotiation of international agreements  4) -- policy statements  5) -- policy implementation  6) -- independent action.!~!

I think it is one of the most toughest school, if not the hardest school. you also have to be prepared mentally and get a pretty high score. also Ranger School students will participate in three airborne, and several air assault operations throughout the duration of the course, relying on C-130 Hercules cargo planes, as well as UH-60 Black Hawk and CH-47 Chinook helicopters, for insertion and extraction|`|3xTNOevjaa	I'd Recommand the Marines.

Benefits such as faster promotion, you will get more training as a ranger, and there are more jobs if you decided to transfer to a new mos later.|`|0szdPqI0aa	Army rangers are not even in the same league as marines. marines are way down their.  not saying their weak, but they are not better than regular army infantry either.    army infantry are both trained great. marines do take part in more attack objectives, but the army infantry has its share of great take over combat missions as well.  so do not think being a marine is one step away from a ranger, because being a marine is like 7 steps away from being a ranger.    what i say is, join army infantry, and try to get into an airborne unit. ( airborne units are highly deployed, and they see as much as marines).  you will get a feel for infantry, jumping from planes via static line, and some combat i am sure. then when you think your ready, you can apply for Ranger indoc.     or you can join the marines, and never have a chance of becoming a ranger, unless you join, then get out, then join the army. (which is a little hassle from switching branches).|`|RTxFNURzaa	Your not guarenteed to become a ranger there special ops i would say go for rangers though great expirience my cousin is a ranger and i hope to be one day my cousin wouldn't stop being a ranger if it killed him.

367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	First things first. To change your rate (job) after your in the NAVY you do not have to retake the ASVAB. You talk with your career counselor and put in a package to change rates. You will need to meet certain requirements and must not be in a critical rating.    Now on to the BM (boatswain mate). The BM is the job that is the U.S. Navy. You will be responsible for ship upkeep, loading stores, painting, being a Coxswain and a multitude of different jobs. It can be a very difficult and tedious position but one that is very rewarding. I enlisted in the Navy as a Master at Arms but I was originally going to go in as a BM because you will learn everything there is to know about ships and being a Sailor. I'm sure you'll do fine and actually like doing BM work after you get the chance to do it.    Here's some links to help you out:  www.bluejacket.com/usn_ratings.html  www.boatswainsmate.net  www.navygirl.org    Good luck and hope this helps.|`|ubrYk78waa	I am talking from about 50 years ago. Boatswain was the hardest rate to make rank in as there were so many. You had to be really top notch. You will learn how to take care of the ship. Chip off old paint and replace it with new paint. You will learn how to keep the ship clean, ever heard of swabbing the decks. You will learn everything there is about lines and knots. Once you make E-4 and above you will be king of the ship, a leading PO of a ships deck division.|`|uurgL3oZaa	It's a tough job, and you'll be doing a lot of crap details until you make E-4. You will learn how to tie cool knots, paint, handle lines and run all sorts of pneumatic tools. It's a being a sailor with a capital S. It's one of the two original rates the navy came up with. Every BM I met was pretty hard core about their job. Most were pretty good at yelling. They all took a lot of pride in their rate.    It's a lot of hard work, but you're kind of the heart and soul of the ship.
8ca8f71ab3100f4960301f847cbf5954aa	Yes.    You can file a motion with the court where the order was issued, requesting relief.    Relief can constitute a fine, imprisonment, changing the terms of any divorce agreement associated with the cease and desist order, or another remedy you suggest to the court, and of which the court approves.  Contact an attorney for details for where you live and your particular situation.    Also, if you have a copy, look at the original cease and desist order, it may lay out the legal consequences for violating it.    Please note that a cease and desist letter is not the same as an order.  If the court issued it, it is an order, if your (or his) lawyer wrote it, it's a letter.  A letter has no legal force, an order has full force of law.|`|T0pkW783aa	Of course!  Contact your lawyer and bring the proof to him.

You would attend basic training between your junior and senior year and if you had a lengthy AIT you would attend that after graduation. I believe this was under the reserves program and you would drill during your senior year in high school. Maybe they don't have this program anymore, but you can always check with a military recruiter. One advantage is that you could go active duty after you graduated and already have completed your basic training plus had put some time in to gain some rank.|`|9rhmeb7raa	They will say finish school.|`|rNXCnJ8Eaa	I had a friend that didn't want to finish her senior year so she legally "dropped out" but received her GED in a matter of weeks, thus skipping her senior year.    She didn't use it to join the military, but she did manage to get out of high school earlier than most.    I don't like the term "drop out" for this circumstance but if you "drop out" and receive a GED, and then get your parents or guardians to sign permission forms to let you go then you're fine.    Otherwise, it would probably just be easier to finish school.    Which branch are you looking to join?|`|hJNwAHccaa	You can get a GED but the only service who will take you guaranteed is the Army.  Most other branches require a waiver or will not let you in at all.  If you want to join at 17, you have to have parental consent.  You can join the National Guard and do the split option where you go to Basic Training after your Junior year and then AIT after your Senior year.  A high school diploma is better anyways.  If you get a GED, you are required to score 50 on your ASVAB vs if you had a high school diploma.  As an Eagle Scout, I can't remember if they will put you in as a E-3 or E-4...I think E-3.      Seriously...either do the split opt (You can always go Active Duty whenever you want) or finish out high school and get your diploma.
tqD9xUpYaa	OK, so you're a witness and don't need or want to bring anything other than your memory...this assumes you were an eye witness and not some sort of expert witness!  Your description implies you're an eye witness.  So no exhibits from you.    As far as seeing the black ice, yes, it's possible to see it but the problem is that most drivers don't see it until they're on it.  Thus the loss of control and accident.  That's also why we often cautioned to be on the look out for black ice when the conditions warrant it.  The police officer/detective was looking for black ice and any other road conditions that could have contributed to the accident.  You just honestly answered the question that no, you didn't see it.
AA12109395	The only question that you and others should be asking yourself is " what is in the best interest of your Grandmother." Apparently' at some point in the past, your Grandmother thought that your Aunt would act in her best interest. Your post suggest that either she did not make a competent decision, her judgement was in question, your Aunt hijacked the process, or the situation has changed so drastically, that you now need to challenge the Power of Attorney.    Based on the info in your post, You, your Mom, and other siblings are long overdue for challenging the Power of Attorney.     Four things in your post stand out as things that a judge would consider as reasons to change the Power of Attorney.     Her inability to function on her own  Her personal safety  Severity of her medical condition  Her bills not being paid    The fact that your Aunt seems to be ignoring the things above would suggest that she is not acting in your Grandmother's best interest. By accepting that Power of Attorney, she basically acknowledged that she would act in your Grandmother's best interest and clearly, she is not doing so.    Thie issues affecting your Aunt and Uncle should have no affect or bearing with your Aunt exercising her responsibility for taking care of your Grandmother and under no circumstances should your Grandmother's assets be used for those purposes.

This puts Obama one vote closer to not even needing to pretend to be a bipartisan.|`|7ce892cc4050e10ec9ceecb9421c3efdaa	Probably.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	no, it was so as to suck republicans in by thinking that he has reached across the isle. anyway, it keeps gregg from being a thorn in his side as a senator 'cause he can fire him any time he wants|`|ACpCb1aUaa	Yes That's why the Dem's want more taxes because they don't pay theirs.|`|B07sKfdvaa	No...it seems like a thinly veiled attempt to have a liberal take his place, so that they could move closer to a filibuster-proof senate.|`|nJSVwAxMaa	its not obama's ***** fault these retards don't pay their taxes|`|JDRj44xMaa	I don't trust ANY politicians anymore TBH.|`|cIH0QbfMaa	No, Obama did it so that Gregg can be replaced with a Democrat and Al "Stuart Smalley" Franken can be sworn in as the 60th Senator on his side. Why do you think Obama stood by Lieberman when the others wanted to drum him out of the caucus? Because Chicago politicians get things done, and now Lieberman is the President's *****.|`|IsGo50kqaa	No; he wants a filibuster-proof Congress.|`|nHD8nQTRaa	lol.  wait a second, do they pay taxes on welfare?

But what they will do is wreck things all around.  This is why a Flat Tax is fair.    Now for those who love to stereotype the Republicans, don't forget your own Racists on the Left, such as Robert Byrd, or Kamau Kambon, the Professor who wants to exterminate white people.    The left has it's heroes through out history.  Margaret Sanger, founder of planned parenthood, not just an atheist, but an anti-Christian, not just a communist but an anti-capatalist and also a racists who wanted the Black Community to abort itself out of existence.

The troll posts a message, often in response to an honest question, that is intended to upset, disrupt or simply insult the group.    Usually, it will fail, as the troll rarely bothers to match the tone or style of the group, and usually its ignorance shows.    Why do trolls do it?  I believe that most trolls are sad people, living their lonely lives vicariously through those they see as strong and successful.    Disrupting a stable newsgroup gives the illusion of power, just as for a few, stalking a strong person allows them to think they are strong, too.     For trolls, any response is 'recognition'; they are unable to distinguish between irritation and admiration; their ego grows directly in proportion to the response, regardless of the form or content of that response.    Trolls, rather surprisingly, dispute this, claiming that it's a game or joke; this merely confirms the diagnosis; how sad do you have to be to find such mind-numbingly trivial timewasting to be funny?    Remember that trolls are cowards; they'll usually post just enough to get an argument going, then sit back and count the responses (Yes, that's what they do!).|`|MUcINsQ3aa	They do as their parents and their government teach them to do.|`|2f2A2Lz3aa	Of course Lib policy is built on hypocrisy and lies !!

Complaining that he inherited the debt. Well, Obama. You knew, when you were running that the debt and the economic process was a huge problem. Now is not the time to complain, it is time to go out and do something about it in a bipartisan manner. If you can't handle it, then you should have stepped down.    You already have the Democrat's vote, so why are you at their retreat talking badly about Republicans for not supporting your bill of pork barrel that will not stimulate the economy in the way he intends it to. If anything, you should be appealing to the Republicans. Obama clearly alluded to Republicans being replaceable, selfish, and he lost every single Republican vote because of that. Obama clearly created a great division in political parties that has not been so great for decades.     Furthermore, Obama. Do NOT complain. Do not  complain about how hard you are working, about how tired you are. That you never get to see your kids. That the Dems are working so hard, implying the Republicans are only complicating the issue. You are arrogant for doing so and saying so, and if you can't handle 17 days of the Presidency, then I sure as heck do not want to hear you for the next 4 years. Please step down now if you are only going to complain. When running, you knew what you were getting yourself into, and already, on the 17th day you can't take it and complain.     He divided political parties so much by this speech, and took an enormous step to the left.

When we talk about places like the Middle East specifically, we're talking about people who execute homosexuals, treat women like second class citizens and see martyrdom as an opportunity.  May pulling the military out and lessening our commercial impact on that part of the world help?  Maybe a little, but you're lying to yourself if you think that it'll quell any hatred and create a unity between nations.  They're hellbent on making the world an Islamic Theocracy in some branches of Islam, and they have the loudest voices.    On top of that, while I can see how McDonald's, Coke and other forms of Western commercialism would make people think that the rest of the world is tired of us (I'm tired of us), we also have to understand that we're the freest nation in the world (believe it or not) and have an obligation to spread that freedom throughout humanity.  Religion, geography or government should not be allowed to determine your amount of freedom, especially when it subverts humanity itself.  Isolationism is worse than ignorance.|`|sGpEe35Haa	Help Lord!!! You need your meds. Peace|`|BUGuJIk9aa	You make a very good point. I think a lot of terrorism occurring in the world has got a lot to the US. The Middle East is a very good, the imperial wishes of the US has just caused more death and destruction. if the US never got involved in other countries business, if they did not install, support and fund puppet dictators then there wouldn't be such hatred for the US.
8OaAmwq8aa	Your privilege is based on the necessity of other people in the world. Most countries in the world are capitalist countries, which is why 30 percent of the world population controls 90 percent of the riches, and why multi-billion companies earn more than some countries. Do all those statistics scare you? Well they should. Now, lets look at socialism. Socialism is basically imperfect communism, where everyone is equal and fair. Is it a bad idea that people who study for eight years in post-secondary school earns the same as people who work at a food distribution center (in an assumed communist country, grocery stores and such do not exist since everything is free), some people say that is unfair, I say it is fair.     People who studied for eight years will be capable of working in a better environment than that of a distribution center. And if you look at it this way, it may be more convincing. Canada is a mixed economy, where health care services are provided by the government, and this is a step towards socialism compared to our neighbours down south. But how about we take it one step further?    Free food for everyone? You may argue that people will start to hoard food supplies, but the truth is, no. People are greedy because of their survival instincts, and therefore it is conditional. When survival is garanteed, people will become tolerant and not greedy, for all you religious people, isn't greed one of the deadliest sins?    Exactly, communism is a step towards perfection, or God. For all you athiests, when people are not greedy and are not worrying about money, the living conditions of people will increase substantially, now does that sound so bad? I don't think so. The problem with people, is that they tend to relate communism to monarchy, the truth is it doesn't have to be that way. Socialism or communism contracts capitalism, while democracy contracts republican.     What does it mean? It means we can be a democracy as well as communism, a multi-partied democratic country that has a communist economy. Do you want to see other people suffer and find in the depth of you conscience that you are the one causing the problem? You are essentially the one who switched on the big engine of capitalism that runs on other people's misery. Just want to give you something to think about, that's all.|`|jtDChHNwaa	Its a label that the mad republicans are throwing out there, we're not becoming a socialist Country.

Let's also consider the purpose of their job vs. that of a janitor. If I'm a Janitor I'm not going to complain about making less than a doctor. If you do then God help you.|`|CmCrEf5Oaa	Socialism tends to not work.   Furthermore, where is the motivation to go out and work harder if wealth is shared?  A doctor must go through years of schooling in order to get paid the big bucks. He works hard, and deserves to be rewarded for all the hard work that he/she has put in. (Plus, they have to pay off school debts)    Now where is the motivation to go out and be a doctor if you can get the same benefits by dropping out for high school and becomming a janitor? Why would you go through years of schooling to end up at the same level as a janitor, who normally didn't work too hard to get to the social standing he was at.   (I am not bashing janitors, I do appreciate their work, but this theory holds true.)|`|a405fe6055a8e90eb60d333024ff3097aa	Socialism sounds good in theory.   I have some recommended reading for you.  It is a book my son read called " The Giver"  The book illustrates the idea of socialism.    Capitalism is based on you get what you earn.   Socialism is: the government decides who gets what. He who makes more gives to the underachievers...kinda like leveling the playing field.    Socialism is a failed idea.|`|ZU5F9SBFaa	It gives your govt control .  Example if you have a serious medical need do you really want your govt deciding if you are a good candidate to receive treatment.|`|L6E6lDGKaa	A guy sweeping floors who decided he didn't want to put in the effort or pay the cost of extended years in school should not get pay equal to doctors. Why would anyone want to be a doctor if that was the case. This system rewards the effort. But judging by what we're witnessing in our economy, nothing is a guarantee. Many highly educated people are in unemployment lines. The irony is the janitors are probably still working. There can be an upside to lower wages.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yes, if decide not to get an education and work hard, then you will have to live a lesser lifestyle.  If you expect one half of the population to support the other half, you take away all incentive and then no one wants to be the ones working hard.    The only ones I see for socialism are those with no motivation, who are quick to blame society for their own failures.|`|PlAS9jJSaa	anyone can become a doctor.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	People should be rewarded by how hard they work.  This fosters ingenuity and creativeness.  Socialism spreads the wealth and takes away any incentive to do better.|`|AA11313983	For starters, socialism removes any and all competition.  That's bad, because prices can then go up as high as the government wants them to.    It also creates slums, because people don't have the option to move freely, so the landlord doesn't need to take care of them.|`|SGyRIjCIaa	Hard work should be rewarded. Doctors go through years of education that they pay for to become doctors. A janitor just becomes a janitor.     Let me explain in terms that someone your age can understand. Here is a story that people use to explain what is so bad about socialism..    A young woman was about to finish her last year of college.  Like so many others her age she considered herself to be a very liberal Democrat and was for distribution of all wealth.  She felt deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch Libertarian, which she expressed openly.    One day she was challenging her father on his beliefs and his opposition to higher taxes on the rich & the addition of more government welfare programs.  Based on the lectures that she had participated in and the occasional chat with a professor she felt that for years her father had obviously harbored an evil, even selfish desire to keep what he thought should be his.  The self-professed objectivity proclaimed by her professors had to be the truth and she indicated so to her father.    He stopped her and asked her point blank, how she was doing in school.  She answered rather haughtily that she had a 4.0 GPA, and let him know that it was tough to maintain.  That she studied all the time, never had time to go out and party like other people she knew.  She didn't even have time for a boyfriend and didn't really have many college friends because of spending all her time studying.  That she was taking a more difficult curriculum.    Her father listened and then asked, "How is your good friend Mary doing?"  She replied, "Mary is barely getting by."  She continued, "She barely has a 2.0 GPA," adding, "and all she takes are easy classes and she never studies.  But Mary is so very popular on campus, college for her is a blast, she goes to all the parties all the time and very often doesn't even show up for classes because she is too hung over."    Her father then asked his daughter, "Why don't you go to the Dean's office and ask him to deduct a 1.0 off your 4.0 GPA and give it to your friend who only has a 2.0."  He continued, "That way you will both have a 3.0 GPA and certainly that would be a fair and equal distribution of GPA."    The daughter visibly shocked by her father's suggestion angrily fired back, "That wouldn't be fair!  I worked really hard for mine, I did without and Mary has done little or nothing, she played while I worked real hard!"    The father slowly smiled, winked and said, "Welcome to the Republican Party!"|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Learn your history.

Let's face it- our society is one that runs on greed and power- socialism effectively ends that.    Now- we as capitalists put reins on greed and ride it to new successes. If everyone got paid the same, there would be no motivation for many people to become doctors or other pursue high paying jobs. Companies try to make better products and beat their competition in order to get the most money- if this competition factor were removed, then advancement would become stagnant. Competing is how most of our technology is formed; car companies rival other car companies to make the most cost effective vehicle, for example.    Socialism would be appealing to the lower income people while upper income people would detest it- as it would effectively destroy the gap between rich and poor. That being said- it wouldn't be fair for a janitor to  receive 3 hours of instruction and get paid as much as a person that went to college for 8 -12 years.     We take our natural greed and turn it into something good.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	When you don't put limits on the rewards you can get for providing new and interesting goods and services for people, you get a lot of interesting goods and services.

It is a constant drum beat by those with monied interests because they want to control the company and take disproportionate amounts of income.    I work in an employee-owned company and I work harder and compete more because I know that the efforts will actually benefit me.  I don't have to wait for the dangling carrot of promotion to gain benefit from my hard work.    There is a significant difference between communism and socialism.  In communism, everyone works for the state.  In socialism, the workers receive the benefits of their labor.  So, doctors would get paid more and executive administrators (paper pushers) would probably get less.    EDIT: and by reading the posts on here, it is obvious that people don't understand what socialism is outside of totalitarianism regimes like the Soviets and China.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	Socialism can't work because then most people would not work hard to become more then the janitor.  Those people studying their butts off to be doctors should be paid because they studied their butts off and they continue to learn things to stay in their occupation.    There are forms of socialism that are good, like universal health care (if we can get it right), public education, and our infrastructure system.  However, going to heavy on the socialism will cause a breakdown in society.|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	Um the goverment will tell you what where and when.|`|25d19e0400f6baeb5bf385259aaee257aa	The primary problem with socialism is that it assumes that everybody in a society will work towards the common good for everybody.    The trouble is people come in all types....good...bad...indifferent. By that logic, only about 33% of the people will work towards the common good....the other 66% are bad or don't care. If most don't care then the idea is doomed.    Pretty simple.

He is seen as a soft touch by the world, the EU can boss him around economically, the UN can boss him around, Israel can boss him around, Russia and Iran can do whatever they want because they know Obama is a little girl. The day after Obama won the election the president of Russia announced that Russia will be placing missiles in Eastern Europe to counteract the US anti-missile defense system. (I know that Russia backpedaled on that now but that they were definitely testing Obama.) Obama's stimulus plan promoted US protectionism and the EU threatened Obama with a trade war, and now he has diluted the plan to be more free trade friendly, so as not to upset any "allies". It's okay when France and Germany have trade tariffs and protectionist laws, but the US has no right to do the same apparently.

Obama is old enough to remember the time of Carter.  I wonder if he was high during that time or something.  Everyone else who lived through it remember it quite well.    In the 1980, which was the last year of the Carter presidency, the lowest inflation rate was 12.52% which happened in December (after Reagan had been elected but before he took office). The average inflation rate for that year was 13.58%.  http://inflationdata.com/inflation/Infla...    The worst inflation we've had under Bush was this last July when inflation reached 5.60%.  http://inflationdata.com/inflation/Infla...    The cost of living adjustments (COLA) during the four year Carter administration ranged between 5.9% and 14.3%.  The cost of living adjustments (COLA) for January 2009 is 5.8%.  http://www.socialsecurity.gov/cola/autom...    When Carter took the presidency in 1976, interest rates were 6.75%. When Reagan took over four years later, the rate was 20.00%!  When Bush took over the presidency in 2001, the rate was 9.00%.

Alkn6IJYaa	It has to do with simple economic theory.    The theory suggests that lack of spending causes recessions, which we are in now, and we need to spend to increase output and employment. Read any intro book on economics.    Simplistic economic theory does not suggest the type of spending. Any spending will do, however, it should be geared to those who spend rather than save, or to projects that are 'shovel ready' and ready to implement right away.    If, at the same time, we could invest in research, science, health and education, so much the better.     Although people here say there is a lot of pork, the fact is there is little pork, and they simply don't understand the importance of the issues raised. For example, spending money on reducing communicable diseases such as aids they translate as 'reduce herpes', and so on, basically lying about the importance of the projects. Honeybee production is vital to our nation's agriculture and we desperately need to find a way to reduce the current reductions in the populations of honeybees. So too with global warming, energy conservation and the rest. The more you actually know about things, the more you realize we need help in these areas.     On the other there is some pork.

0db7dfe907b8101041f1b50d64e06e6baa	I believe the primary purpose of the 16th Amendment was to pay the interest to the Federal Reserve for creating federal reserve notes out of nothing.  As you state, the Constitution prevented any direct tax on the American people, requiring an amendment.    Most Americans today think we need the income tax to pay for government operations.  The fact is, only about one third of the federal government's revenue comes from the personal income tax.  If unconstitutional departments and agencies were abolished, there would be justifiable reason for a personal income tax.    But the real reason for the personal income tax in my opinion is to pay the interest on the inflation of our currency.  This interest on the treasury bills sold to the Federal Reserve by the Treasury provides billions of dollars annually to the bankers who control the Federal Reserve.  At the same time, these newly created federal reserve notes give our politicians additional revenue to finance their socialistic, vote buying schemes.    So, this unconstitutional, swindle of the American taxpayer has been going on for almost a hundred years.  The recent bail outs of corporate and banking interests demonstrate greed which is unsatisfied with the billions stolen by inflation.  These interests now demand outright gifts of the taxpayers money, or they threaten to shut down the economy.  And our criminal politicians are only too willing to comply.    So, we need to abolish the Federal Reserve, and repeal the 16th Amendment at the same time.  But doing this will require replacing almost the entire Congress, as most Representatives and Senators have sold their souls.  We need to replace almost all of these people with real Americans who will represent us, not the special interest.|`|AA11702773	Yes.    As far as I am concerned it is 'cover' to the printing of money by the fed, to give 'presumed legitimacy' to what is in essence a counterfeiting operation.  The government having a source of 'real money' is presumed to be spending something of value rather than drawing value from your money by printing more out of thin air.|`|J3IOlhd8aa	Yes it should. but then where would the dems get their votes|`|NZuJR79oaa	It should have never been created, but an instantaneous removal won't help.  It needs to be gradual.  The national bank has been killed before under Jackson.      It may have been passed for that, however it was one of many progressive amendments that were passed during the Wilson Administration.  He got us into Europe's War and then they gave women the right to vote (A good thing), Prohibition (A bad thing), and the Income tax. (A bad thing). The Income tax was made purely to be punitive to the higher earning people.  It was a tax only on people making hundreds of thousands of dollars, less than 1% of the population paid it. But, you give an inch....|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	The government does not pay interest to the Fed on the government debt that  they hold.  There is nothing in the Constitution that prohibit having a Central bank and  The First Bank of the United States was  chartered by the United States Congress  in 1791. It was later abolish because of political opposition,|`|3caq6SFxaa	I do not like taxes like everyone else but the 16th Amendment is necessary for various reasons as tariffs on import and export were one of the primary ways to raise money prior to that and the export taxes on raw material (cotton) is what actually led to the American Civil War (War of Northern Aggression).  With trade agreements and treaties it would be difficult to raise the export or import fees to fund the government as it exists and the average American would not like the higher prices on goods they would cause so it won't change.  I do think a fairer system, and much less complex, is needed and would prefer a flat tax instead of the current system which is so confusing even expert tax lawyers get confused by it and former Congressmen forget what they need to pay.  All said I think the government has gotten too involved in trying to buy votes and "happiness" but they have been successful so the people receiving that are not going to let it change; flat tax and no person gets more money back then they pay in would be fairer and disallow the wealth redistribution (vote buying) currently the rage.  Exclude money to a certain level, adjust it for inflation allow personal deductions on number of dependents and every thing is taxed at a flat rate above that. For Meg's thoughts that nothing in the Constitution forbids a central/national bank; the Constitution forbids some things to the various government levels but is primarily stating what the federal government is allowed to do.  It was writeen to set forth what the federal could do, what the state could do and was not designed to say everything else is allowed and in fact says all other powers are reserved to the state government.  The use of interstate trade to control things has gotten a little out of hand and that was one of the justifications used to establish the Federal Reserve.|`|4ojHnyZkaa	Yes, & Yes The Bank is bankrupt as well as the government of that money. The question is do we want the wolves that are running these institutions to do any more damage?|`|R7Hexutqaa	No.  The 16th amendment is legal, correct, constitutional and valid.  It did nothing more than establish a constitutional basis for a a necessary taxing authority.  That is all it is about - a taxing authority as by the early 20th century it was not possible to run the country on just the collection fines, fees and tariffs.      It has nothing to do with the federal reserve, and only to do with the funding of the necessary operation of government.    What this is really about is that you do not like to pay your taxes and you do not like how the government spends the taxes you pay.  There are two remedies for that:  Leave the country or work for change via the political process.  Trying to come in a back door that has never existed in the 95 years since the 13th amendment passed is just a waste of your time.
oMOiAFRBaa	During the primaries, I fought vigorously against those who would smear Obama's name by suggesting that he is somehow a terrorist sympathyzer.    Now I am starting to wonder if I had been wrong all along. WTF is going on?|`|IwBIM1tVaa	What do you expect from a terrorist sympathizer?|`|rNCGT1txaa	Drop charges against a known terrorist, and give them constitutional rights yet, give women the right to kill their innocent babies! It is disgusting!!|`|NqNbIp2caa	The guy will remain in prison and will face charges in the future.  No matter how much you guys pretend he is being freed the opposite is the case.  The difference is he will get a trial consistent with the laws and values that this country claims to uphold.  Why do you have so little faith in America and its justice system?|`|FSm4Us6Jaa	Was he proven guilty, or was he just a suspect? You have just appointed yourself, judge, jury, and executioner, how about that.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	Instead of listening to and reading foxnews, how about looking at all the articles out there. Al-Nashiri, the terrorist being tried for the USS Cole bombing, is still in jail and can be recharged and brought to a new trial.     These trials have been stopped so that the files of all the terrrorists can be reviewed to determine whether the evidence shows that they are actual terrorists or just someone who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.     How would you like it if your husband, wife, son or daughter were arrested and held for years without you knowing where or how they were, all because they had tried to protect you from a perceived threat? There were some prisoners who were released during the Bush Administration in which that was the case.
q1GnMRxxaa	We are getting them on the west coast too. I never saw anything like that before. After the election, you usually don't see anymore political commercials at all, so I don't get it, unless your right about the brain washing. I'd say, use the mute button and be on your toes to think for yourself instead of letting the media try to get to ya.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	If you watched less TV you wouldn't have to worry about it.|`|410cd3e1b1738d398d8b2183db222dc2aa	It disturbs me! He's just trying to brainwash people believing that he's so different from the other politicians. I'm sp sick of people coming up to me 'in awe" of him. And how "good they finally feel" about life since he was elected.  I feel good EVERY DAY I WAKE UP because of GOD! Not Obama!!    All the hype over him and this "deflating" plan aint working with me. I got faith the country will do better with LESS SPENDING.  The "economic collapse" was the fault of the Democrats-in-charge NOT regulating the housing market in the first place.|`|J3IOlhd8aa	the most commercials I see are selling Obama something, coins , plates, to the already gullible obamanites|`|mdHqr17kaa	I haven't had TV in like three years and when I read things like this I am glad    this echoes Dick Morris's ideas adopted by Bill Clinton of making decisions by monitoring opinion polls.  of course the next step is to influence the polls one way or another.  Morris came up with the "change" slogan for Odinga's Orange Party, before Obama used it.  opinion polls played a big role in that controversial election, our tax dollars at work to set up communists in pacts with sharia terrorists----nice    the people doing these ads learned from the personality cults of the 20th century, first hand|`|UuyCVr3Taa	Big Bro is watching.|`|U50orfPhaa	George Soro's pays for all that, the man is nuts, he's also responsible for that Al Franken voters fraud.   Soro's really wants a filabuster badly and will do anything to get what he wants, he is like the biggest spoiled brat in the world with the most money.|`|a375l0D7aa	It is disturbing yes. It is the continual build up of a personality cult worshiping a man who is a very good orator. Be afraid. Be very afraid.|`|09aGRz8paa	i haven't seen these commercials and if i did it wouldn't bother me.  i'd like to see less priceline commercials though.  they just get on my nerves.|`|QGBSOpt7aa	They need to do something to try and keep up his rating.  We all know it is dropping like the stock market.  I'm still waiting for all the BS promises that he made to start coming true.  Of course, it will probably be 3 1/2 years before they start|`|1ymL5LKlaa	Yes, it is disturbing.  I expect to receive a package of Obama flavored Kool-aid in the mail any day now.|`|DypTl9Zdaa	I have yet to see any of the commercials or ads you speak of here in Texas but if I did it would have most likely blown my mind.  I agree with you.  I think there is going to be a great deal of work in brain washing the American people.  Many of them already are.  I'm concerned about how uninformed the people really are.  Obama has disguised this huge amount of government spending by calling it a "stimulus" package.  Most followers just see $$$ coming to them and everything will be just fine.  What they don't understand or even try to understand is that this so called package is going to create a serious rise in inflation.  Not to mention most of it is in the way of pork.  What was it Obama said?  Distribution of wealth?  Well I hate to say but a large amount of this money is not going to the poor.      Anyway...change isn't really what we've seen so far.  I would encourage those who have gone ga ga over this man for whatever reason take a step back and reevaluate the situation.  It would be in your best interest.|`|j38mlGvZaa	I think it's nice for a country to actually support their leader, but hey, that's just me. It's not like he's a bad guy. In fact, he's actually a good guy contrary to conservative belief.|`|Ca8i226Xaa	Yes, they are disturbing, and they are nothing less than the left's attempt to brainwash us into senseless Obamabots. Obama must have studied the propaganda methods of the infamous Kim Jong Il of North Korea. I have joined the Resistance!|`|ODTe2l77aa	I like the idea of pro-Obama rather than anti-Republican commercials...    It's better than like, mudslinging, that we used to see during the elections.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	I am armed with a DVR and don't watch commercials.   Besides, I live in a very conservative community, thank God, and I doubt anyone would bother.  Basically, the only ones I have seen are ones that are shown on news programs to explain why they are on.   Keep them hypnotized as long as you can, I guess.|`|TKbYavhzaa	I agree, it's a little weird.  But presidents have been targeting the population directly (in order to pressure congress) for a long time.  Reagan's radio addresses are a prime example.      I just wish he wasn't spending all that money on it... surely there's something better to do with it.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	I am disturbed by everything about this man.  Have you seen the video Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher made with I don't know how many celebrities in it pledging their faith in Obama and vowing to follow him in all his decisions, it is the freakiest thing I have ever seen, people should be afraid, very afraid.|`|uxu8qJUYaa	The Obamanists, know that he will fail, and they are already trying to gear him up fo re-election in 2012.    And yes, it does bother me.|`|ZphAhwy6aa	Hey Dude Just shut up and Drink the Koolaid already :}|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Nope, love to see all this support for the President of the United States for a change.|`|AA10168935	It doesn't disturb me in the least.|`|m3jb9qjdaa	Wow!  You know, it makes sense. oblama will basically threaten anyone who disagrees with him that he will run a TV add making them look bad. This is unprecidented. Who has ever done that? This guy is a completely arrogant SOB. Bush had more class in his toe jam than oblama has. I doubt Bush ever even thought to do such a thing....or even clinton for that matter.  This can't be right. But I fully expect this will be true.
SS1VReF0aa	It creates temporary jobs...but that will not help    Take the dog park for example (yes there are funds in this bill to construct a dog park...)    Once that lovely dog park is built, the job is done. That dog park provides no more jobs at that point (maybe a maintenance job and a cleaner). More importantly, that dog park produces nothing! There is no value or product being produced. At that point it is just a big expense. That is not stimulus, that is waste. Then comes the bill that we have to pay back because this money is being borrowed...but nothing that was produced by this stimulus bill will help us to repay that debt being as it is all stuff that produces little or nothing of value. So we are worse off in 3-5 years than we are now! Creating jobs to just make stuff does not make sense. Much of the stuff in this bill is pork, nothing that produces anything of value.    Give the money back to us in taxes. I use the money to start a business or expand an existing business or hire a new employee. I then use that money to produce things that make me more money. Then as my business produces more and I sell more I expand further. See how that works? My money is used to produce things of value! Anyone know what that is called? That is called growth ladies and gentlemen. I wouldn't use that money to build a dog park because I'm not an idiot and I realize that a dog park won't give me a return and grow the economy.      Vance...are you paying attention? The Republicans in the House proposed a plan that would create twice as many jobs for half the cost to taxpayers....it's not like they are just saying "no" and not offering their own solutions, the Democrats aren't listening.|`|2YkEQrmvaa	No...especially when money is going to silly pet projects and liberal groups doing no REAL work.|`|2jSW9Asfaa	yes....    what is your alternate proposal? let the other 5 million projected jobs go this year?|`|kOsJ63KFaa	What jobs to do waht work? Are they going to hire all these out of work people to build things? It still takes skilled tradesmen to build structures. We are just going to give blueprints to t the out of work banker and Circuit Ciy salesman and let them build?|`|TPB7NjvIaa	In my opinion it will do little of either. But it will create trouble and plenty of it.|`|S6FLJ64Qaa	it doens't create anything accept bills.    What I find amazing is that the Dems don't need GNC support to pass this thing.  They have a majority.  They can do it alone.  However, they won't do it, because they know that this is a CRAPPY BILL.      Please notice that most of the payments do not begin until just before the next election cycle.  (Covert way of buying votes.)    Call your Senator and tell them to shoot this thing down.|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	No one on this site has any clue what the stimulus bill includes nor what the realistic affect on America will be.  All answers are mere biased rhetoric, not to be taken seriously.  You should have saved your 5 points for a worthwhile question.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	I think a very small part (infrastructure) will create some temporary jobs a few years down the road.

That's funny. Well what do I think? I think the US needs to get out of Iraq regroup and then kick Iran's head in, but that's just me.|`|Yzb44aV6aa	If they had a stable government and were given permission to do so by the international community, i would not have a problem with it.  They are a sovereign country.    On the other hand, we all need to get rid of that stuff.  Even if no one attacks on purpose, accidents do happen.|`|GE6vqqF8aa	Iran is a sovereign nation, but it leaves me concerned about power being in the wrong hands. However, I don't think the U.S. should rush to get involved right now. I would be willing to bet money that Israel isn't going to permit Iran to have "systems" in place but for a limited amount of time. Israel will take out a threat while the U.S. and other countries are living in denial and catering to the whims of the politically correct factions and the United Nations.|`|iTj5NdH1aa	There are people that simply should never be allowed to possess such things. Iran falls into that category very obviously.|`|cae374494bce57a22fef967ebfefc9fbaa	Iran is enemy of Israel , because they are Persian and they are anti Semite at first place so there are lying when they support Arabs or Palestinians because they are Semite too.   This kind of systems would help them to be more powerful and would like to destroy people which they don't like . Iran with these kind of technologies would be a big threat to the world peace which is vulnerable already. and help them to reach to their imperialistic objectives.

And the entitlement crowd n this country needs to be cut off too.  It is out of control.  Do you know that for the first time in history over 40 % of the people in this country pay ZERO taxes?    Criminal!
oMOiAFRBaa	I think after Obama sends our country's security and economy into a downward spiral, people will be longing for the Bush years.    Obama will go down in history as the best thing to ever happen to the Bush legacy, after being recognize as the one Black president who ruined every other black man or woman's chance of ever becoming the leader of anything.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I don't think anyone living or in the future will be able to forget the worst president in history!

Depends on how bad the economy is and how he treat our enemies abroad    If he sets up a trade barrier like he is hinting (this is what the UAW and other Unions want) then he will make UK and the Euro Community and of course all of Asia very mad at him and the US    So ask yourself  this!

5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	What HYPOCRITES.  The Democrats have been screaming their heads off for years about this kind of thing.  They're always ragging on corporate execs but they do this EVERY YEAR.  Can't believe they had the BALLS to do it this year in the MIDDLE of the battle of the "worst crisis since the Great Depression" as The One put it.  A fancy chartered private train from Washington to Williamsburg.  An exclusive resort with golf courses (weather in the 50s this weekend) and spa.  Fabulous meals at a selection of gourmet restaurants.  YOUR tax money!!!  Obama used Air Force One for the short trip to give a 20 minute political speech.  Hundreds of thousands of YOUR tax money.    The Senate had theirs last week at the posh Newseum - 3 blocks from the Capitol where they had dozens of FREE rooms to use.  Expensive room rent, fancy catered food by Wolgang Puck.  Your tax money.    Last week, Obama had a luncheon at the White House.  Wagyu beef steaks at $100 a pound.  He's just a regular guy, raised by a single mom.  A "community organizer."     Yeah, anybody tell these guys there's a recession going on???    And today, another Cabinet nominee has tax problems.  Labor Secretary-Designate Solis.  All for the "working folks," huh?    The Sunshine Foundation released a report showing that Democrat Cong, Charlie Rangel, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, responsible for WRITING the tax codes, has been filing improper tax returns for THIRTY years.    As Hotel Queen of Mean Leona Helmsley said, "Only little people pay their taxes."|`|AA10685723	No difference it's our money...the hypocrites|`|JthubNIsaa	Here's the difference - The republicans went on theirs last week and made the lobbyists pay for it.

If they did, they shouldn't be having any junkets.    Also Congress doesn't raise money by selling.  They get paid by taxpayer money.|`|odBWpML6aa	Two sides of the same coin.
DMmel4T6aa	Yes and no.  If you view "stimulus" as creating jobs and infusing money, then it is a stimulus package.  I do not.    My view is a little different.  Spending money for the sake of spending money is not effective long term.  I was an engineer on  few government projects.  One example, we built a hospital.  It was a 100 million dollar project.  It had 8000 changes to the contract documents. So you pay a team to design it but they do a crappy job.  Then you pay millions over the contract to fix it.  Where is the financial accountability?    A true stimulus for this economy would mean less government spending for the private sector(Amtrak, Hollywood producers, car makers, airlines....).  But it would include downsizing of government extras.  A project that is proven ineffective and or inefficient does not improve by throwing more money.   It improves by holding expectations and requirements.  I can't begin to explain how much this nation would be helped by a flat tax and extreme downsizing or elimination of the IRS.    People say that sounds like it would eliminate jobs.  Not if you made it affordable for private business to do business.  Not if the money that is spent by government was used to be productive and not wasteful.  We got here by over sized and wasteful government.  Why would we do the same thing to get out?|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Wow I have no idea...|`|BHBQPFzlaa	John you have no idea what you're talking about with that $4 Trillion/year  remark.    Even bush, the most irresponsible spender in the history of the white house, drove our national debt up by $5 trillion to a total of $11 trillion ($30k per citizen, roughly).    Why is it everyone complains about taxes going up, when he was spending your kids money and you didn't even notice?    I'm not sure people remember what pork really is. Public health, infrastructure, cars for federal employees, disease control, electricity generation are all worthwhile programs that we have to continually put money into in order to keep America running.|`|k6hicodfaa	Yes.  All that pork would involve hiring or continued employment of people.|`|NZuJR79oaa	Its Keynsian economics. Which declares that government spending money it doesn't have is the best thing for the economy.  Government spending is what keeps our economy down.  we are approaching $4 trillion a year.  Imagine If government ran on even $500 Billion, and the rest people had to do business.|`|AA10465540	It all sounds like job producing, income stimulating concepts.  I am skeptical about "paid volunteers", and the hybrid car thing will only help if the cars are manufactured in the U.S. using U.S. workers and materials.  While some aspects might be make work oriented, making work is an important part of stimulating the economy.|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	Yeah it is a party for all those who helped get President B.O. His job - Thank you all for playing pay to play|`|WD6uLJxvaa	WOW, there is more pork in there than I had originally thought - I wonder how many "paid volunteers" you can get with 160 million?|`|IM30PoPNaa	The Repubs are critical of a few billion out of $800 billion.  Big deal.    Many of those items are stimulus.  For example, $600 million to buy hybrid vehicles for federal employees.   $200 million in funding for the lease of alternative energy vehicles for use on military installations. That's money spent on American cars.  It'll stimulate jobs.    $1 billion for the 2010 Census.  $500 million for flood reduction projects on the Mississippi River.  $650 million for wildland fire management on forest service lands.  Jobs jobs jobs -- what's wrong with that?    $448 million for constructing the Department of Homeland Security headquarters. $500 million for building and repairing National Institutes of Health facilities in Bethesda, Maryland.  $412 million for CDC buildings and property. $6 billion to turn federal buildings into "green" buildings.  All these add up to jobs for construction workers.    $850 million for Amtrak.  $1.2 billion for "youth activities," including youth summer job programs.  $400 million for the Centers for Disease Control to screen and prevent STD's.  More jobs -- I don't see the problem.    I think most of these line items are fine.  They stimulate jobs, which is what the stimulus package is all about!!|`|vZZpPcDJaa	Those numbers are pathetic . Do you notice how much money they spend on things relating to the government and yet cost go down on projects concerning the general public ? And yet the general public is the one paying for it all  ? Thanks for driving home the already well known fact of what corrupt  politicians the American people voted into office. God bless.|`|XPSIn3wxaa	It is only going to help the people in Washington. All they know how to do is SPEND, SPEND, SPEND.    Well the country voted for these morons, I hope they are happy with what they get.    Don't blame me or the 56 Million other people who voted the other way.    What would be nice is if we could somehow make the people who voted for the tax and spend liberals were the only ones who had to write a check to cover the bills they produce. I bet things would change then... Now that is a change I COULD LIVE WITH.

The problem with liberals is that education is all they have.  That's why many stick around and become professors.  Other liberals remain poor because experience is everything in a sh*tty economy, and education doesn't mean a thing.|`|9a525103a8f9794c8bbbfec452cdfc7faa	The problem is that you expect the government to do everything for you.

Go to a third world country and see how much respect those kids have for what they have|`|m1HVh5YUaa	I agree that it is hypocritical, just as it is hypocritical that many, if not most people today calling themselves liberal do not support a free market, individual rights, private property, low taxes, and a small government, after all, the first liberals in America defined liberalism being directly associated with these concepts.    "Liber" comes from latin meaning "free", which is where the term "liberalis" or "liberty" came from. The early liberals based their philosophy on individual liberty. A "liberal" or "free" society, not a liberal government that passes laws and steals money on a whim.    Most of today's "liberals" consider humans to be failures that can not handle freedom. They do fail, and in some cases they are major failures and interference is required, but the petty crap that "liberal" politics is involved in today is nothing more than power grabs in the guise of "helping people". Why would they want to help people when they have no respect for them, only an induced pity so that they are convinced they have the right to infringe on other's individual rights.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	Dittoheads just won't get it.

Initially, Unions were good.  Now, they have caused businesses to close, inflation to rise, and every labor union company in America is going broke.  Even Hollywood asked for a bailout.  The Post office is broke.  Schools are broke.  Steel mills and airliners have left.  GM had to get a bailout.   Come on - Unions are breaking down Americas capitalistic society.    We now have labor laws.  Let's not let the mobsters run America.  The  unions are full of communists.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	There once was a time when Liberalism was an honorable thing.  But since the 1960's when the Baby Boomer Generation began to come of age, we have pushed Liberalism well beyond anything that could in any way be considered good for America.

But I drove friends for theirs - including one married friend that just couldn't see having a 3rd child as quickly as she became pregnant.|`|KGppArcfaa	Well I had one, and as much as im still pro-choice for others (as long as its before 12 weeks) it will never be an option for me again.

The plan is to first create a global catastrophe.  The next step is to fix the global catastophe he created.  Thirst step is to make people believe he really is the messiah and cause people to believe they do not need Jesus Christ since Obama is the messiah.

Maybe they really are fair & balanced, me thinks.|`|UvCA6ajZaa	You need other ways of getting your info.|`|qAL0CZIiaa	Fox isn't the Republican network.

AA11163314	Reference?    BTW - are you aware that this furniture would not just go to the DHS?    In addition it would go to:  The Coast Guard  Customs and Border Protection  the TSA  Citizenship and Immigration services  FEMA  the Secret Service  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  Federal Law Enforcement training center    So if you divide 248 million by 8 we get $31 million per agency.  (Even less when the DHS itself gets their share.)  Now lets assume that the government gets a really good deal and can get a complete set of office furniture for $1,500 per employee.  This means that each of these agencies can give just over 20,000 employees new furniture.|`|AA11702773	Homeland security should be abolished.  It was a 'do something' knee jerk response to 9/11 much the way the stimulus bill is to the economic crises.  We had tons of bureaucracy prior to that, just idiots interpreting information.  You can't cure stupid by throwing another agency on top of the idiots.
WoESqX8gaa	No I really doubt it.Too many people were looking at it as a Historic event.The media was on pins and needles to even question him,He really never answered any questions.|`|AA12229787	Obama would have immediately been forced to withdraw after the   showing of his racist preacher...|`|zEVpA4WCaa	IF HE WERE WHITE HE WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE BLACK VOTE, NOR THE LIBERAL VOTE, AND MOST LIKELY NONE OF THE DEM VOTES ,SO NO HE WOULD NOT HAVE WON.|`|AA11369432	It was he that won Not his color...remember all the other white men who ran from the Dem party.|`|r6JskEtxaa	Well a Democrat was going to win no matter what.|`|S6m6ymNvaa	I still would have voted for him. And so would some racist McCain supporters.|`|QziBNh0Uaa	Yes, I think so. His campaign was always one step ahead of the others. Once he beat Hillary in the Primary, I knew he was going to win.|`|w95ffy31aa	I doubt he would have won the nomination.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	Of course not.    The only reason he won was because whites felt guilty that so many black people are in prison - they think this will help balance things out|`|2LrQHVb3aa	Nope, he wouldn't have won the nomination.    Hillary probably would have won.|`|ucuP0boCaa	Yes,    Were he white Hillary would have quit sooner and McCain would have been beaten worse.    You must remember Mccain has a long history of incompetence.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	I think amy winehouse would have won if she ran as a democrat.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	Yes, and not only that, but by a much larger margin. )|`|B07sKfdvaa	Yes, as long as his political machine was working the way that it did.  Blacks are traditionally going to vote for a democrat anyway, so he didn't really steal that vote.  Anybody that the media created a similar "Cult of Personality" for would have taken the election.  Don't get me wrong, he ran the superior campaign, indicated by his 52% popular vote take in November.  He just played the American public in a way that discounts his skin color, and shows a master politician.  We can't begrudge him that!|`|pnpkJKvpaa	2008 called, it wants its tired old questions back.|`|Gv6UW2p2aa	You don't think he got elected based off his experience & character do you?    He's just a puppet boy for the liberals.|`|ejluOCdTaa	We will never know the answer|`|IwBIM1tVaa	Yes but he couldn't have won on the heels of anyone besides Bush.  After Bush a monkey could have won running as the democratic candidate.|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	He is white...half.     Yes...he would have won even if he was as white as Old man McCain.    I am white. I voted for Obama not because of color but because of Intelligence. I don't care how many lobbists he employs or how much he wants to spend, Obama is SMART. GW Bush was and is a white trash idiot. The people who supported Bush did so because they are even lower on the IQ scale than bush and therefore were not smart enough to understand just how stupid bush is.    White Americans are responsible for putting Obama in the White House...there is no way he could have won with only the minority vote. It was a landslide electoral college victory and if Obama was all white it would have been even more embarrassing for Repubs.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	Do you have any Idea how many times people have posted this question?|`|f2siAy0raa	no. the only reason he won was because of all that racial discrimination and stuff.|`|0pE3dhT8aa	90% of the newly registered black voters would not have even knew there was an election.

Race was the  1 deciding factor of this election IMO|`|QytEhdZUaa	Yes Hillary generated a climate anyone would have beat her and Bush gave the republicans a shame that they couldn't live down     George Hoover Bush should be his name|`|AA11600810	Perhaps, but I guess we'll never know will we?|`|bIaywrBCaa	I think so.

I think any democrat would have won against a republican.|`|lRmhwiYpaa	I think if he was like Bill Clinton~maybe Hilary would have won and she would have done things differently ~I am sure of that  I think it would have been a nicer time for the Democrats as Presidents has to face a angry country and a lot of people do not accept his  ideas or where he came from (dirty politics in Chicago)|`|8iAOasaxaa	Hard to tell  There would not have been a record turnout by blacks to vote  I think yes since the democratic vote was more anti bush backlash|`|be5d02d1dc7db03c5839affa5d0d722faa	It was time for a change and the democrat es turn is all|`|mT6b7INZaa	No... but when he leaves office in 8 years, he will still be black...
A7qDWyTYaa	I think they went along with it because they knew that they had controlled every single executive branch of the gov't for the first 6 years of Bush's 8, and knew that they were responsible for the debacle. They could run, pardon the pun, but they could not hide.|`|grBxTsK6aa	Because they were with it all along.  They just wanted to show opposition, so they can say "we're not with Bush, we're not with Bush.  Now, they'll say, "we're not with Obama".    They are fighting progress, which is why they lost so many elections.|`|xQgciq09aa	Gutlessness|`|J3IOlhd8aa	To try and get McCain elected, Stupid republicans, they disgust me|`|2oO36b0maa	Talking about cracking, please look at the  Democrat party.  Thanks.  Why did they  block the bill about the economy back   then?|`|WCkOUF9aaa	The more important question is why after seeing the waste with the last bail out that the Dems want to waste even more this time.    BTW Obama was all for it too.|`|bmCInR5qaa	It's called false-rage.  It allows them to continue to externalize blame for their failures.|`|VBunjbhKaa	Good question.  They need to redeem themselves now if they stand any chance at all of keeping their jobs.  They have been a disappointment to me.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	Bush threatened to send them to Gitmo and torture them.|`|RMjcHfGTaa	Pressure from many different sources including Bush, Paulson, the media, the banking industry and more.  It would have helped if John McCain would have come out against it when he suspended his campaign, but he didn't and IMO cost himself the election.  Let's remember, many democrats were against it too, but like McCain, Barrack Obama supported the bailout and it passed in round 2, against the wishes of the American public.  I think we were all doped a little because what happened was too much power given to Paulson who didn't stick with the original plan.  That's why this stimulus plan that is in Congress now needs to be well thought out and debated and not another rushed piece of legislation.    edit - Its hard to be a check and balance when the Democrats have such a big majority.|`|MUcINsQ3aa	they are weak, like their counterparts up there. We have ALL been sold down the river|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Beats me. But it didn't help them in the elections did it?    Wonder how this will pan out for the Democrats.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	They didn't have a choice, the verichip implants in their heads told them to do it|`|tyvFUPOxaa	They knew Obama would eventually get elected, and they did not want the Republican Party to carry this gigantic albatross upon their shoulders throughout history--so they passed the big ugly bird to the Democrats. Just like Bush II would not admit that there was a recession for more than a year of his 2nd term, the other Republicans struggle to admit to their failures and responsibilities for correcting their mistakes. Oh yes, Bush II was trying to leave office with a positive memory from the people. Besides, he thought he got his international banking friends and preferred constituents paid off.    Personally, I recommend abandoning these bailouts; and I prefer for the Federal Government to defend the US Economy from future price fixing schemes like the American Petroleum Industry shoved down the throats of the American taxpayers, voters, and consumers last year. Personally, I believe all of the tampering with interest rates is a futile effort that just generates economicc instability; and from my viewpoint, it did fail miserably during Bush I's reign with Reaganomics. The economy can rebound as long as the fuel prices are held down: and if our next administration and congress blister the buns of anyone who would submit the American people to any future price fixing schemes in the future. Wall  Street and the international bankers would tell us to suck up our guts and tighten up our belts until we dig ourselves out of our financial problems: let's tell them the same thing.  If  American Homeowners are induring foreclosures and carrying on, the bankers can, too.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	I have no idea, that was a bad idea too|`|1ymL5LKlaa	They added some tasty pork for every state in the union.  Party of small government or a small party on the government tab?|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	they did so to try and give the people confidence that everything would be fine,that banks would be stable,i think they got pressure from the party to go along with it,i bet now if it came up they would have stuck to their guns and not done it|`|U50orfPhaa	That plan was designed to help banks and mortgages,most of the money from that is now in the hands of Obama's team, not even used yet.    Its this new plan that is FULL OF PORK and BS!  Its every single PORK BILL the democrats could not pass all in ONE HUGE PACKAGE to pass- its DISGUSTING!|`|CqqYQaHOaa	Because republican party is dead. Hence they will not win another election until they go back to being Republicans.
dBpmyIduaa	I see nothing wrong with asking them.  If they didn't want to talk about it, they wouldn't have mentioned it.  They may actually be opening an opportunity to talk about it and are waiting for you to ask.|`|c07v7O80aa	Probably more tactful  to ask how long they've been dead. That's more neutral, and you probably get the cause without actually asking.|`|HHv2qGGcaa	Just say " oh, I'm sorry to hear that, that is tough to deal with." If they want to share anything more with you they will...|`|iyhMF4HKaa	just smile, u can even laugh
xxDjV6Axaa	I would like to see parents held accountable.  We do not need to funnel more money into schools or buildings.  We need students to learn and if their own parents won't hold them to that, we can't expect schools to take their place.  It's BS that a child needs the best schools to learn.    I went to one of the poorest districts in my city.  I still went to college. My parents couldn't afford to send me so I don't buy into the poverty BS either.  Lack of parental involvement is what has made our educational system decline.  Look at other countries to see what is missing from ours.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	Get rid of all the bad teachers and replace them with people who actually want to teach.    That won't happen on Obama's watch, though.|`|fDuCamMraa	Basic economics being a base requirement for one.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	The teachers union should be disbanded because it is a political organization, and a voucher system should be instituted because private education is vastly superior to public.    Obama is against both of those things.    Son of Liberty has a good point economics should be standard.|`|YIWKPXokaa	Fund, drop or reform NCLB.  It's not working.     In High School, Classroom sizes have increased. A teacher now has a classroom size between 35 and 40 kids.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	More kids finishing high school for a start. Where I live 50% drop out.|`|AA10719402	I would like state funding of school stop funding through 12th grade.  As evil as it sounds, it's actually better to limit the education paid for by government.    Social costs exceed benefit to educate kids in geometry, calculus, trigonometry... there are some kids that will never use it and forget it as soon as they learn it.    Fund reading, writing, algebra, accounting, history... the rest can be paid for by the private sector if you wish your kid to move on.    They are educated earlier.. streamlined in a sector..|`|Fyq5nK4waa	We need school vouchers so parents can place their children in the school of their choice or even start their own schools.  Having the Government teach our children is a major failure.      Most of my teachers were poor at their job, not motivated, but they were protected by Unions and the Government.  Competition would allow the best to rise to the top and children everywhere will also rise to the top.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	We need start by teaching our young people to read and write.  We graduate many students from our high schools who read at an 8th grade level or below.  Among the developed countries of the world, we rank 18th in reading and 28th in math.  A student cant learn math if he/she cant read well.  We need to tell our students why a subject is important.  When I took my second algebra class in college, I was so glad to be done with it.  I remember thinking that no one would ever again ask me to divide a letter by a number.  Was I ever wrong about that!      I would like to see more emphasis on practical education based on learning we can USE.  We need to teach macroeconomics so our young people (high school and below) understand the difference between fiscal policy and monetary policy and how economies work.  We need to resume teaching civics and geography.  Some years ago, a National Geographic study found that a high percentage of our students could not locate the United States on an unlabeled map of the world.  Many of them thought Cuba was somewhere in our Midwest.    Back in the 1980s, some 95 percent of our high school students could identify a photograph of Muhammad Ali, but only 75 percent could identify a photograph of President Ronald Reagan.  Im a big boxing fan and I love Muhammad Ali, but that was astounding.      We also need to evaluate teachers based on how well they teach, not just how long they have been on the job.      Bottom line, we need to revamp our educational system to give students both the motivation to learn and the tools they need to learn with.  Reading is the primary tool.  Discipline is also needed in our classrooms.  Disruptive students cannot be tolerated.  They make sure that nobody can learn.    Jacob makes an excellent point.  If a student isn't keeping up, make him/her attend special classes, even on weekends.  Now, that will motivate kids to work harder and perform better.|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	I doubt that it's remotely possible, but I would like to see some cuts as far as unworthy teachers and then raise the salaries to the good teachers. Then I would like to see the bar raised a little. Switch from entertainment to skill. Teach skills and then business. We need to raise productive adults, not big kids. And it goes on... And for crying out loud, if you're going to cut funds in education, get rid of the unions, and you got it made!|`|Xk8AzsMmaa	the dumbing down of american kids needs to stop..that would be a good start...go back to teaching academia not test standard achievements|`|xhH3cB1Raa	Busting up the teacher's union would be a great start. Money isn't the answer obviously because the more we spend they lower the test scores are.|`|PiQbgxCvaa	I'd enjoy it if they stopped brainwashing our kids with liberal lies.|`|LFE0e8Qdaa	Ban tenure, issue vouchers, make teachers send their own kids to public schools. http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004...   We're already spending too much.|`|JDRj44xMaa	Wouldn't it be better for the economy if we had more people who had enough education to obtain a career, instead of jobs?     Careers pay more long term than jobs that tend to be short term, correct? Or am I getting this wrong?|`|dmCyY2SKaa	Take a chunk of money used in funding wars and fund schools instead.|`|AA11942937	You are kidding, right?    Reforms aren't going to do one darn thing to improve education.  the gov't is a classic screw up with anything it trys to 'reform'.    You want to compete with the world?  Then bring back personal responsibility for the parents and children.  Allow failure.  Make success a goal they have to work to attain.  Stop handing out awards for being 'present'.    As long as students can do enough to get by and actually get by, that's all you are going to teach them to do in the real world.  Parents and students need to realize that failure is a teaching tool just as much as a fake success.|`|IFVrLCNOaa	lots.. too long to go on here. but, a few changes....    1. truth in educational lending and job statistics for colleges. increased flexibility in student loan repayment terms.  2. convert student loan interest deduction into tax credits for individuals earning less than 45K. otherwise, just a tax deduction.  3. paying tuition for multiple children in the school system. so people that have 14 IVF babies don't pass it all onto the property owner.  4. providing parents with the option of sending their kids to private school.  5. improving the curriculum across the board.  6. making vocational educational training available to all high school students.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Get rid of tenure for all teachers. Raise teachers pay. Require Master's Degree's for all teachers. Require testing and licensing for all teachers. Require teachers to take enrichment courses each year. Require musical instrument training for all students beginning in Kindergarten. Secondary language instruction beginning in Kindergarten. Mandate parental involvement. Throw parents in jail if their child quits school.     Too many to list here. Total overhaul!|`|QP7VyPV6aa	i would like to see the standardized tests done away with. i am not sure how other states do things but here in texas our students spend an extraordinary amount of time learning to pass what is out annual standard test. and then they have the same issue with the benchmarks tests.  out of 36 week of school the spen about 12 of them learning how to take these tests. which are used to determine how well a teacher is teaching, and in turn what the bonus for them will be.  they use alot of "reasonable deduction" to learn how to take these tests. reasonable deduction doesnt teach anyone to work things to get the proper answer.|`|LMgUpEgjaa	I would like to see the educational system completely redone. As  it is very behind the times. Not much has changed in the last 200 years.  I would like to see school uniforms and closed campus.  I would like to see a more liberal curriculum, more subjects and more choices. Let the students decide in upper grades.  More teachers and smaller amount of students per class.  Better teachers and better pay. Less union involvement.  Bigger and better schools. Stricter rules. Special schools for violent or troubled kids.  None of this will happen because it would raise taxes and the USA is not interested in education. It has no political value and more uneducated employees are in demand for low level positions. Those at the top want to stay on top.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	We need to undo all of the feel good but ridiculous Liberal programs and mandates that have been inflicted on our school children since Jimmy Carter was stupid enough to create the Department of Education as a Cabinet level Federal Agency.    Before that happened, American schools were run strictly by the State and Local governments and no laws existed that came between the students, their parents and a school's administration.  At that time we had a public schools system that was the envy of the world.  A school system that produced the "whizkids" who managed to send man to the moon without so much as an electronic calculator.    But now that we have the Federal Government involved we are spending 1000% more money and the results are a high dropout rate, illiteracy, crime and violence in the schools.  There are now massive bureaucracies where there were none.  We are spending an average of $10,000 per student per year yet those students cannot find the United States on a Atlas.  But they sure know about using fluorescent light bulbs or recycling.      In reality, we need to cut off all the Federal dollars and all of the strings that are attached to them.  We need to reestablish control of public schools by providing Special Schools (reform schools we used to call them) where disruptive and uncooperative students can go to get the extra discipline, care and council they require so that the rest of the students are able to concentrate.      We need to get back to basics teaching Reading, Writing and Arithmetic and insisting that the students lean it.  Proficiency is not optional.  Students who cannot make the grade must attend special classes after school and on weekends until they are.  We need to care enough about our children to demand high levels of performance from them.      Finally, we need vouchers to break the grip of the NEA and force public schools compete for students.      *|`|IsGo50kqaa	Nothing will work unless the teachers' unions are broke.|`|AA11702773	I'd like to see the Federal Government but out of state business and let the schools go back to teaching, not teaching-to-tests.|`|35ZJauLkaa	effective|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Bring local control back to the schools and keep the federal government out.

AA11163314	The biggest problem the we have with the California budget is the lack of discretionary spending.  Most of the budget is taken up with bond repayment and spending mandated by the all of the propositions we have passed over the years.    IMO - the only way out of this mess would be to have a special election to select people to write a new state constitution.  Then have a referendum to approve that constitution.  Make sure that the new constitution requires a 2/3 majority to approve any ballot proposition to limit the voter-approved stupidity we now have clogging up the state constitution.|`|AA11819105	Give california back to Mexico, its the illegals that have bankrupted them|`|2aERh7hlaa	With the problems calf. is having the only solution that will work is cut have massive cuts to the budget.

Make it easier for people to become america's  Make baby killing illegal  Kill murders, faster death row process  Give gay people something other than "marriage" that is seen in all states, but don't call it marrige.

I believe that these were at the core of Americas decline.    The world refused to respect and do business in an America that so blatantly despised everything that wasn't white and christian.    Plus you people crippled our scientific community, and scientific innovation with your hatred for science.  To this day you probably still do not realize how wrong your Intelligent Design bull---- is, and that is a HUGE problem akin to if our ancestors had discovered electricity and then refused to harness it because of a book that some damn near cavemen had written.    Change to me is an America that doesn't refer to itself as a "Christian nation" every chance it gets. Why is this importantly to me?  I could give you a million reasons, but just as a primer, why don't you go read the history of the Roman empire: it existed for a thousand years, collapsed only decades after adopting Christianity as the empires official religion. Why?  Because fundamental religion divides nations, it does the work of our enemies for us.  For example, the US military kicked out hundreds of gay service men, dozens of which were highly trained interpreters, simply for going against Christian dogma.|`|KVBTtF9faa	Let's not forget that he tapped the Taliban Defense Lawyer as a top justice post.

I am not and was not a fan of Bush. I voted against him twice. I am not a republican or a conservative. In fact, many of my views fall under the catagory of "liberal" however, I see Obama as nothing but WRONG for America. I do not think it's in America's best interest to have elected a man who's mentor and paster is an anti-american racist, who is a friendly acquaintence of former domestic terrorists, or who's "friends" and associates are known felons.  I think any Obama supporters who deny these FACTS that even Obama has admitted to is just too blind to see the truth.     I understand that after 8 years of Bush we Americans need change - but I think Obama is bringing the wrong kind of change! It's only been 2 weeks and I am in FEAR of what the next 4 years bring.

I've been talking about the manufacture of consent here in America.  It's a multi billion dollar industry and it has over 100 years of research and development.  Advertising is the bas@ $d step child of the industry.    The human brain, for all its complexity, is still just a highly sophisticated input/output device.  That is to say, the output is reasonably predictable if you know the input.  Taking it a bit further, if you can manage the input, you can control (or at least influence) the output.  Even a mere 10% influence becomes significant if youre talking about 300 million people.  That's 30 million people who's opinion is swayed.    Did I mention over 100 years of research and development into influencing people?  Did I mention that tens of billions of dollars are spent on this every year?  Did I mention that some of these programs have been running for over 60 years now?    One particularly successful one that has been ongoing for over a half century was started by Standard Oil.    http://images.google.com/hosted/life/l?i...  This billboard was one of many that was part of the PR campaign against the New Deal by big businesses led by Standard Oil at the time.  Standard Oil is no more, but the consortium of large companies continue funding the campaign against "socialism" to this day.    Their goal was quite simply to convince people that they can still trust big companies and big business to take care of them instead of the Government (sound familiar?).  It was an upward battle through the depression, but they had an advantage - FDR could only be in power for up to 8 years while they never had to stop campaigning.    Here's a quote by the founder of the modern form of this industry; Edward Bernays (double nephew to Sigmond Freud):    Those who manipulate the unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. In almost every act of our lives whether in the sphere of politics or business in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires that control the public mind.|`|lAjnRFSVaa	Many people also voted for obama because of media lies and influence i say we burn down the news networks which also caused this recession.|`|5rXzu0IWaa	It was not just the Bush family Clinton claimed he had WMD even thought the CIA always said they did not    I never bought it.

Should anyone dare to deny Moses, Jesus, Mohammad, capitalism, socialism or any ism is not a crime! However, in many European countries denial of holocaust is punishable by jail!! Ironically, the same mobs do not see the Israeli Holocaust in the occupied Palestine. Do you call it double standard and hypocrisy or manufacturing consent and opinion?    By the way, during the WW2 50 million people died. 30 million civilians and 20 million military personals! Yet, we do not talk a lot about those 44 millions and belting the Christ out of lost and found six millions. Isnt it a bit smelly?    Holocaust supporters,    Is it possible to present EVIDENCE instead of insulting and abusing people?     Remember this Israeli Holocaust in the occupied Palestine is going on in front of you and me.

If you were fired for a BS reason, you can fight it and unemployment will give you a phone hearing with a judge and he decides...  If he feels the company fired you for an unjust reason you WILL get unemployment funds.  Hope this helps!

The Republicans and Democrats love this nightmare of a tax system as it gives them the illusion of doing something good for people when they talk cuts.     The best tax system is the Fair Tax.  The Fair Tax will totally eliminate all federal taxes for anyone at or below the poverty line.  This is a fact. The Fair tax will allow business to grow at rates this country has never seen.  The Fair tax will encourage foreign countries to move their businesses to American creating even more jobs.  And last, the Fair tax will tax the rich and they will not be able to pass it on to us.

AA11345571	Well, a wedding may only be one day but you need time for planning, practice, spending time with all the guest that come in, etc.     Now to your question. There are a few reasons military people forgo a wedding. One is location location location. I am from Kentucky, my husband is from California, but we were both stationed in Germany. So do we have a wedding in KY and make his family travel? Vice Versa? Or make everyone travel to Germany? Or just do a paperwork marriage and worry about it later? (We went with that).     Another question is benefits. My getting married now, at a courthouse, you can take your marriage license to the military and start getting the benefits that married couples get (more BAH, housing verses dorms, dependant pay, etc). If you wait for an actual wedding to be actually married, that could be a year of lost benefits.     Most military couples do a quick courthouse marriage, and genuinely plan on having a real wedding later. My husband and I had a real wedding 6 months after we were legally married. I have military friends who say they truely meant to have a real wedding, but as time went on it became less of a priority.    Edit:  @Art Student  My husband and I are very much in love and married for love (going on 5 years now). So why not get some extra money? Besides at least I answered his question with opinions as to why some military people don't have weddings. You just bragged about how you waited and then put down military members by saying everyone else rushed into it and that's why divorce is so high.    Edit: LOL @ all these military wives fighting.   I hope you all have loving and happy marriages like I do, because in the end, that is what matters. I did not marry for money, it just happened to be a side effect. I was just answering the question. Unfortunetly there are many out there who do have fake marriages just for money/benefits.   Not gonna waste anymore time on this one ~ Peace out ~ God Bless|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Because, typically the groom is from one part of the country and the bride is from another part of the country.

We chose to do something small one because of the money and two because he was set to deploy and there was no way the military was going to give him enough time to get it all done. Now that we are PCSing to Hawaii we are planning to do something a little more traditional there but nothing huge like a lot of people like to do. And to tell you the truth many people in the military that I know have had big huge weddings sometimes that works for people and sometimes it doesn't. Money plays a big factor in the kind of wedding you can have when you are young and things have to be done quickly. Also the only time a soldier can take the full 30 days of leave at once is after coming home from a deployment, any other time they only allow 2 weeks max, at least that is how it was for us. And a wedding takes much longer than 1 day to plan so that probably has something to do with it too.|`|SqrPpm5Daa	Define real wedding.  I'd say that any marriage that can last 5, 10, 15, 20, 25...years together, much less together in the military setting started with a "real wedding".  Whether that wedding was one day in front of a JOP or took 6 months to plan.|`|9rhmeb7raa	I married a Navy Junior. The wedding invitation mentioned her father's rank (Captain U.S. Navy Retired) and mine at the time (Petty Officer Second Class). We celebrated a Mass of Christian Marriage in a church in Hollywood California. Following that we had a reception which involved about one hundred guests and we then headed for our honeymoon at Disneyland and Catalina.  So, yours is a general question. And all general questions are false. BTW, this July we will be celebrating our 44th Anniversary|`|hJNwAHccaa	30 days may seem like a lot but it takes MONTHS to plan and LOTS OF MONEY to spend.  We don't make enough money to be spending $10,000 - $20,000 on extravagant weddings and most people do not want to embarrass themselves by staging a cheap wedding either.    Plus with deployments as often as they come...who has time to plan for anything?  It's stressful enough as it is to prep for a deployment but to worry about a wedding AND a deployment?  Most people in the military just like to keep it simple.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	you think its enough time but its not. alot of people ruch marriages in the military to reap the benefits|`|7DlT0hGdaa	Jilly J do you realize how stupid you are making military wives look right now?

Grow up child.|`|X3MVUemWaa	Well for me it was the timing with him. He was home for a few weeks, he may have been getting deployed again so we decided to get married - we just wanted to. We already did a 14 month deployment, were friends and together for a few years, our families were on opposite sides of the country and we were tired of waiting. Military life can be unpredictable. We had immediate family, a small wedding that we planned in 2 weeks for the 1st few days he was home and we wanted the rest of the time to ourselves.    The wedding was just making it official, what we wanted was to be man and wife and some precious time together while he was home. Just being married was important, having the money to get a life started together was important, not spending money on just one day.|`|5Xp59a3Iaa	Fiancee and I were planning on marrying when he finished his MOS but before he left for PDS. We thought that since he'll be wrapped up in August it would give us plenty of time through letters and the ten day leave he gets after boot in April to plan the kind of ceremony we always wanted. I keep in contact with his recruiter and his recruiter told me today that I need to write him and tell him that we're being strongly advised to move it up and try to pull it off in his ten day boot leave. which gives me a little over two months from now to try to plan something that we thought when he left in january we would have eight months to plan. The recruiter suggested this because it takes so long to get paperwork done, and if i expect to leave with him after his MOS for his PDS that we need to get married asap so that they're not going to have to send him first and then be delayed by months before i can join him. (We'll have a two month old by then and it's one of those "the more time he can have his new family around the better" things)

c07v7O80aa	Good question. "Crime rate" really means crime reporting. An agency may collect its own numbers, and nearly all file UCR reports to the FBI. The numbers can be manipulated a bit by how you title reports. For instance, a department can call a report that a business door was pried on but not entered as criminal mischief or as burglary. Burglary is a UCR reportable offense. Simple criminal mischief isn't.     And one of the realities is that, if crimes aren't investigated vigorously, people quit reporting them, and it looks like the crime rate is low when it's not that low. The agency that follows up on even the minor reported crimes, even if they don't clear more of them, gets more reports, because people have an expectation that someone cares. The good agency gets bad numbers.     Rural states tend to have lower rates, both because the opportunities for property crime aren't as common and because people aren't piled in on top of each other. Also, because they just tend to be better at getting along.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Statistically crime is proportionate to population patterns.

hexzaIGgaa	That can range from the best time in your life to the worst time in your life. I found in my military career that my military experience became much more rewarding when I changed my attitude of privilege and entitlement and "joined the team."    It is all what you make it.    Good luck...now, get back to studying.|`|tvQStwpGaa	It's the best thing I've ever done in my life. I survived cancer twice and the treatment made me sterile so I can't have any kids. Well then after getting that news I went and enlisted in the Marine Corps and I've never regretted a minute. I love the military. God made me to be in the military. I'm only 5'7'' 150 lbs but I can do 25 pull ups, 140 sit ups in 2 minutes, and 75 push ups in 2 minutes. God made me to do this. I remember in high school I played football and I was benching 175 and squatting 230. I don't feel hunger due to cancer. I love my God, my country, and my job.|`|LwPcGpAOaa	Being that your only 13 the only way I can put it to you is play a sport like football where you get worked like a dog and get yelled at all the time.  You meet good people have some fun and hopefully learn something when its all done.  Plus you get paid twice a month.|`|1yJWrccXaa	This is an excelent question and you aren't too young to think about it.  In my opinion the two most important things to remember are: it isn't like 99% of the TV shows or movies that depict it, and once you sign up you have to serve your time even if you hate it.  It is federal law.  If you leave you can go to federal prison.  It isn't like a civilian job that you can quit.  A small percentage of people who join the military like it enough to keep re-enlisting and stay in for a career of 20 to 30 years.  It is kind of a tough life and you have to be tough.  In the military even when you have a specialty you have to do all kinds of degrading and menial tasks like picking up cigarette butts when you don't even smoke, take out garbage, scrub floors.  The reality is that it isn't glamorous.  I love the ocean and I wanted to serve my country.  I thought it would be like the movies.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  I joined the Navy at age 17.  I hated it and couldn't wait for my time to be up.  Like most who enlist it gets down to where you count the days you have left.  You view civilian life as wonderful and free.  Now the odd thing; I did my time honorably and I look back on it from my age now of 53 and I think that it was an overall good experience.  I went to the website for one of the ships I served on and I found out that many of the guys I remember from then are saying the same thing I am.  I miss being so young with such an open future.  And I now look at it like if I had tried a little harder to endure it I could have made the time easier on myself.  There were some good things about it too.  It is easy for me to say that now that it is all in the past and I am safe.  But my advice would be this for you: if you have realisitic expectations that it isn't like TV or the movies, that rather it is a tough job with some benefits and that if you are tough and can get along with a lot of tough people then if it is something that you want to do, sign up for the minimum time they offer and remember that it is part of your life that you will look back on as an overall positive experience.  Good luck.|`|F1VXXMrOaa	I don't know. Do you know why? When I was 13 I told my father that I wanted to join the army. Being his oldest daughter he reacted out of fear and said "You'll die!". Guess what, after graduating from college and working for a couple of years I decided its now or never. I've talked to a recruiter and am studying for my ASVAB (basically a test you take when you join). My fiance was active duty and now in the reserves. He gets all of his college paid for because of the army! Go for it if you are interested. I know that the life you see in the movies is not what you actually get, but it is still worth the experience. Oh, and I love my father and respect his opinion but lets not listen to him this time. You will receive a lot of great training to help you in tough times.

Ot7PJrddaa	If you want to join than you should go for it.  Everyone told me I was crazy when I first enlisted - that was 22 years ago.  The Army has been good to me.  That said it isn't a lifestyle enjoyed by everyone.  The work is not nine to five and deployments are tough for everyone in their own way.  You tend to move frequently which is hard for some and loved by others.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Have any of your friends ever been in the Army ?

If you carry a negative attitude you will be miserable no matter what you do.     Basic Training is going to be a culture shock and you will be treated differently than your used to but that's the way it is. Everyone before you that enlisted endured it and you will be fine. Once you put your time in and earn your stripes you will be treated much better. Rank has its priveledges.     Being in the military is a very different lifestyle than that of a civilian. You can be charged with a crime in the military that you wouldn't be in civilian life. Example: if you disobey a lawful order you can be charged under the UCMJ (uniform code of military justice) where in the civilian world if your boss tells you to do something and you refuse the worse that can happen is that you just get fired. There are many rules and regulations that guide what you can/can't do and you are responsible for so much but there are so many opportunites to prove to yourself what your made of and participate in amazing opportunities that are not available to the civilain sector.    Some people actually feel like their life is over when they are forced to retire from the military so apparently there is a select group that just loves the military way of life.     As far as some people coming back crazy, who's to say they wouldn't have went crazy without being in the military. Who knows?     The bottom line is you have to do what is right for you. Just because someone else couldn't handle life in the military doesn't mean your not strong enough. Decide for yourself if you have what it takes to be the best. Good Luck.|`|sgEloO1Jaa	why would you listen to some idiots who have never served the military is the best decision a young person can make for themselves. all your friends are probably going to school on mommy and daddys money to drink and smoke weed everyday then spend the next 10-15 years paying back student loans when their parents run out of money|`|BuGz6eU9aa	everything has risk.  boot camp has softened up over the years and the di's can only do so much to motivate a person.  deployments can be harsh but that's part of the job.  personally, i spent 4 years patrolling the streets of iraq and people say i've changed for the better.  if you're mentally strong you'll be okay, if you're used to people doing things for you...don't join|`|G19Fo9jYaa	aight, first of all, if you wanna join a branch of the military, why not go all out and join the marines. they make the army look like f*cking pansies. but reguardless of what branch you join, the same things apply.    you do get to see your family, and stay in contact with them. you're not a piece of property, and if anything, for all that you "loose" by joining the military, you gain so much more. you make friends and build relationships with the people that you serve with and have a bond that could never exsist in the civillian world.   boot camp, they tell you  that you will never be part of something as important and as courageous as this in your life, and they're right. the years you serve with the military will be the best of your life. they teach you courage, honor, respect, and you really find yourself in the process. i know it sounds like a bunch of bull, but trust me. and you'll be an inspiraition to the ones around you. the benifits that come with it, are worth any sacrifise. and you do not come back crazy, that's just a bunch of made up stuff. you come back the same person you left, but with a few minor improvements.|`|m9mJfUARaa	 1 You are a piece of property -- That is true. You are government property. Meaning you are responsible for your own actions. If you go out and decide to drink, than you get NJP'd. It's nothing ridiuculous though. You get up in the morning to work, get out of work, and then your free to do whatever you want (that is when you get to a duty station though)     2 You never get to see your family -- That is true. My husband and I are in California and our family is in Michigan. But they do come to visit us. You can take leave and see your family as well. But you only have a certain amount of time for leave per year.     3 You are miserable during a deployment -- In some cases that is true. But you do make a lot of friends who keep you sane. Some people like being deployed because they like like serving their country.     4 They treat you like **** in boot camp -- They do this to make you a stronger person and to be prepared for war emotionally. But you will see that your DI's are there to help you and to make you a soldier. You will have a good bond with them towards the end of training.     5 Some people come back crazy -- Only SOME come back "crazy". It's called post-deployment stress. It's mainly those people who have seen a lot and are infantry. Being a female, I don't think you can be infantry anyway.    What I'm trying to say is do what YOU want! Don't let anyone make decisions for you. The military is good for some people and bad for others. My husband is in the military and I was going to join as well. To this day, I still kick myself in the a$$ for my family telling me not to join.|`|5c7rgxA3aa	At least you are asking these great questions. But to go on...you need to first ask yourself...what are you looking for in a job, experience, skillset and quality of life? Those are the questions that should be driving your decisions...not what everyone else on here will tell you.    Each service are the best at certainly different missions...air power, ground combat, or force projection through sea power. And they all have some very similar jobs.     I'm am baised in that I'm AF...23 years of fun, travel, higher quality of life for me AND my family and my airmen's families.     Boot camp, or basic military training...are not there to treat you bad. They are to push you, change you from a civilian mindset into a military service, and to test you to see if you can follow orders. They teach you in those 6 -8 weeks how to become an airman, a soldier, a marine, or seaman. Basic training is a shocker for the first two weeks...then once you get used to it...you get better at it.     Best of luck!!|`|mr8isJoZaa	Don't ever be afraid to live your own life.  Do your research, make your decision and follow through.  Not hard right?  Your true friends will back you up, no matter which path you choose.  I have about 17 years in now and wouldn't change a thing.  Sure there are bad days and deployments suck, but we all go through it together.  Basic training sucks, but easy if you think about it, there is work to be done there, and that is it, its not a party, but we go through it, together.  You catching a theme here?  We take care of each other in the military, kind of like another family.|`|9sfeFdI8aa	First of all CAAAMO.org is an anti-military site. It is not objective, and has links to other anti-military sites. As an example I followed one of the links which led me to motherjones.com and a map of the alleged american military colonization of the world. When I clicked on Egypt (I just got done serving in the Sinai) it gave troop size, acerage, a cost to replace, and alleged that germ warfare was being waged. The installation (based on the troop size, the Navy medical lab that they site is made up of 80% Egyptian scientists) that they are refering to is the Multi-national Force and Observers. This is a multi-national force put togather as part of the Camp David Peace accord. The MFO's mission is to ensure that there is a peaceful border between Egypt and Israel. This is NOT an offensive force, and NO germ warfare is being waged against anyone.  Having said that, my 7 years in the Army as a helicopter crewchief have been the most rewarding of my life. Seeing family is not an issue, even if you are far away from home you earn plenty of leave. Much more than you would earn in a entry level position in a civilian job. As far as being property is concerned, yes, you have to follow orders, but it also means that they have to make sure that you are taken care of (food, shelter, proper training, etc). During Basic it is the job of your Drill Sergeants to cause you stress. This is in order to get you used to being stressed out (guess what war is stressful). As far as my experiences are concerned, I have been a MEDEVAC crewchief in someway for my entire career thus far. My unit was sent to New Orleans in 2005, and I am very proud of the work we did there. We flew 10 hours a day, and I don't even know how many people we moved to safety. My time in Egypt was very rewarding, I had the privelage of serving with some of the best soldiers and best friends that I could ask for.I also had the opportunity to make friends with soldiers from Canada, Hungary, Austrailia, New Zealand, France, Colombia, Uraguay, Fiji, as well as contractors from all over the world. The bottom line is that the Army is what you make it, and what you put into it. If you work hard and stay out of trouble, it can be a easy job to do.|`|hJNwAHccaa	The Army is what you make of it, not what the Army makes of you.  During Basic Training, yes, they will treat you like **** but not to the point that your self-esteem is so low you can't bear to look at yourself in the mirror.  They do that to motivate you to try harder to succeed.  It's all a mind game and if you can't handle that then you'll have a hard time in the Army.  Depending on what MOS you pick dictates how your mission will play out during deployments.  I always found some way to make my deployments fun or interesting.  I didn't do stupid illegal stuff as prohibited by orders set in place.  I always participated in MWR events like salsa lessons, pool tournaments, etc.  We always had a BBQ once a month behind out company operations with a makeshift BBQ pit we made ourselves.  Some people do experience a significant emotional event that causes them to go "crazy" but most seek help and are given counseling on how to deal with their experience.  It's up to you whether you feel like it's right for you and only you can make that decision.|`|1efab44c45307bd4314827ad52bed39caa	Your friend is a better friend than you know.

Just going to school traumatizes some people. If you live your life in fear of what could happen your life will be very dull and unfullfilling. The United States Military offers so many opportunities for young people today. Not only can you earn a paycheck but you can earn money for school, get school paid for while your in, and get training in an occupational field of your choice.    Life can be extremly challenging at times in the military, especially when you attend your initial training but it all has a purpose. Just keep in mind that many people have went through it before and you can do it to. It's all a mind set. You have to maintain a positive attitude and know it won't last forever. It really is a short period in your life and you may actually like parts of it.    If your interested in Nursing you might want to check into ROTC opportunities for Nurses. The military can not get enough of them and life as an officer is much more comfortable.    Hope this helps.|`|rx7e4Jogaa	The Navy has the best program for medical personnel.  The Navy has more medical facilities than any other service, as well as better training opportunities.|`|mm5p5sy6aa	Well, so far the easiest way I can sift through it in a nut shell is like this.  1.The yelling and 'hard-***' lifestyle that people seem to think everyone partakes in...well...I haven't met anyone that isn't afraid to voice their opinion, they don't all yell all the time, we get along and play nice.  2.PT isn't a very hard thing to do unless you're a 300 pound diabetic with asthma, it's like gym class exercises in high-school.  3.You meet all kinds of people, I come from a small town and this is still amazing to me the kinds of people I get to meet. I talk with everyone I get a chance to and learn all about different stuff all day, we tell jokes,do work, laugh,learn, get sh*t done. I have a great time and get along with everyone. If I initially don't get along with someone I figure out what went wrong, explain it to them, give them time to cool down, and try again.
Em88Qn3Oaa	I believe in capital punishment but I also feel that sometimes that it is the easy way out for them. Theres no real torture in it, no time to be made to feel remorse.    I am more for the EYE FOR AN EYE thing. If you kill somebody with a rusty ice pick by slowly pushing it through the temple then thats how you die.  If you cut off somebodys head with a knife, thats how you die.    This makes you really feel the pain you caused and will force you to KNOW what you did.   I may sound sick but they didnt care when they were doing it so why should we? This country has rules on how they can legally kill people. Why would you use an alcohol prep on the injection site of an executionee? Is he going to get an infection? NO, some one complained that it was inhumane to do it so they changed the rule to include cleaning the injection site.    Get some "marbles" and tell people to shut up when they have this type of meaningless garbage about nothing coming from their mouths.    Sorry for the rant!!!!|`|RuV7l2tAaa	Depends on the crime. A serial masochist mutilator who slaughters dozens of children and women should be executed, in my opinion. But if its for severe armed robbery or a crime which in which the criminal  did not murder or directly hurt someone, then life imprisonment.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	I have a good friend in prison for life. She wishes that they had given her the death penalty.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	Capital Punishment, I don't want to pay for them out of my pocket for the rest of their lives, my best friend works in a maximum security prison as a nurse and she says those guys have it pretty darned easy in there.      Killing is wrong, that is why they should be punished for it, the punishment should fit the crime.|`|2aERh7hlaa	I firmly believe there are people who are to evil and/or to dangerous to allow them to live.|`|3jBUJxOdaa	Capital punishment for extreme cases...|`|zLUQJxJkaa	I am against the death penalty in most cases. Our prison system is so messed up though. In terms of rape, more than one murder, sick kinds of murder and such I think that the punishment can fit the crime.  I agree with another poster, also that we have to pay for them to be there for life.. that is a waste when nothing else is going to be done. They are just there.. can't get out, just sitting there for the rest of their lives.  I am somewhat for the eye-for-an-eye thing. I think some of them should get a second chance, but unfortunately they blow that chance all to often.
tqD9xUpYaa	I'd say your case is finished ("You're free to go, sir.")because the state didn't file the charges in a timely fashion.  I'm glad your wife agreed that she didn't want to pursue charges, but be kind to each other from now on!    Chances are the judge was crossing out your info from his docket!|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Sounds like ur done, they will contact u by mail if there's anything else they need from u.   Good Luck to you and ur wife|`|c07v7O80aa	Apparently your state automatically sets a first court date following an arrest alone. No information had been filed with the court. I guess you wait and see if you get a summons or warrant if they choose to file now.
GMYNuFCDaa	The same reason a movie producer is paid millions, even though the movie tanked and lost money. The same reason they pay movie stars the big bucks with no guarantees. Why they pay a great college football player millions, and end up losing all their games like the Detroit Losers, I mean Lions did.     An expectation that they will be worth it. You can't just not pay them for services rendered if it doesn't work out, or someone else who gave guarantees would get them.    Do you think these guys give up money in those amounts without a good expectation that the CEO will help them make a lot more? Based on the fact that that CEO probably already has or they wouldn't get the big buck deals.     It's not all as simple as the democrats make it out to be, expecting that their constituents won't know the difference. If I were you I would be insulted, of course if I were you I wouldn't have the right because they would be right about me ... thus the phrazing of the question, right?|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Lets see, we bail out the companies with no penalty.   Gee, we are about to do it again and if you go against it the Obamatrons get angry|`|2KORqD1Oaa	Because the companies let them.  Or at least the stockholders do.   I guess we're all at fault for putting up with this kind of crap for so long.   In a way, this economic depression has had some positive effects in spite of all the pain it has caused us.  At least now we are starting to take a closer look at who does what to whom!  If we keep demanding reforms from our congressional representatives, then maybe we can actually see some improvements.|`|w95ffy31aa	Good question, I'd be willing to do it for a fraction of what they make.|`|qAL0CZIiaa	I think CEOs are entitled to earn as well as their company does.

I have several friends that work in "management", and each year are expected to create and meet certain goals for the success of their division or area, that saves money, or makes the company more successful.  It however, makes no sense whatsoever, to pay someone a bonus, when the entire company is in dire straits (i think I just typed a band name)
a66nvk0taa	Send scam email to them. God know enough Nigerians do it all the time lol
FdA7zXfcaa	Hello, Seen this situation many times.     No. if you are not nasty or threatening you can send a request for them to stop their actions. Keep this email and any email or communications that they send to you.     This will be needed for court.    If the problem persists then contact your local police department.  You can also contact the police and file a report for every incident, you dont need to wait until you have alot of stuff from them.    The police will make a report of the incident. Then contact your local court and file a warrant for harassment/stalking/threats. There are numerous charges that can relate to this such a thing. For that you need to consult your DA office.     I dont know what state you are in but that should be close to the process you need to follow.    I am im PA.    Good Luck and remember the police can give you alot of help. Just follow the law and dont retaliate and youll make out in the end.|`|cbIxKGZVaa	Take a copy of that e-mail to your local police department and press charges of harassment on this girl|`|5FVyVS9vaa	If you can, get a copy of the e-mail and go to the police. You are going to need proof that they are a threat to you. I would not respond to them at all.|`|7ny2EjjHaa	Go to the police she is harassing your sister and possibly stalking her. and threats are illegal as well.|`|GC9Xqz3xaa	Contact the police and tell them that this person is sending threatening emails and you would like to take some action to make sure that your sister is safe.  You're most likely going to have to get a restraining order against her but the police will help you with that.  Just make sure you have the email so you can provide it as evidence.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Did she keep the email?  I hope so...take it and any other evidence you might have to the police station and file harrassment charges against her.  I'd also pursue a restraining ordre against her.|`|dx7QSbkVaa	CALL THE POLICE  do not respond to her just call the police and get a temporary restraining order, it isn't just harassment it is threats

bBqPja7eaa	Completely agree with answer   1put the blame where it belongs:  Clinton, he put up with Osama and all the terrorists, and we know darn well it's true, he did nothing after we had the first terrorist attacks on the world trade center. That should've been enough of a sign and done something about it, instead of going around with Lewinsky! Good job Mr. careless, Adulterous Clinton!   Do your homework.|`|A90SRsTxaa	I think we should take the names off and just start calling them all "the man" or "the government". With that in mind, I can say I hate the government for trying to scare every one into passing this pile of garbage http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext... , just like they used fear to start the war on terror.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	You are just doing the same thing when you say Bush is responsible for the terrorist attacks even though Clinton went around bombing countries at will, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Sudan after the first WTC bombing. It's all a childish game and you are participating. There is no king or queen but if you want one you can surely find a country that has one.    >>EDIT: I was not blaming Clinton. That would be foolish since there have been attacks and hijackings for decades now.

People act like the Presidency of the US is some kind of kindergarten class, where it's good enough if you make an effort some of the time. )|`|41654d02889988fda122d249e98748f8aa	There definitely is a short term memory problem in the Us, but not only there but in this whole world! It is not different in any other country!  As you can easily see in the above answers, many people are already now mixing up and misjudging events of the recent past!  Even president Bush himself new better and did not blame president Clinton but admitted in public that he himself made mistakes!    The biggest mistake of pr. Bush was, that he totally misjudged (I grant him the possibility of "unknowingly") the situation in the US and such allowed this worldwide recession of today take its course!  That was not president Lincoln, that was not president Nixon, that was not even president Clinton, with no doubt that was president Bush!|`|HUkPtLR2aa	I don't know why every one blames George Bush for all our problems.  He did not do every thing correct.  No body does.  I think the real problem is related to a spiritual problem that started about 40 years ago.  This is what I call liberal theology.  Liberal theology is what led us down the road of legalized abortion and all the other sins we condone in this country today.  There are many people to day that don't even realize that they are sinners and need to be save and delivered.  They accept corruption in government and business as a normal thing.  It is not wonder our economy is failing.  I think the economy problem is a judgment of God, and until this country repents no amount of money will help
SWzTydgXaa	HAHAHA.  Sure.  How many democrats suggested that John McCain was born in panama?  How many democrats ask offensive questions aimed at the presidents daughters?

It's amazing to watch this circus play out. Another day, another Dem appointment crashes and burns. Today there were 2 - Hilda "It's my husband's taxes" and I'm a lobbyist Solis, and Leon Panetta who accepted speaker fees from 2 of the bailed out banks and he's in supposed to be in charge of Commerce.

Congressional Republicans, who have the luxury of being the minority party with no power or influence after screwing up the country as badly as they did, can pretend like they suddenly care about federal spending when they're the ones who blew up the national debt under Bush. But GOP state governors, who have real responsibilities and have to make decisions for a living, are clamoring for a stimulus bill to be passed PDQ. So which is it, Elephant Party? Make up your mind.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Why is the "stimulus bill" being rejected as being pork laden, risky, wrong or too large by other democrats?  - You haven't given any names or specifics so the statement is meaningless.    Does it bother you to see your idiocy being up for public display?  - That's your incredibly biased opinion.    Does it bother you that Obama's popularity has dropped 9% in the last week while Americans watch the infighting within your own party while we suffer?  - That's flat out false.  In fact Rasmussen has his approval rating higher than it was a week ago.    Are there enough supporters like the ones interviewed on "how obama got elected" to keep your party in office for at least the next two years?  - Anyone considers that web site to be anything but a source of inaccurate partisan rhetoric is not particularly bright.|`|e2e2ccd6c15e732cbfc8b82485ecb4ebaa	Oh yes!|`|PiQbgxCvaa	You mean the "US Communist Party".|`|7pf2pGBUaa	yes us republicans has it all figured out  we know all about approval ratings and idiocy  and we are not suffering because of the bush administration  bush's mess is not going to take YEARS  to clean up|`|N5jBMjrDaa	No, there is no need for a name change.    There are items of the bill that need to be re-evaluated.      I guess you have forgotten the previous 8 years of idiocy.  You might want the refresh your memory on that one.    This isn't a popularity contest.  The last time I checked there was fighting in both parties that was keeping things from being accomplished.    I haven't seen "how Obama got elected".
qwaWd14vaa	wikipedia know what you are looking for first.  Type in Felony Murder Rule not a law.  Ring v Arizona 536 US 584 (2002)|`|AA11622716	Each state has some variation of the rule|`|AA10163820	I imagine murder is a felony all all states.    You sure that's what you wanted to know?    EDIT:    Kinda' sad that the poster and others don't know the difference between the felony murder rule and something called a "felony murder law."    There are answers on Wikipedia about the felony murder rule, and they do not specify which states still use it - nor did any other resource I checked.|`|AA10232957	Kinda sad that a law enforcement officer doesn't know what you are asking, but anyway, I checked wikipedia, but no answer. sorry|`|c07v7O80aa	I expect every state has some form of the felony murder rule that says that if you cause death during the commission of another felony, it's murder, even if you didn't intend to kill. It is usually limited to certain felonies, the sort in which you could expect violence to become a part of the action. Robbery, burglary, theft, etc. It commonly doesn't include less active felonies in which no reasonable person could anticipate a risk of action leading to a death. There are significant differences on how they apply the law of parties to these cases, which means whether some coactors can be held responsible for the death. I have never see a web site that actually contains all the law of every state.
PWvS7vqPaa	The other posters are in the right area, but are technically wrong.  It is not a Federal Firearms License that you need, but rather a FFL/SOT or Special Occupational Taxpayer license.  This is what allows you to purchase new Class III items from various manufacturers.  However, it is not just that simple.  You must also have a department letter stating that they are requesting a demonstration of one.    In reference to your state laws, they do not need to specifically state the Hughes Amendment.  Class III items are regulated by the federal government and state law cannot over ride that.|`|AA10206116	No. You need a federal firearms license to buy any fully automatic weapon. And unless you are somehow involved with the government, you won't get one.|`|AgknNcLWaa	yes, you need a class 3 firearms license though, its kinda expensive/hard to get though. VERY VERY VERY extensive back ground checks

I actually have seen some evidence of racism being reduced since the election. Mostly because black people are no longer looking at their race as an excuse to be a failure. Many are finally accepting what has been true for a long time. That there is equal opportunity for all people regardless of race. There will always be racist individuals in there world. But the views of a few narrow minded people do not define our society. Racial oppression is no longer an issue in America.    I do think Obama himself is extremely racist. He's an awful human being and will be an abject failure as a president. But symbolically, he still has some value. When I see black news correspondents and comedians on television, they are no longer blaming their troubles on the white man. They are taking responsibility for their own lives and realizing that no one is holding them back but themselves. That is the biggest hurdle in overcoming racism. If they can just break free of the mental enslavement of the Democratic Party then there will be true equality for all.    But Obama himself is the biggest racist fraud to ever walk the Earth. He sucks.|`|bIaywrBCaa	No, having a black president will not end racism. There is racism for whites against blacks and blacks against whites and of course other races as well.

Obama is a extraodinary person. He will effect the perception of blacks but......  Racism has been culturally ingrained in a lot of whites.    Most whites don't know enough about the history of Blacks in America to understand why Blacks are as they are.    Most people like to deal with people that look like them.    Blacks and whites live in two different cultures. They do overlap but the wide variance in language indicates how far they are from being concentric.    for Bpacks to make a move to end racism they cannot all live bunched up together.|`|BPZPxzBnaa	I'll start.    1) Republicans still exist.|`|7y6yfrQlaa	no, they have really been revealing themselves lately|`|WlDVd92paa	NO    but it's on it's way out of POWER.|`|A90SRsTxaa	No way it is worse according to Obamabots.

I am one who disagrees politically and my children are biracial, sooo... I am not racist - that is a lame crutch being used by many ignorant people.    I'll give four reasons - simply put - there are whites that hate black people and there are black people who hate white people - yes, simply for skin color - that is a small majority reflective of the election though.|`|nqywzf69aa	NO......I dont need to list 3 reasons,all you have to do is hangout in the elections forum !|`|lzpdyYa5aa	This is bull.

B07sKfdvaa	America has been moving towards a socialistic/entitlement based society/government ever since the New Deal initiatives in the 30's.  Although most of those were proven to be failures and did little other than to improve the moral of the American people while prolonging the Depression for 7 years, people still took notice of how powerful the government could be.    In the subsequent decades, labor unions and radical political groups began to buck authority and redefine the middle class.  Although most of the policy of these groups has been based upon myths or outright lies, they have captured the minds of American youth that would rather experiment with drugs than maintain a job.    These groups speak to youthful ignorance and arrogance.    These groups exploited the civil rights movement by creating victim groups, especially urban blacks.  They piled them into subsidized housing communities (as socialist as socialism gets), not in an effort to assist them, but rather in an effort to concentrate the all important vote.    They expanded similar welfare programs, while adding medicaid and other forms of state assistance to the mix.    Please pardon my oversimplification of a rather complex matter, but I was intending to show our national move to socialism as being a decades long effort, and nothing new.    Liberals find power in making the working class lethargic.  The American dream is right out the window, and is replaced with satisfaction in working for someone else and their American dream.|`|x0UfImRkaa	socialism is bad......and i dont like it.....but most of all im....im.......iiimmmm.........ima goofy goober rock!.......your a goofy goober rock!........were all goofy goobers rock!.........goofy goofy goober goobers rock!.....put ur toys away, when all i gotta say when u tell me not to play i say no way (no way) no freakin way......ima kid u say when u say ima kid i say say it again, and then i say thanks! thank you very much.....so if your thinking that you like to be like meeeheee, go ahead and try, the kid inside will set u free! hamalazabalashabalazibilahamazibalibop..... goofy goober rock!.....ur a gofy goober rock!......were all goofy goobers rock!.....goofy goofy goober goober rock! aaaaaaaahhhhhhh....(guitar solo) wooooohoooo!(patrik)......(plankton goes to mini jain for psycopaths...)|`|V6onK216aa	The government can try to move America in a socialist direction as much as it wants, but it won't happen. Let's look at the worst case scenario and it does happen: It will fail and we will vote out the people in charge and the new people will reverse it. SOCIALISM DOES NOT WORK and Americans will NOT tolerate it because Americans demand success.    The Democrats can try their hardest to use fear tactics on the poor and minorities to get their agenda across, but it will never happen. They just use the socialism strategy to get votes. The U.S.A. is already broke. If we implemented universal health care, we would be so broke our economy would go directly into the toilet and would never come out.     The crazy liberals will tell you how great socialized medicine is, but here are the facts:    1. You have to wait weeks when you have an EMERGENCY.  2. Health professionals don't like the idea and it will affect them the most.  3. Whenever you make something economically equal the quality goes down. America has the best health care quality in the world.  4. If it's so great, why do so many Canadians come to America for surgeries?  5. When wealth gets redistributed only two economic classes exist: Very Rich and Dirt Poor. The "very rich" group has all the people in the government. The "dirt poor" group is everyone else.  6. When you remove competition from something incentive reduces. Without incentive people do not produce. Why would somebody work hard to be a good Doctor when Dr. Joe Hackjob gets the same pay?  7. The Declaration of Independence offers all Americans life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This does not GUARANTEE that all Americans will be happy or have a fair shake. Get over it.  8. The only people who like the idea of socialism are disadvantaged whiners who aren't willing to work harder and crazy left wing ideologues who want to control how other people live.    If you want watered down health care, inferior education, a poor economy, and the government telling you how to live your life, then Socialism/Communism is the government for you.    If you love America, if you wake up every day thankful to have been born in America, if you believe in work ethic of Americans, if you want America to be YOUR America when your children and grand children inherit it, then support AMERICA. America is a country that is mostly capitalist mixed with MINOR socialism. Period.  Let's keep it that way.    God bless America.|`|1eOQdqRTaa	Socialism cannot work. Because the government controls the market and production, there is no way for it assess supply and demand, and know what to produce.

mN6UKLfLaa	It basically means that if there is a state and a federal law that address the same issue but are in conflict with each other, the federal law trumps the state law.    For example: Let's say you are a public housing tenant and federal law states that if a public housing agency demolishes a federally subsidized public housing unit, the resident is entitled to moving expenses and counseling to get a new residence. However, there is a state law that says if you are in federally subsidized public housing and the housing authority demolishes it then the tenant is entitled to 4 years rent and moving expenses.     Since both laws concern federally subsidized public housing tenants and the state and federal laws impose different requirements, the federal law trumps the state law and the only thing the federally subsidized housing tenant is entitled to is counseling and moving expenses. They do not get the 4 years rent on top of it.|`|obdew3HWaa	The legal answer: (United States Constitution)   Article VI - "The Constitution... shall be the supreme law of the land"  Ratified by each state of the union.

AA11494150	The officer's radar unit sends out a beam of a known frequency. A portion of this beam reflects off the road and returns to the unit, which determines his patrol speed. The remainder of the beam continues down the road. When the beam reflects off a moving object, the frequency changes. The faster the speed, the more the frequency changes, allowing the unit to calculate your speed.    That is a simplified explanation, but the bottom line is radar is recognized as accurate to plus or minus 1 mile per hour.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	To answer your question.  1.  RADAR (Radio Detection and Ranging) is nothing more than a radio signal transmitted at you.  It is a simple matter to calculate the time that it takes for the signal to be transmitted to your vehicle, sucessive pulses are used to calculate the speed of the target (and the speed of the police cruiser is factored into the equation).  RADAR has been used by police agencies for decades and they are proven to be pretty reliable, but there are things that could cause them to provide an erroneous reading.  Weather (rain diminishes the capacity of the equipment) Other vehicles traveling in close proximity to the target (if you were on a two lane highway and there was a vehicle near you he may have got the wrong one, the detector simply records the fastest target in range, the officer judges which one it is)  Certain Neon signs can also provide an error in the reading.  You should ask to see the  calibration and maintenence logs of the gun used to clock you, if you are going to fight the ticket.  If that particular one has not been calibrated or serviced (or serviced excessivley) you have a chance to get it thrown out.|`|5IFv1NDTaa	Yes, radar in a police car can be used when the police car is moving.  The way it works is through radio waves.  The radar unit will pick up the largest moving thing in the area so if there was a trator trailer truck near you, it would pick that up over your car.  The unit sends radio waves out, they hit the vehicle and then send them back to the unit....the amount of time it takes the radio waves to come back to the unit determines the speed.  Now the units must be calibrated once a year to ensure proper functioning.    Hope this answered your question.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	It can be used while driving, it adds or subtracts the speed of the police car automatically.    I remember when it came out years ago and the 2 cops who stopped me were getting everyone coming the other way and doing u turns to catch them.|`|LFYr9iH0aa	Police radar use the Doppler effect to measure the speed of a vehicle. This is the effect :-    A signal is directed from a stationary source towards an object that is moving relative to the source.  Then, the signal reflected from the moving object has a different wavelength, and hence a different frequency, from the source signal.    I'm not sure what calculation or adjustment they make for having the radar on the move as the Doppler Radar source tends to be static. For example, you don't have the radar of an airport driving around on the back of a lorry.    If the radar source was at right angles to you, your speed reading would be zero because the transmitted and reflected frequencies are the same.    So the Radar on the Police car must have to know the velocity (speed) of the Police car in order to make an adjustment to the Radar waves returning from your vehicle.    There was a court case where this guy took it to court because he disagreed and the Radar gun was aimed at the magistrates bench which showed up as doing 5mph. As you can imagine the case was thrown out because of the calibration was wrong. Are the calibration records on the Police car up to date?    It's an expensive call to make if it doesn't work out in court !!

5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	This could be a long list, but Ill be brief.    I think of government corruption as when the government channels a countrys wealth to an elite group that supports that government rather than to the people.  Zimbabwe is right up there, as is Mexico.      Robert Mugabe, president of Zimbabwe, seized land owned by white farmers and gave it to his cronies, not to the people.  Zimbabwe used to be the bread basket of Africa.  Now it is a net importer of food.  Its economy has been ruined.    In Mexico, the leaders of the country (Pepe Calderon and his predecessor, Vicente Fox) live in virtual palaces while the general population lives in shanties.  Crime is rampant and drug cartels are gaining power every day.  Even Mexicos army cannot deal with them.  It has been suggested that the police and military are looking the other way when it comes to the drug lords.  Those who dont are often killed.  Mexico is experiencing anarchy.  No one is really in control.    Historically, when the Italian Mafia ordered a hit, they took out an individual but did not harm his family.  The Mexican and Colombian mafia bosses believe in killing everyone on the premises, sometimes in gruesome ways (beheading, etc.).    Mexico is overpopulated and its oil wealth could be put to good use by educating its people.  But much of its oil revenue ends up in the pockets of the elite few who have strong ties to the government.  The country is all but lawless.  Kidnapping, murder and rape are common almost everywhere.  It is a dangerous place to be.  Many residents will not leave their homes at night.    Acapulco used to be "the" place to vacation in Mexico.  Today, it is crime-ridden and not a good place to be.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I think most capitalist countries are equally corrupt in their own right.

Capitalist countries corrupt whichever country they touch.

5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	This guy is heading for trouble!  I'm not even in law enforcement and I can see several possible charges.    Driving while privileges revoked (MI license revoked).    2 counts of presenting false documents for filing (one for fraudulently obtaining a NC license, one for presenting that license to his employer as valid).    1 count failure to notify a licensing bureau of an address change.    1 count obtaining the use of a motor vehicle by fraud/ unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.    Of course he can't get a license in IL!  I am surprised he got one in NC (particularly since he is not, and never was, a resident of NC!)    This dude needs to come clean now, stop driving the company car (or any other car for that matter), surrender the NC license, and report to his company's management the truth.    He is living on borrowed time, if he gets caught ... WOW! will he have problems!|`|XRYAfxpTaa	Yes, he is attempting to evade the revocation and that is illegal.|`|YJrrZo9jaa	He is definitely commiting fraud and frankly I'm surprised he was able to get a NC  license at all.  I recently applied for a NYS license and had to surrender my MI license on the spot, they also made me wait while they checked with the MI Sec of State to verify my driving record and make sure it wasn't supsended there.  I assumed all states had the same practice.  Seems like if he gets pulled over, he'll get arrested AND lose his job.|`|24kFbAdsaa	He's driving without a license regardless of the validity of the NC license.  When you obtain a license via fraud (not telling NC about your MI license), you NC license is not valid.    If he's pulled over, I see possible hefty fines or jail time plus unemployment.|`|AA11494150	If he is pulled over in MI, it will be discovered. He can be charged with not only driving after revocation, but obtaining a license by fraud.

KVBTtF9faa	I think it is a bad decision that helps the terrorists and does not serve the American people.The prisoners held there are only more enraged with America now and their return to al qaeda only proves that. I read that they are going to try to re-educate them once released and I just don't believe that will work. These are hateful people, and I don't think any amount of "re-educating" is going to change that. Obama saying that they will no longer torture terrorists just says to them that they can do whatever they want and they won't be made to suffer for it.    For those that want the links as proof they are returning to al qeada:  http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/23/world/...    http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/01/23/m...    http://infidelsarecool.com/2009/01/25/gi...|`|zejFr1Ciaa	I think that it's a real problem. It appears that to keep a campaign Promise President Obama signed an executive order without thought of what to do with the inmates. Well I don't want them in Kansas which raises an interesting point which is if we need to move them vs releasing them doesn't that mean they are dangerous and need to be incarcerated? And if that's the case why close Gitmo isn't one  facility as good as another?|`|zlmnfFpYaa	As distasteful as holding terrorists in Guantanamo may have been, legally speaking, it very well may have been the best solution to a very difficult problem.  There probably isn't enough "real" evidence to convict them in an actual court trial, but the fact remains they pose an ongoing threat to the US if released (as evidenced by your acknowledgment that several have indeed returned to their previous occupation).      Obama's decision to declare the closing of Guantanamo is both hasty and ill-conceived.  Let's hope this isn't the beginning of a pattern.      Edit:  And here's a link for those who seem to have trouble keeping up.|`|HPwniNNlaa	-No proof of any "terrorist" on 9/11  -American scientist made anthrax      Whose the real criminal?|`|lHDff8Braa	First of all, those prisoners who have already been released were found to not be threats, so either the government didn't do it's job well enough to prove they were dangerous, or they were innocent when they went in and just learned to hate America so much they turned against us during their captivity.  Either way, it proves that holding prisoners without charge for years and subjecting them to torture has not decreased the threat of terrorism.  What to do now?  I think each prisoner should be tried.  If the government can PROVE that they are dangerous or criminal, they should be imprisoned - preferrably in a SuperMax prison like the one in Colorado.  If the government cannot prove it, they should be released and deported to their home country.  Even if they end up back in Al-Qeada or wherever, that is the price we must pay for living in a sociey based on the rule of law.|`|q9PVawNyaa	First of all how do you know any of these people were terrorists? Do you believe that you are guilty until proven innocent? These people have never had a trial, many of them were interned on little or no evidence.    As for what you want to do with them. I say you take them to trial if found guilty put them in a maximum security prison, innocent let them go and compensate them for the imprisonment and torture that they underwent. You were already paying for them to be kept at Guantanamo why can't you keep them in a real prison.|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	Is that true?

6rxhges4aa	don't fall for that old chestnut!!.    if you can travel for two hours to get into work to "discuss your problems" then as far as he is concerned you are well enough travel to work.    if you have a signed medical certificate from your doctor (which your company should have been given a copy) you can stay at home until the certification expires and there is nothing your boss can do about it.    tell them you are sticking to the standard procedure and that is an interview will be conducted on your first day back at work to ascertain whether you can continue your duties.|`|okqK8hV1aa	You do not need to go see your employer in person nor is there any other matters to discuss.  Legally, you do have every rights to rest until you're fully recover depending on your insurance policy prenancy covers.  You can call them to find out.|`|cbIxKGZVaa	Is it going to kill you to go see your employer for probably at most 10 minutes?|`|OHfZFR31aa	Your employer cannot dismiss you while you have a doctors note or even while you are pregnant.     However, they are legally allowed to ask for a meeting with you to discuss your condition, if you feel you will be able to return to work after the leave expires, what sort of duties you will and will not able to perform when you do return, etc. If you cannot make it to them, you can request that they come to your home to meet with you.|`|cb9c8be6c633186631612c54c6c11d0aaa	if you have a doctor's excuse that requires for you to be home?   tell him..  no, going get in trouble if is say this.  i would not go if i were you,|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	Ask your employer what it concerns. If you have a sick note from a doctor then the employer is actually powerless to force you to do anything.|`|Qqj1VTmXaa	Your first priority is to phone your employer and inform him that whilst you are under the sick note you are not under any obligation to go to your work place to see him and as such invite him or a representative to visit you at home or wait until you return to work on the 17th. I personally feel he is looking for a way to let you go as i can see no reason why he could not wait until you return to work other than cancelling your employment with them.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	Ido not know your employers attitude to sick leave. Some are good and some not so good. My previous employers were usually very good but they have been taken over by  a company which is not so good in fact quite poor in their attitude. This will get worse as the crisis deepens if     I think the trick here is to appear reasonable. If you genuinely can not do that journey say so and invite them to your home. This actually gives you a motale advantage because you are on home teritory. i do not  think I don't want to is a very good reason. Talk to your doctor and if you are in a union talk to your rep. I have a gut feeling that decisions have already been made. i do not want to distress you but i have to be realistic|`|7zVvAzJCaa	Usually they want to come to your house to have a meeting with you (which is allowed).  They can request you to go & see them but only go if you're well enough.|`|WNsjy5oFaa	your employer probably wants to see you for a risk assessment, if you don't feel upto it you dont have to go, you can arrange to meet up with them when your certificate runs out or when you have arranged to go back to work. you can also refer yourself to occupational health to discuss any issues with them.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	You can ask him to come and see you at home if you prefer.  I was off sick years ago and the same thing happened to me.  They came to my house, because I was not fit to go to them.  They discussed what was wrong with me and when I would likely be able to return back to work, if I needed help, etc.  They obviously want you to come back to work.|`|2ab686f19f6ca470d996180cb7fd6ecdaa	It depends on how long you have been on sick leave, Employers usually call you in some where near the end of the contracted time you are allowed to have on sick leave. Many firms allow a year and call you in say six to seven months of that period. All firms have that right and it is to your advantage to go to the meeting but always, I repeat always take a union representative with you. If your not in a union make sure another member of staff who you trust goes to that meeting with you.    They can't sack you while you are sick but after your contracted sick leave is used up your employment can be suspended without pay or even terminated. I know it sucks but you need to make sure you are protected.    ATB Red|`|eNpRHpB3aa	If you feel well enough and there is no medical reason WHY you should not go in for 20 Min's, then i would say it would be in your best interest to go and see your employer. They will probably want to discuss your return to work or see if you need anything eg a different chair etc. longer rest breaks, Whilst you will be getting sick pay for being off work, i would work with your employer if you genuinely want to/expect to return to work at some point and not hide behind a sick note,|`|mNzgWFkGaa	I advise you to dig out your contract and read it over carefully, in a company I used to work for the manger could come and see you at home in situations like these ( long term sickness)  I don't think it's necessarily something to get worried over, lots of companies have a similar policy. I think you have the right to ask that he comes to see you rather than the other way round especially if it takes you 4 hours to get there and back again when you are sick. You could call and explain this to let them know that yes your willing to discuss your problems/work or throw the ball back in his court because he's the manager  so he should be fully clued up on his employees rights regarding sickness and legal issues. Do read up on your contract. Whatever happens here's hoping that you get over your illness and that your little baby is just fine.|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	If you are showing sickness certificates to your employer I believe that they have no right to contact you regarding your condition. I would certainly seek advice from the CAB or ACAS regarding your rights.
AA11622716	Prisons serve several purposes.  They are notoriously bad at rehabilitating prisoners (because many were never habilitated in the first place), but they also serve to punish and to protect society.  They are OK at punishment and they do stop prisoners from committing more crimes in society at least while they are behind bars.|`|Yzb44aV6aa	They help the other people, on the outside, to keep the criminals away from our society.      I really doubt that a lot of the prison systems do any good to the people housed in them.  I dont think that the majority of prisoners get rehabilitated.  In some cases, its the other way around.|`|2MVG5StDaa	Prisons do nothing to habilitate prisoners.  Prisons have become nothing more than human warehouses.  It is perhaps the most dysfunctional system of incarceration in the world.|`|TGuyq4sGaa	Matter where you go. In california my cousin went to a prison, most of the guards were mexican and they picked on him and beat him up just to mess with him. But then you go to somewhere like colorado and the prisons are not as bad with race but its no where you want to be. Also remeber there is many different kidns of jails/prisons. High Security like for life sentencing all will be different but in my opinion they are for the most part dysfunctional
l4pVsxoraa	Upon completion of 20 years of service you are indeed eligible for a pension.  It wouldn't be half of your wage though.  Basically you earn 2% per each year of pensionable service so after 20 years your pension would be 40%.  There could also be penalties imposed on the amount of pension you're entitled to depending upon what terms of service you were serving under when you hit 20 years.  As an example if your enrolment contract allowed you to serve for 25 or more years, you'd be penalized 5% for each year you didn't complete up to 25 years.  What that means is let's say your gross pension entitlement is $2000 per month.  You'd be peanlized 20% or $400 of that amount because you didn't complete your contract.  If on the other hand your contract expired at 20 years there would be no penalty.|`|Jj30buLMaa	Surely 20 years is retirement age, i have no experience but i figured that was standard across the international board pretty much.

"If you're applying from India, this notice is on the Australian High Commission website:    'Important News for Student Visa Applicants and Education Agents  The New Delhi Visa Office has seen a significant increase in the number of applications received. As a result, processing times are currently at 12-14 weeks for a student visa application lodged at the New Delhi Visa Office. Your course should not commence until at least 12-14 weeks after you lodge your application.'  http://www.ausgovindia.com/ndli/Visas_an...    If you have a typo in your date above and really mean that you applied om 4 Jan 2009, it doesn't look good for getting your visa in time.

ad3ORARNaa	Yes.  They control through subsidies the amount of some produce is also controlled by the feds to keep the price stable.  Also one of the biggest ways the government controls the price of a lot of food is by the embargo of Cuba.  Cuba is embargoed only because the price of sugar, which is in a lot of our foods, would drop if Cuban sugar was allowed into this country.  The embargo has nothing to do with their form of government.

2e70f61678e5494169ede4a28e641c3daa	Normally you should apply for ILR 28 days before your ELR expires, not before, and definitely not after it expires. Your ELR will in effect be extended until they give a decision, but if you leave it until ELR has already expired, you will become illegal and could very well be refused.    As others have said, you should definitely get proper advice - if you apply now and your application is rejected, it will cost you around 750 for nothing; on the other hand, if you could apply successfully now, a year after you could apply for full citizenship if you wanted - highly recommended as ILR can be lost in certain cases.    As far as I know, they will not usually consider an application while you have more than 28 days valid leave.

N4ZAzxdMaa	Murder is the act of killing another human being with malice, traditionally called "malice aforethought." Malice is defined as the intent to kill or to inflict bodily injury, either express or implied. If a deadly weapon is used, intent to kill will necessarily be implied by a court of law. The presumption is that if the assailant brought a deadly weapon with him/her there was an intent to use the weapon. If the assailant picked up a weapon at the scene of the crime in an act of defense or in a provoked fit of rage, there might not be malice. See homicide and manslaughter.|`|SJX3jMh9aa	Killing someone without a good reason.    Killing someone who breaks into my house is NOT murder  Killing someone cause he bought the last candy bar IS murder  Killing an unborn child cause you can't aford it IS murder  Killing someone who has killed or attemped to kill others is NOT murder  Killing someone who beat you at a video game IS murder  Killing someone who said you looked ugly IS murder  killing someone who was charging at you with a knife is NOT murder  Killing someone during an act of war is NOT murder  Killing someone who is attacking you with any type of weapon is NOT murder    Just the first things i thought of :)|`|XRYAfxpTaa	Basically, murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with intent. The health of the victim is not relevant. Murder a patient in an ICU and it's still murder. Smother a chronically ill child and it's still murder.     A gang banger can stab another gang banger, and although not an innocent person, it's still murder.

Q7ovix19aa	No.  The US does now, but not much longer.  Your naval power started dying when German submarines and Japanese fleets began to grow.  WW II finished off the European dominance, after the crippling in WW I.  The US rose only because we were whole after the war.  We helped crush the other industrial powers.      You all have been coming back.  The Chinese and Russians are also rising now that they have the depressing yoke of Marxism off their backs.  The current economic trough will end if the overpopulating societies stop that.  Then a lot of nations will again compete even in the naval arena.    They all want to protect their resources from the overpopulation now existing, or take resources if they are the overpopulating societies, ever desperate for more.  That's what causes most wars.  It won't end until overpopulating does.    I suspect you built a naval power and an empire because you instinctively knew your islands couldn't support coming population.  The Japanese islanders did the same thing.     A lot of your excess had moved over here during those campaigns.  So did excess Germans, Irish, Italians, Poles, and many others.  Now it's excess Hispanics flooding in here but there is no longer room for them.  Their excess is crushing our economy like European population excesses of the past, and present, has periodically crushed yours for centuries.|`|hexzaIGgaa	The US is ahead by leaps and bounds, but the UK has a formidable force.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	No USA is by far ahead of anybody else in naval terms. Britain is a distant second (not saying that Britain's navy is bad, just that US is better than everybody else by a long shot) and are a good ally to have.

sPQBluKEaa	if you are under 18, yes.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	It depends on the State and the particulars of the law enforcement statutes, as well as they type of agency the officer works for, but....    ...generally speaking, a police officer is a police officer 24/7 and in most cases has 30 days or more to issue a summons.  If he's planning to summon you for smoking underage, then he's seen you and he certainly can issue the summons by mail, by hand the following day, or on the spot if he sees fit, though very very few police officers will do that off-duty.    By not stopping you and examining the cigarette,  he will not have the ability to determine whether you were just smoking or smoking something otherwise illegal, but it sounds like he's just going to ticket you for smoking underage.|`|fxqRJNmYaa	yeah u can get a ticket like its already been said if your under 18 but idk if the cop will give u one just make sure u tell the truth and u never know he might just wanna talk with u
c07v7O80aa	A biological parent trumps anything the mother can say in a will. He will get custody by default, and that will only change if it can be shown he would be a significant risk to the child. His non-involvement will be a factor for the court to consider, but it won't be the deciding factor.|`|IVSqQQzlaa	The legal test is what is in the best interests of the child.  The biological father is not automatically granted custody or even access.  The court will make that determination taking all relevant factors into account including the biologial father's behaviour.  It is a very difficult analysis and depends on the facts in each case.  If a biological father had zero invovlement in his child's life and the grandparents played an active role and were named in the Will they may be granted custody.    There are so many things to consider including the age of the child, the child's history, where he lives, how close a relationship he has with his other relatives, the father's character (if he's a drug addict with a criminal record that will not help his cause).    In addition to naming your parents as guardians in your Will you should have a frank discussion about your wishes with them and request that they take court action if necessary.    If your child is old enough at the time of your death his or her wishes will also be taken into consideration.   There is no age set in stone but if your child is 12 or 13 for example and tells everyone clearly that he wants to live with his grandparents and doesn't want anything to do with his Dad that will be persuasive to a court.    I would recommend you make an appointment for a consultation with a family law lawyer in your area.  Often consultations are free or at a reduced rate.  Also, the lawyer who is drafting your Will should be made aware of your concerns.      Good luck!|`|dM8EyL6caa	Yes, if his rights are not terminated he will get sole custody. And the courts will not take "he said she said" into consideration. However, if he is not involved and does not pay child support his rights can be revoked. The courts will only revoke his rights if there is proof of his absence and as long as there is someone to take the responsibility.  Get a lawyer and go for it.

NFiiIQcxaa	Some jurisdictions now have human trafficking task forces.  Call your sheriff's department and let them know what you are researching.  The investigator assigned to this should be able to help you.
tguEmxVyaa	Not true. They have no way to tell if you received your summons it's sent regular mail.Just throw it away like you never saw it but jury duty is really fun.I've gone twice and my wife has put hers in the trash and never been arrested.|`|z88IMXNFaa	I've been in court when the judge signed the bench warrants.  He was well and truly Pi$$ed off.
CdBdP2ymaa	if it is proven...it can be serious.
OBnNGcfHaa	I love my Bates Steel Toes they are super comfy. I love most bates they brake in really nicely and fast. They also last along time. They run around 125 and you can get them at most PX's.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	There are a lot of females who buy Doc Martens and boots at Journeys.  Go around and try some on.  If they feel comfortable right away, then those are the ones for you.  They should never hurt or have to be broke in.  You may even want to go to a store where your foot can be measured and assessed.  You may have issues like a narrow heel.|`|r6zLN0Daaa	crystals right bellville are the best.|`|mm5p5sy6aa	the winter wear boots are damn comfy. Try a little gauze in your sock if you can't solve your heel problem.

MNqwUHypaa	Many were killed in battle. Father in law was wounded twice but lived. He saw some horrible action and everybody in his platoon died. When he was drafted he was beginning a career in a big swing band. He was never the same when he came home. Drank very heavily and moved down to Buffalo and painted cars. He played every reed instrument. He told me his best friend's head was severed and he brought it back to to headquarters for burial. Guess how many things like that happened?|`|rx7e4Jogaa	None really.  There economy wasn't large enough to be affected, and socially, they became socialists after the war, which continues today.
oMOiAFRBaa	Uh, Pelosi and Reid are the ones setting policy and ARE the ones in power right now.  If you voted for Obama/Biden, you were really voting for Pelosi/Reid, and if that wasn't blatantly obvious to you, than you clearly weren't paying attention.    "Getting rid" of Pelosi and Reid is not an option.  Obama was the DNC Mascot and salesman - you are effectively asking if Ronald MacDonald would run McDonald's more fairly than their own executives if we got rid of the executives - it doesn't work.  Obama doesn't know how to lead, that was never supposed to be his role.|`|2YyQAmufaa	As much as I dislike Obama I dislike Pelosi, Frank and Reid much more.  Those three need to be voted out of office.|`|IwBIM1tVaa	They are the new pawns he needs them|`|4pN1Zmaeaa	Three peas, one pod.    fs|`|Rb5rW8nvaa	he needs to pull his head out of his azz first|`|1pB2Cr6Faa	I like how some democrats are running around in the Whitehouse calling Pelosi's plan a stinker!  They say Pelosi is robbing the future!  I am glad they are not all brainwashed!|`|55NKPb82aa	Why can't her district request a recall to fire her?|`|BbK0fA4Laa	Probably.|`|TsjqzanQaa	I disagree with you, Obama is the problem.    He obviously doesn't intend to "govern more fairly" as he wants the tax dodgers in his administration.    He was forced to recant his appointment of Daschle only because of the public outrage over this flagrant flouting of tax laws by another self-serving politician.        He really wanted this individual in his administration, and said that he would "stand benind him."    Yet he admitted "I screwed up."        He also screwed up by his appointment of Geithner, another flagrant tax dodger, but Geithner still is in the administration.    If one is wrong, then other is also.      This makes Obama an obvious hypocrite, and if Obama had a shred of integrty, he would fire Geithner and also admit that Geithner was also a mistake.    But Geithner managed to get in with only a small amount of public outrage, so he's probably there to stay.      So this proves that there is no "equal justice under the law" in either Obama's administration, nor the United States.    Isn't it ironic that the politicians won't pay the huge taxes that they saddle the rest of us with?        They tax us to death, and turn around and give the money to cronies and special interests, frequently getting bribes and kickbacks, and then they squander all of our tax dollars.    Obama is the problem.       Business as usual in D.C., and the cronies can get away with just about anything.    Obama is just another politician.    Anyone who believes a politician is a fool.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	Obama was ranked more liberal than both of them.  Their views are almost identical.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	It would make us happy but that is not what is keeping Obama from knowing how to lead.  He seems to not know what the bully pulpit is.  Nice.|`|AA11600810	So, those two are his ego.  Silly me, I thought an ego was a personal trait or character.|`|5rXzu0IWaa	I think you are correct.|`|AA11138176	He has no experience to lead he will not listen to the average American and neither will the other 2 all 3 will hurt this country worse than Pelosi is useless as far as I am concerned Reid I do not even know what his purpose is.Obama is not a leader in the least all he is is a pawn for the Democratic party to control everything|`|ee7afa2284dbb71d60c6d9445eb13af8aa	I think that the real problem goes way beyond our Senate all the way to George Soros in the UK and whoever else Obama's allegiances are to outside of the U.S. because they're sure as hell not to this country or the American people that he is supposed to be representing. His catering to the Muslim world spoke volumes about who really owns him.|`|MM8rqTMtaa	Reid is a joke.  He's wants the Congress to give up their day jobs to fold to Obama's will.    "As I have explained to people in that group, they cannot hold the president of the United States hostage," said Reid, D-Nev. "If they think they're going to rewrite this bill and Barack Obama is going to walk away from what he is trying to do for the American people, they've got another thought coming."    And I thought writing Bills was their job.|`|3f7UV5zDaa	Obama has long held a Socialist agenda.  He has strong Socialist advisors who also hold that agenda and they intend to push it everyday in an effort to establish a Socialist society in this Nation.  Pelosi and Reid are merely there to help.|`|zkzDLcznaa	Go straight to the head of the class!|`|NqNbIp2caa	The American voting public would not seem to agree with you.  49% approve of the way Congressional  Dems are handling things and 59% think it is a good thing the Dems control both houses.  You can get rid of them by reclaiming the majority at the 2010 election. But the country seems pretty adamant that that shouldn't happen.|`|d9afb5f10eed7750b0b4604b351f8e22aa	Pelosi flys on her own plane to San Francisco every weekend, and the taxpayers foot the bill.  I am for  getting rid of her asap.  In a poll 90% of the people said they dislike her, yet she was reelected by the group of welfare recepitents that have bled California dry.  This country is in trouble, because of people like her and the idiot Harry.
8Y583Fluaa	fair enough but this si phelps second time on camera "sorry, i made a mistake" a mistake is not getting behind the wheel drunk..and he was givin a chance and now smoked pot...kids need to see there is consiquences...i know i didnt spell that right...have a good day|`|AA11600810	I have an answer for this, but it would just be deleted, so I won't say a thing.|`|MzgPbMOvaa	Phelps and Obama are both sitting on a couch in the White House attic snackin on Cheetos and hiding their weed when Michele calls up to them to "Get a job you lazy bums!"|`|JthubNIsaa	I think it's a shame that Kellogg's isn't renewing his contract next month. I for one am not buying ANYTHING made by Kellogg's.|`|SGyRIjCIaa	I know! So stupid.. and Phelps is 23 years old. People want to act surprised by this? Marijuana is so common and I can't believe people don't realize that.

They do not need to pay them, but they will fine you big time for not reporting a dime.|`|69bp1IMfaa	Your a snot who can't accept losing your a hoggat.|`|cPPBGiYgaa	The whole Michael Phelps thing is ridiculous. So what, he smoked a lil weed. BIG DEAL! Most politicians have also.    With friends like Phelps apparently has, who needs enemies?|`|acWyJ3t0aa	I don't know for sure what your question is , but I am one hundred percent behind your statement . After all Obama said there would be no favortism shown anywhere in his command ands since Phelps represented the USA in the Olympics , I think he should be punished but that it should not go on forever . He is a kid and made a mistake . I guess if he , like Obama and past presidents did, it would have been perfectly all right .|`|UoUaO52taa	I disagree w/the suspension. Any other swimmer gets nothing. It's BS|`|0eFSeap5aa	We hold Olympic athletes to higher standards than we do politicians.  For that matter we hold child molesters to a higher standard than we do politicians.|`|GItb4cxmaa	Well companies don't want a druggie to advertise for them. Think about it.|`|MM8rqTMtaa	Of course everyone can talk.  If you had small children that looked up to the guy, it would be fun to hear you explain this to them.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	I haven't heard too much crap about Phelps, he got suspended for 3 months and lost a cereal contract but that's it so far. i think it was actually seeing him doing it in the photo that bothered people. I mean, we all know Obama did coke but it's another thing to see a photo of him doing lines with $100 bills!!    Actually, the outrage isn't too high and marijuana should be decriminalized soon.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	Phelps should be criminally charged, as should Obama, Bush, Clinton and any other pot-smoker, regardless of their day job. No one is above the law. If you don't like the law, work to change it, but until then, the law stands.    As Kevin Costner's Eliott Ness said in "The Untouchables" when asked what he was going to do if Prohibition was repealed: "I'm going to have a drink."|`|KLg658F3aa	People actually looked up to Phelps.|`|supRA4eOaa	Obama also did cocaine, and still smokes.    People who are upset about Phelps need to get a grip.
s3E3KfBsaa	He has ethical standards?|`|xxDjV6Axaa	You said it, not me!|`|acWyJ3t0aa	He did know and he does now . He is just putting on a good show because some watchful people caught him and he has no valid excuse so he ordered them to step down and not say anything bad about him so he can come in behind and say he never knew and that he would be more watchful land careful in his next appointments . He just tried to push them through before he and they could get caught.|`|HgKlFEpBaa	No, I think our little community organizer is just getting to know todays liberal democratic party.|`|hSZDVKF3aa	What ethical standards.|`|4Aauh87yaa	Yes, Obama is showing us just how much a community organizer is in over his head when he tries to run a country.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	Yes he is an idiot.     As far as his ethics, he has non so that is a non issue.                Moon bats and surrender monkeys
5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Thats not what I heard him say, but then hes been in office a whole three weeks, complaining that he hasn't yet stood the world on its head seems a little odd.|`|KhBmlaefaa	Warren Buffett is a moron. He pays Cap Gains tax which is nothing (it's just 15%) so of course he's being undertaxed, in his opinion. If that bum volunteers to pay an even higher Cap Gains tax rate then maybe what he says might have merit. He's nothing but hot air to me though. How about he donate all his money to the government, bet he wouldn't even think of doing that. He loves making money, but he's not so generous in giving it away, unless it makes him more money.|`|otYOxmnuaa	You don't tax people when the economy is tanking -- even though he was waivering back and forth on the issue before his inauguration, he finally decided now's not the time.  That time will come though.    As for Warren Buffet -- in everyone of his books, he talks about dodging taxes by investing in the long term so he won't be zinged w/ Cap. Gains taxes.  For a guy who brags about "dodging" taxes all of his life, he's surely jumping on the tax-the-rich bandwagon w/o shame.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Where do you get this crap?    Is Rush on pills again?|`|oOPhM172aa	He is taking care of his rich donors in Hollywood.    Obama said the rich just can't afford to pay any more right now.  What a joke!|`|zqPjdhgKaa	If you listened closely to Obama's campaign you would know he said that if the economy is bad he would not raise taxes on anyone.  With a bad economy, it is not a good idea to raise the taxes on anyone.  He needs to wait until the economy is stronger to raise taxes.|`|WP1W2KlLaa	Obama did not say that, you do.
qRnXasisaa	it is a great link and it speaks a great volume of  Bush & Cheney administrations what were they all about... I have to add the ppl answering your question living in a lie and they are so confused it is not funny... these confused and delusional pplz are still supporting and defending crocks like Bush & Cheney .. it is a shame and it is a disgrace to those who lost their father, mother, sister, brother, kids and fellow citizens in this war for profiteering  for companies like Halliburton..|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	What difference does it make, where the corporate headquarters is located ?    The headquarters for tax purposes, remains in Texas.    But since the bulk of halliburtons work, is done in the middle east    It makes since for the CEO and his staff to be located in the middle east.    You do know, Halliburton has NO government contracts now.    Halliburton has NO employees in Iraq or Afghanistan now.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	Yup the DEMS are bailing out.....the company is OWNED by the LBJ family and George Soros.....but hey why let little things like FACTS destroy the libs lies....as they keep SPEWING that it is owned by Cheney....and he only worked there|`|4rfEWg1qaa	Any smart capitalist owned company would bail the heck out of here in the US b/c we are not free-market system anymore. There's no way to increase profits in the US right now.    I'd personally like to go to Dubai, "the golden city erected in the sea."|`|b31dbdcb27d3c5c8df1a7f8d790d7ae8aa	Halliburton was appointed as a government contractor during the Johnson (LBJ) administration and brought back again by "Slick Willie" Clinton. I don't know any tie-in with Bush other than Cheney working for them initially. The fact that they were employed by GWB also speaks volumes about politics as usual.
bf72cfdf93e36079005e699867cef828aa	it is Hegelianism.  thesis. Antithesis. synthesis.  you are offered a choice to a problem that was manifested by the one offering the choice. Now you must choose between to offered solutions to solve the problem. Both choices lead to a predetermined answer and solution.  there never was a choice.   there never was a problem.|`|AA10382849	I choose not to answer this question...now do you know.|`|wbJXqkVGaa	It is fine to be anything but to use your brain to think independently without the fear of seeming odd because you can see beyond what is. Most people don't like smart people. Most children hate smart children. Just follow the crowd to the dining hall so you can eat too:-)    Just a thought;P|`|4pN1Zmaeaa	Just what is this "Bob's Chicken Soup" of which you speak?    fs|`|m1HVh5YUaa	There are other choices besides Democrat or Republican but I get your point.    It is about a false dichotomy. A sort of good-cop/bad-cop situation.     When the government doles out two guys like this last pair, actually out of all four of them, you had a guy with brain damage from aneurysms who says people should pay more taxes to express their patriotism, a woman with a shady past and a wink who has African witch hunters pray over her, an old guy who couldn't lift his arms without wincing who says we should continue on the downward spiral literally, and a skinny kid from Chicago who talks like life is a greeting card but whose agenda is one of a sadistic demon, and you are told to choose, then is there really a choice?    No, there isn't. The sooner people realize this, the sooner we can have elections in which the two major parties are the Liberalis Party and the Master/Slave Party.    >> EDIT: choice is an absolute and cannot be measured by magnitude. It exists or it does not, and it exists in more situations than people care to admit to. Great people from history have died proving that choice is present in the vast majority of human situations.|`|60YMS1xkaa	Interesting question. The best trick a master can play is to let the slave believe he's free.    Our freedoms always benefit the government. Why would they keep them around if they did not? It offers control -- that keeps them happy, but the illusion as well -- and that's supposed to keep us happy. As for choosing political parties...what does it matter? They all benefit the government. They all work for profit.    There are things our country is founded on that DO represent true freedom, but they are abused to the max. Take for example freedom of press. Supposedly, one of the reasons the USSR was "bad" was because the State controls all the media and censors it. Ringing a bell? There's freedom of speech. Good sometimes, useless others. Since when has a protest changed the governments' mind? They don't care about us. They don't care what we want. They want profit. And they ignore us if we stand in the way of it, and yet STILL tell us we are free.     And we like brainwashed fools brag to other countries, pity others because we feel we are so free and they are oh-so-oppressed. And we wonder how anyone could live in a place where the media is controlled by the government.|`|BYu1X7ljaa	ha ha ha thats very black and white isnt it? Anyway choice itself is an illusion, i dont believe for one second the people have the overall say whether you are a republican or democrat.     People can stand up and fight for their rights but it seems the government has really got us to hush up hasnt it? Owell i guess we all die sooner or later lets just hope one day Tim minchin will run the world then maybe we can laugh again? gha ha ha ah here something to keep your mind of conspiracies and hateful thoughts...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujUQn0HhG...

It was also the stupid president and his stupid  policies.|`|3DOQG6hEaa	The Republican dominated ones from 2000 to 2006? You can see their (and Bush's) handy work right now... just another failure of the trickle down economics you guys seem to love so much.

If we were actually getting what we are being told (creation of new jobs by adding infrastructure) I would still be dubious. This does not help the out of work engineers who worked in auto and electrical ... Architecture is an entirely different ball game.  I could maybe come to terms that it would help someone. However the actual Bill and what is entailed is over 1000 pages of pork! My reasoning I have read and looked at it. There are several special interests and welfare programs. I have heard a lot about the state pet projects ( dog parks and spas) .. These will not create the jobs we were promised. I have nothing against helping and creating nice things when we have the extra $$$ to do it, however this shaded sneak it in under false pretenses is realistically fraudulent advertisement to the American people.

We know that when we get out of the depression, we will once again be putting stresses on our infrastructure: bridges, electrical grids, roads, etc.    Employing people to build infrastructure:  - puts people to work and puts unused factories into production  - prepares our infrastructure for the future  - puts money into the economy very quickly, because working people will spend the money on their family right here in the USA.    Inflation is unlikely because inflation results from too much money chasing scarce goods.  But, we have the capacity to produce the goods (food, steel, concrete), so there is little or no inflationary pressure.    As the economy picks up, the workers can move into their usual workplace.    Then, when the economy is doing well, the infrastructure, being in better shape, will make the economy run more smoothly, making inflation LESS likely than ever.

VT9Sl9NNaa	Hell no. My family gets money through unemployment, and my mom just got a job teaching, so we're gonna lose it. The cheapest health insurance we can get through the state is $1200 a month.    And if you think my family's lazy, my dad has a Bachelor's in computer science. He's currently the manager of a UPS Store. The owner is very cheap, and refuses to give my dad any benefits. He used to make $50 an hour. Then Bush became president, and his company laid off every single employee and moved to Mexico. Seriously.  February 2002. He hasn't worked as an engineer since then. He delivered pizza for two years, too.     Employers are able to get away with not giving benefits to full-time workers, and it's unfair. Even if universal healthcare never happens, something must be done to get employers to give benefits. Everyone deserves health insurance. Doesn't it say somewhere in the Constitution "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"? Inalienable rights? Well, you need health insurance to have those "inalienable rights".

945Wewnyaa	Very interesting! I remember a while ago at Uni, there was some uproar about a guy wanting to start a "White" club, pointing out the many various Asian and other ethnicities clubs; but he was obviously shut down by the institution :)    I think their thinking may be because you are from a European-based country(?), so the global diversity element will require soemthing from a non-European context.     In terms of racism, who may it be racist to? To the Europeans (for not counting them within "global diversity"), or to the minority races (for making them some kind of special, exotic category, that mainstream culture "studies").    Anyway as an Asian thats studied a lot of European history; including the Holocaust and genocide studies, I think that yes your University might need to do some rethinking. However I don't really thinking it's trying to be racist :)|`|EPqnB7Epaa	Yes, that is racist.  No, I don't agree with it.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	No I do not agree with it .

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	People can be released from prison if they are later found innocent.    You can't un-kill someone.    Below is a link to cases of actual people who have been exonerated after being sentenced to death.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	We're equally concerned about innocents in prison. That's just it, though: if someone turns out to be innocent and they are in prison, you can let them out. Can't bring a person back to life after you kill them, though. In any case, you entirely miss the fact of the matter here: "without reasonable doubt" is a subjective and imperfect system. You will not find a prosecutor or judge in the country that will deny that innocent people occasionally fall through the cracks. It happens. There are hundreds of documented cases, just as you point out yourself. For example, ever hear of Ruben "The Hurricane" Carter? Didn't get put on death row, but was imprisoned for murder when he was innocent. Served over a decade before being exonerated. With that in mind, it is simple logic to assume that it could happen to someone on death row. Sorry, but this is the one airtight argument that the opponents to the death penalty have. You can pretend like the cases don't exist, but it is a fact.

I would like to see better enforcement, too - but any honest look at the situation will show you that losing all of the illegals at once would wreak havoc on our economy.  They're just too deeply embedded into it to yank them all out like that.  The economy would tank even more than it already is - combining that with the current problems, I can't even imagine where we'd end up.|`|acWyJ3t0aa	It certainly would be that at least , plus we could stop giving them aid, free educations, and giving them our dwindling social security . It would actually be a big boon for the American people . We could stop having everyone learn Spanish in America to speak to non English speaking illegals here . It would decrease the unemployment , spend less dollars , and open up more homes , because the illegals do not lose their homes , only the hard , working , tax paying Americans lose their homes and jobs .|`|81be3df3d8de061d2dc682fbb8dc28b3aa	but who would fry his chicken.....|`|a405fe6055a8e90eb60d333024ff3097aa	More Americans would be working.

Or the Wall St, firms that went under, or the banks that have closed.  Most illegals are working in smaller firms that can get away with not having checked out their employees, like day laborers.  Its Americans who are losing their jobs, and we need to face that.  Illegals also aren't figured into the numbers since they don't have real social security numbers and can't afford to apply for unemployment lest someone find out they are illegal.  Its not just the other guy anymore, its college grads and people who have long worked their way throughout their lives.|`|wi1ufSwfaa	If I were in another country illegally, do you not think they would kick me out as soon as they caught me?  To tell you the truth,  If I were to be in any country illegally it would be ours.

ZhZOckPPaa	You can not really have a short answer for this very important document. They are dealt with in the constitution specifically, it is that each party have stepped on them for years. Our elected governments Duties are spelled out in the constitution, and all others rights fall to the people (Tenth ammendment). When reading the constitution the Declarationn of Independencee should be read along with it, look at it this way you have every right in the would to do what you want as long as you do not step on another individuals rights same rights you have been given, you can think and have your own beliefs but do not impose those beliefs on another individual, if you look at it this way and everyone did this the constitution would not be stepped on all over the place in Washington.|`|AA11702773	10th amendment.  those rights are reserved to the states and the people.|`|SCzrZosXaa	All rights not specifically covered by the Constitution are relegated to the people.|`|M0ZDvXrAaa	The Constitution is a declaration of war, its The Bill of Rights that outlines our rights. Of course the courts have passed laws that serve as rights as well.|`|Y3Ik7iq0aa	I think you might be talking about "implied powers" which are powers that aren't directly stated in the Constitution.     If not then I guess you could just say ammendments.

If they did they should have seen that he was very unqualified. I'm waiting for someone to post "trust him" "give him time" ect ect.    Butafly you voted for a person who promised change but as far as I can see it's business as usually in America.  You voted for a person who thinks that the constitution is a living breathing document, this contradict the constitution itself.  Our founding fathers created the constitution to protect our god given rights, they did not create a document that could be changed at the drop of a hat. They did not want a system that would be governed by mob rule, that is why we live in a Republic not a direct democracy.  I could keep going but since your response is as empty as one of Obama's speeches I won't waste my time with you.  I would suggest you pick up a history book on the founding fathers sometime.|`|3TjiJls7aa	yes i am very happy i did.     and i'm disgusted with the response that said most people who voted for him don't know whats going on.

And it is so sad that the last guy made it necessary for us to have to say these things.    I am absolutely still happy I voted for President Barack Obama.|`|S4FajOvhaa	Yes, thanx. I did think alot about it and did not want a hate-mongering party to "stay the course " any longer.     BTW. McCain was sooo instrumental in agreeing with the status quo, that a majority of Americans decided to try something different.   So if you did not like the results of this election, start making better plans for 2012.

YvjTJPEfaa	Yes it should it is far less addictive (it's still debatable whether it is even habit forming)  than either tabacco or alcohol and is significantly less toxic than alcohol, the LD50 (dose required to kill 50% of test subjects) for weed is estimated 3000 mg/kg (consuming 21lb of marijuana, or smoking 250,000 joints in one session). It is worth noting that this is just an estimate as no one has ever managed to kill a lab dog/monkey with marijuana and no faitalites have ever been attributed to the drugs toxicity.    In addition unlike alcohol marijuana makes people less likely to fight and if ingested (magic brownies) does not have the same harmful effects as smoking.     As for health benefits it has been shown to offer non-addictive palliative care for chronic diseases and lessen some the side effects of chemotherapy.    Finaly I think you'll fine marijuana evolved naturally, God had nothing to do with it or any other part of reality.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	NO! It needs to be decriminalized.

It is about 20 miles south of it.  I have spent three years in Korea at Camp Casey (1st TANK!!! WHO YOU WITH?).  I left in March 2007.    Second, as long as you are the dependent of a military member, then, YES, you can get on post.  Only once have i seen all of the peninsula locked down to that degree (9-11).  They locked everything down for about a week.  You will have no problem getting on camp or any of the other camps in the ROK.  You might not be able to stay at the post hotel though.  It is usually booked.  There are hotels off post that you can stay at and he can get permission to stay there while you are in town. If they are on an elevated alert status, he might not be able to leave post for extended periods.  They don't stay on extended alerts for more than a couple days.    I would recommend waiting until tensions over there calm down before  flying over.  Also, save money and pay for a room at the dragon hill lodge on Yongsan (seoul).  Tong du Chong (the city outside the gates at Casey) is no place to visit.  It's an arm pit full of nasty bars and nastier drinky girls.  You two would have a much better time in Seoul.    I can send you all the links I have for maps and stuff to do in Seoul if you would like.  I second everything crazy angel says.  Lot more to do in Seoul.  I lived in Seoul on the weekends when I was there.  Insa Dong is kool, and yo ucan get everywhere by subway.  HiSeoul website has alot fo information for you.  I really miss Korea|`|hJNwAHccaa	If you want to come see your husband, then get your passport ready, your plane ticket bought, and fly over here.  He should be able to get a room at Casey Lodge before you get here but he has to do it quick because it's always booked up.  If not, there are plenty of hotels off post that are probably cheaper.  He could either go to Dongduchon or Uijongbu to find a hotel...as long as he is on authorized leave and has permission from his Chain of Command to stay off post.    My suggestion is to stay in Seoul.  Most camps are surrounded by a "ville" with lots of clubs and girls that will probably piss you off if you don't make it known that he's YOUR man, not theirs.  Seoul has lots of places to visit and the malls there are HUGE!!  I suggest making sure that you go to Lotte Mall and I'Park mall.  If Korean food is not your fancy, they have lots of American Restaurants there such as Outback Steakhouse, TGIFriday's, Bennigan's, McDonald's, Burger King, Starbucks, Baskin Robbins, etc.  My favorite non-American restaurant is called Palazzo Due in Insa-dong (suburb of Seoul).  It's an awesome Italian restaurant and is way better (and cheaper) than Olive Garden.    Even though Camp Casey is about 30 minutes away from the DMZ, USFK and 8th US Army has opened up Area I for Command Sponsorship, which means that if he would like to stay in Korea for a little while longer, he can apply and bring you here to live with him.  Instead of serving a 1 year tour, he would then serve a 2 year tour.  I see lots of families at Camp Casey when I make my PX run on the weekends.  A lot of Commanders are promoting it because it means that there will be more Soldiers who have longevity within a unit instead of a rapid turn around.

That's why they put the lead jackets over you even for a tooth x-ray.    Why would a parent want to stay in that room while the child is x-rayed?

There is no country they can be let out in that will treat them as returning heroes. Afghanistan appears to remain their mortal enemy.    They can not be turned over to any country friendly to the Taliban to be rearmed for combat again.  So where does one send these people home to? And when do we decide that the war is over? Like the time that Afghanistan stops fighting against us? or when the Taliban stops fighting?|`|BQdXnCcHaa	It's no different, except that the Gitmo residents do not legally need to be treated in the same way as true POWs, as described under the Geneva Code of Conventions. Yet, the US treats them nearly as well as we would uniformed, non-terrorist prisoners when, legally speaking, we could simply execute them.    Again, legally speaking, they will be released upon the end of the war. However, since the Gitmo prisoners did not fight under the Iraqi flag but as terrorists, they do not need to be released until the war against Islamofascism is won.|`|neuprBeGaa	What war?  Congress didn't declare war.  Who's the enemy?  How will we tell when we've won?  If we can't answer any of these questions, then is there any real expectation that they might someday be released?    POWs get certain guarantees - one of which is that they won't be tortured.  The Gitmo detainees got nothing - the Bush Administration didn't even want to let the Red Cross in to check conditions.    Terrorists are criminals.  Treating them as anything else - POWs, detainees, whatever, merely dignifies their goals and tactics.  They are criminals, and should be treated as such. In this country, that means fair trials.|`|3f8HVRGRaa	POW camps and Gitmo are both supposed to follow the Rules of War, but, the latter has never done so and nothing's being done til now while POW camps have too or face trials.|`|V6onK216aa	I am afraid your statement is erroneous, my friend.    1. Congress never declared war  2. The prisoners at Gitmo do not wear a uniform or fight for a specific country (or countries).  3. They are terrorists, not soldiers. Therefore, the army field manual does not apply to them.    In a POW Camp, soldiers are released when there is a cease fire. Since we are not fighting a war against another country, we can legally hold onto the Gitmo prisoners until we deem it is safe for them to be let go.    Only TWO prisoners at Gitmo were water boarded. The media makes it out to be as if every prisoner were "tortured." The water boarding prevented another attack on American soil. Closing Gitmo is a terrible mistake and it will come back to bite us in the behind. Over 50 inmates from Gitmo that we released are back in the front lines of Afghanistan and Iraq. Lastly, these men are terrorists. They want us dead. It's not like we're water boarding some poor Japanese P.O.W. who was drafted in 1944. These men chose this life and want to kill anybody who does not share the same ideology as they do. Let's not pretend that they deserve the same rights as an American Citizen or a P.O.W.|`|4bc1c9d7862281f68503cd3445c1c598aa	POW is exactly that Prisioners of war.  The people in Gitmo are just criminals, not prisioners of war.    PresBO learned this on his first day, and paniced!  He wanted to so badly close Gitmo on day one, but realized he will probably never really be able to close it.  If fact he is holding up trials for the poeple at gitmo, and violating their rights.    Where are the liberals when you need them!|`|bA0sLHnlaa	If they called it a POW camp then they would have to submit to the Geneva convention and give prisoners all the rights entailed.  By labeling them "unlawful combatants" they can hold them indefinitely.  Ironically the US military are "unlawful combatants" in the Iraq war, no official state of war was declared.      The North Vietnamese used this same logic we have at Gitmo when they imprisoned and tortured US POW's in the Vietnam war.   I'm glad we have come so far to be just like our former enemies.
zqPjdhgKaa	Laws on when you can get your license vary state to state.  This question depends upon the state you live in.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	Don't know but congratulations on your progression in becoming an American citizen (if you choose).|`|6nS62bB8aa	The laws change from state to state, so your local Department of Motor Vehicles can help you best.    And thank you for becoming a citizen.
pf8GXvMYaa	Its probably the most fun i had during basic training. Afterwords you will have some of the funniest stories to tell to everyone you know.    Trust me its not soo bad.    My personal story, I had to recite the soldier's Creed with my mask off, it sucked, and I rubbed my eyes why inside the chamber. But its good to get all your mistakes out during basic.|`|hbHUv05Xaa	Even us Squids are exposed to that stuff. I didn't have any problems throwing up but my eyes would not open for almost 5 minutes, it could get worse though, since I've been in the fleet I've already been pepper sprayed (10 times worse than teargas in my opinion)|`|hJNwAHccaa	You walk through the gas chamber with your mask on.  The purpose is to train you on what to expect should a chemical attack happen.  It also teaches you how to clear your mask of any chemical debris.    This is what happens...    You walk in the chamber with your mask.  You do a series of events to test how well your mask fits (moving your head around in circles, doing jumping jacks to test the mobility of your mask, etc).  After a while, they tell you to break your seal.  Yes, you'll inhale CS gas but it's non-lethal.  You then seal the mask to your face again and are required to clear your mask of all the chemicals.  Towards the end, they will line you up towards the exit and have you take your mask completely off.      I'm not going to lie...it stings.  DO NOT WEAR CONTACTS!!  It will make your eyes burn even more!  Yes you will snot, literally cry, drool all over yourself and become nauseous.  I've never seen anyone throw up because we're told not to eat before we go to the chamber but I do see dry heaving because some people panic.  You just gotta stay calm.  It's all completely normal.  If you try to rub the chemicals off, it'll burn even more.  That's why when you exit the chamber, they have you hold your hood and mask out so you don't do this.  If you've ever messed around with pepper spray or mace, it's pretty much the same.  It happens to everybody but it's not like you're going to die from it.  By Army standards, you're supposed to attend the gas chamber bi-annually but most units forget and don't do it at all.    Really...it's not a big deal.|`|bd14bcb63a014dafbf329297cbde4881aa	YES    You are exposed to tear gas|`|SOTzQwJaaa	Oh yeah, and it sucks too.  Your eyes will be burns and all kinds of stuff will be running out of your mouth and nose.  It clears u up with ur sick though lol.|`|kKdUhS2gaa	yes its cs gas its the same stuff in mace,your eyes and nose will run and it kinda hurts when you breath it sucks dude|`|uslsfE1Uaa	I sure won't forget when i did it,if you got a bad cold,it will take care of it!Don't worry you be in and out of it before you know it.|`|8zZFXUGSaa	I loved the gas chamber. It is the best thing in the world for getting rid of any kind of sinus problems. CS attacks the mucus producing organs. This will cause your eyes to slam shut and your nose to run. It will burn your lungs with a fire that you will swear will kill you. DO not touch your face. When you get out, let the fresh air clear you up. Do not shower for at least 1 hour as this will cause the agent to reactivate. A very nasty surprise for those in the shower if you do.|`|zdpgxYyJaa	Yes you do. My fianc went through BCT in the fall of 2007. They did the gas chamber within the first few weeks but I'm not sure if that's the norm. He brought back a video from his BCT and it showed them coming out of the gas chamber. Some people were fine while others threw up. Most had tears or red eyes but it varied greatly soldier to soldier. You have to come out of the chamber a certain way I don't remember exactly but I think it was mask down gun high or something like that. If they didn't then they had to go through again! Hope this helps!|`|rNXCnJ8Eaa	Yeah. I don't think it's as horrible as it sounds. Now I'm not saying it's "pleasant" but you know.    In police academy you have to be pepper sprayed in the eyes too. Just so you know the severity of your weapons and how to properly use them.|`|vKxt1i0Faa	Yes.|`|r6zLN0Daaa	yes|`|gfksposqaa	Yup,  we did it in the Marines, and you have to do it once a year every year you're in, but it's not bad once you're fully in the service, in boot camp they purposely make it h*ll for you, they make you take your mask off in there and see how long you can hold your breath and do jumping jacks and stuff.    Pain is temporary.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	Yes it's true. Every service member attending boot camp irregardless of service has to go into the gas chamber.     I did not cry and i did not throw up. I think my nose ran after I came out, but mostly I just coughed. I can tell you from experience that the gas chamber is much better than being sprayed with OC (mace). I had to get sprayed when I went through the police academy. It was much worse. I certainly felt like crying then.|`|YbXSNgUOaa	I did in spring of 64. Didn't bother me , one troop ran through screen door, having a fit.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	Yes all true.    I do not know if they still do it but when I was in they made us take our masks off and the DI would ask questions. If you did not answer or ran out you went back in.            US Army 79-82    Military Police|`|A90SRsTxaa	Yes. CS gas sux.|`|trMsK86jaa	I would expect so.    Don't worry too much about it though, the majority of the time it'll be the people on your side using the gas.|`|BuGz6eU9aa	yep, and every so often as part of unit training you do again.  the results vary from person to person, but your description is fairly accurate.|`|Gax0IIvOaa	Yes!  The reason is, it is better to learn how to properly don a gas mask in a room full of tear gas then it would be to try and figure it out when someone is using the real stuff.  It is a lesson you will not forget.|`|983da09dc3ea0ef9d60b736fb7da884eaa	you kinda need to see if the gas mask fits so we had to go int wearing it, the set the gas off, then we had to remove the mask in line, say our full names and then we could leave.........    It really helps to know what it is like, so you will NOT be slow about putting the damm thing on IF really needed.
6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Broken Arrow..... Unit about to be overrun.  A Broken Arrow would cause every mission in the air to be diverted in support of the endangered unit.    If you read the book, We Were Soldiers Once, and Young.  Colonel Moore wrote that in the Ia Drang Valley he had missions stacked from 1,000 feet all the way up to 31.000 in support after calling such a code.|`|IfNjgcxGaa	depending on the time of when the article happened it might actually have been Broken Arrow which was called in ONLY when a unit was just about to be over run, it called for all available aircraft in the area to attack the area around the unit and hopefully keep the unit alive long enough to fight on
