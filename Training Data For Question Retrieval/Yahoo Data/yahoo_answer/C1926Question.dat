20090204174145AAeZiPu	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Can someone tell me how I can care about this less?	This may be a form of OCD or just a quirk. For instance I like all my stuff too look nice and clean and scratch free just has to be that way or it drives me mad I take good care of my stuff. So I want some ways to not let this bother me mostly here is an example my ipod touch as you know the back scratches easily very very easily and mine has very hardly viewable scratches barely visible and there is just a few. That drives me crazy I can't get over that they are there. I bought a case just to slide it in to go in my pocket but when I use it nothing is on it. I don't wanna by an invisible shield for the back because I dont wanna use that money because I don't scratch it, the scratches get there if sometimes I let my friends see it if they ask, like a girl uses it and they have finger nails usually that scratches so I dont wanna buy a invisible shield if I don't scratch it. The scratches drive me mad, I wanna get better at this. Do you know anyway I can not let scratches or super neatness of things bother me, especially on this ipod the scratches bother me so much I can hardly enjoy the ipod.

Ho una macchinetta digitale della Pentax (Optio 430RS), ottima sotto ogni punto di vista ma da un po' presentava dei problemi tipo:      1)      Si spegneva subito (pur se con la batteria carica) al primo tentativo di far una foto      2) ora, accendendola, estrae l'obiettivo ma subito fa un rumore (tipo un motorino che gira) e si richiude spegnendosi.      Ci sono passato già con una precedente Digicam (sempre Pentax) e ... non so se valga la pena provare a farla riparare. Mi costò intorno ai 600 € quando uscì e vorrei non doverla buttare.
