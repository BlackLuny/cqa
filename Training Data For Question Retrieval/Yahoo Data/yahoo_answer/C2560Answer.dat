However, I think it's a Honda thing.. our Accord, Civic and Acura MDX all have the same buttons, and none of them have backlights.|`|W0K9QqEDaa	I have an odessey and I found out that it might be a fuse...if the fuse that works these functions is fine, it absolutley could be a bulb. Good luck.|`|vOTuecfEaa	The back lights come on with the light switch. I have been replacing a number of these bulbs recently. Honda went to a much smaller bulb and they do not seem to last and naturally they are quite expensive for such a small bulb.

The answers are yes, and yes.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Maybe they're gritted to help the car sales industry by making everyone's cars go rusty.    When the icy weather's finished, use a jetwash to get all the salt from under your car and in the wheel arches.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Yes in my area they have been.

mKVFIklaaa	No problem. Your car is rated to tow 2000kgs. The caravan weighs around 1100-1200kgs.|`|k6IFEGYzaa	Should be ok but the rule that all caravan clubs use is that the laden weight of the caravan should never exceed the unladen weight of the towcar and ideally should be 80-90%. Your car handbook should give the car weight and the caravan should have a weight plate on it somewhere.   You may find that your car is rated to tow a much higher weight than this but believe me towing a van which weighs more than the car at 60mph can easily get you into a "tail  wagging dog" situation.

EDnT0y8caa	The airlines do not care what field your degree is in as long as you have one. The majority of airline companies screen applications using a computer scoring system that only looks at the number of years of college you have attended and what level of degree you received. No "extra points" are awarded for having an aviation-related degree.  As long as you have some kind of a degree it shows that you have some brains, that you are probably trainable and can pass exams, and that you are likely to stick to a training program until it is completed.  Some airlines actually like their pilots to have a diversity of education, skills and interests outside aviation, so as far as what to take in college, study a subject you will enjoy that might also employ you if a flying career doesn't work out.|`|OwAE70I5aa	any best raf|`|fd093fbfa4f1677838f60a723cd1f777aa	The degree is not of critical importance. I don't know that many, if any, care what specifically your degree is in. They do like to see flight experience however. Fly as much as often as you can. Don't fudge your logbooks - that's a hanging offense.   The military is another great way to open an avenue to a career in aviation. My recommendation however, is to have a backup plan. If you become an airline pilot, you will be laid off, your airline will likely be bought, sold, dissolved or go bankrupt, and a variety of other things that will always keep your career on shaky ground. Get a degree that you can use outside of the airline industry if your airline dreams fail - many of my friends had their dreams come apart twice and three times. Have a backup plan.|`|h7FRdWhBaa	My dad's a pilot (in the RAF), but he's moving to commerical airlines.    He took mechanical engineering for a degree.
teAtI3Itaa	look good at vac. hoses especially pcv hose|`|wEaYAcrBaa	Worn out motor mounts, crankshaft pulley separating can cause a vibration at idle. If only at idle when warm (lower RPM) and worse with air conditioner on and in gear (auto) it might be a vibration (dash shakes and you can hear things rattling), there was a TSB for this concern that is now expired. It involves some (or all) of these items depending on year and if auto or manual. Motor mounts, radiator mounts, hood adjustment, securing front bumper cover, neutralizing exhaust system, etc. If the vehicle has NOT had a frontal collision a dealer can tell pretty quickly if this procedure needs performed. Depending on year and transmission the procedure can cost $1,000.00 or more, it is a time consuming repair. The TSB can totally take care of the vibration, help with the vibration or not make much difference at all. If it has had a frontal collision and the mounts were replaced, (or had motor mounts replaced due to age and worn out) the front motor mount (radiator side) can be installed backwards and this will cause the same concern. Taking to a dealer would be your best bet for proper diagnosis.|`|QcW2eXnOaa	no error codes?|`|9eouWphjaa	Might wanna see if its misfiring that could result in rough idle.

vD4lx7s0aa	read your tire and keep it 2 to 3 lbs under what max says.  Remember as your driving the tire heats up and so does the air inside the tire.  When that happens your tires expand so always read your tire psi carefully so that you will never over fill and pop your tire
OmJmRmNtaa	It will say on the tire sidewall and the door jamb tag. I set them @ 35 psi|`|pYa8ft5Oaa	The max' tire pressure will be on the sidewall of your tire.  To go further, check with a reputable tire dealer.  35psi is typical under normal conditions.  If adding a load, check pressure after load is on the vehicle-35psi is where you should be.
AA12339318	If the law says that a bicycle should follow the road rules like a motor vehicle, then that is the law.    You MUST be aware that there are automobile drivers that also don't stop for stop signs, don't signal turns or lane changes or stay in their proper lanes.    People make mistakes, or are careless, or just don't believe certain rules apply to them.  Bicyclists are no different.  If you had hit her, and it was determined that there was no way you could have avoided hitting her, you would not be cited or charged.  If it were determined that you COULD have avoided the collision and didn't bother (like for no better reason than that you  had the right of way) then you could have been charged.  If the bicylist had died because of this, the charge COULD be manslaughter.    Remember, a pedestrian does NOT have the right to step in front of a speeding car, no matter WHO had the right of way.|`|oBmLIDHtaa	Bicycles are supposed to follow the rules of the road - if the bicyclist ran the stop sign and got hit, then they were at fault (hopefully you would have a witness though, because it would be your word against theirs (if you didn''t kill them).    The fact is, cars and bikes (i ride both a bicycle and a motorcycle) can share the road - but there are a lot of rude and obnoxious drivers (even when you are in a car) who aren't paying attention - talking on their cell phones (texting on their cell phones too), putting on makeup, eating, etc. - I have had a lot of them damn near run me down while on two wheels.    There are a lot of considerate drivers too - many of whom ride themselves, I always try to give bicycles and motorcycles plenty of room, and I always watch for unexpected stuff like what you described.    There are some rude bicyclists too - but at the same time, if they want to stay in one piece, they will watch the hell out for cars.|`|AA11185391	They should equal opportunity to be ran over as much as a person walking.

AA10620246	I'd go with the blue one. It has a more powerful engine, and an automatic transmission. Plus, it has fewer miles on it.     The only negative thing I can say about the blue one is that with an in-line 6 cylinder engine, and an automatic transmission, it wouldn't get the gas mileage that the red one would get.

If these are faulty in some way the oil would burn blue smoke, also the oil pressure fluctuation is a sign of these seals having problems..

b3hGPUGXaa	No it is people who still by Fords, Chrysler's and Chevrolet's who are un American. These are companies which make junk cars, sell them at inflated prices, and then steal from the American taxpayer. In order for our economic system to work a consumer has a responsibility to buy the best product at the lowest price. Buying an American made car does not meet this requirement. It just makes a person look stupid. Every time I see a poor soul in an American made car I think to myself they are either naive or just plain stupid. They could buy a Toyota which will last forever or buy a Ford that is lucky to last one year and they bought the Ford. Makes a lot os sense. Then these same American auto companies have the nerve to beg the gov't for a bailout. Well I say starting now it is ANTI AMERICAN to buy from any company which steals from the American taxpayer. Enough is enough. Buy a Toyota!!!<br>  When you do buy a car make sure it is made in Japan. Do not understand why Toyota thinks it is good business since to devalue their cars by have them made in the US. Please note most if not all Prius's are made in Japan.

They've got a lot of catchin' up to do if they ever want to come close to the reputations of manufacturers like Toyota, Honda, etc..etc..  They can't blame the consumer for the plant closings and job loses just because they want something that's going to last and for the manufacturer to stand behind when something does go wrong!

You will have a lot more fun with it and Ford Automatics aren't very well made. Manual's have no "Auto" parts that can break and are much more durable. Its cheaper to get a new clutch every 75,000 miles at $500 with labor and parts than replacing an Automatic at 100,000 miles for $2,000 plus $500 for labor. There is alot less parts to break on a manual. The only thing that happens to a manual is a bad clutch or a syncronizer may grind at high miles from wear but still perfectly useable. You will also get used to the manual very fast when you first get it. It's worth the wait. Look on craigslist.org in the area's around where you live.

Stick works for places where theres curvy roads, few people, lots of opportunities to shift and appreciate the shifting. If your daily commute to work/school consists of getting on the highway, keeping constant speed, getting off, and stopping, then there's little reason for a stick to begin with. And again, like I said, if there's traffic, you'll just make your left foot tired from the clutch.|`|gyixPyOsaa	stick and the best reason for it other than the mustang will be better for racing by being able to manually switch gears is you can push start a stick if it dies. u put it in neutral and push start it. all you do is let out the clutch. its really handy if you get in a bind and don't have any jumper cables.|`|ECLYzIXZaa	A stick is a more fun.Don't let people tell you to get an automatic because you are inexperienced.My first car was a stick and I took to it like a duck to water,and you will also.Have fun and be safe.|`|b81651b3e653a6354f1a8d2bcbdec23aaa	Get the auto, cause if you ever get a girlfriend who wants to be naughty while you're driving, the shifting will ruin everything.|`|rtcubrgtaa	automatic.<br>  i hate the stick it gets me carsick lol but thats just mee<br>  if you only have little expierience & this is guna be ur first car then maybe you should get automatic til you get used to stick|`|DvnEJenpaa	AUTO<br>  <br>  stick will be annoying to have to deal with<br>  <br>  if you want to get a stick however, i suggest that you get it on your second or third car, once you've had ample driving opportunity<br>  <br>  but i think auto is best for you starting out on your own as a driver.|`|JXTdMa3maa	Chicks dig the stick.<br>  <br>  Driving sticks make you a more well-rounded person. Let's say you're a party, your friend has had way to much to drink, on the verge of alcohol poison and you have to drive his car which is a stick shift. And oh no you drive your mom's minivan which is auto.|`|KYFro7cZaa	If this is your first car then you should seriously consider getting something besides a Mustang. Younger drivers have a tendancy to have minor accidents (dingers) that will ruin the resale value of a car very quickly. Get some old used car that has a good engine, and nothing to worry about in the looks department. You'll be thankful later! For example, with a factory new Mustang that you have payments on your insurance is going to be outrageous. On the other hand, you can get a really nice used car for $3000, your insurance costs will be lower, you might be able to avoid payments, and if you wreck it then you haven't lost a massively expensive car and all the money you've had to put into it. If you do decide to go with the used car option then I'd also recommend that you familurize yourself with your local used car laws, negotiating, and have a mechanic check it out before you buy. Also, screw worrying about the color. If it's that important to you then the car can be repainted.<br>  <br>  As far as the automatic/manual transmission issue is concerned: get an automatic. As a new driver, a stick would be an added distraction that can easily be avoided, and you'll be able to focus more of your attention on your driving. There are advantages and disadvanges with either option, so I'll try to go over a few of them with you.<br>  <br>  With an automatic, you just shift and go. Beyond that you don't have to worry about what gear you're in until you're ready to park or reverse. Also, when you park an automatic it's not so critical that you remember to set your parking brake or put the engine in a specific gear. Lastly, you can do most of the same things with an automatic transmission that you can do with a manual.<br>  <br>  With manual transmissions you will get better fuel milage, but it's not really worth worrying about too much. You'd have more control over the vehicle, but the learning curve can be rather steep for some.<br>  <br>  As for the downsides with manual transmissions are concerned, there are some things you can do with them that are highly irresponsible, and it might be best to just get an automatic for the sake of keeping yourself out of trouble.|`|DXotNZ9eaa	For real im not much of a car dude or anything, You should get the one with the letters P R N D L 2 or something like it im guess the stick but just a guess. The one with like 4 numbers ehhh i think not lol. You decide and sounds like u want the stick more than auto so go for the stick.|`|0w8EmVjTaa	If you are gonna get a sports car you have to get a stick its just wrong not to. Why don't you just get a V8? If your not gonna get a stick you should just get a regular car. Get a jeep. I love jeeps. They last forever and there great in the snow or off road.|`|iut8UXVtaa	If you get a stick your always gona have one hand on the wheel and the other on the shifter. Just think of all the other things you could be doing if you had an auto and your hand was free! (usually their will be a girl in the passenger seat!)|`|iGbtugJlaa	Well, stick shift saves gas, which you would want right now, but if you want an easy drive, I would go for Auto. Stick is nice on some ways and if your use to it, it can be as smooth as an auto. Its just nice to have 1 hand free if your using auto|`|i16XRTEBaa	id go with stick. they get better fuel economy and are less likely to break rather then an automatic trans and for a first car your going to want to save as much money as possible|`|jBYa3FcGaa	Highly recommend stick myself - especially for a muscle car.<br>  <br>  Your friend,<br>  Zen Jesus|`|ylAEO8CGaa	first off, a V6 mustang is not a sports car..so you better off getting auto..if you get some real power than get manual|`|larI0lCgaa	with it being your 1st car, you shud probably go with the auto transmission in case anything happens|`|L5ie6msYaa	stick = faster more fuel efficient, fun.

Blaiv8Duaa	i love the new a4. it looks awesome with the leds and curves. i think they did a great job if i had the money it would for sure be a high contender and yes i do like the s line version.|`|vWsElUtGaa	I think they are great cars with a great look. I own a Audi A4 B7 2.0T and wouldn't trade it for just about anything. As far as the other person posted of course i would take a BMW M3 or BENZ AMG, there are not the same class $30,000 to $50,000 diffrence. But I would take an Audi RS4 or Audi R8 over the BMW and BENZ any day.|`|e633f0ecda1f58c2c866bf034a9377eaaa	Used to drive a 99 A4 and I loved that car.<br>  The new A4 S line looks like a hell of a car, just be prepared for a bit of add-on price shock, add drive select, navigation and the no brainer (more airbags) and you've just added over 20k to the base model.|`|L4AnlPzvaa	I prefer the previous generation, but I also said that when the 2005.5's came out.  I'm not too sure on the LED lighting.  Looks good and is definitely different.  We'll see if it catches on?<br>  <br>  And how can you even compare an A4 with an AMG or a M-series?|`|pMIQBm1Oaa	yes i think it a beautiful car but i would still rather buy a Mercedes AMG or a bmw m3. Although i really think the led headlights look awesome
mLlQC92Laa	P0133 is a slow responding O2 sensor.....O2 sensors have a life expectancy of 100K miles depending on driving habits and other conditons....This code is due to a O2 sensor failing....I would change the O2 and doing and a fuel injector service and or tune up if need be would not hurt if the car  has not had a complete tune-up......but ultimately the O2 should be changed because the code is for a failing O2 not a vacuum leak or fuel system issue....although both can cause an O2 to prematurely fail...... I would get an A/C delco or a bosch O2 sensor not a universal O2......the cheap universal  O2 sensor are not good and will not last....spend the extra money and get a quality O2 or you'll be buying another cheap one in 6 months if you don't......pay now or pay later....;)|`|AA10789216	Slow oxygen sensor response is typical when oxygen sensors get old.  I'd go with a new O2 sensor on this one.  But you can double check the waveforms with a scan tool to be sure.  <br>  <br>  The O2 sensor measures the amount of oxygen in the exhaust.  If there is too much in the exhaust, the car is running too lean.  If there's no oxygen in the exhaust, the car is running too rich.  <br>  <br>  You can get the O2 sensor at an auto parts store.  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't do anything to the fuel system with this code.|`|ZR8wgt6vaa	Check for vacuum leak first.|`|KZCQWkfQaa	This code is telling you that your car is running to lean/rich. This could be caused by a false reading from the o2 sensor meaning it is bad or it could be a bad catalytic converter. It also mentions the fuel system because it could be caused by a bad injector or fuel filter. Given the year of your car im going to lean towards a bad 02 sensor or bad fuel filter. Filter is a couple bucks so i would try that first. If nothing i would try the 02 sensor. Remember that when you change something you either need to have the codes cleared or you need to pull off the battery for 10 minutes to reset the check engine light. Best price is probably going to be at autozone or ebay.
6Gfz125Paa	It depends.  The larger ones, such as the LA MTA, actually have quite elaborate models and they keep track of ridership on each route and all.  They also have public meetings once in a way for people to give their input, and every once in a while they have public surveys.  Smaller agencies might do it more informally.|`|G5B2Dx2Zaa	There was an express bus that I used to ride from near my home to work.  Because ridership on that route was low, the company decided to discontinue it.  There was a Community meeting held in the area affected by that bus where we were able to speak to a representative from the bus company as well as the City council member for the area.  Despite our pleas, they discontinued the route and combined it with another route that went nearby.<br>  <br>  There are frequent changes to stops and routes with our bus system.  Complaints, traffic accidents and school schedules are all reasons given for the changes made.<br>  <br>  So, they use current ridership and traffic flow data as well as comments from the community.  If your public transportation system is subsidized by the government, you can also speak to your representative or the Department of Transportation.
ND1nFEWSaa	only two reasons........<br>  <br>  one    / bad or defective store battery<br>  two       / something is useing voltage from your car when parked,<br>  <br>  Quick tip or suggestion,  after driving, park the truck, loosen the battery terminal but just enough so you can replace it quickly and it will still be tight enougn to start.<br>  leave the terminal off overnite and/or for 2 days, then only hook it up when you need the truck, and see if after those two days it starts,<br>  If it does, the truck has a short problem<br>  <br>  Fords and chrysler do this more often;<br>  hook up battery, remove the NEGATIVE terminal and clip on a test light to the terminal and the other part to ground, with the drivers door closed , ignition off, see if the tester light goes on, if it does, there is definately  a short, leave the light st up connected so the light stays on, get help for someone else to watch this light as you;...remove each individual fuse from the fuse box one by one watching the light to go out, doing this your are disconnecting each electric component one at the time to isolate the bad one. <br>  This is what an electric auto place does, if none of the fuses pulled out turns off the light, it is something else,<br>  Disconnect the power going to the alternator unplug the plugs and look for a looped wire with a 3/8ths nut also to remove, check the light, still on? we just checked the alternator, sometimes an alternator can be working but broken in a way to draw 12 volts from the battery<br>  this is all you can do.<br>  <br>  Last alternative if you do not want to go to an expensive auto electric shop is to disconnect the cable on the battery every time or for 20 dollars you can buy a shut off switch<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  jon|`|KZCQWkfQaa	You obviously have some kind of a draw. If the problem started after the alternator was put in it could be because it was hooked up wrong. The alternator has to be turned on to start making power. The way it is turned on is from a key on power. Alot of first time alternator installers will just run a jumper wire from the acc post to the key on post which would make it slowly drain the battery. It would work fine if you started it all the time.|`|2JrnfNPZaa	You might want to check for a short somewhere. I had a similar problem and found that was the case.|`|0DdSoi4Maa	Probably b/c it's a Ford, I'd go with Chevy.

gGBPPjLeaa	Umm youve asked about loss of power light adn service traction system light take it to a shop already, either there are multiple problems or the PCM is fried,|`|uwRkw4vmaa	The Traction Control System is a integral part of the ABS Braking system on the car, and I am surprised you didn't mention that light also, but I suppose there are parts of one that would not effect the other.  To the point, you need to have the codes read and diagnosed by somebody with a scan tool and the ability to pinpoint test the actual cause of the Trouble Code generated.  Please don't be fooled by the parts store that says they can tell you what is wrong for free.  They may get lucky and tell you, for instance that a wheel speed sensor is bad, they can even tell you which one it is.  What they can't tell is if the wires are broke or the speed sensor is the actual culprit.  Wheel sensors that are incorporated into the bearings can run as much as 300.00 dollars, and another 100.00 by the time it is installed, only to find out you needed to, or still need to repair wiring and spend more to fix the real problem, just a bit of advice.  The Traction Control System when working correctly reduces or eliminates tire spin by detecting when a wheel is detected at more speed than the other 3, and then the ABS pump applies brakes at that wheel position.

NZvYP7Q2aa	I've had one for three years and still love it.  I haven't had any maintenance or repair issues and it is not expensive to fix like a BMW or Mercedes anyway.  The car is quick so if you stomp the gas every time you start off you will definitely get less MPG.  It also depends on your drive - hills, highway, etc. - and you do have to use premium gas.  If you don't have an issue with only having a two seater then I highly recommend it.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	They average 22MPG depending on how you drive and they REQUIRE PREMIUM FUEL.<br>  <br>  They are also expensive to maintain, only seat 2 people, and have very little trunk space. And they are RWD so they are slippery in rain and impossible to drive in snow or sand.<br>  <br>  But they are reliable, fun, and very fast cars.|`|2kR4sX48aa	gas consumption depends on how you drive it.<br>  <br>  you know its only a 2 seater right?|`|AA10305113	A 350z is not only a 2 seater like little kids previously mentioned, and id does depend on the way you drive but not entirely. the car i heavy and has a 3.5L engine. you will get like 21mpg city at most.|`|H9wH2AD4aa	they are PIMP
NvCPwSGPaa	You have to track down the old owner or go to AL DMV and see what they have to say.  Most likely more hassle than its worth.  You would be better off buying a cheap car/van that has not been parked for that long.  Things will constantly need to be replaced and fixed once you start driving it more.  Go to craigslist.org and find a good cheap car, there are a lot out there right now.  I go a great little Saturn off craigslist for 1k and it is in perfect condition no TLC needed.
8GDBr2U9aa	No. The owner of the damaged vehicle decides where to get the vehicle repaired, not the at-fault driver.|`|sQsw8Rykaa	no you get to choose the shop or the insurance would give you a list of where can you take it.|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	you should choose, as long it is reasonable

gyixPyOsaa	its a ramp that gradually helps the semi truck drivers to stop safely when their breaks go|`|E0j6mhqhaa	Rather than copying some stuff like the first person, I'll explain it better.  In steep mountainous areas,the brakes on large heavily loaded vehicles can become overheated and then fail to work on long downhill runs.  The ramp is usually located on a curve of the downhill road.  The road curves right or left and the ramp continues straight and up a steep hill.  The ramp is an excavated trench filled with loose, round, smooth river rock.  When the runaway truck enters the ramp, the effect is the same as when you try to walk through deep snow or in deep water in a swimming pool, substantial yet gradual resistance.  This brings the truck to a safe halt with no assistance from the brakes.  <br>  <br>  Whatever you do, you don't want to mistake a ramp for a place to pull off to take a photo because once you're in the loose gravel, you'll need a tow truck to get you out.|`|BMfQ0KMtaa	Truck Escape Ramps: Determining the Need and the Location<br>  <br>  Truck escape ramps have been part of our highway system for well over 30 years.

WO68RZdIaa	Several factors will play into this. <br>  If you are going to college in another state, you could very well be facing having the car impounded for no insurance, an expired registration & also receive a citation for each once all that comes to light after the officer pulls you over for an expired registration & starts checking the status of your driver's license & insurance. This will especially be possible if you are in another state when you get stopped.<br>  <br>  These fines are not cheap, & will add points to your license. If the car gets impounded- it won't take long for the total cost of the impound fees to reach $1000 or more after the towing fee, daily storage fees, etc are all added up. Add those costs to your fines & court costs, & you may have problems affording your next semester's tuition.|`|71133c5b27fbdaa8629cfbb5dafa77afaa	well depending on your state laws the car could be impounded. myself i'd rather miss some classes than deal with the hefty fines, possibly jail time, and possibly impounded car. but hey thats just me.|`|1O6Yh1esaa	Unless you're in an accident there's no way for them to know you're driving an uninsured car.

Piaggio and Vespa are rated the best but they cost a lot. Then Kymco they are rated higher than all of the Jap scooters and are far better. With new any problems the warranty takes care of . Kymco's are not Chinese imports but are quality reliable rides. They have more carrying capacity than most motorcycles built right in. What ever you get stay  away from sport bikes they tend to be abused when sold. I read what people write and the Jap four are riding on their name from back in the day.
Z13CWyNGaa	Well lets just assume there is nothing mechanically wrong. Engine runs and holds coolant and oil, same for the transmission. Bumper maybe $300 tops. Hood maybe another $300. Paint $500 minimum I'd say. Lights and motors maybe somewhere between $300 to $600. And the big one, structural damage, the car could be twisted, or have on side pushed back (like a parallelogram), maybe $2500? And then of course other small stuff like alignment ($70) and cost of inspection ($150).<br>  <br>  I'd say your looking at $4000-$6000 dollars worth of damage, or just $1000-$1500 if there is no structural damage...|`|ND1nFEWSaa	considering the mileage, year make and model and in above average condition ,IF IT WAS  all fixed with the history of a collision, it would be worth<br>  $ 4500.00 tops!<br>  <br>  paying someone to fix this parts and labor my good guess $3900 to 4600<br>  <br>  this is a parts vehicle, bad purchase for 1800|`|s8cZsSX0aa	That is definately over 6k worth of damage.

KQhIcU4Yaa	Deep cycle batteries should never be run down completely.  This will ruin them very quickly.  They work best if never discharged below 1/4.  Recharging when it is 2/3 charged is perfectly fine.  This is actually good for the battery<br>  <br>  A battery will explode if not connected properly to the charger.  Read the directions on the charger or get someone to show you how.  They contain sulfuric acid and will cause you serious harm if they explode.<br>  <br>  You should have a battery box to prevent any acid from leaking out onto carpets, etc.  By US Coast Guard law you need to have the battery in a secure battery box to use it on a boat.|`|YLajQcFkaa	No you can recharge it anytime. Deep cycles are designed to be mostly discharged before charging but noting is wrong with charging it anytime. No don't charge on a carpet if you like that carpet.  The battery can leak acid on the carpet so make sure your charging where your not worried about damage or unsightly marks.  Yes batteries can explode since they emit hydrogen when being charged.  Its rare but it does happen.  Make sure the charger is off when unhooking a battery.

On top of that, any vehicle that was neglected or abused to the point that the driveshaft/Ujoint broke will probably have lots of other problems down the road. <br>  <br>  If you do buy it, make sure you have some other car for when this is getting fixed.
EooU3QGnaa	We just had a two day yard sale and the 02 Altima with the 6 in it wouldn't start. Apparently some of the electric controls need a full 12 vts to work properly.

X0AVSeNmaa	This question came up a few years back when our local government decided to change the law for teen drivers. There are a great many factors that affect teen driver crash and fatality statistics, but the question was specific in asking what time of day the crashes occur. <br>  <br>  The answer is that teens are most likely to crash between 9pm and midnight. Most teens are not out driving after midnight on weekdays.<br>  <br>  The after-nine driving is mostly recreational driving and it tends to include teen passengers, which can be a distraction especially if they are showing off or acting silly. Teen drivers are not notorious for DUI, but even a little alcohol can dramatically affect a teen's driving ability, so many of these late evening crashes involve at least some alcohol. <br>  <br>  Some contributing factors that we see recurring are: <br>  <br>  An exhausted or sleep-deprived teen driver (tired from a big week of sports or testing)<br>  An attitude of celebration, (cut loose a little after the big game)<br>  Friends in the car <br>  Some alcohol (teen drivers are seldom drunk, but alcohol affects teens differently than adults)<br>  Late evening driving<br>  Risk-taking behavior such as speeding, no seat belts, showing off <br>  Lack of experience (You are a beginner for the first 5 years)<br>  <br>  <br>  Experienced adult drivers are far more likely to be drunk after 9pm as well, so there are many reasons for teens to be extra-careful at night.<br>  Many states now have laws to restrict late-night teen driving and most of these laws include restrictions on teen passengers. These laws will likely cause the statistics to change over time as the laws target the riskiest situations.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Well running all the numbers its all times of the day.

Your taxes & tags can be included in the payment.  The monthly payment can be around what you would pay on a buy for 60 months (but remember it includes taxes & only for shorter terms). At the end of the lease you have the option of turning the car in & not owe anything (if you follow the terms of the lease) or exercising your option to purchase the car (price is set a start of lease).  It can be attractive if you like to get a new car every few years, don't want to be faced with repairs, don't want to be upside down on your car, etc.<br>  Buying you have to pay all the sales tax up front, tags & personal property tax each year.

JNvjPoCSaa	Unfortunately it sounds as if your new problem was caused by the new fuel pump ~ sending unit assembly. This is not a surprise; I and many other mechanics have had that exact problem with the occasional new pump.<br>  <br>  However, that does not address the beginning of your problem; fuel gauge inoperative.<br>  <br>  The first place I would look is the wiring harness from the fuel pump to firewall. I have personally rewired many that have simply been eaten by mice, rabbits, dogs, etc., and with any luck you will find something. However if not, the service manual would instruct you to first perform an IPC module (instrument panel cluster) system check. You would need a scan tool to perform that task, accurately.  <br>  <br>  The IPC produces the low fuel command however it receives fuel level readings from the VCM/PCM (Vehicle Control Module/Powertrain Control Module), and then obviously from the fuel sending unit. <br>  <br>  I think it is safe to say the problem was not the sending unit.<br>  <br>  Without using a scanner, we cannot properly test the modules nor should we assume any of them are faulty (they are pricey if I recall right).<br>  <br>  <br>  toad|`|LX0vjwXPaa	Did YOU change out the pump/gauge/filter?  If so, did you flush the entire tank?  Also, was it ever intermittently out, or has it always been pegged low?  Any changes that happened around the same time?  GM gas gauges have lots of problems, one of which is built up "crud" on the sending unit.  It can happen with few miles, or after a long time.  I have it on both my Vette and my Suburban, I usually just run some fuel cleaner through my tank and it goes away for a while.
daw140ceaa	Certainly, you can bridge the amp to both subs.  You'll need to wire them in a series/parallel configuration so that you'll end up with a 4-ohm load at the amp.  Follow this diagram:<br>  <a href="http://mobile.jlaudio.com/graphics/Support/Tutorials/wiring_images/DVC_Series_2.gif" rel="nofollow">http://mobile.jlaudio.com/graphics/Suppo...</a><br>  <br>  2 ohm loads are fine in stereo mode, but in bridged mode you don't want to go lower than 4 ohms.<br>  <br>  You probably won't notice much different from the way you have it now, however.  Either way, each sub gets 300 watts (assuming your subs' voice coils are currently wired in parallel).  Technically you're better off running multiple subs from a mono output, so they're both playing exactly the same signal; but in practice, I doubt it will make much difference.|`|HXvX20XAaa	Mono amps are usually a better choice for big subs. Your subs are dual 4 ohms which can be run at 1 ohm. Youd be better off getting an amp thats mono and 1 ohm stable to actually push those subs. As far as bridging your amp on those subs you cant. Check out crutchfield.com and look up your set up (2 dvc 4ohms on 2 channel amp.) The only way to run it is the way you have it. Go mono one ohm stable and you wont go wrong. Good luck|`|f349a8a84f3da84a716aa0eb53c91af1aa	Two Type R's can either run at 1 ohm load or 4 ohm load. Wire the subwoofers in series, and then bridge the amplifier, and you'll be set.

DyEIc0K8aa	I have a 2003 Tiburon (bough new) and find it a long way from junk. Never had a major problem... the most money I spent on it is timing belt, tires and a battery... money you would spend on any car. For the size engine it is fast (I didn't say the fastest thing on the road) and get not all bad gas millage, 24 ro 29 MPH depending on how fast I am driving and where. I have a lot of miles on it at 80 MPH, do not baby it and still does not use oil. At this point I see no reason to think I cannot put 150 to 200,000 miles on the car without a lot of major problems (same as any other car) This car is not my major transportation and will not hesitate to park it or junk it if I believe it to to unsafe. I would buy the car again if to do over. People who run them down are Hyundai haters or don't take care of their cars as I own 2 Hyundai cars and have found them to be the best cars I have ever owned. (Paid cash for them so I can and will buy what I want... anyone who do not believe they are paid for.. put your money where your mouth is and I'll show you the titles)|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	Tiburon. In this example the Civic doesn't even compare to the Tib in features and power, and the Tib is actually a very underrated and underestimated car. Certainly the best Korea has come up with. And 132,000 isn't really much on any car. The Tib could go at least 300,000 I'd say.<br>  <br>  EDIT: This is also coming from a Hyundai hater, but unlike salt life I'm not being biased. There are hundreds of better cars than either the Tib or Civic, but in this comparison the Tiburon undoubtedly wins.|`|94d1acf25e2af629b7eb957530024002aa	Do you have the means to get something better?<br>  <br>  A six years old Korean car with above-average mileage likely to be a lemon. If it is a lemon, you are going to be de-moralised and frustrated when it mostly break down whenever you need to hurry to any appointments<br>  <br>  The reason it is design with more power, is it lost power too quickly and too soon. Worst, breakdown often, so not much power left, except your youthful power|`|QdzecSwdaa	I personally would pick the civic!!  If someone bought me a Tiburon I would not drive it, they are complete garbage.  I work with a guy who has one and all he does is pump money into it to fix it and he just drives it to work and back.  I can imagine that you as a new driver are just going to drive it like your mom and dad bought it and destroy the damn thing, so go with the civic.

In fact today's Hyundai's can last well into 200,000 miles or higher with proper maintenance just like with any car.<br>  Just for the record Honda's do not last forever like many people would lead you to believe <a href="http://www.hondaproblems.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hondaproblems.com/</a><br>  <br>  Just like with any used car try to get the car's history, run a Carfax and have a shop or mechanic look at it.

For daily driving you wouldn't really be going past 4k RPM anyway so what's the problem?|`|1bobsT4Kaa	Your car should rev higher, an I am pretty sure its the ecu, my friend had the same problem. Try to get an ecu around the same years as yours if you can an test it out. If your not sure were the ecu is, its on the passanger side inside the car, where their feet would go. Its bolted to the side by the outside of the car under the carpet. Just take the carpet back a little an you'll see it. Hopefully my explaination isn't confusing. but if that works just look online or a recycler for the ecu. Dont pay more then 75-100 cause thats way to much. but good luck!

Como no tengo horario de salida me conviene traer coche, al final es más acequible que andarse moviendo en transporte sobre todo si andas mucho en la calle o vas lejos o tus horarios no son accesibles. <br>  El costo se prorratea, ya que no siempre tienes imprevistos como descomposturas etc...<br>  Hice la cuenta alguna vez entre lo que me sale venir en transporte y lo que gasto en coche por semana y sale 10 pesos mas caro venir en coche, pero haces 30 minutos menos y no caminas tanto.<br>  Aunque he de decirte que el coche representa un gasto del 20% total de mis egresos mensuales.<br>  Habrá a quienes no les convenga.|`|0ae4ad01a7a23adea0ff7ff862d100bcaa	Hola<br>  Depende musho de la zona y horario en donde estes, por ejemplo si estas en una cuidad grande como guadalajara, te conviene para trasladarte mas rapido y economisar en gasolina, siempre y cuando no abuses de el, y si vives en el df, pues ademas de correr mushos riesgos, y del trafico, vas con la ventaja de llegar mas rapido.

El factor de riesgo de los autos color azul, gris, amarillo y rojo se encuentra en el rango medio. En la actualidad, todos los días mueren alrededor de 3 mil personas en accidentes de tránsito.<br>  <br>  Cerca de la mitad de los conductores analizados por este estudio, se vieron involucrados en accidentes en donde uno o más de los ocupantes fue al hospital o murió mientras que la otra mitad jamás estuvo en un choque y sirvió únicamente como grupo de control. <br>  <br>  Incluso tomando en cuenta factores externos como: condiciones del vehículo y la carretera, género, edad del conductor o el hecho de haber consumido drogas o alcohol, el color del automóvil sigue teniendo directa repercusión en un accidente según este estudio neozelandés.|`|tOjDFubpaa	De acuerdo a un estudio estadounidense se demostró que el gris es el color de coche que choca menos esto es debido a diversas causas, por ejemplo a que el gris tiene mayor visibilidad y es elegido por gente madura que maneja prudentemente. <br>  Un color peligroso es el rojo.

RWjvcCYoaa	Out of all the cars you mentioned, the Subaru will be the best car in the snow. Having all wheel drive puts it far ahead of the other cars. AWD gives it superior handling in snow and rain. You have much better control. Second choice is the Matrix. It has front wheel drive and sits higher off the ground then the Mazdas and Nissan.<br>  <br>  The rule to use when considering a car for snow is:<br>  Rear wheel drive -- forget it!<br>  Front wheel drive -- a good possibility<br>  All wheel drive -- get it!|`|aa9gieAIaa	personally i recommend buying an older Japanese car for less money for a first car. they run as well and get the same milage as new ones all in all. even a 90s vintage car with some miles on it can be fixed up to be very reliable like a newer one but you will need to learn good maintenance and get it fixed up beforehand often. Japanese front wheel drive cars are good in snow provided you have good tires. new and old the subaru is a good car i think. don't know much about the other models. i like the older subaru legacy. good luck|`|LX0vjwXPaa	For that price range, you're probably not going to find any of those without extremely high miles.  Do you have anyone who can fix/maintain these cars?  If not you might want to look at a newer vehicle, perhaps under warranty.  Alot of the Korean vehicles are cheap, fuel efficient, have excellent warranties, and actually look ok.  Check out Kia Spectra; Hyundai elantra, Scion (Xa, Xb, tC).|`|5XYlHv6Paa	I would go for any Toyota. If you can find a matrix at that price, go for it.
XEuz5hGZaa	You can use a non-heated sensor but it will be very tricky. First you need to measure which lines are which with an ohm meter and volt meter. There is one power supply (12V to ground) that should be one of the black wires. There is also a ground which is the white wire and these two are for the heater and the ground for the sensor. The other black wire is the signal from the sensor. I am not sure what the blue wire does and have had strange results from testing it... it seems like it is connected to some kind of circuit. <br>  <br>  Here is the tricky part: the OBDII computer can detect not only the faulty sensor but also a faulty heater. So not only does the sensor have to work but you have to wire in a heat resistor of the same impedance as the heater for the oxygen sensor to bypass having a heater on your sensor. It is possible to do this but for all the effort it is almost worth the extra 50 or so bucks to buy a sensor with a heater in it.|`|7cd01ff8b8a793e244b9b62cc849b368aa	The heating element is to protect the sensor.  They are expensive, I payed almost 200 for mine.  The one with both connectors on them was a real snap to change for my 99.|`|AA11316085	replace it with the same style
AA11106143	its because its a hyndai..worst car made ever! sorry get new car!
JtM2NBlhaa	Big D is right. just park the car in the sun and let hood get warmed up. the warmer the better. once it has warmed up put dry ice on dents. the quick temperature change causes the metal to contract back to it original position. if its like hail damage after your done you'll never know it was damaged.|`|OTX3thgiaa	I have a good friend that is a body man. As crazy as this may sound he sets dry ice on top of those dents for  brief moments until the drastic temperature change pulls those dents out. It really does work. I've seen him repair hail damage that way.|`|jc1yDJZeaa	Try opening the hood and hammering them out from the inside, it should work if they are big enough to pop|`|AA12261615	i own a shop ,and if there's a lot of them you might be better of finding a hood for it,if you use any body filler in a hood because of the amount of heat under the hood it causes the body filler to show up,and this always shows on any car ,no matter what kind it is,if its just a few minor ones ,you might can fill them in and get them to stay,but in most cases i just replace them,its much easier and less time consuming,good luck i hope this helps.|`|AA12103587	you bondo or just buy a new hood or just leave it
f43WBxxGaa	the simple answer could also be just that you did not tightened the gas cap enough after your last fill up.  That has always corrected the problem for me in both my 2001 and 2005 elantra.  If they want to change the sensor for you while it is under warranty then go ahead and let them if it does not cost you any money|`|94d1acf25e2af629b7eb957530024002aa	My Accent 1.5M only started to have similar problems after I tried to confirm 28.83 km/l and 18.8 km.l fuel consumption by repetition<br>  <br>  It can be multiple problems at the time. My observed:<br>  Top up fuel tank full<br>  Caught in traffic jams repeatedly<br>  Spark plug wires dirty<br>  Spark plugs fouled<br>  <br>  I could not find anyone in my country who keep their Korean car for more than ten years (could be designed service life issue)|`|AA11652304	This is pretty normal and it happens a lot with the latest engine management systems.<br>  <br>  It's not serious and could be a spurious code. This is why the dealer checks for diagnostic codes and clears them to see if they return.<br>  <br>  Your car will not stop or breakdown and it is very unlikely that you will feel any difference when the light is on.<br>  <br>  An O2  sensor is a trimming device not a major computer input. It monitors the fuel/air mixture by measuring the amount of oxygen in the exhaust stream. You could have up to 4 of these sensors if it's a 'V' engine. 1 for each bank of cylinders (2) and a pre and post catalyst sensor. These last 2 sensors monitor the performance of the catalytic Converter by comparing input gases with output gasses.<br>  <br>  These sensors are a legal requirement through Australian Design Rules.<br>  <br>  Let the dealer sort it for you and try not to worry and it doesn't mean you have bought a lemon. It's a minor problem.|`|vnCqJHS7aa	Don't worry about it too much.<br>  <br>  I bought a Hyundai Elantra XD Elite, in 2003. The lock-out switch in the clutch started playing up intermittently within the first fortnight also, so I informed the dealership. They replaced the switch and there have been no problems since. That was 5 years ago and around 250,000 kms ago (I love driving).|`|lWD8f9veaa	not sure what state you are in, In Washington there is a lemon law so you wouldnt have to worry.. if the car turns out defective you get a new one for FREE! and, as far as the check engine light, that is for emissions... an O2 sensor would do it.  also a loose gas cap could do it!  make sure you put the cap on until it clicks! (it probably says that in the owners manual if you look at the troubleshooting area of the book)
rCBRTlGhaa	Motorcycles are only as dangerous as the rider and his/her experience. If you pay attention to your surroundings and learn some basic riding instruction, you should be ok. If you adopt the 10 foot tall and bullet proof personality, you will become a statistic in no time.|`|09658fd4d02a5d3573ab00d1116b0c86aa	I am against any crotch rocket bike, I ride enduros but any bike can be dangerous, I recently hit a deer at 25 miles per hour and broke 4 ribs, ruptured spleen and lost 2 front teeth,it isn't the speed that hurts, its the sudden stop.I was wearing all protective gear too but that is the risk to take if you want to ride. it IS worth it though. I still ride every opportunity I get. I recommend a honda rebel for around small towns.it is a 250 and gets about 65 miles to a gallon.or a yamaha xt 225 enduro if you want to do a bit of off roading as well as ride around town. both are low to the ground and have a great center of balance|`|AA10698633	Yes allbikes are dangerous. The Ninja is plenty fast.  You will put it down, but hopefully will not seriously hurt yourself..If you have not taken a motorbike safety course, do so asap.  Dress properly.  Shorts sandles will not cut it. Wear leather and a real riding outfit nomatter how hot it gets.  Wear a helmit no matter what the law says.  Ride like every motorist out there is blind and you have to avoid them.  Crossing the street is dangerous.  Riding a bike is dangerous.  In both cases, it is worthwhile|`|jYy6dDAZaa	When I was a kid  there was "Old Bob" the farmer Everone knew his truck and stayed out of the way.<br>  Did u ever see those ORANGE flags used by desert vehicles and baby strollers that stick up above car rooflines? Get one.|`|jFwuiRKxaa	THey are only as dangerous as the rider and a ninja is not the best to learn on.|`|fl60KL8oaa	IMHO you are less likely to be involved in a collision on a motorcycle than in a car.  In a collision on the bike you will be hurt, just a question of how bad.<br>  <br>  IMHO it is not the negligence of other drivers, but your *trusting* them to see you and obey man-made laws.  I am invisible and the only laws I trust others to follow are the laws of physics.  In 44 years I have never had a collision on a motorcycle.  (Falling down is something else, can even be fun, especially in the dirt, but not on gravel.)<br>  <br>  If you are in a small town with dirt roads around you may consider a Dual purpose bike such as a TW200.|`|AA11259435	BIKES ARE NOT DANGEROUS. <br>  <br>  People around you are. You need to be very observant of your surroundings and assume that others don't see you.<br>  <br>  Also you need to wear all your protective gear<br>  full face helmet<br>  gloves<br>  jacket<br>  long pants|`|13qub401aa	Bikes are no more dangerous, than anything else. Most of the close calls, I've had over the years. Have been mostly my own fault, other than the deer. I keep my brain, turned on and eyes open when riding. Your in more danger from wildlife, than other drivers.|`|CNM30VmLaa	theyr cool|`|i1qZER3Uaa	a ninja 250r is a great choice to learn on, the person that said they are not evidently doesnt know much about bikes, let alone ride.<br>  <br>  riding a bike is going to be more dangerous then driving a car,  but with the proper training and attitude, you should be ok.    main thing is you always have to ride as if your invisable to the rest of traffic.   when you come to intersections keep a good eye on cross traffic even while you have a green light,  never trust any other driver on the road.   stay out of peoples blind spots.   when your passing  pass fast.   I personally always ride 10mph faster then traffic, that way i dont have to worry about the traffic behind me as much.  its been proven to be safer, though it is illegal.  but i would rather have a traffic ticket and be alive and well, then follow the law and be injuried or dead.<br>  <br>  good luck, i hope you choose to ride, its a choice you wont regret.   you just have to come to terms with your own mortality,  everyone is going to die someday, i would rather have a short enjoyable life then a long boring safe life.

If you have AAA, I think you can take $60 off the top of the bill.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like the Ignition Lock Cylinder is roast.  If you already have it mostly apart, there is a button tab on the lateral side of the cylinder that will release the whole mechanism.  Once it comes out, you can turn the ignition on without the lock.  I saw one locksmith take a hammer to the lock cylinder once...  he hit it from the underside of the steering column.<br>  <br>  I'll see if I can find you more information from another forum.<br>  <br>  By the way, it couldn't hurt to buy one of these first:<br>  <a href="http://www.partsamerica.com/ProductList.aspx?PartType=521&PTSet=A&SearchFor=Ignition+Lock+Cylinder" rel="nofollow">http://www.partsamerica.com/ProductList....</a><br>  <br>  They're cheaper there...  I think the locksmith will charge considerably more.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  UPDATE:<br>  Unfortunately, it looks like the ignition needs to be turned to ACC for the tab to release the lock cylinder...  here is a post by the Wolfman on the saturnfans.com forum:<br>  <br>  "Provided you have the key, lock cylinder replacement is really not that difficult. The Haynes manual description is WRONG. If you are only changing the lock cylinder, you DO NOT need to remove the dash pad OR steering wheel! Just remove the upper and lower steering column cover, turn the key to the ACC position, depress the release tab, and the lock will pull right out.

YZt8LuLraa	Yes, but the biggest issue you will run into is fuel injection. You will most likely need to run a stand alone ecu to controll the fuel delivery considering a turbo car takes a lot more gas to produce that extra hp. You will need the turbo, a wastegate (internal or external depending on setup), intercooler of some sort, and a manifold to attach to your engine. If they make turbo versions of your car, you could just use all stock parts, other than that you will probably need to order a turbo kit for adapting a turbo to a non-turbo car. Then you will just need to worry about bigger fuel rails , fuel injectors, and a computer to control the engine managment.|`|a82f9387a494138364fc3c8782d8dec0aa	First you have to determine if the car you want a Turbo on can actually support it.

Autopartswarehouse.com, rockauto,com, partstrain.com and any local autoparts store can get you another oil pan for your car. They'll cost you under $75.00 for a brand new one. Don't dick around with another used Ford part from a bone yard.    I'm totally embassesed to tell you that I lost a rotted Ford oil pan after going to a wand type car wash in the middle of the Summer. On the way home from the car wash where I had jacked the car up to wash the underside the oil light came on 200 yards from my driveway. I shut her (93 Taurus) off, grabbed another quart of oil and finished driving it home. By the time I hit the drive way the oil pan douched all over the place.     I've never owned a vehicle in 50 years that the damn oil pan rusted through!|`|HUluAQM3aa	Oil pans are available online, delivered overnight for around $125.00 nd be sure to purchase a gasket set from Ford.

L9LkdThjaa	What nobody has mentioned yet, is that you would save on sales tax.  If you traded in a $20,000 you would save $1400.00 in sales tax in my area.  Also it cost a lot of money and time to sell a vehicle.  If it takes you a couple of months(industry standard is 92 days) to sell the car you also pay insurance for a few months. Then in those few months you have depreciation.  A $20,000 vehicle will depreciate at least $300 a month.  Then you have advertising, detailing, keeping it clean, time and dealing with people that can not get financed.  I would say 90% of the time it is better trading it in.  I will promise, selling a vehicle is not as easy as it sounds. It could several months.  When you add in sales tax, insurance depreciation and expense selling the car, you better get at least $3000 more than the dealer offered you.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	The dealer will automatically deduct for the shop inspection, any necessary repairs and vehicle reconditioning in order to get it ready to be put on his lot.

z8u8qFJeaa	First of all you have got to turn the hubs out to make sure it is in 2 wheel drive, put the truck on jackstands and put it in gear you will see by looking at the drivelines (turning or not ) whether it is in 4 wheel drive or not. When it is the front driveline will turn when it is not the rear driveline will turn, when it is in neutral neither will turn. There are many transfer cases that will fit that truck so you will be hard pressed to find a shift pattern unless you know the exact case that was put in. This procedure will be easy AND not cost anything.

NZFhiZocaa	I'd do whatever you have to do to make payments on the car, or sell it, or anything but have it repossessed. A repo will hang a credit curse around your neck that will take years to clear. You can give up buying a new car, getting a loan, getting a credit card, or renting a decent apartment with that on your file.|`|2s9LLJWnaa	Some questions and things to think about: <br>   - Is there a cost associated with housing the car until it's "needed"? <br>   - Can you save $$ by dropping the insurance during the time it's not being driven? <br>  -  Also, can you drop the registration to non-operational to help save money? <br>  -  Are lower APR loans something you can qualify for within the next 6-12 months? <br>  -  Will you be able to get a lower APR loan to pay-off the car loan at the end of your training or within a specified period of time in the Navy?  <br>  <br>  My advice is to make the payments, hold out and see if you can cut some costs and get this paid off.  Seriously, repossessions are bankruptcy and they stay on your record for a long time.  You may be young and made a bad decision which in ordinary circumstances would be looked over, but not in the world of banking.  If it doesn't look like you can get a lower rate loan, then revisit this.  <br>  <br>  Making a rash decision sounds like what got you into this mess to begin with, so making this decision the day before you go off to boot camp will only make it that much worse.  Hold off if you can,  but if you do, make those payments!  That's really important.  <br>  <br>  Did you know you don't have to make the minimum payment?  If you're having trouble and notify the bank, if you pay a small amount regularly in good faith, it will stay off a repo but double check on that before you go off willy-nilly and follow advice that might not apply in your area.  Good luck and thanks for serving your country!|`|4c51fd747abcd3dbda6f37357ffc47f3aa	People in the military can work out an arrangement for the car payments to stop while they are going through military training.Contact the people over your and explain what is going on and they can do the paper work for you.|`|VE8Bz9Sgaa	Your credit will be horrible for several yearsif you let them repo it, but honestly that's probably your best option at this point. To save the repo fee, call the bank and tell them where the car is and that they can have the keys. That way they don't have to send somebody out to get it.<br>  <br>  Buy a beater next time. And hope you rebuild your credit and use this fresh start wisely.
sCqdisvnaa	It really depends on what sort of sound appeals to you.  There are so many brands to chose from.  I'd add to the ones others have mentioned UUC Motorwerks, AA Tuning, Rogue Engineering, B&B Triflo, Stromung, Supersprint.  The list goes on.    The best way to chose an exhaust is to see what your buddies with similar car are running, and find an exhaust you like.  Not just at idle or wide open throttle, but also cruising.  Lots of aftermarket exhausts seem to drone around 2-4k revs, which can make them irritating in daily use on the highway.    I happen to have a UUC Corsa RSC 36 system on my M3 that I love.  Quiet cruising, and the sort of sound at WOT that makes you wind down the windows in tunnels and downshift just to listen to it.    European Car magazine did a nice comparison of E36 exhaust systems a couple of years ago.  Take a look here for the article to help you make up your mind:    http://www.europeancarweb.com/tech/0301e...|`|bB5ZPtvvaa	only posers do a muffler swap,  people interested in a performance car do an exhaust system-catback.  instead of looking at other people's tailights all the time,  perhaps you should focus on improving the performance of your relatively slow and pudgy bmw.|`|175ydQo5aa	Try an exhaust delete with just some nice tips on it, that sounds amazing and is by far the cheapest exhaust mod you can do. also lightens up your car because you get rid of the muffler.

There's nothing wrong with even staying with Magnaflow, then choose a nice tip.  Dinan, Borla, etc.... you'll just be overpaying.
WsKUEgQraa	I'm not sure if i'm crazy about them or that they have made me crazy lol.My family has over 150 years total time in working for the railroads.My dad retired with 44 years in as an engineer and so far i have 32 in as an engineer.The rest of my family is or has worked as conductors or for the union.I don't know why but i still get a thrill when start notching open the throttle and feel the thousands of horsepower coming to life.Especially if you have a low tonnage train with lots of horsepower.You can feel it in the seat of your pants.My dad took me to work with him when i was 9 and let me run my first engine for an hour so i guess i have him to blame.As for collecting i collect stuff from the late great Southern Pacific that sadly faded off into the history books.I hired out with them and dearly miss working for them.We didn't know how good we had it til the bunch i work for now took over.The job isn't near as good anymore.|`|0a63c080178f3d3c813dd371cc8e1f5baa	I have a cousin Bobby who has collected trains since he was a child he is now approx 50 lets say.  He has built a whole village in his basement or should i say city.  He works on it daily and has added to it for years now its absolutley amazing the most amazing part is when he goes to the basement he keeps a conducters cap at the top of the stairs he puts on before going down.  When we were younger i used to love to watch him blow up bridges and stuff like that he has  his entire basement covered.  His are all lionel his dad bought him his first on christmas one year when he was small for both him and his brother only he took the love of t trains on with him through life.<br>  <br>  |`|6MdZGP6Xaa	I got started back when I was 3 years old. My dad would take me out quite often to see the Amtrak train run through town. I can't really describe what it is about trains that I love, just that it's big machines moving America. And railroads are an ingenious, yet simple concept. <br>  <br>  I mainly take pictures, about 5,000 photos to date. Not many compared to many railfans.|`|CGr6EtRUaa	My first railway photo was taken in 1968 at age 12 on a visit to the Bluebell Railway, Sussex, England. I had already been a rail enthusiast since early childhood and collected model trains, books, etc. Around the same time my Dad and I built a model railway together.<br>  <br>  I've been an enthusiast all my life and must have taken hundreds if not thousands of photos of trains, both here and abroad. I collect books, anything from local railway history to locomen's training manuals, rule books, timetables etc. I also have a model railway layout under construction.<br>  <br>  I work part time in a local railway museum which has a collection of objects dating back to the early 1800s when the railways consisted of horse-drawn wagons running on cast-iron rails. The museum also has among other things a full-sized steam locomotive, a miniature railway, a working signal box (interlocking tower) and a telephone exchange.<br>  <br>  I spend many happy afternoons showing visitors round and listening to the reminiscences of the Curator, an ex-railwayman with extensive local knowledge.<br>  <br>  I like steam trains best of all and I am lucky enough to live near a Heritage Railway which I visit from time to time to relive the atmosphere of when 'Steam was King'.

7ObGOaPPaa	sealed boxes are loud<br>  ported boxes are louder<br>  bandpass boxes are loudest<br>  <br>  sealed boxes are smaller and more accurate, or have better sound quality. but they are very inefficient because they only use the sound waves of one side of the subwoofer.<br>  <br>  ported boxes are much louder and more efficient than sealed boxes. they add a port which allows the subwoofer to utilize the front and rear sound waves without cancelling each other out, which is why it is louder. ported boxes play loudest at the frequency to which the port is tuned. the lower the freqeuncy the better the sound quality. the higher the frequency the louder the sound. also ported boxes have a narrower range of sounds it will play loudly. for example a box tuned to 30 hz wont be very loud playing 50-60 hz frequencies. but most bass in music is about 40 hz. they are easier to make than bandpass boxes and are very common<br>  <br>  all other variable being the same bandpass boxes are the loudest. they consist of a box with 2 chambers. one is sealed and the other is ported (in its simplest form. bandpass boxes come in many variants, 4th order, 5th order, 6th order etc.). bandpass boxes are the loudest, especially at their tuned frequency, but they have an even narrower ranger of music than ported boxes do. they also tend to be the biggest types of boxes. alot of people will tell you bandpass boxes are the worst, but that is only because pre fab (boxes already made that you can just go and buy at circuit city/best buy) are normally tuned high therefore they dont have the greatest sound quality. so if you're looking for a bandpass box its better to have one made. but then again anybox other than a sealed one you should have custom made to the frecuency you want.|`|BB6lxDMaaa	Q:  Which box design sounds the best? <br>  A:  That question is like asking who's your favorite football team. Each box design has their merits. Here's a quick overview of their benefits.<br>  <br>  Sealed box: A sealed box is probably the most common. It can be the smallest box, offers the smoothest frequency response, but can be the most inefficient. A sealed box will play the lowest but not typically the loudest unless you're putting tons of power to the woofer. A sealed box is usually the most inexpensive to build and buy because its design is simple. <br>    <br>  Vented box: A vented, or ported, box is also very common. A vented box is larger than a sealed box, plays louder, but for a narrower frequency range. If the box is designed wrong, the subwoofer can be damaged or sound horrible. Vented boxes are a great way to add loud bass. A vented box is also easy to build so it will be reasonably inexpensive. <br>    <br>  Bandpass box: A bandpass box is a more complex box design as it has several chambers for the sound to travel through. A bandpass box is very efficient over a narrower set of frequencies. It can play the loudest but can also be a larger box. It can also be more expensive because of the complexity of the design and often the materials including plexiglass, neon or paints used. <br>    <br>  Bass tube: Bass tubes can be a great alternative to a box for many reasons. They are efficient, built solidly, are smaller, yet sound good. They are great for hatchbacks and pickups where space may be less. Bass tubes can also come powered so when space or the budget is a concern, a bass tube can be a great way to add bass and excitement to your music.<br>  <br>  Matching the woofer to the correct box is more important than the woofer itself. An awesome woofer in the wrong box will sound horrible and won't last long.|`|57bfd607400fd9aee46ddbc6f83a201caa	sealed boxes are best for listening to music like rock or jazz. If you want a loud, long deep tone go with a ported box.|`|6qqeJfOZaa	if you are looking for solid bass, go with a sealed box...if you are looking for a smooth low tone bass go with a ported box|`|abjTamdhaa	if you are sharing the box do ported but try and find one with like hardly any vent hole to keep the solid the base of a closed box you dont want the vibes fighting in the box itll be nothing but solid noise just think closed box someone yells from other room sounds kinda dull open the door just allitle and the person is much louder. might even be able to buy a closed box and drill your own holes in the back of the box no one would know the secret. hope it helps|`|lCuY6y83aa	sealed boxes. aren't the slim series the ones that slide under the seat? bandbass limits your bass

y1hfGpQlaa	Q1: 8 months in the heat of AZ is pretty crude, but it probably wouldn't be enough to damage the interior in just one year.  After about three years, fading would definitely be in the cards.  As a Tucson-an, I would say 9-10 months of the year you can keep that top off.<br>  <br>  Q2: On the complementary cassette that comes with the Jeep Wrangler (at least the '04 model), it repeats over and over again that the dash should never get drenched.  Anything besides some light rain could severely damage the interior electronics.  I'm not sure if this is the case for '06+, but the TJ interior cannot get wet.<br>  <br>  Q3: Not sure about the airbags, but it could cause some damage.  I'm not sure what the wading limit is, but three and a half feet seems pretty extreme for a base Wrangler, even a Rubicon.  You would have to ask a dealer, or do a bit of online research to find out for sure.<br>  <br>  Q4: To make more things possible, add some Mud Terrains (which may come on the Rubicon standard) and lift the thing!  My father's Wrangler changed drastically with a 4 1/2" lift and some 35" tires- his was a Wrangler X.<br>  <br>  Overall, the Wrangler is rude, crude and mostly impractical for daily use, but it's just as American as the Mustang or the Corvette.  I always recommend them to friends so long as they don't mind god-awful mileage, limited cargo capacity, a harsh ride and terrible freeway commuting.  The fact is, there are many other SUV/CUVs out there that offer a better bang for the buck, but there's nothing like driving a Wrangler in its natural habitat.|`|xYZD692Iaa	The dash is weather "resestant".

fY2acIVtaa	It could very well be done for. Did you hear any knocking when it shut down? If so then that was the pistons smacking against the chamber at about 2000-3000 RPM, which is very fast, and would cause the piston to crack the block.<br>  However if this is the first time that it has overheated then it is unlikely that this is the case. How new is your car? A lot of them have sensors on them that will just shut the car down if it gets too hot. It wouldn't hurt to try and turn it again, besides, how else are you going to find out what wrong? Before you do though check all the fluids and make sure they are there.|`|T5vxSFcOaa	If it doesn't crank you have a fried engine.|`|2QdpjRqIaa	It depends...You need to know what made the car overheat, oil problem or a cooling problem.  It it is a oil problem then yes, more than likely it is ruined and you would have to get new sleeves and pistons etc.  If it is a coolant problem, then I don't exactly know right off the bat.  Good luck in this situation!|`|33bac61e6f72678bf4f35a943a41d176aa	Maybe and maybe not. You need to find out what caused the overheating to occur in the first place. Bring the car to a trustworthy mechanic and let him (or her) look at it. A lot of it depends on how long it was running hot. Check the oil & radiator fluid levels and try to start it keeping a close look out for any leaks under the car and the coolant temperature & oil pressure gauge.<br>  Good luck|`|ctYPC2cFaa	Nobody can answer that question for you over the internet without seeing the car in person and diagnosing it. I would tow it to a reputable repair facility and have it looked at. Good luck hope it's not the engine.

FEw10C08aa	If you put wider wheel, thus wider tires on the rear wheels of a FWD, you are going to get more understeer than usual.<br>  <br>  If you look at people who race FWD in road courses, they put wider wheels and tires in front to reduce understeer.<br>  <br>  Understeer is not fun.  The front of car will slide whenever you throw your car into a corner. And you need to reduce speed or adjust you steering to correct this. <br>  <br>  This is something that most race car drivers want to eliminate, but car manufacturer set up a little understeer  for saftety reason to warn drivers that the car is at its cornering limit.<br>  <br>  So larger wheels and tires in rear of a FWD is not a very good idea.

H6Nb8KX8aa	At 90,000 miles there are lots of things that have either recently been replaced/maintained, or will need to be addressed shortly.  In no particular order, here are some comments:<br>  <br>  Tires:  You're well beyond the first set of tires, so check the remaining tread on the car.<br>  <br>  Timing belts/chains:  Most timing belts should be changed around 60,000 miles.  On some cars, timing belt failure will damage engine components by slamming the pistons into the valves.  Other cars are designed with enough clearance to prevent catastrophic failure.  Timing chains can last far longer.<br>  <br>  Automatic Transmission:  Some cars do NOT want you to flush the transmission fluid.  Other cars expect fluid changes every 30,000 miles or so.  There are many seasoned mechanics who say, "if it has not been routinely maintained, DO NOT perform a power flush.  You're going to dislodge all sorts of particles and cause future problems"<br>  <br>  Brakes:  The car has gone through multiple sets of brake pads and the rotors may not have enough material to be "turned" again.  A standard two-wheel brake job is $100 or so.  New rotors can be $100 each.<br>  <br>  Exhaust:  If the exhaust system is stainless steel, it may last a long time yet.  The catalytic converter is now beyond its 80,000 mile warranty.  A new exhaust will probably run you $500 or more.<br>  <br>  Radiator/Cooling:  Routine coolant flushes should help it last a long time.<br>  <br>  Battery:  In hot climates a battery will last about 3-years.  In the mid-west you might get 5-years.  Any more is a gift.  Ambient temperatures influence battery life more than vehicle mileage.<br>  <br>  Starter / Alternator / Water Pump:  Any of these could go at any time once you at this high mileage.<br>  <br>  Overall engine: Congratulations if you've read this far.  The single most important maintenance is frequent oil changes.  Hopefully there is evidence that the car had oil changes (including filter) at 5,000 miles or so.  Spark plugs, wires, belts, and various various sensors may be reaching their "end of life".<br>  <br>  Who is offering a 5-year warranty on a car with 90,000 miles?  First of all, get all the coverage details specified in writing.|`|Ht0L86m2aa	Timing belt at 60000 to 80000 or timing chain at 100000. These probably wont be covered by warrenty but they might, if they brake cost will be very expensive depending on the vehicle again. If the motor is an interferance motor they might just replace the motor, if it is a non interferance motor the cost will be the timing chain and what ever parts it proke. Now just because it is a non interferance motor doesn't mean there won't be major repairs needed.|`|QZ82tpNiaa	You will have to do a tune up...plugs, wires, ignition parts(cap rotor, coil pack...depending on type of ignition). If it is a GM, the cooling system will need flushed depending on the type of coolant(green=every 30,000-50,000, orange or pink every 100,000 miles). The orange/pink is the dex-cool type of coolant that GM uses out of the factory and I would recommend when flushing, switch to the green coolant. The green coolant is the same old fashioned coolant that has been used for quite some time(I know it has been longer than I have been driving and that is 22 years). If it is a Ford, they also use a different type of coolant called G0-5. The color of this coolant is yellow/gold. This gets a flush every 50,000-75,000 miles. The coolant flush will cost between $70 and $100 depending on where you go. The tune up will cost between $100 and $200 depending on motor and where you go. Some motors have been known to cost quite a bit more for a tune up. Just ask the machanic for an estimate first. Of course everything cost a lot less when you do it yourself...you aren't paying $65-hr+ for labor.<br>  <br>  These are just maintenance schedule things that will have to be done not including maintenance on parts that go bad.(alternator, water pump, thermostat, serpentine belt, fuel injectors, fuel pump, etc.)<br>  Good luck.|`|AA10698633	90,000 miles is not that bad for a modern car that has been looked after.  I presume that this is a newer, but high milage car that has just been driven lots.  The water pump and fuel pump and alternator could go at any time (or not ).  If it was a lot of highway miles, the brakes may be just like new.  As long as the oil was changed regularly, I would not worry about the power train. (for another 90,000 miles)

Depending on the model and build year, autos customized in this manner can be labeled "donk," "box," or "bubble."The name donk came from an impala, because it looked like a DONKey<br>  <br>  Hi-risers originally grew out of the Dirty South drug, pimp and hip hop subculture but the trend has spread across the United States. Vehicles customized in the hi-riser style are distinguished by their oversized (even disproportionate) rims, ranging from 22" to 30" or more in diameter, as well as fanciful custom paint-jobs and expensive audio equipment. Suspension modifications similar to those employed on lifted pickup trucks are made to give adequate clearance for the large rims. Often the suspension is modified so the front end sits slightly higher than the rear end, giving the car a swaggering appearance. Because of the exaggerated look gained from installing a lifted suspension and enormous rims, donks are also known as "hi-risers" or "sky-scrapers."<br>  |`|o50BydFXaa	this is a very custom vehicle mostly:<br>  Impala<br>  Caprice<br>  and so on.....<br>  <br>  First you lift the cars suspension<br>  then you reinforce the frame and suspension<br>  bigger sway bars and such<br>  <br>  Then rims - the most important part usually somewhere between a 22" and 26" rim sometimes bigger.<br>  <br>   With a custom paint job<br>  and a custom sound system<br>  custom interior<br>  lambo doors<br>  <br>  these cars can be driven daily or built for show only.<br>  <br>  I have built many of them and have a few I use for show they draw a crowd pretty fast.<br>  <br>  <br>

La casa di Monaco ha anche un'immagine più sportiva e dinamica, che prediligo, mentre Audi ne ha una prettamente tecnologica mentre Mercedes elegante/lussuosa.|`|SVcwUBAQaa	Dipende cosa vuoi, la bmw è piu lussuosa e sportiva, la mercedes è prevalentemente lussuosa e l audi è una via di mezzo......io sinceramente ti consiglio la bmw è la piu affidabile e bella stilisticamente, mentre la mercedes è piu da chi ha soldi ma nn gusto|`|kQdoYZW0aa	ciao!<br>  presupponendo che in generale io preferisco la BMW, negli ultimi tempi, i modelli sono più banali. La linea delle BMW, solitamente slanciata, è stata compattata e resa più massiccia e meno "snella" e il muso, di solito aggressivo, è stato raddolcito. perciò, attualmente, la migliore delle tre è la mercedes, dalla linea classica. inoltre è una macchina molto sicura. <br>  ciao, kiss8!|`|23qFQbXTaa	dico subito BMW ma dipende quali macchine metti a confronto. La mercedes non mi piace più. puntano solo sull'eleganza e tutte le loro macchine mi sembrano per vecchi signorotti. La BMW invece rimane sportivissima anche nella sua eleganza e lusso, in più ti offre un modello per ogni evenienza. ci sono modelli che consumano poco per chi guarda al portafoglio ma anche modelli inarrestabili (vedi la nuova M3 con cambio a doppia frizione, devi provarla!), modelli più giovanili vedi serie 1 e via divendo. sono anche molto all'avanguardia...guarda un po il nuovo X6!<br>  a me piace molto anche l'Audi ma della nuova produzione solo alcuni modelli. sembra che puntino solo a produrre macchine con grandi motori...|`|Rwiqogy6aa	ma ke domanda è?<br>  devi esssere specifico...<br>  audi ha avviato da qlk anno un nuovo corso,quindi è in una fase tutta sua nella quale ricopre tutti gli spazi commerciali.<br>  forse è la migliore nel rapporto qualita prezzo.<br>  poi preferirei la bmw alla mercedes,ke mi sembrano piu ke altro makkine autostradali|`|JbLB76Qoaa	Mercedes,classe ed eleganza.|`|axVYmqfPaa	Ciascuno di noi ti parla per esperienza personale,se ci fai caso ogni persona che ha risposto a questa domanda tira l'acqua al proprio mulino...chi ti risponde bmw ha una bmw,chi un audi ha un audi e chi un mercedes ha un mercedes.<br>  Andrebbe analizzato in modo piu' oggettivo!<br>  <br>  Comunque la mia famiglia si è sempre trovata bene con la casa mercedes.<br>  Mio fratello ha una classe s500 4 matic...se ci siete saliti sapete che comodità offre.<br>  Mio padre ha una cl600...credo che poche macchine sappiano offrire quello che ti da un cl.<br>  Mio fratello prima di prendersi s aveva una cls500 sport(fino a 3 settimane fa) quindi ti parlo dell'ultimo restyling.<br>  Mia sorella ha una classe c sw Amg ultimo modello...altra bellissima macchina,poco capita forse.<br>  <br>  Mia madre e mio nonno sono porschisti...quindi non possono capire.<br>  <br>  Tra tutte le case automobilistiche che abbiamo provato nessuna ci ha dato un'affidabilità tale,forse la maserati,ma quello è un discorso diverso.<br>  <br>  |`|Er3OVKs4aa	La Mercedes,considerando che l'ultima C (con il pack Dinamico e le versioni BlueEfficency)ha fatto davvero passi da gigante. Se parliamo di innovazione la BMW regna sovrana (Efficient Dynamics e linee stile)...Audi...bhe Audi sinceramente non mi dice niente...lo stile è sempre quello...la qualità è ottima (ma anche le altre)...passi piccoli e sicuri, mai innovazioni...filosofia VW. Invece Bmw e Mercedes ogni tanto danno prova di vitalità con modelli particolari e con linee moderne. Se poi fanno flop o meno, o sono belle o brutte è un altra cosa, ma almeno ci provano.<br>  Prendiamo per esempio la Mercedes, tiratofuori due modelli molto interessanti come la R e la B. La prima un crossover tra un SUV, un monovolume e una berlina di lusso, purtroppo con poco successo; la seconda una piccola berlina/monovolume molte elegante e nello stesso tempo sportiva con un successo strepitoso. la Bmw ha appena lanciato la splendida e controversa X6, inovazione stilistica allo stato puro Coupè di lusso e SUV insieme, si potrebbe dire che sia l'unica  i listino...il successo? 13 mesi di consegna....detto tutto. Poi le berline hanno stilisticamente innovato due pilastri delle berline di lusso con la S e la 7...Che dire, bel coraggio!<br>  Passiamo all'Audi, l'ultima vera innovazione è la A2...ve la ricordate? un OTTIMA auto, il 1.4 aveva prestazioni da 1.6 e consumi da 1.2 grazie al telaio e alla carrozzaria in allumio, e l'hanno cavata dal listino con disonore...poi a parte l'esercizio di stile TT il nulla, le solite berline, le solite SW...e adesso le solite SUV...le solite auto con i soliti TDI e motori VW...niente di più ma va anche detto niente di meno della solita massima qualità.<br>  Per vince BMW ai punti (per poco) poi MB e Audi con distacco, perche arriva dopo in tutto per esempio l'A2, concorrente della classe A arrivata l'ottobre del 1998 è entrata nel 2001, la Q7 concorrente di X5 e ML nel 2005 mentre le altre nel 98-99...poco fegato!|`|EMK5FBWFaa	la bmw è  attualmente il colosso per  sportivita l'audi  si sta sviluppando ma per il momento è un gradino sotto <br>  la mercedes anke se fa modelli amg che sarebbero quelli sportivi  ottiene le stese prestazioni di potenza  delle volte inferiori  o di poco superiori però cn una cilindrata superiore esempio la bmw m3 è un 4000 quello della mercedes  classe c amg 6300 (penso però sta sempre li sul 6000) la bmw ha 420 cavalli la mercedes 450 se nn erro  sn 30 cavalli si è vero  però alla bmw basta fare un 4500 e raggiunge la stesssa potenza oppure modificare un po il 4000 e ci arriva subito poi in prestazioni è simile logicamente in velocita sn etnrambe autolimitate a 250 però in scatto stanno li  poi la bmw come tenuta è un mostro anke se l'audi qui forse la batte per via della 4x4 però il paicere di guida della bmw ricorda molto quello dell'alfa di  tempo fa nn  l'alfa di adesso che nn arriva nemmeno alla caviglia di bmw mercedes e audi cm io premio bmw per me attualmente è la migliore nel suo campo|`|DaP2LPUraa	Tutte e tre le case hanno un vastissimo mercato a livello mondiale,essendo poi macchine tedesche.Cmq ne fanno moltissime di auto come queste anche se ad un prezzo molto alto almeno qua in Italia,ma con prestazioni decisamente non modeste anzi tutt' altro.Adesso te la racconto una,domenica sono andato in montagna con la mia famiglia,al ritorno abbiamo preso la supertrada(a doppia carreggiata con due corsie l' una piu' quella d' emerganza)per ritornare nella nostra citta',all' improvviso ci ha sorpassato una Mercedes Classe C SW nuova di zecca(adesso non so che versione era)ad una velocita' impressionante,noi stavamo sui 90-100 all' ora,ma quella Mercedes ci ha superati a 200-220 all' ora(oltre il doppio),per dirti che il limite era decisamente di 80 all' ora......io cmq sono scoppiato a ridere eh......Cmq per dirti dell' economia che hanno queste tre case automobilistiche e' tanto vasta anche se si sta sentendo un po' di fatica a causa della crisi che incombe.Cmq sia Audi,Bmw,Mercedes ed anche Volkswagen hanno un sacco di esemplari di Suv,ma che consumano una quaresima ed inquinano una quaresima,poi la benzina ed il gasolio che costano molto.Il giorno d' oggi e' difficile trattenere questi bestioni!.......Rischiano di scappare da soli e ritornare da dove il proprietario ha comprato l' auto ahahahahahahahah........................... se vuoi cercare sul Web eccoti accontentato,guarda nei 4 siti qui sotto......|`|XauyJJUiaa	1 mercedes <br>  2 bmw<br>  3 audi<br>  4 volkswaghen<br>  5 ford<br>  6 opel<br>  <br>  la mercedes è la migliore xkè<br>  quando esce un nuovo modello mercedes(cosa ke avviene prima delle concorrenti) gli avversari appaiono vekki e obsoleti.<br>  a livello di innovazione e mekkanica bmw nn ha rivali,mentre le audi sn auto di gran fascino ma alla fin fine sn soltanto volkswagen cn l'abito da sera...|`|yummlQVOaa	ho avuto una a6 e adesso una serie5...diciamo che l'audi tutto sommato ti da' piu soddisfazioni,perchè sai che l'hai pagata meno e le perdoni un po di peccatucci.

hF1EpoVUaa	They the factory will say yes.But if your front end does not sag,springs are good,if the front end does not bounce more than once when bouncing it by hand,then the shocks are good ,plus if there is no signs of a leak .But the squeak could be the mounts,not only of the struts,but also check the lower control arm,any sway bar bushings they could be worn.Plus check out the upper and lower ball joints,tie rod ends for play..If you do not have a shimmy then there is a good chance the joints and tie rods are good,,But check it out any way...Both are good brands I prefer Monroe
AA12261615	they usually don't need the springs replaced just the struts should be just fine on that one,the only thing replacing the springs will do is make it ride a lot firmer and may stiffen the ride of it up a lot,unless your having problems with one side setting lower than the other one is replacing the struts will be fine on that one,usually the only time you replace a spring is when you have a  weak one that's causing the car to set not level,if that's the case then you may need to replace them otherwise id just replace the struts,good luck with it.|`|4u8XHkxuaa	you should,nt have to replace the springs, just the struts.|`|cL98wKvqaa	on a 14 year old vehicle it wont hurt to replace the springs with the struts, although Im sure you dont notice the difference the springs have weakened over a 14 year period.  by replacing them you will improve the ride of the vehicle more so than just replacing the struts.  I suggest being very careful no matter what you do. the springs are under alot of pressure and I do not advise using the threaded rod type spring compressors to me they are dangerous and a pain. If you do not have a clam shell type compressor or access to one save yourself the danger and pay a shop to put these on.

57a27112ff5da1ecde6a2a5a8886a35aaa	It means the cars ECU (engine control unit) has detected a problems somewhere within the engine. You have to take it to a car dealer/garage that has a VAG-Com diagnostic tool and they can plug the car in and tell you the problem. If the car is running then 9 times out of 10 its just a safety warning! where the car had a slight blip!<br>  <br>  Be warned, VW may charge upto ￡100 for this service!|`|mKVFIklaaa	It's the service indicator, it's telling you the car's due for a service.<br>  Let me know if you want to know how to reset it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Re above, I'm pretty sure that the engine management warning light is different - it's a picture of an engine.<br>  The spanner symbol on most cars is a service indicator (VW, Peugeot, etc), but on others it's an immobiliser warning (Vauxhall)|`|mTYyDtPOaa	yes as someone has already mentioned it is the service indicator light.<br>  to cancel it. Turn the ignition off. On the clocks under the left hand side of the speedo. push and hold the button in, then turn the ignition on you should see the word service come up on the display. Release the button. Then turn the knob on the other side of the clocks to the right. This wiil re-set the service light.
VMqlGrleaa	Non è "obbligatorio" che l'assicurazione online sia più economica. <br>  L'assicurazione online spesso si rivolge a un target di assicurati ben preciso: molta esperienza alla guida, classe molto buona (quindi pochi/nessun incidente)... In generale, basso rischio. Se per esempio tu e tuo padre vivete in una provincia che le assicurazioni online ritengono "non desiderabile", è possibilissimo che l'assicurazione ti venga a costare di più. Quello della provincia è solo un esempio, ma ci sono molti altri parametri che le assicurazioni online valutano diversamente dalle compagnie "in carne ed ossa". |`|28ea2fc06015a7e0096a3636fabb769daa	prova a farti anche il preventivo su www.quixa.it<br>  per le mie caratteristiche è la cosa più economica che c'è in giro e finora sono stati precisi (è del gruppo axa)<br>  poi certo le valutazioni variano molto da compagnia a compagnia, comuque hai ragione una assicuarazione on line dovrebbe essere quantomeno competitiva, altrimenti che ragione c'è di fare l' assicurazione online?<br>  tuo padre comunque paga un ottimo prezzo|`|UbBC7T9xaa	Ciao le assicurazioni dirette di norma hanno alle spalle gruppi assicurativi tradizionali e da lì recepiscono tariffe clausole condizioni e le mettono a frutto tramite una rete di vendita alternativa ovvero internet o il telefono.<br>  Le compagnie dirette hanno un target molto preciso, una nicchia di mercato scelta in base al rapporto sinistri/premi ed alla peculiarità del territorio, in parole povere cercano i clienti migliori che non provocano sinistri e risiedono in zone d'Italia gradite alla compagnia per la bassa percentuale di incidenti ecc..<br>  Quindi può darsi che tu e tuo padre non rientriate nei parametri della compagnia on line, di qui la tariffa più alta rispetto alle tradizionali, ti assicuro che il vostro non è affatto un caso isolato.<br>  Per di più le compagnie dirette hanno spesso rivalse più alte e clausole di guida limitanti, tutto questo abbassa di molto il premio ma è rischioso in caso di sinistro...<br>  Attualmente in Italia le compagnie dirette coprono circa il 9% del mercato assicurativo, e quasi tutte sono in continua perdita, forse sono tenute in vita più per un motivo politico che di reale utilità.<br>  Saluti<br>  Tomas|`|9SpR0IZAaa	Anche a me è successa la stessa cosa, sono "sotto" la prima classe e  pago € 680,00 all'anno (rca+furto incendio+collisione+eventi naturali e sociopolitici...) ho provato a fare più preventivi con le telefoniche e alla direct line addirittura mi costava quasi il doppio (circa 1.100,00) senza neanche sapere le eventuali franchigie e se valore a nuovo; ho provato ad inoltrare una mail per chiedere informazioni ma a distanza di un anno sto ancora aspettando... |`|hupwpSF5aa	Anch'io ogni volta che ho fatto preventivi on line ho notato che erano sempre più alti di quanto pago attualmente,però mi sono sempre convinta di aver sbagliato qualcosa....<br>  Io sono in prima classe,ho una Chevrolet Matiz,quindi di bassa cilindrata,nessun incidente all'attivo e la patente da 13 anni....bhè,mi venivano cifre da capogiro,mentre attualmente pago 268 euro all'anno!!!!!|`|FkmTNTOuaa	A me hanno regalato il 15 % di sconto alla Dialogo Assicurazioni (società di polizze auto, moto e imbarcazioni, attualmente fanno la pubblicità sulle reti Mediaset) seguendo questa procedura di questo sito : <a href="http://www.mcnweb.it/dialogo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcnweb.it/dialogo/</a><br>  <br>  Funziona davvero ed è la migliore e la + conveniente!<br>  <br>  Prova a fare un preventivo tanto è gratuito che ti costa...|`|Jv8gd9Uoaa	prova a farti anche il preventivo su www.conte.it<br>  per le mie caratteristiche è la cosa più economica che c'è in giro e finora sono stati ottimi (è del gruppo admiral)<br>  |`|a4CpRSc1aa	dipende dalle province di appartenenza
ewddT9CZaa	Ho letto che entro l'anno entrerà in commercio la versione GTA della Mi.To. con i nuovi motori benzina Multiair (gli stessi che equipaggeranno la nuova 159). Il motore scelto sarà appunto un 1.8 da 230cv, chissà che bestiolina che ne verrà fuori.<br>  Per quanto riguarda il concessionario è normale che "non sappia nulla" o neghi, poichè loro puntano nel vendere il prodotto in commercio, non  fare semplici preventivi per il futuro(soprattutto in questo periodo di crisi dove i bilanci contano).<br>  <br>  Per la cretinetta sopra. GTA è la sigla che contraddistingue tutte le macchine super sport di casa alfa. Se avesse letto la domanda avrebbe capito che il giochino da lei citato non c'entra nulla, o anche se avesse un pò di logica poichè se l'utente avesse realmente voluto informazioni su quel video game non avrebbe postato la domanda sulla categoria Alfa Romeo.|`|1Ui3rkVlaa	si la producono e si puo' gia' preordinare se non erro....<br>  <br>  peccato che ci siano alcuni fattori non proprio entusiasmanti..<br>  <br>  il fatto che parte da 35.000 euro circa... con pochi optionals di serie.. messa "decente" con pelle, navigatore cerchi etc.. superi i 40.000 euro... e mi sembrano davvero troppo per un 'auto piccola 1.8 con un motore molto ma molto spremuto (che quindi non durera tanti km come altre auto di pari costo con motori meno esasperati)<br>  <br>  io con 40.000 euro ci comprerei ben altro...

69eef7356154e5af99966c41002555e9aa	It's a new concept of Maritime development for 21st century London. A group of volunteers restoring old historic boats have clubbed together under the Maritime Volunteer Service to work from a pier just down river from O2 (near the Beckham Academy) to restore these boats to full use. I believe they have a fire-boat which was active in WWII, a tug driven by steam and a Brixham fishing trawler built in 1923
17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	It's good to see that you want to follow the law.  You can not legally sell the car until you register it in your name. On the records of your DMV this vehicle still belongs to the one that you bought it from until you register in your name. Yes, you can do this without buying insurance, but, as already said, inform the DMV at the time you change the registration that you are doing so only to sell the car, and it is not going to be driven on the highway. If there are any unpaid fees and taxes owed on the car you will be asked to pay them.|`|SuZbBnycaa	All your answers are correct. I would add:  you must tell the DMV that you're not going to insure it by using the Affidavit of Non-Use (REG 5090) . That prevents them from putting your registration in suspension for not having insurance. You still pay registration fees, but promise not to have it on any public road. (because it's not insured)    This is different than a REG 102 Affidavit of Non Op- Where you don't pay for registration fees. You again promise not to have it on any public roads.       which one to choose?  Non Op is usually for years of not on the road.  Non Use is usually for months of not on the road.|`|6xyeYjkkaa	No. You don't need insurance unless you register it and put it to use on the road.|`|1bYITsABaa	Mustang is right. You can get a title, but no tag.
xcG5Tasiaa	It.... might.     The Cherokee got a body restyling in the later part of the 1996 model year, and most of the lights and a lot of the glass underwent a change.     Try calling a dealer and seeing if the part number is the same, that might clue you in.|`|bW931jBaaa	Call or contact the site to make sure it will fit. I would think it would fit, but maybe the size changed in 1997.|`|HpWmkhabaa	It would not fit, you need to go to a Jeep shop to get it cut and fitted properly

H8XpaaPDaa	1995      my dad used to have one but sold it after a few months because the previous owner did sh*t body work on it so it was rusting bad, and it took up too much gas. i have one more complaint, the rear seats have barely any leg room, but the trunk is massive. its not a bad suv, but i'm more into sports cars personally.|`|gCdvDjfkaa	Idk but I say.....Buy American!!!!!!!!|`|SXgHyZusaa	95 is the last year. 96 and on is lift gate type.

407f520d43e2a1541bb86c0c9a0b505eaa	Not sure if they still have them available but yes, you can have the stripes painted onto the car after you purchase it, if you cannot find one with the stripes.  Paint or vinyl both have their advantages and disadvantages.  My 08 'stang has vinyl stripes and they look as good as the day they were put on!  Vinyl can be removed, and the color can be changed if you wanted.  Vinyl is also cheaper than paint.  Paint is more expensive, and if you do not bring it to a reputable paint/body shop, the stripes could go on crooked, and you CANNOT fix that without major body work (aka new paint& sanding).  Try allfordmustangs.com for more help!  good luck!|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	I'm sure they're available. Try a high-end body shop where you live. Someone has to fix them when they get damaged, so these stripes have to be available.|`|DV4xyeChaa	stripes are not painted..they r vinyl stick on...im sure you can get them...first try ford,,saleen...roush racing...

bW931jBaaa	Battery and alternator|`|E0j6mhqhaa	As far as your second engine goes, is the battery in good shape?  A dying battery will cause ignition problems but in addition to the dead battery, you have to have a bad alternator.  With a good alternator, it'll run fine at higher engine rpms because the alternator is charging but as soon as you let it idle, it'll die.  However, if the battery is bad, it isn't going to crank over.    I don't know about your bike, but the 80's models 1300's were known for having a kill switch that would fail.  I have one and while the switch clicks fine and tests ok with a multi meter, hook it up and there's no spark at all.  I've wired around the switch so it'll run.  With a multi meter, you need to check to see if you're getting juice to the ignition coil.  Or simply hot wire the bike and see if it runs ok.  If so, then there's probably a bad wiring connection somewhere.  My bike is also known for wire connections that corrode, especially the 3 wire connector from the alternator.  When they corrode, they get hot enough to melt the plastic connector.  If your alternator isn't charging, be sure to check the connectors first.      Something else to check is the battery cables.  Check for corrosion that's up inside the rubber covering as well as check where the negative cable attaches to the frame.  If that connection corrodes, rusts or gets loose, it'll cause all kinds of weird symptoms.    Let me know what you find.  I might think up a few more things to check in the mean time.|`|mZZ5xqZSaa	ask a mechanic|`|AA10346371	A better place to ask this question would be at a forum specifically dedicated to this motorcycle.  You could try the KawaNOW forum.  This forum is dedicated to Kawasaki Nomad owners.  Here you will find other Kawasaki Nomad owners who can help you with this problem.  Sometimes mechanics will hang out at these forums also.
kjAWsDwLaa	It's the DMV showing that you have an acceptable program of self-insurance on your vehicle(s).  You'd have to show them that you have some reliable way of paying for any injuries or damage other than commercial insurance, such as $50,000 spare cash available and dedicated to  paying such amounts.  It's really meant for large businesses that can afford it.|`|mznZxJNUaa	By google to collect some related information or you may try using answer engines like yahoo answer or yedda.com to get some related ideas.nonetheless,If you prefer some direct resource,here http://www.insuranceidea.info/free-insur...  is a good one from my own experience.
