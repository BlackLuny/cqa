20090128094713AAZ0SP3	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Attachments & Photos	Just what IS the Yahoo! mail size limit for attachments?	The info seems to be conflicting.  I always thought it was 10MB.  Here's what I get when I click "Attach Files":      "Attach Files   Click "Browse" to select a file. You can attach files up to a total message size of 25MB."      In case we need clarification, there's a question mark link.  I clicked on that and it says:      "10MB gives you lots of room to attach things like photos or files. A typical image from a digital camera usually uses around 1.5MB, but often much less. Find the photos or files on your computer by clicking Browse and double-clicking the item you want to attach. Then, when you're ready, click Attach Files. If you have more than 10MB to send, try splitting it over a few emails."      So which is it...25MB  or 10MB?      I realize the key may be in the "total message size", which would be the total of the attachments AND the message.  The average email message is only 2-10kb.

20090128091724AAqSDMo	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Shopping	Weird situation on an online purchase?	I made a purchase online a month ago from a website who sells garments. After 2 weeks, my order was still pending so I called the number they provided and left a message on the answering machine telling them I wanted my order canceled. I emailed them numerous times and still no reply, 3 weeks later they processed the transaction and took money out of my credit card, assuming they ignored my calls and emails, and a delay of my order being processed I called my bank and immediately had the transaction reversed, I got  my money back. However, today, I received the product which originally i called in to cancel. I called their number and it is not working! I do not want to keep the product and I don't know if I should just put a "return to sender" on the package and it is UNOPENED. Now what I'm thinking is, since i had my money back, what if i returned the item and they credit my account for the refund? what should i do? I wanna do the right thing!

One of my contacts always appears offline on yahoo messenger, but he is online to everyone else. He did not set the "appear permanently offline" option on my id, or on the group I belong to.

What could be the cause of this, and what is the solution ?   Thank you.

20090225130900AAw9uoG	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Anyone have experience will PayPal problems?	We "bought" a computer using PayPal that should have been here 2 weeks ago. The seller was very friendly and reassuring until he got the money, then he disappeared. PayPal said they would transfer the money back to our bank acct. and it would be there by Friday(last week). They lied. Now they say they are keeping the money while they investigate. Anyone have any idea if we will ever get our money back and how long it will take if we do?

I made the security questions for password. He is like programmer.. who knows how to heck people accounts. And I need a professional help to make sure, he won't do this again. How can I do it? How should I report this person to google company? Is there any better way?    My gmail accounts are very personal. He keeps bothering me a lot.    Please help me.
