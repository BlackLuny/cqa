FU2Z33fTaa	No Reply is bye bye to me.  If you get no answer to your questions then two things could possibly be happening.  One: seller is not familiar with ebay usage and just wants to get rid of the item, this happens alot with collection items when dependents of the owner want to get rid of them, seller is young and irresponsible, or seller is from overseas and doesn't understand english to well.  I've had a couple of Hong Kong and Japanese sellers that i've asked questions with no answer.  One japanese seller replied but the communication gap didn't work out.  Check the description to see if they have given another email address, check the item location, check the grammatics on item description.  Two:  Seller is a con artist with some shady intents on selling.  Its either stolen, broken, or skippy.  If seller contacts you for unpaid strike but didn't respond to your e-mails, then they know what they're doing.  And watch out for the ones with a 2page long description terms page, i drop them immediately, especially cause i'll overlook their terms. i found a seller with a link to additional terms on the description page, I still won the item, but i decided to strike out because they wanted to deal outside ebay.  This is where you change your search spellings.  Try searching 'orange mouse', or mouse with bumps.  Some people just don't know what to call it even if its in big letters on the package.  Hope this helps.|`|J1stiMioaa	i wouldnt buy either, i sell a lot on ebay and i always try to answer questions even if i dont know the answer i still reply to say im not sure, it is common courtesy.<br>  i emailed some1 about some headstone cleaner for my sons grave to see if it was suitable for the stone we have, i got no reply, it was probably not suitable but i think he hoped if he ignored me i would buy it anyway, which i didnt, im not risking spraying a ￡10 cleaner on a ￡900 headstone!
3D9n965daa	You need to get eBay involved and go to the community help pages and click on selling.<br>  It will give you a list of questions that may be relevant to you.<br>  There are most definitely answers  there it is just the case of seeking them out|`|DiPc84wQaa	contact ebay, explain the situation to them, be truthful and everything will be okay hopefully :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  -Huza|`|J1stiMioaa	hes scamming you, tell him if he is that unhappy then to return the phone for a refund, by recorded delivery. or as the others have said, get in touch with ebay.<br>  sometimes if you are new to ebay they put this restriction on to make sure you are not a scammer, if he hasnt left any feedback after 14 days you get the money anyway with or without feedback|`|vx3C9SxOaa	that's the reason why i wouldn't shop on ebay or the like, you must be able to report him the must allow for negative feed back on both sides you must contact ebay and inform them x good luck|`|d40e4596ee31f7749a7773684fe3ab6baa	Hi.

They definitely will not! I have never in my life heard of such a thing as you not getting your money until the buyer leaves positive feedback.<br>  You need to quickly go to pay pal and check out if your payment is there or not. The item should never have been delivered without payment in the first place. If you don't have payment and the customer is already threatening you, you need to act fast or you will loose money and your phone!<br>  File and unpaid item now if you can, and don't let the customer bully you by saying they are leaving a negative. That is against ebay rules and they are trying to scam you.<br>  *Ah, you have that wrong, it is SELLERS that cannot leave a negative FB any more... Buyers can leave all the neg's they want!|`|BbVDIteuaa	He's tryna scam you. Ignore him. He'll get into trouble at some point.|`|bHIb1CVMaa	report it to ebay and don't send it if you havent already.

GAADrxCZaa	Beh ti dirò.. anche se non mi dicono grazie l'accetto lo stesso... se mi hanno scelto come miglior risposta vuol dire che sono stata utile e l'assegnazione dei 10 punti è un premio che mi danno quindi il ringraziamento è implicito... Certo, un grazie è quasi d'obbligo e non costa nulla, ma va bene lo stesso...!<br>  <br>  E tanto per prendere il discorso dei punti, ti faccio notare come in realtà è radicato talmente tanto che neanche ce ne acccorgiamo: il fatto di ringraziare il richiedente di aver scelto la nostra risposta implica che nel nostro cervello prevalga il fatto di pensare ai 10 punti ricevuti, non all'aiuto che abbiamo offerto e che è stato apprezzato. Se pensassimo all'aiuto offerto e non ai punti risponderemmo "Prego" non "Grazie"... in realtà il volere i punti è più forte di quanto pensi... per questo io non rispondo certo con "grazie" a chi ha scelto la mia risposta, grazie perchè?! perchè mi ha dato i punti?! allora lo scopo è avere punti o aiutare? Grazie perchè ti ho aiutato?! semmai quindi si deve rispondere con un "prego" visto che il mio aiuto è stato utile...|`|adwYjSiOaa	Ciao!!Premetto che tutte le volte che ricevo i 10 punti per la migliore risposta,scrivo sempre un messaggio di ringraziamento!<br>  Mi sono accorta però che quando scelgo io la migliore risposta,non ho quasi MAI ricevuto dei GRAZIE!<br>  Anche da queste piccole cose,si può notare l' educazione di una persona!<br>  Per rispondere alla tua domanda posso dirti che non rinuncerei mai ad un GRAZIE!!!Per lo stesso motivo che ti ho detto prima!!|`|bx0QSOYWaa	e ora ecco ttt i santi k fano gli ipocriti!!<br>  ma qnt puo' essere ipocrita certa gente!!?? nn dico k tuti quelli k dicono la prima siano ipocriti... ma vorrei qnt di loro nn vorrebbe k tu scegliessi cm miglior risp la sua anke senza un rigraziamento?!<br>  !kiss kiss!<br>  ps.x risponderti io opterei x la seconda tnt nn si sa neanke da ki arrivano i ringraziamenti!! forse sembro falsa, ecc, ecc... e mi metteranno tnt pollici in gu ma almeno nn sn ipocrita!|`|y1fEyEJmaa	Io sono dalla tua parte infatti i alla fine delle domande scrivo sempre GRAZIE così posso dare il giusto Andi alla risposta.

You just have to ignore the thumbs down.  Hope this helps!!!|`|suPD7c3gaa	It's possible... but what you need to do is learn to just not care.  They mean nothing.  Even if they are just given by someone who disagrees, discussion isn't allowed so they say why they may have disagreed.  So whether it's just someone who disagrees and can't explain why, or some jerk giving them for his/her amusement, they are meaningless and should be ignored.

MINy26pjaa	You would probably be surprised to find out that someone asks this question at LEAST once, pretty much every day. The majority of questions don't get much more than 5 or 6 answers, and lots of them get only 2 or 3. If there are more answers than that, usually it's just people saying pretty much the same thing over and over. <br>  <br>  A lot of things determine how many answers you will get. A big one is making sure the question is in the right category. Most people hang out in the categories that they know the most about so they can give good answers. I like Words and Wordplay so I am there a lot. If someone asks a question about computers or finance or something like that there, I'm not going to be able to answer. <br>  <br>  Another thing is try to make the question interesting. Give a good explanation of your question in the header, and try to make it eye-catching. Always try to use good spelling and grammar, so people can understand what you are asking. <br>  <br>  A huge thing is timing. Try to put up your question when a lot of people are on the site, like around the time people are home from work, or after dinner, when people get on their computers. The only drawback with that is that a lot of other people will be asking questions too, and it can take only a few minutes for your question to be scrolled off off the screen to another page. Strangely, you'll also find a whole lot of people answering questions really late at night.<br>  <br>  If you don't get an answer that helps after a day goes by, you probably won't get any more. You can repost your question the next day, but don't post the same question every few minutes.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Your last four questions are chat.  Wallpaper or a mask are personal to you and violate the terms of this site.  Questions must seek knowledge or advice beneficial to all.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Okay I will.

HrrxiM2xaa	Most paid surveys are fine to give your B-day to. 75% of all survey and focus group sites are not scams and really just need to know your opinion. However, deciding your security isn't up to me. Use your head; if a site says you can make thousands of dollars a day, they're lying and will probably sell away your personal info. Most don't do that though, so don't worry!

qfSKgxDsaa	That's such an awesome idea!!  I love it!  I'd get all the gossip girl books (assuming that you have them and lay them out spiratically through out your party area.  If you have the first season you could have that out too.  Then you could really get into the action of the characters (but dont have to)  like dress up like them and there is no limit with how many Blaire's, Nate's, Serena's, etc.  BUT you'll have name tags and then thats the name they have to put on their name tag which ever one they are!  Then your cake could have gossip girl written on it and then your name (though you dont have to be a "gossip girl")  OR have all the names of gossip girl written on the cake!  You can google for some other ideas and then maybe (if you have time)  have some goodie bags made with gossip girl theme, etc. You can get balloons probably and stuff.  Also, I work at Toys R Us and I know there's a gossip girl game out, you coould get that and play it (I think it'd be awesome especially if you had like a sleep over with 4 - 5 girls.  Oh!  And you could print out pictures and hang them around whereever your party is.  Just try google and see what you can find...this is the most awesome question ever!  (And I've answered a lot)  Star for you definitely!!  (I'd give you more if it'd let me :)
cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Craigslist uses a bad procedure in their pages called "mailto:". It uses the default email program to send email. Many people using Yahoo mail have the default set to an email program (Outlook Express, etc) that they do not use. By installing Yahoo Toolbar you can set the default to Yahoo Mail.<br>  <br>  The work around is to copy the link in Craigslist and paste it into the TO address in Yahoo Mail. Be sure to edit the address and remove "mailto:" and everything beginning at the "?subject=".<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  mailto:sale-123456789@craigslist.org?s...<br>  change to:<br>  sale-123456789@craigslist.org<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

Good luck!|`|rSTNUGy3aa	Just a word to the wise that a person can't realistically lose 30 lbs. in 30 days, which is a pound a day.  The lost 'weight will 'only' be water and muscle as opposed to fat loss.  A person shouldn't lose more than 1-2 pounds a week for a safer, longer-term weight loss.   I believe that those products contain guarana which is supposed to be similar to caffeine in terms of giving possible.  I'm not sure how safe that is though and please check with your doctor before trying that especially if taking other drugs or herbs.  For long-term weight control, eating healthfully and increasing one's physical activity is recommened. <br>  <br>  For healthful eating tips and to search for a registered dietician (RD):  <a href="http://www.eatright.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.eatright.org</a><br>  <br>  For the new Food Pyramid:  <a href="http://www.pyramid.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramid.gov</a>

Make sure you set the 360 picture as “primary” and saved then go to your profile check that “use my 360 picture” is set, click preview then OK.<br>  <br>  But having said that With the ongoing work by yahoo engineers on changes for the new version of yahoo 360 expected sometime soon (see the blog below for more info), some delays with the 360 avatar can be expected, and it can take minutes to days for the avatar to show.<br>  <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-1qCkw2Ehaak.hdNZkEAzDrpa4Q--?cq=1&p=59806">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-1qCkw2Eha...</a>|`|7u77AiBjaa	You have activated the Yahoo! Profile (<a href="http://profiles.yahoo.com">http://profiles.yahoo.com</a> ) instead of Yahoo! 360.<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> .

a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	God|`|6M1Z3XIdaa	the egg. <br>  <br>  <br>  LONDON, England -- It's a question that has baffled scientists, academics and pub bores through the ages: What came first, the chicken or the egg?<br>  Now a team made up of a geneticist, philosopher and chicken farmer claim to have found an answer. It was the egg.<br>  Put simply, the reason is down to the fact that genetic material does not change during an animal's life.<br>  Therefore the first bird that evolved into what we would call a chicken, probably in prehistoric times, must have first existed as an embryo inside an egg.<br>  Professor John Brookfield, a specialist in evolutionary genetics at the University of Nottingham, told the UK Press Association the pecking order was clear.<br>  The living organism inside the eggshell would have had the same DNA as the chicken it would develop into, he said.<br>  "Therefore, the first living thing which we could say unequivocally was a member of the species would be this first egg," he added. "So, I would conclude that the egg came first."<br>  The same conclusion was reached by his fellow "eggsperts" Professor David Papineau, of King's College London, and poultry farmer Charles Bourns.<br>  Mr Papineau, an expert in the philosophy of science, agreed that the first chicken came from an egg and that proves there were chicken eggs before chickens.<br>  He told PA people were mistaken if they argued that the mutant egg belonged to the "non-chicken" bird parents.<br>  "I would argue it is a chicken egg if it has a chicken in it," he said.<br>  "If a kangaroo laid an egg from which an ostrich hatched, that would surely be an ostrich egg, not a kangaroo egg."<br>  Bourns, chairman of trade body Great British Chicken, said he was also firmly in the pro-egg camp.<br>  He said: "Eggs were around long before the first chicken arrived. Of course, they may not have been chicken eggs as we see them today, but they were eggs."<br>  The debate, which may come as a relief to those with argumentative relatives, was organized by Disney to promote the release of the film "Chicken Little" on DVD.

89dbee8e7769addf9180fd326f6c861aaa	Let us take an example. There are 50 people entering the data on the different computers, which are connected by a central server. They are all working on the same file. In this case, the server will NOT handle all these 50 updates at the same time. For one microsecond, the server will receive updates from one computer. In the next microsecond, it will accept updates from another computer. Similarly, the server will handle all the users one by one. But the changes are so quick that no user will feel that his requests are not accepted at the server. So, even if two users press the button at the same time, their time will differ in terms of microsecond or some small fraction of time. The server will handle the request which it received first.

7u77AiBjaa	You're question isn't clear. Have you or haven't you already terminated your Yahoo! account?<br>  <br>  For whatever reason, sometimes the Y!360 space is not deleted upon account deletion. Just in case, it is recommended that you remove content that you've added to 360 BEFORE deleting your account. Otherwise, getting that content removed from the web may turn into a hassle.<br>  <br>  If a completely deleted account doesn't result in a deleted 360 space, you can contact Yahoo Customer Care through this Account Deletion Help Form at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/registration/deletion.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/edit/re...</a> and/or use the 360 ABUSE FORM at <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abuse.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/abu...</a> . You can also call 1-866-562-7219, 1-408-349-1572, 1-408-349-3300 Hours: 8a-5p M-F (Pacific). Although, it's possible that you won't be totally deleted from the user registration database until after 90 days.

However, you can post the link to the questions. To do this, store your picture or pictures on a reliable photo-storing website. The best websites to store your photos in and post the links are Flickr, Photobucket and Tiny Pic, but if there is another website that you can use, feel free to use it. Then, all you need to do is copy and paste the link to the picture into your question/answer. However, due to a 999 Error, you might have to post the link after you've already posting the question/answer by editing into your response, or adding it as additional detail.|`|1CABRATlaa	You need an image host, this converts a photo into a link that you can post in your question.  I use Screen Dash. Its the only photo editor that can take screenshots, do paint and photo editing, and host images. Thus, you can share images with your friends and family. Its free, easy to use, and provides very professional photo editing.

When you get to level 2 you can rate (thumbs up and down). Here are a couple of websites to help. You can delete your answer by clicking the delete button in the small print to delete it. In order to comment you have to go to a resolved question. Then find the comment button. Click that. Type in your comment. Then click submit. There aren't any rewards when you become a top contributor or go to the highest level which is 7. You can send a user a message if the person allows it. You can check by clicking on their avatar. To make a avatar you go to your profile and click on "Edit My Info". Then scroll down until you see the options for the avatars. Click on "Edit My Avatar" or something like that in the blue print. Then a page should come up. Then you make the avatar. Return to Yahoo Answers and go to the Edit My Info page and select the last one as your avatar. <br>  <br>  HOW TO CHOOSE BEST ANSWER FOR YOUR QUESTIONS<br>  <br>  1. Wait four hours after you post your question.<br>  2. Go to your question<br>  3. There should be a blue button under each answer you got.<br>  4.

You can go to a category that you know alot about. Get at least 40 best answers in a month. They hand out TC badges (the orange badge under my avatar) on Mondays only. They can take it away if you don't continue to get best answers in that category. You need 10% or more of best answers in that category (rumored).|`|BGOPARrTaa	oh yeah.. that u need to be a level 2 to do it.. i dont like it but its the way they made answers.yahoo so.. just answer a lot of quistion and before u know it u cane give thumbs up :D|`|DWJOMWQ8aa	You have to be level 2 to rate.|`|rFtKFp03aa	You have to be the next level up.. <br>  <br>  click on your profile and read about the point system...|`|8alk54WHaa	you need to be level 2. check your profile to see how much more points you need to lvl up.

Go through all your settings and don't forget to save them too. (<a href="http://spam-blocking.cn/top-7-ways-to-st..." rel="nofollow">http://spam-blocking.cn/top-7-ways-to-st...</a> )<br>  <br>  Under Spam Protection, make sure your Spam Guard is turned ON. Option to immediately delete all Spam messages. This will force all new email to redirect to your Inbox. Option to Block messages that you mark as Spam. If you plan on keeping your<br>  Bulk folder, also option messages you mark as Not-Spam to be moved to your Inbox. Always Option to Block all Images until you can look them over first. This prevents spammers from knowing you opened their email. Save Changes.<br>  <br>  Under Blocked Addresses, type in spammer.com, this will stop all Spam that has been reported to Yahoo from ever entering your email. I recommend you remove everything on your list first. This will give you a fresh start after you type in the "spammer.com".<br>  <br>  Under General Preferences, Folders/Search Results, Special Folders, option to redirect incoming unsolicited email to the Bulk Folder. Save.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/ya...">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/mail/ya...</a><br>  <br>  If you get email from someone you don't know, NEVER open it (it may contain viruses) and report it as SPAM. This will automatically block it from your email account. When you do open an email that is Spam, you have alerted the sender that your account is Active. (<a href="http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...">http://help.yahoo.com/us/tutorials/mail/...</a> )<br>  <br>  This will immediately stop all the Junk Mail considerably. I only get maybe one or two Spam emails a Month. Remember, anytime you give out your email address over the Internet, you can expect to receive some kind of Spam, unless you have made sure that site is secured.
