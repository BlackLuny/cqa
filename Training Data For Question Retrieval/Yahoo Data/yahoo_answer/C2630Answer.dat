BVJBY4eQaa	Old wives tales are a major cause of most repairs that leather technicians go out to fix and hairspray and solvents are the most common. Taking notice of these untested/unproved old wives tales could cost you a great deal of money if it goes wrong.   Just repaired a very expensive jacket that had been virtually ruined by using hairspray to remove ink. It did not remove the ink and left a far worse problem to solve.    Successful ink removal will depend on the type of leather you have, please see the following:    http://www.lttsolutions.net/whatkindofle...    For ink removal:    Ink Removal  Removing ink from leather is not a cleaning problem.  Most ink removal products will not work simply because of the length of time the ink has been on the leather.    Ink is a dye and has re-coloured the leather (this is what it is meant to do)  The longer the ink has been on the leather the harder it is to remove because it soaks into the finish. Once it has soaked into the finish you have to use very strong products to remove it, which will also remove finish and pigment which then need replacing.    Pigment/Protected leather  If the ink is on a pigmented leather then the first thing you should try is an LTT Ink Stick. The fresher the ink the more chance you have of removing it. It is a good idea to have one in your house if you have pale leather and children!!!!     Old ink will be harder to remove than new ink and may mean resorting to solvents which will also remove the finish. This is probably best left to the experts    If an ink stick doesn't work a solvent based remover will need to be used and it may also remove finish and pigment so is best left to the experts.    You should also be using LTT Leather Protect on your suite. This will act like a 'scotchgard' and will make any more mishaps easier to clean off.    You will see many people recommending household products to remove ink  this is not recommended as most simply will not work, some may appear to work but the damage they cause can make a much bigger problem which is then un-repairable (even by a technician)    DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING:    Hairspray - This is very risky as it can make the matter far worse by spreading the ink over a bigger area and can sometimes then be impossible to fix.   Nail Varnish remover/solvents will remove the finish on the leather even if you cannot tell it is doing so and this will then need replacing, and alcohol may do the same depending on the strength of the finish on the leather.   Baby wipes  just about the worst thing you can use on a leather as they break down the finish and will eventually ruin it.   Milk or Toothpaste - these are just silly ideas that will leave sticky residues on the surface which will help to break down the finish on your leather.   Silicones/furniture polish  should not be used on leather. They will form a coating on the surface of the leather which will not allow any moisture to get to the leather itself and will eventually break all the finish down and cause it to crack.   Hide food will not remove ink and will leave residues on the leather which will attract dirt and oils.   Most leather cleaners will not remove ink unless a very good leather protector has been used on a regular basis.   Magic sponges or erasers (Mr, Clean Magic Erasers). These have been tested by experts in the leather industry and have found to do a lot of damage to certain finish types on leather.    Aniline Style Leather  As aniline style leathers are largely absorbent it means that the ink will have soaked straight into the leather itself. This makes it impossible to remove. No product will successfully remove the ink.     DO NOT try ink removing products on aniline style leathers as most will leave a greasy residue which will then cause another problem.    Because aniline style leathers are absorbent the ink will carry on moving through the leather and may become less obvious over time. Cleaning and protecting will also help to dissipate over time|`|l1dAq3pOaa	Try leather cleaner.   If that doesn't work try hair spray.  If you can find a supplier for maintenance, they have a product called Graffito. That really works!|`|jieKgKF1aa	most furniture shops or upholsterers sell ink remover for leather my leather lounge came with some ink remover sachets so these would work on leather car seats as well.|`|XEeFbieTaa	mmm i dont know but you can maybe try Lysol, or try vinegar|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	soap and water first any typ e of cleaner might like hand cleaner or leather cleaner after|`|pGBTHEjtaa	ask .com  www thrifty .com     use hair spray.

USi94ydJaa	A camshaft position sensor is not a moving part and is not adjustable.  It is simply an electrical magnet of sorts.  It simply tells the ECM (computer) the position of the camshaft in relation to it's rotation.  It is a relatively inexpensive electrical part, and intermittent failures are common.  Basically it reads the fluctuations in magnetivity  to determine cam position and if there is a slight mis-read, it will trigger the check engine light.  Those mis-reads definitely could be the magnet weakening, which would cause your engine to try to compensate and result in the hesitation.  After a set number of key cycles (car on-off) without a mis-read, the check engine light will reset and turn off.  This doesn't mean you don't have a problem, as it will get worse... eventually your car won't start, as it requires a CPS signal to run.  Another issue that could influence the CPS signal is the timing belt.  The camshaft is run by the timing belt and therefore is directly affected by an imperfect belt.  If the timing belt has not been replaced yet, as part of your routine maintenance, then this is an area you may want to think about.  A stretched belt or weak belt tensioner could easily cause  your problems, although it's not as common.  My recommendation would be to go ahead and replace the CPS (it's less than $25 at autozone), then see if your problem resurfaces.  If it does, then you will need to take it into a shop asap because a broken timing belt can cause massive internal engine damage on that vehicle.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i had a bad cam sensor on my car once and it would go off after awhile. you might take it someplace and have a scan tool or volt meter used on it. it might just need adjusted.|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	Could it be crank position sensor.|`|x3istER1aa	take it out and look if there anything wrong with it check if you need to grease it up?|`|3ac93834cfd708d0c96b477db8599bb1aa	Make sure the electrical connections are good.  If it continues happening replace the sensor and call it good.|`|vPDYTdrBaa	Have had neon's with camshaft sensor problems in the past at our shop.  Look at the sensor for oil on it.  And disconnect the connector and look for oil intrusion.  Oil and grease will cause the sensor to cut out intimately.  To the point of a no start.  Hope this helps.  Auto tec..|`|X2ED3OrRaa	While the car could have something else becoming an issue, the 'check' at auto zone only seeks out electrical problems. I would still remember that the computer did warn me of an Electronic problem.  If the light is off I'd not worry, and if the light comes on again and tell me the same I would take that advice.                                   "BRILLIANT"!!!!
bkpa5OHtaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.undonet.com|`|VuIxxJvqaa	Honey the best thing you can do is to buy newspapers and read the classifieds.    Maybe try online classifieds, or even try local car auctions, as they usually sell cars cheaper than most other places.    Just remember that if a car normally sells for $7000, there would be a reason that it is for sale $2000 cheaper than market price.    You should also check that there is no finance owing on a car you are looking at buying, so that no one knocks on the door to take it back once you pay for it.    Its a good idea to have a car checked out by a mechanic as well. $150 or so may save you thousands in repairs.|`|ff3246ab4193235aa580f70384f57b09aa	What year and what options are you lookng for.

VuIxxJvqaa	I think the way I would go about it is to speak to the dealership and explain the situation to them.    If you are qualified and they want you to work for them, a month isn't a long time. I know I would be willing to wait a month or so if I found the right person for a job.    Perhaps it would be a good idea to speak to the workshop manager, or the dealer principal and explain the situation to them. Its unlikely that a Judge will do a great deal to help you, if you are a repeat offender.     Maybe if you offer to work in the dealership doing other duties that dont involve driving for the month or so until the ticket expires, they may appreciate your honesty and give you a start. There's lots of things you could do, like detailing, or in house mechanical repairs that wouldn't require you to have a drivers licence.    That is the way that I would approach it.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	well if your not going to drive most cars in order to work on them but if its required maybe drivers ed at dmv online your state might remove some  many states have drivers safely online that when one get points they can remove by doing it

iga1jl2saa	Hooking them up is pretty easy. You'll need a switch kit that includes a switch and a fuse with wire. You can put them anywhere you want in or out of the car.     Basic switch.  Has 3 prongs top is for power from the battery, middle is for the power wire from the neon light {switch} and the bottom is for the ground.    You'll need to ground the switch to any bare piece of metal.  To save wire ground all of the neon lights to a piece of bare metal near the lights.    Make sure to run a fuse from the battery to your switch!

VuIxxJvqaa	Why bother?    If you're just doing it for the lumpy noise, you're wasting your time.    There's no point having a massive cam and stock everything else. The stock rocker gear wont be able to take the added stress of the extra lift and duration and things will start to break.    You would be much, much better off to put a mild cam, plus replace the lifters, like you should always do when changing cams, and have something sensible that will work instead of something stupid that wont run right and break stuff.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Depending on how many miles is on the car, I would say no. If you are going to build it, then build it. You don't want to put a big cam in an engine that already has a lot of miles on it. Also, if it's a V-6, it might not do any good anyway. If it's an 8 cylinder why not go ahead and do a basic rebuild on the engine and put a few more goodies in while it's torn down.|`|8zVxYkluaa	http://www.ls1tech.com/forums/generation...    Start reading.    There's no point in going with a "big aggressive" cam if you don't have the supporting mods.  However "big aggressive" is very subjective.  Something like a 224/224 with around .560 lift would work well on a stock motor.  You'll need to get the PCM retuned for the cam, I'd also absolutely recommend headers.    In the end it's all about what you want but throwing in a big cam for the sake of throwing in a big cam is a waste.  The idea is to match the cam with the rest of your components.  There are plenty of cams out there for stock headed/stock intake motors.  However the bigger you go the more the cam will benefit from better heads and intake.  There are a TON of "cam only" LS1 cars out there, but you have to keep in mind that they have all the supporting bolt on mods to go with it(headers, cat back exhaust, LS6 intake, ported throttle body etc.).    To the one person that said if the car is a 6 cylinder don't bother....if you don't know that a Z28 is a V8 then you really shouldn't be giving motor advice, lol.|`|71133c5b27fbdaa8629cfbb5dafa77afaa	hmm sure if your building up the rest of the engine and modifing the engine control system and fuel system at the same time|`|ACzRWfDdaa	That all depends on your definition of aggressive.  You could step up the lift and duration some and get by.  The overlap is really what decides how well a cam will work in a street car.  You don't want too much overlap, although it does make it sound awesome, it won't work for a street car.  Since it is an automatic your are limited a little more than you would be with a manual.  You don't want a top end monster, just a nice low to mid-range power with enough up top to be happy.  You might also think about putting in a slightly higher stall converter when upgrading the cam.  Just make sure you have enough vacuum for all of the necessities and you should be ok.|`|QnCmowfmaa	Since you already have an SLP exhaust. Your best bet is to ask SLP what they would recommend.

wpgRMjgraa	Applicants under age 18 must hold an instruction permit ( learners permit ) license for a minimum of six months prior to issuance of a provisional Class A, B, or C driver license. In addition, the minimum age of the person who must accompany any instruction permit holder during the operation of the vehicle is 21 years of age.     Phase Two restricts the driving privileges of persons under 18 years of age during the six-month period following the issuance of an original Class A, B, or C driver license (Provisional License). These persons may not operate a motor vehicle with more than one passenger in the vehicle under the age of 21 who is not a family member.     All original licenses, other than an instruction permit, issued to persons under 18 years of age will be marked "Provisional." The license will be vertical and will be dated to expire on the applicant's 18th birthday or next birthday occurring after the date of issuance. A fee is required to obtain this license. The renewal fee is required for each one year of renewal period. No renewal notice will be sent as it is the responsibility of the applicant to obtain a verification of enrollment and attendance from their school. If the instruction permit or driver license is not due for renewal, a fee is required for a duplicate instruction permit or duplicate license (i.e.: lost license, change of address, removal of GDL restrictions).|`|zWB3jHHPaa	Learner's permit you get when your learning to run people over.

It's totally normal and is necessary for efficient engine operation and longevity.
bda465ikaa	Probably the cheapest jet you can charter is an Eclipse 500. Roadrunner advertises per seat, but you can probably negotiate a per plane price that is reasonable. They are not much bigger than a sport utility vehicle. so 4 people is maximum.  ========  A cessna caravan propeller plane is probably the cheapest plane you can charter if you have at least 10 friends. They only go about 200 mph (for up to 5 hours) with no bathroom. People used to rent them to go from San Diego to Laughlin.|`|AOPuoo16aa	Good luck with that. Most small jets cost $1500+ per hour not including crew. Even if you could get a group of people together to pay for the plane it would still not be any cheaper than flying commercial. You can look at your local airport for charter services and get prices.|`|3gTwd93yaa	Thats a paradox. Even if you buy an old, cheap, carcass-of-an-airplane, and fling in some engines and minimal instruments, IT STILL WOULD COST MORE TO FLY IT AS A PRIVATE AIRPLANE due to the maintenance costs. The only exception would be an A-320 or similar aircraft filled at least 75% with your family and friends....operating as a private charter.  Even then it might still be more expensive because the airport fees may be at a different rate for non-scheduled traffic.|`|f21c4568248ded0eeab01a76d3a81476aa	What do you consider cheap?|`|dWLgwb3baa	Depends on your definition of "cheap", what kind of plane you want to charter, and the location.    You can charter a 4-6 seat piston twin for a few hundred dollars an hour to go island hopping or short (100-400 mile) trips.    Turboprops are in the $1000-1500/hr range.  They are generally useful for up to about 1000 miles.    Jets usually start at $2000/hr and go up from there.    You can't really get around those prices.  Charters operate on very tight financial margins.  The prices charged barely cover the cost of operating the plane.

What most teens fail to understand is that they are receiving a PROVISIONAL license.  It will continue to carry the word PROVISIONAL in red type until their 18th birthday.    The PROVISIONAL license means you must adhere to the restrictions of no passengers for one year (under age 25) and no driving between 11:00pm and 5:00am.  Please pass this information along to other friends that tell you differently.|`|71133c5b27fbdaa8629cfbb5dafa77afaa	all i can find is that they have a graduated license system.     http://www.dmv.org/ca-california/teen-dr...|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	type in  california dmv and look it up easy

VuIxxJvqaa	What type of light is it?    It is most like a warning light, meaning that something in your car requires your attention.    Instead of wondering how to turn the light off, you should ask why the light is coming on.    Read your handbook and find out what the light is for and check out that section of your car and find out what the problem is.

L9LkdThjaa	Why don't you fill your name in as the buyer.  Put the purchase price as $0 and get a title (NO license plates) in your name.  Depending on the state, a title will cost anywhere from $7.20 to around $20  It would be the best money you spent.  Then you sell the vehicle as if was yours and then pay your aunt.

If your buying new, VW is the way to go for safety, while still being stylish. If your on a budget, the Ford Focus is the way to go, new or used. They lose value pretty quickly, so you'll get a good deal on a decently new one, and they aren't very expensive from the get go, so you can get a new one for about 12k.    The honda, Toyota and Nissan are prominant in the market, meaning that resale value is high, and minimal haggle pricing, so unless you have a decent budget, or plan to buy super old, then you should check out other options before settling on one :)    Good luck!|`|jF0l4ghraa	chevy malibu, mazda 3.  these are all pretty small cars that are safe and practical.  i think the malibu's can get well over 30mpg hwy.  please buy american.    if you want a larger sedan, the chevy impala (also gets over 30mpg).    whatever you get, make sure it has ABS (anti-lock brakes).  this is very important for driving in the rain or snow.|`|DnuNsN1xaa	You can find a nice convertable 1986-1991 BMW 325i or 318i for pretty good prices!

54jCmmI4aa	You might consider a Subaru; however, you may have transmission problems in the not-too-distant future.    Toyotas, Hondas, and Acuras are difficult to find at that price because people cling to them for years, if not decades. I would be patient.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	They are the best, especially Honda/Acura.    Are you looking for a sports car or what?    There are lots of great cars made by these brands. Subaru and Mazda and newer Mitsubishi's are also good.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	While the brands you mentioned are well respected, they also don't depreciate as fast as some other vehicles.  So while $5G's may pick you up a '02 model year Honda for example, that same 5 grand can pick you up an '04 or '05 Chevy ( newer model car with less mileage ).    While there is nothing wrong with buying a used Honda, Nissan, or Toyota, I think you may pass up some great used car deals by not being at least willing to look at other brands as well.    Just make sure that if/when you do find a car that you are interested in ( regardless of the make and model ), have it inspected by a trusted shop or technician.  Spending a few dollars on a pre-purchase inspection can save you hundreds, if not thousands of dollars in headaches later on.|`|HpwyYmoIaa	Toyotas are very reliable probably the best decision for you, i would never buy or own a honda they arent made well and made with cheap parts|`|xuThaCvRaa	Whatever kind of vehicle you get, go for a coupe or 2 door.

Nice part also is they can always get spare parts should you ever need anything.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	I just recently paid $160 to get a 4 ton floor jack resealed.  This seems to be an excellent deal.|`|BNlSh53faa	I think the three ton is probably overkill.  I know for the Honda, you need the creeper and jackstand because you should never get under a car without them.  I know with my truck, I can scoot underneath it with out a jack a lot of times since its so high off the floor.  One good thing about getting a jack with this capacity though and in favor of your proposal, is what happens if you put a ton and a half of material on your truck and you get a flat.  The three ton would jack it up in a heartbeat.  If you've got the money to do this go for it.  You should realy like it.  What height does the jack raise off the floor?|`|AN1EpGMqaa	I bought the same thing and love it and you can't beat the warranty.Plus,most of their stuff is made in the USA.

If they sound ok while dry, you should be ok.  Just check your belts for any wear and tear or cracks to be on the safe side.

hcGUKAYFaa	two questions, how do you know its not charging? and do you have power input to the alternator exciter circuit?    to explain why these questions are important, let me explain a little about how this system works. An alternator generates electricity by passing two magnetic fields across each other, at least one, and sometimes both magnetic fields are created by a coil of wire that has power run through it to create an electromagnet.  this coil is called the exciter circuit, if there is no power input to this circuit, there is no field created, and thus no power generated.  you can check this with the key on engine not running, unplug the small wire from the alternator, and see if it has battery voltage at the wire.  if not, there is the root cause of the problem, if it does, and advance auto has checked the alternator and says it is working, then chances are it is, but you still may not be recharging the battery, this is why i am asking how you know the alternator is not charging, just putting a meter across the battery terminals, or watching an in car volt gauge, is not an accurate way to isolate component failure.  high resistance in either the power side, and /or the ground side of the alternator circuit can cause a voltage drop significant enough to not recharge the battery.  let me know if you need more help
X2ED3OrRaa	Your battery also flipped, it is possible that it made electrical contact With the chassis and weakened the battery. It is not dead, just weak. The battery is 12 volts and can be boosted by a car with no harm. Give this a try! GOOD LUCK!                             "BRILLIANT"!!!!
zOtiAN3xaa	you would be okay until you have a crash!!   if you get court they will fine your *** a grand for no insurance. they will cancel you insurance!!   and you know when you do an online quote that says "have you ever had insurance canceled or refused" you have to say YES!! which will put your quote into hyper space!!    i know people that hav put 160 engines in metros!! crazy|`|xDPQ700baa	Look at it this way. Cause an accident and your insurance can be null and void. You then have to deal with the consequences yourself and that can involve being taken to court for the damage you caused to others. If you cannot pay there will be hardship for anyone on the receiving end of your actions no matter how small.    Personally I think people who try to get away with this need the law to come down on them like a ton of bricks. The losers will be the other people not the owner that tries this.    Tell the insurance company. Pay the dues, if people cannot afford the extra insurance with a modded motor then do not do it.|`|AA11256390	It all goes back to the 'if' you get caught! Emissions won't have anything to do with it if they are within the limits set out by the MOT test and pass. The problem is if you have a crash or someone crashes into you. If your car is checked and deemed to have the wrong engine in it then technically you aren't insured and are driving illegally which, not could but will end up at best with you getting points and a fine at worst depending on what caused the crash could result in prison. No insurance is quite a serious offence but as I mentioned at the start it goes back to 'if'|`|4biGrjPkaa	Firstly your engine number wouldnt match your registation document (all engines have a number - same idea as a chassis number), in the event of a nosey cop you'd be in bother - they'd suspect you of all sorts!    If you had a serious crash, the insurance investgator would check it. Bear in mind you might be the best driver on the planet, it just takes some idiot to crash into you and you'd be caught out.    As for the emmissions, thats one area you might not get caught! If the engine is fitted and tuned properly you might not fail the emissions test. And I seriously doubt if any mechanic would care enough to tell the police!    Be honest and up front about any mods, its safer in the long run in my opinion|`|VpZ4QKn5aa	tut tut lol i was thinkin of doin the same fing actuali.    well basicali if u have an accident the insurance usuali check ya car over and its kinda gna be obvious if u got a more powerful engine lol.    one way to get around it may be to say u brought the car like it and never realised ...|`|57RhmPeEaa	it will fail on mot on line check..unless you find bent mot tester...not many left now!!  fines are huge!
5IKJNO7Kaa	I paid a shop $50 to do it, they know what they were doing and it would have taken me a long long time
HFrsH9MRaa	You can do it yourself. And better quality master rebuilds come with instructions. What kind of car is this???? I need to know to give best advice. If this is a foreign car, you are best off by exchanging the master at the dealership. They usually have a decent price on factory rebuilt masters that have been bench tested and certified to be made out of the RIGHT SEALS AND SPRINGS AND OTHER PARTS!!! Also, never use generic brake fluid from a parts store. All DOT 3 fluids are made from different esters and other chemicals. Sometimes there is a chemical reaction that causes brake component damage. If you have a Honda, e.g., go to Honda dealer and buy Honda brake fluid. etc. Never play mix and match with brake fluids. If this is a FORD, but Ford brake fluid. Etc. Doing this way, you just might avoid having to bleed out the entire system, and only bleed things out at the master. You won't have to worry about fluid compatibility. See??? Most master cylinders are held in place by 2 -1/2 inch or 13mm nuts. You will need a line wrench to remove brake lines. You can bleed the master at the brake line connections. Good Luck!!!|`|bvCkplELaa	No this is not something you should attempt yourself as your life and others may be at risk. Yes you can buy it at a parts store (thats what parts stores do) sell car parts. No. it wont.
LCtP3CXEaa	When parking on a hill just ask yourself the question, what will happen if the parking brake does not hold the car and it starts to roll?<br>  <br>  Lets assume you are in the UK and parking 'with the flow'<br>  <br>  Downhill with the wheels turned to the left it hits the kerb so no problem, but turned to the right you will roll out into the road and you do not want that to happen!<br>  <br>  Uphill it is not so important as the front or back will usually hit the kerb fairly soon but basically the opposite is True, turn the wheels to the left and the front moves out into the traffic until the back wheels hit the kerb but this may be too late!

fe896c388193778daefac15405693e34aa	First off if you are on a budget then the engine swap will be cheaper, AND give you more power. The D16y7 is garbage, period, it puts down 92 hp at the front wheels in stock form and a turbo kit on 7 psi (which is the max for the stock motor) will give you about 45 more whp making about 135-140 whp. Now keep in mind that you will need a QUALITY turbo kit from a place like Greddy, Peakboost, Full-Race, or Edelbrock. These kits for your car are between $3,000-$4,000 and you will need to add another $1,000-$1,500 to that for labor to install. If anyone tells you that you can piece together a kit that will last any cheaper is a moron. A quality turbo by itself is between $800-$1000 and a quality manifold is $600-$1000. You cannot skimp on stuff like this if you want it reliable. Now for the engine swap, you can do a B18C1 from a GSR that makes 150ish HP at the wheels for around $3,500 INSTALLED. Now later on if you want any more power from either setup, look at it like this. The D16y7 will be maxed for power without a ton of internal work. It will cost another $6,000 to get 200 whp out of it. Now as far as the B18C1 you can add a bolt on turbo kit, get a thicker head gasket to lower the compression, run 12-13 psi and have 300-320 whp for about $4,000.|`|OgvkF5mvaa	U can trow 1 on there aslong as u dont over boost<br>  so i say 4-6lbs of boost nothing will happen|`|AA11606818	You can run 6lbs or so of boost on the stock rods...<br>  <br>  If you plan on running like 16-18lbs of boost, you definitely need after market rods, and you might want to consider suzuki vitara pistons (yes they fit perfectly) as they have a much lower compression ratio, are very strong, and are cheap. You should consider a d16y8 VTEC head swap (mini-me) and try to find a transmission from a 91 CRX Si as they have the shortest gear ratios of all the D series trannys.  <br>  <br>  The d16y7 is by no means a performance engine and is mainly geared for gas mileage so you will absolutely need a different tranny...can't stress this enough..<br>  <br>  <br>  I have a jackson racing supercharger on my 91 CRX Si with the D16A6 w/stock internals running 6lbs and it's been running boosted for years as an autox car.  <br>  <br>  The key is a good tune.  Running a bit on the rich side is always better than risking detonation.
M79W3Ct9aa	How low you wanna go?  Eibach is usually the company you want for the best lowering springs used in daily driving.  They usually lower the "proper" amount so you don't lose ride quality.|`|HQrMEkm0aa	My choice would be Eibach Pro kit b/c it gives smoother ride, not too low,  and you can still use stock shocks and struts.

Tc2I7znMaa	Hey mate,    I'll try and answer these as simply as possible, the link wasn't working so I'll give you an example of what you might be looking at:    X Subwoofer  Dual 4ohm Voice coil  500watt rms (1000watt peak)      First of all point 1, 2 and 4 are there to help you match your speaker with an amplifier.    1. The number of voice coils and impedance (ohms) a voice coil has basically tells you what the resistance will be when you wire the sub up to the amplifier, this in turn alters the amplifiers output (less resistance = more output).     When you wire two voice coils in parallel (both coils positive-positive and negative-negative) to the amp you effectively half the resistance the amplifier "sees", for example, wiring two 4ohm voice coils the amplifier will "see" a resistance of 2ohms and output a certain amount of watts dependent on the amplifier. However if it is a single 4ohm voice coil subwoofer the resistance to the amplifier will be 4ohms.    Point 2. and Point 4 go hand in hand as the amount of power that the sub can "handle" is determined by the watts rms/peak. The only number you will ever need to look at is the watts RMS, as peak watts mean absolutely nothing. Peak watts are pretty much just an excuse to put big numbers on the box of the speaker. What you need to look at is the wrms handling of the speaker and match that with the rms output of the amplifier.    3. Sensitivity: Most numbers are around     Hope this help you out a bit,    Ben.|`|hIzULU3taa	Check these sites out...it is a good reference.    http://www.bcae1.com/  http://www.termpro.com/articles/articles...

P1Sl55Coaa	I didn't think it was stressful at all.  Most large airlines require previous experience, and some even require you to work in another capacity before you go into flight control.  I worked at a regional, so I don't know about major salaries.  I did see an SWA contract, and they made good money.  Very few dispatchers commute, as they would still need a place to stay in their base.  Pilots can commute because they usually stay in hotels on the company's dime while working.  Dispatchers go home every night, if you live in base.  I've never heard of a dispatcher commuting, but you could do it.  Plan to pay for two places to live.  I don't know why people say it's stressful.  It's a job, and it has it's moments, but most of the time spent at work is pretty boring.

HFrsH9MRaa	David P. is partially right. However, if he has replaced the pump 3 times, then I question the manufacturer of the fuel pump he is using, or the voltage supply to the pump. If there is too much voltage from a bad resistor wire, the pump will repeatedly burn up. Low fuel is NOT the usual problem, as there are 2 fuel lines. One goes to the engine; one comes back from the engine. This causes a constant stirring of gas tank contents and the return hose is usually dumping directly on the pump.  With regard to your Explorer, the next time you get it running, go to a quick lube where someone can see the underside easier. Your fuel pump relies on a good stable power supply. The usual culprit here is a rusty connection where the wiring harness goes into the fuel pump cover. It is so very easy for road salt to get wedged around here with time and cause an unwanted reaction. You should also power wash your engine, and clean BOTH ends of your battery cables with sandpaper to insure a good contact. Good Luck!!|`|nle1v4Yqaa	maibe its because of the cold...|`|qWmwI9PBaa	When was the last time the fuel pump was replaced?  I have a 1996 Chevy truck, and the fuel pump has been replaced 3 times.  This is due to the fuel pump overheating because the vehicle gets run with low amounts of fuel in the tank.  To remedy this, you should not run lower than 1/4 tank of fuel.  The fuel pump is cooled by the gasoline in the tank.  When it gets below a 1/4 tank, there is less cooling capacity therefore letting the pump over heat.<br>  <br>  Like you said, when you hear the fuel pump run, it starts,  but not when you don't hear it run.|`|8m2hnlg7aa	haha I just had a huge fight with my fiance about our suv and it being the fuel pump...

RgWeuTYCaa	I would start at the fuse box. If it has been there for awhile, your car is probably powering it. It he put it in without you knowing, he probably had to work fast. Look for anything that doesn't look right. Wires that are out of place, different color or thickness. If you find anything, you can just trace the wires. It really depends on how determined someone is to not get caught, a gps could really be anywhere. If you are having doubts, ask if he put one on your car and just gauge his reaction.|`|UCzHy3N5aa	If there is a gps unit hidden in your car for any length of time it has to have a power source.

It was niot built for turbo.   people do not realize you cannot add 300Hp to a car made for 160.|`|wra8Q7O3aa	12pleze, he litteraly mentioned an Evolution 9. Evolution 9 does not have 160 hp and it is not naturally aspirated. It is a 287 hp mivec dohc 4g63t awd evo. So check the facts first instead of saying "don't power a 160 hp evo 9". When evo owners see you answer like that, they feel like smacking you for not knowing what kind of power evo has stock... not even close at least.    You can turbo the car because the car already comes with all the nescessary parts and turbo. If your want to get a bigger turbo. Go right ahead. It should be fine. I hear the evo 9 engine can handle up to near 450 bhp fine. If your buying a turbo, I would try to contact the seller or a professional to see what fits the evo 9 right. A lot of business will always try to help you out. Just ask or call them and say: "Which turbo for a evo 9 is good to have near 450hp?" stuff like that and they will help. I won't go to detail on a specific turbo but giving some advice will actually help.
zlPAVkUBaa	Here's my answer, and you won't like it.    Neither one is going to give you a measurable amount of more power.    If you want more power, put a performance exhaust on it.     Cold air intake is a misnomer. You already have a cold air intake if it is stock. With a big K&N on it, it may sound like it has more power, but I would bet your 0-60 time won't change very much, if at all.    One more thing. If you have more HP or it sounds like you do, you will always be on the gas pedal, so your MPG will ultimately suffer.    But, it's your money.|`|cy6ReHYIaa	theyre both about the same as far as engine life and either one can get water in them. prices are roughly the same but short ram costs a little less usually. short ram will improve your low end power, which is something that hondas/acuras definately could use, so i would recommend a short ram intake.|`|7FCEcrQzaa	just get the short ram for now. its perfectly fine and still sounds just as cool.      cold air is way more expensive and doesn't really help all that much, especially for what your doing. In a car show or Professional race yeah maybe it might help a bit but otherwise its more of a nuisance then anything.
081586097f6706be34bbb0a1ac3a3a8baa	You are using good recommended fuel so burning should be right.    Your issue does not relate to Crankshaft position or turbo by pass valve.    It is related to vacuum leakages and in an older car they can be many. There is typical procedure to be adopted for checking air/vacuum leaks, tell your tech 2 follow those, send me your email address and i can send the procedure to you. Rectification and replacement of o-rings wherever the leaks are should solve the problem.|`|fAP8cCyCaa	The most common failures for this condition are the crank sensor and the throttle body.  If you scan the computer there may be a fault code stored. I believe the crank sensor code is P340 and the throttle body code is P1231|`|RjHNxn8zaa	I don't know what "during the lights" means, but if the engine sounds like it is about to stall when you take your foot off of the accelerator, but eventually come back up when you accelerate again, the problem is likely the "turbo bypass valve" (also called "turbo cutoff valve" or "hooter valve").  It releases pressure from the turbo which builds up at idle.  It is a round part with one small vacuum hose and two larger hoses.  Usually it is mounted near the top of the radiator - costs about US$50 and is very easy to replace.  Just make sure you reconnect the two large hoses to the proper connections on the valve.  It is easy to test with a vacuum tester - just connect the tester to the connection with the small hose to see if it holds a vacuum.

This will turn the page notification back on.  Next locate the shock sensor up in the drivers side dash somewhere and use a small flat screwdriver to turn the little yellow sensitivity control seen inside it clockwise to increase the sensitivity of the sensor. If you are not able to locate it the you should take it to a shop to have it done for you.

AA12339318	The LAW in EVERY state says the speed limit is, just that; the speed limit.    And, you CAN get pulled over and cited, even if you are moving at the same speed as everyone else.  In fact, you don't even have to be the fastest car in the bunch to be singled out for a ticket.  Many cops won't do this, unless the flow is moving dangerously fast.  Then a cop will make his presence known and pull someone over for sure.  But, the arguments that "everyone was over the limit," of "other cars were moving faster" will NOT get you out of a ticket, either by the officer or in court.  If you WERE over the limit, you earned the ticket and no excuse is acceptable.    These are the facts and no one can tell you different.  Most states have their vehicle codes posted online, so a quick search should locate the ones in your state.    IF all the traffic around you wants to go faster, YOUR responisbility is to pull into the slow lane and let everyone pass you.  That, too, is the LAW.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	If you try to do the speed limit when the flow is greater, you will cause an accident. It may be wrong, but you really don't have much of a choice.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I prefer to go with or close to the speed of traffic. It is usually safer that way then going the speed limit. If you prefer to go the speed limit, stay in the right lane and be prepared to see some middle figures, flashing headlights, and beeping horns at you. And on a side note, 10 miles over the speed limit is not likely to result in a ticket. Depending on the speed of traffic, if the traffic is flowing at 15 over, then any speeds around 20 over are the drivers cops target, basically anybody moving faster then the flow of traffic. And if you're not in the far right lane, if you're in the middle and especially far left lane going the speed limit, you might get a ticket for holding up traffic or failure to keep right, as the signs "Slower Traffic Keep Right" mean, which as nothing to do with the speed limit. A lot of people misinterpret those signs thinking as long you're going the speed limit, you don't have to be in the right lane. That's wrong. The sign means if you're moving slower than other traffic (even if you're going the speed limit), you should stay in the right lane (unless passing), and allow faster traffic to pass.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I was taught in driver's ed (in 1978) that I should follow the flow of traffic even if it was above the speed limit but to follow the speed limit when the traffic was at a level where they could pass me safely although the article below says it is illegal to exceed the speed limit at any time:    http://www.pe.com/columns/on_the_road/st...    fight amongst yourselves as to which is correct|`|JLayHNZCaa	You are correct.  Flow of traffic never makes it okay for you to speed.  The police may look the other way, but they never have to.  To be legal, do not speed.  Your BF is wrong on this one.|`|PuqVhzY9aa	I am pleasantly amazed of the maturity of everyone answering this question!  I live in Knoxville, and I've only seen literally a HANDFUL of people who actually go the speed limit.  However, there IS a reason for this:    If you go the speed limit on, say, the interstate, you're never going to witness another do-gooder/law abider because you're both going the same speed.  So if you're going the speed limit and someone gets onto the highway you're on via an entrance ramp or whatever 5 miles ahead, you'll never run into them.  However, you will witness a lot of morons along your journey who are either going well-below the speed limit or highly above it.    If you go above the speed limit/go with the flow of traffic, even if everyone else around you is going with the flow of traffic, then you are extremely likely to cause or be a part of a wreck.  If you go the speed limit and find yourself nervous because people are switching lanes at the last second without using their blinker and etc., don't worry, you're the one going the constant, consistent speed, and not all speeders are complete idiots.  They'll evaluate you and the cars around you, see you're going much slower but at a consistent rate, pass you uncomfortably fast, and move on.  It's not right, but it's the safest thing you can do is to go the speed limit regardless of what everyone else is going.|`|ff3246ab4193235aa580f70384f57b09aa	You should follow the speed limit but they won't pull you over if you are going with the flow of traffic|`|AtRpdjczaa	You always have to follow the speed limit.  Just because the rest of traffic is going 70 in a 55 zone, doesn't mean a cop is not going to pull anybody over.  And if you are the lucky one, the "Everybody was going 70 so i was going 70 too" excuse isn't going to fly.|`|0K4ylh5Uaa	I prefer to run with the flow of traffic but here's the trick. Run just a little bit slower and you won't be in the way as much and the cops won't pull you over for going over the speed limit if other traffic is moving faster than you are.|`|xD8T4dY3aa	In Western Australia, it is illegal to exceed the speed limit. Full stop.   It says it in every edition of the driving handbook issued by the Traffic branch since I can remember.  Under no circumstances is it considered acceptable to exceed the speed limit or drive dangerously.  Speed limits always take priority over the 'flow of traffic', insofar as those already speeding are breaking the law and there are no exceptions made on the grounds of trying to keep within the flow of traffic. If the limit is 80, drive 80. Those swerving around you and tailgating you should not in the least influence your driving.  Many people are of the opinion that if you are tailgated, that you should speed up to widen the gap between you and the tailgater.  This is an incorrect assumption and you must either change lanes or pull over, allowing the tailgater to pass. It is then advised that you contact authorities if the tailgater was reckless and hostile or in the very least leave adequate distance before pulling onto the road reserve after them.  Laws aside, common sense dictates this to be the case.
ssYUtrQ1aa	The Wrangler, hands down. The Wrangler has an enormous following and deep rooted history. Of course I'm assuming you already weighed out your options as far as practicality and whatnot. It will be one of the most fun vehicles you have ever been in. It's easy to work on, very tough and durable, and can offroad like a dream if you're into that sort of thing. The newer version comes with beefed up 4x4 drivetrain standard, and some i think come with special offroad accessories (especially the Rubicon). The new multi-panel hard top is awesome in my opinion, it seems to be easy to remove and will last longer than any soft top. The doors are still removable too. This is my fav part of the wrangler. The newer wrangler is designed to be more comfortable as well (older ones were more stiff but were made with older tech to enhance off-road driving). The Patriot is an aerodynamically challenged car, like all the other "cross-over" garbage driving down the road. Nuff said.|`|gsQU85fIaa	neither they both suck cj-7 rulez|`|RbsRpcIyaa	One is an actual Jeep, the other is a warmed-over Chrysler product.

Who knows if they'll survive this recession.)|`|xJukjCWiaa	Well if your minds made up go with the wrangler.

Vehicles are meant to be warmed up gradually, not in ten seconds or less.  But I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.  It could be she is having start up issues.  In which case it could be almost anything.  Most likely it could be plugs.  Tell her to take it to a mechanic for a diagnostic.

VuIxxJvqaa	Most of the time, on modern cars, you need to buy at least the blank from the dealership and have it cut somewhere else. They are a special key and they are only for sale from the dealer and you need to provide your VIN number, because in some cases, there is security devices in the key.    You should be able to phone the dealership and give them your credit card number and have them post the key to you. It might be easier and cheaper for you.|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	some keys are not easy to duplicate. maybe that is why there are none around.

Another option, if you get desperate is to have your keys changed and just have copies made right there.|`|sqA1kVcnaa	that's going to depend on if there is an Electronic chip in it. some cars have this chip I think to prevent theft, if that's the case you will have to go to the dealer, if not you could probably just go to any hardware store and have them carve you one, if they say they cant have them explain why that will tell you where to go.|`|gsQU85fIaa	WALMART|`|HhxIceRTaa	A locksmith can make you an emergency key just for the lock in case you lock your other keys in the car. This key can be made for about $5, but it can't be used in the ignition of most new cars. They need what's called a transponder key. These are special keys with microchips in them. If you use a regular copy, your car will stop after a minute and you'll have to have it towed to a dealer and it will be a big, expensive mess. Locksmiths should be able to make you a transponder key, though, for $75-100. A dealer might be more expensive.|`|aGLAt8tpaa	Try Ace Hardware. They can cut and program the new chip keys.

Every 3000 miles OR 3 months, whichever comes first. Oil can loose its properties if it sits too long whether the car is driven a lot or not.

The more I read, the more I am impressed with the 250 Ninja.  Hope these article help you to see what a rider is capable of with a small machine.  Good Luck  PS I beg to differ with the comments made by Bart and Chris.    Dr. Evan Yeager has done numerous Iron Butt rides on a 250 Ninja.  Please read second URL below.  Dr. Yeager has crossed the country in under 50 hours thus securing a 50CC certificate.  The Dr. has secured a Saddle Sore 1000 certificate.  1000 miles traveled in 24 hours.  He also was awarded a Bun Burner 1500 certificate for 1500 miles covered in 36 hours.  These 250s are more than capable of taking to the highway.

But the old models will cost a TON less, and parts for them are everywhere.    and like I said, have realistic expectations about the performance you'll get from a 250cc bike.  They're great for learning on, and a light rider could easily find one perfectly adequate for daily use his or her entire life.    but if you're heavier, plan to routinely carry a passenger, or do more than a little highway riding, you'll want something a bit bigger.  Even so, the 250 holds its resale value VERY well, so you can't really go wrong with one.

jGmMoPrsaa	Hi  Just type in your browser lpg conversion,and several sites will come up with all the details for your vehicle to be converted,another cheap fuel to run on is bio-diesel|`|uFQFRdczaa	Gasoline is rated by "octane," and most people think higher is better, right?  Octane is a measure of how hard it is to get the gasoline to auto-ignite, because the last thing you want in your gasoline engine is premature ignition.  Diesel is the opposite. It's rated by "cetane" which is a measure of how easily it auto-ignites, which is what you need for a good running diesel.  A tiny bit of gas mixed with a whole lot of diesel won't do much besides lower the cetane number, it may make the engine harder to start, especially cold.  A lot of gas will mean the engine won't run at all.    On the other hand, your injection pump is probably not designed to handle either gasoline or alcohol.  If the seals in the injection pump get dried out by alcohol, or dissolved in gasoline, that would be a major problem.  Injection pumps are expensive.    Personally I wouldn't risk it.  I'd pump out the gasoline into a container (probably easiest to disconnect a fuel line and just turn the key to run) and then refill with diesel.
jfnJKxkAaa	new vehicles are not as solid as older ones; supposed to improve safety.    The vehicle is built to crumple when hit from the front or rear so that it helps absorb impact so that your body decelerates at fewer G's, minimizing the risk of internal injury in a high speed collision.|`|gsQU85fIaa	r u sure u were only doing 30 mph looks like u were going much faster|`|AA12161396	When I think 4 Runner......I think tank is about the last thing i would describe them as.....maybe a plastic tank?|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Physics.

r9H8AXIsaa	You have drum brakes on the back.  Just for your information, the rust on the outside has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the brakes inside.      On the worst side, you will need both new drums that could cost up to $90 for each side.  You may be able to have them turned for less, you need to ask the mechanic if there is still enough metal left.    You will then need new shoes.  These could cost as much as $80 for a set (should be able to do both sides).      The mechanic may charge 2 hours or so for labor -- that's another $150 or more.      Added up, the high end of this could run $410+.  Don't approve of anything else like new springs but he should pack the wheel bearings while the hub is off for free.      Your mechanic may also recommend the cylinders be replaced or rebuilt.  Don't pay more the $30 each -- complete with parts.    If your mechanic goes over $500 with an estimate, go somewhere else.  You should at least get a baseline pricing at Ford.

HpwyYmoIaa	you can get an evo 8, like a 2005 i think, and itll beat it stock. theres a video on youtube of a evo 8 racing a murcielago around a track and beating it. with an evo X though you will need an upgraded turbo or a good tune minimum|`|ZBVMT11maa	if you have that much money i would def talk to AMS. they have the the quickest evo's on the street right now. over 1000hp    also check out evolutionm.net    looking you would be looking at building a motor, bigger turbo maybe gt35r, fuel pump, injectors, larger FMIC, and def a good TUNE and doing some expenstive suspension mods.     but good luck thats a lot of money  to play with and manye different ways to planning.|`|wra8Q7O3aa	You can, if you can get a cheap evo but not a evo x. Get an older version evo like evo 8. Then hook it up from there, because you save more money to spend on aftermarkets. Either a 30k evo x + 10k aftermarkets OR 25k evo 8/9 mr + 15k aftermarkets. The extra 5000 can help out a lot.|`|SaMfS6RQaa	You have no chance vs. any lambo on a track. Especially with only 10k in upgrades consider more money to spend and look for a JDM tunners.

You will have a real performer and u might have 5 extra grand to spend on upgrades. That will get you closer to you Dads tail lights but to pass him/if he is a driver of course/ you will need skills, a good tunner and a lot of practice especially if your first car is evo. these are different vehicles to drive.

DRRxeUq0aa	my best guesses are      round thing with 2 bolts you refer to is the starter soenoid and that would come off of the positive side of the battery and then run to the starting motor(usually the left bolt will hook up to the positive battery terminal and the right bolt will go to the starter, but no promises cause i dont know what kind of bike you have). to check if that is it connect the wires as i mentioned, turn key to ON position and bridge the connection between the two bolts with a screwdriver or something. if the bike tries to start, then that is the solenoid.      Tyhe black box I would guess is either your CDI box or more likely your regulator rectifier since there are only three wires running to it. if there are three connections it is probably the CDI if it is one three wire pin connectio it is probably the regulator rectifier    What everyone else said about ground is correct|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	as far as i know there has not been a vehicle-car, truck, or motorcycle  that has not wired with negative ground ground since the early 70's. so if you look at the battery you will see positive and negative.     The positive terminal  is normally fused.   The negative terminal goes to ground    the little round thing you refer to with bolts sticking out of  may be a circuit breaker|`|VuIxxJvqaa	To be honest, without knowing what type of bike it is, it makes it rather hard.    For starters, its Battery.    Next, If something sparks when you connect it to metal, there must be power running through it. Perhaps the terminal on the battery you think is negative, is in fact, positive.    Not being disrespectful, but you do know that the positive terminal has a PLUS signal ( + ) and the negative symbol is ( - )    Fuses should be connected to a positive side, there is no need for the negative side to be fused.    As far as the little round thing and the box with three wires, I wouldn't be touching any of them until you fully know and understand what they do and what they are. If you make a mistake with the electrics, the results can be very bad.    It may be better for you to pay a auto electrician to correct the wiring problems.|`|ktMefP0oaa	HUH? yeah the frame is ground, other than that I don't have a clue what you are saying, if the ground wire sparked touching the frame you really got problems.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	did you take this bike apart an dnow you don tknow how to put it back or what i got one in a box i never seen before frame was only thing that wasnt in box i was riding it the next day  come on man if it sparks its not right an dbest you just buy a repair manaul your going to need on eif your wanted to work on it much cant really guess how to make repairs you life depends on your bike and pushing it  is not as fun

v8TWvtQgaa	Yep it's fine. A car only needs to meet the standards for the year it was made in.    Like it's a law new cars has to have air bags now, but you can drive older ones w/o air bags.     older 30's, 40's, 50's cars didnt have seat belts and cause they didnt have them in at the time of production, it's legal to drive today on the roads w/o seat belts.     Same even with blinkers, but if you drive an old car that don't have blinkers you must use the old hand motions.. (arm straight out = left hand turn, arm out and up at 90* = right hand turn,  arm out and dow at 90* = stopping)|`|HpwyYmoIaa	its legal, they werent necessary until after the 67 year cars were made so if you drive a car from 67 its fine but a car newer will have to have one cause it came from the factory with it|`|QnCmowfmaa	Of course it is.I drive mine all the time and the only light the cops seem to care about is the license plate light.|`|a70d82417eb7a74192f967dcdc832b20aa	It's legal, no worries.|`|4a0Akgieaa	Yes it is legal.

Ignore all other suggestions.|`|daw140ceaa	It's a really simple fix.    The Chrysler adapter harness you used to install the deck has a blue wire in it. Naturally, you connected it to the blue wire from your head unit.  This is the remote turn-on wire for the Infinity amplifier.  It needs to be connected to the blue/white wire from the head unit.  The head unit's blue wire is a power antenna wire, so it's only turning on the Infinity amp when the tuner is selected.    Connect the blue wire from the adapter harness to the blue/white wire from your deck, and it will fix the problem completely.|`|LExEl5k1aa	if your factory amp in your truck was bad then you wouldnt hear anything, even the radio.

VuIxxJvqaa	It sounds as if either the speaker cable has a split in it and it is touching on metal somewhere or when you bolt the speaker in place, the terminals are touching on the door somewhere and causing the speaker to short out.

Some examples :baby on lap, feeding baby on lap, talking on cell phone and putting on makeup. Reading the paper or map. These are just a Few. Anything that can distract or obstruct a driver from driving safely is illegal, Therefore IT is illegal. I believe talking on a hand held cell phone should be illegal?   Use of headphones are illegal, not cleaning the snow off your windows and lights is also illegal! Many people do all these thing, but it  doesn't make it legal!!'

Plain and simple. The driver's position must be unobstructed and nothing must be held between the driver's person and the steering wheel. This is especially the case with automobiles equipped with airbags.|`|o3Z0Xrjsaa	Here's a thought. Would you drive with your baby on your lap? No as the baby would go flying through the air if you were to get into crash plus it is illegal to have child in your lap in all 50 states and even in most countries. So the answer to this would be NO. A dog is the same thing as a baby and in a crash would go flying into the windscreen/shield or even worse out of the vehicle all together and it is most likely illegal in all states. So what to do? Buy a dogie seat belt at Pets-mart or Pet Co. For a 10lb dog cost is ~$25.00+- and will help save the life of your dog in the event of a crash.

In the 40's cars had very little in the way of safety devices. Probably the only thing on these cars that helped with safety was headlights and brake lights, so that drivers were able to see at night and other road users could see when drivers were stopping.    In the 50's some cars were fitted with a device called (in some countries) trafficators (google it, may be different where you live) and they were a reflective metal level that was usually mounted on the B pillar of the car, and worked on a switch, it worked like todays turn signal does, but instead of a flashing light, a reflective metal bar appeared on the appropriate side.     Cars were also built stronger, as there were more and more cars on the road and car crashes were becoming a common thing. This was also for safety.    In the 60's most cars were fitted with seatbelts as well as electric turn signals. Some cars also were fitted with safety glass, or laminated glass, so that if the window was smashed, instead of shards of glass busting out, the glass would stay together.    70's saw many new safety features on some cars. Some European cars were fitted with 4 wheel disc brakes, which helped cars stop more effectively.    80's saw electronic technology introduced, such as anti lock brakes, which again reduced braking distances.    90's lead to many technological breakthroughs, like airbags becoming standard on most cars, traction control, etc. The inclusion of side intrusion bars in doors, etc.|`|0B1elHiUaa	Focus on one safety feature such as air bags, seat belts or anti lock brakes.  If you are talking to teens then i would go with seat belts (since most don't like to wear them) and start with statistics. Talk about development, laws, lives saved during crashes by the safety device.  Wikipedia.org has a good page on seat belts and links to government and other related websites.  End your speech with a common seat belt slogan (Click it or ticket, seat belts save lives, etc.) if you choose to speak on seat belt safety.

After you get out of the military you will need to get your A&P license to work on the civilian side of aviation. The good thing though is that the GI bill will cover school and you can get your license in only 18 months if you go to a technical school.

Work for a company like boeing, raytheon, L3, overseas.  You'll do the same job you did in the military but with twice the pay.  Then find a private jet owner and maintain his jet/jets.

It is probably a contract for him to repair your car and once its faxed to the insurance company, its too late.    Also, if your insurance company recommended that particular shop, it may be very hard (even if you didn't sign the paper) to go to another shop. Usually if there is a recommended repairer in the area, that is where your insurance company wants your car to go and since they are paying for it, that's where it goes.    2-3 weeks is a normal repair time, depending on parts stock and damage done. Some times the car needs to be assessed before work can commence and it may take that long for the assessor to come and look at your car.|`|lm0nlP04aa	yes if they haven't started any work you can switch.

When it expires it will cost u 5 dollars to renew it. Only if u r 18, is when u can get ur license whenever u feel u r ready.

F9WyYPYlaa	Due to the age of the system and it's current selling prices , I would say you can get $65 dollars a piece for the subs and around $150 for the amp.  The wear and the conditions in which they have been kept can drastically cause damage to the coils.  I would advise testing the system and then if in good condition selling it for $250 bucks.  I know this may sound low, but technology has changed alot and you can get sytems bigger and better then what you ariginal purchase price was.|`|FTHswQIKaa	Try and post it at ValueJockey.com.

I bought a 12" Punch HE2 sub on Craigslist in a sealed box for $35 a year back.  Granted, the guy was selling a little on the low side (woofer was near perfect & he had it wired in series to an 8 ohm load to the terminal cup) - but the ad ran 5 days when I saw it and nobody had purchased it.  Oddly enough I got tired of the sub a few months later and sold it for $60, but the listing was up for a month.  I was willing to sit & wait for my price - even though it might take awhile.    Point being - most people don't associate with the older RF stuff, unless you're a Rockford Fosgate purist.

u0lRzaXSaa	There is a reservoir attached to your radiator that hold about 2 quarts of antifreeze. The antifreeze goes in this reservoir.|`|UycnSRXbaa	POP the bonnet open.  Look 8 inches to the right.  That tape is the radiator, open it up and pour it in.    Do you really need to put antifreeze in it? here is a good (but disgusting) way of testing for it.  Dip you finger in the radiator water and put a tiny amount on your tongue. if you get a sweet taste, your existing antifreeze is good, if you get a vingerey/sour taste, you antifreeze is gone.  This will not effect your health in way, as long as you drink gallons of the stuff.    BTW, if it is gone you will need to drain it all out before you new fluid in.
Tc2I7znMaa	It's always best to quote the watts rms when you are ever talking about car audio as the "max" watts mean absolutely nothing, just a reason for the manufacturers to put big numbers on the box.    The Kenwood subs you have are Dual 4ohm voice coils and can handle 400wrms each. It would be best to get an amplifier that can output 800wrms @ either 1ohm, if you wire each coil in parallel to the amp (preferred), or 4ohms, if you wire the subs in series/parallel to the amp.    If you wanted to keep the Kenwood theme running and have big plans for the future i would suggest the Kenwood X1200M and wire the subs in series/parallel. If that's a bit expensive the KAC-9104D is also a good choice, with this amplifier you will need to wire the coils in parallel to achieve a 1ohm load. This amp is rated at 900wrms @ 1ohm but if you set the gain properly an extra 50wrms each wont harm the subs. Those would be my two suggestions.    Even if you didn't want to go Kenwood and amplifier with 800wrms output @ 1ohm or 4ohms would suit your needs. MTX, Poineer, RF, and Jaycar are all good choices.    Good luck,    Ben.
AA11606818	In my opinion, the chances of getting the wheels stolen is significantly less with locks.  Not to say they can't be stolen, but it takes far more time to get locks off, even if you have a master key set.

IF...n if ONLY ur doing diz bcuz yo door speakers is pushn out bass n all u want is mids n tweets in yo door speakers..u need a amp with built in CROSSOVER..which separate the bass to yo sub n to yo door speakers.     trust me this works i just did my car today n i love the sound comin from my door speaker n all the bass from my sub..    good luck i hope i helped u..contact me if u have any questions|`|iga1jl2saa	Yes it's just like your sub amp, but for the remote wire just tap it from your sub amp.     Your head unit only has 1 set of rear inputs so you'll need to get a rca splitter at the new amp.    splitter = 1 female into 2 males and you'll need 2 of them. 1 for each channel.

hO1J8CTOaa	no you cannot obtain a driver license over the internet.|`|yaaNbLeyaa	In Texas, you can take driver's ed through an approved school or by ordering the course from the State and having an older person (like a parent) teach the course to you, like home schooling.  With the latter, the parent/teacher keeps a log showing you've met the requirements to prove to the State that you've done everything you're supposed to do.  Either way, you still have to take the test in-person.  The good thing about taking it through a driving school is that you take your test there, instead of at the DMV, which is where you'll have to take it if you teach yourself.    I have two driving teenagers and we sent both to a private driving school.  We know people who've taught their kids with the State course, however, and they've done just fine. Call the DMV or go online to find costs for their program.

If it isnt-and the price is right--have it checked over by a mechanic--change the oil for sure and check the brakes..I wish I knew the year and set-up and i could elaborate better. from personal experience of owninig a Construction Company and having owned many trucks i will comment about my personal experience--I bought a basic 4 cylynder stick S-10 new in 2001 and now am at the 175K mark.It has been a great little beater throughout the years--all the maintaince has been routine---the biggest expense was having a timing chain replaced at 120K that left me stuck for the first time- I ignored the telltale slapping noise of the timing chain for 10 thousand miles.before she skipped on me. My Clutch is due--but its easy and it dont owe it anything--I change the oil every 4K--other then that shes been a great little trooper-way better then any Ranger I owned. The 4 wheel drive versions have some intake gasket problems  but if the price is right it is well worth fixing.

This site explains the "BIG 3" upgrades.    http://www.sounddomain.com/ubbthreads.ph...|`|xepff87Haa	Alpine X nice... the amp. will power you speakers but not well it will cut off and on if you turn it up too high. When buying an amp. for your subs make sure the amp.RMS voltage is the same or higher as both the subs RMS voltage doing so will help you get the best sound. Using 0/0 wire might be over doing it but 4 gauge will be good enough. Capacitors will be something you might want to look into your amp will be using a lot juice from you battery so my suggestion is to take some time and look into that...

AA12034546	Volvo's 740 model was one of the good ones. The turbo version was a bit more complicated therefore a little more expensive to maintain. Volvo owners do tend to run up the miles on their cars but reliability has alot to do with that. The older Volvos were almost bulletproof. Having said all of that, if you find a good candidate, ask the owner for maintenance records, very important to know ahead of time what you can expect out of the car. Also, have the car inspected by a reputable mechanic who knows Volvos. Since you are considering a turbo, know that turbo-equipped engines need more frequent oil changes and turbo replacement can be expensive. If you decide against a turbo model, know that the 740 is not an acceleration champ by any menas but they are durable, comfortable cars that will keep up with anything else on the road.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	the car may do you ok, but 2 things to look at when buying an older car of any kind. First thing is how old it is. That car is 19 years old. The second thing is it has a turbo and if that thing goes bad, it will cost you about as much as you are paying for the car to replace it and also if it goes out that car won't have "ANY" power to speak of.|`|UKNmZsU5aa	turbos can be troublesome.|`|VuIxxJvqaa	Your future brother in law mustn't think too much of you if he tells you to buy a Volvo.

VuIxxJvqaa	For starters there is no such thing as 'mild' lifters. Lifters are either hydraulic or solid. If you plan on a having the motor basically stock, you should use hydraulic.    A mild cam is sensible, headers are a good idea, if you mate them to a performance exhaust. New carb and manifold is a good idea too.    Its a pretty normal build, nothing too wild, and it should give you a sweet motor.|`|ACzRWfDdaa	Mild lifters?  I think you mean cam, it's all good.  If you are stuck on the 305 that will be a decent combination.  You'll be after the low end and mid-range.  To really wake up the 305, you could bump up the compression and do something about the crappy heads they all came with.  There is a way to make L31 vortec heads work, but you'll have to do some research.  The small bore is one of the reasons the 305 is limited in cylinder head choices.  Just don't over cam the motor and be sure to stick to the appropriate sized carb.  600cfm is about where you should be.|`|TREuo6hKaa	just go with the 350.  you'll be glad you did.    305s have no balls|`|GrgNm1Ofaa	Make sure those headers match the low to mid range power you're building for, besides that it sounds nice.  Call comp cams or crane cams, etc to help you with your cam choice.  And you don't need new heads to wake the old girl up a bit.  You'll be very surprised if the engine is stock now and after all that modification - my guess is you could add about 40-60 hp onto your current engine with those ideas.    For headers, get Tri-Y's (or 4 into 2 into 1's), not 4 into 1's.  This helps with low end power, also get 1 5/8 inch inside diameter primary pipes; longer collectors (secondary's) - 24-36 inches will give you more power on your engine than shorter ones.  (short secondaries are for higher revving engines like 6,500 rpm+)    Also think about getting a real aggressive rear gear (unless you do a lot of highway driving). Like a 3.93 or 4.11 - this way your off the line 0-60 bursts will be nasty fast because your engine will be built for that low end power.

78e4081014f25f2f27e0302c168080c5aa	They are very good vehicles until they get into the higher mileages.  They will run flawlessly until they get to around 150,000 miles.  There is a major problem on the 2.0 liter engines involving dropped valve seats.  It happens a lot, and not an uncommon problem.  I see a lot of these engines with dropped valve seats at or above 150,000 miles, which usually destroys the  4 piston and the cylinder head, as a matter of fact I am installing a Jasper rebuilt engine into one at the moment for this very concern.  If it is low mileage it is a very good vehicle, no question, but at or over 150K, I would say no unless you get for a price that can afford a major engine repair in the near future.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	The earlier Escort had a lot of problems. but the later models from about 1995 up are fare little cars if you keep them maintenanced properly.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	They're GREAT !

VuIxxJvqaa	DeTomaso Pantera. Awesome supercar!    Engine and gearbox wise, you shouldn't have too many problems. The engine is a 351 Cleveland motor, which are plentiful, spare parts aren't a problem at all, Gearbox is a ZF transaxle, once again, you shouldn't have too hard a time finding spare parts, if it does break.    All the other parts, I imagine would need to be sourced through a Pantera club.

One review said that they broke down at Ford's testing track when they were brand new cars being reviewed. Very poor quality car. It uses a Ford V8 engine too.

f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	Insurance companies do not care about points. All they care about is what you were convicted for. Careless Driving, with or without points, is a serious conviction in the insurance company's eyes. Yes your rates will go up, but no one here can say by how much since no one here knows how you are currently rated with your current insurer. Call your broker/agent and ask them.

Also about the speakers, dont get 3way.  most ppl think "wow, more speakers in one, it has to sound better!"  but that is not true!    If you want it to sound amazing, get component speakers.  These use seperate mids, tweets, and crossovers, and will handle more power, get louder while staying clearer, and are cleaner....    One other thing.

lZsbIEo8aa	You might not need a CDL for that truck. You need to look on the driver door jamb or on the door itself for the manufacturer sticker. It will have the VIN, and a bunch of weights and such. If the first one (GVWR) is 26001 or more, then you need the CDL. Doesn't matter if it has air brakes or not. If it is under, then you can drive it with a regular license - unless you are hauling haz-mat.    If you need a CDL, and are caught without one, you face stiff fines, and your license will get suspended. The company that lets you drive the vehicle also faces the same fines.  The truck will not be allowed to continue without a licensed driver, and will probably get impounded by the police officer that stops you. Again, the company that lets you drive doesn't want to risk losing their truck and load, so if you are working for a reputable company, I am sure you are legal. If you are working for a shady company, I would tip off a local officer, and let them "stop" you. This type of company should not be in business.|`|zeXMAsF7aa	you will get a ticket and will probable have to park the truck and have someone pick it up.  you need a cdl for anything over 26000 s  and you need airbrake endorsment .|`|d4af98bef4634072715e0b3c20d8beefaa	You will need an air brake endorsement and from what you have said a class B cdl. Study the manual especially the air brakes. Pass the test. Otherwise if you are stopped it is a monster ticket. I am surprised your boss would let you do that. For the air brakes only I think it is a written test. CDL licenses are the same regardless of state. A CDL test has three parts the inspection for air brakes remember compressor max air pressure is between 100-125 psi. The low air buzzer has to go off at 60psi or above,the parking brake has to pop up between 20-45 psi and when the brake is applied no more than 4 psi/min leakage.|`|jFwuiRKxaa	You get a ticket and they take you off the truck right there.

8ifKojOXaa	Yes for sure it could be bad gas or moister in the fuel tank, I'd add some some Lucas gas treatment to it and probably change the gas filter on it too.   If you've driven the vehicle with low gas tank levels in past or bought some fouled gas or haven't changed the gas filter on a yrly basis any of them could cause such a problem.     Hope that helps and best of luck.By the way I would shop around for fuel filters bec their prices can vary and once you run a few gas tanks up on it change the gas filter again.|`|OpqUaHtsaa	yeah sounds like it is kinda floodin out or something take it to the local mechanic that'll be your best bet buddy|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	sure it happens more in winter months than summer so try a bottle or two of fuel treatment about 5 bucks might fix it|`|FJefmjNIaa	What kind of gas?

fl60KL8oaa	Nope!|`|lsjMmZuiaa	are you interested in the weight due to how the bike feels, or how the bike accelerates?    if you're concerned with acceleration, don't look at weight - look at power-to-weight ratio.    if you're concerned with being able to hold the bike up, etc. - don't only look at the weight in kg or lbs; you have to consider center of gravity as well.  The best way to determine which bike "feels" the lightest is to throw a leg over each and compare.
BgwTxzEFaa	Park/Neutral Switch Input Circuit fault is the second code. Has to do with your neutral safety switch circuit, possibly shorted to ground.    The first one means either the purge valve for the evap system, or the vent solenoid itself has failed.  This really should not cause a starting issue however, as it is just part of the pollution control system.  There is a purge valve that cycles the fuel vapors that concentrate in the tank through a carbon canister to neutralize them so that when you open your gas cap you dont vent the vapors into the air.|`|HlozHgwIaa	First code could be a bad gas cap. Try replacing it with a new one. It may not be making a proper seal at the gas tank.

You can compare how much you would pay for full coverage of this car using this tool - autoinsurance.noneto.com|`|UZ2FZzsjaa	Hi Ariana i hope this answers your question.  The most significant aspect that differentiates a person who owns a car and a person who takes it on a loan is gap insurance. Gap insurance policy actually covers the gap between the lease amount and the amount provided by the insurance company at the times of vehicle theft or damage. This particular insurance coverage type has been designed so as to protect the investment.    There are several companies offering gap insurance. Many times, gap insurance is included in the lease agreement. Gap insurance is required when the buyer has taken the vehicle on lease without even making 20 percent down payment. Other situations where gap insurance is required include car finance that has been continuing for the last four years or when the existing car loan amount also includes the debt on the previous car.    According to the market, the value of a vehicle depreciates as soon as it is purchased from the dealer. This value is further lowered once the vehicle meets an accident. Depending on the damage and the cause of the accident, insurance companies determine the amount to be reimbursed towards insurance claim. After deducting this amount from the actual loan amount, the consumer is now left with the option of paying the remaining loan amount. This amount could be substantial on numerous occasions that could leave the customer in a financial crunch. Gap insurance protects customers from such situations.    However, gap insurance is not required for every individual who has purchased a vehicle on loan. Gap insurance is not required when the regular insurance policy has the option of paying off the entire finance amount in case of damage or theft.|`|AKW3fxF1aa	Gap insurance covers the difference between the payoff of your vehicle and what the insurance will pay if the vehicle is totaled.

A 2004 Chevy Cavalier is more like it. Because new drivers are hard on cars and until they have a few years experience under their belt they should not have a new car. The Cavalier is actually the same car as a Pontiac G5 underneath anyway.    But if the parents are casual enough with money to get their teen a new car, the Pontiac G5 is a good choice.
5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	The metal piece is called a male quick disconnect. Every sub box has them on the backside of the terminal cup. It is a very common connector for speakers. Go to an auto parts store or car audio store or Radio Shack and buy some female quick disconnect terminals. You will crimp these onto the speaker wire you will use on the subs then plug them onto the male terminals in the box.|`|VuIxxJvqaa	Its better to not solder anything, some companies void warranty if they are soldered.    If there is a nut and bolt, you should get a eyelet type crimp connector and crimp the connector onto your wire, and then place the eyelet over the bolt and tighten the nut down.|`|GbZ4axroaa	ok is there a whole where the nut and bolt is unscrew the nut and bolt and see if there is one. if it is there strip the wire back a little put it into the whole and screw it together.
AA11923183	you can splice your speaker wires youre running your tweeters with into any other speaker wire in your vehicle. and if you're planning on running an amp to them you dont even have to do that.. just have an aftermarket radio with amp hookups or get a line output converter to run it with a stock radio..|`|bfxerFkeaa	why not install 3 way speakers....they have the tweeters inside the speaker.  less work and same sound.|`|HVQFVtelaa	Eddie, your motivation for installing factory replacement speakers with coaxials, then adding separate tweeters is unclear. Deyon actually made a good point (assuming he ment triaxials) because the installation would be easier and not modify the interior of your car. And yes, triaxials are theoretically component speakers, having separate drivers and crossover comonents. Having said that, lets address your original question. Assuming you already have the coaxials, and have a very low budget but want more high end, yes it will work. The easiest and cheapest way is the ONE exception to mysticmasters observation about unprotected tweeters. Motorola made a 3 1/4 " piezo electric tweeter having internal crossover protection, and YES, is designed to connect straight to the speaker wires without damage. They are dirt cheap, (about 5 bucks a pair on the internet) and are almost impossible to blow. Good luck.                                                 Magyver|`|AA12046543	OK, both of the last answers were wrong.  For one, coaxil speakers (or ones with tweeters in the middle) do NOT sound nearly as good as component.  Component speakers have a seperate tweeter, midbass, and crossover network, and delivers a much more accurate, clean sound.  If you get component, like i said, tweeters are seperate, so that will take care of your problem.    The other person was wrong because you cannot splice speaker wires and run the tweets off the same line as the other speaker.  That would send midbass into the tweeter and blow it very fast.  Get components!    Good brands of components are:  Kicker  Alpine  Pioneer  RE  Hifonics    These are just a few, all which you can find in the price range of 100-300 for a pair.  They may cost barely more, but definitely worth the money!|`|Tc2I7znMaa	Hey mate,    It can work i guess but it wont be easy to do. What you are thinking about is buying a pair of co-axials (the speakers with the tweeters in the middle) and putting another pair of tweeters somewhere else? You will need to attach the tweeters speaker wires to the small crossover on the two-way speaker and I don't think you will be pleased with the results. What you need is to buy a pair of component speakers or "splits".    When you buy a pair of component speakers (which I think is what you are after) it will come with 3 parts. First is the main speaker, this is what plays your mid-bass, then your tweeter, which plays the highs. Then there will be a small box-like thing that has a circuit board and a heap of wires/capacitors etc. This is called a crossover and is used to split the high and low frequencies that it receives to the right speakers.    To wire these up together there will be 6 points on the crossover, wire 2 up to the amp, 2 up to the mid-bass speaker and 2 up to the tweeter. The speakers will definitely come with installation instructions so it will tell you what goes where on that.    Good luck,    Ben.

If it is a new bike take it back to the shop, if you bought it used you may need to also take it in. That is not a good sign.

k6u1Kka0aa	Levels of modification. Stage 1 is usually a reflashed computer. Stage 2 adds on to that with a turbo-back exhaust. See links below.|`|ZBVMT11maa	Stages are marketing terms. Depending on which vendor you go they have diff definitions of stages. I've seen a wide variety of stages out there, but the 3 most widely used ones would probably be Cobb, TurboXS, and the XPT staged mapsTypically though...    Stage 1: tune  Stage 2: exhaust + tune (keeps stock turbo...you can bolt on all the crap you'd like to it though, so it varies a lot).    After stage 2 it gets fuzzy. Cobb's stage 2.5 is basically the addition of an IHI turbo or the like and supporting mods, where as cobb's stage 2.5 would be TurboXS's stage 4. TurboXS's stage 3, however, is just the addition of a bigger TMIC.    Stage 3: TXS says stage 3 includes an upgraded intercooler but still stock turbo. Cobb was going with stage 3 as in turbo swap. These are the only ref to stage 3 ive ever heard of.  Stage 4: Most ppl skip right to this once the turbo is swapped        to sum up :   Stage 1= engine management  Stage 2= Engine management + turboback exh  Stage 3= Engine management + turboback exh + up pipe + Upgraded TMIC  Stage 4= Engine management + turboback exh + Up pipe + Larger turbo + injectors + fuel pump|`|939307a82ae025e53a21c0a641378b87aa	Using the term "Stages" is tool talk.

Just depends on how strong you want it to be.|`|sCqdisvnaa	Personally, I like the looks of the stock headunit.  Most aftermarket HU's just look out of place in a BMW dashboard.    The best stock BMW headunits for your car are the C43 radio-cassette and the CD43 radio-CD.  Both have better sound than what you have right now, and are plug-and-play (except they won't run the 1995 and earlier factory CD changer, if you have it).    My preference is for a stereo that sounds good, but isn't obvious that it's an aftermarket installation, so on that basis I'd be looking for a set of (used) JL Audio Stealthboxes for the rear deck and some MB Quart components for the front footwell midrange/woofer and the door tweeters.  Hook it up to amp(s) of your choice.      Also consider Bavarian Soundwerks (BSW) for better speakers that fit in the stock locations.    A lower-cost solution would be to find factory Harman-Kardon bits for sale used, and put them in place of your stock stuff.  They sound a little better.
5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	Sometimes.    If the flukes get stuck under a ledge or something they try to dislodge it by maneuvering this way and that, but sometimes it cannot be done.     I was on a natural gas tanker once where the captain had a major attitude problem.    The whole crew were being replaced, yet he thought if he was a total @ $$ to everyone and kept expenses down to nothing he would be able to keep his job.   Someone went up to the bow at night off the Philippines and dropped the anchor while we were moving along at 20 knots.    I was on the bridge luckily and felt the ship shaking, then saw a cloud of dust (smoke?) and sparks flying everywhere.    We woke the chief mate up to check to make sure there wasn't any fire up by the manifolds - 700 feet in front of us and behind a few tanks.    He reported back that there was no fire, but there was no anchor either.    It, along with 1800 feet of chain was heading 20,000 feet straight down.     It cost the company 5 million just to get a barge out that could lift our spare anchor off deck to attach to the new chain (100 pounds per foot) and attach it back to the ship.   Capt. lost his job 3 weeks earlier than the rest of us did.|`|I7NkFJo2aa	With the cost of ships anchors in the thousands it is not usual to abandon unless the ships safety is at stake.

I wouldn't imagine that it would happen too often, but if it did, most boats have one anchor on either side, so they would just leave the one that is stuck behind.|`|v905m6jRaa	If you think about the design of an anchor, you'll see that they are designed to hold a ship from horizontal movement.  Anchors resist being dragged, not being lifted.    Most anchors, in fact, incorporate a long bar which acts like a lever to help pry the anchor free when it is lifted from directly above.    If the anchor is totally fouled and can't be raised a light line (rope or cable) will be attached to the chain with a marker buoy.  Salvage companies, with barges, divers, heavy cranes, etc. will then have to raise the anchor.

If it isn't the computer, the throttle body could be jamming or the master break cylinder could have a fault.|`|gGBPPjLeaa	It is possible tha the above are correct the throttle cable is stuck and that is easy enough to fix (usuaully) however it could also be the throttle position sensor is way out of whack, more than likely though it is the cable being stuck.
oyvRHQmaaa	A lot.. you would need to rebuild the inside of the doors, and run all the wiring...... probably 3000.00.. cheaper to get a different car....|`|GrgNm1Ofaa	The dealer would charge through the nose, you can order the parts and do it yourself for a few hundred - maybe 500$, just a guess.    But if you don't have power windows and locks, you won't have them break either. hmm....|`|s3L88qGQaa	You Should Ask Your Chevrolet  Dealer Or Call Them. Thank You!|`|5IvxBEr9aa	WAY more than it's even worth  Just think of it this way. No power windows=Weight Reduction :)

71133c5b27fbdaa8629cfbb5dafa77afaa	200 watt alternator, 0 gague wiring to the amp between alt and battery ground from amp to body along with grounds to batt and from engien to body, optima yellow top battery atleast 1 if not 2.|`|zDeFibxzaa	extra battery,heavy gauge wires and i mean bigger than what is going to your starter,and capacitors,high output alt will help too 105 to 140 amp,size two gauge wire,six will work but two is great,you want big,you got to think big!|`|AA12046543	Youll need a little more than what he said, get the following..only if you wanna do it right!    300amp alternator (or biggest available you can find)  Voltage regulator for alternator (trust me, i speak from experience!)  The "Big 3"  (wire the electrical system from battery to ground, battery to                       alternator, and alternator to ground with 0gauge wire)  2 Kinetick 2400's batteries or equivalent(capacitors are a waste of money...and add these onto another good battery in the front)  Run quality speaker wire, because higher end will carry a lot more current than cheap crap (monster flex tube is the best i think)  A strong ground.    If you do this, you should be able to keep up 5000watts properly with minimal voltage drop.  Good luck!|`|Tc2I7znMaa	Wow um...a lot of money i guess...I can't really tell you exactly what you need without anything other than the final output. Anyways here is a rough estimate.    A couple of High output 200amp alternators  More than a few deep-cycle batteries, probably Optima yellow tops or similar.  At least 1/0 gauge wiring but not knowing the type of car, where everything is positioned etc. I can't tell you how much.  The "Big 3 Upgrade" with the aforementioned wire.  Distribution Blocks, large fuses, heavy duty terminal connectors.  With the capacitor most people go for 1 farad for every 1000wrms of power so dependent on the system setup that can be split up in different ways.  New suspension.    I'm thinking upwards of $10k (AUD) without buying any actual amplifiers/subs etc.    Good luck,    Ben.
P2CaBLM9aa	that was a $4,000 mistake jack ***|`|fscgp7iFaa	ummm yeah without oil your engine can blow & you'll have to get it replaced.|`|1e85b081f9cb68b21b9d1357e658f9ccaa	Oil is the life blood of any motor wear occurs very fast when moving metal parts are unprotected by a film of oil. Why would any one drive knowing they were low or out of oil? Neglect the paint neglect the carpets and interior but never the oil. Unless you like to spend $5,000 for a replacement motor.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Mary, you may have done internal motor damage.  Yes, you should be worried.  I would have your vehicle checked in a certified shop.|`|ElBIeRFNaa	my grandpa did this to his mini van, and blew the engine, which cost MUCH more than getting a simple oil change.  please get this taken care of before it costs you TONS of money.|`|NZvYP7Q2aa	This is the most ridiculous question I have ever heard!  A person that would drive a car knowing it didn't have oil is not even smart enough to be driving in the first place.  IDIOT!|`|9HpfwnBaaa	I am suprised that it is still running.  No oil for a week, usualy kills the motor.|`|GBMf0UiZaa	Yes your engine is toast and if you let it go any longer the rod bearing will spin and it will be 10 times worse it you throw the rod off the crank   And being a nissan wizzard they dont like to knock for very long|`|FT7W3f6yaa	Don't worry.  I once walk around butt naked and most people don't remember. But I had my face masked but how about you when you were driving without the oil?|`|Q5tR52Oxaa	ADD oil and run the engine if the knock stays there you have mechanical problems if the knock goes away after it circulates then you may be ok no major damage   but you are stressing the bottom end running with out oil
k0cGzui9aa	There is obviously very little water in the engine. Try filling the radiator with HOT water while running the engine.Once the system is full you need to pressure test it.  There could be worse issues now that the engine has been run so hot.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Leaking Waterpump.  Cracked hoses.  Blown Head gasket.  All possibilities.|`|AA12169920	Often when a engine overheats it will blow a head gasket, or worse, crack the cylinder head or engine block.    Replace the radiator, and have a shop do a compression test.|`|d9426d337e1d8a5019525d7f0bc82fc6aa	Repair / Replace the steam release valve on the black box.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	Typical fault with GM V6 engines regarding antifreeze leaks is the lower intake manifold gasket. Priced to repair somewhere around 600 or so depending where you live.
5de8ae1b663a9b3b8e2564d52425aec1aa	The first year of the unlimited was 2004, which is an entirely different jeep than the ones being produced now- its simply an extended wheels base and body tub Jeep Wrangler as opposed to the current models 4 vs. 2 doors.  The handles that are on current Wranglers started in 2007.
5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	Check the dome light fuse. That is probably where your stereo gets it's constant 12 volt memory from since you say the interior lights quit working also.
5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	If the Stratus is the 2 door model it will be the same mounting and same wiring connector. If it is a 4 door the mounts will still be the same but the connector and antenna jack will be different. You could still use it but would have to buy an antenna adapter and two harnesses to make an adapter plug. One side to plug into the Sebring harness and one side to plug into the Stratus radio.|`|AA12046543	Well, theres a good chance it might, and theres a chance it wont.  Try this.     have him take 2 pictures.  one, of the fron of the radio, so you can see on the sides the screw hole configuration and see if they line up inside your car.  also, have him take one close-up of the socket in the back of the radio.  Look at your wiring harness inside your vehicle, and compare the two.  count number of pins and location.  if they match, it should fit!
