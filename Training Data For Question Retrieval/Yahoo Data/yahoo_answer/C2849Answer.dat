Pc0QjrQ4aa	Social norms didn't change.<br>  <br>  People have just decided to come up with a bogus excuse to not tip.<br>  <br>  If I cannot afford to eat out and tip 15-20%, then I stay home or order takeaway.  Simple as that.  Am I eating out fewer times?  Yes; maybe 4-5 times a month instead of 6-7.  When I eat out, I'm still tipping the same, and I still expect (and pay for) good service.<br>  <br>  If you're reading this...verbal tips don't count, so don't thank your server or compliment the manager, and then think it's okay to undertip (it's not).|`|ljFBfguRaa	I'm a server and I have definately noticed that people are tipping less. I haven't been aware that they are ordering cheaper food, usually they continue in their eating and drinking habits and stiff on the tip. If people are really worried about a few extra dollars, then have one less beer, get a cheaper entree, or go out to eat less. Skipping on the tip isn't fair to the people working to serve you!|`|AA10804824	I am sorry to hear that. I work at a privately owned steakhouse, and average $84 a day (for a lunch shift) for the past 2 years. Less customers, but less servers on the floor, too. I just figured out Februarys average, and it was normal. <br>  I am sorry customers are taking it out on you. Like the economy isn't affecting you and your bills.|`|G5B2Dx2Zaa	I always tip 15%, no matter where.  If the service is good, I'll add a few more dollars.  If my budget is tight, I'll order a less expensive item but I'll still tip at least 15%.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	No it hasn't affected the way I tip. When I go out to eat I always take plenty of extra money to ensure I can give a proper tip if I received excellent service. As a server, I notice that some people will really take advantage of special deals we may have going on (buy one entree get one free, $4 appetizers, coupons, etc.) and will tip cheaply even when receiving lots of food for little money and great service. On the other hand I will receive some really awesome tips. It all depends.|`|zob4spgGaa	We haven't changed our habits much. We generally go to the same restaurant where the portions are very generous and prices are very reasonable. We always tip at least 15%. My wife and I have not seen our income drop at all so we're trying to do our part in helping share it.|`|mbpvOXrGaa	I tip the same but I don't eat out as often to save money overall.  Also, I see what's inexpensive and if I'm in the mood for it.  I use to go out to eat 3 or 4 times a month but now only go once or twice.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	I can't afford to go out to eat anymore, but if I could, I would only go if I could still tip the 15-20%.|`|AA10842045	Nope, it hasn't effected my tipping habits at all. If I can't afford a tip I go to a place that does not take them, or stay home and cook.|`|X2JnYSV5aa	No, my tipping habits are the same. I still tip 15-20%|`|k8HpMaHxaa	I dont eat out often, because as a server I'm usually eating 'take out' 4-5 days a week...but I definitely agree with you about the tips. Its not so much that people are ordering less and tipping less. It seems they are ordering the same, and only tipping less. In all honestly, business has slowed down dramatically, which means each waitress is getting half the amount of usual costumers. With so few tables, service has actually been better, but tips are still going down.<br>  <br>  I'm hoping when the 'city people' come back up for summer vacation that business as well as tips will go up. Hopefully..|`|gaXUIduMaa	I am tipping the same percentage but I am ordering the smaller entree.  Cutting down on tips doesn't get you as much as getting a cheaper meal.  Now I do admit that I do base the tip on the quality of service but I think most of the people who have served me is not disappointed with what I leave them.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I always tip the same, 15-20% based on service.  Usually I just figure out what 15 would be, what 20 would be, and leave the closest whole dollar amount in the middle.  If the service is really good, obviously I'll try to tip more, if not, then I really don't care since they don't really deserve much if they give me bad service.
