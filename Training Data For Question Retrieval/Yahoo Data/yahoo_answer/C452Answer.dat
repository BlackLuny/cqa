Ufi16bJZaa	Usually to transplant an aloe you have to wait til it has pups - a.k.a. new growth.  You remove the new grouwth and transplant it.  To transplant a plant without pups, you have to take it out of the ground/dirt and split the roots into how many new plants you want.  I use a regular kitchen knife to ciut them and replant them.

I don't have much experience of thermostats being present in many of the houses I have been in.<br>  In my current house that's because I have a condensing combi boiler (no hot water tank in loft) so it heats up the water we require on demand.  It was only installed about 2 years ago and the thermostat is an optional extra if we wanted it.<br>  There is a control on the front of the boiler to adjust the temperature of the heating so there's no real need for a thermostat.<br>  The room stat will only control the room temperature in which it is installed. That may be the living room or sometimes the hallway. The other rooms should be controlled by individual TRV's (thermostatic radiator valves), these can be adjusted by you easily, If you don't have them I would suggest you enquire about them from your local plumber, they will save you heating up rooms unnecessarily.<br>  In rented accommodation, the boiler needs to be certified as working and efficient by a corgi registered engineer but there isn't a legal requirement to have a thermostat.

It would not be a bad thing to talk to the landlord and ask about controlling the temperature.  You should be told what is the method of setting and maintaining the proper temperature.  If you are too hot or too cold then it is more urgent, if you are always comfortable, then just for curiousity sake I would want to know.|`|Q4PCupuqaa	Do you mean house or apartment?

755b902c87985d7c33c6d8871c72f6e5aa	Last spring we had big, black ants that formed a slow-motion parade across my bedroom wall, going into the bathroom.  We got, maybe, 2-4 new ants per day, but I never saw any leaving, which grossed me out the more I thought about it.  My husband put down traps, which did not work.  Plus, there was no food anywhere in the bedroom or bathroom.  One day I saw some ants SWIMMING IN THE BOTTOM OF THE DISHWASHER.  That totally , utterly grossed me out, so I called an exterminator.  He said the big black ants only eat damp wood.  It turned out we had an ice dam that led to a leak in the basement that resulted in damp wood.  The exterminator sprayed his poison one time and that was all it took.  I half expected to find a big nest of dead ants, but we never found anything like that.<br>  <br>  My son was 3 months old at the time.  The exterminator sprayed in all of the cracks of the kitchen, including on the counter and the floor and in the bathroom and outside.  My son didn't get sick or anything, and it was a year ago.|`|aGORltJPaa	How to Get Rid of Ants:<br>  ?<br>  Few pests are harder to get rid of than ants once they've established themselves in your home. If you're tired of stumbling upon a swarm of ants on a regular basis, you'll need to make a concentrated effort to keep these uninvited guests away.<br>  <br>  Steps:<br>  Shut down the ant buffet. The reason ants are coming into your <br>  humble abode is because it's a free-for-all (or at least it was at some <br>  point in the past, and they're hoping it might be again). The cleaner<br>  you keep the house, the less they'll have to eat, and the more they'll<br>  look elsewhere for goodies.<br>  <br>  Wipe down all surfaces. Tables and counter tops should be regularly sprayed and cleaned with a mild bleach or vinegar solution. Sweep, mop and vacuum regularly. <br>  Put food in air-tight containers. This has the added bonus of keeping the food fresher. <br>  Keep the sink clean: no dirty dishes, no standing water for ants to drink, no food in the drain. <br>  Put pet food bowls in a slightly larger bowl and add some water to the larger bowl, creating a moat around the pet food that the ants can't cross (too bad you can't put one of those around your house!). <br>  <br>  ?A lone ant brings home the bacon--or in this case, the cat foodSquish the scouts. Colonies regularly send out lone ants to check for food sources. If you see an individual ant strolling across your coffee table, don't let it make it back to the nest alive. It'll tell the colony where you spilled the apple juice. If the scout made it back to the nest and brought back some friends, they'll be following a scent trail, single file. Unless you're ready to bait them as described below, kill them all. Quickly.<br>  <br>  Spray the trail with all purpose cleaner or a bleach solution, then wipe it up with a wet paper towel. Only do this if you can get them all, however, because spraying like a mad man might encourage them to split up, go home, and establish new colonies.<br>  For a less hands-on solution, vacuum them all up, then vacuum some talcum powder or diatomaceous earth to finish them off. <br>  Barricade your home. Since ants are tiny, they can find thousands of tiny doorways into your residence. Some of them of are easy to identify; others will only be discovered when there's a parade of ants of marching through them.<br>  <br>  ?<br>  ?Seal windows, doors, and any cracks the ants crawl through with caulk. An additional benefit with this is better temperature control and lower energy bills. Plus, it's the least risky method when kids or pets are involved. <br>  Line suspected entryways with deterrent substances.<br>  <br>  Diatomaceous earth is a fine powder that kills ants by pulling all the moisture from their bodies. Since it's so absorbent, however, it's only effective in dry environments.You also don't want anyone in the house (pets included) sniffing it up. <br>  Salt works just fine as well, and you can spread it under doors, near windows and walls with better conscience. <br>  <br>  ?Talc in various forms is presumed to deter ants, although the mechanism is poorly understood.[3] Tailor's chalk and baby powder usually contain talc and can be used to create a barrier for ants. Regardless of which form of talc you use, keep in mind that there are concerns about the potential carcinogenicity of talc,[4] although baby powder is used by many parents nonetheless.<br>  <br>  *Many sources recommend using normal chalk, but this is made of gypsum, not talc, and could be the result of confusion with "ant chalk" (an insecticide that looks just like normal chalk; outlawed in the US in the '90s, but still sold in Chinatowns illegally).<br>  <br>  *Some baby powder brands are made of corn starch and will not work effectively against ants. Check the ingredients. <br>  <br>  ?Cornmeal can be used as a weapon against ants, and it's not poisonous to people or animals. Ants eat it and after consuming water, the cornmeal swells inside their digestive organs, causing them to die.<br>  <br>  ?Dried clovesYou can also apply scents and substances that ants simply don't like for various reasons: vinegar, peppermint oil, cinnamon, black pepper, cayenne pepper, whole cloves, and bay leaves. Some of these might be harmful to pets and irritating to curious children. <br>  <br>  ?Excavated ants' nestBring down the nest. If ants continue to raid your home, you're going to have to raid theirs--except that you're too big to get inside. If you're able to locate the nest, however, you can pour several gallons of boiling water into it and that'll be that. But if you don't know where they're coming from, your only alternative is to bait them.<br>  <br>  <br>  ?Commercial bait product at workPick your poison. Mixing boric acid powder or borax with maple syrup is the most common bait (that is what a popular commercial ant poison, Terro, basically consists of). Boric acid affects ants both externally (when in powder form; similar to diatomaceous earth) and internally (when ingested).  The ants bring the poison (borax or boric acid) with them to the colony and spread it around. If you get the quantity and t

I use Tea Tree Oil to clean them.  Put a few drops of Tea tree oil on a wet rag and scrub.  If it is embedded, get a small spray bottle.  You can do one of two things.<br>  <br>  One approach is to put in full strength white distilled Vinegar.  Spray the effected areas and let it set.  Then go back spray again ans wipe it off.

TMB4d3FAaa	I use a regular fluorescent shop light for both heating the seed to promote  germination and later to supply light for photosynthesis. Set the mini green house on the top side of the shop light cover. The top can easily attain temperatures up to around 90F. You may have to elevate it a little higher off the top for exact temperature you desire. Once the seedlings emerge and you have your cotyledon leaves even before the true leaves emerge, move the mini-greenhouse to the light side of the unit.  Place the as closely as possible to the light. You will not only receive the maximum amount of light, but also some of the heat from the bulbs.  Everyone knows the importance of light for photosynthesis however, not everyone realizes how critical the temperature is to healthy growth for the plants.  Peppers like it at least 75 degrees to perform at their best during the daylight/lighted hours.<br>  In the artificial light you may need up to 16 hours of exposure|`|wKQbNvm9aa	The heating pad will do much more to keep the soil warm for sprouting.

I give it a 9 out of 10 because there's really nothing to complain about.<br>  <br>  However, when you buy it make sure you get the right stuff. I sent my wife out with a friend to pick it up and they came home with black sides and a white headboard/footboard.  IKEA doesn't have the best customer service and no one there offered them any help in the extremely dark and vast warehouse portion of the store. <br>  I went back and returned the headboards and bought the correct ones (which was hard to tell because the color wasn't clearly written on the box. We wanted all black). I got home and started assembling it only to find I needed the slats and the center support brace. Granted they're cheap, it's a hassle when you don't know what is and isn't included in the boxes. That, plus IKEA is 45 minutes away for me. <br>  <br>  Once we had it all worked out, it's great though. We bought some 4" bed risers from Bed Bath and Beyond because we wanted to store things under our bed and that has worked out great also. So as long as you know what you need and get it all in one trip, you should be ok! <br>  <br>  We got our bed in early November and we love it.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	I have three different Ikea beds in my house..two are double one is queen..we all like our beds..they are about a year old..I would purchase another one from them. Give them a 9 rating.|`|GCicPp7daa	We have a full size MALM bed (with other items from that line) in our son's room.  This is the 2nd Ikea bed we have purchased, and I rate them very high (about a 9) on value.  Their beds are lower to the ground than a typical bed frame, so if you have any joint/mobility problems, you might want to keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  Since you are keeping your mattress, I won't discuss those, but do be certain to get the right kind of slats to go in the bed itself.  (These are usually purchased separately from their beds).<br>  <br>  The only real negative for their beds is that once they are assembled, they do not re-assemble very well - you can probably move them with you successfully 1 time but not 2.|`|l1UwQRBTaa	I love my ikea bed, its a large double bed, I've had it for a year, and its really comfortable, i would recommend their mattresses too, they are ultimately comfortable and you can pick the best on for you.<br>  <br>  Also they have a MASSSIVE long guarantee on them!<br>  <br>  Plus they do nice bed covers there too!|`|WUUXLvdnaa	i dont like anything from ikea. i find their designs to be very boring, and plain. i much rather prefer to buy something with a little more style. i would give my bed a 4 because i have high standards. mine is a full size (double) bed. ive only had it a few weeks but it is used, not new.

N4IvZmPiaa	100,000 btu's burns roughly 1 gallon in one hour. Take a look at the rating plate of your furnace, which is usually inside the front cover near the gas valve somewhere. It will say something like "80,000 btu input at 11 wc". Most water heaters are about 35,000 btu.<br>  <br>   If you time how many minutes in an hour your furnace runs you should be able to figure out your consumption.<br>  <br>  On a 1900 square foot home, you probably have an 80,000 btu furnace or so. Could be 90k...could be 70k... You don't mention how many people live in the home. That can make a difference for water heating especially.<br>  <br>   But, just for example...let's take a 35k btu water heater running 10 minutes out of every hour, which is probably pretty conservative, unless you live alone. That's going to burn roughly 1-1/2 gallons a day. So there is 45 gallons per month right there.<br>  <br>   The 80k btu furnace running say 10 minutes out of every hour, which I think is probably much lower than it actually runs, is going to burn 100 gallons a month!<br>  <br>  You've also got a cooking range there, that you said you haven't been using, but it can easily use use 10 gallons a month by itself. Do you have a gas clothes dryer? They burn a fair bit too...<br>  <br>  I don't think your consumption sounds that bad! Actually, I think you are doing reasonably well!<br>  <br>   If you would like to let me know the btu's of your appliances and time how often they run in a given hour, I can do a load consumption calculation for you pretty quickly.<br>  <br>   If you do suspect a leak, I would have the supply company come out and check it for you.  Good luck with it!|`|fNuMoHt7aa	Is this your first winter in your house? <br>  <br>  Check for leaks. with a soapy spray wet every fitting and check for bubbles.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think propane guy inhaled to much propane. at $3.00 a gallon he thinks  $135 a month is "conservative" just to run a hot water heater... crazy|`|YuXklGUlaa	your propane usage is mainly determined by"degree days",here in wisconsin  they are published in major news papers,,,,google degree days for an explanation,u have to compare degree days by the month to accurately  track your gas consumption,,u can possibly get the number of degree days from your propane co.,,in a nut shell the more degree days u have the more propane u will use

AA10232434	find them a job ... Ha!|`|aGORltJPaa	How to Get Rid of Hobo Spiders<br>  <br>  Hobo spiders are found in the in the north-western states as well as south-western Canada. They were also recently found as far north as southern Alaska. <br>  The hobo spider can also be found in Europe, where it originated. Hobos are commonly called black recluse spiders; however, they are not recluses at all. <br>  These types of spiders are venomous to humans even though they only poison 50 percent of the time. <br>  Nevertheless, if you do receive poison from these creatures, a hole can form in your skin. This can also be extremely painful. It is important, if you live in an area that is known for hobo spiders, to protect yourself and a family from these creatures. <br>  In a few simple steps, you will learn the methods in which you can rid yourself of these unwanted hobo spiders.<br>  <br>  Instructions:<br>  <br>  Things You’ll Need:<br>  Cat <br>  Hobo Spider Traps <br>  <br>  Step1:  Visit the human society. <br>  Pick up a field mouse cat. They are excellent hunters and trackers. <br>  The hobo spider's poison does not affect cats in any way. The cat will find the hobos in your home or garage and kill them quickly. <br>  <br>  Step2:  Remove the insects in and around your home. <br>  If you do not wish to kill crickets or other insects that the hobos feed on, a company in your local area may come out and remove them. <br>  However, this may take a lot of time and money. <br>  <br>  Step3:  Remove cobwebs and kill the hobos as soon as they are spotted. <br>  They move fairly slowly and are sort of big so they can be easily seen. <br>  <br>  Step4:  Purchase hobo traps. <br>  There are several insect traps available. However, the most affective are actual hobo and black recluse traps. <br>  They are sticky and scented with a smell that attracts the hobos.<br>   <br>  Step5:  Locate hobo traps. Various stores in your local area can equip you with the traps you need. HoboSpider.com can assist you in finding stores in your hometown. You can also buy these traps from on-line retailers. T&J Enterprises (800) 998-8692 offers single and bulk hobo traps. B&T Grower Supply, Inc. (800) 748-6487 offers a pack of 25 traps at minimal cost. <br>  <br>  Step6:  Place the hobo traps. <br>  Make note of where the spiders are seen the most. Place the traps in these pathways, as well as under windows, near entry ways, in corners and less traveled areas. Those areas are usually garages, basements or attics.

AA11725139	If you have a lot of them, you could run them through your washing machine on "warm" water and "gentle" cycle, but use no more than a tablespoon of anti-bacterial dish soap (such as "Dawn") rather than laundry detergent.  A short cycle should do it.  If you plan to split them up the sides and cut them into strips, you can open them flat before you wash them.  Then it's a matter of hanging them to dry (I've used hangers on my shower rod) before further prep for use.  If you plan to cut one long, continuous spiral (on the bias) out of each bag, turn them inside out, making sure all sides are immersed in soapy water, before washing them.<br>  <br>  I have knitted and crocheted with plastic bags.

rfK4ftpJaa	Don't feel bad I've done the same thing except a little differently.  I washed my dishes with dishsoap and didn't do so good a job at rinsing them.  <br>  <br>  Anyways here's what I did based on a dishwasher repairman's advice, put a little bit of cooking oil (a little like 1/4 cup or less, just enough to fill one detergent cup in your machine) in your dishwasher to cut the bubbles down and run another cycle.  You can also add milk and run another cycle.  You may have to run a few cycles of the oil or milk to get rid of all the bubbles.  But, the oil or milk does do the trick at cutting the bubbles.  Oh & be sure to use the highest temperature water cycles that your machine will allow.  This will not only cut the bubbles, but will get rid of the cooking oil too.  <br>  <br>  I thought these would ruin my machine, but think about it, it washes greasy dishes and glasses with milk in them all the time.  So, just a little bit of these won't hurt since your machine handles them all the time.<br>  <br>  Before you do this, scrap out as much bubbles as you can and get rid of them... throw them outside (don't let the neighbors see)...anything to get rid of them.  I know this sounds funny, but it will help to get rid of the bubble mess.  Just toss and mop up the overflowing bubbles on your floor too.  Wipe the machine down too.  <br>  <br>  This is a big mess I know, but you'll have to run a few cycles in your dishwasher until you don't see anymore bubbles.  <br>  <br>  I now use a dishwasher cleaner by Glisten every month or so to clean out the dishwasher which you may want to do when you're done.  <br>  <br>  On the bright side, everything will be clean including the floor when you're all done.  You can even take some of the bubbles and put on a few paper towels or soft rag and wipe down and polish the stove hood.  Plain dish soap works great at cutting grease and the bubbles from the dish soap will work well too at cutting grease.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and don't stress.  You'll be able to laugh about this one day!<br>   <br>  For more great cleaning tips, check out <a href="http://www.lifeorganizeit.com/house-cleaning-tips.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifeorganizeit.com/house-clea...</a>|`|cpmiJQyIaa	Well, you could waite for a few hours and the suds will dissipate on their own and then clean up the residue that's left.  Another thing you can do is grab a lot of wet rags and start slowly breaking the bubbles with gentle pressure and wipe up whats left.  Don't smack at the suds.  they'll just fly everywhere and make it worse.<br>  <br>  Next time, if you run out of dishwasher detergent you can use White distilled vinegar or washing soda in its place.|`|J6Ksn0P7aa	I must admit, I am laughing right now.

The swiffers saved my sanity when I thought keeping my hardwoods free of pet hair was going to make me insane.<br>  <br>  The routine that works for me only takes about 20 minutes every morning and about 10 at night, with one weekend day for a good 1 hour deep clean.<br>  <br>  Morning<br>  5 mins: Do a light dusting/windexing of any table surfaces you have since pet hair gets everywhere.  <br>  5 mins: Run the swiffer vacuum all around the house.  <br>  5 mins: Vacuum any rugs you might have or Wet Jet the floors.  Alternate each every other day or so to save time<br>  5 mins: Unload the dishwaher, or put away dry dishes if you don't have one<br>  3 mins: throw a load of clothes in the washer<br>  <br>  Evening<br>  <br>  5 mins: Do the dishes before bed and wipe down counters<br>  3 mins:  Before bed (I do it after I brush my teeth)  grab some lysol wipes and a dry towel wipe off your bathroom surfaces and dry as you go, then you wake up to a clean bathroom.<br>  5 mins: fold the laundry and put away<br>  <br>  Weekend<br>  <br>  dust all of your furniture,  scrub the tub/shower, scrub the toilet, clean the  bathroom floors, windex all of your mirrors and windows (as needed I have to do mine because i have baby fingerprints and cat noses on them) vacuum furniture and spray with febreeze anti allergen to cut down on pet hair, it may seem nuts but I rub my sofas and chairs with bounce because I swear it helps keep the pet hair from sticking so bad,<br>  Your deep clean day should only take about an hour tops now because you cleaned all week. :)<br>  <br>   Cranking up some good music and having my coffee while I clean makes it less painful for me.  Hope my routine helps you  figure out what works for you:)|`|rfK4ftpJaa	If you really hate to clean, then I would work hard on the traffic areas.  See <a href="http://www.lifeorganizeit.com/home-cleaning-tips.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifeorganizeit.com/home-clean...</a> for more info on how to deal with the high traffic areas.  Stopping the dirt before it enters your home is more than half the battle.    <br>  <br>  Having all hard floors is a good thing especially with the dogs.  With  hard floors you can see the dirt and dust bunnies and deal with these right away with a Swiffer Sweeper and these are relatively cheap, easy to use, and work great.<br>  <br>  Okay, for a routine well that would be up to you.  I clean as needed and vary between using a day to clean to cleaning when I have the time, so it's really up to you.  I do think that if you clean as needed, you won't have to work so hard on the day you dedicate to cleaning.  Cleaning as needed could work as follows on the bathroom, spray the shower with Clorox Clean up before you get in then scrub and rinse it off and shower as usual.  While you brush your teeth, grab a sanitary wipe and wipe down the counters, sink, and fixtures.  After using the restroom, wipe the toilet down from top to bottom with a sanitary wipe.<br>  <br>  I think it's more important to clean from top to bottom than worrying about a specific routine.  For instance, when you dust, work from the top down and clean the floor last that way you'll be picking up all the dirt and dust that has fallen.  So, worry about cleaning as needed, maybe set 15 minutes aside a night, or every other night to clean.  And, clean things that get a lot of frequent use like the kitchen and bathrooms more often.  <br>  <br>  I clean up my kitchen every night after making dinner and it takes less than 5 minutes, maybe 10 if I mop and I mop as needed.  The whole kitchen involves wiping things (cabinets if needed, counters, stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, etc.) from the top down with sanitary wipes like those Clorox makes, scouring the sink with Comet, vacuum, and mop if needed.  I also use liquid dishwashing detergent to cut grease on the stove top and hood.  Just squirt some on paper towels and work in and buff to a shine.  The soap just works wonders to cut through the grease.<br>  <br>  I know my answer is all over the place, but you need to find a routine that works for you and if you don't like to clean, spending a whole day doing it is a drag.  So, I'd break it up during the week and set a timer and race to get it done. <br>  <br>  Check out the site below for more great house cleaning tips.  There's even a page for house cleaning you can ignore!|`|AA10097817	It's all about routines. And working with routines that fit your life.

2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	Powders leave crud on the clothes.  The liquids leave my clothes clean.  I used the major brands for years, most recently Tide, but lately to reduce cost I've been shopping sales and less costly brands.  My clothes don't get that dirty so no use over washing them.  The cheaper brands are fine for me if I pretreat stains.  I like a little fragrance, but one way to reduce cost is to reduce fragrance.  I can live with that.  <br>  <br>  I don't use fabric softeners, just more chemicals and money I don't need to waste.|`|cpmiJQyIaa	I use Charlie's Soap laundry detergent.  (Currently using the powder, but have ordered some liquid.)  I like the fact it is hypoallergenic.  It is certified safe for use in rivers and streams and can be used in any type washer, which means I can use it anywhere.  It leaves behind no residue.  I do not have to use fabric softener anymore.  If I buy it in bulk, it is way less expensive than anything I can buy at the store.  It cleans fantastic.  Plus, the company that makes and sells Charlie's is super nice and very customer oriented.  Most importantly, it cleans fantastic.  I use to use Tide, but I think the Charlie's is way better.|`|KjQaxGX0aa	Hello  Did you know that most brands whether they be cheap, expensive or generic are all made by the same people.  The only difference is the quality of the ingredients.  You get what you pay for that is true. I myself prefer powder  and make sure it is dissolved properly before washing any clothes and the BIG SECRET TO WASHING SUCCESSFULLY IS DON'T OVERLOAD YOUR MACHINE. I tend to think that liquids can be over used it says a cap full but a lot people invariably put more in thinking that it is needed, I know I have done that myself.  Water can have a big effect on the performance of your powder/liquid as well.  Some water won't create suds easily this is known as hard water, some water creates too many suds meaning the water is soft.  Whether you wash in hot, warm or cold water this can effect the outcome to, unless the product is designed especially for cold water.  I wash in warm water with powder and a little disinfectant, then rinse in cold that is my preference<br>  and it has worked well for me.  Good quality surfactants are very important in any product as they are wetting agents that roughly speakly break the surface tension allowing easier spreading capacity.  So the cheaper the product the poorer the surfactants are that is why you get build up on clothes sometimes because it doesn't dissolved properly. Lastly alot of it is trial and error and how much you can afford.  The brands I prefer are Radiant, Biozet, Omo, Drive or Fab if I am on a budget.  Anyhoo happy washing hope this helped|`|Nicf5B8faa	I prefer Powder because you get more of your money I currently use Gain with Baking Soda - I do small of laundry <br>  <br>  I use all kinds of brands<br>  Foca <br>  Sun<br>  Some chiense brand of Tide found at my local 99 cent store<br>  Ariel<br>  Libro<br>  Eco Free & Clear - Powder - This one such big time as well - horrible on colors - It quickly fades the colors<br>  <br>  <br>  Liquid<br>  Small & Mighty<br>  Purex<br>  Arm & Hammer with Oxiclean<br>  Seventh Generation - Free & Clear - This one such big time|`|AA11177376	I use Era with bleach...I have 4 kids and about 4000 kinds of dirt...it works well on everything and leaves no residue or per-fumy smell|`|AA10097817	I like my liquid clothes washing detergent because it has no fragrance and no dyes.

dd060cdd8cbb95273e6536f82ae522e4aa	Find a reputable collectibles dealer specializing in souvenir spoons.  Ask for recommendations on the care of the spoons.  Don't use any harsh, chemical cleaners.  Also, check your local library for any books on souvenir spoons so you can get more information on the spoons.

0jmVA50Jaa	Put them in a good  warm soil.     For Grapefruit seeds, I would never put them in the freezer.    Hopefully the refrigerator did not delay their sprout. <br>   I have a wonderful Grapefruit tree and it is refered to as a Junior Citrus.  It is now 10 ft., high.   It has thorns on it that is so sharp and when you pick one leaf off and crumble up the leaf it has a wonderful smell of Grapefruit.    The leaves are a shinny green.    Very easy to grow.  Plant the seeds about 2 inches into good soil.    They should sprout and within two months ,more or less you will see green.   We live in a climate that is not good for Junior Citrus.   I should take my beautiful tree South and donate it , but I am selfish and love to keep it indoors.   Now when the hard winter is over and mid-Spring, I will take it outdoors and set it in the sun.   Outdoors you need to water at least twice a week.    It is beautiful.     No fruit yet, and I am hoping some day, I will see blossoms.    When you put your seeds into soil, place the potted seeds in a window with direct sunlight.    Good Luck and I hope you live in an area where the Citrus grow.  If not you need to take your plant in before the frost.    Good Luck.

For those of you who say complain write down times of noise an all that crap NAH it doesnt work because no one cares about anyone else anymore FIGHT FOR YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|2ba40000b05c80f1026052730a2733afaa	You live in an apartment complex that allows children.  Children make noise.....especially the smaller ones.  Do keep a log of time and duration of noise.  Day time noise will have to be tolerated, but sleep time noise must not.  After you have a log, talk to the parent..expect to get flogged.........people really don't care about other people's privacy anymore.  Then you can take it to manager and owner.  Otherwise, I hope you have a short lease and can leave soon.

iIeMgpBkaa	Yep, I guess they did.  You might try 2 wrenches; one to hold the neck that comes out of the wall ( wrap a towel or rag around it so you don't scar it ) and the other to loosen the shower head.  Spray some WD-40 or silicone lubricant on the threads of the neck where it goes into the shower head you want to replace. Don't be afraid to put some shoulder behind it.  If you have a third hand...or a friend, have them hold the wrench on the shower head while you give that wrench a sharp couple of raps with a hammer.  The worst that can happen is that the neck coming out of the wall will unscrew, also.  This may sound patronizing, but be sure that you're turning the head the right direction.  We have seen high end Euro heads that screw on counterclockwise and had fits before we realized that we had to thread the necks bassackwards.|`|q9075Yawaa	just one question.  are you turning the part the wrong way?|`|AA10097817	I would call the builder and ask them to have it removed. You're still under warranty, right?|`|AA11786642	Spray WD40 on the threads. Use a pipe wrench with a rag to protect the pipe coming out of the wall and grip it. Take another pipe wrench to grab the shower head. First try to tighten the shower head just a little more than it already is. Then loosen it a little. Work it back and forth turning it a little bit more each time you are backing it out. This worked for me.|`|tZXHSxkQaa	It may take two 12" pipe wrenches,use a couple towels/wash clothes,the towels will protect the pipe and shower-head.One wrench is to hold the pipe coming out of wall,the other on the back side of shower-head where the connect,the shower-head unscrews counter-clockwise(put wrench on from underneath away from you,so you can pull toward you).Good luck!|`|botH6rIQaa	try a  vicegrip,  the tool locks on,  so I can't imagine it wouldn't do the job.|`|c85WWXV7aa	More then likely what they used is Superdope.

09b5cda8fd3d54924b89c8bee2a0a291aa	In general, hardy bulbs, such as the Tulip's, produce Foliage & Bloom in spring. However, Low Temperatures Break Dormancy, therefore their growth may resume in fall and early winter. Tulip's that show signs of early growth will be just fine, by following these steps.<br>  <br>  Mulch over the bulbs to extend the root development period. The mulch also helps to reduce the Freeze/Thaw cycle, which is not good.  When the soil has frozen to a depth of 1" to 2", add more Mulch. <br>  <br>  Tulip's are bothered by rodents, particularly "Squirrels, Chipmunks, & Mice". They dig and feed on (or store) Tulip, Crocus, Chionodoxa, & Lily.  Daffodils & Hyacinths are not bothered.  If rodents are a problem, consider enclosing the Tulip's in boxes (by using 1/2" mesh), or lay a sheet of hardware cloth over the planted area, then add more soil. In spring, Rabbits feed on Tulip and Lily Foliage. Chicken-wire enclosures or some of the taste repellents work fairly well.|`|1203d31ab3bc3d0447a306d55a7bde5faa	Tulip bulbs are tough (as are most other flowering bulbs); unless it gets really cold (like low 20s or below), it's not likely to be a problem.  Just to be sure, you could put some mulch around the growth that you're seeing; a good source that's probably VERY easy to get right now is fallen leaves.  Cover the growth with plenty of leaves, and possibly cover that with plastic mulch.  This will help moderate the temperatures around your bulbs.  I live in Washington state, but used to live in Colorado where it dropped to -20 or lower a LOT, and this worked nicely for me.

If you can put hardtack or chicken wire up there, they will stop nesting there.  I also handle their nesting materials with bare hands while they are building.

AA10492776	The base needs to be #8 or #9 gravel (the same gravel used to build roadbeds). You need 6" of compacted gravel under a patio. Dig for the gravel base. Dig out past the intended edges of the by at least 6". You want 6" of gravel base past the edge of the installed pavers. This is called over-basing and is very important to the integrity of the patio edge.  Make sure the ground is level before you apply the gravel. Note: The patio should have a slight (1/4" per 1') incline to shed water, preferably away from your house. The ground should be flat and have the same incline as the intended patio surface. Compact the ground with a 6400 ft. lb. centrifugal force plate compactor. Add the gravel in multiple stages of 2-4" and compact each stage. Use 1" of torpedo sand (not mason's or play sand). Do not compact the sand. Level the sand and lay the pavers. Apply your snap edging with landscape spikes to contain the pavers. Drive the spikes through the over based gravel. Its really important that the spikes are in the over based area. Compact the pavers into the sand base. Sweep sand into the joints. Enjoy the new patio!|`|679d01caf9049afcb0b3c4a8de3d0e6baa	level the area .. frim it up  put down a layer of sand  stamp it down firm lay tile.  ground MUST be hard...lots of work ...|`|39fc110170216c6e52dd7a3f131e2a91aa	Excavate 9-10 inches below desired final grade. Lay down an underlayment, filter fabric, prior to the gravel. Use a #411 crushed limestone (or similiar gravel) as your base. Depending on how you compact it whether it be a hand tamper or a compactor, this will determine how often you need to tamp it. If you do it by hand you want to do it every 1-2 inches. With a plate tamper you can go 4-6 inches depending on the weight of it. Prior to compacting layer you want to gently mist the aggregate. This helps the fines lock in with the bigger pieces. That's it for prep but it is a lot of work.|`|R8emvVC9aa	The basic ground work required for a patio is as follows.  This is what i do anyway.  Dig down 8 inches and level off.  Fill in with 4 inches of hard core.  Compact using a whacker plate compactor.  Fill in with 3 inches of sand.  You are now ready to lay your slabs using a 4 to 1 mix. Depend ant on the size of slab to be used, place the mix in piles like the number four or five on on a dice.  Tap down using a rubber mallet to level.  Place slabs at least 5mm to 10mm apart.  Using another 4 to 1 mix, point in the gaps.  Good luck, enjoy your patio.

For example, the nitrogen in the coffee grounds is in the form of proteins- like any bean or seed.  I wouldn't know for sure, but I think the other major nutrients would stay behind in the solid stuff.<br>  <br>  What you really need to do is let that stuff compost.  The bacteria and fungus will reduce the nutrients to their most basic forms that the roots can absorb, and the organic humus that is left behind will improve literally any type of soil.  <br>  <br>  In the example of Nitrogen we used before, bacteria eat proteins that plants can't absorb, and excrete nitrate molecules plants can use.

Would you mind working outdoors in all weathers? How fit are you, and how do you maintain your fitness? Do you get on well with people? What books have you read about landscaping and garden maintenance? <br>  thinking about these questions, and others like them, will help you prepare for your interview, and give you some ideas what to talk about, and also where maybe you might do a bit of homework beforehand. Also study the job description to work out what they are looking for in a landscape operative. find out what further qualifications you will be able to get and enquire about day-release schemes as part of your apprenticeship to enable you to study for these. Showing you have thought about your long-term prospects will be important in an apprenticeship interview. Prepare an answer to the question 'Why do you want to leave school at 16? Don't you want to stay on at school and get more qualifications there?'

Actually, what you could do, is sand the desk down first (except for the edges) or even use a small wood cutter and set the pennies into the desk so when you place the glass finish on, it has protection for the glass edges (because it fits perfectly down in the top surface).|`|MEyDFf0Vaa	what i would do is after painting white or any other color id put on a coat of polyvarethane while its still wet put your pennies on and let it dry for 24 or more hrs. then over the top add at least 3 more coats let dry 24 hrs. between each coat . to sand between coats use very fine steelwool use a damp cloth to clean let dry and coat  good luck sounds good|`|RM4DqEAUaa	use prettyful pennies|`|EuD4pX0saa	same thing they use to put tiles or back splash. or try grout or a glue gun|`|MDWaPmXsaa	Wow, that should end up looking neat.

I wouldnt jump too quick to replace the ERC.|`|PhfwGUcjaa	I had a similar problem but it was on the cook top. Turn the burner on low and it would eventually get red hot. We chunked it because of the fire hazzard. Stoves are cheap nowdays.|`|WaqjyJNGaa	sounds like your thermostat is bad
GLItEpFSaa	Well the neat thing about a eucalyptus is that you can take cuttings from it and just stick these in the ground and soon you'll have another tree so you shouldnt get too worried about it, ,seeing as you can move it it's still young I guess.<br>   <br>  Yes ,just take a cutting or two(branch)and place in a suitable growing area and viola' you've got a new tree.|`|eEUipNFRaa	if you cut a little piece off of it, and the inside is green, then it's still alive. Just water it really good, but not too much.|`|AA11990107	only if there is any green left in it
