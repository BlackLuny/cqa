I was sleeping in my room ( but really a deep sleep )  and I heard what sounded like a bomb exploded outside my window. Lightning struck a outside light at the corner of our house followed the wire from the light under the ground digging a 2 foot trench straight to our shed where we had gas canisters for the riding lawn mower.  The door to the shed had a deadbolt on it which the blast of lightning blew open the doors and set the outside part of our door on fire.  The trench that was in our yard from the lightning spit mud and grass into our in ground pool which was like 15 feet away.  It fried my old t.v. and my cordless phone in my room.  In the living room it sent the phone jack from the kitchen to the other side of the living room.       I have to say that was my worst lightning storm I went through.

But for humans - does it mean differently to each person?... I want to see the different interpretations, perspectives. Does a person write music to entertain his self or others? Does that person express himself using his own perspective in his music to try to make sense of things? How about the listeners? What does it mean to you? Some songs make one feel better in a vague way, is it the rhythm or the meaning of the lyrics to me? Anything you want to add?

20090225035138AAv76VD	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	How Much Is That Bill!?	Hotel Bill       Next time you think your hotel bill is too high you    might want to consider this...       Husband and wife are traveling by car from Key West to    Boston.       After almost twenty-four hours on the road, They're    too tired to continue, and they decide to stop for a    rest.       They stop at a nice hotel and take a room, but they    only plan to sleep for four hours and then get back on    the road.       When they check out four hours later, the desk clerk    hands them a bill for $350.00.       The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is    so high.       He tells the clerk although it's a nice hotel, the    rooms certainly aren't worth $350.00!       When the clerk tells him $350.00 is the standard rate,    the man insists on speaking to the Manager.       The Manager appears, listens to the man, and then    explains that the hotel has an Olympic-sized pool and    a huge conference center that were available for the    husband and wife to use.       'But we didn't use them,' the man complains.       'Well, they are here, and you could have,' Explains    the Manager.       He goes on to explain they could have taken in one of    the shows for which the hotel is famous.       'The best entertainers from New York , Hollywood and    Las Vegas perform here,' the Manager says.       'But we didn't go to any of those shows,' complains    the man again.       'Well, we have them, and you could have,' the Manager    replies.       No matter what amenity the Manager mentions, the man    replies, 'But we didn't use it!'       The Manager is unmoved, and eventually the man gives    up and agrees to pay. He writes a check and gives it    to the Manager.       The Manager is surprised when he looks at the check.    'But sir,' he says, this check is only made out for    $50.00.'       'That's correct,' says the man. 'I charged you $300.00    for sleeping with my wife.'       'But I didn't!' exclaims the Manager.       'Well, too bad,' the man replies. 'She was here and    you could have.'

20090225035516AAK4A6Z	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Eastenders, Patrick Truman last night?	What was that all about? I thought the whole storyline was vague and distastefully approached. If they are going to tackle the issue of narrowminded racism of over half a century ago they should of tackled the subject all guns blazing or not at all.      I think I was most supprised when one of them said "what would Charlie think if he knew what you'd done?" Surely, as his friend, Charlie wouldnt judge a friend on his past misgivings of all those decades ago.      What exactly are eastenders trying to get at with this storyline? Who exactly is the young bloke who turned up looking for patrick? Are they going to tackle black-on-white racism at any point? which in my eyes is just as valid a plotline nowadays.      Opinions please?

Hi guys, I'm a singer in a heavy metal band and we have our first gig coming up in 4 days and (you guessed it) I'm suffering from hoarseness after our most recent practice (which was 2 nights ago). I am not a death metal singer, it is mostly melodic vocals delivered with an aggressive style (think early Metallica). I am often hoarse the day after practice (possibly due to a bad technique I am utilizing) but it does not usually persist for more than a day. I plan on getting vocal coaching in the long run but any "quick fix" solutions would be much appreciated!

20090225035836AAAOmlg	Entertainment & Music;Television;Other - Television	Can anyone remember this 1980's live action children's tv show in the US?	This is driving me crazy. Ive looked on like 5 different tv websites and have found nothing. As far as I can remember this was not a very popular show so I seriously doubt many people would remember it. I wouldve been watching it in the late eighties. It was on during the week, I think I watched it before getting on the bus but it couldve been after. I dont believe it was a Saturday morning cartoon. It started out with this man walking in the woods. He was tall and thin with salt and pepper hair, a little shaggy, but straight, and he had a beard. I think he wore a long sleeved red button up shirt. So anyways, he was walking through the woods on his way to this special hiding place, I guess once he got there he would tell stories or something. I dont know cause all I remember is the beginning where he would walk through the woods. I was only like 5 or 6 but I remember playing in my backyard and pretending that I had a cool hiding place and my little sisters and I would have to walk a long way and climb through bushes and things to get there. Anyways, I know this is vague, but I just thought maybe someone who was a couple years older would remember. I am 23. Thanks.

20090225044041AAs3ze7	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Are old jokes the best....A businessman meets a beautiful girl?	and agrees to spend the afternoon with her for $500. So they do. Before he leaves, he tells her that he does not have any cash with him, but that he will have his secretary write a check and mail it to her, calling the payment, "Rent For Apartment."      On the way to the office he regrets what he has done, realizing that the whole event was not worth the price. So he has his secretary send a check for $250 and encloses the following typed note:      "Dear Madam,      Enclosed find check in the amount of $250 for rent of your apartment. I am not sending the amount agreed upon, because when I rented the apartment, I was under the impression that:      1) It had never been occupied;   2) There was plenty of heat;   3) It was small enough to make me cozy and at home.      However, I found out that it had been previously occupied, that there wasn't any heat, and that it was entirely too large."      Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately returned the check for $250 with the following note:      "Dear Sir,      First of all, I cannot understand how you expect a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely. As for the heat, there is plenty of it, if you know how to turn it on. Regarding the space, the apartment is indeed regular, but if you don't have enough furniture to fill it, please do not blame the landlady."

20090225041013AA61AAb	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What's the wildest thing to happen to you at a party?	Keep in mind I was only 15, so this was extreme for me!      I went to this girl’s birthday party once…it started off really great because we thought we could have the music up as loud as we wanted because there was a deaf old lady next door. BUT only half an hour in the cops show up! They said that the old lady next door had complained that there was a body on her shed roof – lol, we found one of my friends already passed out on it.      Then everyone got very drunk, some a lot more than most. There were a few people on ecstasy and kept staring at the laser lights. There was a fight in the middle of her garden when some uninvited people crashed.       Then her dad (who doesn’t live with her anymore) came home and he didn’t know about the party. He got super mad, and picked up a hockey stick and started waving it around, hitting a few people, actually.       Then he called the cops.    By that stage everyone was like BAIL!    And nearly all the girls stuff, and other peoples’, got stolen and all the money she was given for her birthday was taken, and chairs were broken and about 100 drunk kids just ran out into the street at about 12:30 at night.       Well, everyone was like “TO THE PARK!”  and so I sort of remember going there…but then the police turned up and we scattered again. Then there was even a police helicopter with a searchlight and I even remember police dogs. Apparently there were so many complaints about the party that the police had sent out heaps out A LOT of police. So we all got to the station…and people were throwing and breaking bottles and running up and down the train tracks, jumping on cars and just causing a riot.       It all get’s a bit vague from my perspective, I just know I was sitting in the gutter with someone who had chips, and that I wasn’t wearing any shoes because I’d given them to a guy to hold because my feet hurt. At least he was good enough to stick around with them!       What's the most craziest party you've ever been to?

And then watch it on my TV? I have DVDs that can be slotted into my computer. How could I get the iTunes-bought movie onto a DVD? That's my question, basically.       Yes. Thank you in advance.....

20090225064020AAMZ2lO	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	What Band? What Song? This music video.?	Okay, so sometime last year I saw VH1 have one of there many specials. During the special they played a music video wit a song that I liked but I failed to get the name of the band or the song title. If someone could help identify here are somethings about the music video.      1. Lead singer had pink long hair MALE wearing a tight leotard type jumpsuit.   2. The video was based in outer space. On a spaceship.   3. Partway through the video some space monster attacks there ship.   The space monster looks like a giant squid.         That's all I can remember. I think the song mentioned love. Oh, and they had to like rock harder to destroy the monster. I think this might be an old song too. Much thanks if you can help!

Do Pisces usually act this way? and what are your experiences dating them.

20090225044539AATfbLl	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	A question for heavy metal fans.?	I like most metal bands - Lamb of God, Slayer, Metallica etc...   I also like other stuff like Nirvana's In utero, Pendulum, and even softer music(although I have a dislike for the "pop punk" bands roaming around these days. I do like punk music from the 80's etc.)   I'd like a response from people with similar taste -    People seem to hate Slipknot. I agree, that the mask thing is cheesy, but I personally don't think their music is all that bad. Although "Prosthetics" is the only Slipknot song I REALLY like, most people seem to flame them - calling them "emo", "not heavy enough" etc... But I don't really get it - They sound heavy. Some of the lyrics are not very mature, but only some. Also, I agree that "Before I forget" is not really a good METAL song, but not all their stuff sounds similar(I have barely listened to any of their music though). I ask this question to metal fans because non-metal fans seem to put forward the argument that all the lead singer does is roar. Well, all I can say is that everyone has tastes. Some people are peace loving and they like metal (System of a Down, anyone?). Us metal fans may go all "Bang bang boom boom" but that doesn't make us evil or anything. Like I said, I enjoy softer music as well. "To each his own."   Back to the question - I understand why non-metal fans may dislike Slipknot, but why do metal fans hate them?
20090225044712AAdbDeP	Entertainment & Music;Movies	UGH! this has been bothering me for days!?	Okay so i saw this movie years and years and years ago on DVD. I thought i knew what it was called but have discovered that i was wrong :(   So i remember a lot from the movie so hopefully someone can help...      - Okay so a girl has never really gotten on with her mother and then she hears that her mother has died.   - At her mothers funeral her mothers friends and widower are arguing about her make up and one gets out a lip stick and tries to fix it thus smudging it over her face.      - The woman mother returns to her as a ghost but as her younger self and starts behaving exactly as if she was alive.   - The woman finds out she is pregnant to her boyfriend and later on in the movie miscarries unexpectedly.      - I think the woman's boyfriend was a personal trainer?      - The Woman remembers that she was very close with her father but her father caught her mother having a affair years ago and resulted in his death from a heart attack? unexplained?      - The woman has a argument with her mothers ghost in the hospital after she has been told she miscarried, she then yells at her mother that she remember her" f***king that man in the cellar" she then throws a vase at her mother which goes right through her and her mothers ghost fades with tears in her eyes.      - Later after her daughter has forgiven her they encounter a situation with her mother widower where she is openly talking to her mothers ghost (asking if she wants anything to drink)      - Her late mothers widower is confused and a argument starts, where the woman defends her mother, then the argument reaches a peak where her mothers ghost appears to the widower and punches him knocking him out.      - at the end of the movie I believe the mothers ghost is driving away in a red car sing a song about Casanova?      Anybody have any Ideas? I'm longing to watch this movie again and hopefully purchase the DVD.      Many Thanks!!!

20090202102216AAr01Uc	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	How come on myspace karaoke other people....?	Okay, so whenever I listen to people on myspace karaoke, I'm thinking they're bad,  I look down and everybody is like "Wow you have a great voice man! Keep the good work up!!"   Why is this?! I mean seriously, people who really do suck get good ratings.   It happens on youtube too, I can think someone is bad singing a song and everybody else is like "Wow! Amazing!!"       Are other people just tone deaf, or just being nice, or what? I don't actually say "You suck" on their videos or anything, but like in my opinion people who aren't good, no offense to them, get a lot of good comments and ratings.      I'm not trying to be mean to those people.....   Does anyone feel the same way as I do?
20090202100503AAN1Xyb	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Who do you think is/was the most unlikely combination to come out of hip hop ?	I always thought how:       Lord Finesse would've been chosen as the only producer for Chronic 2001 considering there hasn't been a known previous connection with him and Dre.      DJ Quik connected with Peter Gunz, Erick Sermon, etc. This came out of nowhere, to me.      Anyone else you can think of that you thought had an unlikely connection?

Wouldn't it be great if you could just walk down the street singing a song,    and people just joined in..   I think pretty much everyone agrees with that, but when people actually do it, everyone just laughs at them or looks at them funny.   Isn't that strange?

I heard the song "Long Promised Road" by the Beach Boys (good song I never heard before) on the ABC show "Life On Mars" and I thought to post this survey hoping to score some other recommendations.      I listen to the whole spectrum of older songs so any group.  I recently heard "A Well Respected Man" by The Kinks and "Catch the Wind" by Donovan that I thought were both really good.

That leaves 140 million to do the work.               There are 85 million in school.                  Which leaves 55 million to do the work.                  Of this there are 35 million employed by the federal government.                  Leaving 15 million to do the work.                           2.8 million are in the armed forces preoccupied with killing Osama   Bin-Laden.            Which leaves 12.2 million to do the work.            Take from that total the 10.8 million people who work for state and city   Governments. And that leaves 1.4 million to do the work.                  At any given time there are 188,000 people in hospitals.            Leaving 1,212,000 to do the work.

20090202101714AAtnYg8	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	At what point in a successful musician's career do they need to abandon their upbringing to remain credible?	Happy Monday! :)      Since it's topical with the big game and all, I'm seeing lots and lots of complaints about The Boss and his music.  What he has written and produced does speak a great deal to the life and plight of the more common folk...a life much like his own upbringing in New Jersey.  Since he is no longer "common", though, some take issue with any material that speaks to that subject matter.      So I'm curious...at what level of success does a musician have to remove the focus off of any difficult elements of their past?  Is it centered around money, and they are no longer allowed to write about growing up poor after they've made their first million?  Or if a musician had a rough family life growing up, are they no longer allowed to speak of it if they get married, have a couple of kids and live happily ever after without being labeled as a fraud and a poseur?      And if you don't feel any of that is the case, how does a successful musician address the darker material of their own lives, or the lives around them, credibly?  Can it be done?      Thanks for reading through the babble!

They were supposed to be going to court; the female witness was not supposed to appear; the dealers found out & cut her face up with a knife.  She had 3 brothers who were, at first, thought to have shot the dealers.  At the end, a song was playing with the words, "All that I've ever known."  Whoever sings it, sounds somewhat like Unkle Bob on the track, "One by One".  Has anybody got any idea of what the song is called, and who it is by?  Thank you.  Christine

20090225055347AAgPz0g	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Y&R Kane, Lilly, Billy, Chloe and baby Cordilia?	What in the heck is up with that guy?  He finally has a chance to be with the woman he loves and then he just blows her off.  "I'm going to be like Chloe and live my life for myself and not care who gets hurt in the process."  Huh???  I never expected him to be such a jerk.  And for him to blame Lilly for not telling him that the baby wasn't his.  I think she was right in saying that it wasn't her place.  And the only time she could have said something would have been on the ridge before they went into the cabin.  I hope Chloe and Billy get what's coming to them.  When they kept talking about Chloe "dying" I figured that Kane would keep the baby and he would marry Lilly and they'd have the child that they lost.  But then Chloe didn't die and ruined the whole thing.  What a mess!  Just curious what everyone else thinks...

20090225055440AAAMI2S	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Greetings... and welcome. I trust that you are all wondering where you are?	I can assure you that while your location is not important, what these walls offer for your IS important... salvation, if you earn it. 3 hours from now the door to this house will open. Unfortunately, you only have 2 hours to live. Right now, you are breathing in a deadly nerve agent. You've been breathing it since you've arrived here. Those of you familiar with the Tokyo subway attacks will know its devastating effects on the human body. The only way to overcome it and walk out that door is to find an antidote. Several are hidden around this house. One is inside the safe in front of you. You all posess the combination to the safe. Think hard... the numbers are in the back of your mind. The clue to their order can be found "over the rainbow". Once you realize what you all have in common, you will gain a better understanding of why you're here. X marks the spot for that clue, so look carefully. Let the game begin.

20090225052349AA2nUdK	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Does anybody know this song?	So I can't stop thinking of this song that seems to bother me a lot...      I heard it first in one of the episodes of CSI ... It was the Intro music [the miniature killer..i think].      It has the lyrics saying "no tomorrow, no tomorrow" and other words repeated twice on the end of the stanza in the chorus.      It kinda sounds like Simon & Garfunkel's song "Sound of Silence" ,but the singer kinda sounds young like Jason Mraz [maybe it's him..idk].   it's all guitar and mellow with a kind of sad feeling...

I know they vary slightly from model to model but it's basically the same size. Classical guitars are fatter I know.   The reason I'm asking is...have you seen vids of Hendrix playing live?? His thumb goes all the way around over the top of the neck. He can play upto the D string from the top with his thumb. What I'm saying is he had HUUGE hands and I figure this would be a real advantage for anybody. So then why don't they make guitar necks thinner? Is it gonna **** up the sound in some way?

He is shown several possibilities that range from ￡50 to ￡150 in price, the more see-through, the higher the price.   He opts for the sheerest item, pays the ￡150 and takes the lingerie home.   He presents it to his wife and asks her to go upstairs, put it on and model It for him.   Upstairs, the wife thinks, "I have an idea. It's so see-through that it might as well be nothing.   I'll not put it on, do the modelling naked and return it tomorrow and get a ￡150 refund for myself".   So she appears naked at the top of the stairs and strikes a pose.   The husband says, "My God! It wasn't that creased in the shop".   His funeral is on Thursday

I remember and episode of tom and jerry where there was a robot maid. She slightly resembled Rosie from the jetsons, but she made sounds like "mep mep," and the ends of her arms turned into vacuums. She is consistently stopping tom from getting jerry and he tricks her into getting destroyed. He puts her robot remains in the garbage and the wire on her head sends out a signal that calls two more robot's to the house and they end up chasing tom into the sunset, and that's the ending. Anyone remember this or know what the episode name is? I can't find it anywhere.

20090225064257AAObIRC	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Help identify this modern pop song, sounds like Avril: "runs and she hides" - "tears from her eyes"?	Yesterday in a supermarket, I heard a beautiful song. I tried to remember the lyrics so I could look it up later, but lost my keys and the stress from that caused me to forget the lyrics mostly. But I do remember them somewhat. I remember the singer sounded like Avril, and the lyrics contained something like this, "runs and she hides" or it was "she goes and she hides" and think "wipes the tears from her eyes" or "tears in her eyes". Part of the tune was very easy to remember and I could probably reproduce it with a keyboard. The strange thing (or maybe it's not a coincidence) is that when looking up various versions of the lyrics, Avril did come up and it was related to a song called Runaway, which seemed to have the same lyrics, BUT it did not sound like the same song at all. It also wasn't a song with seemingly the same lyrics, and THE SAME TITLE (coincidence?) sung by Damn Yankees. Whatever I heard sounded like it was made after 2000. I'd never heard it before. One more thing is that I think something like this may have been in the lyrics, "Wherever she goes" or "Wherever she hides" or "Wherever she is" or "Whatever she says"...

20090203144420AArJyf7	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Edward Cullen vs. Space Marine?	I was having a really long argument with my sister about who would win in a fight. She reads the Twilight books, so of course she thinks that Edward(or any other vampire or werewolf from that book) could beat a space marine. So who do you guys think would win? I bet a whole lot of girls will answer this question and say something along the lines of "Edward will win, he is so hot" or something stupid like that without ever actually thinking about the question. If you dont know what a space marine is you can look them up on wikipedia or a wikia for Warhammer 40000(40k). Please be realistic and dont say one side would win just because you like them more. This is not a popularity question, but an actual who would win in a fight type thing. Say who and also state why. Consider both people and both of their powers. By the way it doesnt matter which Space Marine Chapter he fights, just a basic(whichever) single space marine.

20090203150141AATOtTD	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Contest: Really hard riddles (10 points)?	The story behind Einstein's riddle is that Albert Einstein created it in the late 1800s, and claimed that 98% of the world population couldn't solve it. I am not sure of the true origin, but I have seen this one floating around the internet, and it is a good brain exercise. Here it is:      - In a street there are five houses, painted five different colors.      - In each house lives a person of different nationality.      - These five homeowners each drink a different kind of beverage, smoke different brand of cigar and keep a different pet.      Einstein's riddle is: Who owns the fish?      Necessary clues:      1. The British man lives in a red house.   2. The Swedish man keeps dogs as pets.   3. The Danish man drinks tea.   4. The Green house is next to, and on the left of the White house.   5. The owner of the Green house drinks coffee.   6. The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.   7. The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill.   8. The man living in the center house drinks milk.   9. The Norwegian lives in the first house.   10. The man who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.   11. The man who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.   12. The man who smokes Blue Master drinks beer.   13. The German smokes Prince.   14. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.   15. The Blends smoker lives next to the one who drinks water.      Even I can't do the whole thing but i found out the answer once this contest is closed i'll post the link    good luck ;)

My pet goldfish Lou, his wife and their triplets asked me for a bigger castle. I told him to get a job, and pay a deposit, and I then pay a reminder of the mortgage (times are tough). He applied here and  there, but no one would hire a goldfish. Then, by chance, he saw that  audition in the newspapers, applied, and was chosen to play Dorothy  in Sesame Street (apparently, they do not care if the goldfish a male  or female, good looks is everything). They even hired his wife as a  double! I am afraid that he will go to Hollywood and will never come  back to his aquarium, and will forget me! What should I do?
