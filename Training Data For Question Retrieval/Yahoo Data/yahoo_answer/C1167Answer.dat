eN5xA6RKaa	Ive been wondering the same thing. tattoos are personal we have no idea what would look best on someone and if it fits them. i would never ask a stranger what tattoo to get, considering its permanent. i get tattoos i want, and i dont really care if other people like them because they are for me not them..<br>  and i hate the questions of price..there is no way to determine how much a pic of a tattoo they post will be..every artist charges different amounts and stuff like that.|`|X6DIkFl2aa	That's funny, I was just about to ask you what tattoo I should get. Nevermind now. lol.<br>  <br>  Edit: Good idea. A tramp stamp sounds nice. And since I am a dude, it might be a cool idea to get boobs tattooed on my chest. Why not huh?|`|obIMwp99aa	its just because they want lots of options so that they can have a good range of choices before choosing, seeing how its something that will have to be with you forever.|`|XaYHMNusaa	I've been wondering this myself.|`|WsR2Xlpxaa	I don't ask what kind to get, but will occasionally ask what people think of a design...  or which to get first.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Good Question, maybe because they are bored and are thinking of getting a tattoo and they are curious what other people think.|`|PPvk105Caa	Some people are too media influenced to think for themselves, that's why there are so many d-bags with the exact same tribal tattoo around their arm. Tattoo is becoming a fad, & less likely to be considered original artistic impressions. Everyone other person in the world will eventually have the same tattoo. <br>  <br>  It drove me insane, being in high school 3 years ago & seeing person after person getting the tattoo of Jesus's hands praying with "R.I.P" so & so, next thing you know, more people are getting it. I swore that these people were just waiting for someone to drop dead so they could get the tattoo.
Vqytq5Diaa	i like MAC too<br>  but then again, we waste all  this momey not realizing that sometimes the good stuff is not expensive, sometimes all we need is a wal mart mascara or eyeliner. <br>  for foundation i definetely go with MAC<br>  eye shadow and blush i go with wal mart n longs|`|evEJxv06aa	i use the mac one and here's a site to find the best makeup it's called <br>  laura mercier.com|`|cQNOWMktaa	I like Maybelline, it's affordable and pigmented.<br>  MAC is really good, just a rip-off to me.<br>  <br>  I use Coastal Scents Palettes; All their eyeshadows are just like MAC, except you can get 88 for $20 plus shipping.|`|JoUsPyI6aa	Benefit totally. They have great blush, bronzer, lip gloss, and everything! And great lash is always good too.|`|uLDWMzSHaa	Benefit Cosmetics<br>  Its cute adorable and GOOD!
9QSxT7tdaa	I just think it is funny that you have practically the same screen name as your "son" Nice way to get around the age 13+ rule. But for now I am going to ignore the fact that you are a pathetic troll and answer the question.<br>  <br>  No.. For several reasons. It is illegal for one thing, no matter who signs for it. His body will grow and change drastically over the next ten years and that ink will look screwed up by the time he is an adult. And no one should get hand tattoos at all until they are a responsible adult with a good career that allows it and has thought and planned for a long time about it.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Personally i think 12 is too young because he has A lot of growing to do, but if he is really set on the RIP tattoo and you are not against it then i would let him get it but instead of his arm somewhere else like his chest. I would make my children wait until they were 18 tho. i have 6 tattoo and i waited until i was 18.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	12?! That's wrong. Sorry but this child is too young to know what he wants. Too young for anything permanent. He can wait until he is at least 18.<br>  <br>  Maybe you think he has a good idea but he is way too young. You need to be a parent and tell him no.|`|PPvk105Caa	12 is too young, if he really wants a tattoo that bad, tell him to wait until he's 16 & if he still wants the tattoo, he could get it done. But odds are, he'll change his mind next year, next month etc. Sure I bet he misses his grandmother, but honestly, every person from my junior class got the exact same tattoo, the hands praying with "R.I.P" under it. I started to think they were just looking for a reason to get ink. No offense but tattooing is being more of a trend then anything originally being artistic & meaningful.|`|3lCeMP2Gaa	No. Make him wait till he is 18, it's ILLEGAL to have a tattoo done under this age. If a tattoo artist is willing to break the law and tattoo your child then who knows what else they are willing to do like not sterilise the needle etc.<br>  <br>  Anyone that tattoos a minor is breaking the law and could end up in prison/with a large fine and would lose their job. <br>  <br>  Tell him to wait till he is 18 and get something beautiful that his nan would be proud of, not some nasty crappy tattoo that he's going to regret by the time he is 20.|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	I am sure someone in your trailer park can do if fer him cheap like.  What the heck are you thinking? Oh, you not? That explains a lot! <br>  <br>  You should give him up for adoption if you are considerin' this! You are unworthy to parent!|`|BZEN8QXbaa	He is way to young,no shop would tattoo him..The youngest most will tattoo with parents permission is 16..But i always say its best to wait till your 18..|`|cQIErkCxaa	so you want your son to look at his hand every second, and slowly become more depressed? i know it sounds aweful, but i have lost many family members, and you just have to remember they will always be with you, but you need to move on. having pernament markings on your skin of their name is not going to help remorse what so ever.|`|YSVttvBAaa	Don't let him. It's adorable he wants to have a tattoo of his grandmother, but he could be just doing it so that you will let him have the other one. Wait a few years and see if he wants it again. I used to want to dye my hair red- now I cringe at the thought of looking like a highlighter.|`|y2gBPwUVaa	12 is way to young. just because he likes it now doesn't mean he is going to like it when he is older and especially one on his hand. he will eventually need to get a job and have to cover it up. i would made him wait and then if he is older and still likes it then he can go get it.|`|AA10063288	Absolutely not. He is way to young to determine whether or not he wants to put something permanent like that on his body. For now, let him keep her memory close in the form of a photo or poem or something. When he turns 18, he can get his own tat.|`|jzjGdvvgaa	NO! Letting a 12-year-old get a tattoo = EPIC FAIL. He's young, there's a very good chance he'll regret it. If he wants one that much, you should make him wait until he's 16 at least, and see if he still wants it.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	he can wait till he is older. she will still be dead, and later, his body wont be changing as much.<br>  <br>  as for the computer, thats just stupid|`|PefglUNaaa	no, he's way too young. i think you should wait, cuz he might regret it.|`|6cfb8e9d797a22eab05ad802ea3154f2aa	No way, who is the parent here?. He is way to young to get a tattoo. <br>  My God he is not even a teenager yet!.<br>  I was left to raise myself when i was 14 and i got two on my hand and i regret it to this day. The hands are Never a good place to get them anyways.<br>  He Will Regret it, if he gets it on his hand Guaranteed.<br>  If by the time he is 16 and he still wants it, then by all means let him, but try your best to Convince him that the hands and wrists are terrible places to put them. <br>  I hope you listen to the Majority rather than the Minority here.|`|IIo1AFPlaa	im 15, and a girl. dont let him get one untill hes at least 16. his skin is still growing. i plan on getting almost the same tattoo for my grandad, but when im older. oh, and im almost positive he'll grow out of wanting the computer. make a plan for when hes older. tell him when he has a job, and can pay for half. be strong and sure about your decision though, or else he'll think you can be cracked.|`|Tldy0N0iaa	No don't let him get it, and definitely don't let your friend do it tell him to wait until he is 18 and he will be able to get it done by a professional, any responsible parent wouldn't let their kid get a  tatto oat 12.
AAp5DFEBaa	Yes, definitely, sunsuits are sexy.<br>  I like the dark blue best I guess, because of the model and hi-heels I think.<br>  Sunsuits are sexy yet conservative enough for most women to wear.<br>  I prefer wearing Sundresses myself.<br>  With hi-heels of course : )<br>  <a href="http://s240.photobucket.com/albums/ff202/SexyJeanieD/?action=view&current=BW_Sundress.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s240.photobucket.com/albums/ff202...</a>|`|KXmMlqA9aa	I'm not a fan of them.

4XKCa47haa	foot locker, nike, champs, or online.
hE4CXKX2aa	Wow this is a tough one.  You are living on your own.  Yet your mom said she will kill you if you get a tattoo.  Maybe she is trying to make you respectable towards yourself.  Even thou tattoos are not necessary bad themselves.  Maybe it is for religious reasons, but who knows.  It is really your choice in the matter since you are on your own.  Unless your mom is helping you in some manner that deals with money / school or such.  But also you could show more respect by not getting one.  And that type of sacrifice in not getting one would show that you love her and respect her.|`|b46BnmmIaa	Have you asked your mother why she is so opposed to it?  I think her opposition comes from a concern that you will regret it someday.  <br>  <br>  What kind of tattoo are you considering?  Where do you intend to have it?  How big will it be?  Those are just a few of the questions you should consider.  <br>  <br>  I have NEVER regretted my tattoo.  That is probably because I get it in memory of a very good friend.  In fact, he was a true friend.  <br>  <br>  Consider your mother's viewpoint.  I say that despite the simple truth that this is ultimately your decision.|`|AA11004428	you only need your parents consent if youre 18 or younger. youre an adult now. if you want to get a tattoo get one. it has nothing to do with respect. (in my opinion)|`|AA11950233	depends what you want to get. consider the future & how it may limit your career opportunities.|`|7d1bcd83d6c3611b6f659779f4f9e017aa	I'd get the tattoo. If she loves you, then she will love you even if you get one or not.|`|BZEN8QXbaa	If you were living at home i would say yes,but you are on your own...Do what you want..|`|XaYHMNusaa	If you want one, get it.  It's your body, not hers.|`|obIMwp99aa	now your out of her permission, do what you want and live a little!|`|ueKozAVTaa	Well, I think you should respect her opinion. But because she's a mother, she'd like you anyway even if you do go ahead and get the tattoo done. Why do you want to get a tattoo anyway? Its a waste, think about it well enough before you go ahead. Always remember that we owe a lot to our mothers.|`|JVzwHwx6aa	you can do whatever you wants now but if ur mom is that important to you .you can try (henna)its like tattoo.you can get it in black or brown and its really cool and don't last for ever|`|mQhqRbRQaa	I think it all depends on you, but I would have done it anyway. I believe now it's your decision, because you are an adult.|`|y2gBPwUVaa	just get it, or get it some where you can hide from her and just never show her it.|`|eOiAfudfaa	Live your life, do as you please!|`|A0nRQHDCaa	I am almost 20 as well, my poor mom is from singapore and was devastated when I got my first tattoo.<br>  <br>  I got them regardless because I am my own person but I respect her when she asks me to cover them up for whatever reason it may be when we are out together.<br>  <br>  I know alot of kids are going to thumbs down me for covering them up but let's be real, it's my mother.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	If you want to continue to make her happy then that is up to you. You are no longer living with her whatever you do is up to you you can ask her for advice but you dont have to take it. Also you can consider putting it in a spot where you can hide it.|`|AA11557192	Normally I take the mom's side.  And as a mom I would not want my kids getting a tattoo.<br>  <br>  However if you are over 18 and are not living at home, she can tell you what she thinks but it is your decision.<br>  <br>  I think tatoos are trashy and they could be painful and expensive to remove. But it is up to you.|`|0ef851000b538b263ac2c3058c608291aa	get the tattoo. everyone has their own brain to make their own decision. just cause you get a tattoo dosent mean you respect her opinion any less. its just an opinion, if everyone had the same opinion then the world would be a very boring place. variety is the spice of life.|`|hnhb119Laa	It depends which matters more to you.. the tattoo, or your mother's approval.  So what if your mother never loves you again?  At least you'll have some cool ink to show off on the beach this summer.|`|ss48BEk5aa	My mom was 40 before she dared get a tattoo! LMAO. Just get it somewhere she won't see! And if she does, oh well. It's your body and your old enough to take care of yourself.
obIMwp99aa	just think that your always going to be rejected so you wont be surprised if it happens. also it will make you more surprised and happy if you dont get rejected. also before doing whatever your doing, make sure that you really think it through so that theres not so much of a chance to be rejected in the first place|`|XCzpQvDvaa	1 night stand will perk up the confidence level
ZbLa5lHdaa	yes!<br>  <br>  do a like lavender color!<br>  <br>  honetly, on ebay you can get some amazing posters for your wall.<br>  go to antuque stores for furniture! not ikea for everything. if you have an ikea where you are. hah idk.<br>  <br>  hope i helped girl!|`|IUeav3oXaa	Hi!! Doesn't matter how old you are if you enjoy Barbie's that's so cool! If it was me I get my stuff at Walmart. Beautiful things and good prices.I would paint the walls a light brown and at top of wall around the room put barbie wallpaper trim. I think also a barbie rug or barbie sheets and blankets, and yes barbies around the room!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)|`|ZSEBueCbaa	1. No, unless your really young! Go for something more sophisticated.<br>  2. Pink, if thats the colour theme you want.<br>  3. Don't do it!<br>  <br>  Go for something really modern and funky.|`|S1KINm2Paa	It depends on how old you are, barbies are for very young girls. Just remember that if you do this and go all out barbie theme and in a year or so you grow out of that stage you are going to be stuck in a room that you hate. You know what Im saying? But I will give you my advice if this is what you really want =)<br>  <br>  2. Pink. You could get the top (or/and) bottom of the walls to have a bold strip of another color. It adds more to the room.<br>  <br>  3. You can go to Walmart, they have some nice things. As far as pillows, rugs, lamps. But pbteen.com has some great comforters and sheets. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pbteen.com/shop/girls-bedding/index.cfm?cm_type=gnav" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbteen.com/shop/girls-bedding...</a>|`|fbIhtNSdaa	maybe you could theme it like old fashioned diner, and have bright colors such as orange and pink, and maybe black.  I think you should paint the walls an old fashioned color, such as yellow.  Places you could buy this stuff are Ikea, Pottery Barn Teen (PB Teen), or even department stores such as target.<br>  <br>  hope i helped & good luck :)|`|wnBkuzpzaa	Well...I personally wouldn't be caught dead with a room like that...but if you like it, go for it. Yellow and Pink walls. Go to target.|`|YSmYkc5Yaa	It's a good idea...if you're like 8 years old. So I'm hoping you are.|`|Z4HD1hgFaa	if you're over 10 barbies in your room are off limits. its creepy
4bp6r6yJaa	Allrighty, he cheated on her, so logicly, she broke up with him. He must be stupid to have the ordacity to cheat on any girl. It's not right and she needs to understand that it is not her fault!! And by the way, 6 months is a heck of a long time to still be crying over a boy! Like I said, its not her fault and she needs to get over him! Convince her to go to the mall. Shopping always makes me feel better, and buy her the fattest chocolate chip cookie she's ever seen! Scope the mall for cute boys! Get her to get over him! Or get some of your friends and have a party, invite lots of cute guys!!! But most of all, let her know that you are there for her, and that its not her fault that her dumb jerk of an ex-boyfriend cheated on her, and that she is way too good for him anyways.|`|7a813a13c5a830c32a2ab6c4a8e4730aaa	maybe you to should spent more time together do something fun with her so she can take her mind of him.<br>  maybe help her get to know someone else.<br>  go shopping go to a movie.<br>  sleep over and do nails and stuff<br>  or sit with her and let her cry and get it all off her.<br>  do nice things for her.<br>  it must be hard.|`|vJYesZ5Zaa	Well, depending on how long they were together can cause a certain amount of hurt. ALso, the fact that she was cheated on is something that is probably stuckin her head and hurting her whenever she thinks about it. I would say to just let her talk to you about it and just listen. Do this often. ALso, take her out and do stuff with her to try to keep her mind off of it. Over time she will get over what happened and move on hey who knows, maybe she will find another guy while you two are hanging out together.!! :)
KXXSI6Bmaa	I think it is call wrecking balm, or something like that.  I saw a commericial, but have no idea if it would actually work.|`|0xO8Y98uaa	Boilsheet, indeed.  The only way to even attempt to remove a tattoo is through repeated laser treatments, which are expensive and could leave you scarred anyway.  The most I would expect from such a cream would be hideous blurring.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	You should research it on google. Or try it and see if it work. It would be a hit if it worked tho.|`|BZEN8QXbaa	You can fade them allot,but it never takes them fully away..

yFjAIvsKaa	Tanning beds are generally considered to be more dangerous than the regular sun, though both can lead to skin cancer. The UV rays in both cause your skin to thin, and become easier to damage. It is also a myth that getting a base tan protects you from burning, or from sun damage. Individuals with dark skin tones (i.e., black, asian, hispanic, etc.) can still get sun burns, though it may take longer to happen. Also, higher elevations increase the intensity of the UV rays, so you can burn faster. <br>  <br>  Doctors recommend avoiding direct sunlight as much as possible, by staying indoors, staying in the shade, wearing clothing and hats that cover your skin, and using a sunscreen of at least spf 15. Of course it is impossible for most people to stay completely out of the sun, so covering up is the best option. In addition, the summer sun is not the only problem. You should be using a sunscreen year round on exposed skin, as UV rays can still cause damage even if it is a cloudy day, or the weather is cold. <br>  <br>  Doctors and researchers say that all tanning is bad, and can lead to skin cancer, as well as premature aging of the skin (i.e., wrinkles), but they are especially concerned about tanning beds, because the concentration of UV rays is 2-5 times higher in these beds than in natural sunlight. They recommend getting a spray tan instead. <br>  <br>  Of course there is the other side of this debate: those who manufacture tanning beds insist that all of the research is wrong, and that their beds really are safer than the sun. I tend not to take the word of an obviously biased group, however. It is up to you, of course, whether you want to continue tanning. Just make sure that if you do, you are doing regular skin checks to look for moles and other skin damage. Women tend to get skin cancer on the backs of their legs, but don't just check there. Even clothing doesn't keep out 100% of UV rays, so you have to check everywhere. <br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful for you. I would also recommend talking to a dermatologist or a doctor, because they may have more information for you.|`|Q3D9G09Maa	They are both equally as bad. The issue is 'burning', like you said you wouldn't mind buring cause that's what you do. That's how the whole skin cancer and everything comes up is when people burn. If you apply sun tan lotion appropriately and throughout the day and gradually do it, you're better off.  Just don't burn.<br>  <br>  :D|`|NLXhW9rBaa	Don't worry about it.  You can use a self-tanner (one preferably not with harmful chemicals)  or just put on some tanning lotion|`|wnnudNp5aa	The sun and tanning beds both contain Ultra Violet rays. These UV rays are what causes tanning, but also can cause skin cancer. Of course you cannot avoid the sun in summer (or winter, for that matter), that's why protection is so important. The best protection is a high SPF sunscreen. SPF stands for sun protection factor. The higher the number, the more it protects you from the bad UV rays. It will also prevent sunburns. Forget getting a dark tan, or get a fake one. Always use a high SPF sunscreen on exposed skin when you go outside, and you'll greatly lessen the chance of getting skin cancer.

Q3D9G09Maa	Yes, that is blonde.  A sandy blonde with light blonde streaks is extremely cute.... but i'm actually leaning toward brunette #1 for your overall appearance.. You look cute.  I agree that the blonde is better for summer, with highlights.<br>  <br>  :D|`|0G1fOjpWaa	that blonde shade is more like brown, having said that though you look much prettier with the darker hair, keep it, dont go lighter...|`|cpfcRw0Oaa	i like the lighter color for the summer and the darker for the winter. <br>  i agree, get some bangs :)|`|Z4HD1hgFaa	brunette. and that is not blonde. thats brown with dark blonde highights and it looked bad|`|JPkgKCNtaa	the blonde.|`|vzgT0ZlXaa	i like the blonde.<br>  have you ever thought of getting bangs ?|`|u3In152caa	blonde.|`|ZbLa5lHdaa	you call that blonde?|`|uAUswWcJaa	Brunette , yu are very pretty.|`|AsQkzj3daa	that "blond" is brunette, so this is a one option question, sorry to say:( but i like the brunette without highlights... i no this girl who does the exact same thing u do, and i get so annoyed when she calls herself blond when shes really brown with un-natural blond highlight for her bangs.... so this question was for nothing...|`|ZSEBueCbaa	The blonde doesn't look much different to be honest! --<br>  More like highlights, but its nice and looks good.|`|S1KINm2Paa	Definitely brunnette.

MRekIzQSaa	No, you shouldn't let her kick you in the balls. That could really hurt you, and if she does it to hard, could even send you to the hospital. It could also make you sterile.. <br>  If she loved you and cared for you, she would NOT want to hurt you like that. That is really terrible. Especially if she is serious with you and wants the best chances of having children with you, if it comes to that point.<br>  She could ruin your body by kicking you there.. And, like I said, make you really sick. Nobody should do that.<br>  The best thing you can do is work on your trust (which.. ballkicking isn't going to help) and assure her the best you can that it won't happen again.<br>  In the end, she has to have faith in you and trust you. If she can't get over her mistrust and anger, your relationship will fail. Kicking you in the balls might make her feel better short term, but it will not fix her insecurities that you cheating on her have caused.|`|VAeOb9dfaa	no way shes crazy!<br>  why would you want to physically hurt someone you  love.<br>  <br>  tell her to go make out with a guy and your even...|`|U19Q8dunaa	if shes asking you to do stuff for her, then shes probably not worth it (and, don't let her kick you anywhere).

ZkrGttKaaa	Q.#1. You can wear a loose fitting t-shirt, but do not rebandage. It has to be able to breathe. Q.#2. You can use several things. Personally, I like Aquaphor, but Bacitracin, A&D, Lubiderm, or almost any hand or skin moisturizing lotion will work, provided you don't put it on too thick. A little works better. If you put too much, the scab can come off prematurely, before the pigment in it has a chance to dye the skin. A lot of folks don't realize it, but the ink comes out with the scab. What's left over is dyed skin... your tattoo. Sounds like he had his machine tuned to hit a little hard, if it bruised the bone. So, for Q.#3, the answer is to grin and bear it. My whole chest is done, too, and I know what you're talking about. Next time you get work done over a sensitive or bony spot, ask your man if he might happen to have an iron machine with eight-wrap coils, that he can run at around seven volts. It might chap him off, if he doesn't have one; but if he does, it'll be a breeze by comparison. Take care, my friend!|`|s4q8M2fAaa	do not re wrap your tattoo. keep it uncovered when you sleep.<br>  as for bruising, not much you can do there...<br>  try unfragranced Aveeno Baby, great for tattoos, not sticky or anything, but gives you a great amount of moisture|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	after the first 24 hours you dont need to cover them. just dont pick at the scabs when they appear. you can use a&d creme or the shop should have given you some.  good luck!!|`|rFMRgHTdaa	You can use A&D ointment you can find it in the baby aisle. It worked really good on my 6 tattoo's. No don't put anything on it while you sleep the bruising will just have to go away with time. You can put a&d ointment in the morning afternoon and evening and once it starts to scab put lotion on it and you should be fine.|`|BZEN8QXbaa	A old t-shirt will work,just in case it oozes...As for the bruising its a hit or miss,nothing you can really do about it..

tXFUjooBaa	When you go up to bigger sizes, (8 and below), you have to use tapers.<br>  Never stretch with pinchers or just try to shove the plug in.<br>  It won't work, and it will hurt your ear and cause possible blow outs.<br>  Wait a month before each size, and try not to skip sizes.<br>  I skipped a couple small sizes and nothing went wrong, but I do not recommend it.<br>  A rule of thumb is that if it hurts really bad (like a 6 or 7 out of ten or above) your body is NOT ready to stretch up a size, so waiting another week or two is advisable. <br>  Treat your stretched ears as a new piercing each time you stretch; do sea salt soaks every day, two times a day until it doesn't hurt AT ALL to twist the earring.<br>  Remember to have a size goal, as stretching is addictive and if you decide to not have stretched lobes in the future, may be hard to reverse.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your ears<3<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  <br>  Your ears WILL go back to normal sizes, provided you do not stretch past 0's. If you do decide to stretch past a 0 however, most holes look natural without the earring in, (as long as you're not at like a half inch.)|`|gwindStOaa	don't do it... your ears won't go back if you get the hole too big... then you'll have to have surgery to repair it if you don't want holes...|`|e193294baa8d6ba952ee479ba5e75b52aa	not that ive heard of

It is it's essence.<br>  <br>  or this part over your heart:<br>  'here is the deepest secret nobody knows'<br>  <br>  I think that you need some image design incorporated or having the words make an image.

PTydjBFHaa	the difference between highlights and low lights is that highlights lighten the hair and low lights darken it. so basically it just takes a section of hair and dyes it either lighter or darker then the rest of your hair. From looking on your 360 pics i don't know if your hair is darker or lighter right now. but this is exactly what i would tell your stylist is that you want to dye your hair one shade above black (dont worry its not too dark and it looks really good you can ask to see sample hair colors of the dye before if your freaked out by this) then i would tell her that you want platinum highlights. i have this in my hair and SOOOO many people compliment me ALL of the time! i know you might think that it sounds drastic but it looks SOOO good! good luck && when you get it done deff post a pic! also you might want to think about for your cut to get long angled side bangs and layers and maybe even shorten your hair just a bit like 2 maybe 3 inches. your hair will look much healthier. just make sure you go to a stylist you trust and ask around if you don't know anyone. whenever i switch to a new stylist i tell the person on the phone "look i know your technically not supposed to tell me this but i have had some bad experiences and i'm sure that all of your stylists do an amazing job but who in your personal opinion would you recommend for me that will listen and really give me the best results." and the girls always tell me their personal opinion && i trust them && so far they have always been right.

OBnNGcfHaa	As long as you wait till its healed you will be fine.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	As long as it's completely healed, you can treat it as you would the rest of your skin.<br>  <br>  Standard makeup won't cover it though, you'll need specialist makeup for scars and blemishes etc. I hear Dermablend is quite good. Or stage makeup, that they use to hide things like tattoos on models or actors, I hear people use that with some success.|`|lQPKIBcUaa	If the tattoo has healed, it is fine to put makeup on it. If it hasn't, though, you definitely shouldn't - you risk infection.|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	as long as its healed its fine.

QVrEEmFHaa	It makes your hair feel reallllllllllllly soft and silky. I love it, it's amazing lol. Plus it's pretty cheap.|`|ezI5HwRWaa	There really aren't any good products to stops your ends from being fried. You really should stop straightening your hair. I used to straighten mine every day and it just ruined my hair. I tried a lot of protectors but none of them really worked. No product is going to help your hair unless you stop straightening it and then let it grow out. <br>  <br>  Try styling your hair a different way so that you don't have to straighten it all of the time. My hair has been getting healthier since I stopped and I'm used to it now, I don't straighten my hair often.<br>  <br>  Aussie 3 minute miracle is great actually. It makes my hair feel smooth and it just feels healthier after I use it. But like I said, it isn't going to heal your hair as long as you continue to straighten it.

So go ahead.|`|K0PNbcjYaa	it depends how you wear it.<br>  my friend wears her shirts like super high up, just so people see her ring, and i swear she looks so trashy.<br>  <br>  but if you can cover it, but show it when you need to, then your fine.<br>  <br>  i dont judge girls if they have their belly button peircings, it just depends if they give people a reason to talk.<br>  <br>  if you want it get it, im getting mine done in a week ;]|`|3ULHZzVTaa	I wouldn't do it.  Well, obviously not now since I'm past that age, but when I was younger the thing that held me back was the fact that I had and still have an active lifestyle and I didn't feel like it would fit in.  I do martial arts, so I was concerned about rings catching on my clothing and tearing.  I'd imagine the same would be true if you are an adventurous type who would want to try rappelling, skydiving or any other harnessed sport.  I also worried about infection.  Just the thought of it... yuck!<br>  <br>  As far as being judged... everyone seems to have them these days - at least around where I live.  My super conservative sister in law had one for a long time.  What's there to judge?  I wouldn't give it a second thought if I saw you with one.  Of course this opinion is coming from someone living near San Francisco and Berkeley where people have LOTS of things pierced, so take it as you will!|`|ZCG1C3PBaa	belly button piercings are hotter on fit and athletic chicks than on sluts and rednecks|`|bo3wPYf7aa	yeah when i see a girl with her belly button pierced i think it makes her look a little trashy.<br>  don't do it!

Just be patient.|`|6zDyDOSwaa	no|`|iGYUDPKhaa	I asked my hairstylist that a while ago lol.<br>  No, no matter what you do, you can't speed up the process of hair growth.<br>  You just have to be patient.<br>  But if you want to HELP your hair grow, eat a lot of food with Vitamin E or just take Vitamin E pills like I am.<br>  It doesn't speed up the process, but it just helps your hair grow.<br>  lol.<br>  I hope it helps.|`|1YR6c4XLaa	you can use head and shoulders and try a little bit of baby oil cause oil makes your hair grow fast. i had got my hair cut not to long ago. and it was like past my lower back, and it's only been about five months and now it's almost at the same spot.

vUUTq18raa	It's all person preferance :)  If you have a man and aren't picky, ask him what he'd prefer, or simply decide what feels nice for you by yourself.<br>  <br>  Me, I keep it very closely trimmed, and shaved, but not all shaved off.  It's clean, easy to keep up with.<br>  <br>  Waxing is nice, but you have to let the hair grow back to a certain length BEFORE they have enough hair to wax it again, so keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  Shaving does indeed grow back a little stubbly, so you'll have to keep up with it if you start it.<br>  <br>  Laser removal is idea.  One time thing, and your good to go.|`|VGy0iFMAaa	Shaved and sometimes I leave some hair.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	There is no "norm", but you'd think there was given all the little kids asking questions about it on here.<br>  <br>  I shave all mine and believe me, yours was bristly in the first place.<br>  <br>  Waxing is excruciating, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.|`|Qh01Ey7Daa	i shave ever 2-3 days.  it's better than being all bushy.  i would wax, but <br>  <br>  1.  i would think it to be extremely painful.<br>  2.  it can cause ingrown hairs, and that's painful, too.<br>  <br>  lol|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	it depends. if i am going away to a different country where i will be wearing a bathing suit then i get rid of it all. if i am just here at home i will get rid of some.

Personally i wouldn't go bare but if that's what you want sure. Shaving is not good cause it grows back thicker and rougher and you'll have little red bumps. you could also use scissors to just trim strays.|`|kNJBwpgNaa	The same thing happens to my skin when I shave, but I am going to try waxing this summer. Laser removal would be ideal if you can afford it. And you can do it all if you want, or leave some (ask your man if you want, he might have an opinion ;) Good luck!|`|qeNrGoMsaa	My Daughters wax it. Or trim and shave te bikini line. Waxing is not easy but it will give you longer time with out hair growth. and less red bumps.|`|cpfcRw0Oaa	i make a little triangular shape(trimmed) and shave or get the rest waxed|`|nn8AdxnZaa	i remove it all!<br>  idk<br>  it feels gross having to me<br>  haha but it's all up to you|`|bwipwWTaaa	I shave it.|`|QeALCWbqaa	shave|`|ZOM7XVcCaa	Trim
fqIE566Caa	Yes, take it to the dress maker & request it. I've seen a dress be made into a corset when it was too small for the person wearing it (on tv) so it should be perfectly easy for the dress maker to change this. Just be very specific and make sure she takes measurements to ensure the dress will still fit you (however as you will have skin showing, it should do). Good luck!|`|aZRUHzn7aa	This should be rather simple for a descent seamstress. If it were me (granted I sew quite often) I would remove the zipper and perhaps add button holes on either side and lace it up. I would say for someone who knows what they're doing, this can be done easily.
24sK6L2uaa	It takes 6 to 8 weeks to heal clean it with sea salt soaks on the outside. If you want it changed go back in and say I really don't like this jewelry its not me can I change it to something else and have them do it. I got a little blue jewel for mine.|`|XaYHMNusaa	Next week is way too soon to change it, you may change it after it heals.<br>  Sea salt soaks [1/4 teaspoon salt for every 8 oz of warm water] are the best way to take care of it.  Avoid rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, Neosporin, Bactine, and other things w/ excessive chemicals.  Soaps [even Dial] can be too harsh on a fresh piercing.|`|fc99ad979846be06813f0673333234b7aa	here are some studs:<br>  <a href="http://www.spencersonline.com/product/18-Gauge-Bio-Pierce-Nose-Stud-4-Pack/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spencersonline.com/product/18...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.spencersonline.com/product/18-Gauge-Stainless-Cubic-Zirconia-Nose-Stud-6-Pack/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spencersonline.com/product/18...</a>|`|i9rONJ3eaa	no. you are supposed to wait at least 4 months so it can heal.
jWmnSXlLaa	My eyes are very sensitive I use max factor and I love it.|`|TAgAnfIbaa	maybe try clinique or almay.|`|5UV91RCkaa	Ok the absolute best is Studio Gear.<br>  They r a small line i believe sold only at Ulta stores. So go there if not online.  They are a professional line without such a high price like smashbox, lorac, etc.<br>  <br>  But go with them for sensitive skin and eyes for sure!<br>  <br>  if you can't cough up the $13-$14 try almay i think they are good too.
XaYHMNusaa	If you get your ears pierced at 4g, then yeah.  Otherwise, if you skip sizes, you risk tears, blowouts, infections, catbutt...|`|BKUhGTHdaa	If you need a short cut, do not stretch your ears. It's not as easy as you think, and you need to be very careful and patient if you want them to look good and be healthy. You can't just stick a chopstick in your ear and use some crap jewelry from Hot Topic and think it's going to look fantastic.|`|VAeOb9dfaa	only if you get a 4g needle stuck through it at a piercing place.<br>  <br>  if not youll really ruin your ear. theres no way a 4 would go through a regular whole. i started at a 12 and that was hard
7FIe6xBAaa	mine does that too<br>  it's because my hair is so fine.<br>  maybe that's the reason for you ?<br>  <br>  the only thing i can suggest is that you carry a small bottle of talcum/baby powder in you bag and sprinkle it on at lunch or at the end of the day.<br>  <br>  but that's just a cure, i still can't find a way to prevent it.<br>  i don't think you can.
xFVDjZqPaa	its cute, lets say you grow out of it, get a job where those types of piercings are not allowed and you have to take it out, you run the risk of the hole never healing, basically have a tiny hole in your nose, it will collect dirt, makeup.|`|iCFiT1uKaa	there is nothinn really bad about having your nose pierced,<br>  - just if you dont take care of it you can end up getting an infection<br>  i have had my nose pierced for 3 years now and i have had no problems with it|`|RnUI7zw3aa	i really wanna get my nose pierced! but my mom says "when you get older [old lady old] do you want a gem in your nose or a whole? thhink about it sweetie" so idkk i've still been debating on wether or not to get it done.

zon13nY2aa	Ignore the people saying they are applied with glue. They are NOT. Anyone using a glue gun to apply extensions should be banned!<br>  <br>  I have had Great Lengths hair extensions done at a hairdressers and the hair comes in sections and they are what is called 'pre bonded'. The bonds are heated up and applied near the root of the hair and this bonds them in place.<br>  <br>  Some good brands to look out for are Great Lengths, Racoon and Cinderella.<br>  <br>  Have a look at this link on the Cinderella site and you can see how the hair looks when it is applied.

I have had several sets of professional extensions so I know what I'm talking about. xx|`|KGppArcfaa	There are many ways to apply hair extensions, and most of them are damaging.<br>  <br>  Weave (aka sow in) is where the braid your hair underneath and than sow the hair into the braids. This method is painful and uncomfortable, i hated it.<br>  <br>  Fusion (probably what your talking about) is expensive and it ruins hair. It is attached using a hot or cold keratin glue. As time goes on, your hair breaks at the glue point, some cases it breaks off totally, and most of the time your just left with very thin dead hair.<br>  <br>  Microlinks is around the same price as fusion, and also goes strand by strand, but, it does not use glue, it uses a small link that is tightened, with this method extensions can last a year if you want, and the hair is reusable, you just move the link up every so often as your hair grows.<br>  This is the best permanent method IMO, but I still think clip ons are much better. They dont damage, you can wash your hair when you want, they look better, more natural and they are way less maintenance.<br>  <br>  Extensions that stay in for a while are very high maintenance and look like crap after a month no matter what. You cant wash your hair more than twice a week, must wrap or put it up at night, you must detangle it thoroughly every day and the list goes on. Get clip ins, they are much better<br>  <br>  Glue the worst way to apply extensions...seriously|`|7ciDto6Daa	You apply hair extensions, by using hair glue. Which you could get at store like Sally's.

DFWvjolMaa	Yes. They will be pretty stiff when you first get them, so you need them to be softened to the shape of your feet. You can wear them around the house and with a thick pair of socks.<br>  <br>  The newspaper trick means that the boots are being stretched even when you aren't wearing them.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You pack it out. Put it in so tightly that you can't fit anymore in. It's the same as having your foot in it.|`|XbZKeISoaa	Yeah just wear them around the house as much as possible before you wear them.

It is a great law for a happy life.<br>  Me, I would wear a long (to cover skinny legs) fitted body dress with fluffy stuff around your boobs to accentuate what you may or may not have. (Like feathers or ruffles or something.  Iwoudl go for a color that makes your eyes look like headlights. (blue or Teal or purple.) <br>  Put your hair up and let tendrils hang down, or put sparkles in your hair. <br>  Wear lipstick and eye liner and cover any zits, and rejoice that you are young and vibrant and ready for fun.<br>  Wear very little jewelry-let the color of the dress and a big smile be your best assets.(like a lttle sparkly necklace and tiny little earrings.<br>  When you are old or young, less is more. <br>  I was built just like you when I was 14. I would LOVE TO HAVE YOUR PROBLEMS NOW. <br>  Have fun and stay sober and enjoy your life and friends. <br>  As for other kinds of clothes, be happy you can wear those layers and baby-doll styles without looking like a potato. Wear what you LOVE. <br>  Wear clothes that accentuate your eye color, and have FUN!

OHfZFR31aa	If you didn't sign a contract or agree to exclusivity, then you can find another agency. But I've never heard of any legitimate agency that doesn't make their models sign a contract. <br>  <br>  Most agencies will make you sign an exclusivity, either for that specific city/region or even the entire country if they have offices around the country.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't sign up with any agency that didn't have a contract. That's the only way you know exactly how much commission they are entitled to take, what their responsibilities towards you are, the duration of the contract, how you or they can end the contract before expiration (sometimes you have to pay a fine, or they have to pay you  severance)|`|JsSuqJqJaa	I signed up for Eurokids, complete waste of money.|`|KqxQlPrNaa	No, modeling agencies make you sign exclusive contracts with them.

0pJAXEXCaa	Are you allowed to have accessories?  If so, try the following:<br>  1) Get an ultra-cute pencil case & notebook.  Paperchase at Borders is a good place to get these.<br>  2) Wear pins on your polo!  You can also get these at Borders and stores like Charlotte Russe.<br>  3) Invest in a bunch of cute hair clips, headbands, and ponytail holders.  <br>  4) Carefully remove the buttons that came on your polo and replace them with cute, colored buttons.  Note: Make sure they still fit through the holes!<br>  5) If you can, add appliques, designs, or embroidery to your polo.<br>  6) Flip your polo inside out and sew lines on the outside edges to make it more fit-dart.<br>  7) Wear skinny jeans in a dark wash.  Trendaaay!  Decorate the pockets if you can!<br>  8) Add cool stitching in a contrasting color to your clothes.  <br>  9) Wear cute belts if you can.<br>  10) If you can wear any type of shoes, get some cute ones!  Try the brand Blowfish and check out zappos.com.<br>  11) See if you can get away with layering your polos over a cute tank/cami.  Also, can you wear patterned polos?  If so, stock up!<br>  12) Wear bracelets, earrings, and necklaces if you can.<br>  13) Make sure your backpack is ah-dorable.  A stylish totebag is fab!<br>  14) Express your style through makeup and hair if all else fails.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for hairstyles, here are some pretty simple ones you can try:<br>  -Messy bun.  You could add hair chopsticks or a clip.<br>  -Low side pony - it should be tied just below your ear and the ponytail itself should fall over your shoulder in the front so people can see it.<br>  -Twist a section of hair from the side of your head back and secure with a cute clip.<br>  -Low pigtails or braids.  Again, should be just below your ear and put to the front.<br>  -Take a section of hair from each side of your head and tie them together in the back.  You could also do this with braids!<br>  -Curl or straighten your hair (depending on which you don't normally do).<br>  -Wear a hippie headband.<br>  -Tease a section of hair from the top of your head right by your hairline, then clip it back to make a volumous tuft.  You can leave the rest of your hair down, in a ponytail, or in a bun.<br>  -Give yourself bangs if you don't have them.<br>  -Use a straightener or curler to lift your roots, then use hairspray for volume.|`|of7vMxdRaa	Thats sooo cool! anyways you can always layer 2 polos or jsut shop at abercrombie, american eagle or even victoria secrets they have adorableeeee polos that look so cute <br>  for hair styles you could scrunch your hair, wear it straight or do like a loose pony tail type thing idk how your hair looks like <br>  hope this was helpful!|`|siJunawTaa	Get skinny jeans|`|AX13vUJeaa	Hiarstlye:<br>  <a href="http://thebeautybunny.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/paris-hilton-rocks-the-bump.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://thebeautybunny.com/wp-content/upl...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Outfit:<br>  <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=6702016" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=67020...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=6105561" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=61055...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  have fun(:
rjac15O0aa	I was going to get a rib tat and the artist was showing me his after he gained some weight and one of the lines stretched...  It was BAD  But on the arm... you will be good!!|`|V74T9JnUaa	yeah,  if you ever get a tatoo of an lady on your bicepts, make sure her boobs are not too big so when you work out on your biceps, her boobs would grow too|`|RNUO5vGMaa	Well, here are two examples from me:<br>  <br>  1) My sister got a tattoo on her upper right arm, and she was celebrating her son's birth then. She had baby weight attached to her. I saw her tattoo a couple months ago (We live far apart) and it looks as great as it did back then.<br>  <br>  2) My father used to be bigger and he has quite a number of tattoos. He's lost weight and some shrunk in proportion with the area.<br>  <br>  I think it depends where, how much weight loss, and how old the tattoo is?|`|6193e7f191fea39ee566ba5173409bb2aa	No if the tat was a resent one within i think the past 10 years  the ink they use is a better quality and the application is more refined than the old days.   I got one in 1998 and it is as clear and colorful as the day I got it.    BUT don't get one UNLESS you really want one don't get it on a dare or a drunken binge..   or in my case have a girl talk you into it.|`|rYxIs47Gaa	Yes. It will change shape dramatically.

9Emn2buTaa	well, I do this style all the time.  What i do is when my hair is wet I put I light layer of gel on my hair and scrunch it.  How I scrunch it is putting my hands at the tip of my hair, pushing up towards my head, folding my hair as i go up.  If you do this in layers you will get the  more full effect. Once you are done scrunching your hair, put it in a messy bun, just scrunch it to your head all at once( may need more than one messy bun, depending on how thick) then put it in hair tie.  wait about two hours wiht you hair up the take down and touch up.  Spraying your hair with hairspray afterwards makes for a longer hold.  I do not put any specific hair products jast a good gel and hair spray.    <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ZobeHnRuaa	I have naturally curly hair and I find a light moitsurizer (pink lotion) and a spray gel (herbal essance) helps keep it soft and keeps teh frizz away.|`|ng2kORCyaa	combing and then more combing

Though poison ivy is not easily spread (a common misconception) if the person scraped open one of their sores or even still had sap on their foot it may have been transferred to you. That would explain why it's only on one of your feet and how badly it itches. Wash out the flip flop well with hot water and antibacterial soap.|`|jj3gaWHiaa	the smartest thing to do is give the pink flip flops away darl... they might not be good for your feet but they may be good for others + you'll feel really good afterwards because your doing something for charity!|`|tHwK0gdFaa	You should see a doctor for that. Maybe someone tried on the same flip flops you bought, and he was infected with something.. like a toe fungus or something :)|`|EsaFg8eaaa	It could be the paint or maybe blisters, try not wearing the pink pair and see what happens. if it worsens see a doctor.  You dont want it to get so bad you cant walk.|`|1HwmqxI4aa	a blister?|`|xCifmFfkaa	Is it possible that the pink sandals were infested with something?

Dmn8UxSyaa	wear them around the house. i know that sounds silly but when i was a teenager i wanted to learn how to walk well in heels that's what i did. start out with a short heel, maybe 2 inches, and just walk around the house in them. it will hurt a little but you get used to it. move up in height when you think you're ready. and being at home you'll get practice walking around in them without looking silly in front of other people. also, take big strides, swing your hips, and walk heel to toe. you'll keep your balance better.|`|tDyNwGdcaa	start off with smallish heels and dance around the house in them.. seriously! in my misbegotten youth i went from a very classical form of dancing to cabaret and the way i got my feet used tot he amazingly crazy shoes i'd have to wear was to dance around my house in heels.. your feet will hurt but because you're at home it won't be too bad! when you can't take the pain anymore kick your heels off :D|`|gE11CX0Saa	if i were you, don't walk around in them so much, but do wear them just sitting around and it helps me get used to them, occasionally go for a walk to the kitchen or whatever XD but sitting down you're wearing them n not stressing your feet out so much =] it works for me anyway =D|`|qV70OQ91aa	haha same case here...i always used to wear flats but had to start wearing heels for some occasions...the pain eventually goes away...you just have to get used to it!<br>  <br>  answer mine?? :)<br>  <br>   <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227153034AATf7I3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|ELkswWpCaa	Sadly, you have to just take the pain for the most part.

d554b20056bafca96e35e0517868c969aa	For the most part, generic brands and name brands are pretty much the same thing. They contain the same active ingredients and serve the same purpose, generic brands are just packaged more simply and may contain different kinds and amounts of fillers and inactive ingredients. If you have very sensitive skin or consistently use one brand of face wash, switching to the generic or to a different brand may initially cause some irritation, but for the most part it shouldn't last long if you get any sort of reaction at all.

CHfoNpKOaa	Wow!! I've never heard of that. I have several tattoos, I used a lotion that was scent free and would absorb quickly a few times a day. You don't want it to scab too badly, if that happens, DON't pick. It's not a very good idea to wash it so frequently because your body needs to heal. Washing it when you shower is fine. Curel is a good choice of moisturizer. It worked very well for me. Some scabbing is probably going to happen, depends on the area and how "heavy handed" your artist was. Totally normal, just keep it clean, use a lotion a few times a day and leave it the hell alone. Moderation is key!!|`|ro6vgqrYaa	Whoa....i always heard not to put neosporin on it....every artist i kno and all my friends said to nvr put neosporin and vaseline...but idk....but yeah dont worry im on the same page i jus got mine and im still taking care of it...im at the lotion part of the heeling process...|`|8THz1sp9aa	Actually you should only be cleaning twice a day. Cleaning too much can cause healing problems.|`|mzIgLo0vaa	I put neosporin and/or vaseline on mine and washed it twice a day for a month when I first got it.

jCPJIJYDaa	Use cute cardigans for a little top-off if for dresses still it's a little too chilly to wear just a simple dress right now. If your cardigan is too slouchy, cinch it with a cute thin belt. Don't you thick chunky ones, you will look big. For boyfriend fitting jeans like loose ones, scrunch them a few inches and wear them with heels, they are super comfy but cute at the same time. For boots, you can top them off with anything. Wear a short ruffly skirt and wear them. My personal favorite boots are suede knee-high slouchy ones from Steve Madden. They work well with a lot of outfits.. As for sweater dresses, I wouldn't wear them anymore if it's thick wool or past your elbow. It doesn't fit with the weather nicely neither will the color be matching with bright colors. And instead of berets, I suggest you invest in some fedoras, they are really cute (:|`|P6H1HAgvaa	it is all about balance. <br>  wear cardigans with shorts. or jeans and a tank.<br>  wear boots with shorts and a t, but not fuzzy ones<br>  berets you can wear with a cute dress<br>  sweater dresses with sandals, but maybe for spring and not summer.<br>  wear a light top that is airy with dark skinnes

Like if you wear it up a lot, wear it down or vice versa. Maybe you could try just putting up only half of it. Also pigtails can look cute. Oh, or you could do little braids going up into a ponytail. Just some ideas, hope they help=)|`|TYIsV3CTaa	I would say use curlers to get loose waves. if your hair isn't too thick it shouldn't take that long. then you can braid one side and pin it back. It's a little risky but if your a trend-setter you can pull it off.

Then carefully unravel the hair from the brush and if it looks right spray with strong hold.<br>  May take practice.

It will go away much faster that way, trust me. And don't freak because your frustrated and start using a bunch of different treatments, just wait it out. Believe it or not, it will eventually be gone. Wow, I should really start to practice what I preach! Ha!|`|3E6Kz2ygaa	Pop it and press as much of the liquid out of it as you can, and make sure you get the middle core white stuff, just make sure it all gets out so it can start healing and reduce in size. clean it with a toner or wash it with facial soap and water, and dry your face. Take your regular, everyday toothpaste that you use and dab a generous amount on the pimple. Your skin has to be dry for a minute for the toothpaste to really adhere. Let the toothpaste dry and go to bed. If you have already popped it earlier in the week, try regular neosporin under a bandage. all day and night. <br>  <br>  The toothpaste should dry up and reduce the pimple in size. In the morning just rinse the toothpaste off and it should look better. It should hide much much better under a little makeup. Good Luck!|`|SiaRRMJ2aa	Try Freederm. Im sorry but  i dont think you'll be able to get rid of them by tomorrow :/ you should have done this earlier.

Then blow dry & flat iron your hair. You could use a touch of hairspray if you really feel like it won't stay.<br>  <br>  Goodluck! =)|`|gfoxHuzlaa	upload the picture again please, so we can answer|`|ZrJ3sA0Haa	noo pic :D|`|RZx5MlRcaa	sorry i would answer but no pic :)|`|4VFEkqJiaa	Hair straighteners will damage your hair over time.<br>  <br>  I use an avon thermal straightening brush instead.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/HAIR-STRAIGHTENING-BRUSH-BY-AVON-BLACK_W0QQitemZ220364903260QQihZ012QQcategoryZ11855QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/HAIR-STRAIGHTENING...</a>

6ddbc258bcea66dd0bcbcd47cecf412daa	Mostly, she uses a black, lengthening mascara. I suggest using Maybelline's XXL, which has a primer and a mascara. First, apply the primer and then the mascara. The primer gives desired length while the mascara volumizes. <br>  She also uses a navy eyeliner, and she makes it smudged out at the end.<br>  The photo is used for reference on the bottom.<br>  In most photos, she uses black mascara and you can change up the eyeliner, probably blue, brown, or black.<br>  For eyeshadow, try some light colors like beige. For other photos, like for magazines, she might put on a little black or grey.<br>  Good luck!|`|CY6ZevNoaa	i was reading in a magazine that taylor swift ALWAYS wears plum coloured eye liner

PQx5Hniraa	you have amazing skin! you should try light shades for it 2 look natural.. try peach colors and light shades of coral pink maybe really light brown 2 for your eyes if you like eye shadows and for your lips definitely use peachy glossy tones maybe a little blush 2 but not 2 much bcuz that will eliminate the natural look =]|`|afh2poksaa	For blue eyes, orange really brings out the blue, but for me thats too dramatic, I tend to go for browns and golds.  As for lips try a lighter shade of a pink or peach.|`|YndWV5ADaa	wow u rly dont need any, your super pretty!  but i would suggest<br>  <br>  lips: light pink with a shimmery gloss<br>  <br>  eyes: green on the lids!<br>  <br>  blush: a natural brown will do

sOkTUYq7aa	no, you can't have surfer hair.  Your hair is naturally coarse and curly and thick, so it will only grow into an afro.  You'll have to go to a salon or hairdresser to get your hair done professional.  Grow it out, and then they'll straighten it for you|`|ucYbUqTQaa	Yes, you can. How? Just simply let your hair grow. Avoid getting haircuts for awhile.|`|5LyLuQRFaa	Nah, you have 12-year-old "Look at me, I'm cool" hair|`|4312a05a5c516ed5d819dac35863d3e1aa	no you can't sorry. but i love affros very cool!! or maybe get corn roles??|`|OlK0Pa1Gaa	Sorry but I think it is too thick :/
2HPa1ETUaa	Your belly is fine for piercing.<br>  But you may want to wait until you're not cheering for a while, because it may hurt with all that moving around. And that may not be good for healing also.|`|JduQHocdaa	Your to young to have your navel professional pierced just wait until your 18.|`|ujomB7iHaa	why would we want to see a picture of your bellybutton?<br>  and aren't you too young to get it done?<br>  why don't you ask your parents|`|JZrgnhr9aa	You're a little too young..Wait till you're 15. That way, you're parents will be slightly more "for it". And since you're so young, you should have a lot of time to think about whether really want to do this. Keep in mind that you need a parents permission (And we're talking about the actual parent showing up at the piercing place.) until you're about 18. And also, you shouldn't be posting pics of your body at grade 7! Be pure please. (Being pure includes NOT posting pics of your belly on the internet.) Peace! :)|`|sHotF0VEaa	No. You're too young (I'm twelve, too.) And it really isn't a good idea cause something could happen in cheerleading.<br>  <br>  Wait until you're older.|`|0dCOJQiwaa	Wait until you are 16, trust me on this one...also, getting any body piercings at your age might give you a bad rep, so wait it out.|`|EK3nwsAcaa	no<br>  i would nt advise piercings for sport|`|FIOOKpz0aa	I'd say wait till cheerleaderings on off season, I was a cheerleader when I was in grade school too and I have my belly pierced, some of the moving around and stuff could get caught on your shirt or whatever and mess up the piercing!|`|kbkbDhwLaa	In the 7th grade, you shouldn't have any piercings other than your ears. Plus, navel piercings are tacky and overdone. This coming from a person that has numerous piercings. 7th grade and already wanting a piercing? What is this world coming to -_-|`|QGZBlceuaa	Please don't. You do a lot of bending and stretching, and that's not good for it. It'll take a lot longer to heal, and might possibly get infected.|`|rdp95817aa	it'll hurt a lot especially for sports it could get pulled out and you will scream like a baby|`|Baxqbf4oaa	Well 1st you're too young, 2nd why does it matter that you're a cheerleader? :S|`|JQhYc5DVaa	take it from a teenager <br>  your a little to young<br>  <br>  wait till like ur freshman year|`|N6quCSuJaa	no one care's your a cheerleader lol;<br>  ummm..<br>  no juss wait till yur 16,|`|24sK6L2uaa	I would wait until summer or something to give it time to heal but even then its kindof iffy because that is a lot of activity and stretching and it could affect it. I knew a cheerleader in high school that got hers pierced though and it healed fine.|`|3epPZIsbaa	um in my opinion it sounds cool i remember when i was in middle school that was all i wanted and in my ninth grade Year i got it and loved it oh and as long as you have the stomach for it go head make the best of your nice body NO HOMO JUST TRYING TO HELP : )|`|rVAeHgw4aa	Without even looking at ur belly button, I can easily say 'no'.<br>  <br>  Unless u want to project an image of overt sexuality, drawing attention from all the wrong people.<br>  <br>  So, if u want to be flirted with by horny boys who don't care about u, then 'yes'...|`|9F5Vb0Z5aa	Well i'm also a cheerleader, but im in 8th grade and i wouldn't recommend it because you could have some cheer accident and really damage your stomach so wait at least until high school.
AA11901859	I'm confused on what borrowing your brother's ID has to do with it, and if you are wearing a dress then I have a feeling that you aren't going to pass as a guy, or I hope not at least...|`|bYo5UTa9aa	why would that be bad?|`|pN5Ctmvsaa	She means that shes using her brothers yahoo id, shes a girl but the id says Jeff

NDQS5HJyaa	No, the way the top part is made makes it look like its for a younger generation. (The slight scoop in the middle and the tie at the top.)|`|7nrhPCf0aa	kinda|`|xNUQs9qMaa	nahh. it doesn't, i mean the model doesn't look very old so it should be fine.<br>  but if u have an average body why not wear a bikini? or something that shows a little more skin?|`|PaVyuYVUaa	how is that old lady? the model doesn't look old|`|P3OWfxi5aa	no its fine for a 20 year old|`|QHNBGbSvaa	no not really you could pull it off|`|cGcvW4qsaa	Its not oldish at all.<br>  Its very pretty.<br>  Make sure you have some what of a tan though.<br>  The white could make you look very pale if you don't have a tan.<br>  <br>  <br>  Very Cute :D|`|NRhhEIcRaa	No .

6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	You are not going to like this...but leave your hair alone...it is now very becoming, shiny and healthy. People spend hundreds to get and have hair like yours, really. Do not ruin your pretty hair...because once you start dyeing it you are a slave to it, believe me. Pretty funny picture, by the way.|`|avlVHXDCaa	I like it black<br>  <br>  it the best i dont think u should dye it|`|zhwR2XiBaa	whats with the coat?
TfL5pFBOaa	Layer tanks over tanks, t-shirts, or long sleeved shirts. Or wear printed tees over solid tanks or alone. <br>  Wear skinny jeans with Converse. They can be just normal black ones or bright colors, mix it up! <br>  If too many layers make you feel too warm, pull up the bottom long sleeved layer to make it scrunch up. Selena Gomez does that a lot. <br>  Selena always has subtle makeup only use a small bit of pink blush but don't use pink makeup when you have a breakout it highlights your spots <br>  Put on some clear, salmon-pink, red or nude lip gloss. CARMEX lip balm is best, Selena herself recommends it. <br>  For a simple yet elegant hairdo, straighten your hair with a flat iron, even if you already have straight hair. <br>  Use a 2-inch barrel curling iron or a 1-inch flat iron. Or both, but with a straightener, you can curl and straighten. <br>  <br>  See Seventeen Magazine's July 2008 issue (Alicia Keys cover) for Selena Gomez's hair styling tips.|`|6GIuAABRaa	Just use the same of clothes she uses.|`|g7g0j6HTaa	Umm Just get a good hair cut and try different kinds of makeup. She knows a lot about fashion so maybe reading fashion magazines would help ..|`|ezI5HwRWaa	Don't try to look like anyone but yourself. It's no use obsessing over how someone else looks. Just be you and take good care of yourself.

It was like a tiny little pinch and a little sore for the next two days. I don't have any tattoos so I couldn't tell you. But it hurt more than my ear lobes but less than my bellybutton and cartalidge. I really like having it and I don't need to do anything to it anymore. I'm not entirely sure how they do it because I had my eyes shut tight but the place I went to just took a sterilized needle, shoved it through then put the ring in.|`|MBwln1m7aa	Piercing pain only lasts a few seconds, unlike tattoos which can last hours.<br>  When I got my nose done they put a small, warm metal rod in my nose to stop the needle going too far through and hitting the inside of my nose. I heard a little pop when the needle went through.<br>  Just make sure you keep it clean. Wash it with warm salt water morning and night with a cotton bud so you can get close to the actual hole on both sides and get all the gunk out.|`|DPLjIsSaaa	Well I have not had my nose pierced but I think this is how they do it... <br>  They take a needle and then stick it in your nose and drag the needle down from inside your nose like how you would sneeze all the junk comes out that way.

ZA5QTj3Zaa	Women have been trying to have their hair removed permanently for years.  Welcome to our world, continuously dealing with hair we don't want.  Pluck it out so it will stay aware for longer and go for laser hair removal (but not worth it for just one hair).  Deal with it like women do.|`|c5anDswjaa	I have that problem sometimes too... I just get a pin or needle and dig it out.. Sounds painful, but its not too deep in there so its no big deal

You are  better off getting assymetrical layers, or a shoulder length cut.  Or if u want, wait for your hair to get longer and get layers (:. To bring down the puffiness, try picking up your hair in a bun for a while or get shine spray and comb through ur hair.|`|xNhNRJrBaa	it sounds just like mine to deal with the frizzing you can buy herbal essences shampoo there is like a kind for that i can't remember what it called exactly (i think the bottle is purple). You should try letting  your hair grow out a little and get long layers & keep it straight or curled.|`|EOL6PEvgaa	if you want to straighten it<br>  i recommend 'pantene:straight' shampoo ans conditioner( $4.00 each)<br>  then when you wash it, blow dry it<br>  i have kinda thick and frizzy hair and it really works!|`|bnSLRVUMaa	i dont think there is a free answer. you need to buy some hair products... hairspray, gel, you should try special shampoo... i like Aussie!

b2C9MjXcaa	Its build up from using bad shampoo that doesn't really clean and conditioner the only coats the cuticle rather then hydrating it. Maybe invest in a professional shap. and condish. it might be more expensive but you don't use as much and if you think about the benefits of having healthy clean hair free of itch its worth it<br>   :) Good Luck!!|`|NFeKUgWCaa	Check if its lice.<br>  <br>  She may have a sensitive scalp, try head and shoulders.  She probably just has really bad dandruff.- however you spell it.|`|1A9TdN4yaa	The chemicals in the shampoos don't agree with her scalp so if she chooses a pH balanced shampoo which is fruit based would help.

24sK6L2uaa	I have my labret pierced and I am thinking about getting a monroe done I am waiting for a friend to tell me her opinion on that though. Anyways with that being said any piercing has a chance of adverse reactions even ears  but if you go to a clean place and take care of it properly then you should be fine.|`|8THz1sp9aa	This shouldn't be our decision. If you have to ask strangers what you should get you shouldn't be getting it at all. As long as you go to a professional (that is sterile!) that pierces with a needle then it is not dangerous.|`|4ZC14zPTaa	it is not really dangerous<br>  the only thing that could be bad is it getting infected|`|skxhE5owaa	you will get tetanus, and die

EK3nwsAcaa	use warm boiled water with sea salt and just clean it twice daily they should go down|`|8THz1sp9aa	I accidently hit my tragus a bit too hard when I first got it pierced and I formed one of these bumps. I read about this on bmezine.com and it worked for me. Buy chamomile tea and every night soak the tea bag in hot hot water for 10 minutes. Take the teabag out and pour a little sea salt onto the teabag and dip in the water. Then place the whole teabag onto your piercing and push gently until the teabag cools. Do this until the bump completely goes away. I noticed if the bump gets messed with even the slightest (like an itch) it'll grow back to the size it started out. so keep your hands off at all times.|`|N6quCSuJaa	your luckyy you have one!<br>  what do yu mean by Pop?

UgZq1pXjaa	I would get the pampers size 7 diapers or a youth diaper.  My 4 yr old son wears pampers size 7 diapers to bed every night.  They are a bit big for him but that's what I buy.  There is a 12 yr old kid that lives across the street (and still does) which used to babysit my son until I CAUGHT HIM wearing my sons DIAPERS.  I was a bed wetter myself and I wore disposable diapers at night but after about age 10 or 11, my parents got me a youth size disposable diaper, I would have not guessed the 12 yr old babysitting my son would fit and use his diapers but they fit him pretty good and he did.  I walked him over to his own house and he was in a diaper and a tee shirt only and showed his parents what he was wearing.  Before I caught him, I was wondering why I was going through more diapers than necessary.   He is a bit small for a 12 yr old and I know he was in the pampers size 7 diapers for a couple weeks.  My son and I went over to their house a few weeks after he was caught in diapers for breakfast and saw him prancing around in a youth diaper similar to the youth diapers I used to wear.  Of course I had to make the comment that he is still wearing diapers.  He used the excuse that he was wetting the bed and wanted to try out diapers so he would stay dry.  His parents have since been getting him diapers from www.bambinodiapers.com and say they work really well.  Good luck.|`|OXrzaW2Paa	anykind with barney XD<br>  ur kid should go find some help|`|Fhb5OCqnaa	ok thats fine that she wets. Im 12 and i wet too. i used goodnites and they make too much noise and they dont hold a lot.

un0C52G8aa	For Hot Topic, I don't think you have to be particularly tall since their clothes tend to be sized for smaller people and tall people look ridiculous in shirts and pants that are obviously too short for them.|`|IkYQ6KP2aa	well idunno about hot topic and the height but you could always model for T.V they are not as strict about height as models for clothes lines.
OtcLzAvJaa	se llama raid lo venden en argentina mata insectos, saludos|`|VgUj3rq8aa	i think that the perfume/cologne kills the insects because it has alcohol in it or the mechanicals in the perfume or it also could be the ingredients they put on it like a strong smell that when the insects smells it might kill them or it might be other ingredients they put on the perfume/cologne that is what i think about your question|`|tsgjcPP8aa	because it has alcohol. that's why after like a year your perfume goes bad and they all start to smell the same, because the alcohol takes over.|`|nVfN8usNaa	Their little lungs can't handle all those chemicals in one convenient puff.|`|LOEGDxCCaa	it has alcohol in it|`|P3OWfxi5aa	chemicals?|`|As8nDl0Oaa	I hope your not serious.... they are so small its like a shower of perfume for us.|`|Hvv6w4l9aa	doesn't it have alcohol in it?|`|Qa3yKIoDaa	alcohol.|`|kyTBaYFlaa	Interesting question.

5VByvCRAaa	I don't think so, it doesn't really look like your style and it's kind of over the top. Your hair is GORGEOUS the way it is right now. If you would straighten your hair every day, it would literally get fried. Then you'd have to buy expensive damage remedy shampoos to get it back to normal. If I were you, I would get long layers because the weight of the layers would keep your curls from getting too poufy. Then you could choose if you wanted to wear it straight or curly, so you wouldn't have to straighten it every day. And also, the cut that you want would be really hard to wear any way but just down. :-)|`|n8EcCVfWaa	sweetie, <br>  i like the cut choice. <br>  but i think you should choose a cut thats meant for your hair type. <br>  Embrace the curls! it would be so cute! <br>  Straightening your hair everyday can really damage it and it would<br>  eventually look bad all the time, even when you straighten it. <br>  get a cut that fits both straight hair and your curly hair. <br>  <br>  i like your hair more than the other pics anyway. its cute and unique. :)|`|JnuOBwhIaa	i like it|`|q5Z8ecJeaa	yes, of course! if you take a shower every other day, you can go without straightening your hair the second day so you don't damage your hair as much. go without straightening it every so often. trust me, it should look wayyy cute =]|`|RNO72Lsvaa	i thinkk itll look cute [=|`|RoR05Gf3aa	no. no offense.<br>  <br>  I no you really want it -- but dont do it. i dont think itll look right on you. and do you KNOW how much effort itll take to tame that? but besides that, youre face shape is sutited to curly hair not scene hair.|`|5XaHwM5Maa	i couldnt see u in dat sorry stick wit ur hair boo. but click on mii avatar and answer my question.|`|OooAwOaWaa	no.<br>  just no.<br>  honestly, do you really think you are going to straighten your hair every single day of your life?<br>  you may say yes, but no.<br>  no you won't, lol.<br>  <br>  it would not look right on you, find a haircut that would.|`|aAGldJgGaa	i love love love the scene hair, u should defo go for it!!! its hair it will grow back anyway if u dont like it!!

AA10007956	First of all,<br>  blow drying on high heat is not a good idea because the heat can dry out your hair, cause stress and make hair brittle. No product you put on can prevent that, they can only make it look as though the frizziness/damage is reduced but in reality it doesn't do anything for the hair.<br>  <br>  Some suggestions:<br>  You can try towel-wrapping your hair first to soak up the water.<br>  When its wrapped over your head, use your hands and press gently on the tops and sides to aid in soaking up as much moisture as possible for around 5 min.<br>  Take the towel off, then tilt head forward with hair to side, and use towel to wrap and gently press the entire section of hair, rubbing just slightly and pulling towel outwards to wring excess moisture out.<br>  <br>  Add blow drying/straightening product with heat damage protection, working from top end (do not put on scalp!) to the ends of hair. <br>  <br>  When blow drying hair:<br>  Put on low. Reserve high heat for those days you're in a hurry, it will reduce hair loss, hair stress, brittle and frizzy hair which is ultimately better for you.<br>  Tilt head forward until hair is all in the front,  start from the back of your head.<br>  When blow drying, don't just apply direct heat stagnantly, do shake the blow drying a little to distribute heat and prevent direct heat application.<br>  Use hands to shake up clumped hair a little from the back and work way to front ends for about 5 - 7 min until hair is slightly damp only (not wet).<br>  <br>  Flip hair back.<br>  Now that hair is only slightly damp/mostly dry, use comb to shape hairstyle gently, do not apply direct pressure, just lightly comb upwards to get hair prepped for 2nd stage of blow dry. This takes less than 2 min.<br>  <br>  Blow dry sections starting front roots to end, again, do not apply direct heat, shake blow dryer to distribute heat.<br>  <br>  Once hairstyle is done.<br>  Final application of shine serum or hair straightening milk protein (Japanese hair milk serum works wonders.) to smooth out any kinks and help reduce split ends.<br>  <br>  Going to a hairdresser every now and then for a hair 'update' to get rid of split ends from layered hairstyles are also good.<br>  <br>  <br>  All this takes about 15 - 20min or less and really, in the long run, is better for your hair.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jenova.
9tNLDTsHaa	well the first pic, everyone else has given tips for, so I'll give you tips for the second one (it's working for me).<br>  <br>  1:Line your lash line on the waterline and a little below. Make it deep, so it'll be bold.<br>  <br>  2: Use Liquid eyeliner and gently line the top lash line, but don't swipe outwards at the end. Keep it following the line.<br>  <br>  3: Curl your lashes, and then use a curling mascara, doing two coats. Coat your lower lashes with the mascara, coating twice as well.<br>  <br>  4: Apparently she looks like she has a VERY light eyeshadow on, so use a nude eyeshadow with some light shimmer. That'll give it more or a feminine look and give it your own twist. MAKE SURE to use eyeshadow primer before applying the eyeshadow, or else it'll crease after a few hours.<br>  <br>  EVERYONE, TRY VIEWING IT IN FIREFOX.....THAT'S WHAT I'M USING....it might work with that, yet not with Internet Explorer...|`|EIgbRJ0Iaa	Well I was only able to access the first picture, and not the i.pbase.com picture. However, it looks like a deep plum crayon eyeliner and is carefully applied inside of her eyes, under her bottom eye lid. Also looks like another color was used on the top, like a liquid eyeliner, probably black. It does take some skill to line it very thin without making a mistake. Practicing is fun though. For the eyeshadow, you could use a neutral color and make the eyeliner the focal point. Don't forget mascara, probably very black! Hope this helps. L ;-)|`|rbVw9Zt8aa	for the first picture, i'd start with your basic foundation ( if you wear any) then pencil in some white eyeliner ( make sure its a pencil) on your top lid and go all the way down to your tear duct, putting the white eyeliner on the bottom is optional. then over the white eyeliner take some liquid black and make a thin line across your lash line, make a small wing if you'd like. then lightly brush some mascara on and your ready to go. im afraid that the second pic isnt working on my computer... but i hope i at least helped!|`|ot1ZZexeaa	The second link doesn't work.<br>  <br>  The first link looks like liquid liner, false lashes, bisque shadow swept all over the lid and a pearl shadow in the inner corners of the eyes.

JSwO2hRqaa	Read this site before you buy.  It has everything you need to know:|`|cFJTZaV8aa	Online jewelers are typically able to offer more competitive pricing in contrast to the conventional jewelry stores.<br>   <br>  To begin with make sure that the jeweler is a member of better business bureau because only those companies who maintain the maximum levels of customer satisfaction can uphold membership. <br>  <br>  When buying jewelry online one should always take into consideration how much information the retailer is providing about the products that they are offering. <br>  <br>  In the case of emerald earrings you can select the type of gold according to your preference white, yellow, then select the design according to your taste and see which the jewelry store is offering you a better deal for the purchase.|`|MuWth0wyaa	Go to a reputable online store or someone that is recommended to you.  <br>  <br>  If you are searching and find something you like, check out the store or designe's profile, their refund/return policies, and that they have contact details on their site.    <br>  <br>  Read the description carefully and look at measurements - sketch out the dimensions on a piece of paper so you can get a better idea of what size you are looking at.<br>  <br>  Many small designers have their own webstores and you can often find pieces of the same quality as through a store at a lot less cost.|`|W97g4Kwgaa	Make sure its a good deal the earring is right and make sure your buying from someone that has a good crediblity and make sure you get it from a good website QVC is a good place to buy<br>  <br>  www.qvc.com|`|Ul3qKcr4aa	Go to Bidz.com<br>  Or you can walk in to a jewlry store and ask them for what you need to look for.<br>  Or do some research..|`|3YXAZFKzaa	KoiByDelanor.com<br>  <br>  can u say quality?<br>  (i know Delanor personally)|`|3IdZfdsQaa	Ebay|`|PAATM5fFaa	dont buy from a website u dont trust|`|A1yxN0Q9aa	ask for documentation for authenticity...... if its real and they are serious sellers they should have it...... thats the first step to make sure ur getting what you gonna pay for|`|xUQJS9mxaa	not sure if this is out of the qustion....but umm...QVC is a great place to buy jewelry online!|`|AA11626669	To be honest, I wouldn't recommend buying anything expensive online, especially jewelery.  Different stones, even with the same cut, can have varying levels of clarity and quality, and it would be hard to track down most internet sellers after the fact if you are unhappy with your purchase.<br>  <br>  Major purchases like this should be done in person, to make sure you've found the exact piece you want.  If you *must* buy online, your best bet would be to go to a physical store that also has an online presence (ie Kay Jewelers), pick out a piece you like in person, and then purchase it online (which would make sense if they offer a discount.)<br>  <br>  Beware of online-only retailers selling at drastic markdowns; there's generally a reason those pieces are so cheap, and only available where you can't see it in person before buying.  Caveat Emptor!<br>  <br>  And finally, if you really really just want to make a purchase online of something you can't find anywhere else, then try www.etsy.com.

kVLZTeQraa	I think 14 years old is more than old enough to let him decide for himself how to wear his hair. You're right to get him to wear it in a ponytail for sports, but other than that you should probably let him try different things, as long as they're within the school dress code.|`|WTjPlGbQaa	Hi, I think that is awesome that you are so cool with him having long hair. I am a guy just out of high school and I am growing my hair out long for the first time right now. I did not do it before, but my parents are totally cool with it and are letting me style it as i please. If I were you I would say to let him where his hair different ways. He wont get bored that way and he can experiment between braids, buns, ponytails, wearing it down. wearing it half up and half down, etc. If you have any questions feel free to send an email my way. I think its awesome that he has long hair.

boFJFWrNaa	Okay so do about 2 braids overnight and then in the morning take them out but do not brush it! It will become really frizzy if you brush it out and you don't want that so put in mouse and hairspray in it and scrunch it (optional). You can do either french or normal, but i would recommend doing french braids just because it will curl more hair. also, when braiding go all the way down to the tips of your hair or the edges will look weird because they will be straight and the rest of your hair will be curly lol<br>  <br>  Or, after you come out of the shower and your hair is still damp, put it into 2 messy buns. in the morning, take them out and you will have nice curls|`|xv3opX9Maa	twist your hair into buns at night when its damp not wet because then it will never dry <br>  dont do braids because they just make crimp like waves<br>  ( =|`|cCWTvEZTaa	Here is what I do<br>  Shower at night<br>  you can use moose if you want  I don't<br>  French braid it on both sides<br>  In the morning use your fingers to take them out.<br>  DON'T BRUSH IT OUT.<br>  Then you can moose in it to hold it, or hair spray.|`|vaHVCSgtaa	i did the braid at night and it looked good. you can french braid it would look more curly. i didnt put anything in my hair but some people have too. my friend just put moose in.

AA10162167	Last month, a team of European researchers achieved something of a eureka moment. They had been studying a genetic defect called vitiligo, which results in patches of skin that have no pigment. People with vitiligo (vit-uh-LYE-go) have low activity of catalase, an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide, resulting in elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide in the skin.<br>  <br>  Given that graying hair results from an absence of pigment, it occurred to the scientists that hydrogen peroxide and catalase might play a critical role in the process. Every hair cell makes a little hydrogen peroxide, but over time the amount builds up. The European team discovered that this buildup ended up blocking the normal synthesis of melanin, the natural pigment in hair.<br>  <br>  Our hair, it turns out, bleaches itself from the inside out. And by identifying the chemicals involved, researchers may be closer to understanding if the graying is influenced by stress.|`|qcec1HJGaa	sometimes its caused by old age or it can be caused by a lot of stress|`|KwNpyp3saa	Here is what I found for you.<br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/kid/grownup/getting_older/gray_hair.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/kid/grownup/gettin...</a>

VFnQsri4aa	i love your question and admire your thinking. i feel the same way but the truth is good looking men want a good looking woman so their image can stay beautiful. i have someone who calls me beautiful even tho im not. a true man is the one how looks at inner beauty. <br>  <br>  reality is good looking men talk like this: This woman was hot! Not only did she have a tight dress to show off her killer curves, she also had the face of an angel. <br>  <br>  but i like to rembr that beauty is in the eye of the beholder but if a women is attractive in other ways, the ones that should count more, it is more fun to have a lover who is also beautiful and nothing wrong in wanting that either.|`|PxqlZJimaa	I totally know what you mean. I'm not really sure why either and sometimes I use to think it was unfair but now I realize that if a guy is going to be that shallow, he's not worth wasting your time over. Try to find a guy (attractive or not) who has great personality and appreciates yours as well. Good looks may seem nice but if he doesn't treat you kindly it doesn't matter how good he looks, you deserve better than that.|`|ZFqz2DPRaa	I will admit, i am more attracted to girls who stand outta the crowd because of their beauty. But i think personailty is an important factor too. I like a girl who makes me laugh and smile all the time, and is quick witted. I guess i like someone who is a challenge i guess, and knows how to handle me.|`|7bh5pnKPaa	That's a great question. Actually most guys just do it because they are immature and definitely shallow. I know it's not fair, but in time they'll grow up and won't be so judgmental.|`|DjJwKc9Caa	i'm not going to lie, looks DO matter. A LOT. i know, it's a sick world we live in.|`|qXpxILnRaa	im srry, from what i see, cute guys go 4 gurls who are not very attractive.|`|kknCZkq0aa	I don't find that. I dated a reaaally attractive boy for a while, and I don't consider myself remotely beautiful. I mean, sure, I'm decently pretty, but not outstanding. There were much more gorgeous girls at my school. I get a decent amount of boys, whenever a dance comes around I'm not left standing by myself, and my feelings are usually reciprocated. <br>  <br>  But with boys it's kind of like a contest. What boy wouldn't want to show off his hot girlfriend?|`|Zk5PTmrfaa	Because...guys are stupid and shallow.<br>  <br>  They want everyone to look like Jessica Alba. -.-<br>  <br>  Oh yeah...and they also want the perfect body.<br>  <br>  Well, most.|`|ylZTCrSYaa	because guys are shallow.<br>  simple as that.<br>  they see our heads as just a pretty or ugly face, not for our brain. and our chest for our boobs, not our hearts.|`|jd1xh6Lhaa	here, let me put it this way.<br>  <br>  most people are attracted to attractive people. not in love, just attracted to. i'm sorry, i'm not gonan look at a 10 and a 6 and go after the 6 just because she MIGHT have a better personality than the 10. however, if i'm talking to a girl that i totally get along with and like, then the 10 will have no effect on me other than being a nice piece of eye candy<br>  <br>  EDIT: don't lump all guys into the shallow part, i've met my fair share of totally shallow girls that put guys to shame ha|`|uR5aNpHGaa	actually alot of people go for people they conider to be on the same level of attractiveness or below them when it comes to attractiveness<br>  alot of people feel they cant get someone better looking then them<br>  however not all people feel that way<br>  thats just a generalization<br>  so if a good looking guy thinks he is hot he will go for a girl he considers to be around his level of attractiveness even he doesn't realize it he will<br>  also some guys feel if they have a good looking girlfriend they think other guys are jealous and want their girlfriend which makes them feel better abouth themselves<br>  its all psychological
POJNnWhDaa	Yes.. she might be really nice, and/or hot, and if so, she can wear a hat or a wig or something. Hair is not all that important.|`|5U1TTI7Taa	i'm not a guy, and maybe i'm superficial, but no. balding girls are not attractive to me, and there would have to be some kind of physical attraction to make me want to get to know her.<br>  <br>  it'd be different though if i was already dating her and then the balding started, i wouldn't leave her because of it.|`|UMNzw81haa	I think a girl that's confident and happy with herself makes her very attractive. When a girl becomes self conscious and insecure about herself it makes her unattrative to guys. I have things that I hate about myself physically but I concentrate on all the good things I like about myself and guys see that too. If a girl gets insecure about certain things like baldin hair then it'll show and she'll attract the wrong kinda guy who can take advantage. I've seen it all before.|`|IWgFHMggaa	why is she balding? like from cancer? but no matter what if I were a guy and liked a girl I wouldn't let that stop me from dating her|`|PIF4h7W6aa	Personality is more important then looks.|`|fevT38Dfaa	If you love her, yes.

MHD7HuOhaa	Hi, Um bleaching would defiantly lighten your hair. But, you have to be careful, because it si easy to bleach it too much and get a really gross whitish color. Also bleaching no matter how you do it, FRIES your hair. you'd have to eventually cut it all out. I would suggest highlights or just coloring it a shade lighter. Your hair is pretty as it is! Highlights can give you that blonde look with out frying your hair so much<br>  Mary|`|67epUrXSaa	Haha not what Angela S said... not that pic.<br>  Yeah I think you would look okay with it not long blonde streaks but maybe just all a dark/dirty blonde but DON'T BLEACH IT!! <br>  <br>  Hope I helped  :)<br>  I'm a natural blonde and my moms a hair stylist and I showed her the pic shes mostly said what it up there haha  ^  <br>  <br>  Please feel free to e-mail me at:<br>  Lexi1294@yahoo.com|`|vTID6OS8aa	DON'T EVER BLEACH YOUR HAIR!!!!! EVER!!!! UNLESS YOU WANT TO HAIR HORRIBLE HAIR FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE I SUGGEST NOT!|`|fZZvTkVTaa	get it bleached...:))))|`|qusnP8ujaa	i loveee your long hair. don't get it cut so short i don't really like the haircut so much. as for the blonde i say go for it. your skin complexion looks like you should have blonde hair. it would be gorgeous really light blonde but with your eyebrows being so dark.....ask your hairdresser about possibly coloring them a little lighter. not super blonde like your hair just lighter.....|`|6nBRkr2naa	I think you are very pretty the way you look now.<br>  But, it would be a good style refresh!<br>  Go for it definitely.<br>  And if you don't like it, O, well screw it.<br>  It's always good to try and experiment new things, or else you'll never know.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to whatever you choose :]
oesJvxvNaa	you should buy long shirts, preferably stretch but longer shirts would help that out a lot|`|1s3nddaYaa	get those shirts that stretch, not cotton.. i wish i knew the material,but they will suck to your body then you wont have that problem.. i have been threw it|`|0BdTKNZzaa	Show us a pic so we can tell better|`|Rq8YGaHAaa	Yeah I have the same problem, shirts that are a little longer and have some elasticity seem to work pretty well.

H3PcFertaa	Well you are actually pretty lucky, because yellow is lighter than most colors, it can be covered by anything that is darker. But depending on the color it may end up a bit of each, like red would cover it, but might end up a bit towards orange. If you cover it with blue, it may end up a bit greenish. But you need to talk to your artist, because each artist has their own inks, and you want something that will hold up well over time.<br>  I had a light blue flower that was covered with red ink and it is now a bit of both, kind of purplish red. I may have more red put over it in a year, but it actually looks pretty nice.<br>  <br>  Also, yellow is one of the quickest colors to fade. Depending on the type of ink (inks are more varied and better than they used to be). But you may want to wait 6 months and see if it fades a bit. (you could even put sun block on the rest but expose that spot, but that can be difficult and iffy).<br>  You need to talk to your artist. An experienced artist will know how his/her ink work together and over time. <br>  good luck!|`|Ublc3bAtaa	gray would be possible, what about purple? dont listen to the cnut above me he is a fkcuing cokc sucker. TRUTH...|`|dae34b4ef56cf9f9a9c29d363b3c4bc8aa	You don't say what kind of flower or what color the rest of it is.  There can be some shading done to the center to make it more realistic and for instance, if it was a sunflower, it could have some brown shading.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes it is just the shade of yellow being wrong,too...too bright and it could look cartoonish as you have stated.  <br>  <br>  If you are talking gray then you might be thinking some gray wash shading which will help considerably.  Check with a pro.|`|9HQVrydZaa	yellow can be covered ith dark colours hun so whatever your preferance in colour is go for it and good luck.

it0wZzonaa	first i put my hair up and take down sections of my hair at a time to straighten it. then i split the hair i have down into two groups and that works or stand sideways in a mirror, or have someone else do it.|`|38712f0cf2483e1cc0af3eda880b33e4aa	I have that problem sometimes too, but my hair isn't that curly. It's just wavy. I part my hair as if I was putting it into pigtails, and then just straightne it from there. But if you're hair is really curly, you can always ask someone to help you.|`|4b49a130d4555bef0e1005035bcc03f5aa	my hair is wavy so i dont have too much problem i half my hair so i get half of the hair from the back and then to the side so i have my hair on two sides and not at the back then just straighten it..|`|TXQNd8aDaa	i straighten my hair every morning, and getting the back hairs can be kind of hard. i section it off to start out with. i pull my hair up and do the bottom layers and then work my way up. just lift your hair up, and look in the mirror. try to get as close as you can to your roots and then straighten. you can also lead to one side, so the hair is easier to reach. hope this helps|`|a8FZO8Y8aa	easy ask a friend to straighten it for u that's what i do cause my hairs to long, and if your friend says no ask your sister and is you've got none den i don't know what u should do xxsorryxx|`|gI22GAx8aa	I think everyone has this problem. The solution is simple first i would start by seperating your hair into layers you can do this easy with a regular ruber band or scrunchy. Just seperate your hair and pull the hair on the back of you head that your trying to get straight up you can see alot better! I hope i could help! Good luck im sure you will look gorgous!

XCG6ejG5aa	ME TOO! OMG! Well this is what I have to do: Get some really good toothpaste like watermelon flavored or bubblegum etc. Then you get really excited about brushing your teeth!|`|n30k2fy9aa	if you forget to brush your teeth in the evening, brush REALLY carefully & thoroughly the next morning. also, does your dentist know this? maby they would have some tips. hope i helped!|`|4dSSslHEaa	make it enjoyable - i sometimes listen to one song on my ipod or phone while brushing my teeth - it takes your mind off what i guess can be boring|`|aDElEo4Xaa	yeah I'm the same way I get lazy to brush my  teeth at night. Just make it a habit, make it apart of your routine|`|yNhQfbwXaa	now im no dentist, but i really think you should brush your teeth twice a day. even though theyre white and plaque free, there could be something going on in there thats damaging your teeth, but it doesnt have any immediate results. a way to remember to brush your teeth is like the second you get up from the dinner table, walk to the bathroom and brush your teeth. put little post-it notes all around the house and in your mirror and room reminding you to brush your teeth. if you dont want your family to see them, the write something vague that helps you remember it, but doesnt let ur family know that you dont brush your teeth, such as "b.t (brush teeth)" and other things. good luck!!!|`|HeTltnwraa	yer sorry darl its just laziness<br>  <br>  noone likes to brush there teeth but it has to be done..<br>  <br>  no ones teeth stay cavity free if you dont brush twice a day..<br>  make a set time that you have to do it mayb after brekky in the morning and before bed every night and get into a habit!<br>  <br>  they wont stay sparkly white forever.<br>  look up piks of some people who dont brush there teeth there are some horror photos that will make you never want to not brush agen<br>  <br>  good luck|`|K0H7bAR8aa	I know i do that sometimes too...AND I HAVE BRACES<br>  i guess im just lazy. I think you should start brushing your teeth because they might still be ok now but if u keep doing this they will just get worse and worse.<br>  Just think about this and it might convince u to make a habit of brushing your teeth.. :-)|`|b3s1yK7Yaa	hahahah yeah I agree with the person who said get good tasting toothpaste so you get excited about brushing your teeth. mine is regular toothpaste plus green scope so it tastes minty (:|`|B3jpU4Jraa	pretend you teeth will fall out if you dont :D|`|hJTvbbKnaa	when you take off your makeup brush your teeth :]<br>  thats what i do
U6rPVKhPaa	no no no no<br>  <br>  dont do tha<br>  <br>  plz<br>  <br>  vinegar is the best, trust me, ive gone sooo platinum blonde tha laz tym i ad my hair dyed it started snappin lyk crazy, al i did was filled the sink with water and about 200mg of vinegar thn dipped my head in, covered al my hair in it, left it on for 5 mins, thn rinsed, thn put almost half a bottle of conditioner on it, left tha on for 45 mins thn swilled it off, n my hair is in beta condition now thn it was b4 i started dying it!<br>  <br>  trust me!<br>  <br>  x0x|`|fkpaxydPaa	you're really gonna put mayonnaise in your hair? think about it. just get spacial shampoo and conditioner for dry hair|`|OYqmq1CDaa	I tried it but it made my hair really greasy after my hair dried. If mayonnaise works why doesn't shampoo and conditioner companies use it?<br>  <br>  Also vinegar shouldn't work either. When you use vinegar in food you see that it dries up the contents that it was placed in. I personally haven't used it before but my knowledge of vinegar has stopped me from trying it.<br>  <br>  But life is boring if you don't try new things so go for it if you're convinced it works.

h0jxMlhvaa	I've seen younger people wear eyeliner, and I did in junior high also, don't worry about what others say.<br>  <br>  Anyways...<br>  1. Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment. It's supposed to guarantee zit reducing and mild clearing process in under just 8 hours. I have not tried it yet, but give it a shot.<br>  <br>  2. Wear a waterproof liquid eyeliner and see how you like it.<br>  <br>  3. Getting to bed early is something everyone has a hard time with. The best way is not watching tv before going to bed, listen to some calming music. Also shut the lights off or close your blinds.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1OlnEcRnaa	Ha, I have the exact same problems ; )<br>   <br>  1. its almost impossible to get rid of zits, and I've tried the toothpaste thing, and it didnt work for me, just use a spot treatment and maybe itll work :S<br>  <br>  2. Dont rub your eyes, thats all I can say <br>  <br>  3. dont watch tv or anything, jus read a book or listen to some quiet music, exercising or any activity before you go to bed usually gets your blood going or something and just wakes you up more :)|`|5e6bd6bcb230dec83cfc9309c7d060d5aa	Try toothPASTE dab a little on your pimles and they should dry up some.<br>  <br>  Put some black or dark blue powder of very LIGHTLY.<br>  And bring a mirror to check on it and see if it did smear.<br>  That way you can fix it before it gets too bad :]<br>  <br>  And When I need to sleep I turn on some soft music and relax.<br>  Works for me! :]|`|hmzMd5TLaa	1. Not possible, sorry hun. Use a spot cream, or try a face wash with benzoyl peroxide.<br>  2. If you're using liquid eyeliner, switch to something like kohl, or even something harder than kohl to stop smearing. also a thin layer of neutral shadow and then another layer of eyeliner tends to work. If you stick with liquid eyeliner, let it dry and DON'T rub your eyes.<br>  3. Just....go to bed? Listen to calming music (i.e., not tv!), and lay in the dark for awhile.|`|5Dzxfp01aa	1. not possible. Your best bet is to drink a lot of water and find yourself a decent skincare regiment that will help you get rid of them for good overtime. But there is no overnight-miracle cure.<br>  <br>  2. What kind are you wearing? Liquid eyeliner tends to smear more because of the water content. pencils are oil based and if you have oily skin they sometimes do not set properly. Try dusting on your eyeshadow (with a brush) AFTER putting on your eyeliner to matte it.<br>  <br>  3. Turn off the TV by 9 or 10 and get in bed with a good book. Read until you fall asleep. (or at least it works for me).<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|RFKfPJKCaa	I'm sure this is not what you want to hear, but you can't get rid of your zits by tomorrow. I'm sorry. <br>  To help with zits in the future, tho, you can wash your face in the morning, after exercise/ gym and before bed. <br>  You could also use an acne medicine, there are medicated pads and creams. <br>  Hope this helps some, sorry again (for not giving you the answer you wanted).|`|enLflVPvaa	use tooth paste for your zits and listen to soothing music to help make you fall asleep.And try using a tougher eyeliner or just skip it and put some mascara and a light purple eyeshadow.Light purple brightenes up your eyes.<br>  hope i helped|`|fa0aORcqaa	1. Hmm wash rinse and apply toothpaste to the pimple, doesn't always work but I have had good luck with it.<br>  <br>  2. Apply same color POWDER eyeshadow over it not a lot just enough to cover the line. Ohhhh yes don't rub your freakin eyes.<br>  <br>  3.Set a bed time, 30 minutes before that time relax completely do not do anything but maybe read no working no exercising just relax.|`|ytZ6NU9Xaa	1. IF YOU HAVE PROACTIVE, THEN BABE USE IT!!! USE THE MASK, ANYTHING ELSE DOESNT WORK FOR ME =] . . . IF YOU DONT THEN BABY USE UP ALLL THE CONCEALER, USE THE GREEN OR YELLOW KIND, THEN THE CONCEALER ITSELF, GET A LIGHTER SHADE IF THE ZIT IS RED, THEN USE FOUNDATION =] <br>  <br>  2. FOR THE EYSHADOW, USE A PRIMER, GOOD ONE IS FROM MAC <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.com/</a>  OR JUST USE YOU FOUNDATION AS A PRIMER, OR A CREAM BASED EYESHADOW B4 THE ACTUAL EYESHADOW :D<br>  <br>  3.

Clearasil 3 in 1 daily clenser works WONDERS. Honest! wash your face with it twice a day and by tomorrow it shoulod clear up somewhat, not totally. BUt keep using it in a week or so your face will be alot clearer.<br>  2.) Get waterproof eyeliner, and dont touch your eyes after you put it on<br>  3.) um, just get ready eariler and go to bed eariler. 9:30 10:00 is probably good if your tired.

wzdhIsO5aa	You know, it seems strange that it would be just a "bow", however if it were a regular overhand knot ("regular knot"), it might not have come off.

5jsMY4RIaa	i wash my hair everyday with shampoo and it is fine. it's different for everyone. try using a dry shampoo. They have it at Sephora. You spray it into your hair while it's dry and it gives you a just showered look.|`|B3jpU4Jraa	it doesnt matter just shampoo it you will be fine|`|AA11269060	When they say it's not good to wash your hair everyday they mean shampoo and/or conditioner.  Basically, what washing your hair everyday does is strips the natural oils from your hair.<br>  <br>  Go every other day at least, and this means no putting anything on your hair...shampoo, conditioner, or water.|`|fSn4KSuPaa	that happened because conditioner is what puts the right amount of oil in your hair making it shiny. but since you didnt use shampoo, it came out a little too shiny- to the point of being greasy. <br>  shampoo is what washes it out. <br>  so this time just wash your hair with shampoo thats all.|`|dW1n3ScQaa	Wash it every other day.|`|IROLLdMIaa	conditioner goes on the ends of ur hair and shampoo goes everywhere<br>  do it everyday plz|`|0vi4B928aa	Hun, you cant.<br>  <br>  Shampoo is what gets the grease out of your hair. <br>  <br>  If you want clean and healthy hair, you're going to have to wash it!<br>  Its not the BEST for your hair to wash it everyday. Wash it every other day, or every two days. It's good to give your hair a break. But dont drop shampoo! You need it!<br>  Conditioner isnt NECESSARY, but its a nice touch. It gets your hair soft and shiny =)|`|RoR05Gf3aa	there is this spray you buy, and it basically makes your hair not look greasy. its by garnier fructis and it really works I have it. its called no shower or something like that.

It'll realllllllly go well with your gorgeous complexion and I <3 the color of your eyes!!!<br>  <br>  Here's an example of w/ the eyes: <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2007/stylewatch/blog/070910/hilary_duff_300x400.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2007/st...</a><br>  <br>  A cute cut: <a href="http://i236.photobucket.com/albums/ff173/camr_15alejandra/hilary-Duff.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i236.photobucket.com/albums/ff173...</a><br>  <br>  And a great color: <a href="http://stylespy.instyle.com/stylespy_blog/images/2008/03/19/hilary_duff_in_kenneth_jay_lane.png" rel="nofollow">http://stylespy.instyle.com/stylespy_blo...</a><br>  <br>  It even looks like she has a few minor red highlits in there.<br>  <br>  Whatever you choose, it will turn out GREAT!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oRfzWncyaa	Id say you whould look really good with a dark aurburn color hair. <br>  and straight across bangs|`|TBwuZYetaa	dark brown w/ strait across bangs would look good btw ur sooo pretty<br>  ILY|`|n54adPiBaa	I'm not creating an account to view pics|`|jDRWWPfiaa	I think you would look good if you dyed you hair dark brown like the color of your eyebrows i think it would look more natural and better on you, plus dying your hair dark brown is in style these days. I don't think bangs tht go straight across your forehead would look that great, i thik you should either get side swept bangs and layers to give more volume becuase your head seems sort of narrow. i dont mean that as an insult its just an observation ahah|`|igDWpAlZaa	a medium brown would be gorgeous on you!!!!!. and you should think about getting a lot of medium to long layers. it would look amazing.  :)|`|Lj47nZqjaa	mhmm!<br>  layers with side bangs.<br>  and dark brown/|`|ojwVkQ2oaa	an auburn color would look nice :)|`|jaMq6rGuaa	You should dye it a darker brown.|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Get straight across bangs and dye your hair chocolate brown!

GBOgsAoDaa	light brown would look good, pale colored makeup, peach lipgloss, and pastel colored clothing:)|`|r8VvBxM6aa	That's pretty much my skintone too. Luckily being in the middle usually means you can pull off colors on both ends of the spectrum. Use a lot of gold/beaige tones for eye shadows. Pink lipstick with peach gloss. Any color for clothes would work. It all depends on your mood. Some days my makeups really reserved, while others I''ll use turquoise eye liner or purple eye shadow or something crazy. Bright colors really work with our skin.<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. i actually just made one for an eye shadow tutorial that might help you out, but it's still uploading. it should be up soon. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just type in thatbrowngirl890 on youtube or go straight to the link with<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ThatBrownGirl890" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/ThatBrownGir...</a> <br>  <br>  hope it helps!

WTjPlGbQaa	Im a guy and I am growing my hair out long too. The awkward hair stage is when your hair is shaggy and your bangs are past your eye level, but you cannot tuck them behind your ears yet. Your hair is longer but you cannot really do anything with it. If you have any other questions with growing it out feel free to hit me up with an email?|`|By2QtFigaa	ummm ya honestly i have no idea.|`|M5Sw5SWfaa	I know what you mean.

Whether its just a tad too long or a little too short, it just doesn't look right on you. Everyone has different awkward stages.

They are too expensive and can cost up to 300$! just get some stuff to spray on your hair that locks in moisture and doesn't fry out your hair. because if you straighten it all the time eventually you will fry it. hope i helped!|`|r4xRkqzdaa	hunny, your nose isn't too big- you just gotta learn how to do your makeup.  it's called contouring using a shade darker and lighter than your skin tone.  contouring will also accent your cheekbones.  go to you tube and type in contouring and search for vids.  my fav is by enkore<br>  <br>  use gold and brown eyeshadow to make your blue eyes stand out and always two coats of mascara<br>  <br>  use a brightening concealer under the eyes like benefit's erase paste  to get rid of the dark circles.  also, drink 8 glasses of water a day (no soda) and put warm, damp green tea bags on your under eyes once a week|`|7ulpcNi7aa	You have a good foundation with the eyes so play them up with a black eyeliner and black mascara and add some green eye shadow.

63binSI0aa	Nope. In order for your hair to stop growing you would have to pull out the whole hair shaft including the bulb which is under the skin. Shaving only takes off the hair at the skin's surface so it won't do anything to the way the hair grows.|`|FSuHBCMHaa	This is an old myth that cutting your hair really short can damage your hair or even make it grow faster. the reality is that your hair follicles are beneath the surface of your scalp and even pulling the hair out will not stop it regrowing becuase hair is produced by the follicle. So cut your hair as short as you like. It will grow back.|`|IaFUOuWaaa	I've been shaving my head for about 10 years now, so I share your concern a little bit. But I would have to believe your thinning is the result of you being several years older and not due to you shaving your head.<br>  <br>  You might try using some hair growth stuff before you let it start growing back in... or at least letting it get longer.  There Rogaine and you can get a generic version as Sam's Club or CostCo.<br>  <br>  My friend is using this stuff he got online at<br>  <a href="http://www.hair-raising-story.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hair-raising-story.com</a><br>  <br>  It's working for him.

FsVZCk0laa	It depends.<br>  You could of missed all together.<br>  <br>  Don't kick a guy in the testicles, unless he is doing something BAD. Trying to kidnap you, threatening your life... something a long the lines of that. If the guy was harrassing you by just saying mean stuff, that is NO reason to do that. <br>  <br>  The guy (if kicked hard enough) can become infertile, which means he won't be able to make kids.<br>  <br>  "Can I become infertile if kicked in the testicles?<br>  Talk about a man's worst nightmare. Getting hit in the testicles can be agonizingly painful because the genital area contains the most important concentration of nerves. Therefore, soft touching of the groin feels great while a violent squeeze of the testes is enough to make you hit the ceiling.<br>  <br>  But will a kick to the family jewels make you sterile? It could if it was extremely severe. If the blow induces bruising with signs of bleeding under the skin, don't waste another second before seeing a health professional, as infertility is indeed a possibility. However, rupture of the tunica albuginea (the outermost layer of the testicle), which could hinder the production of sperm, is particularly rare." <br>  -Quote from AskMen.com<br>  <br>  That's a horrible punishment for the smalled disturbance. There was an epedemic that went through my middle school a few years back, where girls would randomly kick guys testicles. A couple guys had to go to the hospital because it was so severe.<br>  <br>  So like I said, don't do that unless that guy is doing something EXTREMEMLY bad.<br>  <br>  <br>  *Edit*<br>  And any girl, or guy for this matter, who kicks a guy in the testicles for no moral reason at all, well, let's just say that you should be able to beat the hell out of that person. It really is that bad.<br>  <br>  I wish I could relate it to something on the female body, but I'm not sure if it'd some close.<br>  Maybe birth would be the only thing that'd be worse.<br>  <br>  *Edit 2*<br>  By the way, adding "*Girls only!*" is just inviting guys. I wouldn't put that if you don't want a lot of guys to answer, lol.|`|blOfX1nhaa	yes I kicked this guy in the balls so hard I did it about 3 times or more and he was on the ground crying saying that he felt like there was a hole in his balls!|`|XCzpQvDvaa	Hey im a guy and have caught a few kicks in the groin and definitely felt them, worst is in soccer but had a few from girls, you probably hit more leg before you got to the balls...but thats all im going to say because you can do some serious damage kicking someone in the balls, and pretty much all the guys i know agree that if you didnt do anything wrong and a girl kicks you in the nuts its perfectly acceptable to drop kick her in the box(and ive been told that hurts).<br>  think about doing something else, i had an uncle who literally lost a nut when his twin brother kicked him in the balls. it got lodged up in his pelvis and then "died" so it had to be removed.|`|jd1xh6Lhaa	dont kick a guy in the balls. its not very nice.<br>  <br>  ps, unless you hit a certain part, it really wont hurt all that much
BohXJpaNaa	I wouldn't do it. But this is just my opinion. Make-up makes you look older and you have to be careful with the quality of the products you use because they can damage your skin. If you really want to wear it, I would start with a mascara and in other day add eyeliner... a bit by bit... or you will make everyone surprise, but if you like the attention who cares,,,just make shure is nicely done.|`|2QYHMoocaa	It depends on what grade your in, if your in middle school i say put  little amount of mascara on, and as for the eyeliner just make a thin line under your eye.<br>  if you wanna go a little overboard though, which some people do, you can put  a line of liquid eyeliner on your eyelid.<br>  makeup is suposed to be used to bring out your features, so yeah i go with just wear a little so it looks semi- natural.|`|igwpoRxkaa	Wear make-up!!<br>  Do what you think<br>  you should<br>  do!!<br>  Hope<br>  I<br>  Helped!<br>  =)|`|Qa3yKIoDaa	why do some girls wear so much makeup to school?<br>  that's stupid.<br>  <br>  if you wear a lot of eyeliner one day, and then none the next.. <br>  you'll look a lot different.|`|Sv9SQqyoaa	it just depends on how much<br>  your face can take of it

ucfR5uHwaa	take a shower<br>  get out<br>  comb through it<br>  towel dry it just a little bit so it's not dripping wet<br>  take little pieces about a half inch or an inch wide<br>  and twist them really tight, all the way to your scalp<br>  then fold the twisted strand in half, and it should kind of wrap around itself<br>  if you need to, take a bobby pin or small clip and clip the end of the wrapped strand up by your roots<br>  then blow dry it until it's mostly dry<br>  and sleep with your hair like that<br>  <br>  wake up, pull out the pins and clips<br>  <br>  and run your fingers through it a little bit but DONT brush<br>  <br>  if you have any, take some light hair spray and spray it into the lenght of your hair<br>  <br>  DONT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TELLING YOU TO BRAID IT! it turns out weird and wavy, not nice and beachy!|`|R4CbyEwWaa	put it in braids=)|`|9Jam6lCKaa	wet it and then braids! <br>  its works super good.|`|dt2Vl76Gaa	to get pretty, wavy hair, wash your hair and when it is still damp you can use a number of products for beachy hair. one of them is very easy to attain, which is water mixed with salt. This literally gives you beachy waves, like you just got back from the ocean, and allow it to dry. To make it even wavier, if you have longer hair, put hair into a loose braid until it dries with the salt spray in it. You can also put your hair into two pigtail buns, and when they dry you'll have a very natural, wavy hairstyle.|`|srjPOxW7aa	Yeah do braids, but if your hair is thick you need to make sure your hair is more dry than damp when you braid it before bed. Also they have a product called beach hair, it actually helps put waves in your hair and I don't know how they do it but it really does smell like the BEACH!|`|rENVXGd3aa	you could shower before you go to bed .<br>  then, braid it and go to bed<br>  when you wake up, take your braids out and wahlah !|`|VJCyQWRzaa	loose plaits from straight hair.|`|Hz2EJTzjaa	braid it while its wet<br>  then let it dry
VenYUtH6aa	There are 3 major malls in San Diego. <br>  <br>  Fashion Valley<br>  Mission Valley<br>  Horton Plaza Downtown<br>  <br>  Mission Valley is the kinda run down mall<br>  Fashion Valley is the biggest mall with the most stores. They have everything from trendy shops like Forever 21, Charlotte Rousse, H+M, American Apparel to designer stores like Armani Exchange, Juicy, and Louis Vuitton<br>  Horton Plaza Downtown is a confusing multi-leveled mall but it is cool cause it is downtown in the Gaslamp Quarter so you also have tons of cute little boutiques, Urban Outfitters, and nice restaurants and bars all within blocks of the mall.<br>  <br>  If you just want to shop, I'd do Fashion Valley. If you want to look around a cool part of San Diego, I'd go to Horton Plaza Downtown and look around. email me if you have more questions.<br>  <br>  :)|`|oQAot9sDaa	Horton Plaza downtown is a beautiful outdoor mall. I wanna go there right now :(<br>  Parkway Plaza in Fletcher Parkway would be a little bit of a drive from Coronado and is a little "ghetto" but it has good stores with cute clothes.<br>  <br>  I actually haven't been to Fashion Valley but I hear it's great! Have fun here in America's Finest City! :)
lwYVJqI1aa	no way fashion is every where and you were it every day. might as well look good. a lot of guys are into fashion in different ways (shoes, sweater such as hoodies *that's me :D*, t shirts, pretty much anything) and people shouldn't judge someones sexual orientation judged on what they are interested in.<br>  so pretty much in summary a career occupation or an interest such as looking good by wearing nice clothes, should not have anything to do with sexual preference.|`|xqljgDHmaa	Dressing well and caring about how you look isn't "gay" and gay shouldn't be synonymous with stupid, either.<br>  <br>  Dressing well and caring about how you look is something EVERYBODY should do. Personal upkeep is a goal that should be met, even by the most Neanderthalish of us.|`|cYktV9B5aa	Noo! All guys wear clothes, thats fashion. Everyone neeeds fashion, so i don;t find it gay at all.|`|7UvOb03eaa	NO WAY.<br>  fashion is sexy.<br>  but only if you have a nice style.<br>  <br>  clean and classy.<br>  :)<br>  <br>  dont worry about other people, just work it!<br>  fashion is all about confidence.|`|8342eb2791b4f481bc2b31b4c0d0dbccaa	Metrosexual, maybe.<br>  Of course, some of the guys fashion actually is totally gay, especially the Ralph Lauren collection this year.<br>  But it is cool for a guy to like fashionable clothing...just...not...too...much|`|DjQrJH8baa	NOOOO!!!<br>  one of my friends, who is a boy, would beat some one up if they said fashion was gay|`|KWl605JTaa	no it's cute and shows he cares about his apperance.<br>  who doesn't like fashion? it's fun|`|5qvIZCKXaa	NOO ! id rather date i guy with a better outfit than a guy who looks terrible :)
UbrN5yytaa	I take those two vitamins too and I believe it's perfectly safe because the dosage isn't high. The hair, skin, nails vitamin also has calcium which will benefit your bones. The multi-vitamin will cover any nutrients you didn't get for the day but the HSN won't.<br>  Just make sure you're getting a healthy diet and drink a lot of water also.|`|51848cb0417bc8292651d510978ff67daa	Quit relaxing/texturizing your hair, maybe you will see healthy hair. With chemicals your hair is constantly breaking or slow growing and maybe the combination of both.

TjPwxbuJaa	I've used vitamin E oil, jojoba oil, or even just regular lotion. The choice really isn't a big deal once the piercing is healed. I do take my tunnels out every day to clean and put lotion on them even today. It helps to keep them healthy.<br>  Congrats on the stretching kit. Back when I started stretching my ears (1999) they didn't exist.<br>  I don't know what size you got them pierced at, but at the smaller sizes (down to 2g or 6mm) I found that I could stretch about every 2-3 weeks without problem. Once beyond that, about a month is needed between stretches. Whatever you do, listen to your body and stop if there is excessive pain. There should never be bleeding.<br>  I personally love my stretched ears and have had them for nearly 10 years and wear 1 1/2 inch (38mm) tunnels and am still stretching very slowly (about a 1/4 inch per year). I never thought I'd go so big but I still love them and don't regret them for a second. They get me lots of attention and I get compliments on them daily, for all sorts of people. And they haven't hindered my career aspirations. However, they are a commitment and they are difficult to reverse. I find it most annoying when I read about somebody who stretched them up only to wish they would go away only a year later.|`|aG9cF5eZaa	Ohjeeeze <br>  The idiot who jus commented saying dont do it<br>  Did yuuu not read the freakin question ? <br>  If you did and you still decided to comment saying dont do it, then you cant read or your jus an idiot. <br>  and i unno which one to use :P Hurray for me being the friend whos also stretching their ears :P|`|4UuhIzikaa	Ewww.

Victoria's Secret is a great place to look for these type of tops. Think of it like buying a bra. Many of the Victoria's Secret bra styles like their "Very Sexy" and "Body by Victoria" come in swim tops too, so if you have a favorite Victoria's Secret bra style, there's a good chance you'll be able to find it as a swimsuit.<br>  <br>  Swim separates that come in cup sizes are another good option. Instead of sizing S-L, they come in cup sizes A-DD or larger. A great swim company who specializes in larger-cup-size swim separates is Aerin Rose. This swimsuit line is made especially for larger busted girls and goes up to cup size G. There are several styles of tops and prints -- I love the peony floral print. So cute!<br>  <br>  Finally, here's a little secret the girls at the store Everything But Water shared with me. Two words: banded halter. The banded halter top is a great shape that offers coverage and support without the sometimes more obvious outline of an underwire. Look for a thicker double-stitched band that goes around the body right under the bust. Stay away from the string halter and stick with this slightly thicker shape. Everything But Water has a great selection of banded-halter-top suits from tons of different swimsuit companies that range in price.<br>  <br>  Happy swimsuit shopping!|`|DKiftd4Naa	ummm...

MehqmwZXaa	I think you can box dye them, but you have to take really good care of them. Keep them moisturized and stuff... Dye will have a damaging effect on extensions as it has on your own hair. <br>  <br>  However, if you're going darker, it will not be that damaging.

Zy3RCkObaa	Trim often and don't use lots of heat. Especially flat irons. Use moisturizing shampoos and conditioners. Garneir also has a good leave in conditioner. And use a deep conditioning treatment once a week. I recommend Neutragena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask. And once a month or every two weeks I use an at home hair mask. Mayonnaise (for moisture) egg yoke(for cholesterol) and avocado (for protein) for a half hour. Trust me it works. Also, use a brush with soft bristles and sleep in braids or buns. That will stop damage from occurring while you sleep.|`|st5reHVjaa	get it trimmed at a salon.

d8EYaNw2aa	because they are high quality and their name is know so they can charge a lot for it!|`|0AQF8pnKaa	The reason people pay a thousand dollars for a Chanel necklace is not because it has precious stones in it, it's because it's Chanel. The same thing applies for BCBG, it's a designer brand, not necessarily because the material they use is quality. Also, owning designer brand accessories and clothing makes people associate you with being rich and many celebrities endorse brands by wearing it or being in their ads. And who really doesn't want to be thought of as being rich or famous?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|akbvn3uMaa	BCBG is a designer brand, and it's expensive mainly because people will buy it at a high price.|`|xqljgDHmaa	Sometimes, it's the quality,<br>  sometimes, it's the appeal.<br>  BCBG isn't fabulously made and it won't last forever, but it's interesting and more hihg-end than other mall chain stores.<br>  It's also the name. Don't you love quoting something? Like, "Oh, this? It's BCBG/Hermes/Banana Republic". We live in a material society, and BCBG caters to that. <br>  <br>  Plus, celebrities like Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus wear BCBG Max Azria on the runway these days.|`|6urbYPyKaa	It is because it is a high end designer brand but their are many outlet malls that sell their clothes that are 75 percent off. I got an amazing 500 dollar BCBG dress for 45 dollars!

ar7TD1xLaa	Think long and hard before getting a tattoo in a language you don't even read - and don't trust the internet to translate for you!  (Have a look at Hanzi Smatter - <a href="http://www.hanzismatter.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hanzismatter.com/</a> - for many examples of why not)<br>  <br>  I love the idea of getting a tattoo to represent your interest and ability in writing poetry.  I think the quill idea is far more interesting, personal, and relevant.  One of my tattoos is a sort of star shape made up of pen nibs and pencil points, which I designed for pretty similar reasons.  I'd suggest just getting loads of images of quills together and taking them along to your tattoo artist.  You can work together to come up with a unique design.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|84d56ed9282d6d1e8596f60d05c3348daa	well chinese symbol for poet is:<br>  <br>  Chinese Pinyin: shi1 ren2 <br>  <img src="http://i7.tinypic.com/35k1zsn.gif"><br>  <a href="http://chineseculture.about.com/library/symbol/blcc_poet.htm" rel="nofollow">http://chineseculture.about.com/library/...</a><br>  <br>  while the chinese symbol for poetry, chant  or song is:<br>  See character in Dialects of China database<br>  sòng [which is in mandarin]<br>  <img src="http://i3.tinypic.com/29osnxe.gif"><br>  <br>  or shī [which is mandarin]<br>  <img src="http://i10.tinypic.com/4dy3nl2.gif"...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.chinalanguage.com/cgi-bin/dict.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinalanguage.com/cgi-bin/dic...</a>|`|YwZ2uuTFaa	诗歌    chinese<br>  詩歌  japanese<br>  there the same things! huh? cool...|`|63add21dd7d2f325cfa7bfc8e4ea4958aa	Japanese characters are called Kanji....easy to find on the net.

Sw8dWauSaa	Smoky eyes...ecco alcune foto...poi te lo descriverò....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thumb8.shutterstock.com/photos/di..." rel="nofollow">http://thumb8.shutterstock.com/photos/di...</a><br>  <a href="http://home.tele2.it/~it-18618/santarell..." rel="nofollow">http://home.tele2.it/~it-18618/santarell...</a><br>  <br>  Eccoti la descrizione :<br>  <br>  Fare lo smoky-eyes richiede un lavoro di precisione, bisogna innanzitutto avere un viso senza imperfezioni...Lo smoky eyes dà un'aria sensuale e profonda... Letteralmente vuol dire "occhi fumosi", Smoky Eyes è una nuova tendenza di make up molto diffusa...E' l'ideale per nascondere piccole imperfezioni (anche se può sembrare che non è da tutte, basta tenere la mano leggera e si adatta ad ogni viso e colore), perchè è un genere di trucco in grado di creare un’illusione ottica, per cui non si capisce dove finisce l’occhio e dove comincia il trucco e soprattutto si adatta bene ad ogni tipo di occhio. Matita nera, Kajal, ombretti marrone, grigio e argento per il tocco finale, mascar nero è tutto quello che serve per realizzarlo....<br>  <br>  Innanzitutto :<br>  <br>  -Le sopracciglia: eliminare con la pinzetta i peletti che compromettono un disegno pulito e, con la matita riempire eventuali vuoti sfumando con il pennellino...<br>  <br>  -Le ciglia: se vuoi ciglia da star, oltre al mascara usa il piegaciglia per curvarle al massimo...<br>  <br>  <br>  Puoi seguire questi consigli :<br>  <br>  Delinea il contorno degli occhi passando alla base delle ciglia superiori e inferiori con una matita nera correggendone gli eventuali difetti ma evita un tratto preciso: tratteggia il tratto o picchiettalo partendo dall’esterno verso l’interno...Poi sfumalo con un pennellino o col dito... L’attaccatura delle ciglia deve essere nerissima!<br>  <br>  Passa sul tratto della matita l’ombretto marrone tenendolo pesante, poi sfumarlo verso le sopracciglia mischiandolo con l’ombretto grigio...<br>  <br>  Passa alla parte inferiore dell’occhio sfumando i due ombretti miscelati sul tratto appena sotto le ciglia...Il trucco deve sembrare naturalmente imperfetto....<br>  <br>  Per un effetto glamour, più brillante e luminoso, puoi usare due ombretti, uno prugna e/o uno blu notte....scurisci l’incavo delle palpebre sfumando il colore (di un solo ombretto o anche di entrambi) verso le sopracciglia...<br>  <br>  Importantissimo il mascara : il segreto è passarlo solo alla base delle ciglia e sulle punte con un movimento a zig zag... Per finire, passa il kajal nella congiuntiva e per creare un punto di luce sotto le sopracciglia, applica un ombretto avorio, beige, o meglio argento (in crema così crea più trasparenza) colore di moda il prossimo anno....E, a lavoro ultimato, per fissare meglio la matita, applica su tutto l'occhio una cipria in polvere trasparente con un pennellone da fard: questo ti garantirà una maggiore tenuta del make up...<br>  <br>  Per il resto del viso opta per un incarnato perfetto, opaco o satinato, con un blush (fard) rosato o salmone (preferibilmente non aranciato) e un rossetto beige/rosato(vietato il gloss, dona un effetto troppo sbarazzino). Per quanto riguarda le sopracciglia, se desideri l’aria un pò selvaggia e anticonvenzionale di chi non dà troppa attenzione a come si trucca, pettinale semplicemente verso l’alto, con un gel per sopracciglia....Se invece vuoi apparire curata e femminile, delinea le sopracciglia con l’aiuto di una matita o un mascara consumato...<br>  <br>  Spero di averti aiutata ciao baci|`|ELLsQAzxaa	metti la crema idratante, eventuale correttore o fondotinta x uniformare, il viso cipria per rendere la pelle un pò più chiara come quella di avril lavigne ,del fard rosato poi ombretto rosa chiaro sull'arcata superiore dell'occhio, ombretto nero o grigio scuro sulla palpera mobile e sotto l'occhio sfumendolo un pò...matita nera sopra e sotto e tanto tanto mascara...magari una un piegaciglie...|`|JOCRG5HPaa	secondo me e' abbastanza semplice l importante e' ke usi la matita nera perke' e'  quella che fa di avril lavigne un trucco tipo punk scuro cmq eccoti la foto<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.magictv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/avril-lavigne.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.magictv.tv/wp-content/uploads...</a><br>  <br>  ciaoo<br>  risp grz<br>  <a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkA6SxfsiAvZ6lQTLUtUX7tDEAx.;_ylv=3?qid=20080802073916AAJzRK5">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  ultima cosa il trucco per gli occhi si chiama smoke eyes<br>  effetto fumo ciao|`|1oTbI6Jjaa	Allora,prima di tutto crema idaratante<br>  <br>  poi cipria,mascara,e tanto eyeliner nero, con ombretto nero sopra e sotto....e un po' di fard, burrocacao,bianko kiss|`|lyeqxnAeaa	 digita su youtube AVRIL LAVIGNE punk goth emo make up insipered look....t dovrebbe venir fuori 1 filmato d panaea81...è 1 ragazza scozese (penso), molto brava nel make up...

It will control the curl to make it appear less frizzy|`|6kv66h1faa	i use it and it works fine for me but i also use moose and hairspray to give ti an extra boost|`|f0dhF8NNaa	I have straight hair, but it's wavy when it's wet. When I used the Herbal Essences Scrunching Gel, it didn't work at all on my hair. You have to have wavy or some curls in your hair. My friend with wavy hair uses it, and it works on her hair. To sum it up, it depends on what kind of hair you have.

bWjVpQhNaa	If you join www.faceparty.com and upload some pictures, there are modelling agencies on that, they email you if they think you are good looking enough. I once got an email off Katie Prices body guard telling me to contact her agency!!|`|t8xFyCt0aa	Look for agencies in major cities near you. Not every small town has one. You might have to move closer to a major are if they accept you. Try to call Ford models (a US based agency) and they might help you find reputable agencies, also the US has an organization called the Better Business Bereau and if you have that in the UK you can shoot them a call. The BBB is available for people to know if any businesses they are associating with have had any major complaints.|`|4QdS8LQkaa	Let me tell you just a few things darling. Personal experience and knowledge of the industry. As you say in your question, you really don't seem to want to know anything because you already know it all, maybe you should change your question.<br>  <br>  So I won't tell you who to contact, although I know, but I will tell you who NOT to contact or deal with.<br>  <br>  Do not have anything to do with any agency that asks you for any money up front for any reason. Money to do get a photographer to do a great portfolio for you, discard that agency immediately regardless of the promises. They make their money by getting you to pay for their services, not from commission for bookings they get for you, which is how a proper agency works.<br>  <br>  So remember, if anyone asks you for money for anything, do not give it to them and go and look elsewhere.<br>  <br>  Further, let me advise you, you are obviously committed to becoming a model. Just that statement alone is quite scary for someone your age. You see, you need to provide more info. What kind of model do you want to be. Someone else has told a story about someone who worked for Katie Price telling them to contact her agent. First of all be so totally sure it's real before you even bother to reply. And then decide, do you want to be a glamour model showing your boobs and stuff on page 3 and mens mags, or do you want to be a fashion model? Or maybe a specialist advertising model because you have a particular feature like amazingly nice feet. Don't laugh, there are foot models who make a fortune, so many people, even the world most beautiful people have horrible feet that won't stand up to a close up shots.<br>  <br>  Apart from which you are trying to do something that only about 1 tryer out of every 5,000 even has a minor career<br>  <br>  Not putting you off, just telling you. Don't give money to anyone, decide what type of model you want to be. Research the agencies that deal in that market, then go and walk the streets carrying copies of your portfolio that you pay for yourself.<br>  <br>  Please also keep in mind that all the top or so called super models over the past 20 years were MOSTLY discovered walking down the street minding their own business without ever thinking about being a model. Kate Moss was noticed by a talent spotter from an agency at an airport having just returned from holiday with her family. Naomi Campbell was discovered on a day out with her friends getting up to mischief at Covent Garden. Natural talent gets to the top<br>  <br>  But good luck darling you seem to be quite strong willed and determined. Just be sure that you are not too strong willed that you don't listen to advise from [people who know more then you. Finally, so your parents think you would be perfect to be a teenage model. Sounds just like every set of parents in the whole wide world. Thing is parents don't know what it takes, only industry professionals know. Glamour models are pretty, fashion models mostly are not, they have a particular look, sometimes quirky and uniquely attractive rather then traditionally beautiful. It's not always like that, but designers are artists, and have an unconventional eye. Parents have a bias so their opinion is not really relevant regarding if you have it or not. Get professional advise. If you were not so dismissive in your question I would have told you who to contact. Take care now|`|HzDM3L38aa	I think we can help you more if you show us some pictures.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :P|`|tTyNZg3Uaa	check online

7MIWmkFhaa	It would depend on how much hair you're removing. If your doing a full head, there's a Men's depilatory powder. You can get it at the local supermarket. It looks like a round can of regular powder, you mix this with water, smooth on, take off - just like Nair.  It conditions the skin & doesn't cause the ingrown hairs or razor stubble that sometime pop up

And that was that. <br>  <br>  In a month, you can do the same thing. Your parents have no say what you do when you are 18. You don't need parental consent because you will be an adult. Unless they are so strict they will kick you out of the house or something for getting it, then of course I wouldn't do it. I would hope not though.<br>  <br>  As for your job, you can't just replace it with a retainer because you have to wait 3 months before you can take it out.

None of my family really liked it but they're used to it now and dont even really notice.<br>  <br>  Just casually mention how someones nose piercing looks really cool. They'll probably give you a reaction, either positive or negative. If negative....then you can go in to 'your case'. It's very small, it can be taken out, there are clear retainers that can't be seen, its a custom in some countries, etc. <br>  <br>  I dunno, how humorous your family is. But i would have a 'family meeting' and make up a bunch of graphs and stuff to prove your case. :)<br>  <br>  Anywho, i hope it works out for you! I love my nose  piercing and i wouldnt trade it for the world!!<br>  <br>

Sometimes the things you would never try on are the things you love. If only I had a picture of you I would be able to suggest some clothes, but here a a few pointers:<br>  x Do NOT every buy a fuzzy sweater/sweatshirt.<br>  x Buy from junior's sizes stores, which most stores are.<br>  x Landsend and LL Bean are uncomfortable.<br>  x Don't but things from multi-stores like Sears, Target, Walmart, etc. They fall apart after a few months and are uncomfortable. Seriously.<br>  x Things with the brand label plastered all over them is not very cool.

If it's in the beach, try getting some sandals with a little heel like this...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dsw.com/dsw_shoes/catalog/product.jsp?index=83&category=cat20034&prodId=109787&brand=" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsw.com/dsw_shoes/catalog/pro...</a><br>  <br>  These don't cost as much as the others, yet they're really cute!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dsw.com/dsw_shoes/catalog/product.jsp?index=234&category=cat20034&prodId=179992&brand=" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsw.com/dsw_shoes/catalog/pro...</a><br>  <br>  These are adorable!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dsw.com/dsw_shoes/catalog/product.jsp?" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsw.com/dsw_shoes/catalog/pro...</a><br>  index=249&category=cat20034&prodId=179...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dsw.com/dsw_shoes/catalog/product.jsp?index=257&category=cat20034&prodId=179757&brand=" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsw.com/dsw_shoes/catalog/pro...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dsw.com/dsw_shoes/catalog/product.jsp?index=275&category=cat20034&prodId=173918&brand=" rel="nofollow">http://www.dsw.com/dsw_shoes/catalog/pro...</a><br>  <br>  I don't know your age but it really doesn't matter that much but  I hope you like these shoes! Oh and I used DSW so just try to find some at DSW like go to www.dsw.com! Hope you find the shoes!<br>  <br>  The girl who loves your dress.|`|DdwI9e9Aaa	I think a golden color will fit well. You can try zappos, a lot of choices.|`|T1U0jTTsaa	You're lucky - pretty much anything will go with that! What's the colour theme for the wedding? You could use that. e.g. purple shoes with purple jewelry and a purple flower in your hair. <br>  <br>  Beautiful dress :)|`|7riQpOy7aa	you could have gold or black shoes flats or sandals if you want to dress it down or heels if you want to dress it up. i would personally recommend heals|`|YZ7HOZ3raa	wow i really like the dress! i think a pair of chocolate brown heels would look good, i think black would also look good:)|`|te5rxddmaa	HUM silver shoes would go Grata sandals maybe but got to have toes done in that case. gold sandals would also b a nice idea but NO WHITE SHOES PLEASE they are a big fashion no no. good luck|`|AA10287674	gold shoes|`|2Zpf6EUwaa	Gold strappy sandals would be nice. Like these:<br>  <a href="http://www.shoewawa.com/god-straoppy-sandals.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.shoewawa.com/god-straoppy-san...</a>|`|EXtpwkMyaa	Black. White would be too close to it and black would be a cool nad modern contrast.|`|8v5YatPsaa	bright white heels with a watching bad would look really good<br>  maybe these not the best example though<br>  <a href="http://www.asos.com/Paris-Hilton/Asos/Asos-Leather-T-Bar-Platform-Shoes/Prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=298424&cid=6461&clr=White&sh=0&pge=0&pgesize=20&sort=_None" rel="nofollow">http://www.asos.com/Paris-Hilton/Asos/As...</a>|`|5sCpMpbWaa	<a href="http://www2.victoriassecret.com/collection/?cgname=OSSHUSDLHHE&cgnbr=OSSHUSDLHHE&rfnbr=5990" rel="nofollow">http://www2.victoriassecret.com/collecti...</a>|`|D6LJJ1AYaa	i would stick w/ a metallic or black sandal. if you are tall i would do something strappy, if you are shorter i would just make sure it doesnt wrap around your ankle.|`|AA10295791	Gold shoes! Go for wedges or flats! Silver would look lovely as well, and you could even try balck or an olive color! Anything goes, have fun and good luck!
6zzqTw5baa	Wow i love your style :) my hairss that exact colour, i love it :D<br>  I blow dry mine but yer like they say wait till the next day or next time youv washed it to straighten it :)<br>   I tend to do mine on a day im not going out e.g. sunday, then wack it on giving it the day to dry its self so it feels lovely next time i wash it, all silky after a crazy hair day :)|`|9AUmp5jWaa	I would condition condition condition for a few days before I straighten it.|`|h38M7Eofaa	i don't think so, just because your hair is already conditioned from the color.  although, i would cut back blow drying and straightening about a week after because your hair will become more brittle and damaged.|`|CNHtFquWaa	its not good to straighten it right after dying it<br>  but you can blow dry it<br>  <br>  straightening it after dying it will kill it.<br>  wait until the next day to straighten it|`|Vge3KBaMaa	so whats the problem then ?
LJkPRqN0aa	first you need to actually post a picture because we cant really even determine if you will look good with a simple description that you put. it is pointless......<br>  <br>  edit: outch doesnt sound like we are being the B****es hun....grow up. none of us has said anything insulting to you, you ASKED for opinions your got it. dont expect anything else|`|I0JBGllLaa	<a href="http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/img/5519/Alicia/639l.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/img/5519...</a>|`|CdYvOnZqaa	i think u should cut your hair a little shorter like cut 3 inches off and put on some side bangs.. i think it would look nice b/c i have glasses and i have brown hair and mi hair is like that.. i think i might be good... emo look wont rly work so dont try if ur not sure about it..|`|YAjmiDJraa	I think you should part your hair like way right/left and then layer your bangs so they would hang across your face. Idk if I explained that very well, but I guess sorta like Amy on the Secret Life..just more layers.|`|MtpO6RUiaa	I would say no. That style is more of a fad anyway
WkcYzNjSaa	Where did you find it at?! <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I've never used the red cooper - only the black. I have brown hair with light brown/blonde highlights. When I used the black, it didn't turn my hair one solid color - and that's why I like this stuff so much. The blonde highlights ended up looking a dark brown and it actually looked pretty cool and had dimension. It also faded pretty well and never looked any weird color like the similar herbal essences one I had used prior.  <br>  <br>  It's a fun way to change up your look that's not too permanent. It should wash out completely in a couple weeks, It's easy to use, there is a lot of product in the can (I had enough and more left after doing my thick hair that is almost down to the small of my back), and it smells fairly decent.<br>  <br>  But anyways, I thought they had discontinued this stuff. I haven't been able to find it for a long time. Let me know where you got it from!
a47137YVaa	Use that foamy stuff or ask your hairdresser.
yjkEgH6Yaa	Me and my mom usually go to the following stores:<br>  <br>  A.J Wright<br>  Target<br>  Macy<br>  J.C Penny<br>  Victoria Secrets<br>  <br>  We also shop online from the following:<br>  mertostyle.com<br>   <br>  <br>  I hope this helps for your survey and you can check them out too|`|c3j49t9Faa	I shop the most at Victoria's Secret & I pay attention to the catalogs they send out with up to 70% off on them most of the time.|`|oIGuYhvbaa	gap. banana republic. jcrew. ann taylor loft.|`|WWaB7G58aa	Hollister, American Eagle. Lots of color, and like very sexy ones. =]|`|opaMeWyIaa	Hollister, Abercrombie, Ed Hardy and American Eagle.<br>  <br>  And none of them really have ads out there.|`|nZpGi3zyaa	Hollister, Abercrombie|`|TAdguHjzaa	holister and abercrombie|`|VLfJviaYaa	american eagle! and cute guys are a great choice for bags...|`|d8EYaNw2aa	i shop at Saks Fifth Avenue and i love designer stuff and they are really nice their!|`|HhXQnSznaa	Dillard's!
paOPuM4Paa	Its possible I ordered a jacket online and I got it three days later so I guess it depends on how fast they ship stuff :)<br>  Hope this helped!|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	when did he order it?
g2GogSALaa	I would rather have the first one, but Abercrombie is most definitely NOT a high brand shirt. Think Gucci or Ralph Lauren and Bebe. THAT is high brand. American Eagle's/ Hollister's shirt quality is actually about the same as Aeropostale. Trust me.<br>  <br>  :]|`|XSwl1kjUaa	10 Who really cares about the brand names. You don't see Angelina Jolie on the streets wearing a t-shirt saying chanel written all over it!|`|Azengymsaa	1st choice. And FYI, American Eagle, Hollister, and Abercrombie aren't high-quality. Most people can afford that. Brands like BCBGMAXAZRIA, Ralph Lauren, and Juicy Couture are high-quality.<br>  What makes Aeropostale different from American Eagle, Hollister, and Abercrombie? They all look the same to me.|`|bZxKn3ZUaa	definitely ten decent looking alright quiality shirts.  those shirts can still be super cute and you get more use out of them.  if you choose the 2nd option<br>  <br>  -who wants 3 exactly the same shirts that say HOLLISTER in 3 different colors?? where is the variety??|`|Ao5aSAWiaa	Ten shirts.<br>  At least I won't be rewearing my clothes every 3 days.|`|8DhmRwMraa	the first choice =]]|`|paOPuM4Paa	Well it depends what the shirts look like and I don't think American Eagle, Hollister, Abercrombie are good quality brands they just charge more because they know people will buy them...Aero is they same quality at least of American Eagle <br>  Hope this helped|`|rR90iLB0aa	2:hollister or abercrombie.but there not so good quality anyways... so maybe urban planet. or just go to urban outfitters for better qualit clothing.|`|d8EYaNw2aa	um first of juicy couture really isn't high end becuase so many people can afford it! and i would say the abercrombie and ae shirts|`|SqR61AWsaa	Three very good quality high brand shirts definitely They'd last longer|`|4m4NRJJ1aa	Three very good quality high brand shirts|`|xL3aw03eaa	1st choice :)|`|9ufmeaUyaa	I would rather have the second one. What would you have?|`|EXtpwkMyaa	neither. I'd rather go out and buy one AMAZING Dior dress.|`|hy6Xa0Tqaa	american eagle, hollister and abercrombie aren't good quality, just overpriced and all their stuff looks the same so i would go with the first one. and i agree with the person who said aeropostal isn't different from american eagle, hollister and abercrombie.|`|TAdguHjzaa	high branf shirts there alot cuter but i dont like AE i luvvvv ABERCROMBIE AND HOLLISTER they hav the bestyest clost in the wholle inteire worldddd!|`|WvZHrBfxaa	I say the more the better .

So when you go to the hairdressers, you don't need as much cutting off.. (:<br>  Use heat defence sprays when straightening/blowdrying too.<br>  It should be better in the summer because the winter weather does alot of damage to your hair, (:<br>  You could try this too <a href="http://www.leestafford.com/uk/products/product.php?pi=37" rel="nofollow">http://www.leestafford.com/uk/products/p...</a>|`|oj8oCNzGaa	kerestase- bain de force hair and conditioner. also a good treatment is lee staffords " hair that never grows past a certain length" .<br>   NO bleach go brunette if your not already. and trim the split ends. so they're strong and don't snap after heat treatments.|`|5Ive0UABaa	its a pain in the neck, im doing it to. but anyways you have to get trims every month or so, dont ruin your ends too much, and make sure its healthy and clean. but besides that, you just have to wait.|`|vAhpjdNJaa	time.<br>  nothing else can make your hair grow faster without completely damaging it. <br>  i know it's annoying, but i'm doing it too. hang in there.|`|fSwzNFL5aa	deep conditioning treatments once a week<br>  trim every 4-6 weeks<br>  using correct shamp./cond. for your hair<br>  don't straighten blow dry or use hot curling iron too often|`|blVwRPcAaa	Im trying to figure that out too. but i would go to a hair dressers and say that you are growing your hair and ask them to take as little off as possible. If you just leave your hair and dont get it trimmed, it will get very damaged and you will have to have lots and lots cut off. If you are deperate to make your hair look longer, try clip in hair extensions.
DMeKUJ6Saa	i think you just wear it to the wedding, but you could wear it at the party aswell. i dont think it would do any harm.<br>  if u want to take it out and are worried about having a kink where it has been then maybe just pin yiour hair back with a hair grip/ bobby pin.|`|N0sWaZn1aa	i'd wear it to the wedding then if you want take it off for the reception,<br>  reception are not as formal really x|`|XXnMgwxYaa	if you get one thats not to flamboyant then you can keep it on as long as you want.<br>  accessorize do great ones :)|`|U5gixzszaa	i think that it would be fine have fun and good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|TuBzc1R5aa	ummmm....don't mean to sound dumb, but what's a fascinator?? lol?

NyyRuaVqaa	Try being more specific, because there are too many to list here. Do you have a specific price range or subfashion you want to look for? <br>  <br>  Since most people want the cheapest they can find, I'll first direct you to Anna House. Anna House has the cheapest prices you'll find for good quality lolita clothing, (their prices are in Hong Kong dollars, don't let it confuse you) and it's not to hard to order. <a href="http://www.annahousefashion.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.annahousefashion.com</a><br>  <br>  If you'd prefer to order from somewhere in the country, (because of shipping prices or anything like that) assuming you live in the US, In the Starlight would be a nice choice. <a href="http://www.inthestarlight.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.inthestarlight.com</a><br>  <br>  If you don't care so much about the prices, you should check out Baby, the Stars Shine Bright. They're definitely my favorite store. <a href="http://www.babyssb.co.jp" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyssb.co.jp</a>|`|DMeKUJ6Saa	<a href="http://www.lolitagirlclothing.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lolitagirlclothing.com/</a>
3yacqUltaa	Um you could pin socks to like your shirt and your jeans and stuff, and cuff the bottom of the jeans up a lot so the socks that your wearing show. <br>  Back in the day could be talking about when you were little, in the early 1900s, or any possibilities! So, if you wanted to do when you were little, look up styles of your birth year and make an outfit from that. Good luck!

Peridress.com posts photos they find on the internet of designer dresses.  Then when you order, u give them your measurements, and they make a dress BASED ON THE PICTURE.  So it is NOT an original from the brand or designer featured in the picture.  If you look hard enough, it even says this on their website.  So you are taking a risk.  The fabrics and construction may not be as good of quality.  I've also heard that if you are unhappy with your order, they are very difficult to get ahold of and difficult to make a return.  Trust your gut.. when something seems too good to be true, IT USUALLY IS.|`|XCtKpwkwaa	they usually ship ems so it shouldnt take more than 15 days, it is very safe to pay with either paypal or credit card because they both have buyer protection.<br>  <br>  you will have your dress way before you need it!!!!!!|`|mhn3u2EBaa	It should be okay since americans get most of their clothes from foreign countries and especially china lol. but its a very pretty dress so i think you should get it.|`|lmtusbb7aa	WOW thats lush, <br>  <br>  umm i would email them and ask them a few questions, i really cant say whats reliable and whats not. good luck. x|`|9Lhf9jiHaa	well how long will ittake to alter it?<br>  it would prob take a month max to arrive at your doorsteps..|`|CU16W6Tqaa	i think you should get the dress.

NRADLcVbaa	Bangs are always cute especially if you have an oval or heart shaped face. But fair warning if you have never cut your hair before, bangs are a big commitment---you will have to get regular trims and if you ever decide to grow them out you will have to be really creative trying to pin them back (and some days they will look a bit crazy while you grow them out). Also if you are getting them for summer they may make your forehead sweat and/or breakout (if you are prone to breakouts)!|`|1o7hk8rKaa	honestly everyone can pull of side swept bangs. and just don't cut them to short cause if you don't like them then you can go back to the part you have now|`|i11M3kSvaa	Everyone looks good in bangs.

kYfZCy9Kaa	Frizz-Ease by John Frieda|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Well for starters, your hair has a natural curl and Kristen Stewarts is man made curls lol<br>  <br>  I have crazy curly hair too and it frizzes a lot..<br>  <br>  How often do you wash your hair? dont wash it every night. Sometimes you can wash it without the shampoo. Just use the conditioner. But make sure not to use very much or it will get oily.<br>  <br>  You can also try using dryer sheets through your hair if you have fly away..  but this sometimes makes girls hair oily, depending on how fine their hair is.  Worth a try though!!<br>  <br>  I use Biolage shampoo and conditioner for frizzy hair.<br>  Its kinda expensive but it lasts forever and its AMAZING! Smells so good too.<br>  You can get it at Beauty Brands or most salons.<br>  <br>  Your braid may be contributing to the frizz too.. I know when i braid my hair it frizzes.<br>  Also, if you use a blow dryer, set it at a low setting, and use a wide round brush to dry it.<br>  <br>  When its a bit damp you can use a bit of mousse, put a little in your hands and twist your hair around your fingers to get a light curl.<br>  <br>  Not really sure exactly how your hair is... but i hope that helps a little|`|XPShnPIlaa	sunsilk - waves of envy<br>  $4 at walmart and drugstores<br>  in a light blue container w/ the<br>  name on it..it is actually<br>  swirled in the bottle..but it <br>  does wonders..just follow the<br>  directions on the bottle.. :)|`|JSgG8nvYaa	well... ur hair is natural like that probably, or it just may need some product. also, try a shampoo & a good conditioner & don't rinse it in hot water, because then ur gonna get the case of frizzies. intead, rinse it in cooler water. <br>  if u don't blow dry ur hair, flip it upside down, and dry it by squeezing all the water out with the towel, this way u should get some spirals, and nice curl or wave =)|`|GStq1wOfaa	srry to tell u but shes an actress nd she has a whole group of ppl tht spend hours workin on her hair...but if u want it to jus be less frizzy...i wud say jus put a lot of gel and a little hairspray...and u could add sum anti friz stuff from loreal before puttin anthing else into it|`|CdYvOnZqaa	you should get a straightner and straightin it at nite then give it a few touch upps in the morning.. more likely u need it cleaned every nite to stay defrizzed..
29ALawbhaa	Okay so I hope I can help, as I am a natural redhead as well, and my sister happens to be a hair stylist! <br>  My hair is more on the brown, rather than orange side of red. It is auburn in the winter, but brighter red in the summer.<br>  What I have found, is that when I put highlights in my hair it makes my skin tone appear different, and my freckles stand out more. So when I highlight my hair I tend to not put too much blond around the frame of my face. However since you have some blond tones you might not get the same effect.<br>  I love putting darker shades of red, or even brown lowlights in my hair. I think it pairs wonderfully with red hair. <br>  Its just my personal suggestion that as a red head, we can have some pretty "loud" hair as it is. So I try and keep the thickness and colors on the natural side. You can get a huge punch of color in your hair w/o going overboard.<br>  Basically I would go to a professional. They should be able to tell you which levels of blond/brown will compliment your particular shade the best. Good luck!|`|AA10063288	I would say stick with a highlight that is golden with yellow tones. Highlights that are white or ashey just don't look good on a fair redhead. Plus, it is very hard to find a hair dye to cover up mistakes since red is so hard to match. My favorite is Colora Henna in chestnut.|`|iCFiT1uKaa	brown, it looks great!<br>  one of my bestfriends have red hair and they got brown highlights <br>  OMG it was gourgouse!|`|kDiFMEKuaa	I think it would look good with lighter reds and maybe Evenbrowns or dark golds. I would keep it dark if you said it naturally lightens.|`|xCifmFfkaa	If you'd like us to properly judge, perhaps a better picture would be in order.

It's kind of like hair dye it will start to grow out as your natural straight her grows in. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about explaining to friends, maybe curl your hair with tongs or rollers before you get the perm. When they all have said how much curls suit you they won't be surprised when you never go back to straight!|`|KGppArcfaa	Perms have come a LONG way since the 80's. Getting perm doesnt mean poodle curls and frizz anymore.<br>  The hair dresser may be able to give you the curls you want, just be sure to bring in pics and explain throughly.<br>  <br>  I have had many perms and it didnt damage my hair, it made my hair healthier cuz i wasnt using heat all the time.<br>  <br>  They loosen up a little after two weeks, but it should last a while, generally I like to get it done every 5 months<br>  <br>  Spiral perms dont look like shirly temple curls at all hun, msg me thru yahoo if you want and ill send you a pic of my hair permed

You can also take some scrunch spray (like aussie) and spray a little of that after your hair is dry.|`|dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  You don't need to use products to get that. Just scrunch your hair from wet and let it dry naturally. Perhaps put a little serum through your hair to stop any frizzyness but that's about all you need to do.<br>  <br>  If it goes curlier than you want then just wet it again (but dont scrunch) and some of the curl will drop out of it.<br>  <br>  ~Mystic.

Some people say you can put mascara on them but i never do this because i like to re-use them (i ALWAYS put mascara on my own eyelashes before applying them tho)<br>  <br>  best tips are to wait 30sec after putting the glue on for it to go tacky before putting it on your eyelid, put a little bit extra on each end, cut the lashes to the right length for your eyelid, and after putting on the eye hold in place for approx 30sec-1min|`|J1stiMioaa	eyelure are reasonably priced, available from superdrug/boots (uk), measure them against your eye and trim accordingly if the are too long<br>  apply glue to the false lash and wait a minute until it is tacky, apply as you look downwards using tweezers to press the glued strip down. glue them to your lashes not the eyelid skin (common mistake!), this way they will last about a week<br>  eyelure 119 and 112 are good natural looking ones|`|VhWll8Vjaa	E.L.F sell false eyelashes and they cost ￡1.50 per pair. So a good price to use for practice.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eyeslipsface.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.eyeslipsface.co.uk</a>|`|s0zPqiIBaa	The dollar store carries them. Or you can order a bunch on ebay. My fav brand or Red Cherry Lashes.<br>  <br>  Strip lashes should last about a week or two, depending on how well you take care of them.<br>  <br>  Individuals should last alittle longer because they are places separately.

Also not washing your hair as often will make the dye last longer.|`|2qPtGTNcaa	Yes, it does happen. Your hair's porosity changes as you use dye. It dries it out. This means that it may not take the dye as thoroughly. You have to condition your hair every single week when you use dye. I find that avocados make one of te best conditioners before a dye job. Also, Pantene air mask is great. I put it on, then I apply the dye with the conditioner on.|`|7355ad702ae490769df9563b4fb4bed6aa	I have a similar problem, my hair doesn't seem to hold jet black color like it used to. <br>  <br>  Maybe it's because you've dyed your hair a lot... Black dye can be really damaging if you don't know what you're doing with it. Even in the best situation it can make your hair really dry. <br>  I would say that it's possible you've diminished your hair's ability to retain color by drying the strands and making them brittle, except I have no idea why that would affect the roots since new hair growth should be 100% healthy and natural :P<br>  <br>  Sorry I just rambled and didn't really help much.

You can always go to the mall and buy a shrug to go with it. There's nothing much you can really do other than what I've already said. Maybe you can try wearing a scarf or something of that sort. And if not, then just wear the top some other day.|`|nn8AdxnZaa	if you have a shirt like the white one in this pic it would look cute<br>  <a href="http://www.angiehearts.net/v/vspfiles/photos/ah1089-2T.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.angiehearts.net/v/vspfiles/ph...</a><br>  or<br>  if you have a vest like this<br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/fashion/1/0/j/-/3/80192191_10.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/fashion/1/0/j/-/3/8...</a><br>  or just wear a tank top those look cute underneath|`|ZDZlvqvsaa	Go to the mall. most Jackets will probably be on sale since it is getting warm.

There are fat skinny girls who have no muscle and are mostly fat but still a size 2.  There are girls who are fit and healthy but are a size 16.  I don't think size is necessarily an issue.  Body fat is an issue, BMI is an issue, and health problems are the issue.

It won't hurt your hair.  However, if you have scalp Psoriasis, you need to use something like a medicated shampoo.  Try Neutragena T-Gel Shampoo.  I wash my hair daily but only use it once or twice a week.|`|BREi7qw7aa	uhh thats prolly not smart.. concidering horse hair is totally differnt and way less sensitive then humans.. so shampoo made for horses wont have the same effect on your hair!|`|xBhqifN4aa	Yes.

Gew6pZhbaa	It's not going to fall out, and it shouldn't become overly damaged. I've been straightening my hair for about 7 years now (along with coloring it) and my hair is in good condition. I also take very good care of it. I take a multivitamin containing Niacin and Biotin to give my hair the nutrients to keep it healthy, trim it at least every three weeks, use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner (L'Oreal Vive Pro for dry/damaged hair) and use a heat taming cream before straightening. If you don't take care of your hair, you will most likely cause severe damage. If you follow the steps to keep your hair healthy and give it the moisture it needs, you can maintain the healthy hair you already have.|`|PPdsvTO8aa	it could damage the ends of hair, and if could slow the process of your hair growth a tad. i haven't really noticed it in my hair though.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	you should be using a heat protector and deep conditioning your hair weekly in order to prevent damage but flat ironing your hair everyday regardless isnt good|`|J4tmtaRlaa	it will be fried.<br>  like mine.<br>  it will break off so does mine.<br>  <br>  <br>  help me?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090308180852AAhQMoT&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|fzyVvvZtaa	Your like me i straighten my hair everyday and your hair will not fall out ahahah :) but you have to be careful, first right when you get out of the shower you should put in a good heat protector then straighten it becauz for the longest time i didnt put in the heat protector and the ends of my hair began to ball up and i had so many dead ends!!!! then i had to get my hair cut short!!! UGH! so if you are gunna be straightening your hair i have advice use a good mousturizing conditioner then heat protecter then after is it completely dry you can begin to straighten but as you straighten the slower you go over each peice of hair the less you will burn it!!!|`|T4ZDojoUaa	Use a medium setting and use some kind of frizz control product to protect your hair. I use a straightener on my hair to finish the style every day and it looks fine. You are not "burning your hair straight" anymore than an iron burns your clothes straight.|`|uHPG6ETBaa	Most likely, your hair will not fall out, but the only way your straightener is able to straighten your hair is to burn it into place, so clearly it is not good for your hair.<br>  <br>  After a while, your hair will start to feel brittle, and look very damaged|`|5v1c50Ybaa	your hair will not fall out, just get dry and frizzy. just buy a repairing/moist shampoo along with a non-frizz conditioner, and try avoiding blow-drying it.|`|5KdXVKrJaa	you will get split ends<br>  they suck!|`|GhsqaXsdaa	You will get split ends :(<br>  <br>  I have been straightening my hair for a year, every day.

BOUlr1OMaa	Yell at him. that's what I do to my brothers. Don't take any crap from him, let him know that you'll get him if he touches you again. He's got no right to touch you like that and hate to break it to you, but really, you don't have a right to touch or hurt him either. If you go along and give him 'a taste of his own medicine', that will make you no better than he is. Don't stoop that low, and fighting fire with fire doesn't work! And personally, I think getting all up in their faces and letting them know that I'm better than that, that I'm not some defenseless helpless child is more fun than physically hurting them. :)|`|Grq9sVuBaa	HaHa this is such a funny question. RANDOM!!!!<br>  Don't kick him in the balls trust me it sounds really odd right now to you, but you'll be thanking your brother for picking on you when you get older, I have an older brother and he used to beat the crap outta me now I thank him for it, b/c I'm a much stronger person from it.|`|5KdXVKrJaa	ummm first of all<br>  why the hell is your brother<br>  grabbing your boobs?????????<br>  weird......|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	Chat calmly to him and then when he least expects it (wearing shoes) kick him right in the y'no whats!

0xp9Oobnaa	first of all, you need to know how to setup a local small business no matter what type it is. You need a license to open a business that's if you qualify of your financial or income and other reasons, cause you can't just start with 20k to start a business even when you are buying things and paying your rent and utilities, also don't' forget to pay your employee's.  Also you need to renovate your shop how you want it and as of course again buying hairdressing equipment.<br>  <br>  so my suggestion right now is not the time to open a business especially this time during the economy, but if you have money then go ahead, cause rents should be getting cheaper.<br>  <br>  So before you start anything, you should look over your financial and income if that your own money can handle to open a business, you should start asking a financial adviser from your Bank and local Government (city hall, court house ect.) to get your license and getting advice of your financial. It would be more easier to do it with a friend so you both can split your total cost to run that business.|`|hhWDHmfyaa	Scam 1 - Look at tax leins on the business and the location.<br>  Scam 2 - Look at Landlord history.  A scam is for you to walk in paying $50 monthly rent, and build a hot, profitable business.  Landlord then evicts you and sets up that exact same business there, but only staffs the business with hairdressers, then takes all profits.<br>  <br>  Rather than purchasing inventory to sell to your clients while you are building your business, look at renting shelf space to a line of hair care products, another to a jewelry vender, and possibly an area to a clothing vendor.  This way, you are increasing your lines for income beyond simply the chair.<br>  <br>  I've audited a few of them and those are the big flags.  Another big flag is to avoid partnerships. It nearly always ends the business and the friendship quickly.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

Also, try some oil. If you have olive oil around the house then put that in your hair this will help with slippage and you might get it untangle that way. My curly hair will sometimes (not often) form tiny knots on the ends, but I put some coconut oil in my hair and take my fingernails and get them loose without any breakage. Granted, my tiny knots are nothing compared to one big dred.

8624d8f3c13640e544dfac9ee3736a3faa	Once you've had a bad result with home dying, you should go to a stylist to have it fixed.  Chances are if you keep dying it yourself, you're going to keep having problems with the color.  Reds are especially the worst to get right or fix by yourself.  If you're not careful, you could end up with orange or purple hues to your color.|`|1KfbgBupaa	You can easily damage your hair by so much processing and I'd recommend you go to a professional, taking with you the box of dye you used on it last night.  However, if you don't do this then I'd recommend you buy the same brand/type of color and use that; also, there's generally a phone number on the box of product that you could call and ask them if it's OK to dye again so soon... tonight or tomorrow night really isn't that much difference in time.  Does the red brown look good on you?  If so, keep it.

btMmriQvaa	Dye it all you want.<br>  <br>  Now if you were bleching your hair then i would say not 3 times in one day|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	give it a break for one month, apply some poducts from boots then redye it again.|`|AA12074512	no your fine..|`|m9eySP2Paa	just do it. i've done it before.<br>  and afterwards CONDITON CONDITION CONDITION! with a DEEP conditioner and a hot oil treatment found at sally beauty supply.<br>  <br>  it will effect the texture of your hair, but if you really take care of it afterwards than you will be fine|`|pZXdqXNQaa	na you will be fine!<br>  if your worried once your done deep codition it but honestly u will b fine!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|VEgv5NhSaa	You'll be okay x|`|l2vKkKPwaa	yeah it probably will. One time I dyed my hair brown the it didn't do anything to my hair. Then a week later I used 2 boxes of blond(not bleach) hair dye to make it brown, but it dyed my roots orangey blond and didn't do anything much but gave my hair a little auburn color to it. But then I recolored it to black.<br>  <br>  Now every time i wash my hair it feels like pieces of straw and is extremely hard to comb when wet. It looks a little dull but is still shiny looking. but yes, it killed all of my hair and when i move my fingers in my hair it makes a faint squeaky noise :) How about a salon?|`|iFORmz1Waa	If it's in good condition at the moment i'd say go for it and then leave off dying for another few months<br>  if it's already getting dry or brittle, take good care of it, don't straighten it, use loads of conditioner and leave it as long as you can bear before dying it again<br>  :]|`|su6wYQ3Taa	you normally have to wait 6-8 weeks before you dye your hair again. your hair will probly feel a little bit dead if you do dye it again but im sure if you dont do it often you can get away with it once.|`|wohGR1Nkaa	I bleached my hair from ginger to blonde and it went sunflower yellow and like straw.<br>  Then I dyed it with mini dye which didnt help.<br>  Then dyed it with permanat blonde serum.<br>  My hair was dry but I conditioned it alot :)<br>  It will be fine :)|`|CtjNURKiaa	ive had bleach, black, purple, red and brown dye on my hair and it's fine.|`|jkkCfu6Haa	just as long as its not out of the box cause it fryes your hairbut you'll do pretty well. :)|`|CdYvOnZqaa	no u r fine b/c i dyed mi hair 4 times and it is just as new..|`|0zBp2lMeaa	when u lighten ur hair it basically goes thought the color wheel and gold is they hardest to break well besides red . i would say ur best bet when ur go in lighter is go to a Professional. but if u want it lighter ur Polly gonna have to bleach. i don't even know if the stores sell toner. Plus it all depends on the level ur at. i would say don't leave the lightener on to long better to take it off then reapply if u think ur done also when the color is on test ur ends if u pull on them and they are like a rubber band take it off. and most of all do a deep conditioner after ur done no matter what u choose to do good luck|`|YAjmiDJraa	Be very careful while dying your hair a lot because my hair lady's daughter dyed hers 2 times in 2 weeks and it started to fall out. I think you're good though lol.|`|snGWtzX5aa	I would wait a little while, and then dye it back, meanwhile condition your hair as much as you possibly can.|`|gWdzwaCyaa	Go careful! <br>  <br>  If I'm at all worried about dying my hair I always opt for a semi because they are kinder to your hair, leave them with gloss look and feel and washes out eventually! <br>  <br>  TBH I always seek advice from my friend who is a hair dresser! If you know anybody who does hair ask them. <br>  <br>  If you can afford it (just for this time to make sure your hair ends up being the colour you want it to be) I'd spend a lil extra and go to a Professional Hair Dresser. <br>  <br>  However if you have to dye it yourself I went with Loreal Range, I trust this because Loreal surely know what they are doing? When looking at the self in Boots or Superdrug Loreal are the market leader<br>  <br>  Good Luck
ne2ltUKwaa	yeah, it would be better if you could post a pic. but my all time favourite hairstyle has to be this one....<br>  <a href="http://www.e4.com/skins/series3/pictures-thegang.html?decorator-index=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.e4.com/skins/series3/pictures...</a><br>  <br>  good luck with your hair :)<br>  x|`|5KdXVKrJaa	haha i got the same problem lol|`|PHkDtKcVaa	you would have to post pic of you so we can c how u look like. and go from there!|`|SllYPk8uaa	I used this website when I was looking for a new hairstyle. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairstylesdesign.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstylesdesign.com/</a>
3b2ecc694fa7536f10ef0b60f4c9c939aa	i think after like 2 days|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Whenever you like - its always vulnerable when bleached! Wear a hat and stick a load of conditioner on under that - and get a good chlorine removing shampoo.|`|WpqfQOTJaa	whenever you want. Why wouldn't it be safe to go swimming? Are you worried the bleach from your hair will wash out?<br>  <br>  Remember, when you bleached your hair, that permantly turned your hair blonde. The only way to get rid of your highlights now is to let it grow out. So swim all you want.|`|OUWTvtVVaa	Chlorine will strip color, but you can wear a cap to protect your hair.|`|oCJVZ1WCaa	Hmmm.. I dont know, I would give it a miss it might wreck your highlights and turn them a strange colour(:<br>  <br>  x|`|fXeqf3btaa	I would give it two weeks otherwise the chlorine is going to kill your hair!|`|d5504f49ed3dccc09579dcc68c3c9d18aa	Ha Ha Ha Ha...are you Irish?? go now and your hair will be a nice green tint!  All kidding aside, I'd be careful, the chlorine can do awfully damaging things to bleached hair at anytime!
Nc9CywDsaa	My sister once dyed her hair because she wanted streaks. Well the dye turned her hair orange. My sister has blond hair. My boss used to dye her own hair and it always turned out horrible!! My hairdresser has always told my sister never to dye her own hair. He doesn't believe that people should dye their own hair. He says that over the counter products will damage your hair. I think it doesn't mater what type of hair color that you have. If you don't dye your hair properly it could turn out horrible. I won't dye your own hair even if it was brown, black, etc. You need the right kind of dye for you hair. At a hair salon the hairdresser will chose the perfect color for your hair. They use special dyes that don't damage your hair. Your best bet is to save your money and visit a hairdresser!! You will be happy with the results!!!|`|yp8NtB0faa	I use Loreal hair dye. But if ur going to dye ur hair black it doesn't matter what brand becuz black covers anything.  And if u have a lot of hair get 2 boxes. I would wait until after u dye ur hair to cut ur bangs
f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	No, I think only at flagship stores. I have never seen mens clothes in the smaller regular shops.
k48N5SYuaa	Maybe a light copper brown might work|`|wrrKmlVuaa	well if your looking for a dramatic change I suggest you try darker colors......deep chocolate  with some goldenbrown highlights to light up your skin color.....if your looking for a small change try blonde with platinum blonde highlight ...but really brown is the color this season|`|Zg1v2qifaa	Red may work, but I don't know if it would suit your bright blue eyes. Because bright red suits green eyes better than blue. If you go for strawberry blonde or light auburn, that may work out better.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think a dark chocolate brown hair would be gorgeous. Not only would it contrast your pale skin, it would also compliment your pinkish cheeks and bright blue eyes. <br>  <br>  Alexis Bledel and Zooey Deschanel are great examples:<br>  <a href="http://images.askmen.com/galleries/actress/alexis-bledel/pictures/alexis-bledel-picture-5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.askmen.com/galleries/actre...</a><br>  <a href="http://img61.imageshack.us/img61/3159/delaneymm8.png" rel="nofollow">http://img61.imageshack.us/img61/3159/de...</a>|`|e7LztkqYaa	You can go ether red or blond hair or mixed.|`|FBnKUp7iaa	definetly blonde
J9Rgy02baa	I'm not a fan of the whole cross-dresser scene... but if you insist then no one on here's going to stop you, I might as well help.<br>  If you are going to wear a denim mini-skirt, first shave your legs. Please. Just wear cute shirts, layer with beaters to accent something on the shirt. If you want to get really into it, then go ahead and wear heals if you can... if not cute sneakers or flip flops. Just shop in the girls section at american eagle, hollister, abercrombie, wet seal etc...|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	That's something my friend would ask and at first I was like 'what?' B/c johnny would make sense for him if it was spelled jonny but not b/c either of you are cross dressers but because he's so rAndom. AHAHAH you aren't serious by the way...|`|7nrhPCf0aa	gay much????????????????????|`|7BkkZo9Kaa	You could get your self a nice tank top or a fitting tee.<br>  Should by some wedge heels too!<br>  <br>  well i hope the cross dressing works out|`|aa35e095a615d2c9fa9251d229a3968aaa	Get a nice little strappy top and some sandals to go with it. Don't forget to get some nice underwear too.|`|uZsmAn96aa	Well, ummmmmmmm, teal leggings and a white peasant blouse would look nice. Is it Spirit Week at school??|`|XCzpQvDvaa	hahaha this is golden|`|cMgcqhxnaa	Are you gay?... But anywayz U should wear leggings.. Unless you shave and Don't wear anything that shows your belly button it can get a little uncomfortable for everyone around you. Just wear a regular t- shirt Denim jacket?|`|Svum4Fssaa	everything goes with denim skirts. <br>  <br>  but seriously, wear a long one, joking aside..<br>  how old are you? have you considered sex change or are you just joking around?|`|rvMWXJSMaa	Uhm.<br>  Don't.<br>  It's odd and can make people feel extremely uncomfortable.<br>  Just wear cute men clothing. Lol.<br>  Skinny jeans and tight shirts for men are better then mini skirts FOR WOMEN.|`|obIMwp99aa	O.O get a sex change..|`|FnfHTOnaaa	yikes..off to korea with you|`|fbIhtNSdaa	um.....welll......<br>  <br>  sorry no comment|`|f3u036uCaa	ur gayyyyyyyyyyyy|`|jbpWAyMoaa	hmm depens on what look your going for, <br>  but tights and pumps with  cute t-shirt, zip up, hoodie, vest top or halter neck.<br>  you could also wear uggs or boots or high heels, trainers<br>  <br>  or no tights and flip flop <br>  <br>  but i wouldnt suggest you wear socks and bear legs witht he skirt.<br>  <br>  however you could go for a more savy look with knee highs and a button up shirt and jumper.|`|ZeA9zJwoaa	well it really depends on your build I guess... I mean if you have quite a small build, then maybe go with a nice patterned top from river island or new look, however if you are of a larger build maybe stick with a plain coloured top, primark usually have loads of these, or again new look. Im guessing you haven't had much experience in heels, so stick with flats or flip flops.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :).|`|cbOlhteiaa	Um stop people will call you a transvestite.|`|e0b974bbe460e82da50f1fa4f8a911e0aa	/troll
AA11557192	I know my feet are wide too.  <br>  <br>  I do not think you can do anything short of having foot surgery.  I did hear of someone that had her pinky toe removed.  That just seems disgusting.
wDnP5b0Oaa	stay away from yellows, whites, or bright pinks because a yellow and white would wash you out and a pink would make you look like barbie (sounds good but people will look at you like 'why would she do that' trust me I know from experience)  You could get a purple, green or blue one . And keep the blonde hair, it looks great on you.|`|uZsmAn96aa	A lavender or light pink would bring out your eyes nicely. My hair is the same color, and navy really makes it pop. If you have a lighter skin tone, stay away from white and the like unless you want a ghost thing going on. If you have more medium skin, just about any color will look good on you. If your skin tone is more on the golden side, white will make you look like a goddess, especially if your dress is flowy.|`|LZzsDARUaa	find  a dress that matches ur eyes...green with blue in it, like in  a combination<br>  <br>  <br>  I like this 1, the color at least<br>  <a href="http://www.mattiasfunwear.com/catalog/images/silk_long_green_blue_drss.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mattiasfunwear.com/catalog/im...</a>|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	white looks good on you<br>  but if you dont want a white prom dress...you could go with a light blue. or maybe even a purple|`|AA10451868	light blues, dark greens, and black.....|`|9JKigzKWaa	i wuld say bluess<br>  or prettier with ur aquas liek thsi:]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www2.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?DeptID=50455&CatID=54692&GrpTyp=PRD&ItemID=157ccda&attrtype=&attrvalue=&CMID=50455%7c51280&Fltr=&Srt=&QL=F&IND=8&CmCatId=50455|51280|54692" rel="nofollow">http://www2.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Dep...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www2.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?DeptID=50455&CatID=54692&GrpTyp=PRD&ItemID=157debc&attrtype=&attrvalue=&CMID=50455%7c51280&Fltr=&Srt=&QL=F&IND=15&CmCatId=50455|51280|54692" rel="nofollow">http://www2.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Dep...</a>|`|rvMWXJSMaa	Stay away from red.<br>  A light blue would be pretty.

5jsMY4RIaa	the only thing that i can think of is that if you tighten it waaaaayyyyyy too much you can crack a rib. But that's about it. Women wore them for 3 or 400 years and they all seemed fine. I love corsets, they're so pretty|`|0AQF8pnKaa	it can crack your rib cage if you tie it too tightly (you might have too to make the hourglass figure you want) also it can cut off blood circulation, and constrict your air ways. also, the hourglass figure is more of an 1800s thing, i think you would look fine without wearing a corset.|`|6PNuFgTJaa	It can cause severe pressure on the internal organs and bone structure. It can weaken the muscles in your chest because you have small room to breathe if the corset is tied too tight.|`|pkUGWcevaa	the pain and it's not natural for your body to be shaped like that. for posture there's this tape that goes on ur back and it really helps. also, you can't really breath.|`|AEAxZEveaa	As long as you're not tightening it like the victorians did (can't breathe, breaking ribs, etc.), I think you'll be fine.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	You can never achieve an hourglass figure with a corset. It'll just make you look thinner than you are. You will have the same structure though. Wearing a corset is not dangerous unless you start hyperventilating.<br>  <br>  To the idiot below me:<br>  A corset was not the reason of death back then. It was the lack of medical technology. Most people died from disease and starvation. Mostly the poor, which didn't wear them, died. The rich died from from disease but it was more rare than the common folk. And a corset doesn't squish you insides.  Your kidneys are in too deep for them to be affected. Like I said before unless you are breathing heavy then you are fine. Just don't tighten it too much or you will create a shortness of breathe.<br>  <br>  Edit <br>  Read this and you will see it is not harmful. <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ther_over/harmful.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/ther_over/harmf...</a><br>  This is actually proven. Its not just a bunch of people, who don't know what they are talking about, ranting on about how it is not good for you.<br>  <br>  Edit again!!!!<br>  Guys extreme corseting was never and will never be common. That is what you guys are describing.  Some women did that because they were extremely self conscious about their figure. Stop basing your idiotic ideas based on a few women.|`|g7aeECInaa	well first figuire out the right way to put on a corset. There are about 60 ways to put it on wrong and bout two ways to put it on right.<br>  If you put it on wrong you may not be able to breath correctly and faint<br>  perhaps die if you aren't getting enough air.<br>  as for your posture and figuire it may and may not help. It will probably help your posture though.|`|4ZQTsbiaaa	a corset? do research about victorian corsets. continued use os very bad for the internal organs. <br>  <br>  "Extremely tight lacing of a corset could lead to fainting and headaches, or even to internal organ damage,"|`|7a359d5049aba404f11c59558c1cde58aa	well, wearing corsets were one of the common reasons why a lot girls died back  in the day.<br>  wearing corsets basically squishes your waists and basically everything else inside you..<br>  like your lungs & kidneys and stuff..<br>  making it kind of hard for you to breathe.<br>  <br>  i dont reccomend it but if you want to wear it, dont use it so tight.|`|GiRQpMteaa	First of all. why are you wearing a corset.

They do especially lovely greens and blues!<br>  <br>  Check in your magazines because there are often coupons, which grocery stores will double and you can score the kits for cheap.<br>  <br>  Also, they are the best drugstore brand for doing smokey eyes! Especially their navy blue/sand combo.|`|MV1l9yGIaa	I'm a grey and bluish person when it comes to eyeshadow. You have to go with the color best suited for your eyes. As far as loreal, you could get a nice shadow from Maybelle or cover girl for less.|`|a1KT2SQlaa	they are ok but I would rather spend the extra $4 on mac. save your money and get milani i think hip and milani are the exact same but one is way cheaper than the other! the blushes are great too!|`|lu4ufhm5aa	I tried a HIP eye shadow and one of the newish covergirl eye enhancer shadow.. yea I like HIP alot better. good luck|`|diYZ4Maraa	I have the "Gilded" color, which is a gold and green.  It looks really fantastic on, and stays on all day.  I've had comments on how great it looks!  I definitely recommend.|`|y0bZVJAoaa	omgggggggg soooooooooooooooo gooodddddd i love them i have every color loreal is the mother company of mac shhh its a secret !
5jsMY4RIaa	forever? i don't think they have experation dates. They're non-perishables.|`|pw3y3Eo0aa	forever it has no exasperation date<br>  it never gets old|`|agANMF77aa	check expiry date<br>  that is usually best indication even once opened<br>  other than that, i d say until its smells funky|`|x4NcoGjmaa	untill its gone!
