Refunds for credit card transactions are processed within 45 working days."      My request for refund was filed July 3, 2008, and now is way past the 45 working days limit.. the amount has not been credited yet to my card.      I was thinking, I would have better chances of getting action asap, by building a coalition of disgruntled passengers that have the same issue. I see lots of them posting in internet forums.  So what is the best course of action I take?

20090220224825AAAdWjQ	Travel;United States;Honolulu	First Hawaii Vacation for 20-something year olds?	I want to go to Hawaii for my 25th birthday, as this is one destination I've never been to but I'm dying to visit. Tentatively, I'm planning to go with a few people who I haven't seen in awhile (24/25 year olds), and having no idea where to stay or what to do, I would be most grateful for some guidance.       A little about us: we are young professionals, who have the disposable income to have a good time, but not to the point of where we want to go into debt. We look for quality, but not the point of requiring to stay in a 4 or 5-star hotel, but somewhere decently luxurious to retreat to. We are craving sun, lying on the beach, reading good books, and sipping on tropical drinks. At night, we hope to enjoy fine dining and the hot spots most young adults visit.         With this in mind...       - What is the best month to visit Hawaii? My birthday is in the fall, but willing to travel whenever best advised. I am thinking spring/summer, but any suggested months?      - What island/city would you recommend for a first time Hawaii visitor? What's not to miss, or what's to avoid?      - Any hotel/resort/condo recommendations (names would be helpful)? Looking for a place that's accessible to relaxing beaches, nightlife/dining, and shopping. Don't want to stay somewhere too kid-friendly, but also not too chill where we're the youngest guests...      Any advice would be most appreciated. Thank you!!

20090220234132AAAOpxt	Travel;United States;Los Angeles	If you lived in LA and were turning 33 what would you want to do for your birthday?	My dad's fiancee's birthday is coming up and I want to do something really special for her, but I'm not sure what ladies her age would want to do. She's a lot younger and much, much hipper and more adventuresome than my parents, and I want to treat her to something she would really think was awesome. She goes to Burke Williams & Bliss fairly often, so I don't think a spa day would be special enough. I thought about taking her up to the wineries in Santa Barbara but I'm not sure if they'd let me even let me in (I wouldn't taste, I'd just hang out with her) because I'm 17. Does anybody know? They've gone up to the Firestone & Curtis wineries with friends and they liked it.      If you have any other suggestions that would be great. I don't want to just take her to dinner - my dad is going to to that - I want us to have a lot of fun and to spend the day together. She likes me, and I know she will want to if I can figure out what to do. I have about $120 I could spend.       So please give me some ideas. Thx in adv. : )

20090221002305AAKIGg8	Travel;India;Other - India	What are the reasons of backwardness of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar?	Since the independence, Utter Pradesh has privilege to rule the country, as Jawaharlal Lal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi and Rajeev Gandhi served the country as Prime Minister for a long time. But they did almost nothing for the development of this region. This is also a fact the regional political leaders never raised the issue of development seriously. State governments also can’t escape from their responsibility. BJP played “Babri Masjid Card and came in power to employed the sentiments of people but they too did nothing even for Faizabad/Ayodhya. People of this region are economically backward and migrating to other states to work as labor. Maharashtra says “ Bhaiya” go out from Maharashtra. What is the future of these states? According to a news article in TOI dated February 19, 2009, five Indian states-Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala-account for almost 69% of the country's engineering graduates, indicating that these states also have most of India's engineering colleges, whereas states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Orissa together account for a measly 14% of India's technological colleges. This is causing worry among educationists about a regional imbalance creeping in. The people of these regions are also responsible for their poverty due to lack of awareness about development.. Wake up… it is not too late to take positive action for the development of your region. Vote for development and not on any other issue.

20090220235753AAFD7Z2	Travel;United States;New York City	How much is a fine in New York?	My husband is a truck driver and had a load going to New York, we are from Kentucky. Anyway, he was lost and was trying to find the customers address and somehow completely MISSED seeing a stop sign! Now before you think badly of him, he has had a PERFECT record, no tickets, fines or warnings in all the time he has driven, both before he received his CDLs and afterwards, this is the FIRST violation ever for him, OK? I mean, he is an ANAL driver! lol      Anyway, he was in Hastings on Hudson, NY (Westchester County) and was pulled over and issued a citation for disregarding a stop sign. I've called the Clerk's office and the police station and both said that since we're in Kentucky, it wouldn't be feasible for us to run into New York for the court date to pay the fines and all that, etc., etc. And that on the back there was a place for him to check "Guilty" and to sign it and mail it in to the Clerk, or whoever it will be going to. Well, my husband is coming home in about an hour and we're going to be doing that. They said that when they received the ticket and it was signed and marked Guilty that they would then send a payment request. OK, all fine, well and good. My question is, how much will the ticket cost us? I'm too impatient to wait for a payment request to find out! Could anyone possibly answer for me? And also, will this affect my husbands points on his license? And does this count as a conviction? And if so, how long does it take to be taken off of his license? Please ANYONE who can help, PLEASE HELP! lol      Thanks for your time and hopefully, not being rude to my question!
