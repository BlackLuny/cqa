6HO9NIuUaa	I was in almost the same shoes as you recently and so was a buddy of mine.  We have a little slower processor than you but that's about it. I too was running XP SP3 and was offered a free copy of Vista from my college computer store.<br>  <br>  My friend decided to upgrade, and I did not.  Now his computer starts up much slower than it used to and he also has to click "continue" whenever he wants to perform any operation on his computer. Vista looks much nicer and may be more secure (although it still has tons of holes just like XP) but it requires a lot more memory to just perform basic tasks like start up!  Now 2 gigs of ram is right on the cusp of being acceptable but if I were you I would hold off until you either get more ram, or until windows 7 comes out.<br>  <br>  That said, Microsoft kind of has you by the you-know-whats and is forcing a lot of people to upgrade by releasing games that ONLY run on vista.  Spore, new COD, Halo when it comes out, all of them will be on Vista and Vista only.  Hang onto XP as long as you can until you need vista to play the game you want.|`|HtfqFgEgaa	XP SP2 only! Best resolution , easy to find programs , no loading issues with (UAC) , and most of all there is no problem changing programs or removing programs. XP SP3 is out because you can't use Internet Explorer 8 RC1.|`|iRSqsJYuaa	IF you have an x86 Intel Pentium processor get Windows XP. If you have an x64 processor go ahead and get vista. Because the x64 can better handle all the resources that vista WILL eat up. an x86 will be slower if you choose vista. Besides, vista is really only good for looks and a few extra features it has over Xp. Xp won't give you any problems.|`|5WFpf3IVaa	Get both, dual boot vista and xp, that way if you don't like vista you can delete after wards. I have almost the same specs on my laptop except it has 1GB RAM and yet vista still runs fast.|`|P03cnAIbaa	so wat you are wanting to do stick with XP yes vista is nice but if your not familiar with it , it can be a little confusing.<br>  <br>  but for what ur going to be doing stay with XP|`|AA11147622	Get a MAC instead!|`|tompYXFRaa	Vista will probably be more laggy.<br>  XP Will be more customizable, faster and stabler.<br>  There still are bugs in vista which aren't solved though in XP almost all are solved.<br>  <br>  Vista lagged for me on a 3.4Ghz pc sometimes so I don't recommend it.<br>  Conclusion: Use XP!|`|5dNY5Jy0aa	With 2gb ram I'd probably stick with XP, I like vista better but I don't think I'd go through the trouble of upgrading to it under any circumstance if I had XP on a computer already.  Vista also takes up a decent amount more memory to run which could hurt everything else you're doing|`|3c8f4e75997fa4e2743ad3bbb5cf864baa	I'd stick with XP till Windows 7 is finished with Beta testing.

Both are traits of an Object. You don't have an Object until java sees the keyword 'new' in a line of code. 'new' evokes the constructor of a class and builds the Object and throws it on the computer heap. java would have used the class variables for defining traits for the Object.

AA11434745	You're not clear on what specifically you want to do with Publisher that has to do with ASP.NET.<br>  <br>  The short answer is that Publisher has the ability to handle Web forms automatically. To do so, it requires the Web server to have installed FrontPage extensions. If your Web server runs ASP.NET, then you probably are using IIS, which has the ability to install FrontPage extensions on your site through the Internet Services manager.<br>  <br>  ASP.NET itself has nothing to do with Publisher.

Most likely, your friend did not rip the cd that you bought, because this torrent was last updated on the 28th of October of last year, so I would have to wonder why you bought a game 5 months ago and are just now trying to figure out how to play it?<br>  <br>  Totally bogus, but good story.

The .iso is an image file. Basically, it's like having a virtual copy of the physical CD on your computer, so you have 1 of about 2 choices.<br>  <br>  1.

To do this, just open the image in powerISO and look for an icon that says "Burn" at the top somewhere on the menu bar.<br>  <br>  Leave most of the options as they are, but I would set burn speed to the lowest (4x) for a good burn.

There’s a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (<a href="http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)</a> – click on the “Troubleshooting” link.  Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.

beQolBQJaa	DiTX, just to make things clear, the number you see in your torrent client under the Seeds column is 2(200) or 200(XXXX). If your situation is the first one you are only connected to 2 seeders (not to 200). If the situation is 200(XXXX) then yes you are connected to 200 seeders.<br>  In the first case if there are only 2 seeders then those are supplying the torrent to all leechers at the moment (well actually other leechers contribute too) and whatever their speed is the amount uploaded by them is spread among all leechers and that's why you get so little. Another reason could be that those seeders are uploading a good number of other torrents and their upload speed is divided among those meaning that they only upload a little of every torrent they have and again you only get a little.<br>  If your case is the second one you should have better downloading speed. Check the flags those seeders have, every time you see a capital "D" it means that seeder is uploading to you, a lower case "d" means that for any reason that seeder even connected to you doesn't want to upload to you (it could be he has the torrent paused or stopped).<br>  That's what comes to my mind.<br>  Best Regards!|`|C9coCm9kaa	Yes it could be the site u are using but most likely it is a ratio issue.If u have d/led alot more than u have uploaded than u are last on the list to get good speeds(so to speak) General rule is that when u d/l a movie lets say ...u then upload it back until your upload ratio is higher than your d/l ratio...Utorrent is the best for speeds(in my opinion)hope that made sense to u and good luck :)|`|k1xUyu1iaa	depends on what site u are using, your isp and what time of day it is.

You need something like a NVidia Quadro (or the ATI equivalent) card that may cost thousands of dollars.<br>  <br>  For editing, a normal 512 card will work because it's the processing that counts, but rendering. That's a whole nother thing.<br>  <br>  Stay away from Gamers cards as these are OK but, not for a professional.  For what you want to do, the same applies to good CAD work.  You could start by looking at AutoDesk's website and video card requirements for ideas.<br>  <br>  Cheers!<br>  <br>  edit: Let me make it clear, I did intensive video CAD work on high end workstations with Professional cards.  I have also done the same on machines with lesser cards.  There is no comparison.  For professional work, you NEED professional cards.<br>  <br>  edit2:  You're better off with the splitter.  Adding a second card will confuse the computer unless you build yourself a dedicated workstation that can handle switching of video cards or running separate cards in parallel.<br>  <br>  edit3:  Let me make it clear again, gamer cards using SLI or crossfire are not in the same league as a professional card.|`|8QWr77YZaa	Yes it is heavily involved with compiling and rendering.

I mean the 12gb of ram will almost be useless on the video side..<br>  <br>  I have no idea what your budget is, but here are your options.<br>  <br>  The GTX 295 is nvidias 1.725 gb ddr3 graphics card, its performance outweighs the ati hd4870x2 for games and programs of this day.<br>  <br>  Ati has moved to ddr5, the only problem is no games or programs take much use of that unless you are using a ginormous screen.<br>  <br>  Back to the point, you can sli 2x gtx 295 and have about 3.4 gb of vid ram that runs faster than 4gb of ddr5 (as of now).<br>  <br>  Or you can get crossfire ati hd4870x2.<br>  <br>  The point is, 256mb and 512 mb are not what you are looking for in a new computer for compiling and rendering video as it is a very graphical card intensive activity.

(Interrupt Request) There should be a tool in there to check and resolve IRQ conflicts. If there isnt an automatic tool then make sure everything is on a different address. Its pretty self explanatory once you see it. You may have to change say IRQ 15 to IRQ 7. I think you will understand once you see it.|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	Ok, you are going to have to provide more details.<br>  <br>  What operating system do you have?<br>  <br>  What computer do you have?<br>  <br>  Does it just shut off? <br>  <br>  or does it give you a warning that it will shut off?

Tm3ItIuvaa	I used MySpace when I was like 8 or something and I did not get in trouble. Just hide it from your parents, that's all (and if parents know just pretend they do not know)|`|IfzSyw6naa	It is down to the parents to monitor what their children are accessing on the internet. If parents don't set up adequate security then of course children are going to visit social networking sites. The names of some sites are heard nearly every day either in newspapers or on television so it doesn't take a genius to find them.|`|UXcr0YXuaa	It is the parent's responsibility.  Do not let your kids have an internet connected computer in their room.  One that is just for homework or playing games from cd-rom or whatever is fine, but no internet.  Have the computer that is connected to the internet in a place where a parent or adult often in (i.e. kitchen, living room, family room) and not in the office or computer room which is off on it's own.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's the site's responsibility at all - I think the only thing they could do to stop children joining, is if a credit card needed to be entered at sign up, which I'm sure, many children would just "use" their parents.<br>  <br>  And simply enough, many parents do not care enough or think it is important to take these steps since their child won't be one of the ones that goes missing while meeting in real life, a "14 year old girl" they met online.<br>  <br>  And one more thing, having "security" measures on your computer doesn't do anything.  You can disable and uninstall certain programs, you can block some sites, but all your child has to do is go to one of the many proxy sites out there and that will allow them to bypass any internet restrictions you've set out for them (site restrictions anyway).|`|t1YBJQIHaa	Good Question ! Parents should be more aware of what their children go on. Some people may not know but half of the People on myspace are 11 and below.

g62ATenqaa	Your first answerer is on the right tracks, you do need an IF function, but you need another parameter. Using =if(L4="",0) will produce zero in M4 if L4 is blank but it will produce #REF! if there is something else in M4.  With IF functions you have to say what happens if a cell meets the criteria, which in this case is the 0 if M4 is blank, but you also have to say what happens if it does not meet that criteria.  You do not say what you want to happen in that event, but assuming you want it blank the function would be =if(L4="",0,"") so this is saying if M4 has nothing in, return the value zero in M4, if it has anything else, leave M4 blank.|`|UT3iOmA8aa	Webdesign Tips And Tricks<br>  <a href="http://freshbloger.com/" rel="nofollow">http://freshbloger.com/</a>|`|11hhoUNGaa	Webdesign Tips And Tricks<br>  <a href="http://freshbloger.com/" rel="nofollow">http://freshbloger.com/</a>|`|XC2tl7u3aa	if an if statement..<br>  <br>  =if(l4="",0)

BuvQ8tuuaa	I think computers will turn back into "dumb terminals" like they used to be.  You can already get software online that lets you format USB jump drives and they are large enough now that you could install your OS onto the stick.  If the desktop has a BIOS that allows booting from a USB jump drive, then your "computer" is actually the stick--you carry it with you in your pocket wherever you go.<br>  <br>  There has also been a recent breakthrough in metaresistors, circuit elements that "remember" their state when power is removed.  When power is restored, they immediately return to their previous state.

The problem with SEO now is that because it's a huge industry, it has collected a HUGE population of cheap and disgraceful SEO "companies". If they say they have "secrets" in SEO, it pretty much labels them as inexperience or they deal in black hat techniques. SEO is not a secret, the process is simple, yet having an experienced optimizer and team is the real problem. The process of SEO is simple in terms, but to actually do the work is difficult. Always remember this quote "content is king, links are queen".<br>  <br>  In order to start a successful SEO plan, the site must be SEO friendly. In many cases the site is not which is why the first month of SEO is critical. We need to go into your site and make it SEO friendly by changing content, changing coding, and removing any issues that will not allow the search engine spiders to fully read your site.<br>  <br>  Now if your site is using Javascript/flash it's more than likely whoever created your site isn't experienced enough to make it SEO friendly. We then have to rewrite the coding to make it SEO friendly on top of the normal work we need to do anyway. (This is why the real professional SEO firms have a set up fee).<br>  <br>  Now that you have a SEo friendly site, it shows you have the base of your plan. You then must continue a monthly management of building QUALITY links, and updating the back source code to the search engines criteria. Now there are many factors to creating a successful optimization plan but that is the work that is done. Of course off page optimization helps your SEO plan (blogs, white pages, social media, etc). <br>  <br>  Just remember this, if the price of your SEO plan is cheap it's more than likely you're dealing with a bad seo company. You really do get what you pay for simply because SEO firms include the price of links into the budget. An experienced optimizer will not work for less than 5k a month UNLESS they are signed on with a company. But even a reputable firm will not go lower than $1,000.00 a month UNLESS the keywords you're aiming for are easy without much competition.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just remember if the price is low around 100-500 and the keywords are broad like "real estate, furniture, etc) then you're getting ripped off and you will not see results.<br>  <br>  If you have any further questions let me know.|`|RjUWPz5daa	There are many different ways and most companies won't actually divulge HOW they're doing it.<br>  <br>  Check out this article, it may help.|`|rT9Krkboaa	he would probably make sure you are using the correct keywords/keyword density for your site content etc, and make sure the site works correctly<br>  im sure that different search engines use different keyword ratios for content and the formula is a secret to each one.......<br>  probably wrong lol

They will issue with an SSL certificate, which you can give to your web hosting company.  They will then install it, and enable the HTTPS service.<br>  <br>  Of course if you run your own webserver then you can just do it all yourself :)<br>  <br>  Edit:  Epic Penguin is wrong; anyone can apply for a certificate if they're willing to pay for it.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	...

jUu3bBYHaa	I'm assuming that by an "educational" laptop, you mean a laptop that isn't designed for game playing.  If I'm wrong, please disregard.  Otherwise, you have several options.  <br>  <br>  1. Netbook ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook</a> ) : Netbooks are a new style of computer.  They have a solid state hard drive ( think a flash drive rather than the traditional rotating disk ), which has both positive and negative aspects.  They're significantly smaller than a traditional laptop physically, but typically run the usual operating systems ( Windows and Linux, though I think Apple has one out as well ).  My local Target store has them available in Windows and Linux, for about 300 dollars <br>  Target link : <a href="http://tiny.cc/xGJUl" rel="nofollow">http://tiny.cc/xGJUl</a><br>  <br>  2. Traditional laptop<br>  <br>  3. Tablet PC : This is what I use for class.  Mine looks like a traditional pc, but the screen has the ability to flip around and lay flat.  It's a touchscreen, so I use it to hand write notes into a program ( usually Microsoft Office OneNote, which often has great [free] trial offers for students ).  Mine was purchased at Circuit City a year ago for $850.<br>  Amazon link : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=dp_brlad_entry?ie=UTF8&node=1232597011" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=dp_brlad_ent...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  The advantages of using a computer for school are many.  There's no worry about losing important pages of notes ( which I'm prone to do ).  It's extremely convenient to find additional information on current topics.  All of your work is contained in one place ( though it's highly, HIGHLY recommended to have everything backed up somewhere else ) , and it's physical size doesn't change because you've written hundreds of pages of notes. <br>  <br>  You will probably have to watch out for distractions when using it though (I'm addicted to Freecell and have to use Temptation Blocker [ <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/temptblocker/" rel="nofollow">http://sourceforge.net/projects/temptblo...</a> ] while in class ). <br>  <br>  Hope that was helpful!

OcovssgKaa	An interesting article. It seems as Mr. Ballmer has changed his tune somewhat. Remember he once described Linux as being a 'cancer' within the software industry.

ww6nm7gfaa	I'm a military brat. My father was in the Air Force (retired now), and since the AF is flying planes all the time, they sometimes have unused space on the plane that they let military members ride on. This is called Space Available. Now, they have a system for who gets to ride in the space available, it is essentially a multiple priority queue. Everyone wishing to ride goes into the queue, but if you have a medical condition, ie the flight will be used for medical purposes, you have the highest priority, and get the first space in the plane. Then there are a series of other criteria, I don't recall what they all are, probably official trips go next, then officers go next, then enlisted, then dependents. For each of these, their order within their priority is based on various other criteria. For us, dependents, it would be how many times we had used it before, if we had taken a trip like a month ago, we would be lower priority than someone who hadn't used it in a year, so that more people get a chance to use it. There are other criteria too, but I don't remember how it went, it got a little complicated.|`|sB38LHKRaa	a lift in a building

Your BAT command >> will only append to the end of the file (I believe).  You need a way to find the proper place first and then delete the current entry and replace it with another.  What you are trying to do requires a different approach.  Download a program I think is called "Quick Keys".  You can program it to lean your keystrokes.  Including your file menu selections.  You can then program one of its keys to do all the work for you.  Open the file, go to edit, find, delete, replace with the text you want.<br>  <br>  UPDATE!!! i found the following BATCH code at <a href="http://www.computing.net/answers/programming/find-and-replace-text-in-batch-file/12413.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.computing.net/answers/program...</a><br>  <br>  For /F "tokens=1,2 delims==" %%A in (%1) Do (<br>  Echo %%A=%%B>> %1.tmp<br>  If "%%A"=="database" (<br>  Echo destination=300>> %1.tmp))<br>  Move %1.tmp %1<br>  <br>  Try that in your BAT file.

YkZvPORhaa	Well, if you're just getting started, it's generally easiest to familiarize yourself with the tools and filters, and what each one does. If you want to create digital paintings, the paintbrush and its settings menu will be your biggest friend. If you're more interested in photo editing, you'd probably want to practice using the healing brush and filters.<br>  <br>  Basically, though, it just takes practice. There are plenty of websites that can help you get started. My favorite is psd.tutsplus.com, because they update frequently and have lots of simple projects that can teach you quite a bit.

RQdFRaANaa	Computers do not always store one file in one location. Say you have a large file (a long MP3 or a video file), and the computer has an open space for half of it. It will put half in that open space and the other half at the hard drive. Hence the file is “frag”mented. This is normal and happens all the time. However if a computer gets too fragmented the hard drive has to spend all its time jumping from one part to the next. This slows things down.|`|13b723f270d65c013797b5d13e3884adaa	when a drive writes something, it will usually begin at the first open sector.  However, if the file/files it is writing is too large to be written to consecutive sectors (like there is another file in the way) it will append the files to the next available sector.

LWeF5LWdaa	No easy answer for this question, sorry....  Wikipedia is a moving target, and it's difficult to pin it down long enough to collect this sort of information.<br>  <br>  The latest complete database dump of the English Wikipedia (completed 31 March 2008) is 147.7GB when compressed in BZ2 format and 3.1GB in the 7-Zip format.  The uncompressed version could be up to twenty times the BZ2 size and one hundred times the 7-Zip size, so the core database at that time could have been up to ~3TB of text (without images or other uploaded files).<br>  <br>  There have been a *lot* of revisions in the past year, though, so the current core database for the English Wikipedia is undoubtedly quite a bit larger.  Once you factor in the databases for images and other uploaded files, it's unlikely that you'd be able to fit the whole thing on your home computer.|`|6303924aca31975d4efe5df45761b87caa	At the present time, all of Wikipedia, including edit histories, photos, and audio files, comprises less than 5 terabytes of storage.

AA10330482	In linux, there is more than one standard for windowing interfaces.  There are several popular "Desktop Environments" - GNOME, KDE, and XFCE.  Your best bet is to create a theme for one or all three of these.  From the slax website, it looks like KDE is the one they package by default, so go with a custom KDE environment.<br>  <br>  Note that changes made to window colors, fonts, etc., will only apply to programs that make use of KDE's widgets.  Otherwise, you may have to go program by program to change each one's look and feel.

GMS1oIdIaa	These are the 100 most cool apps in face book: <br>  <br>  These apps are the most popular ones. But others are useful, innovative and praiseworthy. Whether you’re a Facebook veteran or newbie, you should find something worth adding.<br>  <br>  1. Fantasy Record Label. Created by Music 2.0 firm Amie Street, this lets you discover music by bands you’ve never heard of, then add five of them to your virtual record label, getting points if other people like ‘em too. Get it<br>  <br>  2. Super Smash Bros. Someone’s remade the classic Nintendo GameCube game for Facebook, just in time for the all-new Wii version to come out. Get it<br>  <br>  3. WarBook (pictured). Another game, but this one’s exclusive to Facebook, and is a medieval strategy game, with monsters and gold and stuff. Nerdy, but ace. Get it<br>  <br>  4. Bob Dylan. Celebrate the Bobcat’s new album with his official Facebook app. See, even gravel-voiced old fellas are down with the Facebook massive… Get it<br>  <br>  5. LOLCats. Silly cats, sillier captions, ON UR PROFILE, MAYKIN U LAFF. Get it<br>  <br>  6. FunWall. Because a boring old un-fun Wall won’t cut the mustard any more. Get it<br>  <br>  oktoberfest.gif7. Oktoberfest Party (pictured). Invite your friends to a virtual Oktoberfest and get smashed on virtual beer. Yes, I’d rather do it for real too. Get it<br>  <br>  8. My Music.

Champions League Predictor. Guess how wrong Benitez’s rotation policy will go, and win the respect of your peers. Get it<br>  <br>  10. YouTube Video Box. Forget spamming friends with endless links to comedy YouTube vids. You can put ‘em in your profile instead! Get it<br>  <br>  11. Free gifts. Why pay to send a frivolous Facebook gift when you can get them for free? Apart from seeming like a moany old Web 2.0 skinflint, obviously. Get it<br>  <br>  12. Cities I’ve Visited. Another way to boast about how well-travelled you are. Get it<br>  <br>  13. My Graveyard. Like the famous My Aquarium application, except with less fish, and more pumpkins, zombies and Satans. Get it<br>  <br>  14. Beer Pong. No, this isn’t about how you smell when waking up in the gutter after a heavy night out. Instead, it’s a game involving a ball, and cups of beer. Waste of good beer if you ask me. Get it<br>  <br>  15. Beastie Boys. They’ve got a new album out! It’s not as good as their old stuff! But they have a Facebook App anyway! Get it<br>  <br>  16. Fmail. Access your Gmail from Facebook - an amazing idea, at least until Google get round to making an official Gmail app. Get it<br>  <br>  17. The Official 100 Question Hipster Test.

Oh, and the one who has most time to spend making comparisons on internetweb sites, obviously. Get it<br>  <br>  22. GlitterBox. Send sparkly messages to your mates. Look, you may laugh, but there are millions of Claire’s Accessories customers who’d jump at the chance. Get it<br>  <br>  23. My Solar System. Like My Aquarium or My Graveyard, but with planets and rockets and stuff. Brian May has this, I bet. Get it<br>  <br>  24. Blind Date. Nothing to do with Cilla Black (sadly): instead, this lets you hook up anonymously with anyone on Facebook, have a short conversation in which you have nothing in common, and then stare awkwardly at the floor. Before poking them anyway. Get it<br>  <br>  25. My Prison Name. I always thought it was ‘*****’, no matter what your sex / age / crime. Apparently not. Get it<br>  <br>  26. Cute Horoscopes.

If you use the Nike+ iPod software, this app lets you publish details of your recent runs on your Facebook profile. No more pretending you slogged through an 18 mile hike when in fact you got tired by the corner shop and sloped home with a packet of ciggies instead. Get it<br>  <br>  30. Interactive Friends Graph. Because everyone’s friends look better as a colourful flowchart. Get it<br>  <br>  31. Hatching Eggs. More gifts for friends, this time in shells. Get it<br>  <br>  32. Friend Block. Create a

KGBBSsVfaa	Sure, there's a lot of ways! You could burn all your data to CD's or DVD's and then just copy the data back on to the new one, or you could get an external hard drive and copy all the data to it, then hook it up to the new one and copy it back to it, or you could network the 2 computers together and send the data over the network to the new computer. If you're not really tech savvy, I'd suggest using removable media (DVD, CD) to do it or with a USB or Firewire external hard drive, as networking them can be a little difficult if you don't know what you're doing. But either way you go, keep in mind you only need to copy your personal files, you don't need to copy any of the system files as they will already be on the new one and be updated to be current. You might also want to take any applications you have that don't come with the new one, which you can just reload from the install CD's you have, or if you don't have install CD's for them, you can copy over all the application parts and reload them on the new one. <br>  <br>  The last thing you could do is get an external hard drive case, they run about $20-$50 at stores like Bestbuy or Staples, and remove the hard drive from your old computer, place it inside the external case, and hook it up to the new computer so you literally have all your data accessible on your new machine. Whatever you do, good luck and enjoy the new machine!|`|Dvfb4DZKaa	get an external hard drive and drag all items of your choice to it. then, plug it into your new pc. then, you're done.|`|rhTvEus6aa	flash drives, hard drives, cd's, etc|`|VtnwtXtFaa	yes flash drives...external hard drives..or cd's|`|hKVc3Uc2aa	If your old computer have Ethernet card built in, u just need a cable to connect your PCs into a LAN!!!|`|xMqgB2GDaa	You have to remove the old hard drive and hook it up to the new one. You didn't say if either one was a laptop or a desktop, so the process is a little different for each. I'll admit, doing it for a laptop requires the purchase of an enclosure or adapter ($20-80). This is if the old machine is not functioning.<br>  <br>  If the old one works, get a CROSSOVER cable. It looks like an ethernet cable, but one of the four twisted pairs inside is flipped (the transmit/receive cables). DO NOT USE A CROSSOVER FOR INTERNET.

This means that the computer does not know what the device is. Right-click on the device and choose "Update driver software". From there, direct Windows to your unzipped folder containing the drivers; it will do the rest.<br>  <br>  If you don't see any conflicts (!s), you probably don't need to install anything extra. However, if you're sure something isn't working because of invalid drivers, you can simply find it on the list, follow the same steps above, and install it.<br>  <br>  Another quick solution (if you can get online) is to run Windows Update, as it might download the necessary drivers for you.

If it's damage they won't cover, you've just busted your computer for the fun of it.<br>  <br>  My recommendation is to man up and take care of your stuff.

itBRFtwnaa	the 2:10 is your FSB to memory ratio. on my computer, my FSB is 200 MHz and my memory is at 400 MHz (it is actually 800 MHz since it is dual channel) 2:10 (or 1:5) would mean that your CPU FSB is running at 176 MHz since 176*5= 880. then 880*2 = 1760 to get your final RAM speed. then you would take you 176 CPU FSB and multiply it by whatever your CPU multplier is to get your fianl CPU clock speed. The ratios vary depending on what your stock ram speed is. like is said, my FSB is 200 and MY ram is 800 so my ratio would be 1:2. if my stock ram speed were 1066 it would be 1:5.33 or something to that effect. hope this helps and happy overclocking!

Dreamweaver is much easier to use, and it will put the revised pages on the server for you. Personally, I use Notepad, but you have to be very comfortable with HTML to do that, so you're probably better off starting with a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) program like Dreamweaver. FrontPage will work if that's what you have. One suggestion: be careful with your color choices. On the Firefighter's Prayer page, for example, the bold red type against the black background is a bit hard on the eyes. Also, the Creation of the Firefighter section goes right out to the edges; I would put it in a table with an 80% width, centered, and then left-align the text within it.|`|cA3PAgetaa	websites are made using html coding, some programs, like microsoft frontpage, are very helpful in creating websites, they work like a word processer and write the coding themselves, if you have frontpage available, I'd recommend using that.

zGPaH7tjaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Are you running Windows 2000/XP/Vista. If you are then you could use antivirus advance. I bought from them 2 months ago. They seem fine. because I download tons of movies, I needed a good virus protector. This did very well. It detected viruses before my Norton did! Visit the link to antivirus advance in the source box below. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|9kfjIRLyaa	I like Norton Internet security. It won't slow down your computer, even when using photoshop.

KGaH6faIaa	If your computer video card supports it, it may have come with a component video splitter cable, or an S-video out. You can use that to display your movies on your TV.<br>  <br>  For sound you can get a 3.5mm jack to RCA converter cable, and plug one end to your computer's soundcard output and the other end to the TV.|`|VtnwtXtFaa	Computer to TV connections almost universally disappoint in the end. They can work well for things like using a large screen TV for presentations, but TVs are not suitable replacements for monitors. Especially if you're using S-video as the connection mode, since s-video has a maximum resolution of about 576i, or a standard PAL resolution.<br>  However, if you insist on learning off of this yourself, you need to poke around in the video card settings and make sure the s-video output is enabled. On some cards you can only have output on one mode or the other. So if you enable s-video output, your monitor will no longer receive any input. This will likely change the resolution of your desktop and screw up icon placements and several other things.<br>  If you're looking to make something of a home theater setup, don't use a computer with s-video to do it. Spend the money to get some set atop box or a computer designed to be a home theater system. If you want to use it as a monitor, don't even bother with s-video as your only option. If you were using VGA/DVI/HDMI/Component connections... Then it might work for specific situations. Any other uses probably aren't worth it either.<br>  if using the S-Video port..then you'll need to enable it within windows. Right-click on the desktop and click Properties. In that window click the Settings tab and if there are two blue boxes click the one that mored greyed out. Below you'll see a white box with the words "Expand my Windows desktop to this monitor." Click that and hit the Apply button. If it all works after that click OK.<br>  If your TV has a DVI/HDMI input there is a program you can use to adjust the resolution and video timing to make it fit right. I know it works with most ATI and NVidia cards - probably others too.<br>  It is called PowerStrip3 ...<br>  i personally use the vga cord...i unscrew it from my monitor and hook it up to my big screen...but b4 doing that i have to change the resolution to a lower setting or else it'll be fine booting but then turn blank...but keep in mind vga has no audio so u will need a single male plug to rca jacks...i jimmy rigged one from old headphones...i took the plug from the headphones and stripped it the metal...and i took old rca's and stripped the ends..i soldered the rcas to the headphone jack..taped it up and it works like a charm...i know... way ghetto...but wasnt going out at 8pm to buy 1 so i made 1 in less than 10 mins...lol...gl..if u have any question just email me.

Find the file, click on it.  This opens the .zip file.  <br>  <br>  Then click 'extract'.  Depending on your computer it might ask where you want the extracted file saved and if you want a folder created.  I have the files saved to my desktop and say 'yes' I want a folder (because sometimes there are three or four or more files that will be unzipped and you don't want to have to look all over the place for them).  <br>  <br>  Once you've unzipped or extracted everything you can close the .zip file and look for the font files. <br>  <br>  Find the icon that has two blue 'T's on it (TrueType font) or an 'O' (I think in green).  Hover over that file icon until it is highlighted (don't click on it).  <br>  <br>  Then you should have on the side panel to the left an option to 'Move this file'.  Click on that.  <br>  <br>  A window pops up and in that click on C:.  <br>  <br>  From C: find WINDOWS  and click on it (I think it is at the very bottom of the C: list).  <br>  <br>  In WINDOWS look for 'Fonts' and click on that.  This will highlight 'Fonts'.  Then click 'move' at the bottom of the pop up window.  <br>  <br>  If the file moves properly you should have another pop-up with a bar displaying the downloading of the font file.  Once it reaches 100% it will close and your font should now be in your WINDOWS font folder.<br>  <br>   I usually just open a Word document to check and see if the font shows up.  You could go to your font file, but there are a bazillion little font icons and I can never find the one I'm looking for.

BhNP2P8Xaa	Blocking packet sniffing and scanning isn't as critical as making sure you don't leave certain ports open. In fact, you should scan your system pretty regularly yourself, and any servers you run at home, to make sure there is nothing hanging out there.<br>  <br>  Blocking all sniffing will likely require that you block all UDP packets, which isn't always a good thing, as it might interfere with things like DNS requests.

Even then, it's only really an issue if there is someone malicious in control of one of the systems between you and the server.  Although it is possible for someone outside of those parameters to sniff packets, they are likely a highly skilled person who doesn't really care about the information of joe shmoe and will more likely target a large corporation or even more likely some government department.|`|ovPfkHSCaa	You don't have to worried.

d3b8d95f3c206880dff89e3a0ed42336aa	You can't go wrong with a Canon. My personal experience says avoid Epson printers. They are problematic. I know people who have had three replacements in one years as they do not last long. They have only two quality settings. One best but the sheets take ages to print and draft that looks like its written in pencil.  They use ink like there's no tomorrow and the print heads are easily blocked even compared to others.  Epson may suit you if you only print the occasional sheet but if you print a lot then avoid.  I've had three and never again!|`|yMchHj9eaa	HP is the best|`|BMHG9Hswaa	The Canon i-series is quite old, look at the new Canon Pixma line of printers.<br>  <br>  Any printer out there today will print photos, some better than others.  HP does have some good ones and so does Canon.  If you are looking for wide format look at the HP Photosmart B8350 (I think) and the Canon Pixma Pro 9000.<br>  <br>  They will all hook up to a computer, it really depends on what operating system you have.|`|HOAqzrS6aa	HpPSC is thhe best|`|z46THMt8aa	As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson and have had no down time since.<br>  <br>  Epson has also made things easier for their customers by standardizing their cartridges. Most of their printers use one of two types. The three-color plus black use T069 (CX5000 CX6000 CX7000 CX7400 CX7450 CX8400 CX9400FAX CX9475Fax NX100 NX105 NX400 Workforce 30/40/500/600 and C120) and the 5-color plus black use T078 (R260 R280 R380 RX580 RX595 and RX680). This means you should be able to find a lot of people who use the same cartridges you do and possibly buy in quantity. When it's time to replace the printer, the next model will probably also use the same ones. <br>  <br>  Though I am quite happy with the results of the CX8400, if you really want the absolute best photo quality, go with one of the 5-color ones. Some of the models above include scanner and/or printing on DVDs.<br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.

But I can tell you from experience that while it's not rocket science, managing osCommerce is not exactly easy.<br>  <br>  Skinning osCommerce is even harder, so if you can't find a prebuilt theme you like for it, expect to either pay a hefty sum to a qualified designer to skin it for you, or to spend a hefty chunk of time yourself (at least a week) doing it.

2BL1eNYyaa	First of all, a firewall is one of the tools used to secure a computer network.A firewall can prevent unwanted access to departmental systems while preventing local systems from attacking systems on other networks (on the other side of the firewall). Firewalls require on-going monitoring in order to ensure that they do not unnecessarily restrict access to important computer resources while preventing unwanted access and to ensure that the firewall is operating as expected. Firewall logs should also be reviewed regularly in order to evaluate traffic patterns including denied connections. Installing and operating a firewall to protect a departmental LAN is only one of many criteria that Network Administrators need to consider when determining the security requirements of their environment. A complete security assessment will help identify other areas of vulnerability.<br>  Understood!!!

The Audio is PCI and the Video is PCIe, they are two different plugs, as long as it says 1 PCI and 1 PCIe they can both fit.<br>  <br>  2) Why buy an audio card anyway?

4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	Perhaps you are too young to know that Internet has not always been the way it is now.<br>  <br>  Prior to Al Gore's famous "I made the Internet," the Internet was strictly a government, scientific, military, and educational network.  Only select people had access to them and to put a website on it, it required a government sponsor.  It was billed as a method for educational and governmental institutions to share information, more or less, for government related and military related researches.  There were no private e-mails, shopping, personal sites, etc, etc, etc.  Commercial traffic were prohibited.  This is not surprising if you think where Internet came from.  ARPANET.  It was a small network linking Pentagon and few defense contracted universities.<br>  <br>  Also, most of web traffic were text based.  The "browser" as existed back in the period had no graphic capabilities.  Sound came much later.<br>  <br>  Basically, after 1992, it was opened for everybody.  Everyone with means to run a site is now permitted, and ANY traffic is now allowed.<br>  <br>  So, this "privatization", (perhaps more accurate term is commercialization) has everything to do with what we see today.|`|U9n960GYaa	Simply means the internet is not censured in any way.... although there have been laws passed as to limit pedophiles or other sex offenders on-line...<br>  <br>  Otherwise.... you can say or view what you want without government intervention...
9kfjIRLyaa	It stops people (sometimes) from sharring music and videos and stuff that shouldn't be shared. However, like I already hinted at, they can be circumvented.|`|XvMPdzjUaa	Is it necessary? Does it do any good? For us, as end users... not really, it's just an annoyance. <br>  <br>  However, it has helped make a lot of things possible that would have never happened otherwise. For example, without DRM, the record labels would never have agreed to making the iTunes music store happen. We wouldn't be able to watch TV shows we missed online the next day. Ultimately, without it, the record labels and tv networks wouldn't have agreed to make useful things like this happen, and as we're starting to see, once they've been convinced that it works, they have finally started remove DRM from the files we're buying.<br>  <br>  So has it done good? well yeah, in that it has convinced the labels and tv networks that the internet is not the big evil place they had painted it as|`|3c8f4e75997fa4e2743ad3bbb5cf864baa	Whether it was necessary or not, it has been terminated,for the most part, due to consumer opposition.<br>  <br>  I, personally, think that it takes away the consumers right to experience the audio fully. Viral marketing or "Word of Mouth" has always helped musicians/artists make a substantial profit. I don't think any music lover has complained about not getting their cut of the profits for the free service they have provided over the years by enlightening friends & family via reviews or conversation about the bands/artists they love.Now multiply that by any particular band's fanbase!! Imho,the only reason why the record companies want to restrict the user is due to the lack of quality in their current trends,er, I mean "products" and the fact that they have not spent the time to figure out a viable solution to deal with this new way of sharing information(internet). <br>  <br>  Ulitmately, the record companies have made their millions off of poor practices & reducing the quality of the music you are listening to by following trends and engaging in the "Loudness War"(Compression of Lossless formats). Now, because they are feeling the pain of their bad decisions, they want to limit the same people who made their easy living possible!

yMchHj9eaa	Use TVUPlayer or follow the steps below<br>  <br>  I googled it<br>  <br>  1<br>  Make sure your computer system meets the minimum requirements to run cable TV without interruption of the signal. You will need a DSL Internet connection, Windows XP or Vista and the latest version of Internet Explorer or Firefox.<br>  Step2<br>  Obtain and install a TV tuner card or similar adapter program. Without the appropriate software, you will have trouble watching shows in real time. However, you may still be able to watch prerecorded programs or those that are available to download from a server. You can get a TV tuner card online or at an electronics store.<br>  Step3<br>  Decide between an internal and an external TV tuner card. The internal tuner card is plugged directly into your motherboard, while the external card is accessed via USB. Both work equally well, but internal cards may be harder to install and are not the right choice for laptops. External cards tend to be more expensive.<br>  Step4<br>  Ask your cable provider if a particular subscription system or software program is needed before you can access the system's programming. Access can be completed through the use of special access codes given to you by the cable company or by installing software directly from a CD.<br>  Step5<br>  Download a good player to watch TV programs, rather than using the player provided by the website itself. Not only are downloadable players such as TVU Networks more effective, but they also provide a more even stream (see Resources below).
SJM0rzHtaa	Depends on what kind of video output is on your laptop.<br>  <br>  If your laptop has an HDMI port, just use a standard HDMI cable to connect to one of the Bravia's HDMI inputs.<br>  <br>  If your laptop has a DVI port, you use a DVI-to-HDMI cable to also connect to an HDMI port on the bravia.<br>  <br>  DVI/HDMI is the best way because it's a digital video signal, and it can go all the way up to 1920x1080 (your Bravia's 1080p High Definition native resolution).<br>  <br>  If your laptop has a VGA port, you can use a standard VGA monitor cable to connect to the VGA port on the Bravia.  Not as good as HDMI/DVI, but is the next best option.<br>  <br>  Don't use S-video.  S-video is low-definition and is garbage compared to HDMI/DVI or VGA.  And your Bravia has both HDMI and VGA ports.<br>  <br>  As far as sound goes, if your laptop has HDMI, it will carry both audio and video on that one HDMI cable.  Otherwise you will need a stereo-mini-to-dual-RCA cable to get sound.  You plug the stereo-mini end into the headphone jack on your laptop, and the red and white stereo RCA jacks into the Left and Right RCA audio inputs on the back of your Bravia.,<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|6b20b31ca0cc72763d8a38403afd5bcbaa	Some of the newer TVs have a VGA connector (computer monitor).That would be the best connection. If the bravia doesnt have one then go with a S-Video jack. It will be round about the size of a dime with 5(maybe between 5-7) holes for pins in it. Theyre about 5-10 dollars. You will need to hook up your audio seperatly irregardless of which video jack you use. You need a cable with a headphone jack on one end and 2 RCA jacks on the other. <br>  There is a cable that is VGA on one end that plugs into your laptop and it has 3 RCA jacks on the other for the TV. You may need to order one of those I havnt seen one in a store. It would be better than the S_Video cable|`|VtnwtXtFaa	Two things need to happen before a laptop can work with the TV.<br>  <br>  The screen resolution of your computer needs to be set to 800x600 instead of the default 1024x768<br>  <br>  1...Click on the "Start" button <br>  Go to "Settings", then open "Control Panel" <br>  Double-click on "Display" to open it <br>  Click on the "Settings" tab <br>  In the "Screen resolution" area, slide the bar to the left until the setting below the bar reads "800 by 600 pixels". <br>  Click "Ok" at the bottom of the window, and then "Ok" again when asked to confirm the resolution change. Finally click "Yes" to accept your new settings. <br>  <br>  2...Your laptop needs to send a signal to the TV. Press and hold the "Fn" key, then (on Dell laptops) press the "F8" key at the same time. On other laptops this may be F5 or other keys - refer to your users manual for this information. Each time you do this, the laptop switches to the next position in the cycle (1. only laptop screen 2. both laptop and TV screen 3. only TV screen) ...best for a lap top is to use a vga cord...and yes u need a audio cord....its a 3.5mm jack that turns into rca jacks....you can also use the s-cord..it has built in sound but the quality is crappy...gl...email me if u have probs

yMchHj9eaa	What kind of motherboard do you have? Even better, take out the RAM out of your RAM slot and buy the same exact one but bigger. I doubt your motherboard runs dual channel because you have 512 in there, and if there are only 2 slots, you can only upgrade to 2GB, if there are 4, then by 4x1gb stinks.|`|HtfqFgEgaa	You will want to purchase 184 pin DDR - ( 2 )X 1GB PC-3200|`|CWEO27okaa	For RAM there is different pin types DDR3, DDR2, DDR, and a really old one which the name escapes me.  Reading your specs I would guess your computer uses DDR2 but the best way to see what you need is to go to 4allmemory.com, or a RAM manufactures website and look it up by your computer model.  <br>  <br>  If you want to max out your hardware configuration you will need to buy two, 2GB sticks of RAM.  However, as your probably have the 32-bit version of windows xp due to software restrictions 3GB is all windows will use or "see."  My suggestion would be to get a 2GB and 1 GB stick of whatever type (DDR2, or DDR) ram you need. <br>  <br>  On a side note, although the RAM upgrade is needed what graphics card do you have ?  If you only have an integrated card and not a dedicated graphics card, adding one would really help in your endeavor to play games.<br>  <br>  GL|`|t9XVzeRMaa	What model is your computer? I.E.

ezcaRxLtaa	Hi Kitty,<br>  <br>  Yes I think you can from my recent experimentation with this effect and using Photofiltre. Also... I was experimenting with another effect called "Lomo" style as well. <br>  <br>  I was using Adjust>> Hue and Brightness/contrast controls and then selecting a specific "color channel" to adjust. Like turning up the red and green colors creates some interesting effects. It does take a bit of practice and is worth seeing how original cross process looks like from real 35mm film that has been cross processed to fully appreciate this effect.<br>  <br>  Also I had some success using the "RGB Fantasy" plugin which can be downloaded from the Photofiltre site.<br>  <br>  I've put this on my list of future Photofiltre blog tutorials to do.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Jeff (Photofiltre Tutorial Blogger <a href="http://jeffagogo.com)" rel="nofollow">http://jeffagogo.com)</a>

If you want the salary for at jobs that have the title: "Subordinate", just replace MANAGER with subordinate.<br>  <br>  Sidenote: The LIKE statement is normally used for queries where you need to use asterisk, like WHERE name LIKE "Peter%". The query then returns any name that starts with Peter, thus the % represents the asterisk. Underscore _ represents a single character that can have any value.

EUVr6uNVaa	I actually e-mailed Dell about this last month because I recently got a Dell Inspiron 1525. I wanted to try and hook it up to my phone with bluetooth. Like you, I presumed that there was Bluetooth because there is a little bluetooth logo next to my wi-fi indicator on my laptop. <br>  <br>  However I e-mailed them and they said that my laptop didn't have bluetooth compatibility. So I guess just because the bluetooth logo is there doesn't mean the laptop is capable of supporting it. They said once you switch the wi-fi switch on the bluetooth should come on also. If it doesn't then I'd imagine your laptop doesnt have bluetooth|`|odTEkyvyaa	First thing to try is to pres Fn + F2. That is the Dell default bluetooth switch. <br>  <br>  Second one is the switch you use for your wifi, turn that to the on position. <br>  <br>  if neither of those works then you need to restart and go into the bios and make sure that bluetooth is allowed.

zorYTX59aa	If YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest you<br>  either change, install or get stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  Please don’t tinker with your "Java Scripts", "Flash Players"<br>  or different browsers -- and definitely stay away from any of<br>  the software that salespeople (disguised as answerers here<br>  on Yahoo) are trying to sucker you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you because I am pretty sure <br>  your computer and YouTube was working fine before, right?<br>  The first rule of thumb and ideal option should always try to<br>  be: DON'T disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, <br>  add, change or install anything. Matters will only get worse.<br>  <br>  Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you are using Google Web Accelerator or a utility<br>  similar to that: Dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall <br>  it. Do all that you can to get as far away from it as possible,<br>  even though this seemingly contradicts all my advice which<br>  I wrote uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking "Don't <br>  Accelerate This Website" will not help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos properly, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com" <br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").<br>  <br>  Note 4: depending on how your YouTube account is set up,<br>  your personal "video playblack quality" (or "VPQ") could be<br>  set to "dynamically" or "fast", thus making YouTube videos<br>  play at higher quality. This in turn eats up lots of bandwidth,<br>  memory and "cache". If you are "logged on" to YouTube as <br>  you're reading this, you can verify your VPQ from right here <br>  within Yahoo!Answers by clicking my link below, which will <br>  bring you directly to "YOUR VERY OWN" playback setting:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/quality" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/account#playback/...</a><br>  Otherwise, if you must "sign in" first, click on the 4th black<br>  option which will be on the left side called "Playback Setup".<br>  <br>  Note 5: nothing about playing YouTube has changed in the<br>  past year. If anything, the newer Flash players are causing<br>  many YouTubers plenty of grief -- especially all 5 variations <br>  of version 10. It is absolutely crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54, and 10.12.36. Updates are only<br>  good for one thing: software/computer conflicts. Myself, I've <br>  never strayed away from 9.47, and many flashers swear by <br>  9.45. Think of those two Flashes as XP, compared to Vista.<br>  Check out the response to this "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that my information proves to be quite helpful for you.|`|YTIDE8Evaa	did you try updating your flash player ?

EmpOlMWraa	No, a quad core does NOT mean 2.83 x 4 = 11.32.  It means that that CPU has 4 separate cores (4 separate cpus kind of) each operating at 2.83GHz.  However, the rated speed of a CPU does not mean as much as it used to.  The Core 2 Quad is a newer technology then your current Pentium D and has a much better design.  In fact, Pentium is now more or less Intel's budget line.  Despite the lower clock speed of the Core 2 Quad, it WILL out-perform your Pentium on every front.  The Core 2 Quad is, by far better and more efficient.|`|IzwoSZGYaa	<a href="http://asia.cnet.com/digitalliving/ask/0,3800004928,62032410,00.htm" rel="nofollow">http://asia.cnet.com/digitalliving/ask/0...</a>

Trust me lappys easily overheat from just a little dust clogging the heat fins so make sure you clean the cpu heatsink/fan regularly .<br>  <br>   Also leave the lappy on normal mode that will make the fan spin more often than silent mode . And like the other guy said you can buy lappy fan pads you put under the laptop for extra cooling  at most computer stores.

DjGEJfaPaa	The IP address assigned to you by your ISP is dynamic (unless you have requested from your ISP a static IP address) meaning that it changes every so often on it's own. You can even help it change by powering off your modem for an extended period of time. You also mention you have wireless - this is your local network and it has it's own range of IP addresses that you can change at will - however this does nothing to what computers outside your network (the Internet) see.|`|AA12235978	If you have standard broadband from your cable company or phone company, you are issued an IP.

nkV5kLF5aa	There are two types of processors on your standard Windows Compatible PC, x86 and x64.  The difference between them is that the x86 processor runs in 32 bit mode, it's older but well used, many PC's out now are 32 bit.  Without going into details, it's how the internals of the CPU is made and how much memory it can access.  The x64 processor is 64 bit, typically they are faster, and can access more memory.  No matter which one you have, the 32 bit version of the operating system will work for you.  If you don't know what kind of processor you have, post it here and I'll tell you.  For now, get the 32 bit version as not all software (especially older software) will not work with 64 bit.|`|2afVnStxaa	There are 32 bit operating systems and 64 Bit operating systems in both XP and Vista, you will have to find out if your system is 32 or 64 bit to choose the operating system for it. If it is an older system it will be a 32 bit, if it is very new it may be 64 bit. Just go to your "my computer" and click system properties tab at the top. This will tell you about your system including current OS and if it is 32 or 64 bit. Good luck to you.

I could tell you that even if you deleted them yourself, there would be a costly solution which you may take your computer to the official tech support of your computer and ask them for retrieve the data from your hardware. The reason I'm saying this is that when you replace photos that way it happened to you, there is a big possibility that they are gone. This could be the last choice of yours. But before that, you may try something like looking into some files under 'Temporary files' name somewhere in 'Windows' folder. And try to find them there.

The school system will probably be unsecured or your computer is set up already for that system. The one at work needs to be set up.

This should show all wireless systems in the vicinity. Click on the one you want to connect to and click on connect. If it is a secure system you will need to put in the WEP or WPA code for that system.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. If not post more info.

However, if you want to put the picture on your page then use the HTML code on photobucket and put it in your about me, who i'd like to meet, etc. If u want to put a picture as your default but don want it to be a picture that people are able to comment, you need to make a new album on myspace, edit the options of the picture so nobody can view it but you, then save it there.

vAAGriFkaa	I personally like μtorrent - a great & simple torrents client.<br>  To increase the download speed, first you have to make sure that your download limit (which depends on your connection) isn't too close to your upload capacity.<br>  Also, make sure only one download client is running (don't run emule at the same time, for example) and don't download other files at the same time.<br>  If you are using a router to connect, make sure the recommended client's ports are opened. That part is a bit tricky and might need some technical knowledge. There are plenty of sites that can help you with that.<br>  Last thing, and perhaps the most important, the torrent's ration (seeders:leechers) should be as high as possible. The more seeders - the more people you can download from. The more leechers - the less available your file(s) will be.|`|VtnwtXtFaa	i use utorrent...ahahaha every1 here put a diff answer|`|qB7BtvTEaa	www.isohunt.com|`|05ce4DRNaa	hi<br>  personally i refer you Bit comet (FREE WARE) because here your download get scored and you will get a rank so you are also see what others are downloading most and what is going on new in the market and around your world.<br>  in getting the high speed on the torrent see peers and lots of you can get it with little experience.|`|hC8QiAwiaa	if u want to find all site torrent by one click use Bit Che software.<br>  its free and easy to use.<br>  how to increase the speed by changing its preferences?<br>  u cant increase ur downloading by changing preferences the thing depend is u r server if u r home is far away from u r sever then more cooper lose. the thing u can do is set uploading value low.<br>  256kb plan for 10kb<br>  512kb plan for 15kb<br>  1mb    plan for 30kb<br>  and 2 mb plan for 40kb.|`|UT3iOmA8aa	Webdesign Tips And Tricks<br>  <a href="http://freshbloger.com/" rel="nofollow">http://freshbloger.com/</a>

8m6fJ6cXaa	Your AMD 900mhz computer is going to have issues with XP.  Also you can only upgrade it to 512 MB system ram and if you install the SP3 patch it will more than likely take that up.  I would suggest that you actually look at investing in a new computer that has XP installed and keep you old one for a backup.  The next thing a 40 GB hard disk is kinds small these days.  Sorry for the bad news.|`|TMAq2m7Gaa	I would just buy the ram, it's dirt cheap now. The Min requirements are not the way to go with an OS. I would put  at least double that in the computer for application overhead.|`|AA10459818	ok don't mind the other idiots lol....<br>  <br>  Me stinks, you need to get rid of it, it is Microsoft's worse ever OS even worse then vista and 98.  Stability will drastically increase if you run XP.  Performance should slightly improve as well.<br>  <br>  Your computer has whats called an integrated video card.  This means the video card on your main board uses some ram from your  main ram bank.  In your case it looks like it is using 6mb.  128 would run xp or any other os quite poorly.  I recommend you you run at least 256 or 512.  You will see a HUGE improvement when you upgrade the ram.  Once you upgrade to xp as well you will have a lean mean computer.  Buy the ram and if you can't install yourself find some experienced friend to install it for you.  Geek squade and suck will charge you a ton for a 5 minute job.  You can prob buy the ram for less then 30 bucks.  <br>  <br>  <br>  in answer to your last post, Xp will make it slightly faster, but the main advantage is stability.  It wont freeze or crash nearly as often.  ME is also very prone to viruses which can make your comp slower.  Xp is def a good idea to upgrade once u get the ram.<br>  <br>  the 15 gig hd shouldn't cause an problems....btw you should run defrag one every 3 weeks on any os.|`|lT8yExI1aa	128MB is the minimum RAM required for windows xp to even function.

ZZAPms1Raa	I am a pretty avid mac fan, so i would suggest the Apple mini.  Based on the specs that will come with the Apple mini, it would be more than enough to suit your needs.  Based on other people that I know that have used the mini, they have absolutely loved it.  It is small enough that it does not take up much space, yet it does what you need it to do.  Plus, if you ever have any problems, apple is superior on customer service, especially the genius bar at any one of their stores.  In terms of the tv things, i think that deal looked a little sketch, I wouldnt use it.|`|nkV5kLF5aa	While I have never personally used one, the Mac Mini looks like it would be a good choice for you.  Be sure to get a wireless router so you don't have to buy extra hardware for the Wii or have cables running everywhere.  The Mac Mini is simple to use, but I'm not sure if it is compatible with your Zune.  If possible, try to spend about $100 more to get the 320GB model so you will have more storage space and memory.  The Satellite software you linked to is not what it seems... It just links you to free internet video feeds, and you still need a computer to use it.

If it's actually XHTML and CSS compliant, it's some of the best work I've ever seen posted here.<br>  <br>  That you posted it as a picture on Facebook leads me to think it may be all Photoshop.

If that doesn't work, then take a credit card or something soft to scrape at it. If none of that works, then you need to use a single-sided razor blade.

Every time I have gotten a blue screen (about 4 times), it has been because my hard drive was damaged. You may want to get your hard drive looked at, and if it is damaged, you can have whatever data was on their salvaged. Most of the time, you will get the majority of your data back.<br>  <br>  So, my guess is that you have a damaged hard drive.<br>  <br>  Advice: don't go to any of the big stores to get your hard drive's data removed, i.e. Best Buy and Geek Squad.

The best you can do is have hardware firewall.  That is a computer that sits between you and the internet intercepting the hackers.|`|I0waERKqaa	ABSOLUTELY.<br>  <br>  <br>  With trojans and viruses getting stronger, and smarter, they are all about bypassing firewall.<br>  <br>  They can and they do!!!<br>  <br>  I just got a trojan, DON"T waste your money.<br>  <br>  Get AVG, it's free and it's the best program out there. All the computer nerds swear by it.|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	'Impenetrable' and 'cyberspace' don't go well together. <br>  <br>  It really is a matter of making the rout to send information through a fire wall so tedious that it's simply not worth it. When you get to the point where it would be easier to just fly out and rob the person than to get their bank details through the firewall, then the fire wall has done it's job. The problem is that all firewalls need to permeate some information. otherwise you would just unplug it from the internet, and put it in a steel cage. <br>  <br>  The firewall is never going to be totally secure, but remember your front door isn't either. Nothing is going to be 100% especially a commercial product, but they succeed in discouraging a potential virus/hacker.|`|HVlc9ezKaa	The idea behind internet security is that the protection given to the asset creates security such that the amount of time it takes to retrieve the information wanted would take an unreasonable amount of time.<br>  <br>  That's why encryption is not hacker proof. It's just set up so it would take an EXTREMELY long amount of time to crack without the key (upwards of thousands or millions of years). BUT, then again the cracker could just get lucky and figure it out in 10 minutes depending on the password.<br>  <br>  The same goes for firewalls.<br>  <br>  Also you might want to look at a cost/benefit analysis to determine if what the benefit you are going to receive is worth the cost of the asset.|`|V8FdzAAAaa	Any firewall can be breached, usually it's quite easy.

If they are for private research or your own amusement you would probably be OK. In your case however you should seek the owner's permission to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  Anyone who puts stuff out there has very little control over who copies what - or who is able to access it. If the right click - save picture as.. function is disabled then it will mean the image is almost certainly subject to copyright.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Other than the fact that it's a violation of copyright (whether the use is commercial or not), it's not a big deal.  Obtain permission first.  If they don't give you permission, don't use the image.|`|xSdnsSojaa	Saving images for private personal use is usually OK, but if you use them for any other purpose, such as putting them on another web site, without the copyright holder's permission, you could be in serious trouble. The first step will likely be a cease and desist request from the owner's attorneys. If you ignore that, you could be sued.<br>  <br>  By all means, contact the webmaster and ask for permission to use the images. Explain why you need those particular images rather than something similar that might be in the public domain. He may grant permission for limited use provided proper credit is given. If not, don't push the issue.|`|AA11434745	Generally speaking, images produced by the government are in the public domain and therefore free from restriction for use.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, images that appear on Wikipedia are licensed for use on personal Web sites.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, if you ask for permission to reproduce an image and are granted that permission, you are free to use the image.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, if an image housed on someone else's Web site can be viewed by the public, you can "hotlink" to that image on your Web site; that is, you don't upload the image to your site, you simply link to it on their site.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fairuse.stanford.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://fairuse.stanford.edu/</a>|`|kxlmcG4gaa	Right click, click on Save picture as, insert picture into document.<br>  Or just copy and paste,<br>  Its what i do =P|`|d35e33382064124c01a8080f7ea11b45aa	Save it and have fun.
iyTAW52qaa	If you or anyone has created anything, it is copyrighted inherently.  So no, you can't just take images.  But by asking permission, you're withdrawn from most liability.<br>  <br>  The disclaimer simply releases liability of the owner for whatever activity you engage in on the website.<br>  <br>  The privacy policy is a statement of how a website handles, stores, and distributes user's information.|`|gCevqNXfaa	If the site does not say that the content is copyrighted then that doesnt mean it isnt copyrighted. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do if you are not sure is to contact the person whos website it is.

It could be used as a copyright or for something else like "We are not liable for blah blah blah"<br>  <br>  And a privacy policy is a legal document that is dealing with the information related to customers' and merchants' private profiles. It really doesnt have much to do with copyright.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Anything published is copyrighted.  Putting things on a website is publishing, so all website content is copyrighted.<br>  <br>  Copyright means you are the only one who has the right to make copies.<br>  <br>  A disclaimer usually means "even though the law says I'm responsible, I don't want to be, and I'm hoping that you don't know that I am."<br>  <br>  A privacy policy is the policy the company follows as far as disclosing customer information to others.|`|53sVKcOeaa	You can copy any picture and put it on your site (unless it specifically requests you not to), a picture can be flagged by the owner if they don't approve. If the picture has a copyright on it, there will be a copyright logo on it or the authors name. However if there isn't any then copy the picture regardless, even if they do complain there's no proof they made it. Copyright is the protection of material, disclaimer is to avoid liability and a privacy policy is a terms and conditions (can's and can not's of the site).

Here’s my advice from it:<br>  <br>  1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.<br>  <br>  2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as you’ll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.<br>  <br>     * McAfee Stinger – a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.<br>     * SpyBot Search & Destroy – a spyware/adware scanner<br>     * Lavasoft Adaware – for spyware/adware<br>  <br>  Note – it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once you’ve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.<br>  <br>  3.) If the above fails or you’re not sure if you’re still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select “Safe Mode” and repeat the scans once you’re connected.<br>  <br>  I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|cbe5ac9d4d131e7e6adc392a47fdb091aa	Antivirus programs will NOT remove these parasites which are created by rogue / fake software.

Pull them out, and push them back in. Check the metal contacts for damage. It might also be a bad ink cartridge. Just because something is brand new, it can still be bad.<br>  <br>  Have you tried the printer diagnostics that should be in the printer properties? It may need attention before it can be used, like an alignment or cleaning procedure.

FZmu6Pm9aa	If you don't remember your username (logon) or password there's nothing you can do, you need to get the school to reset it for you. There might be a means of getting the password if you know your username. If you are entering the username and password that they gave you it's possible someone has hijacked your account and changed one or both items so I wouldn't delay in getting it resolved in that case.

If your paying then probably forget it.<br>  <br>  The performance will depend on whats already fitted, if you've only got the standard 256 then adding the 1Gb will almost certainly improve things, if you have 512 and are taking out a 256 to fit the 1GB, then 60-40 it will be faster.

I still run one in my back up storage computer, but its like 6 years old at least.  I mean they were good computers int heir day, and still are for basic stuff...not gaming.  I would never put any money into a computer that old.  Just cuz you upgrade the card, your bottle neck is probably the CPU.  128 isn't bad for video, and i wouldn't put money into a part that might not really make a huge difference. What games are you trying to play?  If I know that I think we could see if the video card will really be worth it.  Depending on your mobo, you may be able to upgrade your cpu to a dual core.  I think this would be a much better advantage.  Do you know what Fsb/socket your mobo has?|`|bByVjwkvaa	It all depends what you will be playing or using the card for.

INPUT DEVICES - Used to feed data into the computer ?Keyboard – most common ?Mouse – selects, moves or draws items on screen<br>     9. PROCESSOR - Computer system unit that receives and carries out the series of instructions known as a PROGRAM ? All systems regardless of size have a central processing unit or CPU ? Processing circuits are in one piece known as an integrated circuit “chip”. ? Other “chips” support the work of the processor chip in a variety of ways.<br>    10. MAIN MEMORY  - Data/instructions processed by a computer do not remain on the processor “chip”. ? Data/instructions are stored in memory chips. ? Groups of memory chips make up main memory or main storage. ? Data being processed spends most of its time in memory.<br>    11. MAIN MEMORY CONT’D - Data/instructionsare stored as electronic impulses in specific locations in memory. ?Memory is like a post office with mail boxes ?These mailboxes have a number known as its NUMERIC ADDRESS. ?A memory chip may be either RAM or ROM memory.<br>    12. MAIN MEMORY CONT’D - RAM (Random Access Memory) is used as temporary storage while processing is done ? This memory is “volatile” --- its contents are lost when the computer is turned off. ? Amount of RAM is measured in units called “bytes” ? One byte is amount of memory to store one character – “mega” means “million” – 256Mg represents 256 million characters ? ROM (Read only memory) holds data permanently ? “nonvolatile” – its contents are not lost when the computer is turned off. ? Stores instructions to start computer and since it is “Read-Only” new information cannot be added to this type of memory<br>    13. AUXILIARY STORAGE Auxiliary storage devices hold data outside the memory of the computer as long as ? the user needs. These devices are “on-line” to the computer, meaning they are directly connected to ? the computer and under the control of the CPU. The most commonly used auxiliary storage device is the disk drive. ? The disk drive stores information by copying it onto a diskette. ? A diskette is made of flexible, magnetic plastic and frequently referred to as a “floppy”. ? The diskette is 3.5” and holds 1.44Mg of data. Recently CD’s have become a storage device for new computers that have CD ? “burners” which records or “burns” data onto round, 4.5” disks that hold 600Mg or more of data.<br>    14. OUTPUT DEVICES - A computer MUST have at least one output device ? It records, prints, or displays information into useable form. ? The most frequently used output devices are the Video Display or Monitor and the Printer. ? The monitor has a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) similar to that of a TV screen.<br>    15. OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE - Hardware is the physical equipment parts of the computer. ? There are steps to follow to process data entered into a computer. These steps are known as a Program. ? Programs in general are known as Software. ? There are 3 basic categories of software: ? Operating System Software ? Utility Software ? Application Software<br>    16. OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE - Consists of programs necessary to keep the hardware functioning. ?It sets up and maintains communication between the processor, auxiliary storage, input devices, and output devices. ?It controls copying of data and feeds data to the processor ?Most commonly known as DOS (disk operating system)<br>    17. UTILITY SOFTWARE - A Utility program is a program that performs routine jobs. ?Usually part of the system’s software, but can be bought separately with additional capabilities. ?Firewallsoftware and Virus Protection software ?Norton’s Disk Doctor ?Scandisk and Defragmenter (part of the system that is used frequently to

The more that you have the more programs your can run at one time without effecting system performance.  The more memory you have will not make your computer faster that is what the processor does.  The storage is long term this is where your files and applications are stored for retrieval.  Short Term Memory is erased when the computer is turned off and Long Term Memory is not erased when the power is off.|`|XXLOMOjeaa	The memory holds only the information that you are using right at that time. The more memory the computer has means the more things you could in theory have running at the same time without the computer slow down (there are other factors affecting the speed of course)<br>  <br>  The Hard Drive is like the warehouse for the computer. It stores all the information on the computer. Windows, documents, pictures, music, etc. Then when you open it, the computer copies it from the hard drive to the memory. Then copies the changed files back again when you are done with it. The bigger the hard drive the more stuff you can store on it. Also the more stuff you will lose if your hard drive crashed and you don't have a backup.

If the volume is currently in use, a message box will appear prompting you to indicate whether or not you want to reschedule the disk checking for the next time you restart your system. Then, the next time you restart your system, disk checking will run. Your volume will not be available to perform other tasks while this process is running. <br>  If your volume is formatted as NTFS, Windows automatically logs all file transactions, replaces bad clusters, and stores copies of key information for all files on the NTFS volume.|`|32cb8156ad7b656220324d46a1f150c3aa	Currently having the same error. This started when Service Pack 3 was installed. It seems that it had a glitch and so went through hell to get it restored. Event the MS Support tech hinted that maybe the computer croaked after we could not get it out of the F2 Screen.<br>  <br>  Point: recovered, rebooted from scratch. Problem, when doing so, you have better have the original CD that came with the PC. Otherwise, you are out approximately $299. The current XP update CD is no longer recognized by the computer, it runs and I have full access to computer and it runs like new, yet I cannot view Word, Excel, Powerpoint or Spread. Can no longer view DVD, or playback cds for this drivers have since been replaced and CD no longer available. <br>  <br>  Fact: It seems the system hajacked itself, you may want to check what service pack you are running on computer. If SP3, - good luck. I am still trying to get DELL or MS Support for assistance.<br>  <br>  Consider a repair instead, click on f8 and try that.

It's Hot in There<br>  Sometimes this can be caused by an overheating situation. Itunes, RealPlayer, Windows Media player,etc. require a lot of processing power to decompress and decode music files, which can cause the processor or hard drive to get hot.<br>  Memory Fails Me...<br>  If you determine that overheating is not the problem, the most likely suspect is bad memory.<br>  II. Don't Do Me Any Favors<br>  There's a setting buried in Windows XP that tells your computer to restart when a system error occurs. you turn off that option, you may solve your automatic reboot problem. <br>  1) Click Start, then open Control Panel<br>  2) Click Performance and Maintenance<br>  3) Click System <br>  4) Click on the Advanced Tab<br>  5) Click Settings in the Startup and Recovery section<br>  6) Uncheck Automatically Restart in the System failure section <br>  Note that this may prevent the system from restarting, but it can also mask the true problem.<br>  The most common cause of computer restarting is a corrupt registry. <br>  Most likely your registry is bloated and overstuffed with an assortment of useless pieces of data. The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>  III.

I believe it also allows you to run CMD and other processes, meaning you can scan the infected drive using a linux-based anti-virus etc<br>  <br>  To get knoppix, goto their website, download the ISO file, unzip the files using Winrar onto a harddrive and burn them onto a cd.<br>  <br>  NEW INFO<br>  <br>  When you run the win xp cd which you are getting from a 'friend', let the blue screen load up until it gives you 3 options. Installing it, exit and recovery console. Run the recovery console and when prompted for code (like cmd on xp) type in chkdsk /r . You could attempt to run the registry program but i doubt it would work. The code is regedit, give it a try.

Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800 <br>  subscribers and 20 videos or maybe 500 subs and 30 vids -- as well as a total <br>  view count close to the 1,000,000 mark.<br>  <br>  Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,<br>  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:<br>  -- a 875x150px "banner" for your channel ?<br>  -- a mini-banner beside each played video <br>  -- your channel-page video on "autoplay"<br>  -- extra channel boxes: bulletins, profile<br>  -- automatic higher quality to your videos<br>  -- unique videos over 11:00 minutes long<br>  -- more options for your video thumbnails<br>  -- being at the very top of search results<br>  -- unique skins/sizes for the video player<br>  -- the possibility of earning "ad revenue"<br>  -- the light-bulb "watch at night" feature (if you are considered a "broadcaster")<br>  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section<br>  and featuring only your uploaded videos.<br>  <br>  If you wish to know more, go to the top righthand corner of any YouTube page, <br>  click "Help" and then type in the searchbox the word "partner".

Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space.

If "best" to you means reliable host and the lowest price, I suggest you do the following:<br>  <br>     1. Go to the webhost review sites such as webhostingjury, hostingsthatsuck.com or webhostinggeeks and list down about 3 common top hosting companies.<br>  <br>     2. Next, for each web hosting X, do a “X sucks” search on Google. Read some complaints and see if you may encounter the same problems like them. Some of the complaints may relate to certain groups of users only such as VPS, dedicated server users or resellers. So you may not be affected if you are not from these categories.<br>  <br>     3.

(Right click on the AV icon on the lower right side of your screen and select open control panel or similar)<br>  There should be a link to press to view the files and if you click it you will be shown the files.<br>  Google the files in question and look for what others have found.<br>  <br>  This is my best answer to a fairly vaque question and would suggest you post a bit more info like what Anti virus/spyware program you are running and what operating system you are using (Windows XP, Vista, OSX, etc) I will watch for updates.

Because some have a Norton removale tool. If your pc does not have this, you have to first uninstall Norton, then do a search in the registry for Norton, then Symantic, and NAV, to delete all strings and folders that that have anything to do with Norton anti virus. You can search Google for complete instruction on how to do this. Then uninstall every other anti virus program you have installed and all the spy ware and adware searching programs. Then reboot your computer. Then search Google first for Spybot Search & Destroy use the site safer networking solutions. Choose UAS , and then pick a download mirror to download from, any of theirs is good and I have used others too. When you install it make sure you also download the TeaTimer. You do not need to download other languages or other skins. But DO do the automatic updates selection. After it is installed, run it. It will take a while to do the scan but let it go. It will find everything that is not good on your pc showing all just before it is completed scanning. Do not be surprised to see thousands of items that need to be fixed. After scan check FIX ALL ITEMS. It may not remove all of them yet but you can in the next step. After it fixes what it can in the first step, reboot your pc and go into SAFE MODE by continually clicking the F8 and or the F10 key as soon as the system starts to boot. A screen will come up, select safe mode. The run spybot again and do another scan and fix all items found, then reboot. Then download NOD32. These two programs are the best programs ever and have been around for years and have a daily update feature, Spybot is totally free and NOD32 is free for 30 days but I know people that I installed it on their pcs that its been free for years as is mine. If you need more help email me telling me you need more help and I answered your question here. pastorwilliambarhorst@yahoo.com These programs use the smallest memory than any other programs out there and are the smallest most powerful ones out there. If you need more help I will give you my cell phone number so I can walk you through it all.

Most of the time it's really 4,000,000,000 bytes.  But a GB is actually more than 1 billion bytes.  The difference comes in how computers deal with numbers and how computer scientists and engineers have labeled things.  1 kilobyte (KB) is actually 1,024 bytes or 2^10 (kilo is based on the Greek word for 'thousand').  A megabyte (MB) is 2^20 or 1,048,576 bytes (mega is Greek for million).  A gigabyte would then be 2^30 or 1,073,741,824 rather than 1,000,000,000.  So if your flash drive has 4,000,000,000 bytes it's actually 3.72GB instead of a full 4GB.<br>  <br>  All the confusion stems from people who use the terminology incorrectly.  The same thing is true of hard drive sizes.  A 320GB hard drive actually has a capacity around 298GB (320 billion bytes).  A bigger number sounds better, and it isn't exactly dishonest.  It's not exactly honest either, though.  Keep that in mind when your shopping for data storage devices.<br>  <br>  If you need more space, you'll need a bigger thumb drive.|`|DFQZ8U0raa	Thats the case with every single HDD, Flash Drive, MP3 and so on, you will never get a full 4GB its always a few MB less than it says. So dont bother getting a refund thats just the way it is.|`|x1YZgCCnaa	4gbs is 4096 mbs, this isn't what Microsoft or manufacturers said, this is what it is because of the way a computer operates. As someone else said you will never get 100% of the space you pay for.|`|XlyLakYAaa	That's standard.  4GBs means 4,000,000,000 bytes.  But computers are binary, so 4GBs is really 4,294,967,296 bytes.  Do the math and you get 3.7252902984619140625 GBs
FBQZ06vraa	Do this:<br>  <br>  1. Click the Home tab on the Ribbon.<br>  2. In the Paragraph group, there are two buttons in the center of the upper row.  These will tab a bullet left or right, depending on the arrow in the button.<br>  <br>  Note that the bullet style will also change.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.
AA11976863	Unless you have a backup somewhere, such as on a TimeMachine drive, you can't do a one-click fix. You need to boot to the install disc, go past the language selection, and click "Options" to choose "Archive and install preserving Users and network". Later, you can go through the "Previous Systems" folder to see if there is anything you need to keep. Otherwise, trash it.
