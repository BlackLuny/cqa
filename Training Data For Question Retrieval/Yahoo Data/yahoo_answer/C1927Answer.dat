MgiFzQsqaa	Hey, Well first it depends what phone you want. If it is the i phone 3g the phone price wont go down any time soon. If it is an Lg phone all of them were just on sale, now there not. If you are looking for a newer phone chances are a couple of months. If you are looking for an older phone it could go on sale pretty soon.|`|M3CsxF2jaa	they wait about a good 6months
e0T07Mgnaa	okay i have the BB8320 and i love it it has a battery meter up to 5 bars and 7 days i tried the 8110 and i hated it it had the same thing but it's battery lasted for 4 days. the only diffrence is the Blackberry curve sunset has a camera but it does not have video playback witch means it does not take videos so i advice you if you are gonna get the blackberry 8320 get the titanim 8320 not the sunset good luck.

0SFGnjq2aa	i have a nokia n95 and on o2, Do you have problems with packet data or web connection timeouts. I would assume your on contract with being on post pay. I am on PAYG and use the web browsing bolt on at 7.50 per month, and its cheaper in the long run than you using post pay as you pay for every MB downloaded.     I have similar error messages like yours and the only way to try and stop them is by trying this and see if it helps reload the page.    When you get an error message click on options, then onto navigation options, then click on reload,  now that sometimes reloads the page you was on,    doesnt always work, but give it a try     I use o2 internet quite often so if you have any further probs let me know,  i might have had them in the past so may be able to help you    good luck

CKRfaRYvaa	Incoming calls will show up on the call log and phone bill as 'unavailable' or 'restricted.'  Outgoing calls will show up on the phone bill just like normal and should show up in the call log like normal, just with *67 in front.  However, it is extremely easy to delete certain calls from the call log, so that my be why you don't see the numbers.  They can't be deleted from the bill, though.

sBRh1Ptvaa	Hello, It depends on who the phone is through if it is a pre-pay than you wont be able to download from apple itunes, there is a reason that those phones are locked and that is to keep you from being able to go around the proper service agreements to use the phone. However I buy a lot of iphones from china witch are really knock offs and there is a way to download from apple itunes but you will have to go to google and look up apple itunes converter the info is pretty simple and it works hope this helps.
4Pk6VNftaa	This is apparently the most common problem the PS3 has.  Mine developed it too but was fortunately still under warranty (in fact, I convinced Costco to take it back for a refund.)    Anyways, looking on the internet, the main culprit seems to be - once again - dust building up inside the drive.  Gee, Sony, didn't you learn anything from the PS2?  Guess not.      There are plenty of (free) websites and videos showing how to open your PS3, the blu-ray drive, and then gently clean it with a q-tip.  Since your warranty has expired, it'll cost you money to get it fixed, so this may be a good alternative.  Success rates for this procedure look to be better than 60% (assuming you're careful)    If that doesn't work, some places are now selling replacement blu-ray drives for the PS3. which is cheaper than buying an all new PS3.  Still, unless your old PS3 was one of the ones that still had backwards compatibility, you may want to just buy a new one anyways - and this time pay for the extended warranty from Best Buy...just in case.    Stupid Sony.|`|Li45o7ovaa	it sounds like the laser is bad... so sony is your best bet (they will sometimes replace or fix a console for free even if the warranty is expired) or you could buy a PS3 blu-ray assembly for about 45 dollars and try to fix it your self (or have an experienced technician do it)|`|1c0f793db881cd47badc0d00bd5bd1caaa	This is a major problem with PS3s, your best bet is to phone Sony in the UK 08705 998877 and tell them the blu-ray is broken don't worry about the warrenty, they will tell you to reformat the system in case it is a firmware problem, tell them ok,  you can try if you want but it won't work, if you agree to do that ask the customer relations person for a reference number so you don't have to explain the problem every time you phone, also tell them you didn't spend 300+ on a system which is going to break down in under 2 years, warranty or not. Tell them it is breaking your heart or your children's heart if you are over 20.  Above all be courteous and they will replace it, it is what I did.  Best of luck because I do know how you feel.|`|feiZ4uCyaa	Sony are nice. They usually replace systems out of warranty! Just try! :-)|`|sbNnnPewaa	same happened to me few months back :(  luckily i was in warrenty and got it replaced free of charge.  the bluray laser will either be dirty or damaged..  Cheap option- buy a bluray cleaning disk......normal cd/dvd ones wont work as the lasers are at diffrent hieght so dont try those.    next cheap otion-....bu y the part and replace yourself....i wouldnt advise this but guides can be found via google    3rd option and 1 i would do-  phone sony and explain to them what is happening and say its been doiing it ever since the last firmware update....this way they might replace it for free.....fingers crossed  if u do send back to sony remember your b/f to back up his game saves or he will have to start them over|`|i6SY6XsMaa	You can actually buy a lens and replace it yourself.

duxyEB1vaa	the iphone has many pros and cons as i have researched myself for the very same reason --   but since you say that you use your camera just wanted to let you know that the iphone does not have a video ability and also does not have a flash on the camera. i also know that they iphone only allows you to send pictures in a message (MMS) by email so if the reciever doesnt have the internet on their phone they will not get the msg. and yes, it is required that you have the $30 internet plan when you have the iphone by at&t. as far as i can tell the touch screen response is pretty good, but sometimes texting is a little tricky.
m8UCgMdAaa	Nope, I did this. Just remember to take out your SIM card and put it in to your new phone that you'll be using. I went online to take the data package off of my contract, it takes a month for changes to come in to effect. But for AT&T, I didn't need to resign a contract or anything, you can change your plan as often as you'd like.|`|kCik6ayraa	there will be a penalty for getting out of the plan. first get out of the plan then sell the iphone and take out the sim card or whoever you sell it to will have all ur information
NBkpOgIgaa	I have the Iphone. Its pretty good. Its got the automatic spell corrector on it, not to mention all the apps you can download on it, it's a pretty sweet phone.   I didn't like texting with the storm. I just didn't like how you had to actually "click" the screen. kinda defeats the purpose of a touch screen in my eyes.   and I've never messed around with the palm pre.   but it all depends on what cell provider you have too, since the iphone is from at&t and the storm is from verizon.

You can get video from any number of sources - mostly by using programs like tubesucker to download video content posted on youtube (you will need a converter like "quick media converter" or eRightsoft Super to convert from flv (flash video) to mp4, the format of iPods.  You can also download using torrents or peer-share (don't even bother w/Limewire - it's useless enough for getting audio files; it's worthless for video) like winmx or eMule.    as for putting it on iPod - just search this forum - the question of how to transfer media comes up every day.|`|vcBQ7np7aa	yes, you can download youtube stuff  go to this site:  http://www.zamzar.com/url/|`|ywmqenCGaa	There is a list of free download resource:  http://www.dvd-video-converters.com/free...

Prefira cameras  de boa qualidade que sirva tanto para fotografar os passeios, reuni?es sociais, paisagens e tambm... Fotosub! e com caixas estanques prprias.    Voc tem que ter em mente que uma camera digital para fotosub n?o precisa necessariamente ser de ltima tecnologia e lan?amento com pre?os elevados, o que precisa ter  recursos.     - Procure cameras de marcas conhecidas no mercado: Marcas Canon,melhores, (Canon PowerShot A640 vs A620 Sem Estabilizador macro 1cm,Canon PowerShot A710 IS Macro1cm,Canon PowerShot SD800IS ou Digital IXUS 850 IS macro 3cm e Canon PowerShot SD850 IS ou Digital IXUS 950 IS Macro 2cm ) e Sony DSC(W70,W80 e W90) s?o boas para fotosub e fotos de ambiente em geral.     - Evite os modelos SLIM (corpo fino), pois poder?o ter problemas para adequar comandos de caixas estanques nela.   - Veja qual a mdia utilizada: Cart?es tipo SD, XD e MemoryStick s?o mais modernos que os Compact Flashs.   - Fuja das cameras tipo DSLR-Like. Em geral s?o muito caras, possuem uma lente objetiva zoom ampla com visor eletr?nico, mas de nada acrescentar para fotosub.   - Procure saber se ela tem possibilidade de ajuste manual. Pode parecer at absurdo para o vendedor que certamente ir pergunt-lo para que queira algo assim indagando que quanto mais automtica melhor, mas para fotosub n?o . Camera sem ajustes manuais ir limitar muito suas possibilidades de boas fotos.   - Abra o manual e nas especifica??es da camera veja se tem ajustes de ISO ao menos de 50 a 400, velocidade de 1/30s a 1/1000s, abertura de f/4.0 a f/11, ajustes de balan?o de branco para luz do dia-flash, incandescente, fluorescente e nublado com controle manual para tudo isso.   - Pressione o bot?o de disparo da camera e veja se demora muito para fazer a captura. Tempos longos significam muito shutter-lag o que  ruim.   - Atualmente procure cameras com no mnimo 5 megapixels.   -Distancia mini (macro) at 3cm .Determina a distancia mnima do foco em mod macrofotografia (para fotos de perto)    CAIXA ESTANQUE:     H uma preocupa??o muito grande para a caixa estanque poder suportar o flash interno da camera, mas este n?o deve ser o motivo no momento da escolha, porque o flash interno causa muito backscatter sujando a imagem obtida. O ideal  ter em mente em adquirir futuramente um flash externo.     - A caixa estanque deve suportar no mnimo 40m de profundidade ou 5 atm de press?o.   - Cuidado ao comprar as caixas estanques principalmente dos fabricantes das cameras, pois para eles 4 atm significam 40m de profundidade e n?o 30m!   - Procure ver se existem orings de reserva e que sejam fcies de encontrar no mercado.   - Certifique-se que a caixa estanque possua os comandos principais para ajustar a camera.   - Verifique se a caixa estanque tem uma fura??o inferior para adaptar a base e o bra?o para o flash externo.   - Normalmente uma boa caixa estanque conta com um suporte de manuten??o. Veja se a manuten??o  possvel e se existe pe?as de reposi??o caso necessrio.

Prote??o ao Meio Ambiente:A fotografia submarina, por si s, j contribui para a preserva??o do ecossistema marinho. Ao verem nossas fotos, de seres marinhos que habitam as guas de nossas praias e ilhas, as pessoas pensar?o duas vezes antes de jogar lixo nas ruas (que chegam ao mar pela a??o das chuvas) ou nas praias.   Se alm disso, pudermos associar o risco potencial de nossos poluentes a vida dos seres marinhos, estaremos contribuindo para uma educa??o ecolgica. Um bom exemplo disso s?o as mortes de golfinhos, filhotes de baleias e tartarugas, asfixiadas aps ingerirem sacos plsticos ou embalagens PET, pois confundem este lixo com guas-vivas e lulas, que fazem parte de sua dieta.   Como estamos iniciando uma atividade ecologicamente correta, precisamos pratic-la com responsabilidade, dando exemplo de prote??o ao meio ambiente.   Muita aten??o nas 8 regras a seguir, e lembre-se: voc s deve iniciar-se na fotografia quando j estiver dominando estas tcnicas naturalmente, sem precisar ficar pensando para execut-las.      1. Controle de Flutuabilidade: voc precisar estar prximo aos seres marinhos para fotograf-los, mas sem perturbar o ambiente do recife.  essencial o perfeito domnio de sua flutuabilidade; devemos ser capazes de subir ou descer apenas pelo controle respiratrio.  2. Posi??o das Nadadeiras: quando prximo do solo marinho, devemos flexionar os joelhos, fazendo que as nadadeiras fiquem mais altas que o corpo.  3. Locomo??o: use as nadadeiras em movimentos laterais, semelhante a pernada de nata??o no estilo peito. Isso evita o fluxo de gua em dire??o ao solo, que levanta sedimentos.  4. Apoio: para estabilizar no fundo,  prefervel buscar um ponto de apoio para os dedos, sobre uma pedra ou na areia. Bater muitas vezes as nadadeiras acabaria levantando suspens?o, que  nociva aos corais. Se precisar muito, apoiar-se completamente no fundo, busque a areia e use os joelhos, nunca as nadadeiras.  5. Evite mover pedras ou outros objetos do fundo. As esponjas e outros animais que crescem nestes abrigos s?o muito sensveis a qualquer movimento de gua ou exposi??o a luz.  6. Nunca toque em peixes, corais e outros seres vivos. Voc pode remover o lodode prote??o e contamin-los com bactrias estranhas ao seu meio.  7. Nunca alimente os peixes.

AA11054885	They have these all over the place - in big box stores like wal-mart or shopko, and home improvement stores like home depot and lowes.  They start out around $80.    the reason they're not used here as much is because our houses, on average, are larger than the houses in Europe, Israel and China which makes central AC much more practical and affordable.  The units you're referring to are energy suckers to the extreme!  And, like someone else said, it's annoying having to turn it on when you get in the room just to have it barely cool the room before you're leaving it again anyway.  In a very small studio or apartment/house, it would be sufficient.  But that's usually not the case.|`|56aPsgD0aa	yes! go to isreal, china or europe, they have them there.

a3af81286dfd9fe585b51e5152aa3b55aa	You asked a very good question. Vibrator consists of two major components, one is the D.C. motor and second is the vibrating mechanism. As you might be aware that D.C. motor is a simple device, by giving a D.C. supply from mobiles battery it will start rotating. This motor is attached/coupled to the vibrating mechanism. In this mechanism there is a off centre device which activates the vibrating strips and/or weight(depending on the design by manufacturer). The frequency of the vibration depends on the speed of motor. This kind mechanism is also used in lot of toies on a bigger scale. Here in cell phone it is used in a very micro form. Different manufacturers have different type of vibration units. This device consumes the more power than ringing tone device.  I hope this makes clear the vibration mode of cell phone, do not hesitate to ask some more details of the sub components is required. Have a nice vibrations.....!!!!|`|AA11932313	A spinning wheel  that has a weight on one side I think.|`|8b07983c500affafd7aad23e1ab49e16aa	Well When Some One Calls You and The Ringer Is Set To Vibrate, IT Just Simply Vibrates, You Can Feel It!!!|`|603e0c424b9d8285254192561e12b25caa	you know how a game controller vibrates, it has a motor in it that spins an unblanaced weight causing it to vibrate|`|AA11708967	thanks for asking this question- ive wondered the same thing!|`|1365e6db3c96feee6f79471375929d8baa	The phone receives notification of an incoming call which triggers either the ring option or the vibrate option or both. The vibrate feature of the phone is through a small motor that has an off balance weight attached to the motor. With it being off balance it causes a vibration. This is used in MANY other objects not just phones. You can't get much more technical about this due to the fact of circuit diagrams for different models would be much different.    Motorola E815, V710 are located in the same place near the hinge in the top flip of the device. These are contact connectors and don't have wires.    Samsung A670, A310 and LG VX4500 are located attached to the back housing and have small electrical wires attached to the processing board.    Various different models have them placed in different places inside the phone.

You want to make sure you buy a Sprint Phone, because Sprint phones use certain frequencies, while for Example Cingular uses others, so if you get a Cingular phone it won't work with the Sprint Network and you have a piece of junk.|`|AA10726931	yes..i just bought my replacement (recomended by both Sprint and Samsung that I go to eBay) on eBay.

Most other phones that are "unlocked", can only be used with GSM service providers, which are T-Mobile, and Cingular. GSM service providers use a sim card, where as Sprint does not. Hope this helps.|`|18fc966213e7193c76170c05ce3214abaa	It'll have to be a Sprint phone, or compatable with Sprint's networks.    Most unlocked phones are GSM-- and those will not work with Sprint.

ec8dbe4a38c9035ca00d3c5811c97a50aa	Yes, the pink Chocolate is out although not all providers have it. I was planning on getting it, but it was expensive. The Cherry Chocolate is probably what they call the "Wine" LG Chocolate here in the Netherlands.|`|0a626459b83f90b906870aa255d39c4caa	Verizon Wireless has what they are calling the "Cherry" Chocolate: http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store...    Not quite pink though. Currently Verizon is the only US carrier who has this phone. Telus (in Canada) has it, but in black only. Same with Rogers Wireless (again, Canada), they have a GSM version of the phone.    Verizon no doubt has an exclusive on thephone for a while in the US, but the fact that a GSM carrier in Canada already has it, I wouldn't be surprised to see it on Cingular or T-Mobile soon.

j5Apt8hWaa	A colleague of mine has one.    He uses it when he has to use shutter speed higher than the sync speeds found on other cameras.  (1/160th to 1/250th second).  With the D70's electronic shutter the flash sync is 1/500th second which is fast enough for shooting outdoors with flash, just like the first Canon 1D (4 MP sensor)    Its excellent 6 mp sensor produces high quality, professional level images.  Many pros who use Nikon DSLR's have one of these model Nikon's in their camera system for situations when a slower flash sync speed will not work.    I have been looking for a good used D70 for quite some time, but it seems that most owners hold on to them as a second or backup camera.|`|lB7PX2Voaa	I have a Roland D70 but it isn't even a camera so I don't know what I'm doing here. lol     I like Nikons but I prefer Canons.|`|7U3RQBLtaa	Sorry i dont have that camera|`|AA11540967	It's been an outstanding camera however I had to have it fixed.

Over all a great camera.|`|9e00e91a75ce8fd7739bf446a1e98f67aa	Yes I have Nikon D70   What I like about it is the fact it's not a Canon.   I don't like auto shooting modes on any camera.

psk4aPvuaa	Liquid-crystal display televisions (LCD TV) are television sets that use LCD technology to produce images. Benefits of LCD technology include lower weight and reduced power requirements when compared to other display types. Often, LCD television screens can also be used as computer monitors.    A plasma display panel (PDP) is a type of flat panel display now commonly used for large TV displays (typically above 37-inch or 940 mm). Many tiny cells located between two panels of glass hold an inert mixture of noble gases. The gas in the cells is electrically turned into a plasma which then excites phosphors to emit light. Plasma displays are commonly confused with LCDs, another lightweight flatscreen display but with very different technology.|`|AIQ6taIUaa	The way the picture is rendered.  Plasma is known for its trailing effects when it comes to fast moving objects rendered on a screen.  Even a high grade tv will have the streak  trail effect.  LCD is not prone to the same streak problem.    Also, there's a running joke which has given plasma a bad reputation.  After 5 years of regular use, you need to replace your plasma tv.  It's based on the old versions of plasma monitors.  After 5 years of regular use, the monitor starts breaking down, and the trailing effect becomes more noticeable.  It's still a problem with the plasma based monitors but not nearly on the same level as it was back in 2000.    Of course, I'd never buy a plasma based tv, even if it does boast 1080 dpi.  Once it starts trailing, the 1080 rating is reduced.  Once that happens, I might as well go watch stuff on my old 54 inch and get over the screen door effect.|`|0b3e82779cc89a6025224a7529811edcaa	its simple LCD uses a liquid which contains crystal which change colour when electric charge is applied to it....    plasma tv uses charged gas which changes colour when electric charge is applied...|`|5NuDlM6Saa	LCD TV can be big or small, but plasma tv is only big

OITIngejaa	You don't need a VoIP compatible phone to use VoIP. You can use a regular telephone that plugs into a VoIP router. Most VoIP companies either charge very little for the router, or offer it free when you sign up for a plan.    One of the disadvantages of having a regular telephone plugged into a VoIP router is that it will be the only phone you can use. The fix for this is to get an expandable VoIP phone base. This is a VoIP phone with the router built in, and makes it possible for you to have multiple handsets throughout your home just like with a landline phone. This is why a VoIP compatible phone can be a bit costly.    There is a way to beat the high price of a VoIP compatible phone though. I highly recommend Packet8 since I use them for both my business phone, and residential. You have a choice to pay monthly, or yearly, and if you get an unlimited calling plan you can get a free VoIP compatible phone expandable up to 10 handsets, or an even nicer one for $19!     The biggest advantage of VoIP phone over a traditional landline is cost. Hands down. For example with Packet8's Freedom Unlimited plan you can get unlimited local and long distance calling in the US,Canada, Puerto Rico, Guam, US Virgin Islands, France, Italy, Ireland, Spain and United Kingdom, plus unlimited in-network calling to other Packet8 subscribers worldwide for $24.99 a month    There are other VoIP phone services providers with even cheaper calling plans, but in my opinion Packet8 is the best value overall.|`|AA10838998	I have no home phone as I now use a computer link over broadband..download skype and buy a set of headphones...I can phone any land-line in the world for virtually nothing and contact computer to computer for actually nothing..BT were screwing me for years with their line rental charges...I will never use any land-line phone again..|`|7815dc83d0ff43d9f7a9a7b9b4f0fdc1aa	Most reputable VOIP services offer devices that you plug into your computer to get a phone port. That being said, all phones should be VOIP compatible.    VOIP is generally (but not always) cheaper. Some services, such as Skype, simply have VOIP without phones (using your computer's mic). Haven't tried it, but it's a tempting price.|`|053d9a317e424ef548c11f9dbc7959a0aa	The main advantage is price, the main disadvantage is that phone service requires that your electricity is on.|`|HKMUlF6kaa	VoIP is Voice over Internet Protocol so the advantage is the price and the disadvantage is the quality. Quality is okay most of the time but there will be times that the quality will be bad. Still the money you save is worth to get a voip service.    Before you sign up with any voip provider make sure you know your calling habits. If you are not a heavy user then its totally useless to sign up with unlimited plans that will cost you half the cost if you sign up for a low plan. So search and compare plans.    I personally use Onesuite voip for its pay as you go scheme suits my calling habits. As with most voip providers, Onesuite voip will work on ATA and VoIP phones. |`|sEqy9aO3aa	Hi,  I can recommend a voip video phone it costs 79.99 and has many extras including a digital photo frame,it runs through your router and the package cost is round about  10 per month on a contract and this gives you all your calls local,national and international,with no limit on the duration of your calls,it is fantastic and runs in conjunction with any broadband provider that you may have.|`|e0n6WnGnaa	I would check out teleoptions.com     Give them a call. They are a premier seller of VOIP telephony at awesome pricing with warranty. I got my VoIP phone through them and I had them integrate my system into my cell phone so I have the same features as my office phone on my cell phone. Great people and  great service. I would definitely recomment them. You don't need to spend the extra money. Just tell them what you want to achieve and they create your solution.    Hope this helps|`|4W7vXi8naa	I think the above user meant http://www.teleoptions.net    I am familiar with them as well since they did my companies whole phone integration system.

They are located in South Florida but they fly out all of their techs to help you out. They are an Avaya Business Partner and can really create a great telephone system for business needs. Its really cool because I never pay long distance calling through my IP phone. I get to also transfer the same options on my IP phone to my cell phone so I can continue to make sales even when Im travelling.

They have $10 $25 $50 and $100 dollar prepaid cards and if you spend $100 on prepaid minutes then you're considered a "Gold Rewards Member" or something like that and that means your minutes last a year    As far as texts go, it's free if someone sends you a text, but it costs 10 cents every time you send a text    But yeah, I REALLY love it because I can go months with one $25 card.  |`|LeHob4qLaa	Go to Tracfone.com. I had several phones from them, you truly pay as you go, it's 10c's a min. Their phones are Nokia's or Motorolas. Nothing Fancy, but they get the Job done. You can "recharge => Minutes) Online, or buy Minutes almost anywhere. Target, Walmart even Gas Stations, have I seen Phone Cards from Tracphone.     But Online is where you get the best "specials".    I hope I was able to help you!

AA11503051	Hi Torchy    There's a simple solution here, but because you haven't given us the model number of the Sony home cinema system it's a bit more complicated.    It's sounds like you've done almost everything right, but you got just one thing wrong: -    Basically you need to tell you're sky box to output the Audio via the Optical out - this is done via the audio settings on your sky box. It's set by default to HDMI hence you're not getting any sound from your Sony system.    There's an easy way to check with optical outputs. Unplug the optical lead from the Sony amp (Leave it connected to the Sky box) You should be able to see red light coming out of the end of the lead (Honest!) If you don't have red light the sky box isn't sending the Audio via the optical lead.    Once you've set the sky box to output the Audio via the optical lead, connect it to your sony amp.    This is where it gets tricky as I don't know what Sony home theatre system you have.    But you need to 'tell' the Sony amp to accept a Digital Optical input, it might accept it automatically but you might have to go through the sytem settings. Basically you will have the choice of accepting the Digital audio from one of 3 cables: -    The HDMI cable  A Co-Axial Digital Cable  An optical Digital Cable    Once you've done that - hey presto glorious 5,1 sound from your Sky box.    Please bear in mind that not all Sky output is in Dolby Digital, it goes without saying that you need to make sure the broadcast from Sky is a Dolby Digital one - Pick a modern film from one of the Movie Channels.    Good luck, it will give you something to do this morning while we're all snowed in!    Boris    Edit 9th February    Hi Torchy,     It sounds like you've done everything right! - Jonny gave good advice regarding the sound delay issue so I'm not sure what else you can do.    I'd give the guys at the Sony technical helpline a call : -    Sony customer information centre on 08705 111 999    Good luck,    Boris|`|848c3c596d821d8f27c64a25f1db134eaa	You need something like the box ive added in the link and also a optical switch ive added in the other link  http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_...  http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_...

qGfAlDd2aa	Yeah, Telemundo works hard to put out a good signal.  (I work for Telemundo in Texas).    Anyway, you obviously need a better antenna than what you are using.  Without knowing where you are, I can't say for sure which would work the best in your situation.  It all comes down to how strong the signals are in your area.    Visit http://www.antennaweb.org .   Based on your zip code, the site will suggest antennas (with a standardized color code) and will tell you where you need to point it.

No 3G network, though.    But to cut to the chase: flash player is for 2003 and above, game capability is limited; skype is available for 2002 but that's as close as you're going to get for phone service.    You'll probably want to get something running windows mobile 5 or above to get iphone-esque functionality. Even then, it won't be close.

GIMP or Paint.com are great programs to start out with. They don't have all the features, but they are completely free.    When it comes to tricks and tutorials, google can be your best asset.

However, it is slower than Photoshop and has a horrid user interface.    There are many cool tricks. Best to take a course in photo editing or read lots of tutorials.

As this accumulates, it can slow down the XBox or exacerbate heat issues.

3TqPF1zMaa	People have made amazing photographs for over 100 years without fancy technologies like IS and VR. (Or autofocus or auto exposure or automatic film advance or super zoom lenses or colour ...)You can too.    Good camera technique is the most important method for steady pictures. Learning to hold the camera correctly and to use trees, walls or even a friend's shoulder to steady a camera in difficult situations will earn you better photos than relying on technology.    However, the advantages of IS and VR to an experienced photographer are definate and not just "hype". Like any technology, (autofocus, auto exposure, colour film, digital image sensors ...) you need to understand what it does and use it to your advantage. You can't just press a "make great photos" button on your camera and instantly have a DVD full of pro-quality, award-winning photographs pop out.    Disclosure: I am the owner of http://www.lenslenders.com in Canada.|`|6584a2c112e4342d61a5a55cbb9aafd0aa	There are 2 scenarios I can think of where the ability to reduce vibration is useful. One is using long telephoto lenses. The image is difficult to keep still when trying to shoot hand-held, so most people use a fast shutter speed (rule of thumb is 1/focal length), but if conditions don't allow and a slower speed is necessary, the VR/IS is a big help. The other scenario would be if you're doing something like, say shooting from a moving vehicle. Someone once told me about a shooting idea he had that would require him to shoot lying down in the bed of a truck to capture the image properly. VR/IS in this situation, even at shorter focal lengths, helps make the shot happen.|`|HBNx77BBaa	VR isn't just hype.

If the battery is nickel metal hydride (NiMh will be printed on the battery) then you want to make sure it is charged for 24 hours before using it.    However, most cellphone batteries these days are lithium ion (li-ion on the battery) and do not suffer from the charging memory effects that plague NiMh batteries. If you have a lithium Ion battery, you can use it without fear of the charging effect.

AA10098924	John Larson, a University of California medical student, invented the modern lie detector (polygraph) in 1921.

The name polygraph comes from the fact that the machine records several different body responses simultaneously as the individual is questioned.   The theory is that when a person lies, the lying causes a certain amount of stress that produces changes in several involuntary physiological reactions. A series of different sensors are attached to the body, and as the polygraph measures changes in breathing, blood pressure, pulse and perspiration, pens record the data on graph paper. During a lie detector test, the operator asks a series of control questions that set the pattern of how an individual responds when giving true and false answers. Then the actual questions are asked, mixed in with filler questions. The examination lasts about 2 hours, after which the expert interprets the data.     An earlier and less successful lie detector or polygraph machine was invented by James Mackenzie in 1902.|`|963298c0ac721d2a3f0535b53b526bf4aa	in 1921 by john larson

Well the solution is extremely simple. You can get another Ps2 from ebay or locally for about $50-$60. Or you can buy one from Eb Games or Gamestop usually for about $10.00 less than the price they charge for new. (Roughly around $119.00) Or you can get it serviced by the local geek that will charge you almost the new price for Labor and will only change and unplug stuff until it works not knowing if he fixed it or not. Usually resulting in your games exploding into fine CD dust, and him blaming it on your kids by saying he found soda inside. I hoipe this answeres your question. (Sounds like its just not worth the time.)|`|809224dcd9fc569fcfea52fc3bbe4cf0aa	Is it making a scratchy sound?  I whack mine on the top a couple times and it usually works.

Check it out|`|0ce3e9be921c84abc619b32451930d7baa	We have 2 Ipods (reg and nano) at home and I hate using them, too much hassles to add songs with the software and the battery life is just horrible.  Plus I'm afraid I'm going to break them, they look so cheap with the touch sensor and thin battery.  I prefer using my Samsung YP-MT6Z 1Gig, I bought it for about $150 ordered online when it came out last year, wasn't release in the US I guess, couldn't find it anywhere in retail, only thing Best Buy, cicuit city had was the Ipod like Samsungs.  This thing is  about the size of an AA battery and that's all it uses too.  I get about 40-50 hours of continuous playtime on one Energizer.  Don't think any Ipod runs that long.  I can add songs by just pluging it into a USB slot and drag and drop the files into the player or copy and paste, no need for Itune or WMP or Real etc etc.  Also has FM/AM radio and a voice recorder which I use to record memos or lectures from the prof to listen later if I missed any notes.  And I like to use it as a small flash drive for my papers if I need to print them or something.  Also I can record any audio from an external audio device like a radio or cd player with its Line out plug, my player with automatically convert it into mp3 format.  It also has all those EQ settings and WoW, True Bass, etc etc..pretty much all those audio enhacement you find in WMP and more.  And it seems more durable and well built.  Part of it is made of metal, I've droped it tons of time and it never broked, don't think you can do that with an Ipod since theres so many sensitive components.  All in all well worth the $150 I spent. I would definetely recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to jump onto the Ipod bandwagon and doesn't care about movies or photos etc and just want music.  To me any portable devices (cellies, mp3, dvds) design in S.Korea is a sure thing...they're way ahead of us in consumer portable/mobil technology, have you seen what they can do with their cell phones and other portable devices? O.O   ...makes me want to move there...well anyways sorry I typed so much...LOL|`|31ad67cbeace3651759702fb63196d56aa	i have a dell dj and can put about 7 hours worth of music very pleased with it ....|`|AA10612527	i currently own a 1 gb iPod Nano and a Sony PSP...they are both awesome i would reccomend the ipod nano if you like listening to music.

Hope this helps you.|`|AA11420217	Apple iPod 30GB, I love it, it's everything that Apple said it would be. Yes I recommend ppl to buy it all the time, I was sorta like the consumer reporter in my brothers case, I got one (i'm the most technologically advanced person in my family, no offense to them) and when I saw it's ease of use and large versatility, I just had to get one for my brother who had recently lost about 12 CDs to sand getting in them from his boy scout trip to Galveston Texas.

2UBDkMrVaa	Hello Rhys, your problem could be related to whatever Operating system you are using. If you are using Vista, the basic version does have certain video Codecs that you need to view DVDs. Without knowing the details of your system my best advice is to download a video codec pack and install that on your computer and you should not have an issue. Here is a link to the Windows support page that explains Codecs: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows... . I think you want to look for a Codec, called DivX (http://www.wmplugins.com/ItemDetail.aspx... ). Sorting the codecs out might be your best bet.

You need to   1) download a program like Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to do the actual recording    2) Get a cable to connect your tape player to the sound input of your PC soundcard.    That's about it. you'll adjust the recording quality with your tape player or Audacity.    You can add the MP3 dll and it can make mp3s for you directly. Or you can make wav files for burning to a CD with another burner program.    Enjoy your memories,|`|ttT7W77gaa	just use standared red and white jack leads,plug one end of them into the back of your cassette player and the other ends into the back of your pc  download audacity free here for the software for your task http://audacity.sourceforge.net/   good luck.  ps.let me know how you get on

7yt2Ud0Faa	The main differences between premium and elite are the hard drive size and color.  The premium comes with a 60gb hard drive, and the elite comes with a 120gb hard drive (so the elite's hard drive is twice as big).  The premium is the default white color, and the elite is black.

18K7ucsEaa	It depends what kind of CD player you have. Some can play CD-RW and some can't.. if it's really old, it probably won't play a home-made CD. Also the music needs to be in a format supported by the CD player. Some CD players can play MP3 music off of the CD, but for most, the music will need to be in .WMA format. To check, go to the actual music file on your computer, right click and go to properties and check the format. If the music is in MP3, you can easily find an online MP3 to WMA converter... Windows Media player might even be able to convert if you need to~    :-D

If you are just going with inexpensive, you need to look at both rate plans and phones.  Rate plans: T-Mobile is pretty much the best.  It also depends on what featuers you would like.  Go to a site that compares rate plans from all carriers: cellufinder.com. The site also has links to the most inexpensive phones for each carrier.

"The Danger Hiptop is a GPRS EGPRS mobile phone with wireless Internet capabilities and some functionality similar to a PDA.    The Hiptop (Sidekick) was originally designed by the company Danger, Inc., which is located in Palo Alto, California and is manufactured by Sharp Electronics in Japan. Danger provides the Hiptop OS software and back-end services for the device. These include a catalog of downloadable software applications, email hosting, instant messaging and web proxies."    The fact that it is a GPRS/EDGE device makes it not work on the Sprint PCS network, which is CDMA. These networks use different receiver radios and are not compatable with each other.

I live in the Northwest and we have Comcast cable here. Adding HD to our digital cable package only increased the price by about $5 per month and added 13 HD channels, including HD versions of our local channels, TNT, Discovery, ESPN, ESPN2, and INHD.

In addition, you will need to have the local stations in your area broadcasting HDTV channels.    When the FCC gave out HDTV channels, they were given to the local networks (i.e. ABC, NBC, CBS) for free, under the proviso that they were to convert their signals to HDTV.  They could then sell their old channels.  The idea was that by 2004 (or 2005 or 2006), you could no longer get non-HDTV broadcasts and your old sets were obsolete.  Of course, the broadcasters have been continually requesting extensions from the FCC that they are not "ready" to give up their old channels.
AA10505082	i would get the Sony W30..they have for 199 on sale at like futureshop. great camera for the price|`|994923632d99710d006fbc6447787199aa	Hi!    If the recepient of the present isn't photography-savvy, you may want to look at the Canon IXUS range. They are small, pocket-sized cameras which has a large LCD, are generally light and look fashionable. They appeal to consumers who does not need to exercise too much control over a shot (i.e just want to 'point-and-shoot'). A great example which doesn't break the bank is the Canon IXUS 60 (also known as the SD 600).     Here are the full specs:  http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Ca...  Note that you can also read user opinions of this camera.     This particular camera is 6 megapixels, 3x optical zoom, great image quality and does movie mode with sound at 640x480. It is regarded as one of the best pocket-sized cameras around (even amist newer IXUS cameras like the SD900 and 800IS).     If she prefers to have a decent amount of control over her exposures, perhaps try a Canon A series camera. The A710IS (7 megapixels, 6x optical zoom, image stabiliser) and A640 (10 megapixels, 4x optical zoom) are great examples which boast full manual control. However these cameras cost a little more.     Here is a side-by-side comparison on the A630 vs. A640 vs. A710IS.     http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/compare_...    A cheap camera with great image quality AND full manual is the Canon A540. It is only approx. $150USD.     http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/Ca...    Generally, camera-makers which specialise in affordable point-and-shoot digital cameras include Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Kodak, Sony and Fuji.     Be sure to go down to the store to test it out in person.     Another important thing is to get a memory card with the camera. Generally, any camera you buy will come with a memory card, but a very small one - typically 16MB/32MB. You will want to factor in a little extra money to get something bigger like 512MB/1GB/2GB. Especially bigger if she intends on recording movies on her new camera.    Good luck with your purchase!

So if the songs are all 3 minute long they will be 4.5 MB each.     So a 512 MB player will hold about 110 songs and a 1GB player will hold 220.

AA11680713	As far as call recording is concerned that is basically provided by a third party add-on software for Symbian OS, and not a feature of the handset as such, out of the box. Almost all Series 60 handsets can run complete call management applications (which can take care of automatic answering machine, call diverting,  rejecting a call and sending sms to caller, recording calls).    So you can choose from many Nokia Series 60 handsets. Only thing you would like to take care of is that the handset has a good amount of RAM in it (internal phone memory, not the expansion memory card).    The important factor in choosing the handset is thus, not call recording but memory and as you asked, durability. But if you are going to spend nearly 25,000 you might want to consider what else do you want from the handset, a good camera? FM radio and music features? Form factor? Screen Size? etc.    Just jump to gsmarena.com for comprehensive guides to help you. offhand, N72 http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_n72-1552.p... or N73 http://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_n73-1550.p... might be a good buy and should come under 25,000. Use it in conjunction with Advanced Call Manager / Live PVR / Total Recall etc. to record calls.    Be aware though, most of the call recording apps (except maybe Live PVR or Total Recall when used with an OS 9.1 handset like N73 or N93) make a low beep sound while call recording is in progress, something to do with legal requirements.|`|AA10426866	Nokia
0b41984f22128d691287182e6e7821f8aa	Dr Martin Cooper, a former general manager for the systems division at Motorola, is considered the inventor of the first portable handset and the first person to make a call on a portable cell phone in April 1973. The first call he made was to his rival, Joel Engel, Bell Labs head of research.     AT&T's research arm, Bell Laboratories, introduced the idea of cellular communications in 1947. But Motorola and Bell Labs in the sixties and early seventies were in a race to incorporate the technology into portable devices.     Cooper, now 70, wanted people to be able to carry their phones with them anywhere.    While he was a project manager at Motorola in 1973, Cooper set up a base station in New York with the first working prototype of a cellular telephone, the Motorola Dyna-Tac. After some initial testing in Washington for the F.C.C., Mr. Cooper and Motorola took the phone technology to New York to show the public.   In 1973, when the company installed the base station to handle the first public demonstration of a phone call over the cellular network, Motorola was trying to persuade the Federal Communications Commission to allocate frequency space to private companies for use in the emerging technology of cellular communications. After some initial testing in Washington for the F.C.C., Mr. Cooper and Motorola took the phone technology to New York to show the public.    On April 3, 1973, standing on a street near the Manhattan Hilton, Mr. Cooper decided to attempt a private call before going to a press conference upstairs in the hotel. He picked up the 2-pound Motorola handset called the Dyna-Tac and pushed the "off hook" button.     The phone came alive, connecting Mr. Cooper with the base station on the roof of the Burlington Consolidated Tower (now the Alliance Capital Building) and into the land-line system. To the bewilderment of some passers-by, he dialed the number and held the phone to his ear.    Who is he?  Cooper grew up in Chicago and earned a degree in electrical engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology. After four years in the navy serving on destroyers and a submarine, he worked for a year at a telecommunications company.     Hired by Motorola in 1954, Mr. Cooper worked on developing portable products, including the first portable handheld police radios, made for the Chicago police department in 1967. He then led Motorola's cellular research.      Name: Motorola Dyna-Tac  Size: 9 x 5 x 1.75 inches  Weight: 2.5 pounds  Display: None  Number of Circuit Boards: 30  Talk time: 35 minutes  Recharge Time: 10 hours  Features: Talk, listen, dial     Source(s):  http://www.cellular.co.za/cellphone_inve...|`|a06dd6b37af3d6fd4aaf9cb2e3c245ddaa	It is invented by Richard H. Frenkiel and Joel S. Engel. The big breakthrough came when AT&T Labs researchers Frenkiel and Engel divided wireless communications into a series of cells, then automatically switched callers as they moved so that each cell could be reused.    :)

e5c4dd1e8663b69dbfed97ddc1608748aa	Unfortunately Verizon may not help you. . I have the 8300 and found out through expierence that LG (and most other major manufacturers) have a water damage detection strip (a piece of colored tape that changes color when submerged in water for a few seconds or longer) in the inner casing of the phone.  If you are unfortunate to not have the insurance plan, your options are limited to paying for repair or paying full price to replace.  The third option is that you have a nicer Verizon rep and they fell sympathy toward you and try to help you out a little more than my guy did.  I luckly had insurance and only had to pay the deductable ($50) to replace.  Since water damage is not warranty, don't expect them to bend over backwards to "give" you a new phone.|`|1bdbd8159e381fc8dfecad4903f0de28aa	Sounds like you'll have to check with Verizon to see what your return/repair options are.

That's the model I have and I love it.|`|da4eeefebd8c2990a9a22af907449c58aa	Ugh. It's very possible that even that brief immersion wrecked the screen (cell phones fry very easily if immersed).

I dont know if this feature is new but it has a screen lock and the only way someone can get in it is by hooking it up to YOUR computer..I thought that was helpful so people can steal it and run your battery down..the nano would be usless to them|`|572ccb858bbe28c28659f00051a7187eaa	The new iPod nanos are made of mostly aluminum. The older ones are made of mostly silicon and chrome plating. The new iPod nano would theoretically scratch less, but it hasn't been proven. None of the iPod nanos come with a charger. You have to buy one for about 20-30 dollars, or use the computer to charge it. The iPod nano comes with a USB connector to plug into the computer. The new iPod nano has a brighter screen, and 24 hours of battery life( the older ones have a lot less battery life).

That said, the chances are pretty slim being that they'd be kind of pointless. Also, opera (upon which wii online is based) is a very secure browser).    I'm guessing that getting rid of the virus would require reformatting, which isn't really a problem since all wiis are the same and, as I understand it, saved datat is on the SD card.|`|f5ff7febf68befb8744d50a0a283fdb8aa	I doubt it, they would first have to be MADE for the Wii.. Which I doubt some one will take that long to make one, and Opera is a VERY secure browser.. Sometimes I think it's too secure hehe...    Well viruses now can't affect the Wii since they aren't made for the Wii, it's like running a PC program on a MAC... They have different engines and all..    If you ever get them tho, Wii might make a remover, or you might have to erase your hard drive while backing up some in a USB drive or something..    Don't worry about it, keep playing...

Mom brought it to this repair shop who are experts on fixing wet units. The thing is its rare for a phone to be dropped in sea water unless you were thrown into it . Most wet units were a result of being dumped in a swimming pool . Youre lucky if your phone fell in the latter.    Fixing the short circuit and replacement of battery cost like $18.00 . The problem was the salt corroded 3 parts (mainly keyboard circuits and ****) and these parts are not easily available. And I dont know if its worth fixing all that but heck, a brand new Nokia 7250 i is 12,000 pesos or $215.00. *sigh*    If only I knew the first aid treatment of wet cellphones    So if this ever happens to you, REMOVE THE BATTERY at once and.      Source:Howard Forums    In the event that a non-waterproof cellphone/PDA/digcam accidentally gets immersed in water, you should follow these steps:    (1) IMMEDIATELY REMOVE THE BATTERY. VERY VERY IMPORTANT! 60 seconds later and it may be too late. The battery is usually the source of damage, not just the water alone. Water+Battery = Short Circuits! So REMOVE the battery! And DONT TEST the cellphone after its been dropped in water!  (2) As soon as possible (preferably within 20-30 minutes). dissassemble the phone using Torx T6 screwdriver. (Get this off eBay or service depots, etc) Make an emergency trip to Sears/RadioShack/ACE/service depot/etc.  (3) Clean/dry as much as you can, using Q-Tips  (4) Dry the electronics components under a desk lamp on a paper towel for 24 hours. A drop of water may have gone under chips and components where you cannot dry, so you need to dry under a 40/60w desk lamp, or 24 hours under a desk fan pointed down at the disassembled components.  (5) Reassemble the phone  (6) Put back together  (7) Only now its safe to put the battery back in.  (8) Phone may be good as new.    Try not use a hairdryer, unless with heat turned off or at very low settings. You do not want to scorch the electronics. A hairdryer may help in some cases, but more often than not (especially with clean water), a hairdryer will usually cause more damage caused by the stresses of expansion-contraction caused by all the heat. Its best to keep things cold, to keep any contaminants in the water as chemically inactive as possible.    If you follow these instructions, you have a reasonably good chance of a working phone after a non-waterproof phone was thrown into water.    Yes, make that emergency trip to buy the Torx T6 if you have to. You have to disassemble the phone. Although reports some devices such as a PalmPilot, has survived in a snowbank for 7 days (luckily, its batteries were dead) after being lost in a snow-filled driveway, it is generally best to disassemble the device quickly. Clean snow/water usually means you can wait a bit longer, but pool water (chlorine) or ocean water (salt) will make is VERY URGENT to dissassemble the phone.    SALT WATER TIP: If exposure was salt water; you may need to clean the salt water with water. (salt water is far more dangerous). This may actually mean washing the circuit board very briefly under filtered water, in order to save its life from salt water (ocean water) before immediately drying it out. This is a last resort, but NECESSARY if your electronic device was immersed in salt water (unless you have access to special electronics cleaning fluid solutions that can get rid of salt water on short notice. Sometimes filtered water is the only thing you have access to, for cleaning salt water ASAP)    Yes, one must get rid of fear of dissassembly! RESIST trying to test the telephone  keep the battery away  until the phone/PDA is disassembled and dried first!    FACT: Water almost never instantly kills a cellphone. You usually still have time to save the phones life, especially if the water is clean!    Water is usually never usually the source of damage in a PDA/cellphone/pager/etc that has been immersed into water. The source of damage is usually the combination of Battery+Water which causes short circuits. If there are any backup batteries inside the cellphone/PDA, those preferably must be removed too. Removing all sources of power immediately (all batteries) is the most important step in rescuing water-logged electronics!    Also, phones that have already been exposed to water for longer periods even with the battery, are more likely to permanently stop working. For example, having been inside pockets of damp clothes or wet bags, or fallen in a rain puddle for an hour without you noticing until too late. However, remove the battery immediately anyway and dissassemble anyway. Sometimes you can still rescue electronics that has been wet with the battery for longer periods, especially if the water was clean and the electronics shut off the battery before it did any short-circuit damage.    Ive had a good success rate in rescuing waterlogged electronics by following the above simple instructions. But to improve your odds, you must act quickly to remove the battery and resist the temptation to reinsert the battery to test, not until at least 24 hours later and after disassembly. If the cellphone/PDA is still wet inside  ZAP. It can take weeks for the inside of a cellphone/PDA to fully dry if you do not disassemble. It can take less than 24 hours to dry if you diassemble first. So dissassemble first!|`|AA11267007	water and electricity don't mix you should just get a new one|`|AA11644641	it would cost more to repair it  just buy a new one  there $79
