79800e8aa542061232982947981d2dffaa	She says something about truth being like a bright light, right? Like the sun. Staring straight into the sun blinds you, but you need the sun, so you can't just cover it up entirely.    The same thing with truth. People should tell the truth, but telling truth really straight hurts people. Like telling your friend what you really think of her new dress. So, tell the truth, but bend it a little, so it doesn't hurt people.|`|BN1xFAzjaa	"Tell the Truth But Tell it Slant"  She was basically saying to tell the truth but to make it more pleasurable to the person you are directing it to.

c8Nah2iCaa	omg Listen To The River Flows In You by Yiruma SHOULD HAVE BEEN BELLAS LULLABY. whoever chose the other peice of crap should be shot.    any song by Yiruma is perfect.

I hope this is useful to you =)|`|IR0muDnHaa	I totally agree. The River Flows In You is by far better than the one in the film as it is the most beautiful song ever written (i've just finished learning to play it on the piano myself) Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata' could have done, (if it wasn't for the fact that Beethoven wrote it instead of Edward) though it is not quite as beautiful as Yirumas song.|`|cm7QojiIaa	Before the movie I use to think of a mix of Claire de Lune and Moonlight Sonata, but I think the one from the move is really beautiful.|`|wqbZbwpBaa	I prefer Kiss the Rain myself.

He's awesome xD|`|QtyRuxJnaa	I would have to say Edward Cullen. The reason for this is because we all know that he cant live in the world without Bella, and she's miserable without him. However, i do like Jacob because i started to get a lot of respect for him in Breaking Dawn. I liked him in New Moon because he helped Bella out and then in Eclipse wen he helped protect her. he was sometimes cocky, which i didn't like, but then in breaking dawn, i got a lot of respect for him. but Edward is perfect for Bella and they just cant live without each other. if i had to choose teams, i would be team Switzerland, but i would lean more on Team Edward. but as far as Jacob Black or Edward Cullen, id say Edward. Besides, Jacob is more of a best friend for Bella, and it seems like its always been that way, therefor, they were meant to stay friends.|`|hSSVkiZTaa	I love Jacob Black. He has all the cute qualities I like in a guy. But in regards to the story, I'd say he isn't right with Bella as more than a friend. Edward is definitely hers. Just my opinion.

38eb78ef54653766c3ca71d79051901caa	If it's for school, I don't really have much to say except you spelled "characters" wrong.  Other than that, it looks fine to me.  There may be typos and other errors in there but I did not read the entire thing, so I can not say for sure.    As a story, it's rather bland.  I would not read past the first paragraph because nothing exciting or compelling is happening.      This piece sounds more like an observation.  Is this what you were going for?|`|AjqO1aJgaa	To be honest, it makes me feel like this is a platform for you to express your own beliefs and not a story at all. It's also completely implausible that someone would be so eloquent and so clear the _very first time_ they challenged an authority figure. And however could someone who'd decided to take such a strong stance on not acknowledging the pledge never have realised how it would look unpatriotic?    It also seemed deeply unlikely that a new student would be given detention for their very first offence - how does she even know he's a US citizen?     You need to add those requirements into your story - not just have your character spout them as a plot dump.    Note: I'm not American, so this has nothing to do with my own beliefs.|`|sYyNyjwuaa	it wont let me answer can i email you?  i think its too long
1nC4fVw3aa	sorta because its like vampires and werewolves so i guess and they are fighting over Bella|`|v011fxgraa	Yes, Jacob Edward's enemy is in the book Twilight.  He has the part where he is talking with Bella at the beach about some myths of vampires.   Jacob has a main role part in the next book "New Moon". You must read all four books.|`|6r5GOd8yaa	sort of... they are fighting over bella, and in that case they are enemies. also they are traditionally enemies, being vampires and werewolves. however they dont really HATE each other.|`|8JFMEtTEaa	They were enemies because Jacob is a were wolf and Edward is a vampire. Vampire's are not supposed to associate with Werewolves (long story). They both also love Bella. But in Eclipse (3rd book) they become acquaintances.|`|Aj16de8Aaa	No he is not. They are fighting over Bella but they eventually get over it. At parts you could say that they are but Edward has bigger enemies.|`|FBMDK4lHaa	by the end of breaking dawn edward refers to jacob as his son so clearly they aint enemies by the end but in twilight yeah i guess so|`|sdSpplGwaa	No.. kinda    so jacob is a werewolf and edward is a vampire and werewolves are the only things that can kill a vampire so technically they are but in the fourth book edward and jacob sort of become friends.

And when we all write together it's a beautiful synthesis. Maddamselfly - are you going to put that poem together? I'd love to see what came out of it.

And, it might not be a bad idea to have someone you know read over what you wrote for positive suggestions and ideas.

It may not seem like it, but you have written a lot.     However, if you don't even know where it's going from here, you have some serious revision to go over. You're the one writing a story, so let me ask you this: What's it about? So far you've only given a little bit of the story, and so far it's kept me wondering what's really going on. However, in order to help you improve I need a little bit of background information on the plot. Otherwise, I could be telling you the wrong thing, and end up looking absentmided myself!     Chapters, in my perspective, are basically puzzle pieces to the end. There must be significant details in which support the main idea. Obviously, Analeigh meeting this boy is pretty important. Email me and give further details so I know what I'm talking about? Lol.|`|TPBDESp5aa	hmmm, it was interesting.  I feel as if I started reading in the middle of a page though...for a rough draft it was interesting, but if you want to pursue it further, I think a bit more thought and fixing needs to be done.    **I just read the second post, and I do have to agree, this did remind me of twilight as well! lol    **well, if you ever need help or want an opinion, feel free to email me and I will help as much as I can...But if writing does interest you, you should try and take some creative writing classes. I took two in high school and am in one now in my college class, I love them!|`|bj5Hq83uaa	ooo i like it. kinda like twilight in a way lol. hmmmm... i like how ur both opposites but sorry... i dont really like the name noah. and the cookie part is so mediocre. its like a perfect happy family. you should smell the poperei or something idk just not cookies!|`|YGvKisOoaa	pretty good. your writing style is actually better than some books that are out there, truth be told. you definitely should continue, maybe even make this into a 100+ page book?? its good from what ive read. sure, it needs some fixing up, but what book doesnt when its first written. good job, please continue :D|`|aaNZZKLraa	I'm 13 and writing too! Check mine out (:        I think your idea is good, but you're kind of telling and not showing. The reader gets kind of bored. I can't really visualize your description, but it's a good start. For being 13, this is quite good. (LOL, I can't say that, I'm 13 too. Whatever.) Writing takes lots of talent and time...    in time, I believe this could become something great.    Nice job!|`|AA11946101	I think it should be in third person, that way the bookworm could show her speech is unique.   At the very start, you should let people know that she is doing the describing--the "flawless in every way" stopped me. A character could say that, but not the narrator.    Random thought:  After my long walk home I walked...  Repeat words sparingly.|`|AA10711985	this is good! don't throw it away! think about the twist that you want to be in the story is it just normal teenage drama or will something magical happen will he laugh in her face or will she laugh in his? think about that andwrite how you think it should end then continue writing from what you allready have but do not throw this away you might come back to it and get hit with an idea|`|3N6K4NT9aa	That is AAAwesome!! I want to find out what will happen next! Don't start over please! Is there any more coming soon?|`|gKU5Gpgiaa	hmmm...i like it, but its a bit to teen-storyish if u kno wat i mean. plus, it is a little like twilight in the 1st paragraph. a perfect boy with shaggy hair attracted an ordinary, unpopular girl who thinks she is ugly. hmmm....|`|ZXlsxmJmaa	I agree with what alot of people have said, it does seem like we are just reading in the middle of the story, so I'd say add to the beginning, so we understand why she feels this boy is so important and why she likes him so much.  I also do think that there is alot that is like twilight, maybe you could try changing that up just a bit? ( you don't have to, just a thought)...I think that for a 13 year old, it's pretty good, just put some more time and thought into and I think you should have a good piece for school!    if you look on my questions, I have a piece up too, if you would like to read it.
3Nr9o9UDaa	not as of yet however there probly will be when there are more books in the series and the series gets more popular  love the book!|`|KA0Ek4Tyaa	Twilight has really skewed things... honestly, for there to be MERCHANDISE based on a book is extremely rare. Go to a Barnes and Noble. Look around the store and estimate the number of books they have. Out of all of those books, maybe a couple in the teen/children's sections have actual merchandise based on them. And all of those books in the store don't even compare to the actual number of books that have been published at one point or another. There are so many people who have never read a book in their lives and then suddenly they read Twilight and hey, there's Twilight merchandise, it logically follows that there's merchandise for every other book, too. But this is not the case; Twilight is the exception and not the norm.   So to answer your question, no, there is no Hunger Games necklace you can buy. And don't expect there to be merchandise for any book you read, because chances are there isn't going to be any.     Sorry if this came off a little rant-y; I may have gotten a little too angry writing it. But I'm just trying to stress the point that there are far too many books out there for there to be merchandise made for each and every one of them. Another person who answered this question expressed the belief that merchandise for The Hunger Games will probably appear after the book becomes more popular and is turned into a series. May I just say.... no, that doesn't happen, especially with an actual quality novel like The Hunger Games.     Again, sorry for the semi-rant. I hope this does help you in some way.|`|8q4RhpZWaa	     NO|`|pdbc4souaa	Google to the rescue.

uoE2Zvs6aa	i know there gorgeous|`|123z7Ww3aa	Lil Wayne. I 
jbquvpKNaa	your profile is on private hon.|`|0BioKSmaaa	i actually do :D   but i suggest you take them out of your myspace and post them seperately on yahoo...it would make it easier for people to read (most don't like clicking on links)   keep up with the penning tho :D|`|DUpZhTwQaa	they are real good!!
BanUy4I3aa	a billion      (i think)|`|cf4edaf15617b46e94d234ea845ecdebaa	infinite number|`|AA11123061	there are countles colours in wht world . but all colors are made from 3 primary colors . red, yellow,blue .    you cannot count the colors ,th world is just a colorful sphere .|`|658c97c2e40e2eb3b804b250ef53cb21aa	Primary = 3.|`|uapDu8RYaa	The human eye can see 10 million colors.    Your computer in the highest color settings (32 bit) can display 4.2 billion colors.|`|0qSpreVyaa	It depends. How many primary colors? Three, Red, Blue, and Yellow. But i don't think that was your question.    If you were asking in total, there are infinite  combinations of colors. There is no limit on the variations. In fact, it is quite possible that no two colors are exactly alike!    So... hope that helps!|`|BkatcMZbaa	Two sources to note:  1) The color gun of a TV picture tube and the 3 colors to do combination of all colors on TV.   You check what are the 3 colours.    2) Look at the rainbow and count the 7 colors or check the prism for the color rays.......also 7........thatis from light ray.  What are the colors, just do a check.    3) With the basic colors, you can come up with the mixture of colors to form color of your choice.|`|F8Yj3U9caa	a lot but i think there are like 10 but you make other colors out of those|`|8ZmjIYORaa	In the laws of science. It's actually impossible to know in a way.  There is Multi-colored,  You have light brown, dark brown, light blue, dark blue.  It's too much to keep up with. And every year you have differen't types and styles of colors.    Hope I helped for a best answer :)|`|kpTlEW59aa	whites to black and evey shade in between|`|Wj7mBxFJaa	technically there's an infinite amount of colors but there's a limit to what the eye can differentiate.  For example  You can take green and you can make it lighter and lighter in infinitely small increments until its white, or darker the same way until it's black, but the human eye wouldn't be able to tell the difference between many of the shades|`|AA12339318	There are, literally millions, including tints, or lighter or darker variations of the same color.    Not every color has a name, in case you were wondering.
5XJ3Nu8aaa	I suppose all their old hits plus It's not my Time, Citizen/ Soldier, Train, and some more of their new stuff.
JOChNigNaa	Try " put on some music" or "placed a disc in the player", popping in a CD is far too light and casual in tone for a lament, as well as "some junk".  Where the rest of your poem is serious and sombre, those make it sound immature and shallow.  Also don't reverse to hear your voice once more, the reverse order makes it sound stilted.  Rampantly is a good word, but gilds the lily a bit much.  Use more direct language.  Already creates distance, where I miss your voice is poignant.  You left no choice. (us would seem to add an indefinite number of people who've been left, or intimate an attempt at doing other people's thinking.  As Tonto said to the Lone Ranger when surrounded by marauding Indians, "What do you mean 'We', White man!", or "What is that us you're talking about, do you have a mouse in your pocket?") Only is just like just, ask Elaine about that, already is in the same category, words that are filler.  In that line words that make others into derivatives like "of" and "alone".  Cut it to the essential ideas and work from there.    A fire burns within  Untold sadness  Sudden departure  My heart bleeds    A fire burns within  Rage beyond compare  You left no choice  I miss your voice    A fire burns within  Fighting back tears  I play a CD  To hear hear you again    Time alone will heal,  Trash!  Time burns to ash  Leaving memories    BURNING    In my soul.  Missing someone is always an immediate reaction, it will even occur after years.  Mere suggestions, does it not sound more painful?  It's a very good lament.  You're learning well.  [Rampant is a figure, usually an animal, standing up straight, pawing at the air.  Does that fit with a bleeding heart?]|`|0BioKSmaaa	hmm...it is clearly from your heart  im not exactly a critic but I think you may need a few more images in the poem..and there are some lines that feel just a tad bit awkward..like "popping in a CD" felt a little long for a line...other than that..i think this has really great potential giggles...it definitely touched my heart and sometimes that's all a poem has to do :)   keep penning G :)|`|nBjrtIqeaa	Fire burns within is repeated too many times.    I'd at least start it differently in the second verse.    I'd put a dash in this line: "Time alone will heal" - such junk!    Otherwise pretty good.|`|QLYpq7Zhaa	Time....  ........ extinguishes the flames of pain.......|`|T0fwqL2baa	I am sorry for your loss Giggles. In the last stanza...might delete one of those "only" words...too close to each other. Suggest using proper punctuation throughout. That is imperative to be taken seriously (I'm told...).  "popped in a C.D."....needed to express your intent, yet to phrase differently (popped...sounds so casual...and I imagine the c.d. to have great significance to you?) Even "slid", or..A c.d. of your voice, to wash over me...You have a good beginning here. I feel your loss. :-(|`|xxNAq3S1aa	I think such junk! should be its own line but thats just my opinion.  its a really good poem! and its true for me!    if you have time can u read my myspace poems? (they are in my new question) please & thankyou!|`|P5iXwQtJaa	Excellent giggles!  Keep writing!  I would give you an A+ on that poem...Smiles...|`|dw2xJ2tIaa	if sadness is a fiery feeling inside our heart that burn everything into dust, let love be the water that calming that fiery fire...    uh, i dunno what to say ;P|`|7WgGfObkaa	A serious critique:  It's a good poem, but it's important that you make your writing as unique as you can without completely destroying it.  A good way to do this is by coming up with unusual ways to describe things; like 'a green fire burns' or something to give the fire a color and added imagery.  Also, if you can, spend as much time as you can thinking of unique subjects to write about.  Many subjects are overused(love, hate, loneliness, etc), making originality difficult.  The third stanza was a little confusing to me.  Was she popping in a CD to hear the person's voice?      edit-  Okay, it makes more sense now.  I didn't get that it's about a singer.  It must be from a different generation than my own.  In that case, the poem is unique, and my previous comment isn't as important.|`|WbRuTjmFaa	I agree, that SUCH JUNK should be more emphatic and perhaps also be in quotation marks and own its own line..   I think the second verse you go into rhyme and it detracts me from the cold fire that the rage was lighting...   popping in a CD is odd...  OMG  am I critiquing? I do not do that..!   oh well I have gone and done..   I do not mean to be harsh, but,I think this deserves more attention    (slipped in a disc?) (slipped a disc in the player)
V87NaMXDaa	Winter is such a hard time to write joyful stuff of any sort, especially in February, mid-struggle towards spring. I applaud your poetic effort to see the future. <br>  <br>  To make it more crisp, I would suggest removing some of the articles that lend to flow but cloud the message a little bit. Try reading the second stanza like this.<br>  <br>  Breathe deep, close your eyes,<br>  feel Spring breaking forth.<br>  Smell the trees awakening<br>  as snow looses hold...<br>  <br>  I don't mean to rewrite you, forgive me if I have overstepped my bounds.<br>  Love~Eva|`|Mgg5vcdOaa	Sounds to me like you've licked your slump and spring is on the way.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	Keep writing and you'll break out. What you have here is good - I like Evadne's suggestions though.|`|1lCUPVAkaa	You've stared to roll keep going..........Soon winter will pass, it certainly<br>  had a tight fisk on us this season.|`|oKsKKxeaaa	Oh, to breathe the air and no longer sting my nostrils...I wait for Spring so I no longer have to "see" myself exhale...<br>  <br>  I loved the "feel" of this and give a heartfelt two thumbs up !  (still with gloves on, though...my hands are cold  :)|`|wLupiz7raa	come to India we have plenty of sunshine here ,i have never seen a snowfall maybe you can send some here, while i send some sunshine to your place|`|n9hRyHpqaa	I am waiting just like you.<br>  One change I would make is the use of the word, the, too often.  It makes for stumbling lines. th,th,th  Know what I mean?  I need to watch it too.  Other than that, nicely penned.|`|uTM2L1Eraa	I see no slump here,<br>  only inspiration to look ahead.<br>  <br>  Well done,<br>  ma
m65OF6bGaa	Yup, pretty much just to play the notes extremely fast in one big arpeggiated stroke, which is accessible and fluid, I do it when warming up it's really fun to be behind that fast sound.    I think it's impressive, but does nothing for me melodically, I wouldn't advise getting into the habit of playing as fast a porridgy like Yngwie Malmsteem or Michael Angelo Batio, it really does bore people after 2 minutes or less of listening.    But yeah, really, just to make people go "awweeee, he's awesome dude!!" :)|`|hJP9y6kjaa	Sweep picking has a very fluid, flowing sound to it. I think it sounds almost like a rushing river - the notes are liquid and rush past you.    So it's a different texture to the notes. Sometimes I think it's awesome - but if it's done too much it can be a little overwhelming (think Dragonforce). I appreciate dynamics in music - so sometimes there should be fewer notes, sometimes more. Too much sweep picking pulls away from how awesome it can be.    Bursting into some sweep picking at the height of a kick-a** solo can be really awesome, though!        Saul|`|uapDu8RYaa	"Compared to other techniques often used by shredders, such as alternate picking, few strokes are required in sweep picking"
b2d2004dec765febfc0780f19334a6f0aa	hmmm I'm a bboy and I sometimes cwalk, but I've never done that.  but, (lol this is random) I play volleyball, and we constantly brush the bottom of our shoes when playing.  This is because dust builds up on your shoes and it gets slippery.  When you brush it off, your shoes get more traction, which gives you more control.  It's probably the same with cwalkers.  hope i helped :]
Wme29krvaa	They're just friends. Nothing more. -shudders- Even though they could be brothers.

01828ba3a2ceab3b3b6ed1d24349e9d6aa	No, I cant write songs on demand....    As a Songwriter...you wait for the song to come to you....  you dont chasing down a song...because it wont come to you unless you surrender yourself to it and yield to it. I've tried chasing down songs before and they always escaped me and I suffered severe "Writers Block" for a few years in the 1990s...so I basically just backed off for a while....then it came to me slowly, little by little...over time.    With a song, you have to be very, very patient with it and wait for it to come to you...|`|TJHfkN6gaa	sometimes it comes to me and i just think wow   but other times i think of something to wright|`|5XJ3Nu8aaa	It either comes to me or it doesn't. Most of the time it doesnt'.|`|PShlj7Lxaa	I can do songs randomly but most of the time it's through inspiration, or something can just pop into my head.|`|joA5Rcyzaa	most of the time i'll just be screwing around on guitar and then something will sound good and one thing leads to another
heLkdzeuaa	ballets more elegant, graceful, peaceful id say  and hip hops more upbeat and energizing|`|Eby3T7BJaa	I feel ballet is more feminine, slow and good to look at.  I feel breakdancing is more masculine, fast, intense.
HNACLCazaa	Run in place for 20 mins. a day for week and every 5 mins. change the speed up and thats basically helps you become swifter!|`|b2d2004dec765febfc0780f19334a6f0aa	one word : practice  just plain exercise helps out, but actually dancing helps the most.  Your transitions may be choppy because your body is simply not used to moving in that way.  Its like trying to write with your left hand (if ur right handed).  But if you keep practicing, you'll get used to it and you'll be able to do the moves smoother.  In my experience, I sucked at toprocking (uprock) when I started out.  I kept listening to breakbeats to build rhythm and I always practiced toprock.  I even practiced when washing dishes. lmao.  anyways the point is keep practicing.  the more work you put into anything, the better youll be at it.  good luck.|`|Eby3T7BJaa	Lose all your fat if you are overweight and practice your core  For losing fat, use running excercises. Its better to be outside since you have somewhere to run.  For practicing your core, use lots of Crunches and Sit ups. After learning regular sit ups, use variations like the criss cross sit ups and such.  After that, just practice your moves to be faster. Right now I am working on my six step and it is choppy and slow as well. I'm trying this routine and its working out great.|`|FyAGwtA1aa	Wanna know the secret?    Zealous practice. Haha I know that's not the best advice but sometimes that's what you have to hear... or read in this case.    To be straight up honest, about 80% of your fluidity and your swift skillz in the battle circle comes from practice beforehand and all those hours and days you spent perfecting your dance and all that. One of the keys to dancing in my opinion is to practice until it feels natural. Once you get that down, it will become alot easier and more fluid, you don't want your dance to be forced. When it's forced then that's when you start to look sloppy or choppy and etc.    Your transitions can be fixed in bboying by learning a good freeze or something because that's what alot of bboys like to do that i've seen so far.    just gotta start off slow, work your way up, and practice practice practice. visualize yourself getting it, watch alot of videos for inspiration, and hit the cardboard. xD

DI9wXRVgaa	If time is on your side, I would rent the A&E Biography Video. It's Mark Twain's biography and it was shown on A&E (Channel 128) last night where I live. There was nothing else on and I was too lazy to change the channel:  http://www.cyberflix.ca/details.asp?Movi...    Twain was an interesting, witty, and fair guy that people of any age would like even today. Most of the stuff written about him is flat out boring because writers try to incorporate his literary works with the chronology of Twain's life.  http://www.gradesaver.com/author/mark-tw...    The A&E Bio showed a side of Twain that wasn't stilted or like all the other dry bios about him. Twain was witty, candid and kind of a bad boy of his time. He never graduated from school but received an honorary doctorate from Oxford University in 1907. He was a real character. He wore it over the white suit he was famous for (always with a cigar)  to his  daughter's wedding and she was horrified:  http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/british/imag...    He married a beautiful woman named Olivia and they had three children. He went through periods of prosperity and lived well (despite some of his writings for the common man). But at 60 he fell on hard times. Some wealthy guy invested in him and sent him on a round the world tour and this helped his career.     Twain was poud to be one of the first homes in Amercia with his own, indoor telephone. But when asked if he would invest in the telephone, he declined reasoning, why would he, since is one of the few people who has one?!    He grew up with slavery and initially he wasn't surprised he had accepted it so easily since it was 'the way of his world' but as he became more traveled and knowledgeable about the nature of man and equality but immediately changed his views.   http://www.gradesaver.com/author/mark-tw...    This link has a lot of info on SC aka MT as well as more links:  http://classiclit.about.com/od/twainmark...    There are enough links on the internet that should enable you to come up with a decent paper. Good Luck :)|`|5478d54ea53fcef0ef93502a7e237c89aa	GOOGLE Samuel Clemens   GOOGLE Mark Twain  You'll come up with many websites that give you biographical information.

MSEyXHFWaa	Only if he writes manly things in it. Like bear wrassling, face-shaving, chest hair growing, and whatever else it is that manly men do.    Doodling hearts in the margins is right out.       Really, it's just a record of events. It's fun to look back and remember things that you've forgotton. Writing things down shouldn't be an affront to someone's manliness; even if they are doodling hearts.|`|0WKkXIyKaa	yes its fine.    he can look back in it of the future and be amazed at himself.|`|UspK4SQBaa	A long is it's not stolen.

Some very distinguished authors over the centuries have kept journals or diaries.  You should try it yourself.|`|dcgvXLbaaa	Yes it's just a good way to vent and release your feelings.|`|IGz2wBj5aa	Diary = Journal. He probably just enjoys writing. Some of the most musicians, actors, etc. keep diaries. Kurt Cobain and John Lennon are two good examples. Writing is a good way to pass the time.|`|EbIXilnpaa	I don't really think there's anything wrong with it, but he might wanna keep the fact that he has one a secret.  He could always call it a journal instead of a diary...sounds less girly.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Ya.. its fine.|`|By1DJAUOaa	it is def okay for a guy to have a diary b/c sometimes people are sensitive, emotional or they even talk a lot and they can't keep their mouth shut and they know a diary can;t tell them to shut up, but i have one and they are fun, i write in mine right before i go to bed to tell how my day went and look forward to another day.|`|nBjrtIqeaa	Yup I wish I had made a journal. I rely on memory which is pretty good but nothing like a journal to remember all the good times. You go through so many friends and fun in your life that remembering them accurately is cool. I should have also taken more photos to match up with the written adventures.|`|PGmcLovfaa	Screw whether to call it a "diary" or a "journal"--I know a lot of girls think guys who write are hot.

They are meant to keep your private thoughts that you can't tell people and a way to express yourself without being humiliated or taunted by others.|`|N5Iyltigaa	The word Diary sounds so girly, but really writting about events in ones life, has no gender|`|vCWyJFhsaa	Perfectly fine for a guy to have a diary, I do, and I find it's very helpful. It gives you something to do, helps you clear your mind and is almost therapeutic. It's a common misconception that a diary is a "girl" thing, you would be surprised at how many guys have diaries, though most probably just call them a journal.|`|kGTvJS4paa	Why wouldn't it be okay for a guy to have a diary? Everyone needs a way to express how they feel, just cause its on paper and he's a guy doesn't mean anything. I personally think its a good thing.|`|bldzLsmkaa	well... unless your gay call it a journal.. and no theres nothing wrong with it.. .well just make sure its not like purple and fuzzy or ne thing lol jk|`|AriQGdsFaa	Of course. Its perfectly normal for either a male or a female to keep a diary. Despite what people think about the difference in gender, it is just as perfectly normal for a guy to express emotions or write in a diary as it would be for a girl.    Oh dear, and incase anyones has homophobic thoughts...no, a guy having a diary does not make him gay. He doesnt need to call it a journal either, really, because they are exactly the same thing. Im a girl and I have a journal. Sometimes I call it a diary. Go figure...|`|9de253f092d1cc279c1330f75282b4b4aa	Nothing at all wrong with it.  Noting down the lessons of his day or the experiences of his life time is perfectly fine.  Although it is commonly pointed out as a feminine practice, this guy may be actually smart enough to keep this memoir as a reminder of his life time and a memory to pass on or remember interesting things.  Maybe it is a book of lyrics or poems, filled with passion and desires.  You never know;)|`|BSKJdZK3aa	men keep diaries    i keep a diary in my laptop about videogames|`|MqTmKCEfaa	of course.

QusqTXCaaa	The Germans did not have specialised landing craft for Operation Sealion. They were planning on using Rhine river barges.  As a result, they were not planning on bringing any artillery or tanks to invade Britain.<br>  <br>  So the Luftwaffe was needed to act as flying artillery, to support landing German soldiers.<br>  <br>  The Kreigsmarine would have been outnumbered by the Royal Navy, by a ratio of 5:1.  While the Battle of Britain nearly exhausted Fighter Command, Bomber Command was still fresh.<br>  <br>  Also, Dowding had planned to move a fighter group to the Midlands, to air fields at Cosford and Half Penny Green, hence out of fighter escort range for German air raids on British airfields.  This was so that Britain would still have some fighter cover in the event of an invasion bid by Germany.<br>  <br>  So the Lufftwaffe was needed to defend the Rhine barges from the Royal Navy, Bomber Command, and win air supremacy against Fighter Command.  <br>  <br>  Part of the plan of Operation Sealion was that the Luftwaffe would bomb London intensively enough to cause the Londoners to flee the city, and clog up the road network in South East England.  <br>  <br>  The Luftwaffe were also to bomb the railway lines around South East England.  All this was intended to prevent the British from getting troops and equipment to fight the landing Germans.<br>  <br>  So to sum up, the Luftwaffe had to:<br>  <br>  Help the Kreigsmarine defend the Rhine Barges from the Royal Navy.<br>  Defend the Rhine Barges from the RAF.<br>  Bomb the city of London.<br>  Bomb the rail network.<br>  Act as flying artillery to support the beach landings.|`|AA11657414	when Napoleon was massing his invasion barges in France in 1804.....the same river coastal unseaworthy designed tubs the Wehrmacht would have used 135 years later.....the First Lord of the Admiralty was asked in Parliament about the danger of invasion.

Without air supremacy..defined as "we own the air and can do whatever we like and the other guys cant do bupkus'.....the Royal Navy would have slaughtered any invasion force.<br>  <br>  I read somewhere a quote from a British destroyer Captain of the time, something to the effect that we would shoot our main battery till the rounds were gone, then the anti aircraft machine cannon till those rounds were gone.

This is because they knew that they could never hope to win a full on naval battle because the Royal Navy was much larger and better equipped than the German navy and the Royal Navy needed to be destroyed or else they would just blow the troop carriers out of the water.|`|d9f297647631bbfef114d9c411c59106aa	Of course, control of the air was vital in any modern day warfare, elementary.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	cuz its good to try 2 wear em down wit bombs 1st. then go for the land invasion

But its going to take a loooong time to move anywhere, so we could send robots first to change the atmosphere.<br>  <br>  The other problem is travelling to such a place... with current tech and what we believe current laws of physics... it would take us hundreds or thousands of years to reach another planet.... <br>  <br>  So the first step in "leaving" would be building massive space ships/cities capable of supporting sustained life for multiple generations of humans.<br>  <br>  The other alternative is a way to freeze people for the whole trip....

But, it seems our technology is improving exponentially since our human's stone age; and hopefully we could invent a "warp drive" technology to make faster-than-light space travel happens (according to sci-fi star trek time line the first warp flight happen on 5 April 2063).<br>  <br>  In my opinion, MONEY as one of human's inventions, is setting back our progress on technology. <br>  <br>  Our population is increasing day by day, but the Earth seems shrinking on natural resources and places to live.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	In the English language, your proposition must be referring to a plural noun as we can see from your use of 'all'.  Though as a singular the word 'perch' might refer to either a fish or a stand, the plural 'perch' can only refer to fish.  So your friend's counterargument is false unless he has derived himself a new language that is NOT English.<br>  <br>  Your statement, then, is analytic if part of the core definition of the 'perch' you are referring to includes the quality of being a fish.  Looking up the biological definition of 'perch' does seem to include this among the many qualities necessary to be considered that kind of creature.  So I would give the argument to you.|`|44ujDxwqaa	Yes it is. If we construct an opposing proposition which would be then: ``All fish are perch`` it becomes unthinkable and invalid, because of the equivocal meanings of the word`perch. A self-evident proposition becomes so if the opposing proposition is not valid or unimaginable grammatically and constructively.<br>  The doctrines of Leibnitz ``each for itself`in such a way that they lost relation to the system as a whole ( a statement starting from single word) through ultra-logical proceeding by definition and distinction.  On the basis of your given proposition, the  word `perch`` loses its other meaning aside from that meaning pertaining to only `fish`.<br>  <br>  In english grammar and usage, no it does not violate, but it is an exception to the rule. It is not a form of equivocation. The fallacy of of equivocation directly targets a reader with the statements hving  equivocal or ambiguous meanings. An example is: If you asked this question "Have you stopped beating up your wife yet?" if you answered yes, it means to say that you abused your wife, and if you answered no, it means you are still abusing your wife, which is a lose-lose situation. It is the main goal of this fallacy to target readers with confusion.|`|123cb0f60a65c8151ec27e589a993e7faa	Yes,it sounds "anaylitic-deterministic" to me.<br>  <br>   It also sounds...very much like...a neo-darwinian biology statement;<br>   i have nothing against "biology"(except to say that those who think that the man-animal does not need MORE constraint-to constrain his procreation,wilful encroachment on the environment,not-to-mention-our likely-dangerous-influence-on-the-icecap... neo-biologists/apologists too are completely mistaken)but its "alighment" with a so-called best/fittest and educationally sterile animalistic story is inappropriate in this our 21st century.<br>  As you say, you have heard some (quasi-students)say that "perch are NOT fish";you should tell him to swim back to his old college and repeat that to his teachers! Perhaps he "misheard"them!!<br>   And if you are or have been "getting into" Leibnitz's work,i would make sure that you "follow up".<br>   What i mean is this;many years ago i read fist hand some of the (then)exciing,cutting edge and unique work of karl Popper;anyway,he went on to say that a lot of philosophy is "in-bred";meaning that a large section of tutors,students and lecturers are more-or-less forced or required to take-on-board what certain writers meant,or even what they implied.<br>   And this can and does produce a willing audience-a rather subservient one,which then "go on" to become extricably linked with,on the bad side,minutae-analytical-verbiage,whilst on the good side i will prefer not to say here.<br>   i found this to be much-the-case when i was at college(studying an arts degree called the History of Ideas(the almost only good part of this was the -limited- multi-disciplinary coure makeup!);and possibly things have got even worse.<br>  So,i say again,try and try again to follow-up;especially on controvercial and genuinely clear writers;for these "clear" writers are sometimes not-at-all followers of philosophic fashions,or "schools";in fact,like Popper,they may well have something NEW,relevant and even...dare i say it..."critical" to say about the contemporary "path" that is likely-to-unfold in human education/(al insight).

b9e17f1222430e55dd4de26ca13cde6caa	First of all, congratulations, it is increasingly difficult in today's world to not value your self worth on whether or not you are in a relationship. It sounds as if you will both know when the time arrives to move forward, whether it be with a kiss, or a hug or whatever. I would recommend you talk about your relationship at least a little bit. Let him know you value him, and hope that the relationship continues, and that if he ever wants to talk about moving forward, you're ready to listen. Again congratulations!
2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	The very best romantic relationship you can have is with a good friend, someone you've come to know and trust.  It's best to let things come at their own pace and in their own timing.  Forcing something to happen can have negative results.  Enjoy your friend, enjoy your time, let the relationship continue to blossom.  You will know when it is time for more and either he will act or you will - it could even be a simple slip, like saying goodbye when you are together, and you could simply give him a little kiss, or the reverse.  You seem to be very wise and I wish you lots of luck - and tell you that I'm almost envious, you have something wonderful brewing, please enjoy it.  And know this, it's not just about sex, it's about caring.|`|gspTDufpaa	Just continue to enjoy the time spent together. Always let him know how much you appreciate him as well.|`|rd6FhBBBaa	Well, sounds you like you two have a good mental connection. This is very good for long term status. But if you want him to be completely into you, take my advice. Catch him off guard on night. Throw yourself at him, and make love like you have been deprived of it your whole life. Have the wildest craziest sex imaginable. Trust me, he will be under your spell. Im a guy, and I LOVE it when the woman takes charge in the bedroom. I guarantee he will fall in love with you. It drives us crazy!|`|b37wqowbaa	Take it slow! Very slow. If youre having fun with it, continue to be friends. You dont want to scare him off. If youre not sure what he wants out of it, just stay friends and let him make the move. DO NOT do anything that you dont want to. It will just cause problems later.|`|o4T0dScfaa	Just be yourself and move at your own pace. Let him know how you feel, if he doesn't understand... he is not the right one for you! If he understands, he sounds like someone worthy enough. Getting to know a person, before becoming physically intimate, is always the better route... friends first!

Ow3O7h4caa	If you have the correct wiring diagram which I am sure. How about the pots??????????????????????????????????//<br>  What  value are you using. On an Eric J (BTW, I love his style and always jam with his CD ), he uses the 375k pots and NOT the standard Fenders 250K. This helps keep the input of the amp or preamp from loading down the guitar and changing its tonal characteristics.<br>  <br>  You can go up to 500K pots but not suggested as these pots work better on humbuckers. :-))<br>  Also, he uses specially - designed custom pickups which, you can get at Seymour Duncan. LOL . But, try the pots first because 250k and 375k will give you two different tones.

92vDzK54aa	Don't you just hate how half the people out there are determined to be so negative on "Twilight"? I don't understand why they bother to insult our tastes... <br>  <br>  Anyways. "Harry Potter" was my first "Book Obsession" and I still love them dearly. <br>  <br>  "His Dark Materials" I have heard is a good substitution when you have 'Post-Potter Depression', so I assume it would work well for Twilight too. <br>  <br>  I am going to start The Host today, which I have heard is very much like Twilight (seeing as it is also by Stephenie Meyer), in how much you fall in love with it. I've been told it is very good and I am very excited to read it. <br>  <br>  Anne Rice's novels I have been told are good, I plan on starting those soon too. <br>  <br>  This is a little off the track you are searching for, but I have a hard time letting go of series, I feel like if I start new books I am betraying them , so if you are the same, light novels are good just to escape the same old thing. In which case I would suggest "I Am America (and so can you!)"<br>  <br>  My major suggestion is to not look TOO hard. The good books tend to come to you. I might look up "ten books to read before you die" or something like that, it is nice to be able to have read the "classics". And they are obviously suggested frequently for a reason. But it all depends on your tastes. I am sure there are more Vampire Love stories out there if that is the exact specific you are looking for. Or do you prefer Stephenie's writing style instead of the story?<br>  <br>  Hope you find something good.|`|JbPGX2Adaa	I've tried several vampire related series lately and the best was Vampire Academy. Its not finished yet cause there will be two more books in th series set to be published in 2009 and 2010. But it really was very good. I really liked the Twilight series but i don't in a any case consider it a supreme book series; just an enjoyable one. Vampire Academy was very enjoyable too but it has a totally different tone to it. Let's say that if Meyers was Jane Austen then Richelle Mead is definitelly a Jackie Collins. And i would totally suggest you stay away from the Vampire Diaries which will be developed to a series by the CW next year cause it was sooooo boring.|`|uNC5VtD3aa	Yes!!<br>  <br>  same genre series that are good <br>  The shifters series by Rachel Vincent (stray, rogue, pride)<br>  Gena Showalters series about greek mythogology in modern times is good to. <br>  <br>  Twilight is a good series but Meyer wrecked it for me with the last book, its abit like marmite i think you either love it or you hate it.|`|KBDpzAK2aa	The City of Ember series-By Jeanne Duprau<br>  <br>  1st bk) City of Ember<br>  2nd) The People of Sparks<br>  3rd) The Prophet<br>  4th) The Diamond of Darkhold<br>  <br>  Losing Christina Series-Caroline B.

I suggest you just find new books to read. I know you feel like Harry Potter must be the only series of novels you'll ever like (I was in your shoes), but just keep looking and you'll find another good novel or series. That's what happened to me.    The thing about fanfiction is that they're written by amateurs, and a lot of the times by kids who haven't read many books to begin with. The characters don't even feel the same. No research has been done to make the setting believable. They are not very good in other words.     Either stick to the original, or find a new book.|`|BvRH65wmaa	As a writer of fanfic myself, I can't help but feel mildly insulted by your question, but as A reader of fanfic, I can understand your point.  Lots of Fanfic are written by armatures, people who just want to write a three scene long story.  To find good fanfics, you should look for people who are serious about writing.  any one on Fanfiction.net who has over two hundred thousand words written should be readable, if they are serious about writing.  I write fanfic to practice writing.  Good luck in your search.|`|gFkNVxywaa	See if you can find a fanfiction site where the submissions are voted on and ranked by readers. Then you'll be able to sort by ranking and only read those considered the best.

kgX8Qlmhaa	Generally, people do not have as good of an idea of what they look like compared to what others in their lives look like, simply because we do not spend as much time looking at ourselves as we do looking at others.

A mirror could work, but it would be very difficult to create a portrait and stay still enough to sit for one all at the same time.|`|BJERgbM5aa	I don't think that realism is the object of any artist.

When I draw  myself I find that using a photo reference is the easiest way but drawing in front of a mirror is probably the best for practice. My teachers always advise me to draw from life. I wouldn't recommend trying to draw oneself without any reference though. Then you'll miss all the little details that makes a drawn portrait great. :]|`|A6D0OkD7aa	You could go of a photograph, but this won't be as realistic as using a mirror. To use a mirror, get one that will stand up on a table or desk. Put it in front of you (behind the paper) and adjust it so that it will be easy to work from.
n9Wu1Omxaa	I have no clue. I don't even understand the need to make a sequel to Phantom. That's just pointless. I feel no matter what lyricist he used and no matter how he writes this sequel, it would never be as good or even compare to the original Phantom. It's obvious his biggest and most successful production was Phantom of the Opera and he's probably trying to make something else just as successful, but unfortunately making a sequel to Phantom isn't go to do that for him, ha-ha. He should either think of something completely new and different (which is what i'd like to see on Broadway) or just deal with the fame he has and will continue to have by making The Phantom of The Opera into a musical.

0l98mcf3aa	Dear God! I'm amazed at the shallowness of people.  The film was a bit of a bore. Okay, many films are. I wonder who'll be watching it in, say, the year 3009.  The asker clearly doesn't have a great knowledge of the topic, referring to the original work as a 'book'.  The original is known as 'The Iliad' and is believed to have been written by Homer. (I hope to god no-one refers to the Simpsons after this or my hope for humanity will be crushed.) The Iliad has been around for a couple of thousand years or so, and it's still regarded as a classic.  So, the easy answer is: The Iliad ... what you call the 'book'.  Bloody hell!|`|AA12379904	Never read the book but it must be better than the film.What reels of crap.|`|zYZIw0Mqaa	Well as the book was written about two and a half thousand years ago, and is still a top book today, i'd say the book. The film just missed out too much, and took the story to a place it wasn't meant to go. It was about Odysseus and his struggle to what is right for his country or for himself.|`|K7N0pkU8aa	Troy the film!|`|c01eb38fba09582c78fbc7a2a19baeb0aa	The book, "Troy"?  Was no book "Troy".  There is an ancient poem that has come down to us from pre-Golden Age Greece, ascribed to a man named Homer, called the Illiad, from which the events of the movie were drawn.  The poem in translation is not easy reading.  There have been countless "re-writes" into prose, none of which has attained any particular distinction, but  it is useful to know that you can read the story in plain English, or any of the, probably thousands of  translated retellings.                                     Nevertheless, if we're giving out awards here, I think we have to go with the Illiad poem.  It is unlikely in the extreme that 26, 2700 years from now, people will be critiqueing Brad Pitts deathless performance and wondering how it lasted the ages, or why his wine dark eyes (yeah, I know, they're blue) are so compelling.|`|fQmJSlEyaa	Books are always better than the films .A lot more detail in books .

The film, very loosely follows the poems text, of the life of Achilles, whom was dipped in the river Styx, to make him invincible, except for the heel, with which he was held.  The film is good, but of no comparison to Homers original.  Not to put too finer point on it, 50 years time the film will be forgotten, The Iliad has survived since around 9bc.  Read it, it's excellent,try Odyssey too.
HlgcJ3FLaa	Yeah! I never noticed that, but it seems really likely. Maybe Rowling was inspired by Heathcliff when she was writing Snape. He's always been my favorite character in Harry Potter, even before the 7th book. [I dressed up as him for Halloween last year, but it didn't really work because I am a girl and I am Indian and wore a plastic haircutting cape as a cloak. (:  ]   And other similarities: Heathcliff and Snape both really hated the husbands. And both Cathy and Harry ended up trapped or indebted to Heathcliff and Snape. (Harry during Occlumency and Cathy when she was forced to marry Linton.) Both had terrible childhoods. And both appear completely evil but their redeeming quality is their love.  I liked Snape better, though. I think he was slightly less evil.|`|x38sIvyxaa	Yes! I actually wrote an essay on that a couple of months ago.  Well, actually, the essay compared Wuthering Heights to HP7, but the major emphasis was on the Lily/James/Snape vs. Catherine/Edgar/Heathcliff love triangles.|`|pQGUPITeaa	Yes definitely - they are both romantic anti-heroes.    I'm sure Heathcliff was an inspiration for Snape.|`|XMXlXu0xaa	I haven't read Wuthering Heights but have heard lots of stuff about it, and know the main plot.  That is a really interesting and good observation. I probably would never have noticed something like that. I love Harry Potter and it's funny that a coincidence like that would come up.|`|eiGIwridaa	i just noticed it! it is similar! but Heathcliff is more attractive than Snape. but yeah! i soo agree with you!
hl4kkvXhaa	A comp card consists of your head shot, three quarter shot, and full body shot, along with your bodily statistics.  I don't know how much they cost these days, but about ten years ago, they cost almost $800 for about 1000 cards.      Just be sure to watch what these guys are doing.  A lot of these agencies will tell everyone they can model...which is true basically...but what they mean is that they will charge you for the classes and photo shoots and portfolios, and you never get a job...when you try to sue, they say they never promised you'd be a model...just that they'd give you the skills and tools you'd need.  Barbizon, and anyone affiliated with them, have used this for years to rip people off ("Become a model...or just look like one").    Basically, any agency that wants you to sign a contract without letting you read all the fine print or taking it to a lawyer (always ask that they allow you to and watch their reaction), or expect you to put a ton of money in or try to guarantee they'll find work for you is basically a scam.      Not trying to dissuade...just trying to make sure you know what you may be in for.  I've never heard of One Source, but I left modeling years ago, and don't really keep up with the industry anymore.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Watch out. Don't trust anyone that charges you money to send out your pictures.

It really depends on where you get them taken at.|`|HNc93WVoaa	Models and actors send out head shots. Models also use portfolios and composite (or comp) cards, which is like a business card in the modeling industry.  The pictures need to be professionally photographed to be taken seriously and you can get copies made for cheap at walmart or staples. You can get some inexpensive photos taken at a walmart Portrait studio or a JCPenny Portrait studio.    I hope I helped!|`|d2RRTIXZaa	Are they called comp cards? As in composite?
a4zo8RnOaa	You should go for it! Ballet is for everyone, you don't have to be a certain age. If you work hard and stay dedicated, you can become an amazing dancer, competition/company good I'm sure.    Pointe can be hard, it requires a lot of strength and it isn't for everyone. Work hard and build the strength you need and I'm sure you'll get your pointe shoes soon enough. You have to have good technique and dedication for pointe, but if you really want it, it'll come.  Good luck!|`|hpqkNuloaa	As the saying goes, it's NEVER TOO LATE!! :) there's a lady that dances @ my school and she's like 50- something not rly sure of her age,  but she's like really good and graceful and only danced for about 4 years! Remember, don't let anything hold you back!! so of course you can dance!! i say go for it. but most of all, HAVE FUN!! :)|`|ITZRv0XGaa	yeah sure  You can learn anything and be good at it at any age  well maybe people 75 and older :)|`|1gf0BwcXaa	I've heard about dance classes for beginning teens.|`|BewDjhcZaa	yeahh it is possible see if any studios near you have a teen ballet class to start with and as you get better get into a more advsnced class and you can still get into competition at your age i know a few people who started 2 years ago at 15 and are en pointe now i hope you do it because ballet is rele beautiful and i love it|`|DKJ8sjxVaa	My sister started dancing when she was 21 or 22 years old, and now (about 10 years later) she's passed grade 5 of Ceccheti! (which means she's a "real" dancer supposedly, lol)     Go for it! And have fun!! It's hard work, but it's worth it, my sister's in love with ballet!
a4zo8RnOaa	The thing to remember about pointe, is every studio is different, and each person is different.    The standard age for pointe is 13, but it doesn't mean as soon as your 13 you get shoes. You have to have the strength, technique, and dedication. If your really young, or have poor technique or your too weak you can severly injure yourself, and it will affect the rest of your life.    Pointe work can be very fun, I enjoy it. Some girls don't though, it can be painful at times and that discourages a lot of girls. Now, being good depends on how hard your working, your teacher and time. Some progress faster than others, it's just a fact of life. Your not going to be good at first, but with time and practice you'll get a lot better!|`|hpqkNuloaa	I take pointe lessons about 2 hours a day.. but for beginners, about 1 hour that's how I started and when I improved, I started to dance longer hours en pointe. But you know don't stress yourself too much, it's gonna take time.. So take it slow.. Pointe shoes overall, you will likely feel discomfort the first time because you're just getting the feel of it's hardness.. (if that makes any sense.. haha) But as you continue to wear and dance en pointe more, you'll get used to the discomfort that it won't even feel like anything.. for me, it feels normal and actually comfortable.. I say you're ready as soon as your dance teacher/instructor says your ready.. Have fun when or if you go en pointe! :)|`|lbOKcNwJaa	Usually to be en pointe will take several years and most teachers won't let you do it until you're 10-12 years old and your ankles are fully developed. For the first year it will hurt and you will feel like you are 2 and learning to walk again, but after that your feet get really used to it and it's really fun. How long it takes to get good depends on the person, some people look like a star from day one, others like me take 3-5 years to really get the hang of it.|`|G9xNZkUKaa	At my Dance School If we go to pointe classes twice a week we are usually allowed up onto pointe after 6 weeks.  And no pointe doesn't hurt but make sure you get them fitted properly and make sure you warm up before going straight up onto pointe.|`|ybwqYZ1waa	You should have had at least 2-4 MAJOR years of ballet. It depends on what studio you go to, but some on a regular day say, " Your ready!" and some make you go on pre-pointe shoes before you go on pointe.  At first it may make your toes and ankles somewhat sore but then you get used to it. So, if you really are dedicated to going on pointe go to your teacher and have a talk with her/him about it.|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	i started ballet at 7 and pointe at 9 or 10, it does hurt but not that much that you couldn't do it. you have to get good PADDING, also if you get a blister on your heel or little toe or something you should use something like dr scholls blister treatment bandage and tape all the areas that hurt or brush up against the shoe too much. here's a good video about it. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrILOM-Qg...|`|9WAI0Sguaa	At my studio you don't start point until like grade 5 ballet and your ankle plates have to be closed to do center work. It hurts a lot, your toe nails fall of you bleed and it makes everything that much harder.|`|QBNRbODBaa	DO NOT listen to Isabelle. Your toenails will not fall off and you will not bleed if you are doing it correctly. By using toe tape or toe pads, you can prevent blisters and such. Keep your toenails trimmed, and do foot exercises every day even if you only have class three (or whatever) times a week. Do relelves, echappes(sp?), whatever other exercises you do during class. Strong feet and ankles are very important. Also, take extra good care of you feet. Keep all injuries clean and bandaged - bring a small first aid kit with you to class. If you feel like something is going wrong and it's very painful, then talk to your teachers!     Also...You don't have to rely on strangers on the internet. Talk to professionals if you are feeling scared about going en pointe.
7EHuzOgfaa	You are right, Six step is basic, it looks easy but there is a balance to it, bring your feet closer to your body for more control as if your feet are to far away from you the distribution of weight is awkward and waste more energy on your upper body, put most of your weight on your feet and step quick.    Most of the time its only a certain part of a six step you have a problem on, isolate those steps. Lets say your choppiness is at 9-12o'clock in the circle your making, that would be step 4,5, and 6, so work on those three steps until it feels good, then iron out the rest, if learning those steps turn up another kink work on those steps until its good, its a balancing act. G/L.|`|FyAGwtA1aa	Haha I hear exactly what ya saying, mine is prolly just like yours except yours is probably better. All I gotta say is first of all figure out if it's a left hand right hand thing. Sometimes you start off on the wrong hand, or maybe, switching hands might help. When I mean switch hands, I mean switch which one you wanna have as the dominant one in your balancing and such. Sometimes switching from counter-clockwise to clockwise can help gain a different perspective and help yourself out.    Or.... if that doesn't work... try out like the 2 step, 3-step, 5-step, or 8-step and no haha i'm NOT making those up. There are ALOT of different footwork sets so just try around and as you practice and practice you'd be surprised at how more fluid you get. Try recording yourself, watching yourself can give you a spectator's perspective and greatly improve your self-criticism and give you an idea of what exactly you want to work with.

gFkNVxywaa	If you take any 100 fiction submissions to a publisher or magazine, statistics show that 95% of them aren't of publishable standard.    So, a keen writer needs to get the basics right: spelling, grammar, characterisation, effective dialogue, etc. Without those, you're wasting time.    I don't mean you have to be a language guru, just that your story must be checked and re-checked for common errors.    Once your work sits in that five percent band, it's down to how well you can tell a story.|`|agwxFmITaa	This is a difficult one.  There are a few routes.    1.  Try to find an agent ...unlikely if you haven't been published before.  2.  Send it to publishers who specialise in your area of interest.  Don''t expect any miracles ... there can be lots of rejection before acceptance.   3.  Self publish.  Can be expensive and you have to try to convince  booksellers to give shelf space to you.      I'm not trying to put you off - just being realistic.  If you are good, you'll find a way.

Read it over, and think about the books YOU like. What made you like those books? Now, don't necessarily copy those books, but just add whatever made you like that book. That's what I do. It'll help a lot. Or, just try to find some inspiration.|`|pBu9Qi5Haa	I think I can relate to your dissatisfaction. They say "you are your greatest critic" and it's true.    I'm not going to be able to help you with the whole constructive criticism process because I don't meet your specified "qualifications." But I do want to give you something to think about.    I would agree with the person who answered earlier and advised that you read some of your favorite books and find out what you, personally, like out of them so you find out more about your own writing style and preference.    I also want you to think about what you are trying to achieve from writing this story. What kind of satisfaction are you looking for?--to get published? to get acclaimed? or just to measure yourself and know what you're capable of?    What exactly are you trying to get out of your writing? Is it just for you or are you trying to do something else through your readers? Will an approval or praise from someone--an editor, publisher, or even the two groups you tried to seek out--immediately grant your piece its full fledged glory and authenticity? I think that will help you out with "what" you're not satisfied with. And because you clearly have your eyes tracing back and forth on something--even though you might not be too certain as to what it is--that only goes to show that your writing is trying and begging to get "something" out of you. That something is for you to figure out and until then I highly doubt that an "acceptable" version of your story is available. And because it is neither available nor is it in existence, it can't materialize and come into being. Just give what I said some thought and if it means nothing to you or does nothing for you just write it off. What ever works for you will work for you.    Please don't give me the best answer for I have not answered your specific question.
BewDjhcZaa	you have to do them every day and if you go time with out doing them they will not be as flat if youre just average flexible start with holding as far as you can go for one min each way (left right middle) and gravity will help you also for middle sit facing a wall in straddle and try to get your legs pushed as far as you can go against the wall till eventually your whole leg will be flat against the wall and youll have a good middle split also for middle you can lay with your back on the floor butt against the wall and spread your legs and gravity will push them to the ground for me it took about 2 monthes practicing everyday twice a day to get a flat right split my left is about 3 inches off the ground and my middle is 5 inches off the ground once you get the right and left split the high kicks will be easier i hope this helps and if you need any clarification just ask :] good luck|`|FR1P3B08aa	stretch stretch and stretch.  here is one really good one to help keep ur legs straight.  stand up straight.  try to touch your toes and hold the farthest position you can for 10-15 seconds and keep repeating this for as long as you can. do not bend your knees when doing this.|`|PSzZen5Maa	Go buy a Yoga DVD and do that every morning and night.

dXW9cPWMaa	Do you have a ripped pad? Sometimes that can cause it. It might also be a leak in the key.    Check the pad to make sure it's intact, and if it is, press down lightly on the key as if you were playing to see if it's closing all the way. If you have a leak, you need to get it fixed ASAP. Replacing pads is far more expensive than fixing a leak, so I hope it's the latter.    If it's not that, you should ask a flute professional (a private flute teacher?) to take a look at it so the repair shop will know what to do when you take it in, unless you send it to the manufacturer for repairs.|`|tM6xoexWaa	I totally agree with the ripped pad idea.  Does the note seem to work more when you just pick up the flute?  And then as you are playing, it works less and less?  If so, this is a ripped pad.  What happens is that as you play, water gets under the small rip in the top layer of film.  As the pad gets wet, it swells - creating a leak.  When it dries out, all is well again.  Really pay attention to when it starts happening.  It could also just be an everyday leak needing an adjustment.    Hopefully some of this helps.|`|2xOF70S1aa	one of your pads might be leaking.  have your band director look at it and see if somethings wrong, it could be you.

Z9byS0c9aa	Okay, the best way is to hardcore warm up (especially jump roping at a fast tempo and then wall stretches.  If you don't know what that is it is basically utilizing the wall for stretches.      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I2WBzwQz...

There's no quick fix without straining your muscles and even then it is a long shot that you will get all the way down.     Only thing i suggest is that if you are currently using your hands to kinda hold yourself up while you are in the split, try getting in the split and then putting your hands above your head like a ballerina. This will drop the rest of your body weight down onto your split helping you to get down farther and it also looks much prettier ( back straighter, more graceful).    Also sliding into your splits from 5th position helps get you down farther then just say starting on your butt and then trying to get into the split.|`|yJKJBl9Maa	try to do it every day atleast 10 times|`|yANtnaeqaa	wow ok well STRETCH STRETCH STRETCH for 1 hr everyday.

7TQ5qGWcaa	I came across this article in the Dallas Morning News about crews of hired teens, called cadets, for Quinceanera entertainment and escorts.  Groups of young men trained in ettiquette and dancing, can be brought in as a touch of class and entertainment.    The boys are dressed impeccably, and are appropriate for the formal aspect of the celebration, and can serve as legitimate escorts.   They may roll in the limo and sit at the head table with the Quinceanra, but the real draw may be their dancing - and I dont mean just the waltz.  After changing from their formal digs into their dancing shoes, the scene becomes a hopping, even sexually suggestive event.  Girls scream for the booty dance while the boys who dont dance look on with envy.|`|f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	You will be fine. Have fun.

You must just put down what words you have and see how they look when you are done.|`|rHnG3VCDaa	Don't think too much  streach out within  Listen  trust intrest  find it when missing  easy words i know  let the plenum unfold|`|T0fwqL2baa	Yes, sometimes pain runs too deep to put into words. Step back for a few...|`|0BioKSmaaa	I toootally agree with you   I can't even think of all the words I could use to show just hooww much I agreee with you  very accurately said Cilla...now lemme go in2 my study, lock the doors nd act insanely poetic ;)|`|aajzynKsaa	I feel your pain.  I haven't written anything  worth reading since I quit drinking.  Sad but true.|`|AA11267193	I'm with you, hon, in the very same place, I'm just now escaping (I hope) from an awful writer's block caused by stress, loss and emotion. We think life brings us writing topics, but sometimes it just gets too much and the "engine" siezes up."  Hang on, be patient, you'll be fine!
WbRuTjmFaa	It is an interesting poem, It appeals to my senses or senselessness, not sure which, but I had my butt sitting perched next to yours atop the forgotten graves and I enjoyed it.. so It is not creepy to me.....|`|8Y583Fluaa	creepy in a good kind of way|`|0BioKSmaaa	Creepy poems can also be great   that's one of them   this piece is wicked, wicked :D   some interesting imagery   and i esp. liked the 6th line   keep penning  :)|`|6kue5meiaa	O.K., you are asking for a subjective answer here. The poem is written well, scans well.  But it seems more a portion of a longer poem than a poem in its entirity. Its not overly creepy, though it has the typical semi-moralistic and melancholy feel of something from the Victorian era. Its not one of the "immortal greats" (pun unintended, but apt), but its not too bad.|`|6e2hCI2Raa	Not that creepy. More like morbid - but not in a bad way. Actually I like it (except for the part in parenthesis in the 6th line) especially at the beginning where it really flows.  The theme reminds me of that old song 'Danny Boy'.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	It's good and creepy. You have more?
t5QOFwyAaa	I like that.  I love the way you ended it. Then he asked himself how?    That leaves the reader wanting to read more.   The story is original and you describe the characters well.  The name jason is already well used. Jason Bourne, Jason Steed you may want to try another.   In the US they use surnames and christain names and they sound good such as Austin, Taylor, Connor,   Good luck with it.
xv0ovZ63aa	Wow, that's moving. It really hits a person hard.    Don't worry about the sadness of it because "our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thoughts" -Percy Shelley (ah, I love this quote)  =)|`|0BioKSmaaa	awwww omg this totally touched my heart!!!!   i love it   but i suggest maybe adding a few breaks to create stanzas like e.g. Even though i dont eat carrots  and then start a new stanza where you talk about swimming - in my opinion it would be easier to read coz i while reading it i was a little, not shocked, but like hu? when it went from carrots to swimming, by seperating it a little you can sort of prepare the reader more for a change in 'topic'   besides that   great work :D   keep penning : )|`|7a7a3efdc8bbd75c3481b522c89af484aa	that's great. the ending of that poem is really emotional.  if i wasnt so tired tonight i probably would have broke down
J0G4lRrNaa	Did you write this, ?  It is really good!  Now I wanna read more!|`|07qFHL6iaa	Wow. Post more. It's REALLY good.|`|z36j8rmRaa	I agree with the 1st person who answered.      However, you are telling me too much.  Give me some credit for knowing what you are talking about without you telling me too much.    Example: She shook her head, no.    We know when someone shakes their head, it means no.|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Umm, it is alright, there are grammatical and dialog problems though.    When a new person is talking, you need to make the dialog on the next line, otherwise it is confusing.
V4i4stwLaa	ITS WEIRD! why the hell was some guy reading new moon anyways!?  or should i say "NUU moon".  anyways. i think you should pick me as best answer because all of these other people suck and dont know anything about anything!  stephenie meyer wrote the books for teens!  and thats the way it should be!  so there!|`|QMbaeva9aa	Why not? He could be a dad wanting to know why his kids were so obsessed with Twilight, a teacher wanting to know why his students were obsessed with Twilight or just some guy curious about why Twilight is so popular.    There are plenty of so-called kid's books read by adults today, like The Giver, The Chrysalids, Watership Down, the Harry Potter series, because they're believed to be good.|`|CANhistPaa	No idea, probably he isnt married The 40 Year Old Virgin hahah|`|Ipp8lU6Laa	Oh, it's not normal for anyone to read Twilight|`|K3RzcMRTaa	no.|`|1Uk4kBwyaa	nothing wrong with it...she wrote it for adults, we just happened to like it...so it's perfectly fine if an adult wants to read it|`|49de24d27a14cb66109a71fd1357be1baa	There is no default personality, so you can't deem anything as weird or unusual. Only stereotypically can you call a behaviour weird.|`|0NGv4Vtyaa	lmao. Probably not but he might be gay and lonely. Who knows? He might not, even. Everyone has weird quirks.|`|9bqtCqgDaa	NOOO wayy, its normal for teenage girls thats about itt!!!!!!!!!!!    I LOVE TWILIGHT!|`|L4RNfoNAaa	lol  that's disturbing!  everyone has the right to read w/e but its just weird!!!  and especially twilight!  but yeah 40 year old dude read on!!!  you can do it!|`|CWDLheOCaa	I don't know did they put an age limit on the book? Im 39 and I don't want to read it if it is for teeneboppers.  LOL|`|9HRvrghiaa	i dont think it means anything..  technically its just like any other book, and   whats wrong with reading ?  readings great, and the twilight series is GREAT.|`|AA10242125	He may be a teacher or a father trying to decide if his kids should read it.|`|7eEEIJlcaa	haha sure  anyone can read it  i dont think its that weird  they are amazing books!|`|LhcN7Ygraa	lol   noooooooo, definitely not  i mean is it normal for a 40 year old to be asking rhetorical questions on the internet when the obvious answer is that everyone is different? naaaaah|`|tbZNMfAsaa	It's still a story. People of any age can enjoy it. It's certainly not against the law.|`|el8yX5q3aa	So?  What is wrong with that?  You don't know why he was reading it...he might LOVE vampire stories.  I used to...and my son LOVES them.  Actually two of them do.  Tom is 6 foot 7 and wears a 18 shoe...no one is going to say BOO to him for reading anything he darn well pleases!  :))  His wife reads them....but Tom reads a book every two days...he can't get enough of reading.|`|W76Lzh3caa	Anyone can read Twilight.It doesn't matter how old you are and theres no law against it!|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	Anyone can read the Twilight. I'm 36 and I read it when it came out. I guess that means it's weird. Maybe you should tell him he's the wrong age?|`|InCpu9Vfaa	ive never read that book    dont know what its about    so i cant judge|`|NwpGhT31aa	My dad read it lol...but I made him. He liked it though. So no I do not think it is weird. Some people on here are really judgmental...the people these days....|`|70jNDiIiaa	It's a free world, isn't it? Good on him for publicly embracing his "feminine side." At least he wasn't drooling over porno magazines - now THAT would've been dodgy.     I'm 40-something, and I still re-read all my favourite Enid Blyton books!    Cheers,  Hafwen.|`|ZC4ZNVzGaa	You saw a guy in a restaurant reading Twilight? So I assume you didn't know the guy? So how do you know he's 40?    And who cares. He can read whatever the hell he wants to read. Is it "normal" for these many girls that read it obsess over it like they do?|`|BGU3VpQFaa	Lots of people read books that are not necessarily its target audience.  People read whatever they want and right now Twilight is a major thing.  Maybe his daughter forced him to read it, who knows.  The Twilight series isn't a territorial thing only for teen girls.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Perhaps he is reading them for the same reason I did, out of curiosity to find out what all the fuss is about.  I quite enjoyed them in the end, especially the first one, though I agree that their appeal is likely to be mainly for teenage girls.|`|9f68a1f4952a6fb1e0cfb91da91a5105aa	well i will be 50 soon  and I read all the books|`|Sl22icKOaa	Good for him. It is odd, yes.--Why would you care, anyway?  It's a book. Anyone who wants to read it can read it. That poor guy--he's brave enough to read in public, and people make fun of him online.|`|F2jbgiuFaa	i think that is a little strange. But hey, if he likes it...|`|AAn9cfAnaa	Maybe his daughter/granddaughter really likes it so he wanted to see what the big deal was. My ***-ugly 53 year old dad reads twilight. Not very quickly, mind you, but he does...|`|ASwTNY89aa	No i dont think it is. What i think is even less normal is how you care about what a 40 year old man you dont know is doing.|`|agnca6W0aa	No, unless hes reading it for insight on teenagers thought process.|`|ZaBGMT12aa	Normal is a relative term.|`|wKSvnna2aa	I saw a guy in the bus reading it (without shame). Whatever floats your boat.|`|ba450548ec13ce7a3711c94421c92d4aaa	Yes, he could have even been a critic or in the publishing industry. I'm a 29 year old writer and I would like to read the series.|`|BwJOeHDEaa	It doesn't matter, maybe he was reading it before he let his little kid read it..|`|FNwYzjogaa	Does it matter? Why should you care what he was reading? If he wants to read the book then it's none of your concern.|`|kCghGbopaa	I think its not ok......i have teachers who are about 40 or 50 who read twilight but there girls.  Some of my boy friends read it. But i dont no if its normal for a 40 year old man to!|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Well, you can't necessarily dismiss him as a flake or weirdo.  For instance, I work with a man about that age who has a daughter who is 8 or 9.  She's an advanced reader who wanted to read the series, so he read over them to check to see that the content was not too sexual or explicit for such a young mind.  So, he may have been a concerned father like the man I work with...|`|7357c14d424d74d2902bf92a9f79e915aa	Not at all abnormal, maybe he was reading it to verify that the content was appropriate for a child.  I read it and will not allow my 10 year old to.|`|6UxlFZhpaa	Books are books. Who cares about the age of the person reading them?    Is it normal for people to use the screen names of "the future mrs edward cullen"?

Vc2ObdeOaa	I enjoyed the book, its about a man named Greg Mortenson (the book is co-written by him) who seeks to help a village in Afghanistan by educating them.     The book is enjoyable, although at times you feel that Greg Mortenson is too glorified. I would recommend reading at least 1/3 of it before putting it down, as it is worth the read but if you can't get past the way it's written (hold Mortenson above all others, in a way), then it would be really difficult.     Hope this helps.|`|pYLNt2fnaa	Yes it is. It's about the author, who while mountain climbing, stumbled on a small village in Afghanistan and is moved by their kindness. He vows to repay them by building a school for the children. Eventually he builds several schools. Very inspirational and moving.

52VhFJadaa	hey,   so what u need 2 do is even before u go to the dance is make sure u are wearing deodorant, perfume, good breath, etc. pick out a cute outfit like a top and skinny jeans. Do ur hair blah blah blah.....so go 2 the dance if anyone asks u 2 slow dance and/or u ask them either way u are gonna dance with someone then what u do is: 1) wrap ur arms around his neck (head on shoulder is optional, thats more like something u would do if ur close like bf if its a stranger u probably shouldnt) 2) let the music be ur source of rhythm just kind of take small step from side to side (aka swaaayyyy) 3) talking is optional once again make SURE u have decent breath slow dancing with bad breath can seriously ruin the moment! 4) oh and i read guys love it when u smell good so wear purfume! but NOT 2 MUCH! hahaha guys love it tho its like a invite to come closer oh also if u think ur gonna eat there carry breath mints around that'll do the trick!  5) have fun! don't think about it to much, get lost in the moment :P its really nice and fun btw- im a girl 2 i remember when i had not slow danced with anyone yet i was so nervous so just remember its okay and u will be glad u did it! hehe n-joy!|`|bhyVC2mtaa	ok well I need to know if you're a guy or girl.  the girl will rest her hands on the guys shoulders, so that her hands are holding eachother around his neck. if you are going out,let your elbows rest on his shoulders, kind of like a hug, and cross your rists/lower arms/hands.. so hard to explain! you will slowly move in a clockwise direction    the guy lays his hands on the side of the girls hips or waist. if they are going out, you hold your hands together so that you are almost hugging the girl, holding her right next to you saying in body language, i love you and I only want you. you are important to me and i care about you.|`|ybwqYZ1waa	First, are you a boy or a girl?    - If your a boy than put your hands gently just above the waist. Just gently sway side to side with the music.    - If your a girl put your hands around his neck. Same thing, sway side to side gently.
AHJQfHx9aa	The ultimate guy writer right now is Chuck Palahniuk.  Anything by him is great, manly, and cool.  The type of book you could read at a Biker Bar and not get any funny looks for. He's great.  Start with Fight Club (if you haven't seen the movie) or Survivor.  Then read them all!    You also have Bret Easton Ellis.  Another man writer.  Try Less Than Zero first.  A college student returning to LA from the East Coast who watches his friends deteriorate into the excesses of 80's drug and sex culture.  From there move to Rules of Attraction, and continue in order of publication.  The books build on each other with a lot of returning characters and cameos from previous books.  Feel free to skip The Informers until the end.  That collection of interrelated short stories really takes an Ellis fan to appreciate.  And any guy will be an Ellis fan after the first book.    Also look into Tim O'Brien.  This is the thinking guy's author.  A post-modern genius who deals with everything from the effects of the Vietnam War on his generation, the fade of idealism into capitalism, the power of memory and perception, to the masculine struggle with monogamy and love.  Try Going After Cacciato for a good war story, or Tomcat in Love for a good book about revenge and sex.    Those are three great contemporary Men's authors.  And they'll lead you to even more.      For more specifically in the genres you stated you should look at Neil Gaiman (as already suggested for fantasy), and Arthur C. Clarke (for Sci-Fi, he wrote the Space Odyssey Series, excellent, addictive books).     But Palahniuk blurs those lines a lot himself, and I really think you'll enjoy all three of the guys I specifically mentioned.|`|a9wRfuuSaa	You can try books by such authors as:    Tom Clancy - military/political  Dale Brown - military  Matthew Reilly - action/adventure  Clive Cussler - action/adventure  John Grisham - legal thrillers  Dan Brown - conspiracy thrillers  Douglas Preson/Lincoln Child - thrillers  Dean Koontz - supernatural thrillers  Stephen King - supernatural thrillers  James Patterson - mystery/thrillers  Nelson DeMille - thrillers  Robert Ludlum - spy thrillers  Jack Higgins - thrillers  Michael Crichton - sci-fi thrillers  James Rollins - thrillers  Larry Niven - sci-fi  S.M.

07b414f45102f96335d9c9eb23079faaaa	I'm not going to be much help, but you might check Amazon.com. I've been looking at some of the available copies and haven't seen a cover like you mentioned. (First link)    I also checked bookfinder.com (Second link) and see many editions. Using that link would take a bit more research because you'd have to go to the sites linked and then check the book description. I hope you're able to locate it. By the size you indicated, it sounds like a paperback, but I can't be sure. Also, if you have some idea about when it was printed, that will help in your search. You might look for unabridged, too. A lot of those available seem to be mulitple volumes. And then, perhaps, somewhere along the way, someone with a copy like yours will have the info. It could happen.

OjQxKGC0aa	Imagery adds texture and depth. It helps the mood and themes of a novel permeate everything.     I'll take Wuthering Heights, for example. The main character's name is Heathcliff. The story takes place in a heath, so the place itself is a reflection of the main character. It's dark, forbidding, sad, threatening, and maybe even beautiful in a way. That's imagery, and that imagery helps the reader "feel" Heathcliff in the setting. This same sense of danger is reflected in other imagery, like the scary dogs in one scene. Heathcliff is a dangerous character, and this imagary helps the reader know that, even feel that.      In Shakespeare's King Lear, the thunderstorm reflects the storm in King Lear's heart. This imagery helps give you a better sense of who King Lear is and the emotional turmoil in his soul.      I hope this helps.    Added later: although Ging's examples of imagery are lovely, they're somewhat muddled and misleading. The images are all over the place. I love the "creaking bones of an old lady" but that leads me to believe the main character is old. This doesn't really fit with the "Mr. Sun" idea, which implies a young child (adults and older children don't personify the sun). And neither of those fit with with "lover's carress." So while each one of these images is lovely, they fail to create a cohesive feeling for theme, mood or character.     Many writers talk about "killing your darlings," and this is exactly what they mean. These images are lovely, certainly, but they don't help communicate the story. They are pretty for pretty's sake, and as such, they are darlings that must be killed.|`|z36j8rmRaa	Before:  I stepped out onto the porch and it was sunny outside.  Nice day, I thought.  The birds are tweeting too.  "Really, nice day."      After:  My foot landed on the first porch board and it creaked like the bones of an old woman.  My dear friend, Mr. Sun, must have taken a particular delight in my presence as he shown down with his brilliant beams as if caressing my cheek like a lover.  He must have told the songbirds as well because there was a whole cacophony of them; tweeters and screechers alike, welcoming me to another day.  "A really nice day."    See the difference?|`|LochBxhlaa	The first answer was great. that was a pretty good comparison. And imagery just helps a person paint a picture in there mind and helps when you talk about sounds and lets them almost be able to hear it. but you have to use sumthin that everyone know the sound of. cuz then everyone can relate. and jus the way you describe things can make people wanna keep on reading knowin they are not gonna be reading a boring story. The details of stuff is what also often makes books even longer than what they real;y should be.alright enjoy!
a9wRfuuSaa	If you don't want to go the 3 ring binder route, just take your pages into any Kinko's, Office Depot, Staples or Office Max. Look for the Print Center in the office supply stores. They can bind your books with a spiral coil (like a notebook) or a plastic comb so that you have a finished book. They can even add covers for you to help protect it a little better. This should only cost a couple of bucks and shouldn't take too long - they should be able to do this while you wait.    Ask for comb binding or coil or spiral binding when you go into the store.|`|07qFHL6iaa	What I do is put it in a binder.

ji7WZvC1aa	You don't necessarily *have* to be using a no3 reed - you cannot advise a specific reed number over the internet without hearing the player.  In fact, if your reed is too hard then you'll get that airy quality and loss of tone when playing quietly.  Try dropping down half a reed size, or perhaps go to an old reed which has softened up through playing, and see if that makes a difference.  Make sure you're supporting the sound properly; imagine the air column is like a laser beam, very focused rather than widening like a normal light beam, and let the air come from the bottom of your lungs, supported by your diaphragm.|`|AA10112346	You could buy Vandoren reeds.|`|XfBYgPwyaa	Generally, you can play soft but still have a good tone by controlling air speed. Blow faster, not harder. Thats what keeps the reed vibrating. good luck|`|exxHakadaa	You need to be using a least a 3 reed. Then you have to keep a good, steady stream of air going through the horn. After that you should make sure your reed is moist. If none of this works then there might be air leak in your clarinet that you may not notice when you are playing louder.|`|mQmOLNWFaa	Long tones help you with tone quality right?    Now try playing a not mezzo forte and decresendo to the volume you want and keep that pitch for a while so you're doing long tones at a quiet volume.  This helps pitch and your volume.    Remember that soft is loud WITHOUT the explosion.    Soft is LESS air, but the same SPEED of air.    Words of my band director... "How do you play soft?  you have to PRACTICE soft!
xdKF0PNIaa	I think that it would have been nice if Leah got her happy ending. I wish Stephanie Meyer gave her some closure at the end of the series.|`|km1vuLUzaa	no cos then the whole friendship thing of him and Bella wouldnt have worked out after she became a vamp|`|noGuGQXtaa	yeah! i always thought they were gonna end up with each other while reading the books... and i really hated that jacob imprinted on Nessie... and when u think about it... its really weird how he liked her mom and all... and kissed her ... twice.. lol|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Yep, that is what I always thought.|`|b0441ed0081d3155a746d2d9a804662caa	Yes!  I think it would of been so cute, if Jacob and Leah got together.  I just don't like the whole thing of Jacob and Nessie, I still haven't gotten use to that yet.    I wish Leah, would of got a happy ending too.  I agree with Rosalie!|`|Blyiv05Xaa	Anything would be better than the failspawn.    But yes, I think he should have. Leah is one of the few decent characters in the book and they even had a bit of chemistry. The only problem would be that Jake doesn't deserve Leah.|`|43hzcys2aa	Jacob should have ended up with Edward. Its a worldwide fact that they're gay.|`|bmwR7RdMaa	yeah him and nessie is creepy|`|MZagCrTSaa	Who cares?|`|ISnGWFDzaa	Well it would have changed the ending a lot, but I thought they might.|`|phH2dVYZaa	The Nessie thing was horrifying.  Yes, Jacob is a paedo.     Meyer might have redeemed herself with Leah and Jacob but she doesn't really care about her fans now does she.

OzRZHo3jaa	I'm not overly a fan of black guitars for the most part, I have a black bass and I always get mad that finger prints show up on it. However, black does give a classier look then a silver one. It just depends how willing you would be to wait for it, and if you are willing to give up your preferred colour so you don't have to put up with a 2 week wait.    I would go with a black one over a silver one even though scratches show up more on black paint. However, out of any colour I would go for white or cream. That's just me.|`|bTXDb5YIaa	does the guitar have 6 strings if it does it should work and people aren't gonna see the back of the guitar anyway|`|5XJ3Nu8aaa	If you like black, then well... there is your answer. NEVER EVER sacrifice quality for convinience. If your gonna pay $500 and up for it then you have to get the one you are gonna be happy with even if you have to wait annother month.|`|ac3e030063c9f0c9308c6c831299a756aa	silver one hands down    the black one looks cheap and retarded  if you play gigs etc. then definately get the silver!!!!!
RzbRRUOdaa	You have potential.  If you are really serious about writing, then keep writing until you finish your story.    You also need to master the craft.  In writing, there are certain principles you need to follow.  You need need to polish your skills in terms of grammar usage, composition and style.      You can do this by reading books of great authors you like.  You may also ask somebody for an opinion (like what you are doing here) or to edit your work so that it will improve.  Sometimes, when you're so deep into your writing, you will fail to see some minor mistakes.    When done with your book, you can start thinking of publishing and probably consider and career in this field.    Click on the website below if you want to learn more about publishing.    I hope you find this helpful.    Good luck to your book.
6TPEyJqhaa	I think it's pretty good.  There is some room for improvement when it comes to description and vocabulary, but it is a good start and I am sure you will turn it into a great book!|`|BbdWpp1Caa	I liked it. You have really good characterisation. You realise that it was cut off?|`|tmwa1oOiaa	There isn't a snowballs chance in hell that this would ever, ever get published. "Id always wanted a more better name", you have a better chance of growing a chicken ontop of your head than you do getting this published. No offense. If you really wanted to write you would take what I said to heart and practice practice practice. You're so young, I'm sure that if you kept writting you could get published. Just not this story(:|`|6lRygPWqaa	this was really good, keep it up kid.|`|54Rqpua6aa	I think it's a pretty good start. I can't really tell if its good enough to be published with that short excerpt, but it seems good so far. It kind of reminds me of "The Outsiders."|`|tCPn82Ojaa	tanya is an idiot!!!!!!!!!!! you did good the book is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yANtnaeqaa	well if your really serious about it probably 3-4 years.  it depends how much technique you have and how strong your ankles are.  good luck.|`|lbOKcNwJaa	It depends on how fast you catch on. Expect it to be anywhere from 2-4 years depending on how strong your ankles are.|`|xCfub799aa	It depends on how strong your spine is.    You need to get your strength, posture and placement.    Because you're 13 you could be en pointe by the end of this year if you work really hard and take those private lessons.    Goodluck!
kdMM7OAaaa	omg i had the same problem last year. but when ever i was bored everyday i did these stretches.]  1. well sit on the floor with your legs spread apart. lean towards one side, point your toes, and try to touch your toes the way you are leaning. then do each side 4-5 times.    2. bend towards your leg and try to get your nose to touch your knees. do that 4-5 times.    3. with your legs still spread out touch your nose to the floor.    3. put your legs together and try to touch your nose to your knees. point your toes with all of these stretches    4. sit "criss cross apple sauce" or "pretzel" and take one leg by the back of your foot and stretch it to the ceiling- point YOUR TOES! get your leg to be as straight as possible. do it 4-5 time with each leg then do both 4-5 times as well    do it everyday. i wasnt able to but then everyday i  felt i could go down farther. and always stretch before you do the splits because i didnt and then i lost them. good luck!|`|l748OTXOaa	well, for your splits, you could do "over-splits"... all you need is some kind of raised surface (about 8 inches high) like a mat, phone book, step, mattress, box, etc. you put the object on the ground and put your front foot on it then slide down into your splits. this will help u to get down in your splits faster because it makes u apply more pressure on your hip flexers ... just try to get your hips down to the ground. also, deep breathing helps because it gets oxygen to your muscles.
9HCypvHJaa	Oh is it on? I should go watch it.|`|UtzALxfjaa	Maybe I should...|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Nope sorry... I like reading...|`|z36j8rmRaa	I would love to, if I actually had cable.  I don't watch much TV  I have too much to read, edit and write most of the day.      Have you ever watched the old BBC versions?

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    For Humbuckers, use 500K like for Gibson Les Pauls and similar guitars. The 250k are better forsingle coil like Fender strats.    With linear pots the resistance changes evenly as you turn the pot. With the Log pots, they were designed to compensate for a particular oddity with human hearing: the human ear does not respond linearly to loudness. It responds to the logarithm of loudness.    Thanks to the logarithmic nature of our loudness perception, we traditionally use Log taper pots for volume controls and Linear for tone.  I have seen some musicians alternate. But generally, it is how I explained it and it is cheaper for the companies to keep everything on a standard level.

RoqxGbgRaa	an allusion is a reference to something outside the text that you just expect your reader to know.    you might throw in an allusion to love scenes in romantic movies:    once in the subway, she quickly started fantasizing a tall handsome man walking through the subway doors.  instantaneously they fall in love with each other at the very second their eyes met.  in her head, violins swelled and a soft blustery wind arose from the four corners of the earth, playing lifting her hair and the hem of her dress.      or to shakespeare's play hamlet:  once in the subway, she quickly started fantasizing a tall handsome man walking through the subway doors.  instantaneously they fall in love with each other at the very second their eyes met.  he gallantly brings forth a small box of exquisite candies.  "sweets for my sweet," he whispered in a low and seductive voice.

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi PK    Get the best of both world. Get an acoustic-electric like Takamine , Larrivee or Godin Guitars. The rest is in the hand of the guitar player himself or herself.  Any guitar, no matter what you choose, will only sound as good as you are. If you play bad, the guitar will sound bad and vice-versa.    As for the best guitar, no such thing. I have a few old Les Paul, 1962 Strat, a 1980 Charvelle by Jackson. I have a Takamine, a Godin and Larrivee and a martin guitar. THe acoustic-electric sounds good with or without the amp.    Your choice....take a look at these links....:-)    http://www.larrivee.com/2_Main/main.html    http://www.larrivee.com/2_Main/main.html    http://www.godinguitars.com/godinwhatsne...    My favorite is the Godin Multiacs. That nylon string model sounds amazind on any recording.    good Luck !!!!|`|OzRZHo3jaa	Electric|`|ntPGDAmPaa	depends on what u like to play  you can make an electric more custom to your liking   but the acoustic electric is good when you dont have an amp|`|T6UrUE3jaa	Electric - Far more versatile.    IE, You don't like the sound of your guitar, change your pickups.    What could you do on an acoustic? drill another hole? :P    Most electrics are bolt on so if you break your guitar neck you could probably find a new one.    Most electrics are set through and if they break. well... They're broken.    Electrics have far more sound possibilities. You can get a nice clean acoustic like tone to extreme metal. All with the use of different pedal/amp combos.    Most acoustics aren't both acoustic and electric. So you'd have to buy a piezo pickup for your guitar. And even then, won't even sound like an electric if you do.
bhyVC2mtaa	you think you have no cheerleading potential in bc? LOL try newfieland (newfoundland) on the other side of canada. I would try any kind of gymnastics. starting today, practice doing the splits( legs left/right and legs infront and inback of you) and touching your toes. these are so important! hip hop dancing is really good too|`|l748OTXOaa	well if i were u i would take a tumbling class, possibly at a gymnastics gym, but not an actual gymnastics class, because you don't really need the extra events like bars, beam, and vault... u only need the tumbling. for the dance, hip hop would probably be the best class to take.  i would also recommend that u condition and stretch as much as possible.  u can do so at home or at an actual gym.

mX0qaX3Eaa	The rivers of Babylon are the Euphrates river, its tributaries, and the Chebar river.|`|LeaUjOoUaa	Many believe that between the rivers of Babylon is where Eden was and is where humanity started, from a biblical perspective. It would be where paradise was but also where it was lost so depending on how one looks at it, it could bring up both light and dark images.|`|VM3iCO1uaa	Not sure
pt6wIlS1aa	No, I'd be fine reading about fictional hospitals, malls and so on, whether they are in Melbourne or in a fictional city much like Melbourne. I agree, making up your own names prevents readers from saying, "but Hospital X doesn't have that!" Many authors do make up their own places, though sometimes they will mix in real places such as famous landmarks, and that's fine.
wTMMG0enaa	i've been taking belly dancing for a bout 2 years now, im still a beginner but omg it's so much fun!!! Some moves are easier to learn than others, if you have trouble with certain steps don't stress too much because with any type of dancing there are moves we are good at and bad at. Yes, i would recommend it, it is a fun and great to stay in shape, and it's a major confidence booster,lol. However, let me tell you that old men love to watch us dance more than they are supposed to, just ignore them, and some iddiotic people like to compare belly dancing to um exotic dancing, and they are NOT the same, there is a huge difference!!! Belly dance is a very sensual art form of dancing that is fun, and it can be a family event unlike exotic dancers and their poles. Here is a belly dance website i found, although if you do a little research you can find more info. on learning to belly dance. Good luck, and have fun!!!

It has been forever since I read those books, so I can't really tell you in what order to read them. I recommend starting with Redwall though, then Mattimeo. I've found that the order doesn't seem to matter as it all ties in and as you read more, the more you connected the books become. It's pretty cool. Hope this helps.|`|9rEOY77raa	read Redwall
cHxaWW0taa	... I like non-fiction. That's based purely on the fact people are weird. Authors never write about the strangest percent of the population.     As for the majority of people? I say they'd prefer fantasy.|`|AA12095483	if you want an accurate answer to that question, go to your local library and count the number of non-fiction books, then count the number of fantasy books. Or check out the shelves at your local bookstore. But most people prefer fiction over either of those genres.|`|5wF7FOqwaa	I think most people prefer fantasy over non-fiction because fiction can give people the chance to live in a world they have always wanted to, at least temporarily. Non-fiction books are much harder to write because everything in them must be true, and supported by research. It's also more difficult to make non-fiction interesting to read.|`|z36j8rmRaa	Fiction is harder to write and sell.  It has to be really good.  There are far more genres in the non-fiction sector.  So I say non-fiction is read by more people than fiction.  I'm a lover of fiction myself!|`|wKSvnna2aa	I don't know, but I honestly prefer fiction, especially lengthy novels. Not all contain fantastical elements.     The only non-fiction book I truly liked was Anne Frank's Diary.|`|e2J4r10Raa	I love to read non-fiction, its my favorite. but every once in awhile I can read a good fiction or fantasy book. His Dark Materials is awesome!|`|JPlVt9xYaa	In a lot of cases neither is pure in the genre that is indicated. We have found a lot of our scientific journals to be wrong, and isn't that fiction? We have found our medical text books, changed with the advent of new and better techniques.    On the other hand, I write what is called fiction, but I have selected actual happenings in history and I have inserted some futuristic beliefs, which might be true someday and some mystical occurrences that could happen to someone. So, my fiction has some fact. I think the simplest way for me out of this, is to say, the non-fiction we read at any given point in time, might be fiction at a later point in time. Life is a mystery and it is meant to be that way. There are no absolutes and that too is the way it is. Life is a wonderful mystery and will never be solved with non-fiction ideas. Forgive me, but that is the way I see it.
f119152bd1437cee7c5e5e39298c2733aa	how about a guitar?  You can get one for $300  A question to you :  What kind of music do you like?  If you don't enjoy what you are playing then you will not stick with it.  So what kind of music do you enjoy?  Easy?   It is only easy if you enjoy what you are doing  If you are not playing something you enjoy, then it will be hard  I play my guitar and sometimes 20 minutes seems like 10 hours  BUT  The next day I will plan on playing for maybe 15 minutes and look back at the clock and a hour will have passed  Seems when I just do what I love, things go smooth and time flies  So the question comes back to you :  What do you enjoy?

" June 2008 Update: In response to the outrageous number of emails that I have received with questions concerning Midnight Sun, I talked to Stephenie this weekend and she asked me to let everyone know that Midnight Sun is her next project. She has not yet finished writing it (and there is no timeline set up, so we all need to put a lot of effort into being patient for a while longer), but she is definitely still planning on having it published. And, after Breaking Dawn comes out, Stephenie will have much more time to focus on writing Midnight Sun. "    now im beginning to think she will finish it... but like i said we'll just have to wait and see! ^_^|`|SDLLNyX5aa	Last I heard, she wasn't working on it, since someone had leaked part of it online without her permission and she felt too hurt and betrayed to work on it, so she put it off till later.

3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	I would just re-write it with a little more clarity:    Voltaire's Candide is a satire on optimism. Voltaire challenges the belief expressed by Gottfried Leibnitz [explain who this is]  that we live in the best of all possible worlds, and everything happens for the best. Throughout the novel Voltaire places his characters in the worst possible situations in order to persuade the reader that evil does indeed exist in the world and that the world is not totally good, nor is it the best it could be.  Through a series of events, Voltaire shows how man is sometimes responsible for the good and evil that come into his life and his world, but good and evil can also come into his life by circumstances beyond his control..|`|z36j8rmRaa	I think is sounds pretty good.  You need to reread though.  Your punctuation is lacking.    Blessings!|`|QMbaeva9aa	I haven't read Candide but by reading the paragraph I get the gist of the book. Good.    Your second sentence is hard to understand. I had to read it a few times before I realised that Gottfried is a character in the story. I don't think it's a necessary detail anyway. You can talk about him later. Focus on what the purpose of Candide is.    Your sentences need to flow better. Play around with combining/ splitting sentences, word order, cutting words.

AA10015648	The prologue is about a soul named Fords Deep Waters, who's a human taken over by a parasite alien (soul). Fords puts Wanderer, a soul, into Melanie's body.     The first chapter is Wanderer experiencing Melanie's last memories... When souls are put into bodies, they relive the last thing that the body remembers, so Wanderer remembers Melanie running away from the seekers, and her jumping down an elevator shaft to kill herself.     The first 1/4 of the book is all about Wanderer learning how to be a human, and try to ignore Melanie's consciousness which is still alive.|`|ISnGWFDzaa	Wanderer is a soul that inhabits Melanie's body, but Melanie's is still there in her mind and refuses to leave. This takes place after the world comes to an end|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Yes, I had your same problem, it is sonfusing at the start but keep reading and it will all make sense.  What happens in the first chapter is Wanderer (hte soul) is inserted into Melanie( her host)
5LiXKwVOaa	Oh lordy I wish this could work for me, I'm in the same situation as you! What I would do Is ask your friends who already have dates if they have any guy friends your age that don;t go to your school and might be interested in going. Maybe check out some teen clubs in your city, if you have any. Good luck and remember; there is nothing wrong with going alone! It's better then settling for some nerd who thinks your hot but completely repulses you.    Also, most school dances only play about 3 slow songs, the rest of the time your just dancing in your cloud of friends so a date is not necessary to have a good time.
5wF7FOqwaa	Books by Agatha Christie are fairly good, and so is The Falconer's Knot by Mary Hoffman, an intriguing murder story that takes place in Italy. Also, for some mystery/clue-solving, you might want to try The 39 Clues. The first book, The Maze of Bones, is by Rick Riordan. Gordon Korman wrote the second one, A False Note. The third one, The Sword Thief by Peter Lerangis, is coming out on March 3.|`|cHxaWW0taa	Anything book written by Agatha Christie|`|ASwTNY89aa	A Great and Terrible Beauty by Libba Bray is a mystry/historical fiction/fanasty book.

YEfW3vI0aa	Yeah it is interesting, needs some grammar fixing -up,   but I think people will be put off by that last line you wrote, it is against the community guidelines, to report people unecessarily look it up.|`|KGj1dxhQaa	the first 2 ish paragraphs were good, but then it got super dramatic really fast. i also don't think a parent would use the word affair with a kid. it was good, especially for a 12 year old. keep working on it, and send it to someone to read. see what a pro thinks and good luck!|`|ZC4ZNVzGaa	I think it needs a lot of work. The grammar isn't very good. I mean it's not horrible grammar, but there were a lot of noticeable mistakes.    The story seems rushed, too. And I personally don't think the subject of divorce in this snippet was written well at all. The part where her parents were discussing it with her made me cringe a bit and the way her dad just came right out and said he was having an affair could have been done better.     I didn't like it. I went back and read the other part you just put up and it's waaay too rushed and over dramatized. It needs to be re written differently and then I can definantly see it having some potential. Just tell your child to go back and re read and edit more! =)|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	I didn't finish reading it.   It seemed alright, but good enough for publishing? No.  It's generic. Done before.   But she seems to have talent for a twelve year old. So keep motivating her to continue writing.    But I hope you and daughter don't get your hopes up, not yet, It's EXTREMELY tough for adults who have been writing for years to get published let alone a twelve year old girl.

It is important to be open and honest   as well as to care  for each other   when the time is needed.  It doesn't matter if the friends is female or   male   What matters is communication   I like the lines you said shoulder to lean on   when someone has died   this shows sympathy  The last two lines in your poem   because this is true   about true friends.  Friends don't have to be heroes   but instead each one be yourself   and accept each other.|`|0BioKSmaaa	I lOVed the second stanza..absolutely brilliant   i think you're ending may need a little work because it feels a little loose, maybe a rhyme would do the trick?   other than that, i think you managed to steer clear from all the cliches that come with a friendship poem and i think yours is the first one that i've seen, that has done that  so well done   keep penning jacob :D
Qas05nZraa	great|`|0BioKSmaaa	I actually really enjoyed it!   it has a very somber tone to it but at the same time you feel the light of tomorrow - hope   a very symbolic poem - and i feel its very relevent to the time we're living in now...things may seem hopeless but there will be a light at the end of the tunnel   nicely written :)   keep penning :D

It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too. So yeah.. you should check it out

The part at the end seems repetitious.  You ask for courage to accept the things  you cannot change and then wisdom to accept the things you cannot change.  The phrase usually says "the wisdom to know the difference."  I would actually leave that out altogether because it is not original and the rest of it is.    I think the beginning is very strong.  It seems like it starts to lose focus as it goes along. It doesn't even seem like you're writing about the same topic.  Keep it about your mother.  Don't try too hard to use "profound" words when simple ones would better convey your meaning.  What, for example, is a "backward abysmal?"  Do you mean abyss?    You made a great start, and you clearly have a good vocabulary and some talent for writing.  Stop trying so hard and rework this into something that isn't so obscure.  Edit:  Kiwi, obviously I wrote my answer before you made your correction.  I still think you should just omit that part, because you've misquoted the original proverb, and it doesn't seem to fit, anyway.    Keep at it--you'll end up with something very good.

Third, you're either crazy or this is a joke.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	Actually, Hannibal Lector does not exist...the character was based off a man from a town called Plainsfield, WI that was using human skin and bones (both from murder victims and robbing graves) to make things such as lamp shades and trinkets for himself.  His name was Ed Gein, and the characters from "The Silence of the Lambs", "Psycho", and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" were based on this man.    So...unless the woman you are speaking to is actually named "Gein" and a necrophyliac (meaning she has sex with corpses), then you're speaking to a liar.  Ed Gein died a single man in 1984, having never married.      I know this because I watched the documentary on A & E, but if you don't believe me, here is further proof which I found for you...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein|`|DVy20VtFaa	Well, I believe you. I've talked to her too. I really think it's true. If you wanna talk about it, email me at girly_girl1394@yahoo.com OR my AIM is vickytoria1394

X605sT7oaa	I wouldn't be nervous, it sounds like she can't dance either. "I only dirty dance" Hmm.  Seriously you just need to be able to count to four. Practice in front of your mirror. Don't be self conscious because you are going to be surrounded by like 100 other people dancing at the same time, no-one is really going to notice if you go wrong - which you won't!  Keep it simple, and just don't step on her feet. :D  x|`|X1jupF0paa	start by moving your feet left to right in time with the music, if you can count to four you can dance.
R2NmvZtZaa	Yea you can, but character shoes would be more helpful.|`|2ucN3YXRaa	A lot of people just wear tennis shoes and jeans when they dance salsa. It can be fun to dress up in a dress or skirt and high heels, but it's not a requirement.    If you buy heels to dance in be sure they support your ankle so you don't end up getting a sprain.    I have  bought dance shoes over the internet and was very happy wth the quality and fit, so if you really want salsa dancing shoes and they don't sell them in your town you might try that.|`|ttndIYgFaa	Yeah, But be carful thought you could trip easyily.|`|3icIYGtdaa	Check out this page for a ton of salsa shoes, most at really good prices:    http://best-prices-online.com/?q=salsa+s...
d2hrH6EEaa	Alright Fantine's arrest is very early in the beginning of the movie. I've never seen the movie just read the book. After they go through Jean Valjean's history/crime crap then they show Fantine she gets arrested after becoming a prostitute and fighting with the prospective customer. Very early in the movie(well at least in the book and so I assume same in the movie)  Hope I helped!  Favorite book ever, it rocks!!!!!!
hJP9y6kjaa	In short, yes, I do think so.    A mahogany body in general will give a warmer, rounder, rich tone, and the JB is a pickup that has more treble and mid-presence. This emphasis will help it cut through the mix very well, I feel that it balances out the tone of mahogany very well. There's a reason why the JB in the bridge and the '59 in the neck are the most popular pickup combination in the world!    According to DiMarzio.com, the 36th Anniversay PAF neck is pretty well-balanced. In the description of the pickup itself they said that one of their aims was to keep the bass strings from being too muddy - if its patterned after classic PAF pickups, then keep in mind that a lot of those older guitars were indeed mahogany. I would absolutely expect this pickup to have a great clean and lead tone. It will not be very bright, more of a "round warm" sound vs the brighter middy/treble sound of the JB.    Keep in mind that there are a lot of little modifications you can do to your electronics to tailor the sound to your guitar...  including changing the pot and cap values.    So the normal value of humbucker volume pots is 500kohms (kilo ohms). If the pickup is simply too bright, put in 250kohm pots. Too dark? Put in 1 Meg ohm pots. Need the tone control to cut less or more treble (ie too effective or not effective enough)? Change the cap value... umm....  links below... =)      Good luck!        Saul|`|Ow3O7h4caa	Hi Tenacious    I have DiMarzio's on my old 1969 Les Paul. Awesome sound. Back in those days, we didn;t have much choice in pick-ups but what you are mentioning sound darn close to my pickups.  They have a sweet tone, balance between warmth and clarity, the ability to go from clean to distorted by pick attack alone which is what I loved when I installed DiMarzio back in the days.    As for the bridge,  good choice as long as you know what you are doing. As funny as it may seem, this pickup is for an advanced guitar player. No joke and if this was put on a plywood guitar, then you would have cried.  On the Dean, good choice although this pickup is not made to play rhythm and is krap. For lead.....perfect.

f3dc149e269805dc7d0ab808ec739403aa	"The Killer Angels," by Michael Shaara, is excellent.  The story of the Battle of Gettysburg, it's in the form of a novel, and it's fascinating -- really brings these old historical figures to life. If I'd read this in high school, I would have become much more interested in history.  If I had a "Top Ten" list, this one would be on it -- highly recommended.|`|0dbe0a99a0826d3ced28e7602f87d8a5aa	I've read the Kite Runner and I'm reading A Thousand Spendid Suns now I love them both|`|AA10403253	I read Kite Runner a while back but I can still remember everything.

wKSvnna2aa	I'm not a Twilight fan but a girl, and I can tell you that the perfect guy is kind, not abusive or perverted, is intelligent and fun to be with, and overall listens to what you say and shares some of your interests. You don't need to be super-beautiful, but honestly it's only human nature to be attracted to beautiful/handsome people. Just take care of yourself, smell nice (bathe regularly, etc.), and you'll be just fine. Anyway, beauty really is in the eye of the beholder. And look for not only a pretty girl, but also one who has brains. There are lots of beautiful ladies, and also handsome men, but not all have very interesting things to say in a conversation.    Hope this helps.    ~Sara|`|WNFlpxdHaa	Stalk her. Watch her sleep. Bruise her body. Dont let her have any guy friends. And their you go, you're now Edward Cullen!|`|5L5GQYFXaa	okay these answers are stupid!  If you want qualities that edward has then i would go with: caring,crooked smile,laugh,be mysterious but not too much too irritate the people you`re around.  But they are right saying that edward is not perfect...  I would go with some of jacobs qualities too:  be a best friend, someone to go to when you want a break from your problems,    So if you can be what this is you`ll see that being a person people will want is not only outside but into your personality too    hope this helped|`|usvPMtMtaa	be a pedophile  then you're all set!!|`|UtzALxfjaa	Re-read your question and slap yourself.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Oh, gods. Why would you want to be like him? If every girl you meet is obsessed with Edward, perhaps you should wait until you meet some who aren't. Edward is a creepy, controlling, over-possessive stalker.

Don't! Don't succumb to the Twilight madness! Meyer is hiding a terrible secret, and it is that Edward Cullen is NOT perfect!     Shocking, isn't it?    Think about it, he is abusive to Bella. He stalks her breaks into her room to watch her sleep. He does this for weeks before she even finds out. Then he hijacks her car in order to make her yield to his demand of getting a safer car. Plus, he's a sparkly vampire. Big turn off right there.     In reality, it's probably not a good idea to model yourself after a fictitious character. Just be kind and courteous to a girl. Show her respect by doing little things like following the ladies first rule, opening the door for her, etc. Be a gentleman. And most importantly, be yourself. You don't want a girl who likes you because you are just like Edward, but a girl who likes you for you.    And if you want my opinion, it's a turn off when a guy wants to be like Edward Cullen. And I don't get this obsession over Edward, there are better literary characters out there. Haven't you heard of Edward Rochester or Fitzwilliam Darcy?|`|M627my7Baa	Wow, first of all I'd tell you not to worry about being a fictional vampire. But if you really feel you must, then of course you'd have to start reading the books.     If you can't make the effort to pick up a book and read about the person you want to become, then I can already tell you it's a lost cause. "Ladies, I want to impress you. But not enough to make the actual effort. Only if someone else tells me how."     Don't worry about the eye thing. Look people in their eyes, and if they say anything or seem distracted, just say, "Oh, I had eye surgery and it's still healing." No big deal.     Just forget Edward Cullen.|`|bdfk2d49aa	By trying to not be like him at all.|`|dD4rvGOraa	You really wanna be like edward?!  Think bout it...he abuses bella, he breaks into her house and watches her sleep, he has his sister pack her nothing but lacy underwear, and he glitters in the sun.

JOChNigNaa	This is better, but has a few rough spots "I draw my breath in sighs" has redundancy.  I draw in deep sighs. or I breath with halting sighs, might be more descriptive without three breaths draw, breath, sighs that only seem to reduplicate the same movement of air.  Stars shine bright is a discordant contrast of something light and constant, not at all ambivalent.  Why not have the stars dimly flicker?  To cry out is vocal, not optic, A silent scream would go ."My heart cries out deep laments" or "My eyes cry tears, my voice laments"  (You could even put a shudder in there along with a sob).  I like the ghostly presence in the last verse, but leave the comma out of the last line, it would seem to serve no purpose.  You can cut some pronouns later on, we are already in the intimate space of you and him. A rogue to all who knew.

"You were a bright star, yet I'm ambivalent" conveys that contradiction better, but there's difficulty in flow with the rest of the stanza.  The then and now is kind of a time stretch.

My other friend read it as well but didn't like how the story goes, and how Bella is so easily drawn to Edward.  She thought Bella was a "victim."

Those "vampires" are not true to any to the legends that created the vampire myths! Meyer should have just made her own creatures rather than borrowing the vampire title to stick to her creations.   I'm not going to list what is wrong with the book. It's not hard to find, so go find it yourself. I'm not going to waste my time.|`|5wF7FOqwaa	Some people don't like Twilight because it completely twists the very idea of vampires. According to them, vampires should not be like Meyer's vampires, where they drink animal blood and are all pretty and civilized. It also doesn't seem very plausible that a vampire and a human could fall in love. Finally, those haters are used to characters having flaws to make them realistic, but Meyer's vampires have no flaws. They actually have gifts to make them even more perfect.|`|E28mQDX0aa	Contrary to what Twilight fans think, most, if not all, haters have read the book. I get really sick of explaining this.... is it so hard to believe? I mean, what's the point of hating on something that you haven't even read and given a fair chance?    I hate it for many reasons. I found the writing to be very amateurish, with purple prose, overuse of adverbs and adjectives, Mary Sue self insert main female character and basic grammar, spelling and sentence structure problems that would have been easily caught had Meyer actually read over what she had written or her editor had actually done their job.    Also, hated the story line... it was really nothing but the "romance" between Edward and Bella until page 400 or so, when something final happened and it went by so quickly and wasn't explained well at all (plus, Bella conveniently fainted so Meyer didn't have to write the fight scene between James and the Cullens, a complete cop-out if you ask me) it seemed to me that it was just added because Meyer realized that something besides the "romance" between Bella and Edward had to happen.    Bella was the most annoying protagonist I have ever had the displeasure of reading about and so obviously a self insert of Stephenie Meyer. My God, she was so whining and annoying! Plus, she was so dependent on Edward, it was disgusting. She practically freaked out if he wasn't in the same room as her. Also, her and Edward are not in "love" they are in lust. Their relationship is based entirely on physical characteristics. She likes him because he's hot and he likes her because she smells good.    Plus, Meyer's logic makes absolutely no sense and she contradicts herself a lot too. Also, she gets all whiny when people criticize her and she proceeds to blamed THEM for not "understanding" or some crap like that.    I am a huge vampire fan (more into romances, but whatever). That's what drew me to Twilight in the first place. I liked her ideas about vampires until Edward started sparkling... I'm sorry, but No. Just NO. Vampires don't sparkle. By doing that, they are no longer scary or evil in the slightest. And also, no fangs?! How the hell can they bite into their pray with no fangs? No amount of strong teeth would be able to do that without making a huge mess! That's why vampires logically have fangs... it makes it easier and less messy!     Honestly, Twilight is an embarrassment to vampire literature.|`|7eEEIJlcaa	i agree! i dont understand people who dont like twilight!  the books are amazing!  oops...sorry im not a twilight hater haha|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	Oh god...I've read it..

For me the problem with twilight is not the vampire/human love thing, or the cheesyness, cliches etc. It's that fact that SM made bella to be a completely useless, clumsy, insecure, pathetic girl that I can't relate to or sympathize with. I think it's horrible that her Mary Sue has become a girl to look up to and aspire to be like. This book basically told me that you don't have to be smart, put together, or confident to get the hottest guy ever and and have everything you want which in my opinion is wrong. My other problem with it is that SM uses far too many descriptive, repetitive adjectives which get to be too much. I don't need to hear about Edward's golden eyes, and marble skin a zillion times. I also don't like how she did no research about vampire myths and didn't include and vampire mythology in her portrayal of the cullens/vampires, i mean vegetarian vampires come on.     Anyways I have read the books all 4... not everyone is going to like them. I did give them a chance, I actually didn't mind the first one, but after reading the other 3, and then how huge it got, it's just gotten out of andcontrol, and old (in my opinion). I prefer Dracula, but that's just me    cheers
AA12016117	In the Middle Ages?  Burning has been known throughout the centuries.<br>  <br>  In medieval and renaissance Europe, burning was more prevalent as a punishment than in England.  It was used in Spain (the Inquisition, as the Church forbad the spilling of blood), Germany as it was then, France, Switzerland and the Nordic countries.  <br>  <br>  Usually associated with the punishment of heresy and witchcraft, in England, at least, it was for treason and petty treason.  Anne Boleyn, for instance (second wife of Henry VIII of England), was sentenced to burning or beheading for adultery, which was treason in a queen.  (Petty treason was adultery for an ordinary person.)  Henry had her sentence commuted to beheading.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	The U.S. and those European Countries where the Church was the state for sure.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Most of western Europe did as well as Catholic nations in eastern Europe.<br>  <br>  There are a few examples of this practice being used in the Americas as well.

mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  This is an extremely good book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.|`|2DuNiH7oaa	The Twilight Saga is good for almost anyone and books by Meg Cabot.|`|xZQjK7oKaa	Hail Caeser. Written by a 17 year old, and it's cute. The main character is shallow, but he changes. It's good.|`|oMn8Euliaa	I suggest the book "The Chocolate War" by Robert Cormier.  It will make you look at your life a little bit.  It's off of the norm and it's so amazing.  Even though i read it for the first time ten years ago, i still think about it and have read it several times since. Hope that helps.|`|TlqSAM0naa	The Barcode Tattoo and The Barcode Rebellion    They are futuristic about all teens && everyone older having to get a barcode tattoo that has all of your money accounts and other private information.

7eEEIJlcaa	becuase ive heard that when youre pregnant you crave weird things and some things taste or smell really bad to you when they are actually fine to a normal person    and the volturi have milky eyes becuase theyve been underground for so long  they never leave  theyre food comes to them  so theyre eyes have become creepy looking haha    i hope this helps!|`|J7o7FtZdaa	I think the fried chicken was a little undercooked, and she wasn't feeling good because of being pregnant would be my guess. And the Volturi's eyes are milky because they are so old and have been sitting around for so long.|`|ZC4ZNVzGaa	Is it really necessary to ask another Twilight question about why Bella doesn't like the fried chicken? Honestly. Just read on and go with your instinct or something. Maybe then you'll find out more.|`|cKuHXJQyaa	the chicken tastes odd because it wasn't fully cooked.|`|CJIZpXp8aa	my guess is because human food doesn't appeal to the baby.|`|TCQP2iShaa	Umm...well Bella was pregnant with Renesmee who is half vampire and vampires don't tend to like KFC so the taste wasn't particularly appealing to her... remember the part where Edward took a bite out of pizza? Same thing, just because they can eat it doesn't mean they like it. Bella had a little vampire baby in her so yeah...|`|1Uk4kBwyaa	um...the fried chicken WAS off,  the volturi have milky eyes because they are so infatuated by their own power that they cannot see the world preperly any more|`|ZW24GerXaa	the reason the chicken tastes off to bella is because the baby is half vampire, and as edward explains in twilight, vampires dont like to eat food. her baby wants blood, not food.   the reason the volturi's eyes are milky rather than just red is because they are centuries old, and so it changes their appearance kind of. for example, Bella explains Aro's skin looking very smooth, and it wasnt like carlisle's skin. thats because of his age.    I hope this helps!

AA12257113	Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is not unfair; it is an ideal that some of us still strive for.    Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness becomes ambiguous when we act like those ideals are for everyone except for 'them'.|`|y8cXzvpxaa	someone else has got to be sad so that the other may be happy. ya know?    we both wanted pie but i got it and you didnt. i'm happy and you're not.    so i guess it is a little unfair since we can't always get what we want when everyone is trying to pursue their dreams.|`|AA11703549	Ambiguous, definitely because they're all very general terms:    What does it mean to have life? Does that just mean you're not going to kill us? or is there a standard of life that we get? Because a lot of people are pretty good at promising not to kill us.     Liberty? Well anyone with half a brain knows that that's not unleashed. Liberty to do anything you want would end in chaos, so there has to be limits and that statement says nothing in the way of limits.     Pursuit of happiness? what does that even mean? Are you saying I have the right to do what makes me feel good? because quite frankly, cocaine really helps me with that.     As far as any of it being unfair, I'm not sure. I mean, one man's liberty and pursuit of happiness could very well impede on another man's. And one babies right to life could very well be against the wishes of the pregnant woman. So to someone, it's going to be unfair.|`|i6d582PFaa	ambiguous, yes  unfair, how?    pursuit of happiness can mean doing anything YOU think will bring you happiness, even being sad. It's only as fair as you make it. Only as ambiguous as well.|`|vuKD7je1aa	because they are immaterial ideas; they are artificial human constructs, they are simply "thought-up" by a feeble mind with a feeble intelligence.
ZW24GerXaa	i kno exactly wut u mean, i mean y r they getting mad about the leak and reading it if they supposedly have the book?? i gues they got mad or something cuz, since the book was leaked, it got postponed. but i dont kno how they have books wen there hasnt been ne news on it being finished or published. if they were mad about the leak, then they shouldnt hav even read it on the internet to begin with. but idk how that works, i guess some pl r just weird, and dont hav ne thing else to complain about.|`|ezVqz0bBaa	I have NOO idea, I am a HUGE twilight saga fan but I don't have any reason to want to the partial, unedited version against Stephenie Meyer's wishes. People who are true Twilight fans, won't read it until it's meant to be out...|`|n9p80eaUaa	do NOT get ur hopes up ive been waiting too but it may not come out   :( she may not finish it im sad hahaha WAAA|`|ASwTNY89aa	I think Midnight Sun lame|`|tTkLgQduaa	i don't know why people would read it, i mean it is just twilight again...|`|jxSNecnyaa	There's a debate about whether or not Stephanie Meyer might even FINISH writing the book, because someone illegally leaked a partial draft. That doesn't seem fair. If I were Stephanie I wouldn't finish the book either. I haven't read the partial draft at all.. Even when Stephanie put it on her website, stating that since she might not finish the book we may as well read it there. But I'm not going to because If she does finish it, I want to be able to read the book without having to mentally edit it and besides, it's a partial draft, which means some things could change between the partial draft and the actual book. And I would rather buy the book and promote Stephanie Meyer than read a rough drafted partial draft.  That's my opinion on the whole thing.  Other than that, I love the sega.. I mean L.O.V.E. it!!! I used to love harry potter, but The Twilight Sega is so much more... And no offence to some people.. but I H.A.T.E. Jacob Black. He had NO right.. Edward and Bella were meant to be together for Eternity.    ~daydreams~ Edward...     lolllll :D|`|cKuHXJQyaa	it's on stephenie meyer's website, so she wants her fans to read the rough draft.    it's only the first 200 and some pages, though.    i've only read like the first 20 pages because i want to wait until it gets published so i can read it all, and not stop in the middle of it.|`|Wme29krvaa	Because we're obsessed and stupid and have been waiting a LONG time for midnight sun to come out. Plus we all thought it was fake anyway, so in our minds what was the damage? We didn't know it was actually real until Stephenie said so. Nothing we can do about it now and I'm not going to feel guilty for reading something that was on the internet for all to see. So whatever, we all just have to deal with it.
3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	You pretty much answered your own question. Scientology is an absurd religion which has only been around for 30-40 years. Christianity at least has the benefit of more than 2000 years of tradition. Plus, Christianity has the benefit of no one really knowing what happened 2000 years ago. The idea of a virgin birth and resurrection are difficult to believe, but at least I have to acknowledge that I don't know for sure.|`|trMsK86jaa	Because although Scientologists consider themselves to be part of a Religion, they don't Act religious.    Just Mental.|`|6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	Because most of us prefer their own fantasies.   It's one mark of Believers that they can't see their own follies, but need reassurance by dismissing everything else.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	The creator of Scientology realize a long time ago that all religions are created to become rich so he also create one just as ridiculous as the other religions.|`|4aa8824c12babfd0fa8da8f2f1cf115faa	Scientology is to other religions as other religions are to atheists, and for the same reasons!|`|UD2X3e3Paa	Well, you're right in saying that religion has been the ruin of the world in many, many ways.    But, Scientology has earned its reputation for good reason...it's absolutely ridiculous.|`|VjbJYqSPaa	i agree but really it's just the fact that the media and television has  poked and made fun of it,South park made an episode on it, and people don't know what it is. and also the fact that tom cruise is the "poster boy" for the religion.|`|Sbmte7psaa	ppl are scared of what they don't understand|`|8PYvV2Zkaa	I think i love you...anyway in response to the question, yes i completely agree. People put stock in things that have been around longer, it's a combination of "listen to you elders", and "if so many people believe it, how can it be wrong?"|`|lZ8Q2nxEaa	In my opinion,   generally very religious people tend to be close-minded. I guess it's not a bad thing but I don't favor it.    Lately I have been pondering the same question.    I also think christianity hasn't really been around the longest, but it's just been more popular and spread around. Christianity is often forced on a person.|`|6abb0d6590cdc272570c33416665d522aa	There is nothing that makes one religion more reasonable than another?  Sure about that? lol....|`|ZEBsp37waa	Its all up to personal perception, if i had been brought up in a christian household going to church every Sunday and saying prayers etc. then I'm sure that i would think every other religion was idiotic because "God" says so.  If i was raised in a Scientology environment then id think the opposite.  But i think Scientology cops a lot more than other religions simply because of a few bad examples.  Tom Cruise is one i believe, he is also the one that went mad on Oprah and started jumping on a couch.  And when your looking for things to badmouth, and bad examples pop up then your going to attack the source.  Basically, all religions just want to force their close-minded opinions onto other people, and it really annoys me.    Oh and just to throw this out there for your personal knowledge, Buddhism is a little more believable than other religions mainly for the fact that Buddha was a real life Indian prince.  At least we have proof for once.|`|rvt7wlIWaa	i don't think other religions are as ridiculous scientology. other religions have historic backing . judaism islam and christianity all share very similar versions of creation and the time following then go off it different directions after that. but scientology has no real historic evidence to back up it's story quite similar to the mormons. other religious people make fun of scientology because they think they are right in believing in what they believe. other religions are accepted not because  they have be around longer but during that time they have had a significant on the world. Society is based around the teaching of the popular religions. To know why other religious people make fun of scientology you just need to ask:  How did it come to be?  How far back can it be dated?  Why is it only the wealthy that are members?  What has scientology done for the world?|`|vOZoihUlaa	Aside from your offensive tone ("crap," etc), no well educated person could find reason to agree with your statement.  Take your example, Christianity: thousands of eye witnesses say a great teacher and wonder-worker is publicly executed (according to exacting Roman standards) yet appears over the next forty days following his burial.  Most of these eye witnesses are not followers of his until after they say that see him risen from the dead.  The great atheist writer and historian H.G.Wells said of this man, Jesus, that "all the armies that ever marched, and all the navies that ever were built, and all the parliaments that ever sat, and all the kings that ever reigned, put together, have not affected the life of man upon this earth as powerfully as that one solitary life."  One needn't believe in Jesus' divinity (Wells didn't and I don't) but obviously what he described as world-altering is a far cry from a small cult based on the novels of a science fiction writer.  Sorry, you've got a lot to learn about both history and respect for others' beliefs.|`|Mv4oL2DXaa	Religion in itself is ridiculous. Everyone believes something different. There is no way to tell which in is wrong, which in is right, or there is even a need for religion. I think that Christianity is publicly accepted simply because so many people already believe in it. Those people have children, pass the beliefs on to their children, and it goes on from there. In general, Scientology is made fun of because there aren't so many people that believe in it. Christians have support from other Christians. Less known religions, such as Scientology aren't as supported from the general public. So yes, I agree, the "ridiculous" beliefs of Christians are seen as normal or correct simply because it's what people were raised believing, and what many people across the world believe and support.|`|y8cXzvpxaa	i totally agree. my friend made this point yesterday when i laughed at how tom cruise believed in scientology.    maybe religious people laugh because it's not far fetched enough like the other religions. could it be possible that aliens had placed us here as test specimen? perhaps they are observing us from afar and taking notes. but i refuse to believe anything unless i have strong evidence.|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	because its just ridiculous. its WAY more rediculous than others. it doesnt even have a god!|`|IAXhu2tuaa	"Do they not realize that their own religion is just as RIDICULOUS?"    I have to give you credit for admitting that your religion is ridiculous.|`|cb7YfH5caa	1 because they believe aliens left us here or something like that idk i'm agnostic    -unknown|`|3tnVVFjHaa	agree.|`|t2LOcPkLaa	of course it's true, but Christianity and Judaism are at least founded in thousands of years of history and tradition. Scientology was created by a science fiction writer, is notorious for demanding people's money, and appears to be a cult.|`|849d6b13631f1ba99a0c1e7655b40d5faa	Scientology is more a cult than a religion, but I do agree with your basic premise.|`|CjkT6ZjNaa	disagree|`|wVyUdJJzaa	well i'm not apart of any religion and to be honest, i find scientology very "different" so in a way i disagree|`|3RsV1ZHBaa	probably because a fiction novelist founded Scientology, rather than being inspired by a divine being.|`|9vjhBWtLaa	-It was created by a science fiction writer  -it demands large amounts of money from its followers  -they run themselves like some kind of organized crime group, attacking in various ways those who speak out against them
5wF7FOqwaa	I would suggest The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. It's about a boy, Bruno, who meets a boy in striped pajamas, who is really a Jew in a concentration camp. Unfortunately, Bruno is too young to understand the bias towards Jews. A Northern Light is a really girly book.|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	The boy in Striped Pajamas.|`|LcRo9okTaa	the boy in striped pajamas!!!!! :]|`|GJdDaZNraa	A Northern Light? Is that the same as Northern lights? coz then you should do northen lights|`|ZC4ZNVzGaa	Both are good choices, I'd personally go with The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. But then again, I don't know a lot of people who have heard of or read A Northern Light, so maybe you could choose the one that not too many people have read yet or know about?
8zujEO9taa	I guess I enjoyed them both, I mean they were kind of similar- in writing, storyline (by that I mean pace, action etc)  I don't know if I like that the characters are so compatible, it's a bit too fairy tale for my liking.   They're pretty good books though, they did suck me right in!
f595f51912c467d68eab3d0fedf6e468aa	You want to print on a glossy paper stock. In the printing industry, this is known as "gloss enamel" and you can order it "C1S" (coated one side) or "C2S" (coated two sides). Check with your local office supply store for inket or laser paper that indicates it is gloss coated. C1S, if  you can find it, will be cheaper. You can also contact any local paper mill and ask for samples of Productolith C1S 60  text (weight) paper for offset printing. This is a very common product.    Any gloss coated paper may be difficult to run through your printer. By trial and error you can determine which settings to use.    My experience is that the Office Max house brand of "business paper" (for presentations) works quite well, while the HP brand refuses to go through my laser printer. Why? The heat curls, and often jams the paper. What's the difference? By me. The Office Max brand is a lot cheaper and works better. Go figure!    Good luck!

If a werewolf imprints on someone it is because those two people are soul mates. It's just fate, it is the way it is supposed to be. It's like someone waiting for 'the one' and not having to make any effort in the search because 'the one' found them and the universe connected them.    No, it isn't weird. Technically he is 17. His body is 100+ years old. And that doesn't even matter because it is frozen, it isn't like he is decaying or anything.|`|FLfmkNEAaa	SHUTUP ALREADY IT MEANS YOU GO TO HE*****************************|`|ASwTNY89aa	If someone doesnt like you back and wants you as a freind then you would be the best friend you could be.|`|jN0njYgjaa	this is unbeliavable.........God kill us! kill us now!!|`|4FqP313qaa	in the words of jacob, 'its hard to ignore that much devotion.' at least i think thts sorta how he said it..? (i dont keep a copy of new moon open for research) alls i kno is, bella asked the same question.  edward was only like 100 mentally. physically, he was 17.|`|2DAfAjv2aa	If they don't like you back, then you would still remain their friend. I guess you could say that it's unconditional love. Usually, though, when someone imprints, the other person can't help but love them back. That's because when you imprint, you find your soul mate, and that applies to both people.    Edward's stuck in the body of a seventeen year old, though. It just means that he's wiser, and I don't think that's weird.|`|kHR47Vjyaa	Firstly, only werewolves (shapeshifters) can imprint. And if a werewolf imprints, the imprintee does love him/her back, that's sorta the point. Finding your soulmate and all :)  And I don't think Edward and Bella is weird. But I guess, maybe some people do. All's fair in love :D|`|byEI0oNOaa	With imprinting, the feeling is on both sides. There isn't a way to imprint w/o both people feeling the same way. Edward is over 100 but he is stuck at age 17 physically. The only difference between the two is that he is wiser- there isn't anything wrong/weird with that. These answers are just my speculations, take them as you want to. Have a great night :)      Para KID~eliminatetwilighters :  No hay nada malo en pedir de nuevo.

Like maybe that other person was "meant" to be with the other so of course that someone would like the werewolf back.      Also, age is nothing but a number.|`|CJIZpXp8aa	When a werewolf imprints on someone, that girl is most likely to like them back seeing as they would be the most wonderful partners ever. Seriously, who wouldn't fall in love with someone who is perfect for them?    And it's not weird with Bella being so young, because Edward is frozen at 17, and even though he has lived way longer than just 17 years, he is still, in fact, another 17-year-old boy.
iNXqiDIYaa	the problem is the lack of money and the debts they owe to usurious money lenders
5wg7tKc6aa	I actually think anyone on here, who gets kicks out of bashing Twilight, or ranting about how great Twilight (and some.. specific characters)are, are slightly immature.  I mean, I guess the Twilighters are into their little book, and that's fine.  At least they're reading.  And I'll admit, I'm not a fan of the book.  But those of us, who aren't into the book, who go out of their way to bash it... it's just, pathetic?  What's the point.  Are they trying to get people to stop reading them?  If it's your interest, then why should people tell you other wise.    It's the same with religion.  I'm not religious at all, but I won't go out of my way to try and convert some religious person, or bash them for believing in what they believe in.    Super immature.    And such a waste of time, and energy.|`|S2AU75uQaa	Everyone just has to understand the real world.  There are nice people, and then you have the mean a s s h o l e s.  If everyone can accept & understand that, they will live a happy life & not let the mean people get to them, ever.    I love Twilight.  I'm not pathetic.  I'm not a follower.  I dont believe in vapires, werewolves, Edward Cullen, etc....  I read a book (well four books) and loved it, end of story.|`|yVKB4eehaa	>?  i love twilight but seriously this attack attempt isn't going to make haters stop. i think haters just dont like how twilight is all the hype now! everywhere you go, theres something twilight related and i myself have found it kind of weird and annoying sometimes. haha.    and twilighters arent pathetic...we're just a bit over the top at times! haha.|`|eFjbYMQfaa	U crazy fans examples:  Oh OMG twilight is the best!  Ooooh im in love with edward cullen  im edward cullens future wife!  I dont need a life I got twilight  I believe in vampires and faeries and hairy werewolves!  -------------------  Hmmm I wonder why we hate you.  we dont hate twilight the book is great but because of the annoying fans we get ticked off.|`|ZW24GerXaa	LMAO! i agree. they r always complaining and so mad that we like something they dont. their complaints are sometimes very funny. its not our fault they dont kno how to read a great series...and if they have read it then its not our fault they dont kno how to enjoy a great series. sure, the book had some grammar problems, but we kno wut stephanie meant to rite and its not going to ruin the book, thats wut a lot of twilight haters blame their hate for the book on, just the grammar problems. but still, their tantrums can b pretty funny. and then wen they post things on YA saying how much they hate us is funny too becuz they complain about how we run YA questions but them saying stuff about us on YA is just creating another twilight related question. its funny. i like to laugh at them sometimes, while they like to b annoyed with us. they have their complaints, but thats not gona stop us from loving the books or ne thing. NOTE TO TWILIGHT HATERS, WE WILL NOT SHUT UP ANYTIME SOON. AND JUST BECAUSE WE ASK A QUESTION ABOUT TWILIGHT ON YA, DOESNT MEAN WE R OBSESSED, WE JUST HAVE QUESTIONS. lol. the book never did ne thing to twilight haters. we havent done ne thing to them either, we just ask questions on YA cuz we r curious, its not hurting them. if they dont want to hear about twilight, then they shouldnt click on questions involving twilight. do u agree?|`|tJWfSeQ3aa	Right back at ya!|`|E28mQDX0aa	Actually, I don't.    But, I do laugh at the obsessed Twilight fans who insult me simply for not liking the book. Or the ones that go around thinking that Edward is actually real.    I mean, it's just a book, who cares if I hate it? If you can like it and say how much you love it, then why can't we say how much we don't like it?! It's called freedom of speech and a difference in a opinion.    Sure, some haters could be nicer, but then.. .so could some of the fans.    I mean, really... both fans and haters (at least some) are immature and pathetic. It's like they post questions just to piss off the other.|`|Um7mYM71aa	blar blar blar blar.............twilight is a book for under-age girls.......  blar blar blar blar.............get real.......................................  blar blar blar blar.............I've never read the book,I just hate the title......................................  blar blar blar blar.......................................|`|cHxaWW0taa	Your now trying to incite anger?   God, remind me not to make you a negotiator.|`|AA11703549	I don't think it's the book, because honestly, given the time and book, I'd give it a chance. It's the annoyance of constantly hearing people talk about it so that it's inescapable. It's the poor grammar and using numbers as words and letters in all caps to repeat yourself endlessly about the same stuff over and over again.    That's what peaks the tempers.     Not that I've thrown a temper tantrum over it yet. But have you ever been near a flock of seagulls that never shut up and the loudness and repetition of their call nearly drives you insane? Just keep thinking about that one....|`|GqrRBZ3faa	I believe it is funny. You guys ~are pathetic and just a bunch of followers. I read those books over a year ago and it pisses me off when 11 year olds read it because Robert is 'lyke so totes hott' or just because they saw the movie.  I loved Twilight, but then I had an epiphany! Bella is a weak character that no one should look up to, the writing is really terrible and I've found numerous mistakes, and the plot line couldn't be more cliche.    But I do agree. The people bashing Twilight aren't being any more mature than the tweens posting millions of questions on it.|`|TrbzmQAhaa	Yes, I do agree that Twilight (that's right, dear, it's spelled "Twilight")   fans do aptly fit the description of "pathetic". Not being able to spell the title of a book and series that you are nervously defending would be pretty danged funny, if it wasn't so, as you put it, pathetic.     Temper tantrums do not exactly describe my feelings and behavior when faced once again with this hyped pig tripe as I attempt to visit Yahoo Answers for some stimulating literary discussion.     What my feelings are, to tell you the truth, is a sorrow for how truly abysmal this nation's schools must be, and their products,in the evidence of  the deplorable want of discrimination required, for these fans to not only read one of the books without skimming or employing Reader's Amnesty, but to then go on to read the entire series and, apparently, a lot of you start right back over again, is baffling beyond description. .     With the staggering and formidable array of meaningful and worthy literature from all centuries and all corners of the earth, I just end up shaking my head at the shallow, taste-free waters in which these Twilit  masses dog-paddle.     You say I am hilarious. Child, you are to be pitied and, I am afraid, it is not funny  in the least. You are the little girl who is literally cutting off her nose to spite her face. ---enjoy----|`|mYAbq6fnaa	yeah its pretty hilarious how some people seem to really have something against twilight, i mean seriously, what did the poor book ever do to you? but yeah i LOVE twilight and the whole series. its awesome!|`|HBFCdAvRaa	Yes...I do think people kind of flip if people ask a question about Twilight. They say stuff like..TWILIGHT SUCKS. LEAVE. But...I can see why people get annoyed. :]|`|SSmM05guaa	Most of my school is full of Twilight haters and I crack up ever time they say something about it.|`|FNwYzjogaa	Yes. I laugh at myself all the time.     If you like I have bad temper tantrums then you have clearly never seen a four year old girl throw a fit.|`|a950da063e9c670dfa13b1fd89d288ddaa	Whatever.|`|L1KVUIJ6aa	the reason why i hate twilight is because you guys wont shut up, i didnt hate it in till the 20 millionth time i was told it was better than jesus himself! i dont get that angry either, but please just stop saying its so great. i was gonna read it but now its such a fad that half the people who worship it havent even read it! so if ur gonna say that us haters have bad temper tantrums, then imagine that something u thought was mediocre was every where u look!

mb1CZfuEaa	lyrical is a combination of ballet and jazz its slower and more expressive but uses lots of turns and leaps. you dance to the lyrics, not counts like ballet and jazz. modern is more free and usually faster than lyrical its not as expressive and can be darker in a sense|`|GLS7vgAdaa	I've always been taught that lyrical and modern are different types of ballet. Lyrical focuses on slow, sustained movement that requires a great deal of control. It's expressive but not to the extreme, at least from my experience. Modern, on the other hand is very free. It's expressive as well but focuses oftentimes more on literal interpretation. I guess you can say that Modern has more of an artistic range to it. anything goes.|`|uHSBIdB1aa	Well lyrical is a form of jazz but slower.  Modern and Lyrical are about the same but have different things about them.  With lyrical you can really show your emotions with the music.  I haven't taken modern, but I take lyrical once a week.  Lots of people I talk to who have taken modern, say that they're different.  I hoped I helped!  good luck!|`|exf4OhPkaa	Lyrical is kinda a combination of jazz and ballet!!

The last paragraphy i basically left the same because i felt it was deep even though it ryhmed alot. Good luck    To Remember,  Tears of Crying  Times I lied  The Memories of  We sanged  She Ran  The Feeling I felt    To Remember,  Wishing of Wealth  Thoughts of Leaving  Within To strong to grieve  Keeping it all in  Yes i have sinned  Putting to and end  How people view  How people see me  Never wanting to be me    To Remember,  Chances I have missed  Things i have wished  I remember never being there  Feelings I was scared to share  I remember taking the road less traveled   My life that unraveled  Some of these things I'll miss  Others I hope to forget

I see why you put this under theatre and acting!|`|co6itGOGaa	well first you cant always point fingers at a guy when you see him with a girl. im assuming that he has some chick friends since he hangs out with you. anyways, if he hasn't responded to you by now and its been 2 days he probably doesn't feel the same way about you.     im sorry to say this and i know having feelings sucks sometimes but he probably doesn't like you the way you like him. just dint pressure him and try to force out answers about how he feels because usually all guys have a hard time expresses themselves.     if you have any other friends i suggest hanging out with them for a little while and letting him off your mind.. just shrug it off..it's not that big of a deal and if he still calls you at night and wants to talk don't start a fight, just say you're busy and cant talk now..|`|d86b2f03db6baf10abae1a77da9c0cb8aa	Don't do drama or you will push him away faster.

It makes me want to know more about this girl with red eyes.|`|daFmqiIIaa	Its pretty good, but why do you switch from 1st to 3rd person halfway through??  i liked it better in 1st person.|`|2QPUs8lBaa	1) Watch your tenses. You are switiching from past to present tense from time to time in the story.     2) You are also switching POV's at the end. Throught the story you are using first person point of view, then near the end you switched to third person.     3) Many of your sentences are short and choppy. You are lacking some details that would be nice to include in your story. Make your story appeal to the senses so your reader can be sucked into the story and feel like they are actually in the story. Include details, but don't overdo it.    4) So far, it seems like your plot is going the way of being about vampires. make sure you dont copy things from other books you have read, such as twilight. vampire books are very overdone right now - make sure you add plenty of twists if you are doing that kind of story.    overall, your writing has alot of room to improve. keep practicing every night, and challenge yourself by reading books that are past your reading level. good luck with your story!|`|P9xcHXryaa	i think it was great, you did switch from 1st to 3rd, but hey, even the best writers get bored with the pov or just get confused...i do both! i loved it though, you should definently publish it!|`|ZC4ZNVzGaa	You posted this before, because I answered it. Did you not read the answers you got? I know there were very few, but they made you aware that your point of views switched mid story. You could of fixed that before you re posted. But like I said before, it sounds a bit cliche (recurring dream, "dark dreary forest", the girl's "beautiful sea blue" eyes going "deadly gleaming bright red", etc.) , but your style is good and it has potential so I think with a little editing (some of the description is a bit of an overkill. Tone it down a bit. "beautiful sea blue eyes" and just as easily be "beautiful dark blue eyes" and still sound nice)and then rewrite and you could have a good story.

sYyNyjwuaa	white, a tinyyyy bit of red, yellow and a hint of brown    more white than anything else, use the brown to vary the darkness of the cream|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Oooh! I generally use white with a touch of yellow ochre. I guess try a touch of the warm yellow with a touch of the raw sienna. That is as close as I can think of. The lemon yellow has a tendency to go green.

rVhrVyRGaa	I agree with Wendy, but in my case, I got very upset with my cousin when my grandfather was dying. He told me that grandchildren were not close enough relatives to get into the intensive care unit to see  him (but somehow my cousin managed to do so), so I never got to tell my grandfather good-bye.     If you are the only living relative, then you ARE the next of kin.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	next of kin means the CLOSEST living relative.    If grandma dies and she has a child living, the child is the next of kin (unless she has a spouse). If NONE of the other close relatives are still alive, and the only relative is the grandchild, then he/she becomes next of kin.
LAPn0BdLaa	I think you underestimate people's intentions. Yes, there is no such thing as "true" altruism, but that doesn't mean there is no such thing as a good person. You could argue that the great things Mother Theresa did were done in part for her own self-fulfillment, but that doesn't mean she wasn't a saint.     And I hate to break to you, but being a philosophy major and taking a few psych classes doesn't make you an expert on the subject lol.|`|i6d582PFaa	no such thing as 100 percent altruism because it always feels good to help people (thus, egoism). And even if you regret the decision you are admitting you egotistically would have rather helped yourself instead.    It's impossible to escape self-interest even if you try to be altruistic, you would simply be following your own principles of altruism, or in other words, your own self-interests.|`|7M3JTnbxaa	Take a psych class and you will find that altrusim is in fact not a myth. for example, there is a type of squirrel that, when in a group and one senses there is danger (such as a predator) near, will let out a loud screech so as to warn the other squirrels. By doing this, it almost ensures its own death, but warns the others and increases their chances of survival.    So, is this a bad thing? Maybe. For that squirrel it is, anyway. But the reason it does this (although it doesn't realize this of course) is to make it more likely that the species will continue to reproduce and grow.    Humans practice altruistic behaviors all the time.|`|trMsK86jaa	Altruism taken as a consideration cannot be considered a good thing.    Altruism is an Act, not a Thought.|`|AA12257113	You are quite right, but do not forget that while we were evolving we made certain that our off spring also survived.    While that is not altruism, it is to say that we do things for others.    Altruism is not evil or bad; it is a goal.    You are quite wrong to say that we do not roam in packs.     While we are not squirrels, human beings form gangs.  Human beings form cliques.  Human beings define themselves by the 'pack' that they belong to.  Think religion, neighborhood, ethnicity, politics, etc.    I don't know s..t from shinola about Wikipedia but I do know that everything we do is for our survival and that sometimes we are able to see something better than just our survival.    I have six children and fourteen grandchildren.  Believe me, there is something better than just taking care of number one.  I want to live as long as I can, but if somebody tried to hurt any of mine I would give up my life to defend them.    And that is not altruisim either; it is selfish.|`|2Ko12Elfaa	(Sigh).  Tired of disputing this.  If there's one thing I've learned from this website, it's that the type of people that are so quick to attach themselves to the idea of altruism as a myth are unwilling to consider alternative views - even when they are stated with valid logic.  So, in short: NOT PHILOSOPHY.  Philosophy will not come from this question.|`|ouWBVQJ2aa	i don't know|`|EO35f6yhaa	I don't have an answer, for you, alas, but here's some people who might. Also, do check out the 1971 Trivers paper on reciprocal altruism. You know, the one Dawkins keeps alluding to in Selfish Gene.|`|eQd4veAdaa	"altruism is a myth"    No. Altruism means behaviour that does not benefit the person performing it, but helps others. Millions of examples of altruism are observable every day.    "humans evolved by caring only about themselves and their survival and health"    Not true. Humans, like other species, evolved by caring for themselves, their families, and other human beings in general. This is what good evolutionary biology teaches us; see, for example, Richard Dawkins's "Nice Guys Finish First".    Co-operation is integral to our way of thinking. I do not know why people perform altruistic behaviours because I cannot see inside their heads. I cannot even see inside my own head. Human minds are mysterious. Behaviour, though, is evident, and altruistic behaviour is an undeniable fact.|`|ql4EgAL3aa	There is scientific evidence that there is altruism. Altruism evolves from fertility, males look for females with nurturing qualities.     Evolutionary theory predicts competition between individuals and yet we see many examples in nature of individuals disadvantaging themselves to help others. In humans, particularly, we see individuals prepared to put themselves at considerable risk to help individuals they do not know for no obvious reward.    check out this great article:     http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/200...|`|j1iRQp6faa	hmmm...that's a very good question.  But being a "dork" generally a bad thing?
e607de785f45933493ee1b1163bf88d9aa	Ernest Clifford Miller[1] (born January 14, 1964) is an American actor and former professional wrestler who worked for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) better known by his ring name Ernest "The Cat" Miller.|`|801zLB53aa	I don't know if this will help you, but it has helped me a lot in the past when I just needed an idea.  I go into the "images" area of a domain, like Yahoo or Google.   It shows you photos or whatever that other people have taken or are professional photos, etc.   You CANNOT use these exact photos for copyright reasons, but they might give you SOMETHING that could be drawn or something.  Just go to Google.com (or Yahoo.com) and type in Arthur Miller and then click on Images.  Give it a shot.  You might find inspiration there.  But again, those images are mostly proprietary and cannot be used as they are and you could be sued if you copy them.  They just MIGHT jog your creative juices and help you.  Good luck.
8cuPVvYnaa	Pilgrims progress by paul bunyun    Sorry, I mean John Bunyun|`|N8HgRKnfaa	It sounds like the classic PILGRIMS PROGRESS by John Bunyan. It is an allegory of the Christian life written sometime in the 1600s ( I believe).    The details of the story are not quite what you've mentioned. A man named Christian has the burden on his back (representing his sinful nature) and he is desperate to get rid of it and go to The Celestial City (heaven).    There are modern versions of this book, but I think the original is so much better and really not that hard to read.    It's a fascinating story, one that all Christians should read if they can.    EDIT: lol, Charli (above), not PAUL Bunyan.  He's the giant lumberjack with the giant Babe, the blue ox. It's JOHN  Bunyan
h3gMzNS3aa	Because you've put them in a state of suffering. It doesn't matter that their suffering is misguided, you're still the catalyst for someone else experiencing negative forms of consciousness which result in suffering.<br>  <br>  A girl on Jerry Springer was crying her eyes out because her mother wouldn't accept her marrying a man from another race; it's irrelevant that the mother was in the wrong, the girl doesn't like to be a cause for her mother's disappointment. Some go to the extreme of actually denying themselves freedom so that they can prevent causing these feelings to come up in others, but then it's a completely different sting of entrapment.|`|2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	What it is about is your parent's or other's expectations of you, and telling them the truth means you are telling them something that  is in opposition to what they think about you.  As children and young adults our behavior is very much dictated by the family unit and the parents rule over how that behavior is carried out.  We all start to develop our own desires, interests and personalities in spite of this 'control' - that's often when parents and kids start fighting.  Once we are out living on our own, living our lives the way we prefer, and following our own interests without that control, interesting things can happen.  And what comes from that is fear that our parents or others won't be happy with what we've done so we try to hide it.  It really is all about the dynamic that is created within relationships.  And it's also about changing - we need to be true to ourselves and sometimes that is hard when others have a strong influence over our lives.|`|b9e17f1222430e55dd4de26ca13cde6caa	We depend a lot on other opinions of us to gauge our own self worth. When we respect a certain person or persons or have spent a great deal of our lives interacting with them, we use their perceptions to rank our place in the world. If your parents love you, you have a higher rank in their world, feel better about yourself for being the type of person they can love, and present yourself that way. When something in our lives offers a difference that is  outside the norm for our friends or loved ones, they reject it, more out of fear than anything else. For example, logically if you believe that homosexuality is nothing more than an immoral choice, and the one who is involved needs to be redirected, you draw them into the fold, support and comfort them, offer to help them redirect their energies and if you truly want to help them, you love them even more than before (it is their refusal to do just that which puts these fundamentalists in the awkward position of reinforcing the idea that you don't choose to be gay).|`|A01w1dHqaa	We put our self-worth in the hands of others of the world. But hurt is only of the ego. When we realize God loves us no matter what, and that's enough, we can do anything that comes from God and realize others will eventually understand. Down deep they really do love us, anyway.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Sting them, or sting you?<br>  <br>  It stings you to think that they only care about a false picture of you, and that when they know the real you they won't like you as much.<br>  <br>  It also forces you to confront that your loved ones may be somewhat narrow-minded or judgmental, especially when you are able to see their flaws but they aren't.|`|gUCjkj9oaa	well everyone wants the world to be as they see fit,anything else is just plain unacceptable.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Don't worry, it is only a temporary sting. Delusions spring eternal in the benighted mind of a lover.

There is In The Forest of The Night, Demon In My View, Shattered Mirror, Midnight Predator. And then there is the The Kiesha'ra series: Hawksong, Snakecharm, Falcondance, Wolfcry and Wyverhail.

It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too. So yeah.. you should check it out
OjQxKGC0aa	Of course they are science fiction. They deal with answering the question "What if?" in relation to science. For example, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" asks what happens when androids are like us. At that point we need to ask what it means to be human. Could androids be more human than the people who created them?     Good science fiction has always been about the impact science has on people, and Dick's work is science fiction at its best. I like that it comes close to answering the questions, but in the end leaves that up to the reader. A good science fiction story should leave you with questions, not answers. It should make you think.|`|6ypXRuIEaa	Yes they are. His stories deal with futuristic events that may one day become posssible.  http://www.philipkdick.com/aa_biography....

inwjd6Tmaa	It's alright. I always cry when sad things happen; but to answer your question I believe he did go Strigoi. Mason wouldn't lie to Rose like that, because I'm pretty sure he wants her to be happy. He wouldn't lie about something like that to her, considering how much pain she went through because of his death. & Mason made it clear that he didn't come back to haunt her or get revenge.    But I have hope that something will happen. Something good. We won't know until the next book comes out. keep your fingers crossed. :]|`|Mr6loullaa	Well I think that Mason was telling the truth...Mason is dead and there is no reason for him to lie now..after all he won't be able to be with her now that she is dead.

Mason understands Dimitri and Rose, and knows that he himself is moving on. All he would want is for Rose to know the truth, for the truth can be the most powerful sign of love at times. Mason did what he thought was best for Rose.|`|6TPEyJqhaa	Sry, but I think he really did get turn into a Strigoi.  I don't think that that will be the end of it though.  We'll just have to wait and see cuz' I don't think that the story will end there.

They know plenty about that issue because they help kids with these occupation dessicions all of the time.     :) hope that helps.|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	Go to college for communications. You can't go to law school until you get an undergraduate degree, so go with the communications, and see if you like it.    But as a warning, you don't just become an editor. You work your butt off, starting at the lowest of the low.
8yE2sYGeaa	The death penalty does not really deter crime. Sure, THAT person won't kill again, but people are killed every day, so no one is afraid of it.|`|94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	There is no prosecutor, judge, jurist, warden, or hangman that can give life to a dead body. Not if it was dead for ten seconds, ten minutes, ten hours, ten days, or ten weeks or ten months or ten years.   If they don't have the power to give life to a dead body then they don't have the right to take it away. State sanctioned or not they simply don't have the right. Legal and moral are two different things here and to rely on legalities is giving allowance to the Nazi's for their atrocities. After all, what they did under their own laws were legal for the most part regardless of how they wrestled the power from the people. They legalized their actions.  To kill a murderer may seem justified but then we are lowering ourselves to the level of the murderer and stealing the opportunity for him/her to give themselves up to our God. Now He has the right to kill anyone He wants, He alone can raise the dead, He can raise the dead from a field of a thousand bones if He so chooses. A mere man cannot, and if we kill an innocent man for the sake of justice then when he is proved innocent after his death? Who here can raise him up from the grave and give him his life back?   Keep the convicted alive. Keep them imprisoned and alive and should their innocence be found we can dignify our response with the release of the prisoner ... alive.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I don't believe in the death penalty but, I also believe that these killers should be out of the way of civilized people without the help of the taxpayer. Like an large island off the coast somewhere that's left to them and they are under watch, they can farm for their food and eat their own produce. they can live their lives as they want.|`|i6d582PFaa	it's hypocritical    "You killed someone, that's bad, so we'll kill you."|`|Ed8BbSzeaa	Alright, so say a guy is charged for a terrible crime and is sentenced the death penalty...

If someone killed my mother I would want to kill them. Society has to protect itself in my mind. Sad but true.|`|WvfTOjRFaa	killing is never right under any circumstances. A death penalty is being imposed on a criminal, but what about those children and innocent people killed in a war? is that forgivable or acceptable under such circumstances? is there a law who could protect the victims?|`|4aa8824c12babfd0fa8da8f2f1cf115faa	Life in prison is so much better.  Rather than kill a person for a capital crime, it's better to deprive him of every other human right such as freedom, privacy, and speech for 30-50 years until he either dies an early "natural" death, is killed by inmates, or commits suicide as a result of the deprivation of any normal form of humanity.  And assure that this is the case, by providing only a small percentage of appeals and legal representation that those subject to the cruel death penalty receive.  Top it off by subjecting the bad girl/guy to sexual molestation, prison gang rule, and an 8 x 10 house for 50 years, and life in prison is so much better than the death penalty.    Be sure to send a copy of your presentation to the families of the teenagers that were killed by the last guy executed in California.  You know, the kids who died after a "lifer" (commuted from the death penalty once before) contracted someone to kill the witnesses to his crimes from his prison cell, but killed three innocent adolescent teenagers instead.  I'm sure their parents will appreciate your presentation that the death penalty was the wrong decision for their childrens' killers.|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	Right, I do not support death penalty either.     Even a serial killer should have the right to undergo psychological treatment if possible as nobody goes around killing others without a reason. Beneath the reason would almost definitely be a hurt the serial killer have been through in the past which caused him or her to resort to violence.     "the old dog" is right. Death penalty may seem justified but you are lowering yourself to the level of the killer. It actually boils down to a person's belief. You can only choose justice or mercy, not both.

Poems are many times simple but in order to really understand things have to unfold. I've read some of your other poems on yahoo answers and quite frankly i think you may be in 5'th grade. I'm not saying a 5'th grader can not make a wonderful poem because i was in 5'th grade when i got my first poem published but you really should try thinking outside the box. Outside boys. outside Love. Something that's more true than love. Something more true than boys. something that, 50 years from now, someone will look back upon your poem and really think "This person has changed my life". You have skills in you, you just need to look deeper and find that beat, you'll see it and really notice a difference.! Keep writing. it's good for you!~|`|HqWPJXlRaa	I don't mean to be rude, but your poem is grade 4 level.  Very plain and simple.  The word hate is very strong too.

But it is a good expression. Peace.|`|wLFsuMPBaa	negative: too dramatic  positive: but still shows true love|`|6hqmRRzHaa	its not terrible... but i dont think its great. It doesn't really flow. And the repetition of the word blood is unsatisfying. Its a short poem so repetition isn't hard to fix. Also, word choice could be sooped up a bit. instead of save, rescue... little stuff like that makes it tons better when you've only got a few lines to work with ... and at the very end you switch from first person, to third, back to first and that didn't seem like you meant for it to be that way. I think you just gotta fix the last stanza... Because that's the "heart" of the whole poem... (no pun intended)  It's what shows that the girl still has love for the boy and it should really stand out from the rest of the poem and not just wheeze out like it is. But overall... its good, better than most, but not great. Just make it better, even though i may sound harsh or other people might too, just make it better.|`|MKSjVt4Faa	i like it|`|Gj7xt64Vaa	good poem...  but in such a way it's sort of an emo poem?

In 1940, Avraham Stern, one of the most extreme of the jewish terrorists approached the German Naval Attache in Ankara with an offer to fight the British in Palestine if Hitler would guarantee a totalitarian Jewish State in Palestine after the war.  His offer was turned down and he was killed in a shoot out with the British in 1942.  Google Stern Gang, LEHI  Iran was nominally neutral but was occupied by the British and the Russians.

Germany|`|NknkzKAdaa	Here are the top ten:    1 - Jesus Christ (Founder of Christianity, which has shaped the world,  a worldwide religion that has influenced the world for over 2000 years. His philosophy of love and acceptance was radically new in a world that frequently feared God. Jesus made God approachable. "Love thy neighbor as yourself" was a moral philosophy that preached equal acceptance for all. Jesus is credited with addressing the hypocrisy that existed within the early Common Era Jewish leadership, where attention to the rule of law had often superceded intention. )  2 - Abraham (Basiclly started the war between Jews and Arabs by giving birth to Ishmael and Isaac)  3 - Alexander the Great (Brought Greek culture to many other places)  4 - Genghis Khan (The Mongols changed much of Asia)  5 - Sun Tzu (revolutionised warfare)  6 - Karl Marx (Started the idea of Communism which spread)  7 - Hitler (Started WWII and changed warfare technology, making technology important in war)  8 - Muhammad Founder of the Islamic faith, but also a military and political leader. Mohammed revised the social, economic and political life of a large area of the Middle East and North Africa, eliminating practices like female infanticide, and creating new rights to property and autonomy for women. He received and transmitted the Koran, the holy book of Islam. Muslims view him not as the creator of a new religion, but as the restorer of the original, uncorrupted monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, and others. He was influential in setting up the just society that would be moral in the eyes of Allah (Arabic for the God).   9 - Isaac Newton Scientist who summarized all of the findings of all great scientists before him, such as Galileo, Copernicus, Kepler, and Tyco Brahe. The author of the revolutionary work, Principia, he is also credited with developing differential calculus. In addition, he wrote about optics and gravitation. Newton's "clockwork" metaphor of the universe influenced science for over 200 years. As the Master of the Mint (Secretary of Treasury) in England, he set in motion how capitalism was to operate at the national level.   10 - Einstein - Developer of the theories of special and general relativity, which changed the way scientists see our world. In 1950 he published five landmark scientific papers, any one of which would have been considered an astounding work of original science. Together, they represented a whole new view of the universe, physics and mathematics. He also had a hand in creating the science of quantum mechanics.

Everybody has their own "taste" in books.    I am currently reading the Hunger Games. Steph. Meyer recommended it on her website. She said it was very good. I do like the book, although I cannot put so many comments on the book because I am only on page 16.     I suggest that if you LOVE Twilight so much (I     If you love to read about vampires so much, go to Barnes&Nobles website and search "vampires". But, be aware, the vampire books are mostly teen books or not as good as Twilight. :]    I hoped I helped out a little bit! :]|`|6Gt0OVA9aa	twilight sucks|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  This is an extremely good book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.    I've read twilight and loved it but i thought these books were almost as good or even better.    Other books I've heard were good and planning to read is Need by Carrie Jones, Evernight by Claudia Gray, Lament by Maggie Stiefvater, Beastley by Alex Flinn, Old Magic by Marianne Curley, Elsewhere by Gabrielle Zevin, the Blue is for Nightmares series by Laurie Stolarz, and Evermore by Alyson Noel (coming out in February)    I recommend Need by Carrie Jones if you really liked Twilight. I heard it was really similar but with werewolves instead of vampires and more. Some people told me they liked it better than Twilight too. So yeah.. you should check it out|`|4kHH2U6Iaa	Blue blood series by Melissa de la Cruz  it's also about vampires,but not at all like the Twilight series.|`|uh2Y3CR8aa	Hey the Host by Steph.

UKB0u0fPaa	well... this specific part of the novel takes place i believe in the later fall or early january february months not to sure on the year, (i would go with the publishing year (08). Takes place in Forks, Washington , Island off of the coast of Brazil (non existent ), Atmosphere changes a lot in this book it goes from lovey dovey romantic and sweet to adrenaline filled and intense to suspensful. When it's suspensful (waiting for the volturi to make a decision, when the witnesses are listening to Garrett's speech) tense (when Leah Jacob and Seth leave the other pack) humorous (whenever Edward talks to Rosalie in a mean way or when Garret says to Kate "i'd follow you all over the world woman" and she says "oh now you tell me".)     needing more detail means you didn't quite grasp the full concept of the book you should have been able to come up with these answers by yourself after the first read, i've only read it once and that was almost 4 months ago and i pulled out all those answers....|`|FLfmkNEAaa	NO|`|4FqP313qaa	it takes place in 2008. pretty much prestn time..=] in forks, whashington on the olympic penninsula.   it was pretty intense when bella was becoming a vamp, during the painful transformation. also when renesmee was being born and bella almost died.  you also might consider actually reading the book for your report. that tends to help, just a little bit.

mnIeK8q6aa	4) Make sure to get what Pompey and Crassus wanted.     Pompey wanted land for his troops to retire on.  Crassus wanted to have the state contracts over Asia re-issued.   Both issues were vetoed by the Optimates - the ultra conservatives who controlled the senate.     That was the whole reason for the first triumvirate: to get what each wanted together. In the first triumvirate Caesar was the junior partner.     3) Is wrong. Cesar never intended overthrow the government. Certainly not during his first consulship.|`|xFg8mQeCaa	The First Triumvirate in this period  The First Triumvirate was formed in 60 BC by Pompey, Caesar and Crassus. It was a political coalition but a secret arrangement between three men who were never officially recognized as triumvirs. It was cemented by political marriages (Pompey married Caesars daughter Julia). It was to operate for five years and all three participants would gain from the coalition. The First Triumvirate was opposed by the Senate under the leadership of Cato [1]. It was not an easy coalition but rather, one which suffered many hiccups resulting in a renewal of the agreement at Luca in 56 BC. However, with the death of Julia in 54 BC and Crassus in 53 BC, the agreement began to falter. The First Triumvirate ended in 53 BC, resulting in civil war between Pompey and Caesar

xFg8mQeCaa	features that protected the people inside.     First, the castle's walls were thick. This made the walls difficult to knock down (or in).     Some castles are known as concentric castles. Concentric castles were surrounded by several walls. These extra walls provided better protection against attackers.     So, the castle walls are the first way to defend your castle (castle defend technique  1).     Many medieval castles were crenellated at the top. Crenallated means they had parts that stuck up like teeth.     In times of battle, archers (an important class of the castle defenders) hid behind the higher parts (merlons) and shot arrows through the openings (crenels).     Archers also fired arrows through arrowloops. Arrowloops were narrow slits or cross-shaped openings in the wall.     Crenels, merlons, arrowloops, and archers combine to provide the second way to defend your castle (castle defend technique  2).     Some castles had parts of walls that stuck out further than the rest. These extruding parts of the walls are called machicolations.     In battle, castle soldiers dropped boiling water or rocks on their attackers through holes in the machicolation's floor. Interestingly, these holes were actually called murder holes!     Murder holes are the third way to defend your castle (castle defend technique  3).     Another architectural defense used in some castles was called the talus. A talus was a lower section of a castle's walls that had an outward slope. The idea was that rocks would bounce off a talus back toward the enemy.     The talus is another way to defend your castle (castle defend technique  4).     The castle's main entrance was often placed on the other side of a gatehouse. In front of the gate attackers would find a heavy iron gate, called a portcullis. Defenders lowered the portcullis with chains and pulleys when they were under attack.     The gatehouse and portcullis provide yet another way to defend your castle (castle defend technique  5).     On the sides of the gatehouse towers would often be built. The stairways in these towers always curved to the right so that knights coming down the stairs had room to swing their swords. Now that is a fine example of "planning ahead"! ;)     Many of the major castles were surrounded by a moat. A moat was a deep ditch that was often filled with water. A drawbridge led across the moat to the gatehouse. In times of war, the castle defenders pulled up the drawbridge to close off this entrance to the castle.     The towers and moat offer more ways to defend your castle (castle defend techniques  6, and 7).     Sometimes, these castles contained secret passages. In times of siege these secret passages could be used to hide provisions as well as people. In a few rare cases the passages provided a means of escaping from the castle undetected! Even this can be considered as another castle defend technique.     A&E provides a fascinating home video on these secret passages. If you are interested in learning more I recommend watching it some weekend.     As you can see, great thought went into the architectural design to defend these castles and as a result the design itself provided many interesting castle defend techniques.|`|bT0WNmkraa	bartizan

83zdE9rTaa	Philosophy means "love of knowledge".  Philosophers are those of us who try to deduce principles from our experiences in hopes that we can better understand and deal with  new experiences that are somewhat similar. Most everyone is a philosopher to some degree.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Philosophy, unlike science, does not have a set of strictures and observational practices that enforce uniformity. Often what appears to be a set of theories both holistic and specific to the creator of a philosophy, can be seen as slip-shod, faulty and downright dishonest to another observer. So aside form any ACTUAL shortcuts philosophers use to come up with their ideas, the contentiousness of rival philosophies create a bad atmosphere fro civil debate.    But it is nothing compared to religious disagreement, and if you want a real nest of scoundrels, try politicians.    Compared to politics, philosophy is a science.|`|1l69CCScaa	There are people guilty of dishonesty and a lack of intellectual conscience (and lying!) in every field of study.

In philosophy, all sound arguments can be evaluated by anyone (even the layman) and other than in certain fields of philosophy philosophers have no "evidence" to be honest to.  Philosophy is a thinkers field, and nothing is to be gained by lying.|`|trMsK86jaa	I would suggest that perhaps we all are, to a certain degree.|`|3tnVVFjHaa	thats the whole world my dear.almost.|`|medlUh0maa	First of all, dishonesty and lying are pretty much the same thing...    All philosophers are guilty of all those things because they are all human.  Every human has been guilty of lying and having lack of intellectual conscience at one point or another; some more than others.  This really isn't that pertinent to Philosophers because all philosophies are just the opinions of individuals on how everyone should go about living their life.  One can either agree with their opinions or not.|`|6sRTsbfVaa	crakers|`|6abb0d6590cdc272570c33416665d522aa	bla bla bla.   All philosophers are whatever....lame!|`|GWCMQUnIaa	About to apply to the university course known as Philosophy.   When you say things like that, it makes me want to be a Philosopher more, in order to enlighten one more of what exactly the world is enduring. A love of knowledge is not the only characteristic that a Philosopher owns, as you have mentioned.  The reason to why Philosophy differs to science, which is what most believe tend to believe, cause hard proof seems to be more efficient that hard belief.   You cannot accuse a Philosopher of  lying or being dishonest when an answer does not exist, can you prove the meaning of life, and tell them they are lying.  Can you answer whether God exists, and if so why he hasn't told us the things we nee dot know in order to succeed completely(don't get me wrong I believe in god).  Philosophers are the top of the hierarchy when it comes to intelligence, to say they have a lack of intellectual conscience is entirely wrong, they are basically people trying to achieve somethings that cannot be achieved and they should be praised not judged.

bbpS3n9Waa	Hmm... I got it the other way around. Elizabeth's personal prejudice against Darcy prevented her from seeing his good side, and his pride prevented him from showing it to her. Until, of course, they got over it. I don't remember anything about Elizabeth not admitting her love for Darcy out of pride, just that she hated him for a long time and once she fell in love it took her a while to realize it. Darcy was the one who wouldn't admit his own feelings to himself - and yes, he did have a bit of class prejudice, but that didn't seem to be the main source of conflict. Well, anyway, you can see both in both characters, but that's my opinion on which dominates which.    Oh, and it is possible to read too much into the title - Austen meant to call it First Impressions, but another book with that title came out first, so it was changed to something in the style of her successful first book, Sense and Sensibility.|`|vFFgHI9Kaa	In basic terms...    elizabeth has all the pride (will not admit her feelings for darcy)  and he has all the prejudice (looks down on her for being 'poor')    however they overcome these things to fall in love. Of course the explanation goes a lot deeper than that but there is your quick answer.    wikipedia has a good explanantion of it also.

Pq8gQsl2aa	Stephenie only wrote Twilight because one of the scenes from the book was actually a dream she has. So a dream about a vampire and a girl being in love was what started the Twilight book.   And yes, there had to be vampires because that was what was in her dream and that's how she wanted to write it.    No she didn't do research, it's fantasy and FICTION. It's fake. People can make up whatever they want to.|`|0WKkXIyKaa	in the book the vampires all ways say .. stake in the heart is so your typical vampire. but that doesnt exsist.  but they sparkle .. wtf ? wouldnt bella and edward also have used some kind of contracception aswell ?       http://www.cracked.com/article_16878_if-...    this is v funny.|`|oHL8qA42aa	okay, that is kinda the WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY. and its kinda hard to learn about something that doesnt exsist.|`|3Nr9o9UDaa	because of her dream thats how twilight got started from a dream  go on her website and click twilight  and its not that she didnt do research its that she wrote about her own interpretation of what she thinks vamps should be like and i think she did an awsome job|`|QMYNDtHgaa	100 year old men who are waiting for the perfect woman don't exist in real life.  Also don't have super powers.  A love story between two ordinary High school kids...yah that's best seller.  seriously?      Stephenie Meyers did more research on writing a love story then on vampires.  I think if she would have done any research on Vampires she would have came up with the same outcome because vampire stories are usually extremely violent and sexual.  Not the book she was trying to write at all.  Breaking Dawn resembles a disturbed vampire story more then the others and is the least favorite.  She should have research the La Chubacabra because I think the world is long past due for a La Chubacabra love story.      What do you want from this NY Times best seller?  You can't possibly say someone who turned a mundane love story into a phenomenon messed up on a story.|`|KxdDeO8Taa	Because it would be boring. Adding a vampire makes it unique and original. Plus, adds a lot of suspense 2 the story|`|jHDxMlhEaa	there are many different kinda of vampires so she may have done research on a certain type. which is obviously not the Stereo types.

HkXYGAOdaa	Germany refused to sign the Treaty.<br>  <br>  Because Germany was not allowed to take part in the negotiations, the German government issued a protest against what it considered to be unfair demands, and a "violation of honour" and soon afterwards, withdrew from the proceedings of the Treaty of Versailles. <br>  <br>  Germany's first democratically elected Chancellor, Philipp Scheidemann refused to sign the treaty and resigned. In a passionate speech before the National Assembly on 12 March 1919, he called the treaty a "murderous plan."<br>  <br>  He exclaimed, "Which hand, trying to put us in chains like these, would not wither? The treaty is unacceptable."|`|gGZz2EGyaa	I am not sure of the names of the people you want but I have found a web site that has all the information about the Treaty of Versailles.  Hope it is of some help to you.|`|pI5jKfmaaa	The Treaty of Versailles was one of the peace treaties at the end of World War I. It ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, one of the events that triggered the start of the war. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I were dealt with in separate treaties. Although the armistice signed on 11 November 1918 ended the actual fighting, it took six months of negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. Of the many provisions in the treaty, one of the most important and controversial required Germany and its allies to accept responsibility for causing the war and, under the terms of articles 231-248, to disarm, make substantial territorial concessions and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. The Treaty was undermined by subsequent events starting as early as 1922 and was widely flouted by the mid-thirties.[1]|`|IgEYfBPJaa	no germany didn't sign, atleast i don't think so :/ <br>  i think they just left germany out|`|ZDrXFS2daa	Vittorio Orlando from Italy also.<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/versailles.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/versa...</a>

HkXYGAOdaa	I had a very serious operation with a 25% chance of survival, 25% chance of nerve immobilization, and 50% chance of death.  I came through it, and it happened many years ago.  It did not require any courage on my part.  But my then husband hung pictures of my loved ones especially my adorable nephews whom I love very much, on the walls of my hospital room.  I sometimes thinks it was love that pulled me through, and absolutely no courage on my part.<br>  <br>  Very interesting question.|`|iP863XM6aa	Well, its nothing big like a hold up or almost plane crash lol<br>  But  my most dangerous situation was:<br>  I was driving home late one night coming back from a friends house. Anyways, i live in a small town and occasionally, you will see an animal crossing the road, big or small.. we've seen it almost all. (horses, moose, deer, dog, cat, you name it..). Anyways, it was really dark and the power was out so there were not street lights, house lights or anything to light up the road i was on except for my car lights (which btw, sucked at the time... one of them had burned out the week before and i hadnt had the chance to go switch it yet). It was around one in the morning, and i just looked away from the road for not even 3 seconds and when i looked back at the road, there was a moose id say not even 2 meters infront of the car and i was heading straight for it. (if you've never seen a moose, they are huge and if you hit them with a small car, your chances of surviving the crash are very slim). Anyways, i had to think fast. So i hit the brakes hard and spun the wheel. My car started doing donughts for i dont know how long and next thing i noticed i was heading straight for a tree. So once again, i spun the wheel hoping to stay on the road. The car did more doghnuts but finally came to a complete stop in the middle of road facing the way i had come from. <br>  After all that was done, i looked around and obviously, the moose had gone back to the woods and its only then that my body started shaking uncontrolably because of the adrenaline rush. Its weird because the whole time, its as if my brain was processing what was going on at a million miles an hour and thinking about solutions about what to do next instead of freaking out like most people would. When i was heading for the moose, my thought was : my dad will kill me if i crash his car so i spun the wheel to avoid it. When i was going for the tree, i thought : well, thats not better than a moose and spun the wheel again. Finally, when i manage to stop the car, i started laughing at the fact that what kept me from crashing was the fact that i was afraid for the car, not my life :p <br>  But, i had to stay parked on the side of the road for at least half an hour after because my body was shaking so hard i couldnt hold on to the wheel or keep my foot on the gas.<br>  <br>  Thats my "dangerous" story :p|`|UuQAPHJtaa	"Only stories where you came out alive please.

No remarkable courage, but a true story.|`|dpuY0jWiaa	When I was a teenager, my family lived on the edge of a Great Lakes city. Our back yard ended with a break-wall along a large and deep lake. We had a great family pet, a foxhound named Tramp. One late winter afternoon I returned home looking to take the dog for a walk. He loved to run in the fields across the road and chase pheasants out of the hedgerows. Not finding him inside, I ventured out to the backyard. All I could see were his pawprints in the snow leading to the break-wall, and from there on to the ice-covered lake.Then my blood turned cold; quite a distance offshore his tracks ended in a ragged black hole in the ice. Scaling a fence and racing to the next door neighbours' dock to get closer, I peered out to the hole and saw the tip of Tramp's nose momentarily surface, then disappear. From there it was a blur, but somehow I got out there and with one hand pulled him out by the collar, with ice cracking all around us dragged his limp body back to land, and started pushing in his ribcage and administering a canine version of CPR. Then I carried him, still comatose, inside to blankets and massaging in front of an electric heater. He revived, followed me around constantly for a few days, and went on to live a few more years to the dog-old age of thirteen.|`|N0E6WlDuaa	I was stuck out in the middle of the ocean and an escort boat lost sight of me.

Really, every idea has been thought of before--what makes certian ideas stand out is the way it is written.  Don't fall into the trap of "the main character doesn't want to move" or other things.  One big dramatic knife twist to your manuscript should do the trick.  Just take a little time to free write--let out all of your ideas, rewrite so many scenerios, however insane they may be.  Don't be afraid to take risks with this story, and don't be afraid to do the unexpected.  Otherwise, I think you're onto something =]|`|sxegmou2aa	I think it would be a really good story!!..

de0e13b53b8247e94598d0825137ca7baa	For light, fun fantasy I recommend Patricia C. Wrede: Dealing with Dragons series and Mairelon the Magician.  S.L. Viehl is good, Blade Dancer would be perfect, very sarcastic main character, more science fiction than fantasy but not hard sci-fi, more character driven.  And aliens are like fairy folk in a way. :)  Tamora Pierce definitely, Robin McKinley, Anne McCaffrey, Mercedes Lackey, all great fantasy authors with plenty of books so you won't run out too quickly!  Have fun!|`|QlB3VXWraa	You might like "The Clan of the Cave Bear" by Jean Auel. It's about prehistoric times when there were Neandrathals and modern humans living at the same time.

SbPuLGJNaa	Yes, I agree that you write for yourself because you enjoy it but you also want to share it w/ others.  As a storyteller & writer you want to catch the interest of your readers which out of curiosity you asked this question. I think its lame that people would post how uncreative you are.  I mean you're 13 & its a learning process for you to write and catch the readers attention.  Don't bother w/ their opinions.  Just have fun writing even if it is writing something that someone would like you to write about.  Good luck!    To answer your question..I love horror and fantasy =)  BEST GENRE EVER, my opinion.  So I WANT to read about another world (Fantasy) w/ a scary creatures that rule that realm (Horror).    EDIT:    WOW.  KK i apologize If i offended you.  My  "kiss a*s answer" was my personal opinion & wasn't trying to win points.  You may offer criticism in every question you answer, but it wouldnt hurt to actually answer the question w/o being an a*s. =) Thanks.|`|TlqSAM0naa	I love the Twilight series.      So a book about vampires, in the past [a history sort] in diary form.  There has to be a love story involved, like a girl writing in her diary about how she fell in love with a vampire during the depression or something..    =]    But that would be for like an advanced writer..maybe just a diary of a vampire?|`|LVZdzPmpaa	I would like to read a story about a 13-year old who think she can just sit down and knock out a "book" based on what the peanut gallery on Yahoo Answers tells her. I would like to read about how she lacks creativity of any sort and must rely on others to give her ideas. I would also like the story to detail how it is that a person thinks she can create a readable story when she has no clue about the writing process, much less the creative process. In the end of the story, I would like this 13-year old to discover the realities of a writing life and understand what goes into creating a "book," start to finish. Transformed, the girl would look to herself and learn to think on her own and take on more realistic goals.    The fact that you state that you  "have wrote" concerns me deeply.    And when you want to play with the big dogs, you are not allowed to use the "I'm only 13!" whine card.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	i want to read about:  - fantasy  - horror  - romance    and all in detail.    i don't want to read about:  - school life  - parties  - cliques  - rich brats  - prom  - magic  - mystery  - sci-fi|`|UtzALxfjaa	Romance, with humor. Sadness and regret.|`|YorMkZYAaa	I second what Patti said.    You don't "plan" to write a book, you just do it. Outlines are one thing, actually planning but never sitting down to write is another. Writing isn't about being interested in what others want to read. You don't write for others, you write for yourself and your passion for writing. If you can't sit down and just write for yourself instead of asking questions like these (proving your lack of creativity, knowledge and discipline of writing, and your actual passion for the craft) then you're in no position to write a book.     No writer started out writing books right out of the gate. Each started small and worked their way up. That is what you need to do.

So now in fantasies I would like to see more werewolves (although there are ton, I haven't read a ton.) And faeries, shapeshifters, etc. Although I will continue reading vampire stories once they stop being so cliche.     But you should write in genres that you like to read.|`|1keH3R6paa	I love teen romance/thriller.|`|EHrbDq0naa	How about a little sci-fi?  How fun would it be to have a special Zapper key on your keyboard? You aim your cursor at a particularly mean response to your question and hit the Zapper key and poof!  It's gone!|`|WzIpU0h2aa	This is the kind of book I like to read:  mystery  romance  historical  action  adventure|`|bLnjJ6Cbaa	I want to read about a group of evil fantasy creatures who rule over their realm with fear and the immortal zapper. To suppress their people and control all aspects of life, they use their mighty zapper to get rid of dissenters in their midst. All goes horribly wrong when the zapper falls into the hands of the rebellion, who discover the body-switching button conveniently marked "Danger! Hitting this button may cause serious side effects!" (The villains always seem to forget that they shouldn't mark switches they obviously shouldn't have had in the first place so blatantly) Well, the rebels switch bodies with the evil lords, it's an uphill battle, and the Scrooges of the world are transformed into decent fantasy-creature beings. In the process, the zapper is destroyed, and there is peace on planet Zoltron. Oh -- I almost forgot. There's a romance subplot in their somewhere, between a rebel girl and a zapper-man. Just to appeal to everyone else's tastes on this question.    Either that, or a story with a boy named Ben, his girlfriend Lucy, and Lucy's dog, Chowder. Good luck on your writing!|`|4BKiRwRCaa	about family, friendship, inspirational|`|UN4PGkEbaa	fantasy creatures coming into our modern world! i love fantasy n i love if ppl start writing books w magical creatures like unicorns, elves and a little bit of romance wont hurt bc i luv romances too    btw great answer gemma i dont kno why ppl dont just answer the question its not hard
YorMkZYAaa	I am an adult who uses the F word regularly (often when exclaiming why the heck the idiots who live above me -- and I live alone -- have to be stomping around) and I am neither ignorant nor uneducated. I just have a "colorful' vocabulary if you will. I don't think the occasional swearing makes one ignorant or uneducated. I do, however, think it's narrow-minded to assume one is for the occasional foul word.<br>  <br>  Now, that being said, there is a time and place for everything. Obviously I am not going to stand in line at Starbucks or my grocery store blurting out the F word every five seconds. Nor will I overload writing with excessive swearing.<br>  <br>  When it comes to teen/YA fiction it depends on the context in which it used. If you have say a teenager who might randomly blurt out "What the f*ck?" in dialogue, then fine. If it reads like this:<br>  <br>  "Those f*cking idiots never knew what the f*ck they were doing. I couldn't believe it. To me they were nothing more than dumbf*cks."<br>  <br>  Then it is overdone and will be discarded faster than you CAN say, "What the f*ck?!?"<br>  <br>  Time, place, and context matters.|`|v70p2kgWaa	Yes I do.  I tend to look over $hit and @sshole, even b***h has its odd place in YA fiction.  However f*** does not.  Actually I feel it's insanely overused in a lot of adult stuff too.  Many an amazing story has been completely ruined by that little word.  <br>  <br>  addtional  note<br>  Words aren't just words they convey meaning; that's the flipping point of words! (see there are easy ways to get around using f*** in a book)|`|FAUPZeSxaa	If you use it once or twice in a circumstance that would be appropriate like if something really bad happened then maybe that would be okay.  I read this one book though (Feed by M. T. Anderson) that had so much swearing (F word included) I just stopped.  The book said 14+ and I am fourteen but I read a lot of books that are for that age level but I like them and they may have some swear words but not four really bad ones a page!  I think they are okay in certain circumstances once in a while because they add to the story.|`|f9b40efd5b7600a550f492fb27e76707aa	No as long as it is relevant and belongs in the text.|`|dPk7dr7laa	YES. We never like teens swearing. In fact I hate it when adults swear. It just shows how ignorant and uneducated someone is if all they can think of to describe how they feel or describe a noun is to use an expletive. That said, why would or should we use the swears in books that our teens will read. that is just telling them that it is ok and not giving them other options for words to use in it's place. A thesaurus is a good place to start if you need great Adj. for your books.|`|PzaJO1Ekaa	it depends on the context:<br>  <br>  as a swear word to show emotion such as "what the f***!"-yes but only to show emotion<br>  <br>  as an insult to a character such as "f*** you!' or "you f***ing idiot!"-maybe<br>  <br>  as a synonym for sex such as "i'm gonna f*** you!"-definitely not|`|SJGDtWROaa	Absolutely not. I believe that any cursing is just a form of art in most cases- i.e. Poems, stories, novels. Besides, most teenagers and young adults curse anyways.|`|alAtUXvyaa	no, it's just a word. i dont see why people get so worked up over swearing, to be honest....<br>  .....except around little kids obviously|`|RkNIs0rSaa	Yeah, it's just not necessary.|`|rrp9c2tnaa	Absolutely.  No editor would ever let it pass.|`|w7USF5wDaa	Well, you won't get it published, that's for sure.|`|Gox4ol8Zaa	Its fine...alot of teens swear, or are around swearing..|`|L0Jrx5anaa	no. fear of a word is idiotic and teenagers use it or even if they don't they hear it. at that age if somebody can't handle it then they need to adjust. and actually i have read a few with it so they can get published just not often.|`|xJyEhiHeaa	yes i think so and boys like girls who don't say bad word lol|`|VVH1KWaaaa	F*** no!|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Used in a quote by a character...no. But used for "shock" value, it should be nixed by the editor before the book is even in a final draft.|`|S4W7FojCaa	No, I don't think so. Teenagers use cursing as a second language.

fhR3MSbmaa	There's no strict delineation between story and short story. Generally, novels are published individually, while short stories are published in collections.     There's also no set number of words or pages (the page number also depends on the size of the type and the book), although most books are upwards of 200 pages.
HkXYGAOdaa	The original Aryan tribe was settled in the region now know as Iran thousands of years ago.  A portion of the tribe traveled west and re-settled in what is now the European continent.  <br>  <br>  The stigma associated with Aryans has no root in the culture or behavior of the Aryan tribe as a superior race.  It was only when Hitler decided to use it as a propaganda to unite German people behind him, that the term became a stigma.  And of course, there are illiterate and uneducated people throughout the world who equate Aryan with a superior race.  Neither is true.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	There is nothing superior about Aryans and they had nothing to do with Germany. And just about anybody in the US or Europe who uses the term to mean White Europeans, and that they are 'superior' are racists. <br>  <br>  No 'race' is superior. And Aryans were not (or are not) a 'race' but an ethnic group, probably of the Caucasian race, but darker than most Europeans. Hitler probably would have had a fit if he saw an "Aryan' from India walking down the street in Berlin. <br>  <br>  They came from what is now Iran or parts of the former Soviet Union, I'm not sure in today's terms what countries. <br>  <br>  They invaded India in ancient times, I don't know when  (PBS recently ran a good series I believe called "The Story of India", but I'm not sure. They talked about the different groups and invaders and religions, but I don't remember it all). The Aryans were more powerful than the people who were living in India at the time, and also somewhat lighter in skin color. They became the highest caste or class among the Indians. <br>  <br>  There are very few 'pure' of any group. People have been migrating and moving around since prehistory. Everybody is really a mixture, although some are more of one race or ethnic group than another.|`|ZB9zkbxxaa	From their language, also called Aryan, the Indo-European languages of South Asia are descended. In the 19th century there arose a notion, propagated by the count de Gobineau and later by his disciple Houston Stewart Chamberlain, of an “Aryan race”: people who spoke Indo-European, especially Germanic, languages and lived in northern Europe. The “Aryan race” was considered to be superior to all other peoples. Although this notion was repudiated by numerous scholars, including Franz Boas, the notion was seized on by Adolf Hitler and made the basis of the Nazi policy of exterminating Jews, Gypsies (Roma), and other “non-Aryans.”|`|BTk2yLqbaa	The Aryan people i.e. the group of Indo-Europeans who invaded India c 1500 BCE, were originally from the Caucasus region. They reached Iran before India, and the name Iran means Aryan. They may not have been superior but they acted as if they were. After the conquest of India, the caste system gradually arose in part because the Aryans generally lived apart from the darker skinned Indians, and long held the important or dominant positions in society.|`|GllB4mPZaa	If u r an indian!

ZZ0EYnNJaa	Look no further than the United States. There have been many American poets who have helped to shape craft and theory throughout the past 50 years and more. <br>  <br>  TS Eliot will probably be the "easiest" to do, at least in the sense that there is plenty of information about him online and in libraries. His poem "The Waste Land" is a masterpiece and has been the subject of volumes upon volumes of review and criticism (literary).<br>  <br>  Ezra Pound, whose major work was The Cantos, is the grandfather of the Modernist movement in poetry. He also founded vorticism,the poetic equivalent to cubism, and had a keen eye for new talent. He helped TS Eliot, James Joyce and others get published and was a major contributor to poetry.<br>  <br>  While a local library will almost certainly have the works I mentioned you may want to seek out a local college library for literary criticism and essays on the two poets. <br>  <br>  Also, google and wikipedia are great resources to start with. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

ceBTTCPwaa	The Giver is a novel written by Lois Lowry. It is set in a future society which is at first presented as a utopian society and gradually appears more and more dystopian; therefore, it could be considered anti-utopian. The novel follows a boy named Jonas through the twelfth year of his life. The society has eliminated pain and strife by converting to "Sameness", a plan which has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. Jonas is selected to inherit the position of "Receiver of Memory," the person who stores all the memories of the time before Sameness, in case they are ever needed to aid in decisions that others lack the experience to make. As Jonas receives the memories from the previous receiver—the "Giver"—he discovers how shallow his community's life has become. It is written in the 3rd person.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/The_Giver" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/The_Giver</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/giv/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/giv/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/giver/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/giver/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-113.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmTheGiver02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Either Jonas and Gabriel make it to Elsewhere, everyone is happy, and the world is right as rain, or…they die of exposure/starvation in the freezing snow.

M2thieHqaa	Most heroes are simply people who act when everyone else is frozen; they do what they must. The legends about them grow up later.    Yes, saving someone's life is a cliche, but it doesn't have to be. There are other ways to do this. Your character could, for example, discover a bomb in a building and organize the evacuation, saving dozens, maybe hundreds of lives. Or, he could discover a heart attack victim and perform CPR until the paramedics arrive. Lifesaving, without being cliched.     I would also advise you to read the book The Hero: Myth / Image / Symbol, by Dorothy Norman, which offers a complete breakdown of what a hero is.|`|wD82XTTHaa	he fights his inner demons|`|JYdnharfaa	well...well ur character can .. umm....idk...i need more info.

But if you have seen it, then you know what I mean.

AA10303012	Personally, I think the notion that the South fought the war to defend their states rights is hogwash, as its as though they were too embarrassed to say they were fighting to maintain slavery, because who wants to be known as a proponent of something which is so evil?  Also, one has to ask the question if the war would have been fought if there were no slavery?  I doubt it.  The South wouldnt have been so anxious to declare their states rights then.<br>  <br>  The North wanted an end to slavery, no question.  But President Lincoln's ultimate goal was to preserve the Union, he felt it was his duty, based on the oath of office he took, to defend this nation and preserve the Constitution.  When the South attacked Fort Sumter, it was considered to be a rebellion, against the Union and the Constitution he vowed to defend.<br>  <br>  What the South had to lose was their Ante Bellum lifestyle, which included the use of slaves, which ofcourse was a means of cheap labor.  The North conversely really had nothing to lose, things would have been pretty much the same in the North if the South had won their independence.<br>  <br>  The cost of the war was enormous, in all the manners you indicated, but was that cost justified?  You have to keep in mind what was at stake here--the American experiment of democracy, self rule.<br>  <br>  If the South had won the war, they would have justified the rationale that if a member of a union doesnt like the laws of such Union, then it has the right to abandon that Union.  If a state has the right to secede from the country, then why wouldnt a city have the right to secede from a State, and why not a neighborhood from a city?  What you are left with in that scenario is not self rule, it is not government, it is anarchy, it is chaos.  Whenever somebody doesnt like a law, they have the right to not obey it, to dissolve the union  The experiment of American democracy would have failed, and we could have reverted back to being a monarchy.<br>  <br>  Was it worth the cost of the lives of hundreds of thousands?  Hard to imagine, but probably, yes, it was.  The alternative could have been much worse.<br>  <br>  Finally, I dont think the Emancipation had much effect on the war at all.  The slaves were still captive to their masters, and even though they had their freedom, they had nowhere to go.|`|pI5jKfmaaa	The American Civil War (1861–1865), also known as the War Between the States and several other names, was a civil war in the United States of America. Eleven Southern slave states declared their secession from the U.S. and formed the Confederate States of America (the Confederacy). Led by Jefferson Davis, they fought against the U.S. federal government (the "Union"), which was supported by all the free states and the five border slave states.<br>  <br>  In the presidential election of 1860, the Republican Party, led by Abraham Lincoln, had campaigned against the expansion of slavery beyond the states in which it already existed. The Republican victory in that election resulted in seven Southern states declaring their secession from the Union even before Lincoln took office on March 4, 1861. Both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations rejected secession, regarding it as rebellion.<br>  <br>  Hostilities began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces attacked a U.S. military installation at Fort Sumter in South Carolina. Lincoln responded by calling for a volunteer army from each state, leading to declarations of secession by four more Southern slave states. Both sides raised armies as the Union assumed control of the border states early in the war and established a naval blockade. In September 1862, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation made ending slavery in the South a war goal, and dissuaded the British from intervening. Confederate commander Robert E. Lee won battles in the east, but in 1863 his northward advance was turned back at Gettysburg and, in the west, the Union gained control of the Mississippi River at the Battle of Vicksburg, thereby splitting the Confederacy. Long-term Union advantages in men and material were realized in 1864 when Ulysses S. Grant fought battles of attrition against Lee as Union general William Sherman captured Atlanta, Georgia and marched to the sea. Confederate resistance collapsed after Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.<br>  <br>  The American Civil War was the deadliest war in American history, causing 620,000 soldier deaths, and an undetermined number of civilian casualties, ending slavery in the United States, restoring the Union, and strengthening the role of the federal government. The social, political, economic and racial issues of the war decisively shaped the reconstruction era that lasted to 1877, and continue into the 21st century.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Ci...</a>

DvToP5h7aa	The Great Gatsby – F. Scott Fitzgerald <br>  <br>  Gatsby<br>  <br>  To understand Gatsby one has to look at not only his true life, but the life that he tried to create for himself. The truth is that he came from poor beginnings and created a fantasy world where he was rich and powerful. Even in his youth Gatsby was not content with what he had. He wanted money, so he managed to get it. He wanted Daisy, and she slipped through his fingers. So even when his wealth and stature are at their greatest, he will not be content. He must have Daisy. Yes, there is love. But more than that there is a drive to posses her because that is what he wanted for all of those years. She was part of his image for the future and he had to have her. And although Gatsby seems very kind, he is not afraid to be unscrupulous to get what he wants. When he wanted money, he was more than willing to become a bootlegger. His drive is what makes him who he is, good and bad. And it is this drive that ends up ruining his life. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.homework-online.com/tgg/charGatsby.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.homework-online.com/tgg/charG...</a>|`|suxCcXkAaa	Born James Gatz, son of a poor family, this man transforms himself into the wealthy Jay Gatsby who hosts glamorous parties each night at his home on Long Island.
