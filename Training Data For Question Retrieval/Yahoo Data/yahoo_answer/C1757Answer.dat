41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	Jamie McKintyre of CNN, said, at the time:<br>  <br>  "From my close-up inspection, there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon. <br>  <br>  The only site, is the actual side of the building that's crashed in. And as I said, the only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you pick up in your hand. There are no large tail sections, wing sections, fuselage, nothing like that anywhere around which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon and then caused the side to collapse."-that's his actual quote.<br>  <br>  After some people had a friendly chat with him, he changed his mind and said something else.<br>  <br>  Here are a few quotes about the collapses:<br>  <br>  Rich Banaciski -- Firefighter (F.D.N.Y.) [Ladder 22]  <br>  ... and then I just remember there was just an explosion. It seemed like on television they blow up these buildings. It seemed like it was going all the way around like a belt, all these explosions.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Brian Becker -- Firefighter (F.D.N.Y.) [Engine 28]  <br>  The collapse hadn't begun, but it was not a fire any more up there. It was like -- it was like that -- like smoke explosion on a tremendous scale going on up there.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Greg Brady -- E.M.T. (E.M.S.) [Battalion 6]  <br>  We were standing underneath and Captain Stone was speaking again. We heard -- I heard 3 loud explosions. I look up and the north tower is coming down now, 1 World Trade Center.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Timothy Burke -- Firefigter (F.D.N.Y.) [Engine 202]  <br>  But it seemed like I was going oh, my god, there is a secondary device because the way the building popped. I thought it was an explosion.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Ed Cachia -- Firefighter (F.D.N.Y.) [Engine 53]  <br>  we originally had thought there was like an internal detonation explosives because it went in succession, boom, boom, boom, boom, and then the tower came down.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Frank Campagna -- Firefighter (F.D.N.Y.) [Ladder 11]  <br>  You see three explosions and then the whole thing coming down.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Craig Carlsen -- Firefighter (F.D.N.Y.) [Ladder 8]  <br>  ... you just heard explosions coming from building two, the south tower. It seemed like it took forever, but there were about ten explosions.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Jason Charles -- E.M.T. (E.M.S.)  <br>  ... and then I heard an explosion from up, from up above, and I froze and I was like, oh, s___, I'm dead because I thought the debris was going to hit me in the head and that was it. <br>  ...<br>  I look over my shoulder and I says, oh, s___, and then I turned around and looked up and that's when I saw the tower coming down.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Frank Cruthers -- Chief (F.D.N.Y.) [Citywide Tour Commander]  <br>  .. there was what appeared to be at first an explosion. It appeared at the very top, simultaneously from all four sides, materials shot out horizontally. And then there seemed to be a momentary delay before you could see the beginning of the collapse.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Kevin Darnowski -- Paramedic (E.M.S.)  <br>  I heard three explosions, and then we heard like groaning and grinding, and tower two started to come down.  <br>   <br>  <br>  Dominick Derubbio -- Battalion Chief (F.D.N.Y.) [Division 8]  <br>  It was weird how it started to come down. It looked like it was a timed explosion ...  <br>   <br>  <br>  Karin Deshore -- Captain (E.M.S.)  <br>  Somewhere around the middle of the World Trade Center, there was this orange and red flash coming out. Initially it was just one flash. Then this flash just kept popping all the way around the building and that building had started to explode.  <br>   <br>  And this is what Norman Mineta said to the 9/11 commission (for some reason it was edited out of the final report of the 9/11 commission):<br>  Mineta: "During the time that the airplane was coming into the Pentagon, there was a young man who would come in and say to the Vice President...the plane is 50 miles out...the plane is 30 miles out....and when it got down to the plane is 10 miles out, the young man also said to the vice president "do the orders still stand?" And the Vice President turned and whipped his neck around and said "Of course the orders still stand, have you heard anything to the contrary!??"|`|9rhmeb7raa	September 13th on the streets of lower Manhattan after viewing the carnage Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said:<br>  "Well, it's clear now.

5gG2OfHIaa	The consumer is buying somewhat less.  The major loss of wealth for most families is in the decline in the value of their home.   Home buyers were borrowing on the equity in their homes and the decline in home prices hurt the people who overextended their credit.  Most people who have home for the purpose of a family dwelling are not materially impacted.  Yes, the tv news teams present the issue as some corrupt force harming the people who lived off the value of their home.   And the government wants to give these people who borrowed out the value of their home and second chance!!

ds5Vt2Evaa	I am not convinced that Chavez has a concrete plan - he has a few good ideas, but I don't believe his "new socialism" plan has clear substance or a clear direction. That, combined with his cracking down on the press when they're critical of him, his cult of personality, and his failure to build a political base, suggest that he's not serious about either socialism or about learning to fix some of the excesses it has shown in the past.<br>  <br>  As an American socialist, I find Chavez interesting, but not inspiring. He may be able to do some good through some of his plans, but the problems with his rule will harm his society in the long run.<br>  <br>  As for applying them to the United States, I don't think it's possible because he doesn't have a plan. Any attempts to apply socialism here should be based on a solid set of goals, at least a sketch of a plan to reach them that includes ideas about the transition, a commitment to a free press and personal liberties, and a party base that has numerous intellectuals who are comfortable with debate and disagreement both with each other and people outside the party. Any system that relies on one man is going to have problems if that man dies, and is prone to absorb the personality faults of that man.|`|Vbqci7Mdaa	I honestly dont know if I can be respectful and answer this question. Big Government is just that - "they want to do what THEY think is best for you". The problem is you don't know what their concerns are. Most of them ARE NOT held to the same rules and regulations as the rest of America. They don't want to let you make your own decision about HEALTHCARE, MEDICATION, CHILD CARE. They want to help you by making all your decisions for you. <br>  <br>  My reply is NO - that never works. Everyone has a different purpose to be on this planet and everyone is made different. Which means if you get a group of over 5 people together they will not agree on what is best for the whole group. You can come up with a BIG OVERVEIW of laws that work for most people in most circumstances but the small stuff cannot be written in stone.<br>  <br>  As for government take over - I hate to be the infomer that its already here in America. I can't goto a natural medical doctor because insurance descriminates against them. They have put natural farmers out of business to grow their crops scientificly. THEY don't care about the chemical imbalances in people or the diseases that it causes - because they are worried about overpolpulation. <br>  <br>  Everyone is worried about fat people because they are fat - most of them are fat due to chemical imbalances - which not only cause them to be overweight - but get diabetes, breast cancer, ect. No one wants to talk about why the same people who are over our phamacudicals are over our food. THEY should not be allowed to put all those chemicals in our food and dairy is the worst one. If you are not buying organic you should for your childs sake especially milk & eggs.<br>  <br>  Well I can rant on this subject ALL DAY but I wont - lol. I saw first hand how the medical industry when I had my first and only baby. Bottom line is that the ELITE like to be just that - they see no trouble taking your money. In America it seems that they offer us an illusion of freedom while stealing us blind in other ways. What really upsets me is how they do this to the poor by taking all their money for the healthcare stuff and then giving them the poorest care possible. Anyone who sees through their scam is quickly dealt with in severest mannor possible and then covered up.<br>  <br>  I wish this were a movie script I was talking about it but I have had a couple run ins already and know people who have experienced this first hand. So please take my word for it.<br>  <br>  I would love to send you a source but this is highly public and I dont want them shut down. If you do want to google SPLENDA and then goto a blog site of the dieters who have used this. Do not drink diet sodas and dont let your kids drink them - its a nurotoxin and very bad for your brain.<br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question - No unless the leaders are under the same rules and regulations as the rest of us their plans will not help anyone. Yes they are just trying to take over which is what anyone who SEEKS to be a ruler wants. I do not agree with the bailout. our system would have worked it just needed time. The big greedy industrys fell but new smaller more honest ones would have popped up in their place. Why give a crook more money for being a crook? It does not make common sence. <br>  <br>  As for Fanny Mae & Freddie Mac - they were making so much money with payoffs they did not care about the houseing market are the ramifications. Despite what the media claimed Mr. Bush did warn them along with many other people in congress but the people getting pay offs did not want to hear it. The problem was they sold homes to people who could not afford it - so trying to help these people make mortagages they couldn't pay to begin with is a JOKE. Sorry but if you can't afford a home lets get them into somewhere they can afford and give the homes to people who can afford them. That was all that needed to be done for that problem.|`|ujIinLzGaa	Of course it would not work.  Every time a government says it wants to "take care of the people," what it means is that it wants to totally control the people.  It has been this way throughout history.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	The people of America are much better informed. They see whats happening with the push towards socialism and gov. run businesses such as the banks, and a backlash has started.  Chavez also has made it possible for him to run the country indefinately.  I heard rumors that Obama wanted to change the constitution so he could do the same here. It seems Obama has alot in common with Chavez.|`|PRj5F2CPaa	I see only one difference between Chavez and Obama. The media in Venezuela is trying to wake up the people. Here in America the media is putting us to sleep.<br>  <br>   Anyone going against Obama is ripped apart by a media. A media that hasn't told the truth since Walter Cronkite told America we could not win the war in Vietnam after the Tet Offensive. A battle that wiped out the Viet Cong and 90% of the North Vietnam Military. Shameful isn't the word of our media. A more fitting word is treason.|`|Iea4UeItaa	Sadly, there are enough dumb people in the US to be blind to Chavez's power struggle and support him.  Hopefully, there are enough people here that won't allow it to happen. And hopefully, Venezuelans can be freed of that dictator soon.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	If by "work" you mean spread deprivation and empower the central authority, then yes, it would work here. It works like that everywhere and every time it's tried.|`|LEdg6EHpaa	The stories you cite, highlight the need for a free media.  The masses can be manipulated by a lack of objective information.  I wouldn't mind some balance for the conservative blowhards that crowd the AM airwaves, but that is another issue.  <br>  As for Chavez' plans being applied here, I don't think it would work at all.  Despite a large population of ignorant people, everyone here believes in the American Dream.  I don't think tough times will kill that dream.  <br>  However, I recall arguing during the height of the ridiculous argument or slogan "drill here, drill now," that we should nationalize our oil reserves.  The oil companies could get a stipend to drill and refine OUR oil, but that would actually increase supply and we would affect the price and avoid the manipulation that is a hallmark of that industry.  I only apply that to oil, because it is in our territorial waters, not someones property, so we own it collectively.  <br>  As for taking productive business into custody to be owned and run by the government?  It will never happen.  It is only happening now, because the greedy management, left unchecked by the previous administration, drove the banking industry into dust.  Now they suck at the teet of our tax breast, and we get some ownership stake in return.  Not as well negotiated on our behalf by government officials as by Warren Buffett, but, what can we really expect, right?<br>  We aren't becoming Venezuela.

1b9fbd13ce796d4a53e1675c60b78414aa	I suspect that there is a big mark up on cars in the first place.  Much of the loss on the car market is fake anyways.  I mean it's like me drawing a picture at home for $1.00 in supplies and then trying to sell it on ebay for $100.00 but only selling it for $10.00 and claiming a $90.00 loss.

N3OB7M8maa	All of those who voted for Obama will in my opinion will be wishing they hadn't before this is over. Since he was elected, the Dow has fallen faster in 6 weeks than it did under any president in the last 90 years.<br>  <br>  I don't care what color Obama is. He could be white, black, green purple or orange, as long as he was for the American people, and not trying to push socialism, and possibly communism down our throats.<br>  <br>  He is spending so much of our money, it's pathetic. Even after bashing George Bush for his deficit, Obama has tripled it.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't stop spending, our country could go bankrupt. Then what wouldwe do. We would be dependent on government for everything, just like the former Soviet Union. But I believe that's what he wants.<br>  <br>  I could see right through Obama's "hope" for America. His hope is that we become a socialist/communist regime.<br>  <br>  He has also lied about wanting to do away with earmarks. But the $410 billion omnibus spending bill has 8500 earmarks, and if passed by the senate, he is expected to sign it, after campaigning that he wouldn't. If he does, he is a liar, and the truth is not in him.<br>  <br>  Every man woman, and child in America right now would owe the government $36,000 each to cover the current deficit. My grandchildren will be paying that for decades to come.<br>  <br>  Fasten your seatbelt and hold on. We are in for a rough ride.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	Barak Obama is not SUPERMAN.

He is not stupid, just the masses, the mob, the Libs the LYNCH MOB IS IGNORANT.<br>  He, Obama, must declare under penalty of perjury that he is a U.S. citizen, if he does that, he still is free, and considered an innocent, because the DA must prove behind a reasonable doubt that he, OBAMA committed the perjury.  Than the like O.J.s jury will set him free.  Any questions?<br>  Our freedom has created this dilemma, therefore, protect the freedom for all, for Obama and for me, and ask the question why Obama is not defending such freedom for all.  Why is he taking only advantage of our freedom, LIKE THE TERRORISTS DID?   He, Obama, with his actions, disgrace the USA in front of the entire World? <br>  If this part of the constitution is change, that is OK with me, maybe Arnold can run next, but our constitution should not be bluntly disregard!<br>  <br>  JUST see THE PRESS VIDEO, AND see HOW FRUSTRATED THE LADY LAWER IS: she knows the STALIN, HITLER, CASTRO, and SCHAVES SOCIALISTIC FREEDOM.

AA10344136	It's ironic that the ACLU is purportedly "patriotic" to American democracy---but are being secretly funded by Socialist supporters---mainly Scientologists; a pretty wealthy whacked out, but politically connected bunch.  A few of their celebrity members allowed a slip of their mouths to reveal their support.  Many of America's wealthiest Atheists also back up the ACLU as well; people who want THEIR twisted view of America to unfold.<br>  <br>  Good luck finding attorneys ready to crack well guarded ACLU financial secrets: I don't see many stepping up to the plate to try.<br>  <br>  The ACLU not only enjoy the $$$$ they discreetly get---they LOVE sponge soaking up TV and print media exposure; they're ego-junikies.<br>  <br>  It's interesting to note that albeit true the ACLU does win frivolous lawsuits against many U.S. cities and towns---those same cities and towns DEFY against the ACLU.  And when the media cameras sway from the controversy, the ACLU scurry away---not making an effort to fight back to gain their lawsuit awards; they're fast off to the next media circus.|`|mUMMLjDdaa	if th aclu finds that americans lives were saved by torturing terrorist they should stop their lawsuit or it should be thrown out as a <br>  frivolous lawsuit. i think their funding should be public to be sure<br>  terrorist are in no way backing them financially. excellent question<br>  and point rob.|`|qbhDBdApaa	News-<br>  <a href="http://outlookindia.info/" rel="nofollow">http://outlookindia.info/</a>|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	They will never stop their evil ways.

Iran changed to the Islamic republic of Iran. Just like the french revolution is over. My country is now called the Republic of France.<br>  Khoumani died many years ago. They have an ayatollah, a supreme leader who is the head of state, and a president is elected below him. Khoumani was the first ayatollah, there is another one now.<br>  <br>  The revolutions startd because the king on the throne of Iran was nothimg more than a dictator who lived in paradise whilst people died of hunder on the streets. All this was encouraged and aided by the americans.<br>  <br>  The Iraq - Iran war was encouraged by once again the Americans who supplied Saddam with intelligence saying Iran was weak and not yet capable to defend itself, and also sold chemical weapons to saddam to use on the Iranians. Hundreds of thousands of Iranians died, and the people did what they could to defend themselves - don't forget the jews during the holocaust were the first to fashion suicide bomb vests, and they were hailed as heroes worldwide. You do what you have to do.<br>  <br>  You make me laugh, you are so brainwashed by the american government i don't think you even realise it. Operation Iraqi freedom is nearly done? Operation Afghani enduring freedom? Are you serious?<br>  <br>  Iraq has been flatenned, there is little infrastructure left, over a million iraqis have died of which the large majority are civilians directly at the hand of the americans, WMDs were never found, a US puppet sits as prime-minister, and a square mile of Iraq is surrounded by a wall in which the buildings are made of marble and where that puppet sits. Nearly done? What freedom?<br>  <br>  Afghanistan is a joke. The people see the americans as invaders, an army not welcome in the nation. The whole conflict in any arab nation is simply for equality between people in the middle east and westerners / white people. They want the same human rights, the right to life and to live somewhere without fear of Israel/America/UK sticking their finger in. Until you understand that lupines you will never understand why people in the arab world are ready to lay down their lives, why there is so much hate towards america.

The problem is that most Muslim political & religious bodies are either supporting this 'newer version' of Islam, or keeping silence on it. <br>  <br>  Things can't be changed, if Muslims themselves don't try to understand the horror of Islamic extremism, & condemn such act. Not non-Muslims, but only Muslims can give a  hope to the world to get rid of Islamic terrorism. But still such movements 've not gained pace(though some ppl are trying).|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hi.  It is true what you say there is good that can be gleaned if one overlooks the more ancient wording on how to handle things (don't stone, cut off hands for stealing, kill all infidels etc.)  but the problem arises where the Iranians are creating quite an extremist movement.  They call it the Islamic Revolution and it started in their country 1979.<br>  <br>  They go by Khomeini doctrine which says that if they have to kill every Persian to spread Islam worldwide that is fine by them.  The problem is that it is their particular brand of Islam that it is so very violent.  During the Iran-Iraq war, the sent thousands of their Persian children into the Iraqi minefields to clear it for the soldiers.  The children were armed with "plastic keys to Paradise."  Their nation regularly chants Death to America, Death to Israel, and we will move on to Europe and rule the World.<br>  <br>  While I do acknowledge there are other imman in other Muslim countries that do preach the hate, it is actually fueled in epicenter by Iran.<br>  <br>  When Iran can sacrifice their own children for such a cause, you can see, that the rest of us are also meaningless to them.  Iran regularly shows suicide bombing cartoons to their primetime children and how Islam will rule the world and this is also a strategy used by the rest of the extremists that are allied with their cause. Within the extremist movement there has already been a request for a nuclear suicide bomber and Iran is currently seeking nuclear capability.<br>  <br>  There are moderate nations within Islam that are preventing, or trying to prevent, such occurence.  I do not have issue with their religion because the ones that have updated it without the violence are monotheistic believers such as myself. I just have issues from the violence that is emanating from the Islamic movement and also to let you know, that movement is MASSIVE. <br>  <br>  They are up to 60+ Muslim dominated countries now, and there is movement in Western nations, and the way the West is operating now is very dangerous. To show the West the proper way to handle this, I can show the American example.<br>  <br>  America was founded on freedom FROM religious aggression.  At no time was our religious tolerance law designed to infer we remain passive when faced with aggression from a hostile religion.  It is actually quite the opposite.<br>  <br>  People misunderstand the religious tolerance laws, and appease them and fear the violence, when they should actually be trying to fight it.  To remain passive in the threat of a hostile religion just gives them red carpet to take one's home country over.<br>  <br>  The moderate Muslim nations are not liking what's happening either, just to let you know, because radical Islam knows no national borders. The kicker is to know who's who.  It is dangerous and difficult to treat them all the same and not sacrifice the peaceful one to fight the aggressive one.  I think it is just helpful to know which nations are hostile and which are not.<br>  <br>  Iran-Syria-Qatar-Hezbollah-Hamas = bad<br>  Saudi - Egypt - Jordan = good<br>  <br>  Currently there is takeover in nuclear armed Pakistan and in Sudan and UAE and Bahrain and Lebanon and of course the never ending assault on Israel by Iran and their allies.  They are also encroaching their laws in Europe. Their mode operandi is to get an "edge in" to whichever state they wish to control and start influencing the people by violence and intimidation and operating as a state within a state.<br>  <br>  We are fighting a war that we can very much win but we're just missing some troops in the fight both internally in our Western nations, and on foreign soil.  Operation Iraqi freedom is nearly done, but in Afghanistan Operation Enduring Freedom we're not close to being done.  Afghanistan is bordering Pakistan who has nuclear capability and it's imperative that region remain stable.<br>  <br>  Pertaining to fighting them within our Western countries one cannot appease or bend not one iota on Western law to succomb to PC one actually has to make them assimilate into our laws insteading of bending our laws to suit them.  That's the way it goes when one has 60+ countries already don't like the laws in the West then don't live here!!!<br>  <br>  Threat Of Islam In The West<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76STxsWJCCE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76STxsWJC...</a><br>  <br>  Operation Enduring Freedom<br>  <a href="http://icasualties.org/oef/" rel="nofollow">http://icasualties.org/oef/</a><br>  Dodge Afghanistan Troop Issue<br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090207/ap_on_re_eu/eu_germany_security_conference">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090207/ap_o...</a> <br>  <br>  Recent Discussion Islam on the Move<br>  <a href="http://memri.org/bin/latestnews.cgi?ID=IA49209" rel="nofollow">http://memri.org/bin/latestnews.cgi?ID=I...</a>

These CEOs all failed to call the right shots, during their "glory days", and ADAPT to necessary product evolutionary changes brought on by the Internet.<br>  <br>  And now, their timing in making the right calls really sucks--for now, people's jobs within this profession are at stake---and in it's wake, a bounty of useless paper wasted because their news product is online.<br>  <br>  The newsprint media corporation CAN be saved; society just has to accept the hard copy newspaper pretty much is a thing of the past---or is very close to being so.  Keep the staff and shift product focus on online production.  The trick here is to BALANCE subscription pricing---not over the top price gouging rates---for BOTH hard copy AND online subscription newsprint production.  To achieve this balance, SLIGHT advertising rates may have to increase.<br>  <br>  Done right, newsprint media won't be forced to lay off staff in epic numbers, the public can still get it's coveted hard copy paper AND subscribers can view daily newspaper issues online.  Just be sure to ONLY put out the needed hard copy w/out waste output.<br>  <br>  There again, QUALIFIED newsprint media CEOs are needed here---so some ought to and deserve to be FIRED and replaced by leaders who CAN save America's newspapers.|`|3ixmHSwmaa	I wonder...<br>  <br>  Even the L.A,Times is in trouble! <br>  <br>  The only model that has any chance of sustained life in my opinion is to stick to what they do best.

Selena also hasn't gotten into media problems like the chinky face miley made or that photo shopped pic with her friend. Selena is also a great actress like in "Another Cinderella Story" because the character she played is more modern day and relatable. But honestly, I know you're not asking for my opinion on Miley but the Hannah Montana character she plays makes my head spin because these stories are getting faker. Bring back a character, kick out a character... blah blah blah.<br>  Selena's show has a timeline, like before going to the academy place and after her friend found out she was a wizard. <br>  <br>  Actually now that I think about it, they can be the same.

A white paper is something issued by a government, or perhaps a business, that explains a certain subject in detail.  It would be intended to clearly state a position on the subject.<br>  <br>  In journalism, a feature article is something that isn't straight coverage of an event.  In other words, a story about the city council meeting wouldn't be a feature, but a story about how the mayor grew up and always dreamed of making the town better would be a feature.  Or, a story about how the local baseball team beat the other team 3-2 wouldn't be a feature, but a story about how the third baseman fought back from a bad car accident and is now able to play again would be a feature.

Then you have to pay state taxes and property taxes which are always going up. Obama is also going to tax businesses more. I just wonder what's going to happen when the people who create businesses can't handle the taxes any more, and more businesses fail. That means more people out of work.

The United States' Bush Doctrine stated that, as policy, it would not distinguish between al-Qaeda and nations that harbor them.Bush ,unlike Obama,was a practical man and he very quickly understood what the peple alwys knew ,i.e. that you can not win th war in silk gloves.<br>  Many people think that America is fghting alone in Afganistan.As much,Great Britain assists her.It′s not so. By January 12, 2009,the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) had around 55,100 troops from 41 countries(all the NATO countries,including Canada,and many non-NATO cuntries,including Turkey ,Jordan and United Arab Emirates), with NATO members providing the core of the force. The United States has approximately 23,300 troops in ISAF.<br>  The U.S. and the UK led the aerial bombing campaign, with ground forces supplied primarily by the Afghan Northern Alliance.<br>  <br>  With Iraq,the situaion is not so clear.Iraq deliberately tried to create the impression that it had the nuclear weapons,constantly denying the inspectors of the Atomic Agency the entrance to certain objects.At the same time,in the course of the strike on Iraq in 1991 the Allies got the undeniable proofs that Iraq had been working over the nuclear bomb project,and Hussein,under the weight of the proofs, had to recognize this and to sign the document that Iraq would stop all the investigations and works in the atomic energy field.<br>  Hussein was the mortal enemy of the USA and called to destroy it the innumerable number of times.Let′s not forget that according to the UN Charter,if a UN member calls to destroy or attack another UN member,it′s considered to be an attack and enough reason for putting the economic sanctions on the infringer,and if she continues with her bloodthirty calls, this country may face the perspective of the military strike.<br>  When Hussein started to play games with the inspectors ,Bush was for 2 years trying to make Hussein open all the objects for inspection.And only in March of 2003,when he got the report of the CIA which supported his doubts,Bush ordered to attack Iraq.His logic was very simple;if I am wrong and Iraq has not the WMD,all the same to liberate Iraq of Hussein and eliminate one of the worst America′s enemies will be a good deed.And if Iraq HAS WMD,then I shall save the lives of dozens of thousands of Americans.<br>  Bush acted absolutely right in that situation,like a true leader, and that Americans now cover him with dirt and are ready to kiss Obama in that place where the back loses its name and becomes something else,screaming with joy over "how politically correct,liberal and non-racist we are" only shows that at least 60% of the modern Americans are so dumb that they can not even count fingers at their two hands.<br>  They are ten,guys.<br>  <br>  D.S.,what you have written  is a bullshiit.The prices of oil did not fall after the invasion in Iraq;they GREW more than 2,5 times.The actual gainer was Iraq,together with other oil-exporting countries.And America is netto - IMPORTER of oil.<br>  Another one who can not count fingers and sum 2+2!|`|6ade8f304e48ef25e16f2a4444611313aa	"America' didn't invade. bush and his followers, the neocons and a useless Congress invaded Iraq and Afghanistan.

The ostensible reason for invading Afghanistan doesn't really make sense, since the Taliban offered to turn OBL over for trial. Mostly there seems to have been an optimistic belief that if we toppled the Taliban, we could install a pro-western secular government. It was pretty nave belief judging from history. There was also an element of vengeance it it, Americans are bloodily vengeful people when it comes right down to it, but they like it to be sanitized and kept out of sight.<br>  <br>  As for Iraq, it's even more complicated. The ostensible reason was just propaganda, the idea that Iraq was some sort of threat to the USA doesn't pass the laugh test, and even if they had attacked the USA, we would have turned Iraq into a parking lot. Again it appears they they thought the Iraqi people would be so grateful to be "liberated" by the USA that a secular pro-USA government would be easy to install, and maybe even help topple other anti-USA governments in the region. Again, a remarkable naive belief, but idealists in general can be remarkably obtuse.<br>  <br>  Oil certainly figured into it, a desire to contain Iran was also a measure. They also really needed to shut Saddam up, because he was trying to turn Iraq into a modern secular state, the USA fears true democracy in the world more than anything else. Plus Saddam had the insanely radical idea that the Middle East's oil wealth should be re-invested in the Middle East, a far more dangerous idea than anything OBL has ever come up with.<br>  <br>  And Bush's personal and psychological make up also played a part, he wanted to "finish" the job his dad started. And religious reasons may have played a role, Bush did say that "God told him to invade Iraq." <br>  <br>  So who knows really, some or all of the above. The real reasons may not be known for decades, if ever.|`|DS2huIAkaa	Excuses like "to fight terrorism" and "to bring democracy" are fodder for the gullible sheep who are too lazy to use whatever tiny brain they may have.<br>  <br>  1. IRAQ: Petrodollar (OIL). The USA managed to get oil to be bought and sold internationally in $. Any time US wants to buy oil it just prints more $. However, Iraq and Venezuela accept any currency for their oil except the $, forcing the US to buy foreign currency which costs more than simply printing $.<br>  Also, oil in Iraq is the easiest to get out of the ground - there are places where it oozes from the ground on the surface. NB: The Bush family are oil billionaires and, the major contracts to rebuild what the US destroyed went to US construction corporations to be paid by Iraq itself from its oil revenue. Nice!<br>  <br>  2. Afghanistan is a classic US oversimplifying, short-sighted and idiotic foreign policy where "the enemy of my enemy is my friend". To get USSR out of Afghanistan, the US backed fundamentalists who were equally against USSR and US, both of them being secular foreigners interfering in their country, but were most happy to receive free US arms to fight the Russians. Once the Russians left, they turned on their other enemy, the US. It is the US that armed and financed Bin Laden in the first place. If the US can turn on ex-allies at whim, why think it so strange that ex-allies can turn on the US?|`|50UbJp14aa	oil|`|gqmtPx8gaa	America went into Afghanistan because that government refused to turn over Osama Bin Laden for the attack on 9/11.
