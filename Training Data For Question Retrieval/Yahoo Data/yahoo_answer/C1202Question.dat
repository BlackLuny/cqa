To use one example, I believe I'm right in thinking the modern understanding of the evolutionary tree explains that fish slowly became somewhat amphibious by developing stronger and stronger fins/flaps/whatever that eventually became limbs which allowed said fish to become land dwelling lizards and reptiles...      Should it therefore be theoretically possible that we could selectively breed a type of fish in order to turn it into an amphibian/lizard?? (even if we needed to subject the species to appropriate environmental pressures in order to 'encourage' them onto land) And could we not, theoretically, produce these changes far faster than natural selection managed?      If so, why hasn't anyone done it/tried it yet?      If not, what are the additional process(es) that have to occur in order to affect such a change from one species to another, and how do they come about?      Cheers!

I understand how to solve regular linear combinations, but with story problems, it is just too difficult for me. Any tips, help with the following problems???:       1. David has 83 coins in nickels and dimes. He has a total of $6.95. How many of each coin does he have?       (guessing: equations would be n+d=83, 0.05n+0.10d=6.95)      2. Tonia is 25 years younger than her father. The sum of their ages is 75. How old is each now?    (This answer is obvious, but my algebra teacher forces us to show our work)      3. Angela has 27 coins in quarters and nickels. she has a total of $5.35. How many of each coin does she have?

20090202145759AAP9mTN	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics Question - Please Help!?	The figure below shows a two-ended "rocket" that is initially stationary on a frictionless floor, with its center at the origin of an x axis. The rocket consists of a central block C (of mass M = 6.00 kg) and blocks L and R (each of mass m = 2.80 kg) on the left and right sides. Small explosions can shoot either of the side blocks away from block C and along the x axis. Here is the sequence: (1) At time t = 0, block L is shot to the left with a speed of 3.40 m/s relative to the velocity that the explosion gives the rest of the rocket. (2) Next, at time t = 0.80 s, block R is shot to the right with a speed of 3.40 m/s relative to the velocity that the explosion gives to block C?

In the spectroscopic technique experiments I was provided with river water evidence sample and had to determine whether it was unpolluted (no coloured dye present) or if the sample contains any level of the pollutants in the water.   In the first experiment I used a colorimeter to determine the absorbance values for the river water at a range of wavelengths.   In the second experiment I used a colorimeter again to determine the absorbance values for the water reference samples of known concentration.   In the third experiment I placed the river water sample along with five dyes on a chromatogram to determine which dyes the river water contained.

So the rate of production of a certain is product is given by   dx/dt = 5000 (1 -  (100/(t+10)^2) products per week.   that's 5000 times the quantity one minus the quantity 100 divided by (t+10) squared.      the problem is to find the number of products produced from the beginning of the third week to the end of the fourth week, where t is weeks.      So, beginning to solve...      x = 5000 ?1 - 100/(t+10)^2 dx.                 ?   now one should substitute. No idea what to substitute for. I thought maybe (t+10) which would give a dx of 1, which exists....      No idea. Any help guys? Thanks! ;-]

20090202174557AAo2B9Z	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Math Question - Fractions?	I've just started my grade 10 Math credit at High School and we're working on fractions as supposed review from last year. There was a type of question I can't seem to get right in the subtraction field. I know the basics of subtracting fractions by now but I'm not sure what to do when the second fraction's denominator is negative. Here's an example:      (-3/4) - (1/-4)      I know that the answer is -1/2, but I fail to see how one gets there. What I did was add 8 to the denominator of the second fraction so it was the same as the denominator of the first fraction. I then added 8 to the numerator of the second fraction because what you do to the bottom needs to be done to the top. I'm now left with this:      (-3/4) - (9/4)      That doesn't result in my answer of -1/2. This may be a stupid question for a grade 10, but can someone please explain the proper way to handle questions like these?

20090202185259AAO8li9	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Paranormal Phenomena	Paranormal.... Ghost throwing nickels?	I had a paranormal experience this morning i think... Well i walked into my bathromm and turned the shower on. I then turned around having my back face my shower. i shut the door and the all of the sudden a nickel flew past my face and hit then wall and fell on the floor. No one was in my bathrrom besides me and my dad was gone and my sister was upstairs getting ready for school. it was like inches away from my face and it looked like it was thrown with force. Like someone was trying to hit me. It was sooooo strange. I stood there thinking of a logical explaination for it. There is a vent in there but i wouldnt shoot a coin that fast. I also noticed that on my floor i had 1 quarter and 2 nickels on my floor, and when i went back to my room , one nickel was gone. So someone or something must of took it from my room. I wouldve seen someone come in the door and throw it at me, but thats not the case. What do i do? is this a ghost or just some wierd thing that happened. My house was built in 1997 and no one has lived in it besides me... and this wierd thing has never happened to me before. Could it have been i was really tired and i was seeing things? because i was , realllllly tired but it seemed so real. and its hard to remmeber because it happened so fast...what do i do? should i try to talk to it? does it want my attention?

Once the problem is solved, I can see it.   ---------------------------------      My attempt:      First, by looking at the problem, I figured that you should be solving for the left side due to the subtraction sign (You want common denominators? Not sure).       cscθ reduces to 1/sinθ, therefore,      1/sinθ - sinθ = cotθcosθ               I got stumped here. Shucks.

Here are the directions:   Write an equation for each line in point-slope form and slope-intercept form.      and the problem is:      Slope =4, passing through (1, 3)      I don't get how I'm supposed to right it in point slope form if i only have 1 set of x's and y's, because it's m=y2-y1/x2-x1.   and i don't get how to write the slope intercept form either.      I know what both the forms are, i just don't understand how i'm supposed to write the equation for both forms when i have limited information. Can anyone help please?

20090202200706AAVgkVC	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Hydrostatics: Multiple Choice?	1. Imagine you are on a bus with a helium balloon tied on a string tied to the seat in front of you. The bus stops short to avoid running over a rabbit and you are thrown forward. What happens to the balloon in relation to the bus?   1. The balloon’s position does not change.   2. The balloon moves forward.   3. The balloon pops.   4. The balloon moves backward.      I believe its motion doesn't change, due to the relativistic nature of the person in the bus. Unless it moves backward because it's lighter than the bus (odd though)....      2. A piece of iron is sitting on a block of wood floating in water. If the iron were instead suspended beneath the wood, would the wood float at the same level, lower, or higher?      1. Higher, because there is a buoyant force   acting on the iron now.   2. It depends on the ratio of iron and wood   volumes.   3. Definitely lower, because the iron is under   the wood.   4. It would float only slightly lower, because   the iron displaces a little water and the overall   water level rises.   5. It would float at the same level.      I guess 3 because iron is much more dense than wood, and the force of it is less spread out      3. A barge filled with scrap iron is in a canal lock. If the barge were to sink what would happen to the water level?   1. It would fall.   2. It would remain unchanged.   3. It would rise.   4. It would depend on its mass.      I would say 2 because it doesn't matter how much of a substance is in the water, it only matters whether it's sinking down or not...      Thanks a lot guys!

20090202203610AAIVvsK	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Problem solving physics dealing with work done, and kinetics energy.?	Im kind stuck on this problem, plz help      In the 1950s, an experimental train, which had a mass of 2.50 x 10^4kg, was powered across a level track by a jet engine that produced a thrust of 5.00 X 10^5 N for a distance of 509 m      a. Find the work done on the train.   b. Find the change in kinetic energy   c. Find the final kinetic energy of the train if it started from rest.   d.  Find the final speed of the train if there had been no friction      I did some of it already, but i dont know if its right    a) which wd=fd, so i did (5.00X 10^5n)(509m)=2.55X10^5N/m   b) the initial KE, I got is 0J, and the final KE is 2.03X10^14J, so i did the difference but question c seems to be asking the same thing as b

20090202204150AACnoUg	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Question about Thevenin equivalence?	I've got a pretty simple problem where the numbers don't seem to add up.  I'm analyzing a very simple circuit which looks like a wire rectangle cut down the middle with another wire.  On the left is an independent voltage source, 5V, with the positive terminal facing up.  It's in series with a 10k ohm resistor.  On the right side is an independent current source providing 100 microamps of current in the upwards direction, in series with a 100k ohm resistor.  The middle wire contains the "load" resistor, which is 22k ohms.  I'm supposed to find the Thevenin equivalent circuit for this resistor.  The Thevenin voltage and current are easy enough to calculate, being 6V and 100 uA, respectively.  Rth = Vth / Ith = 60000 ohms, but I also thought that Rth can be calculated by suppressing the voltage/current courses and looking at the equivalent resistance between the two points in question.  Doing this, though, only gives an Rth of 10k ohms.  What gives?

20090202204542AAgQ7Bv	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Why are these the answers?	1, f(x) = 2x   domain is all reall numbers, range is all real numbers   I think I get why the domain is.  Because any number you substitute for x will result in a real number. I guess I just don't know where y(range) comes into play.        3, h(x) = -0.6√x  Domain [0, infinity) Range (infinity,0]  Why?      5, m(x) = 3lxl  Domain all real numbers. Again,I think I get this because you put anything in for x, you end up with a real number. Lost on the range again. I see that it's [0,infinity) in my book but I don't know why.   7, r(x) = x^3  Domain is all real numbers. Got this. I don't know why the range is also all real numbers.

20090202142245AACQ6nz	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Conditional Probability Question?	Here is a question from my genomics course:      p(A)=0.2, p(T) = 0.2, p(C) = 0.3, p(G) = 0.3      p(E) = probability that 1st base is C or T.  I already got that this is 0.5      p(G) = probability that a random 2 nucleotide chosen is CA or CC.      The question is calculate the p(G) given p(E) --> p(G I E)      I read in my book that if the events are independent, which they are, then p(G I E) just equals p(G), which in this case should be p(CC) + p(CA) = 0.15.      But this doesn't make sense to me, since the prob of getting CC or CA should be higher given the first base is C or T, since it is impossible to select a dinucleotide starting with G or A.      Any help?
