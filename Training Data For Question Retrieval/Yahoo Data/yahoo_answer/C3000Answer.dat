AA11452852	The answer is very simple.  There are three rules to follow.      1. The minimum wage in Illinois for all employees 18 or older  is $7.75 per hour.    2. The minimum wage for employees under age 18 is $7.25.    3.  The minimum wage for tipped employees is $4.65 per hour, IF (and only if) their tips bring them over $7.75.  In other words, the minimum wage for tipped employees is still $7.75, but you can credit part of their tip earnings toward meeting the minimum.    The Illinois Department of Labor has a Web page that explains all of this:  http://www.state.il.us/agency/idol/faq/q...    I hope this helps.  Good luck!!
