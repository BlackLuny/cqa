x9snNxZmaa	Well it seems a lot of people are using Craigs List for anything nowdays, so you might try your luck there and see what happens. In case your not sure what it is, Craigs List is just like Ebay but more localized and you can find most anything there. Not sure if I can post links on here, but it is craigslist dot com in case you need it.

The International Bible Society started putting them in hotels in 1823.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	Staying in hotels actually used to be incredibly dangerous. There was more than a small chance that you would be robbed/murdered/etc. So people wanted to have a Bible close by in case they needed to get right with the Lord at short notice.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Evangelism basically. <br>  The ones I see are almost always from the Gideons who are an evangelical group. They put the bibles in hotels because there are lots of people who would see them, and a lot of the time people are lonely or something when they're at the hotel. If you look at their bible they have little things at the start like- 'in time of need/troubles you should read these passages', etc. They also give bibles out to military and other groups, but the hotel thing is really to reach a large and possibly more receptive than average group of people to convert/'save'. <br>  <br>  I think the other groups that distribute bibles to hotels have basically the same mission. I've also seen the Book of Mormon too, probably there for the same reason.|`|5L6z92Iqaa	Most hotels do still have bibles in the rooms. Some of the newer hotels going up might not since it is more of a tradition than a requirement but your almost always guaranteed to find one in a slightly older hotel or motel.|`|cZmZDDbiaa	i dont know, i think it is respect or somthing, but bad as many non christians stay in hotels, like muslims ect :S|`|l2A2kCIPaa	hmmm i never really noticed any wen i go...guess im not payin enuff attention|`|zWB3jHHPaa	idk.. is there?<br>  that's pretty f-ed up considering the filth that goes on in hotels lol
3jrSCkzqaa	they arnt scabby as you put it.<br>  <br>  But the main reason was to let the local dignataries have a freebie fact finding mission to their counterpart, at the taxpayers expense, and visa versa, so all the pigs in the trough were happy|`|lynmeenmaa	get over urself|`|7ymCQYxMaa	What's your problem? Britain has as many 'lovely' and 'scabby' parts as the rest of Europe and twinning is a way of linking us to the mainland, i may never visit Chaumont, France but my little town of Ashton-Under-Lyne, Manchester is twinned with it.
SC6YCYOvaa	The summer programs admit just about anyone who is willing to pay, but that doesn't mean they are no good. I'm sure you'll learn a lot and have some fun in NYC. You'll get out of it whatever you put into it.<br>  <br>  During the summer, most students at NYU and Columbia go home, so both schools use their summer programs to gain some extra revenue and to fill classes which would be otherwise be empty.<br>  <br>  I've taken summer classes at both NYU and Columbia and they were not bad at all. In fact, campus will be nice and empty which is a nice change from the hectic fall and spring semesters.<br>  <br>  In summary, as long as you'll be studying something you are interested in and the credits transfer to another program which would give you some kind of terminal degree or certificate, I don't see any problem with taking part in one of these summer programs.<br>  <br>  Have fun!

Without "educated" voter , who not sell their rights and rare privilege of voting a qualified ruler, the Philippines will not move any further.  Too many Filipinos are working abroad, making other counties better and richer, leaving the Philippines behind in many aspects.  Our brain drain, our love for better life materially, leaving our country in chaos and suffering, heaven knows and only heaven can help!  But please remember; "Ang bayan kong Pilipinas, pugarin ng ginto't bulaklak ........!"|`|YALlJatBaa	I shall strong arm Bill Gates, or some other Billionaire to invest in my Delta Planes.   These are circular flying units, to be manned by ten or so crew each, and with anti-gravitic propulsion.   They shall link the islands with each other, by hourly flights from any point to any point, say eight thousand units, to bring medical supplies, educational supplies, liquor, girls, you name it.   They shall also be able to form a defense shield,  in case the U.S. Supreme Court decides Billy was guilty of monopoly, and wants to get back all his money invested in the islands.|`|UhKxohnxaa	First of all Philippines should open up to free market trade with Asia and Latin America which in turn will help create more jobs in Philippines.  <br>  Second:  Philippines should make sure they teach Spanish again as an official language so it will have more investments and trade with its cultural brothers this would create millions of jobs if the Government follows through on their promise
wr7YY4kJaa	From my experience it is usually fairly accurate. I have had a few that showed up one or two days past it but it has been rare. If you are very concerned you may want to call them and ask whether they ship it the same day or the next day after the order, if this is the case it should be there in 3-5 days.|`|dTenNrNraa	In 3-5 days<br>  It would only arrive later if there is an insane issue at the place it's manufactured or stored.
bru2xnlRaa	You will need to save money for the convention. <br>  <br>  Did you check Amtrak or Greyhound for tickets to Anaheim? There is bus service in the Anaheim area for transportation once you are there. <br>  Anaheim has lots of cheap hotels/motels. The home of Disneyland. <br>  <br>  Fast food is cheap. The grocery store is cheaper. Bring food from home in your backpack. Cheapest idea yet.<br>  <br>  How many days are you going to stay? Hotel costs could eat up your budget fast. Look into the YMCA or a Youth hostel.|`|QDP59FJ3aa	Ok no offense dude but $650 sounds pretty freaking good for a trip. If you cant afford $650 for a trip then i suggest you not taking it. And if you've already tried priceline.com and it came to $650 thats good.<br>  <br>  Go on priceline.com they book your flight and hotel together and really you get a good deal. <br>  <br>  Good LUCK!

Sorry.|`|SYPeab1Raa	She could get a job.  Then whatever company she's working for, could write her a letter of recommendation, and she could get a three year visa.  And if she's going to stay with you for more than 90 days, marriage could also be an option (just throwing it out there)  and she could get her visa renewed for good.

When you go solo, you can do what you want when you want and never have to compromise or negotiate with travel companions.  You don't have to share a bathroom, a TV, clothes hangers, or room safe, can sleep with the TV on all night if you like, etc.  You can easily meet people on board if you like, or ignor everybody.  Go for it, and have a blast!|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	Your chances of getting pushed overboard are very, very slim.  If you want to go alone, by all means do so.

j38AUPjOaa	1861 is the year of the first unification. In that year almost all the Nations composing the actual nation unificated creating the Reign of Italy, under Vittorio Emanuele II. The capital was Turin, and then Florence. In 1870 the Italian Army entered in Rome, enclosing in the Reign also the Papal States. And in this way Rome became our capital.|`|4055e33183e6b14a34d9ee25471e2761aa	It could have been long before that if it wasn't for the catholic church.

That year, for the first time in history a state called Kingdom of Italy was founded: the monarch was Vittorio Emanuele II, the chief of the government Camillo Cavour. The capital was Turin. That state comprised the most Northern Italy (without Veneto), the most central Italy (without Rome and Latium) and all the Southern Italy, Sicily and Sardinia.<br>  In 1870 Rome was added and became the capital, but Italy already existed.

I don;t know about you, moruboschiu, but there is no country that is doing good right now. AMERICA isnt doing that well either, just a thought. People are emigrating the US because of its poor system, and on top of that they have to pay for health care, and in itay you dont. Not even drugs. the price is negligable. It also depends where you live in italy, Sure some places are better than other. And there are many people who do well in italy also, and many people around the world that are doing very poorly DESPITE NOT BEING IN ITALY. Immigrants to the US are emigrating back to their home lands, and i don't know if the US will ever stand up again. So, Italy is not doing so bad as people say compared to the rest of the world. If your not convinced read some articles on yahoo finance.<br>  <br>  PS: Italy was the only country in the EU not to give money to their banks, as they were still able to stand, unlike all the failing banks around the world. Also, italy's advice from berlusconi helped the US banks in a recent meeting.

But that's ok. <br>  <br>    I lived there for almost 3 years and I have fond memories. Then again, we had access to the American base and still had the same items from the States.  We lived on the base, so we could go out into the citta and then come back home and it would be as if you were back in the States. You could immerse yourself into the culture as much as you wanted. Some chose not to, but we wanted to try all that Italy had to offer. <br>  <br>  I loved the scenery and loved traveling..The people were friendly. I got used to the driving. It was great for me, as I spent my days with my children, venturing out as much as possible.  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what type of job you are looking for. But a friend (yes, Italian) told me that the median salary range was about 1500-2500 euro/month. (*not sure if that's true or not, but to give you a general range)<br>  <br>  Of course it won't be easy, but if you really want to live there, try.<br>  <br>  I know several families that have said living abroad (3 years) is plenty for them and looked forward to moving back Stateside. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your job search there!|`|j38AUPjOaa	I'm italian, and I don't want to destroy your image of Italy but...<br>  <br>  You know, living in Italy in this period, especially in the big cities like Rome or Milan is really hard: we're covered of problems about money, job, security, opportunities...<br>  <br>  Just a pair of days ago i've read an interesting statistics: over 4 milion italians have left the country since 1994. 4 MILION!!! We're again an emigration country as at the beginning of the 20th century.<br>  <br>  And you know what? I envy who managed to go away. Deeply. I'd like to have the balls to do it too.<br>  <br>  All the world has this poetic image of Italy as a country of love, art and smiles. But the reality is different: we're a country with always more poor people, where a couple that gets married can't buy a good house becuase they're overpriced, where a graduated has to work in a call center with a 6 months contract for 800€ a month. Sometimes, on the italian Answers, i argue with someone saying "I'm proud to be italian". And my answer's always "WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU TO BE PROUD?????????". Here you still can find people thinking we're the best country in the world because of the Roman Empire, the Renaissance, the high fashion and the good cooking. And this makes me so angry. You can't understand how. Becuase it means that we'll always be a country full of ignorant scoundrels.<br>  <br>  So listen to me: if you want to try to come to live here, well... try it.<br>  <br>  But my suggestion is: keep your beautiful image of Italy in your heart, and come here whenever you want to visit our cities. They're beautiful, as you already knows. And our hospitality is known everywhere.<br>  <br>  But everyday reality is harder. A lot.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|GBr7TphLaa	I've been interested in visiting Italy ever since 4th grade (I'm in 10th now) and it's my favorite foreign country. It's really pretty there.  :)

fkqiEXCraa	germany i lived there for 14 years now i live in london... and like the other user said yes germany has more power.|`|gZLGhuVHaa	I have lived in both France and Germany as a student.     I find Germany much cleaner and organized.  The rents are nearly one half the cost as in France.   The food in Germany is very cheap considering the quality you get and they make very good pizza and ice cream in most major cities and in smaller towns, thanks to the hoard of immigrants from Southern Italy during the 60's and 70's.  They retained their culture and cuisine.   Military power, hmmm hard to say.    However for culture, there is no doubt that the French are far more cultured and well mannered than the Germans.   Culture is very much alive in both countries, but concerts, ballets, operas, etc. are much cheaper in Germany.   But France has among the world's most important Art Museums  and for fine dining there is no comparison.   It's actually a personal preference.   But if I were to choose, it would be Germany, since they make better draft beer,  tastier sausages and the best French  Fries (Pommes Frites) in the world. Besides, I am a fan of Richard Wagner's Music.  ;)|`|sJfJQ8e9aa	Germany has much more power than France and is the most cultural with the Castle's and the older building structures.|`|farAMKNpaa	Germany.Highly cultural and very powerful country.|`|a5IodNYVaa	france<br>  <br>  nice coast<br>  good food that wont give you a heart attack<br>  best health care in the world<br>  the "f you" attitude

There is nothing special about canberra except that it is the seat of government and a few memorials and statues.  If the government decided to move to Melbourne or Sydney, Canberra would probably turn in to a very boring place, as most people there are indirectly employed by the government.|`|2Fi3EmI8aa	Yeah - I'm from Canberra - but you have to realise is that there is only 350 000 people living in Canberra compared to the couple of million who live in Sydney or Melbourne, we are only relatively small.

First, teens can't buy alcoholic drinks, which is the big money maker for any club. Second, if teens are allowed into a club which serves alcohol, there's nothing stopping someone over 21 from buying drinks for the teen, and the liability increases exponentially from there. Possible outcomes of teen drinking are manifold, and the club operator could lose his license to serve alcohol (there goes the money thing again).<br>  <br>  Some of the coolest clubs are in some pretty dicey areas. I'm not yer daddy, but be careful out there! Here are a few places that have at least some nights that are 18+. Once again, be careful: These places may be frequented by jerks who just want to pick up some pretty young naive girls for their own pleasure. NEVER accept a drink you didn't see the bartender pour yourself. And it's a good idea to go with someone who has a car.

Carpets may be vacuumed every now and then but they are are rarely ever washed/cleaned on any proper schedule!  <br>  <br>  When you have a hotel room with tile on the floor the maids usually clean those floors more often because it doesn't take too long!<br>  <br>  Carpets can stink too!  Carpets pick up cigarette smells, toe jam smells, spots and stains from various fluids that just stay there from tenant to tenant.<br>  <br>  I have been in some lower priced (600-1200 baht) hotel rooms with carpeting and the carpets usually looked worn and ratty!   I never walk with my bare feet on a carpeted floor in a hotel - I wear cheap rubber flip flops in hotel rooms!

These budgets where posted online via contributions to the Costa Rica Living discussion group.  As you will see, there is a wide divide between what each contributor considers a comfortable lifestyle ... which of course, greatly effects the final 'cost of living'.<br>  <br>  ---------------------<br>  This is a budget for two people, living in 3 bedroom house in a mostly-safe San José neighborhood, enjoying a very nice, middle-class lifestyle. We shop at the feria (farmer's market) and have a housekeeper come in once weekly for 5 hours." -Erin (as posted 07/22/08 on Costa Rica Living)<br>  <br>  FYI:  The following costs were given in the Costa Rica currency of the colon.

Fixed costs for a 2 year old vehicle with full coverage car insurance were reported at ￠330.000 colónes for 6 months + the annual "marchamo" registration of ￠308.000 colónes.  Current gas costs for light local driving is approximated at ￠50.000 monthly and oil changes every 3,000 miles go for about ￠16.000 colónes.<br>  <br>  Grand Total - Costa Rica "Comfortable" Cost of Living with automobile & healthcare:  ￠646.000 (approx. $1,183.00/month)<br>   <br>  ---------------------<br>  "How about ... the upper middle end of middle class in Costa Rica? ... The budget below is for two people living in a 3 bed 3.5 bath home with a pool and Jacuzzi. I have not included entertainment outside the home ... I have however included "Legal expenses" in my budget. It is a fact that if you own anything in Costa Rica you are going to need a lawyer for everything...

My costs include private bilingual primary school for my son but exclude major purchases that are likely one-time or limited in reoccurrence such as household items, automobiles, etc. <br>  <br>  When you consider most native Costa Rica households 'comfortably' exist on $700 or less in total monthly income, you know those that are able to spend greater than $1,000/month are doing O.K.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bottom Line:  Costs of living continue to rise world wide, but there is no greater origin of the final costs than a person's individual lifestyle.  Happiness is choices and the ability to pay for them in the place that you want to live ;o)<br>  <br>  <br>  FINALLY:  Costa Rica actively encourages tourism and investment as these are both in its best interest.  Foreigners can visit and enjoy this beautiful country with a valid passport from most countries.  The passport entry stamp grants visitors 90 days to remain in-country as a tourist.  For those looking to move here full time, invest, Costa Rica laws allow foreigners to gain residency status if the person can prove they have independent sustainable income (ie: pension, social security, etc.) that meets minimum requirements. <br>  <br>  Kapn is absolutely correct in that these minimum income standards for Pensionado and Rentista residency status are currently in legislation for possible increases from $600/mo. to $2,000/mo. and $1,|`|6V78IwNCaa	Absolutely, Costa Rica is becoming more and more popular and prices for daily necessities have gone up.  If you avoid heavily touristy areas and trendy gringo retirement enclaves, $1300 would do you just fine.  In the Central Valley (the population center of Costa Rica) you never need to drive and it is easy to live in walking/ short taxi distance to everything you would do on a regular basis.  A basket of groceries is 1/3 the price of the US if you buy local goods and fresh produce.  Rent for a very nice condo or apartment is $200-$300 per month.  Property taxes are .25% of the assessed value.  A very nice home in the central valley is $150,000 so property taxes would be roughly $350 per year!

0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	There are only a few possibilities for obtaining a visa to live in Finland, and without citizenship with an EU country or direct Finnish ancestry, it's difficult to get one.<br>  <br>  Visa based on work: You need to have a job before you can apply to move to Finland and work there. Within the EU, a country must show they advertised a position locally and couldn't find a qualified EU worker, before they can hire you. It depends a lot on labor shortages within specific fields, and generally requires extensive higher education and work experience. Due to the time and cost involved, it makes more sense to hire a local.<br>  <br>  It's easy to get around Finland as a tourist using only English, but the working language for most companies is Finnish (or possibly Swedish). It's a necessity to speak one of those languages, otherwise finding work will be very difficult. With no particular skills or education, a company will always be able to find another applicant that can do the job, that speaks the local language in addition to English and can start work right away.<br>  <br>  The only other real possibility is a study visa. To be accepted to an undergrad program, you need to pass a fluency test in Finnish. You have to show you have at least €6000/year for support before you can get a permit. There are graduate programs in English, but you'll need a Bachelor's degree for entry. <br>  <br>  Your best option is to go to university in the US, and do a one-year exchange program without the language requirements (you would learn Finnish during that year). Alternately, you could do all your undergraduate studies in the US. It's important to start studying Finnish as soon as possible if you're serious about moving, it's listed as one of the most difficult languages to learn as an English-speaker. Once you've completed your degree, you could apply for graduate school in Finland. With an appropriate degree from Finland (and language skills, by then) you might have a possibility of finding work.|`|ksLn21Jfaa	You can literally move to any country and have the same problems/challenges ahead of you. Generally speaking finnish people do speak good English. Other problem is that they don't usually hire people with immigrant background that easily unless you have a magic skill that is hard to find. Getting a job is no easy task even for a Finn these days. Living in Helsinki area is more expensive than in the other towns so you'd probably end up having no money after all the expenses. Public transport, apartment rent, food are expensive and salaries relatively low and taxes high.  If you're not EU or finnish citizen your taxation rate is higher also. Let's not forget that we have comparably high unemployment rate which is officially 7% but don't be fooled by that. If the only factor was paid jobs it'd be about 14 %. <br>  <br>  If you really want to try then I suggest that you try to get some kind of temporary summer job and apply for the temporary working visa permit. There are American companies in Finland aswell but usually they don't hire much staff as it is more economical to employ people elsewhere.<br>  <br>  You'd have more luck in some English speaking country. (UK & Ireland)|`|fkqiEXCraa	people in helsinki speak fluent english.  but if u go to the outer skirts of town like  espoo. prepare yourself cause people there dont talk english that much and u might have a hard time communicating with them.|`|a5IodNYVaa	work would be very difficult without speaking Suomi. unless your work doesnt require talking with customers.|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Well, the other answerer is totally wrong with the English skills of Finns, namely, English is the primary choice for the first (compulsory!) foreign language at school across the whole country so we Finns certainly know our English (except people older than 60 years of age)!!! But, the problem is that to have a Finnish citizenship requires a passing of a language test, which means that you cannot have the citizenship without any Finnish skills here. The universities here do not offer whole degree programmes in English so that is another problem too.

If you were in the tower room you have to walk through the lobby and across the alley to get to the pool, It is the older part but I like it. No tub but a shower and if you are tall you have to lean down to get under it because it is so low on the wall.

CuYQ57mjaa	I doubt that global financial crisis has any effect on the public utility drivers; but certainly would believe the effects caused by the rising prices of fuel.  Most of these drivers are paid by boundaries and consumption of fuel is their only main concern.  As you know, maintenance expenses are shouldered by the operators. <br>  <br>  With the current mass layoffs and cost cutting of businesses, people tend to use the most cheap and effective transport system available.|`|KVlRYoidaa	everybody is affected by this crisis|`|eDjiOWKtaa	this may sound strange but i don't think it affects them as much as everyone else.<br>  <br>  jeepneys, buses, and fx's are the only means of public transportation that requires a driver and yet their operator's fares took almost forever to go down when the price of oil bursted. it's not as if people will ride a bicycle, walk, or go road-skiing from the back to go places because public transportation is a necessity... unless if millions here lost their jobs and wouldn't need to travel at all... that's when the drivers will be greatly affected. i don't think its reached that number just yet.|`|lemCTR2Waa	Maybe not as much as the industrialized countries are experiencing. However because many people are laid off from work and some have part time jobs now, less people are traveling to work, so that somehow would lessen the drivers' earnings.|`|6e3e13dad52401635f135a72ce217f23aa	Not only the public drivers were affected with the global financial crisis most of the people from government and private sectors become affected it's just that Filipinos seems very productive for their needs specialy for the family.|`|PgvwnEpMaa	it affects everybody. if people dont have jobs they dont leave house and jeepneys wont have passengers.|`|FBAmSYKKaa	Yes, like most countries, even the Philippines is affected by the present global crisis. There are many industries and businesses who are down-sizing the number of their personnel just so they can stay afloat or remain in business. Others have taken the extreme measure of closing their operations. <br>  <br>  In the case of drivers of public transportation, specially the taxis, jeepneys and buses, most drivers are already complaining that they cannot meet their "boundaries", the payment they give to owners of the vehicles which they hire for the day to do business. There are less people taking the public transport. It is a good thing that the price of oil has gone down globally so the fares the drivers are collecting from passengers have also gone down.

If you call them and ask them, or if they say online that there are no hidden fees(and usually they say it outright so they can get your business, but are not going to scam you in the end) then there won't be. $450 per person for that length of trip is not bad at all. Another way to cut down on costs is to find a place that will serve you free breakfast in the morning, and if you're bringing a ton of kids, have one person bring them in one or two at a time so you're not paying the extra bulls**t cost per person. They won't care if you've got small kids anyways. Hope it helps, and have fun on your trip.

EjhJliKmaa	REYNALDO A. VILLAR<br>  <br>  Chairman Reynaldo A. Villar is named the seventh chairman of the Philippine Commission on Audit (COA) after his appointment was confirmed by the powerful Commission on Appointments on June 11, 2008. He filled the post vacated by Chairman Guillermo N. Carague, whose term ended on February 2, 2008.<br>  <br>  Filling a post he so well deserved, Chairman Villar has been with the Commission for 20 years. He rose from the ranks, first joining COA in 1988 as Staff Officer II, and a year later was promoted to Human Resource Management Officer V. On March 8, 1996 he accepted an appointment as Department Legislative Liaison Officer (DLLO) coterminous with then COA Chairman Celso D. Gangan. Realizing the importance of an officer that would provide regular linkage to and coordination with the Philippine Congress, COA converted the DLLO position to a regular position, with the rank of Assistant Commissioner, and Villar retained the post until his appointment as COA Commissioner by the President of the Republic of the Philippines on September 23, 2004 for a term expiring on February 2, 2011.<br>  <br>  As Commissioner, he participated actively in the promulgation of COA decisions and policies. He has represented COA in meetings of the United Nations Board of Auditors (UNBOA), of which COA is a member. He participated in the 59th Regular Session of UNBOA held in New York in 2005. In 2006 he represented COA in three separate events organized by UNBOA: the 4th Regular Session, Panel of External Auditors of the United Nations; the 22nd Meeting with the Technical Group, Panel of External Auditors of the United Nations; and Special Session. Among the recent seminars and conferences he has attended are the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) Industrial Development Board (IDB) Conference held in June 2005 in Vienna, Austria and the seminar on Corporate Governance for Philippine Banks, conducted in January 2007 by the Bankers Institute of the Philippines.<br>  <br>  Chairman Villar is an advocate of good governance. He exhorts everyone to uphold integrity in the workplace. His commitment to the anti-corruption programs of the government made him a member of the Multi-Sectoral Anti-Corruption Council (MSACC). The MSACC has been described as the "convergence of the brightest and dedicated individuals from various sectors of (Philippine) society." It is headed by the Ombudsman and has 30 members representing various sectors: Executive Department, Senate, House of Representatives, Judiciary, Constitutional Bodies, Local Government, Academe, Youth, Civil Society Groups, Business, Media, Religious Groups, Government Financing Institutions, and the Donor Community. The MSACC serves as a consultative and coordinating body for the National Anti-Corruption Program of Action (NACPA), which aims to serve as an effective mechanism for consultation and coordination among key anti-corruption stakeholders and to strengthen the anti-corruption commitments of the government and non-government sectors.<br>  <br>  He is very keen in improving the system and policies of the Commission towards the attainment of its mandate effectively and efficiently. He promotes participative management and is receptive to suggestions and criticisms and esteemed for demonstrating objectivity and fairness in the implementation of policies and guidelines based on the Constitution and applicable laws.<br>  <br>  Another important undertaking in which Chairman Villar is presently involved is the Integrity Development Review (IDR) of key public sector agencies. This activity was initiated by the Department of Budget and Management and the Office of the Ombudsman. COA is a member of IDR’s Advisory Group. IDR aims to examine an agency's practices and procedures for their vulnerability to corruption with a view to preventing corruption before it occurs.<br>  <br>  The new Chairman completed his grade school and secondary courses at the Ateneo de Manila University, where he also obtained his Bachelor of Arts major in Political Science and Bachelor of Laws degrees in 1963 and 1967, respectively. He was admitted to the Philippine Bar the following year. His first stint as a full-fledged lawyer was as Legal Assistant to the Provincial Governor of Pangasinan in 1968 and later as Technical Assistant to the General Manager of the Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration. From 1971 to 1973 he was elected delegate to the Constitutional Convention that amended the Philippine Constitution. He was later elected as Floor Leader of that convention. In 1980 he was elected as Board Member of the Provincial Government of Pangasinan. He was also a professor of constitutional law at the Ateneo College of Law in 1982.<br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Comm. Juanito G. Espino, Jr.<br>   <br>  <br>  Commissioner JUANITO G.

9tC8zz5Zaa	yes it was.|`|hKP5sQewaa	Yes<br>  It never broke apart from Great Britain (Great Britain being the English Scottish and Welsh mainland,  The biggest Island, that's why its called great because its the greatest (biggist) island in Britain) But during the melting of the ice caps, sea levels begun to rise which caused Ireland to become a island and detached from land from Great Britain, also, Great Britain, from the south of England, used to be joined to France by dry land about 8 thousands years ago if i remember right, But then sea levels rose and caused the land in what is now the English Chanel to be flooded and is now the English Chanel, separating Great Britain from France. :]<br>  <br>  The reason why i say great Britain rather then the UK is because the UK refers to Northern Ireland too, and Northern Ireland is attached to the Republic of Ireland, and is a separate island from Great Britain. :]<br>  <br>  Hope i helped :]|`|7b6d9b71ec244bad6e5e7cd334ec64e6aa	Based on the shape of ireland it is quite likely that at one time the lands were connected but this would have been millions of years ago.|`|zijhBbBaaa	Yes x|`|30e9927658a61352d780b8717406445daa	Ireland was part of the UK before 1922.

2UomwjfEaa	Cape Town to Johannesburg takes around 14 hours by car. One could also go by bus which would be slower. The train is another option and this takes really long. One could fly, this would be around 2 hours.<br>  <br>  Someone mentioned that the speed limit is 120 but as long as you keep your eyes open for speed traps yu can safely travel along quite a lot faster on the highways, just stay under 180 as then you will be facing an arrest warrant and not just a speeding fine.|`|St6HeoF8aa	The maximum speed limit in South Africa is 120km/h.

Its a 5 minute walk from Glasgow Central Train Station and from their you can get a train to "Mount Florida" Station and from there is a 2 minute walk to Hampden Stadium.

ssGQsRJWaa	I live in Salford you have a Number of Options.Firstly its Nowhere near the Shopping Centre.Its in Salford Quays...Pier8, Your best Option which Many use is to Travel to Eccles in Salford [That is on the Map] The First Tram stop from Eccles is Ladywell,There is a Large Park and Ride, Vast Numbers of People use it When Manchester United play at Home. Park Safely there and Hop the Tram to "Harbour City" Tram Stop, Its a Fairly short distance. You cannot miss the Theatre When you get off the Tram.You can Also Travel to the Centre of Manchester...Park up then Travel from Piccadilly Tram station on the Eccles Line and get off at Harbour City. This way is a Longer Journey on the Tram.....Hope this Helps!|`|b8e002cc5b802e1aa15d64b7ce269beeaa	been there, walking distance from the lowry shopping mall, car park and believe that there is a tram too!!<br>  <br>  this is the lowry postcode   M50 3AZ if you want to find on a map|`|PY1glujMaa	The answer is yes and there is a very good car park there.

3RcIrWvpaa	Hi and thanks for answering my question, so here I am to give you advice from what I know =]<br>  <br>  Flight Centre does NOT have a catch, they simply want your business. <br>  <br>  If you are willing to spend time to look online, you will usually find a cheaper flight!  So look on multiple websites, I suggest start by searching "flight" or "cheap flight" on google.com.au. <br>  Print out the cheapest flight, take it to Flight Centre and ensure that they give you the 10% cheaper price. (I remember there were some rules, which you can check on their website. something about the flight needed to be from a NZ business, as I went to an NZ Flight Centre).<br>  <br>  I don't know of discounts for students.<br>  <br>  I don't think the price will go down,<br>  but I do know there are periods of flight sales between Aus and NZ... I don't know when they come on so it's a bit of a gamble as far as I know. See if online researching will get you a flight a lot cheaper than $560. <br>  Seems to me $390 was definately down the low-end of Brisbane-Auckland return fares.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|RZKTRn8Qaa	I'm not sure about catches with Flight Centre etc., but it's generally cheaper to book yourself online, instead of through an agent. Agents charge comission, so it'd be easier to do it yourself.<br>  <br>  The longer you leave it, the more expensive it will get, so book ASAP.<br>  <br>  Students may not get a discount. I think that once you turn 16 you are usually charged as an adult. It depends on the airline you travel by. For example, Air NZ charges you as an adult once you turn 12.<br>  <br>  I just checked Air NZ's site, and the fare is $138AUD each way for the dates you plan on going.
mP8ILrC4aa	you can go to their website and it tells you the amounts of liquids. they have to be under 100 ml and in a plastic ziplock bag<br>  also royal air maroc has weight limits on their checked bagage so make sure you keep your bags lightweight.<br>  keep any medicine in a seperate ziplock bag and be ready to pull both bags out of your carryone when seached by security. its not that bad as long as you remember keep the liquids under 100ml and keep them in a plastic bag....this is for your carry on...you can put the big liquids in your checked bags|`|kmh6Slzfaa	When flying from England, I have my carry on luggage checked for liquids and if more than 100mL it is confiscated.<br>  Going from Morocco is not as strict as flying in and no-one checks hand luggage - not even for liquids.

Once we were on the plane we were not required to sit in our assigned seats and people were laying across them like benches sleeping. All of the kids were playing in the front of the plane. The flights attendants brought us the food once after that they just sat in the back. There was all you can drink alcohol for free. The flight attendants sat in the back and left the fridge open and let us drink as much as we wanted. It was a fun flight mine was 7 hrs from casa to jfk. They are not strict at all you can bring liquids on the plane. They are not crazy like american flights were they are strict.
tA1ztvXaaa	Yes I stayed there on vacation, the staff particularly front desk personnel, some not all (women) are so catty and rude.  They seemed one or two of them but management was quite hospitable.  They go at the pace of the people down south very slow, and seem to be in their own world.  Not much to do that except gamble which i did.  <br>  <br>  It's a 10-15 minute bus ride from down town, where all the better resturarants and shops are but bus services stops i think at six or seven.  I went to the FISH FRY every night for food it was so much better only thing is LOCAL men are gross, they have no class, very aggressive, no respect I mean generally men make cat calls at women but these guys are EXTREME and the police officers are not much different.  I found this quite disturbing since, this country's main income is tourism and tourist have to be subjected to such cantankerous behavior.  I lived in the Bahamas until i was a teenager then moved to the US it was a little disappointing but with regard to the hotel, it's quiet and nice not bad for the money, especially if you're looking to relax.

It's not a five star resort and you get what you pay for.

Personally, I would not want to live there in the long term. It is very much a small college town and there is not a lot to do there. I found it kind of boring- of course I am from a large city, and I am not used to such a small town. So I guess it all depends on what you are looking for.  I haven't been there for about 8 years, so I don't know if it has changed much since then.<br>   That being said, I love living in Missouri.

oUqLwOYFaa	There are so many great places to visit in the west and southwest that it's hard to make a decision. It really depends on whether you're interested in seeing deserts or mountains, being the beach or being in an urban area or what. <br>  <br>  However, I would say that a great trip that provides for a lot of opportunities to take good pictures would be a road trip through Arizona. There are so many cool things to see here - The Grand Canyon, of course, and the smaller Canyon de Chelly for starters. Then there are the red rocks of Sedona, the forests of Flagstaff and the cultural landmarks in Tucson.<br>  <br>  Tucson and Phoenix should both have different college-related stuff going on so if you're interested in hitting up the bar scene and other urban stuff like that then you'll still have the opportunity to do that with a Spring Break vacation in the state.<br>  <br>  Of course, there are other great Spring Break destinations in the West and Southwest. San Diego is a good one if you're looking for a beach vacation with a lot going on and you want to stick to one city. San Francisco is terrific if you're looking for lots to do since there are tons of theatre and arts events always happening here in March. I'd say figure out specifically what you want to see and photograph and plan around that.|`|6t76bgS3aa	I've had fun in Lake Havasu and Palm Springs, there's pretty scenery and lots of hot girls and drinking ... unless you're Mormon, then you might not like it|`|40527ad60966d944ca757e8d6d1c6c28aa	The Pin-Up Show in May is a fundraising celebration of art in the raw in which Northern Arizona artists are invited to show and sell their artwork.  sedonaartscenter.com<br>  <br>  Sedona, Arizone is a beautiful place to photograph and the Pin-Up show is facinating.

F32uPjAraa	The Bhopal gas tragedy that took place in 1984 resulted in more than 22000 deaths till now and various genetic diseases among newly born. Union Carbide was the company responsible for this unforgivable disaster. The link below is a good place to start if you are interested. <br>  <br>  Introduction Around 1 a.m. on Monday, the 3rd of December, 1984, in a densely populated region in the city of Bhopal, Central India, a poisonous vapour burst from the tall stacks of the Union Carbide pesticide plant. This vapour was a highly toxic cloud of methyl isocyanate. Of the 800,000 people living in Bhopal at the time, 2,000 died immediately, and as many as 300,000 were injured. In addition, about 7,000 animals were injured, of which about one thousand were killed. “A series of studies made five years later showed that many of the survivors were still suffering from one or several of the following ailments: partial or complete blindness, gastrointestinal disorders, impaired immune systems, post traumatic stress disorders, and menstrual problems in women. A rise in spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and offspring with genetic defects was also noted.” (The Bhopal Disaster) This incident we now refer to as the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, which has also been called “Hiroshima of the Chemical Industry” one of the worst commercial industrial disasters in history.(Cohen) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hu.mtu.edu/hu_dept/tc@mtu/papers/bhopal.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hu.mtu.edu/hu_dept/tc@mtu/pap...</a>|`|y8qLvHwTaa	The Bhopal gas tragedy remains a live issue 23 years after toxic gases leaked out of a Union Carbide plant in December 1984. Recent developments indicate a desire on the part of the government to put an end to it. A series of reports looks at these developments and the continuing presence of 9,000 tonnes of toxic waste on the premises of the plant.<br>  <a href="http://www.indiahotelview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiahotelview.com</a>
mzIEfCYQaa	RELAX!<br>  <br>  Check in ONLINE, even if you don't have a printer to print your tickets.  Most airlines allow you to do this up to 24 hrs prior to your flight.<br>  <br>  Arrive to the airport EARLY: I recommend arriving to the airport at least 1 hour prior to your departing time and I don't mean be in the parking lot looking for either a place to park or circling the airport looking for where you should be going. <br>  <br>  Check Luggage: <br>  There are two places to check luggage.  Outside at the desk (make sure you're at the right airline desk)  and the desk inside (again, make sure it's the airline you're fling with). Make sure you go to the right desk.  If you're flying AMERICAN AIRLINES, you'll need to go to their desk.  If you're flying DELTA AIRLINES you'll need to go to their desk... etc. <br>  <br>  If you're checking luggage make sure you check everything that can't go in your carryon luggage. I recommend a small back pack with a magazine or book, maybe snack food of some sort.  Don't take anything liquid unless you plan on drinking it PRIOR to going through the security checkpoint.  Some people don't take a carryon at all, and that's cool, but I always take a book so if the flight doesn't leave on time I'm not in the expensive stores looking for something to read.<br>  <br>  Okay, so once you have checked your luggage make sure you get your ticket to get on the flight.  Sometimes you can print this out before you get to the airport.. but if you don't have it already, don't leave this location without it!!<br>  <br>  Then, make your way to Security.  (Most people will be going this way/direction... so just follow the crowd).  Make sure you have your photo ID and ticket IN HAND (don't put it away and make ppl wait behind you).  Be prepared to remove all electronics from your carry on bag and place them into a grey box for security to x-ray. You may need two or three grey boxes (provided at the security checkpoint), depending on if you're carrying with you a laptop (1 box) , phone & dvd-player, etc. (1 box) and then your bag with non electrical items inside it you can leave IN the bag, and place in yet another box. Depending on the airport, you will probably be asked (not that it's an option) to remove your shoes and place them on the conveyor belt to be x-rayed too.  <br>  <br>  I don't recommend putting elecronics in luggage you check.  The baggage handlers are rough with checked luggage and if you do this, you'll be kicking yourself in the butt when you get to where you're going and your DVD player or laptop no longer works. <br>  <br>  Once you're done there.. you'll get through the metal detector, and gather your crap and MOVE, get out of the way and sort your stuff back into your bags and start looking for signs that say the airline you're flying, then head that direction.  You may get on a little airport tram inside or you may have a long walk / run ahead of you (give yourself plenty of time).  Once you're in the Delta (or the airline you're flying with) area, look for which gate you should be near.  You can always ask people if you're in the right area, but you're probably better off asking someone who works there.<br>  <br>  Wow, that was a lot... but it's pretty detailed.  Relax, don't get rushed and by all means... Don't forget your ID or the airline you're flying with!!<br>  Good Luck!|`|2ef9de5a6d07c56b24d8e40822fb7f15aa	Your worst time will be in the terminal waiting and processing. take my word.|`|QdYiF0f6aa	Just make sure that you don't have any creams or fluids in your carry-on.  Or if you must, then put them in a quart-size zip lock bag and everything in it must be 3 oz. or less (each).  So if you bring astringent, perfume, or face wash, just transfer them into small bottles that indicate that they are 3oz. (a new rule just came out that the bottles must be labeled that their capacity is indeed only 3oz.<br>  <br>  Just to make sure, I put anything that i need that is fluid or creamy in that ziplock such as lipstick etc.., and if they don't fit, then they go in my check-in luggage.<br>  <br>  everytime you go through security check, they require that the ziplock is out the bag and in your hand and placed in those baskets with your phone and other metallic objects.  if you're wearing a jacket, it must also be removed and placed in that basket that goes through xray. samething with laptops.<br>  <br>  Process is always, -boardpass and passport check when you're in the airport.<br>  <br>  -pay whatever travel or terminal fees you have to pay if it's not already paid for when you got your ticket.<br>  <br>  -get inline for check-in. when at check-in counter, they will weigh your luggage and make sure that everything is in their weight limit. They will also ask if anybody asked you to bring luggage for them, and if you did, do you know the content of their package.  Just to be sure, don't accept anything from other people if you don't know what's in that package.<br>  <br>  - after that you have to go through immigration, where they will check your passport and boarding pass. maybe they'll ask a few questions.<br>  <br>  -after that's it's to your gate. but before you get to the gate they also do a little security check.

We have a joke of an army, with no navy and no air force! If it did ever come to war it would be Britain and the EU that would protect us. Our neutrality is a joke.

They also have some clothing stores down there (that don't have Disney designs on them).  <br>  <br>  You might also check to see if you can use the gift card in a dining resturant.  Maybe use it to go to one of the nice resturants there.  Epcot has a lot of great ones, although I don't recomend Mexico.  Germany, Canada, The Garden Grill, and the one at the Living Sea's are all great. <br>  <br>  It will go faster than you think, so enjoy!|`|kJdpjLKeaa	What about a Mickey watch? Those are thirty bucks. I also got a really nice snowglobe and a picture frame. There are also some CD's of the theme park music, like ragtime if you like that sort of thing if you want some tacky souvenir but want something with Disneylook, they have understated Tinkerbell braclets or simple necklaces. 150 is a good amount of money if you know what you want to get beforehand.|`|nlRr07dRaa	it's all junk, and $150 will go quick in disney. they do have some picture frames best of all the memories. get an autograph book and a good pen take pictures as you get all the autographs of your favorite characters, and put them all in your autograph picture book. it will bring back memories for years to come!|`|AvYlPRltaa	Buy stuff that you like whether its figurines or candy you should just get something that represents you.

AIr regulations require that the cabin crew inform you of emergency procedures, the locations of exits, how and when to fasten your seat belts, and so on, but the exact wording is up to the airline (and sometimes up to the crew, in cases where the crew explains things in person—although now prepared video presentations often replace the live explanation from flight attendants). As long as they provide you with the information you need by law, they can express it any way they want.<br>  <br>  In the past, when live explanations were common, some crews on some airlines were very imaginative in making the presentations more interesting. With prerecorded video, that is less so today, although some airlines, such as Virgin America, have cute videos.

I've seen UM's (Unaccompanied Minors) arrive a lot at international airports. These youngsters are generally old enough to take care of themselves, though I have seen some very young children flying alone.<br>  <br>  You need a passport. If your parent/guardian has the ability and inclination to get you a passport, I think you can go. Might be good to do this- check with the airline you plan to use. See what their policy is on minors traveling alone. I believe that under 14 the aircrew will keep an eye on you and someone from the airline will accompany you through Customs. I've also seen groups traveling together where there are a few adults traveling with a school group. The airlines allow the adults to monitor the minors.<br>  <br>  And don't forget post 9/11 security. Whoever is in charge of you may not be allowed into the secure area after check-in, so this might also require some coordination with the airline.|`|g4rck9Neaa	American carriers and domestic flights are much easier to deal with.

VxfyQZ2jaa	Welcome!<br>  <br>  The city stays green all year most years as the temperature rarely goes below freezing and it almost never snows. Late October to early May tends to be very nice.  We pay for the nice winters with hot, humid summers (especially July/August). Most colleges start in August so you will get the end of the suummer, but the weather will improve by September.  Note that it is still hot enough in September to go to the beaches in NW Florida on weekends.<br>  <br>  New Orleans made the news since Katrina because drug dealers returning to the city have been fighting over turf and the competition is literally deadly. The reduced population made the "rate" (rate = population divided by crimes) go through the roof. Also, the Census Bureau recently announced their 2006 post-Katrina population estimate was grossly too low, which further increased the "rate". However, almost 98% of serious violent crime in New Orleans happens within the illegal drug community (mainly crack cocaine) and the other 2% are "domestic" homicides. That does NOT make the crimes OK, but the average resident or visitor doesn't have to worry about it. Other crime in New Orleans is at or below the national average, and all one needs to be safe is to use the same basic common sense required in every city in the world.<br>  <br>  New Orleans is one of the world's special places, even after its near-destruction by Katrina. I hope you enjoy your time in NOLA!<br>  <br>  Things to do in New Orleans:<br>  <br>  Mardi Gras and the Jazz Festival are world famous events, but New Orleans hosts many festivals and celebrations throughout the year:  www.nola.com/festivals<br>  <br>  The Saint Charles Streetcar is the oldest continuously operating street railway in the world and is a "tourist attraction" in its own right.  It is part of the public transit system, as are the Canal Street and Riverfront streetcar lines:  www.norta.com<br>  <br>  There is always music, but the bands change: Go to www.bestofneworleans.com and click on Music then Listings or to www.offbeat.com and click on Listings, then Music. <br>  <br>  Note that music clubs often advertise "No Cover", meaning there is no charge for entering. However, clubs with "No Cover" often require that customers buy a beverage each for every "set " of music (which can be every 20 minutes) so KNOW THE PRICE before you sit down. Clubs do that because some people will sit in the club all evening drinking nothing (clubs only make money from the drinks they sell - not from the music). It is also a good idea to pay for each round of drinks (in clubs on Bourbon Street) as it is delivered so there can't be any confusion at the end of the evening.<br>  <br>  An incomplete guide to bars & clubs:   www.neworleanscheapdrinks.com<br>  <br>  About certain alcoholic beverages:  Realize that some famous drinks are VERY potent compared with regular cocktails that have only 1 to 1 ? ounces of alcohol. For example, a Hurricane is basically 3 or 4 ounces of rum in something like red Kool-Aid, and a Hand Grenade has at least 4 ? ounces of Everclear + rum + vodka mixed with melon liquor.  They don’t necessarily taste like an alcoholic beverage and it is easy to over-indulge.<br>  <br>  Wander around the French Quarter, enjoy the architecture, watch the street entertainers (do tip), and visit some of the historic buildings that have been turned into museums (go to www.frenchquarter.com and click on Historic Attractions).<br>  <br>  Assuming the weather is good, you can collect a sandwich lunch and eat in the riverfront park (watch the shipping) or in Jackson Square (a very nice park). <br>  <br>  The Riverwalk shopping center has an air-conditioned food court with dining overlooking the river (www.riverwalkmarketplace.com).  The Canal Place shopping center is in the French Quarter and has a cinema and higher-end shopping (Saks 5th Avenue, Brooks Brothers, etc.).  Magazine Street is a miles-long shopping district: www.magazinestreet.com<br>  <br>  Louisiana is the only US state that offers tax-free shopping for international visitors:  <a href="http://www.louisianataxfree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.louisianataxfree.com/</a><br>  <br>  The lobby for the Westin Canal Place Hotel is on the 11th floor and overlooks the French Quarter. It is a great place for an afternoon drink/snack:(www.westin.com).<br>  <br>  Cafe du Monde is in the French Quarter and you shouldn't miss having cafe au lait & beignets (www.cafedumonde.com). Another great coffee shop is the Croissant d'Or (at 615 Ursulines Street), which is open from 7:00am to 2:00pm and has food in addition to pastry. <br>  <br>  The Palm Court restaurant is very nice, has moderate prices, and offers traditional live jazz starting at 8:00pm: 1204 Decatur Street, tel 504-525-0200 (reservations are important and they are not open every day). The Palm Court is closed from about July 25th to about September 25th each year.<br>  <br>  Maximo's Italian Grill has great food and atmosphere: 1117 Decatur Street in the French Quarter, (504) 586-8883.<br>  <br>  All of the famous restaurants (Antoine's, Arnaud's, Brennan's, Commander's Palace, etc.) have reopened. The Pelican Club (on Exchange Alley in the FQ) is not as well known but is the same type experience. Reservations are a good idea, and probably essential on weekends.  Tujaques Restaurant (823 Decatur Street) is very traditional and has moderate prices:  www.tujaguesrestaurant.com<br>  <br>  Cafe Degas is a very French restaurant near City Park at 3127 Esplanade - which is not within walking distance of downtown (5 to 10 minutes by taxi). They are closed on Mondays & Tuesdays (504-945-5635).<br>  <br>  The Napoleon House restaurant is at 500 Chartres Street in the FQ, and has a menu of great local dishes:  www.napoleonhouse.com<br>  <br>  Preservation Hall has traditional live Jazz, and doesn’t serve alcohol so all ages are welcome:  www.preservationhall.com<br>  <br>  New Orleans has ballet, opera, a symphony orchestra, and theatre: <br>  <br>  www.nobadance.com<br>  www.neworleansopera.org<br>  www.lpomusic.com<br>  www.lepetittheatre.com<br>  <br>  There is a free ferry across the Mississippi at the "foot" of Canal Street. It is a short trip but like a harbor cruise w/o a guide: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canal_street_ferry" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/canal_stree...</a><br>  <br>  The Aquarium, Audubon Zoo, and the new Insectarium are world-class attractions (www.auduboninstitute.org) and you should see them if you can. The Zoo is several miles from downtown. You can drive to the Zoo (which has free parking) or take public transit from the French Quarter.<br>  <br>  The Louisiana State Museum is in the French Quarter:  <a href="http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/" rel="nofollow">http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/</a>  New Orleans is also home to a number of other museums, such as the National World War II Museum (www.ddaymuseum.org) and the New Orleans Museum of Art (www.noma.org).

Temperature is in the 70's today at my home; I'm sure it's around the same in N.O.  For the most part, the weather is hot and humid.  You'll be able to wear shorts, or at least jeans and tee shirts (no jackets) for the most part of fall/winter.  Winter is very mild.  And short.  For a small part we (lower part of the state) have temps. in the 20's or 30's, but for the most part, winter is very mild.  It DID happen to snow in New Orleans last December (my dad works there), but for the most part we have snowless winters.<br>  <br>  I haven't been there lately, but the city has so many different food, musical, and shopping experiences, that it's hard to describe them all.  Also, I never lived in the city, have only seen it as a visitor, but hopefully I've helped you a little with the weather part.<br>  <br>  About the crime:  Haven't been there in a while, but know several people who have moved away at least in part because of the increase in crime rates.  I think there were a couple shootings last week, but it WAS Mardi Gras, and were a lot more people in the city than normal.  I really don't know.|`|xbGgF6dLaa	In Louisiana, its humid. I can't believe its snowing! It is like so hot down here! You can start feeling the heat come in like february. It USUALLY does not snow here(though it did in december. me and my sister were so excited!) it will be hot. In LA it can be almost freezing then 75 degrees the next day so be careful not to get sick.|`|ymt018uhaa	Expect weather that constantly changes sporadically. It'll be freezing cold one day, but hot the next. A couple of weekends ago, in one day it went from chilly and windy, to raining,  to really hot. We hardly have a winter here - it mostly stays warm.|`|HgfIn4LTaa	In the NW? anywhere near East King County? It is snowing, and a far cry from New Orleans weather. Hot muggy but sunny! Full of thunder and lightening storms. Huge raindrops. But when it gets cold it is like the chill we feel right before the snow, it goes right through you.<br>  <br>  I went to UNO, moved from St Bernard La back in 1989 and thought all it did was rain in the northwest that and slugs. The climate down south is perfect for mosquitoes, and roaches like it too. Now for humans. I found that if you eat a lot of red meat or drink red wine you sweat more, a factor could be New Orleans is below sea level, so stay with your healthy NW diet. <br>  <br>  Daquiries are sweet and cold, very cold, better than beer to keep cool. Beer is wheat or hops-the carbs will keep you warm when you are trying to cool down. It will be easier to 'climatize' by thinning your blood out before you go, you may need to wear a  lot more layers up here to do so, but it is well worth it, and guest I bring down there, appreciate that advice too. <br>  My dresser went from 5 draws of shirts and shorts and one for 'cool' weather' to 5 draws of hoodies and jeans and a drawer I use only from July-September up here. <br>  <br>  Down there, It gets humid, it gets very humid! If you are prone to sinus infections or colds you will have your fair share of them. Each year I visit I take airborne before I leave and for the duration there, hint, hint. Stay away from black clothing, you will only trap the heat more.<br>  <br>  Now for the crime, it is murder capital. I have a family member who is a police officer down there, and I am always fearing for her safety, NOPD gets a bad rap from those that are on the wrong side of the law.<br>  Don't be a statistic, don't be stupid and think you are invincible(liquid courage), they put up with alot. Keep your valuables in your front pockets and don't think guys (or girls) are rubbing up against you because they like you, pickpockets are everywhere.<br>  <br>  French Quarter is the bomb! You will have so much fun! You will learn to have 'french quarter' shoes. Comfortable and stylish enough to walk or dance for a long time without the thought of who is going to spill something on them this night?  (And the dance clubs are awesome!!)<br>  p.s., glass bottles are not allowed in the quarter, but walking everywhere with a drink in your hand may come natural way sooner than you think.<br>  I love the NW because we are honestly friendly and I love that I am a part of this culture and have been for 20 years. It will be hard to find places like this anywhere, and by going to New Orleans, you will appreciate it even more. <br>  I would love to hear how you like it down there, keep in touch!|`|COOzle6Saa	its ridiculously humid. seriously, you go outside and your like wet. its pretty gross. but sometimes its not that bad. snowing happens hardly ever so im sure thats good news for you. =]  the warm weather is okay, except for the fact that is hot and humid. not just hot. so that kind of sucks. then you have times whens its hot and then cold in the matter of hours, which gets kind of annoying. <br>  also nola is cool i guess, i mean its no new york. hah but theres def some cool things to do here. <br>  my fav:<br>  shopping on magazine street.<br>  beignets are good, but extremely fattening. so dont eat them often =]<br>  french quarter.<br>  uptown. st charles streetcar is fun. <br>  the zoo is very nice. the aquarium, eh not so much. but check out the zoo. ha<br>  uhhm and think outside the box by going to metairie/kenner area or westbank. bc even though its not technically in NO, there are still great places to go eat, see!<br>  <br>  also the crime is not THAT bad. i mean be careful where you go. once you are here, you will soon realize where to go and not to go at night and stuff. the frenchquarter is pretty safe, i say pretty bc there was a murder their recently. sorry. but dont worry about that. haha you'll be fine.<br>  what college are you going to?<br>  good luck with everything|`|AA10784062	Here is a website that keeps track of the crime situation here:<br>  <a href="http://www.nocrimeline.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nocrimeline.com/</a><br>  <br>  The highs today were in the lower 80's, but just last week we were all wearing jackets and sweaters.  Once spring settles in for the durations, it will be hot and muggy.  during the summer months, expect highs in the 90's and humidity at 80 to 100%.  Hot and damp.

AA10192646	Depends on two things: how my baggage will go through between flights; and what about accomodation in the stops.<br>  <br>  In regard to bags, can they be booked all the way to the end of your trip? Or, do you have to recheck them again?<br>  <br>  In regard to accomodation, will the airline provide accomodation in layovers? Or, do you have to get your own accomodation? And if you have to manage that yourself, how much will it cost (with ground transportation) and is it worth the difference in ticket fare?!!<br>  <br>  You think it over!!|`|VzRQkM8Jaa	Hey<br>  <br>  The first option.

It has a LITTLE blood and gore, and not alot of swearing in it, but if your not a fan, it will just seem weird to you. <br>  And then there is the V show at planet hollywood, and that is a family friendly show and is SO much fun! it has magic, comedians, some awesome dancing, and perfect for those ages.<br>  <br>  There is also the amusment rides in one of the hotels, [the hotel is escaping my mind right now, sorry, hahaha] but that is really fun if you want thrills. <br>  <br>  then if your walking down the strip, there is the m&m factory, and the coke factory, both are things you dont want to skip out of. <br>  <br>  there is also the wax museum. that is a TOTALY fun experience and I would not skip that either. <br>  <br>  then just walking down the strip at night is SUPER fun!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and have a great vacation!|`|satoCRC6aa	Red rock national park,   West side of vegas<br>  Body exposition and Titannic at   Lexor hotel<br>  Atomic testing museum, A-Bomb history,   Flamingo and Paradice<br>  New York ,New York ,          Rollercoaster<br>  Review Journal, local paper( 2 for 1 buffets) for local station casino's hotels and to do listings in vegas

Besides. the US debt is so big that including Canada and Mexico into your mess would not make much of a difference.  It would be like a parent expecting their children to help pay the bills.<br>  <br>  Canadians are against a North American currency.  We value our history and culture.  The problem is with the way our dollar fluctuates.  Just a few years ago our dollar was around 63 cents US, then it reached parity about the time the economic crisis in the US began.  Now it is around 80 cents US.  A high dollar has it's advantages and a low dollar also has it's advantages.  A dollar that fluctuates as ours has the last couple years makes it very difficult on businesses.  If the dollar were to get really high or really low in comparison to the US green back it could be very damaging to our economy.  That is why we will need to go to the Amero eventually.  Just like 9/11, the government will make a crisis that will have the people of North America begging for the Amero.  <br>  <br>  The only way we can avoid it is by doing less business with the US and filling that vacuum with international trade.|`|47b90d488b927708f73a39f5d3541e4baa	Are you kidding?

8ssiOsDzaa	wow that's a big step you're taking, and honestly? people and especially teens leave this country each and every day. the political situation isn't good at all, people are very nice. i live in canada, it's been two years now and i'm 18, and trust me there's no such beautiful and warm place and people as the lebanese. if you have lebanese friends you must know that; it's nothing compared to americans, canadians or any other country in the whole world. most of the people speak arabic, french and english so it won't be hard to fit in and you'll immediately find friends.<br>  if you're still at school i suggest you finish school and go to university there, if you're at university you should go to university there because it'll be easier for you to fit in, and then find a job in the future. <br>  life in lebanon is beautiful, though it's expensive and people don't earn a lot of money. you start with 500$ per month if you're really lucky, and it's very hard to start at a good position, you should work hard too to get what you want. <br>  as for living somewhere, if you want a nice safe place well it's the capital beirut or if not its suburbs, some places are expensive but you can either live on university campus or get your own place. there is one thing though, people won't take it well if you live with your boyfriend, they start gossiping before you even realize it. but roommates and everything else is totally normal, and lebanese teens are awesome. <br>  if you really want to move there i suggest you get some help, do you have any relatives or friends who live there? cause if not it'll be very hard, and you should visit once in summer and in winter just to see how life is before you move definetely because you might find it hard not speaking arabic very well, or even finding life expensive, and the political situation very very sucky. but when it comes to making friends and social life, it's really awesome and i don't think you will be disappointed. <br>  so take your time before making any decision, and don't do it all by yourself<br>  if you need anything else let me know i'll see what i can do to help :)|`|pURvyRTMaa	Its nice if u want to visit ...<br>  but simply, to build a future?

Atlanta is in the middle of demolishing most public housing apartments anyway.|`|F9EvPa1Uaa	Yeah if you love nightlife and everything. We have the largest aquarium in the world here, and there is many things to do here. The houses are pretty cheaper here,and the things if you go to the right part of the town, some of the people here are friendly. Well if you have kids, don't move to clayton county because if accredadation lost. If you're in too hip-hop music and r&b you will love it here because we have a lot of hip hop celebrites here like dallas austin, ludacris, and more.

7PMpJqiiaa	Have you tried jungle hiking?  The tropical beaches are fantastic, but the tropical rain forest is amazing too.  Just bring good quality Tevas or sturdy flip-flops as it is quite muddy.  Manoa Falls right in back of Honolulu in the back of Manoa Valley is amazing, you hike through bamboo forests, giant ferns, orchids and so forth.  Careful about diving in the waterfall pools (leptospirosis).  Mauna Willi Falls in back of Kailua is harder, but amazing tropical fall and pool.<br>  <a href="http://www.hawaiiweb.com/html/hiking/manoa_falls_trail.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hawaiiweb.com/html/hiking/man...</a><br>  <br>  There is also great hiking at Kaena Point, Diamond Head Crater (very hot inside Diamond Head, but view at end is amazing)<br>  <a href="http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/hawaii/honolulu-and-oahu/activity_1984992.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fodors.com/world/north-americ...</a><br>  <br>  Are you going during July 4th?  The best fireworks of the year are at Magic Island, near the boat marina point that juts out between Waikiki Ala Wai Canal and Ala Moana Beach Park (across from the Ala Moana Shopping Center).  This is true "big time" fireworks synchronized to music radio music KINE.  All of Ala Moana Beach Park turns into an instant tent city during the day, with families arriving sometimes at 5AM in the morning or even earlier to get the best spots.<br>  <br>  Are you  into Asian culture?  July starts the Obon Festival season for buddhist churches.  Hawaii has a huge population of Japanese-Americans, so this is a big deal.  It is their equivalent to many culture's Festival of the Dead.  They go to the churches and dance the oObon dance to chanting and music...pretty amazing to watch, defintely colorful.<br>  <br>  And while you are at it, if you have not been to Japan, visit Byodo-in Temple in Kaneohe (windward side).  Hard to find, you even have to go through a cemetary, but don't let that put you off from going to ring the bell for luck, view the amazing setting and garden ponds.<br>  <a href="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2823433-byodo_in_temple_honolulu-i">http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-28...</a><br>  <br>  If you can get to Maui via boat ferry or jet, they have a new experience called the zipline.

PA0bGBtCaa	Well I would check online first, and then consult a travel agent and ask them for the exact same dates and see what they will tell you. There are pros and cons for both though.<br>  <br>  Pros for websites are that you get the lowest possible fares from the airline directly. If the airline needs to call you regarding a schedule change or cancellation, then they have your information. Now that I'm thinking about it, there are no real bad things about online :)<br>  <br>  Travel Agents: They have deals with most carriers and sometimes can offer you a better deal. However, you need to pay a "fee" for their services usually. So that's why I'd look at online and the agent for the same flight to see what the deal is. Also if the airline cancels your flight, or changes something about your reservation, then they cannot contact you if you're through a travel agent. That is a HUGE deal considering how many flights get canceled everyday. <br>  <br>  Finally I'd recommend getting a rapid rewards credit card on the most frequently used airline. That way you can earn miles and points while you're traveling for work, and you can end up earning a free flight.|`|5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	How is the routing for your husband? Is it a round trip eg. LAX-JFK-LAX? If its this kind of trips, its wise to buy online. However, if hes flying to a few airports each trip(eg. LAX-HKG-SIN-FRA-LHR-JFK-HOU-LAX), its almost impossible to buy such tickets online. Thus, its good to consult a travel agent as they can get better deals for such trips.
q3qJIC5raa	There's a Bally's on Sixth Ave and 19th street.  You can probably get a reasonable deal from them.  I hear the gym is nice and has a lot of cardio equipment.
i2FRvkEpaa	Plenty of history as anywhere in Europe. Cheap by some standards. Many, many miles of beaches even though the water isn't exactly warm (if that's a minus, one should tey the Mediterranean or the Caribbean, for example). Differences between regions, namely in the weather, the cuisine, the geology and the cuisine. A lot of people will be able and willing to speak to you in English. One shouldn't stick to the Algarve, which is in fact touristy but not one of the most interestin regions. Thsislands, namely the Azores, are also well worth a visit. Unfortunately, if you smoke, as in most of the western world these days (Spain and Germany, so it seems, aside, when the owners of cafes, restaurants and so forth have a wider possibility of choice as do the customers), it's quite hard to find smoking places. As for the things that currently worry the Portuguese, I'll keep my mouth shut.|`|xtvs4B7Jaa	Great country to visit.<br>  A lot of story and culture in it and you should rent a car, especially in Lisbon, like the previous user said.

(so get fastpasses for the rides with the longest waits fastpass is free. you just take your park ticket and put it into the machine located in front of the most popular rides and the machine gives you your ticket back along with a slip of paper that tells you a time slot to come back ex: 3pm-4pm. you go on other rides until your time slot comes up then you go on that ride. *note* you cannot get another fastpass until you time slot has come up)<br>  <br>  the only ride that will definitely be longer than all the rest is soarin at times its line will get as long as 200 minutes. thats 3 hours and 20 minutes! for soarin you need to get to epcot when it opens and head right for it to avoid the really long lines. if you go on it first thing your wait time will most likely be 30-45 minutes. and if you want to get a fast pass for it you need to do it early in the day cuz they run out by 1pm. <br>  <br>  have fun!|`|fMPyLqW4aa	I was 10 a few years ago lol.

This was the best $20 I spent for my family's July 2008 vacation to Disney. The book contains reviews for restaurants, hotels, and attractions on and off Disney property. However, the best part of the book are the touring plans! The plans give you step by step instructions on where to go and when to go in order to avoid the longest lines.<br>  <br>  For example: "Soarin" in EPCOT is one of the most popular rides in all of Disney. A 2-hour wait in line is not uncommon to partake in this awesome experience. However, using the touring plan in the book and maximizing Disney's "Fast Pass" system, we were able to ride it twice in a row without waiting in line one time!<br>  <br>  By the way, if you don't know what the "Fast Pass" system is, then definitely get the book or ask us that are in the know at yahooanswers. It's fast, easy, and one of the few FREE things in Disney. Yes, it is absolutely FREE!<br>  <br>  Go out and buy the book today.

You'll have the jacket over it maybe a good 70% of the time,usually when you're walking around the city).  And the jacket I'm bringing will most likely be a feather down jacket...  Not too thick though since the temperatures are in the high 40's and 55 degrees F.<br>  Looks like it's gonna be rainy there too so I suggest you bring a compact umbrella.<br>  <br>  lol, I'll probably be shopping for a nicer looking one since I don't want to seem too dumpy when I go there and I'll be wearing the jacket everyday.

rJi6a3XAaa	Kaew (????) is a common female nickname that means glass or crystal.  It's pronounced similar to how it is spelled.  Here's the breakdown:<br>  <br>  K:  pronounced as a sound between G and K<br>  AE:  pronounced like the a in cat<br>  W:  pronounced like a regular w<br>  <br>  Just to make it more fun and complicated, Kaew in the Thai language has a tone mark that makes it a high sound.  This is really difficult to explain, but here's a video I found on youtube of a girl band called Zaza.  One of the members (the girl on the left) is named Kaew so you can hear her introduce herself here:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyEMM-GGENw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyEMM-GGE...</a><br>  First they all say Hello this is Zaza, then they each introduce themselves individually.

Iran has strong ties with Russia, Syria, Greece, Armenia, and "other organizations" in the Middle East, therefore Iran is the dominant regional power, and once they develop nuclear weapons they will truly be the voice for the Muslim world against Israel...as for Turkey, yes it is definately strong but Turkey does not want a regional war because Turkey has NO real allies but a ton of enemies which include Greece, Russia, Bulgaria, Iran, Kurds (Kurdistan), Syria, Armenia...an all out war with Turkey would also then involve opportunistic countries to join such as Serbia to finish it's Balkan Wars, Romania and Ukraine would also assist the Orthodox Christian countries fighting the Turks...remember when Russia threatened Turkey with WWIII back in 1990 if Turkey tried to help Azerbaijan because it lost the war with Armenia (which Armenia today occupies 20% of Azerbaijan), and the Turks bowed their heads before the Russians, then Russians invade Georgia last year, and Turkey did nothing even though Georgia is considered the only country with good diplomatic relations with Turkey in the region...so you do the math, it would spell an end to Turkey, and they know it ,1923 came very close to relocating back to Mongolia, I doubt they want to try to start up a war with anyone and find themselves in ruins in 2023|`|EoCadP7kaa	israel is not the leader because all of its neighbours hates it. saudi arabia isnt either because its a pupet state of the usa. turkey also isnt because it hosts military exercises for israel. there is no leader in the middle east because the usa has done such a good job at causing conflicts between countries. the usa does not want the middle east to be strong. the usa doesnt want anyone to be strong. by causing and creating conflicts between countries, the usa is able to maintain its position as top dog.|`|S1uPEgbTaa	For me , what makes someone a "leader" in this times is about money and influence on economics.<br>  <br>  So the countries which have petreleum/oil those are the leaders.<br>  Saudi Arabia,U.A.E, are possibly the leadears.<br>  <br>  As for mentioning israeal,I don't think its the leader.What I think,is that Jews (in general ,not only Israelites) are the world rulers.Their country,no, their diaspora all over the world,yes.<br>  <br>  Its all about money nowdays, the one who has the money (energy),is the the winner. ..|`|09a99abaf4d7de10668fc440ef5838e1aa	Military , economy, geopilitic and democracy makes you a leader. <br>  <br>  Turkey : M 9 + E 6 + G 8 + D 7 = 30<br>  Iran :  M 6 + E 8 + G 4 + D 2  = 20<br>  Israel : M 4 + E 6 + G 2 + D 8 = 20<br>  S Arabia :  M 5 + E 9 + G 6 + D 1 = 21<br>  US : M 10 + E 8 + G 1 + D 8 = 27<br>  .|`|AA11854330	I pity all those countries you counted.

Turkey has one of the world's most powerful militia. It is one of the most developed countries in both the Middle East and the Balkans. It's significance is only increased with its membership in NATO.<br>  <br>  Turkey's a firmly secular state, with a muslim majority; this has had its positives and negatives. There are several restrictions in the Turkish code of law that prohibit certain religious practices (for instance, the hi-jab is restricted).<br>  <br>  Turkish people are nationalistic; which means they are damn proud of being Turkish (which is a good thing, in my opinion). However, again, this nationalistic ideology hasn't always served Turkey well. Notoriously, they passed a law (Article 301) which prohibits anybody in Turkey to criticize the government or Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (the father of the Republic).<br>  <br>  Prior to the foundation of the Republic of Turkey, the general area was owned by its predecessor state, the Ottoman Empire - a Sultanate that, in its prime, had controlled most of the Middle East, the Balkans, and Northern Africa. The empire, which lasted from 1299-1923, was at the center of interactions between Europe and Asia, and its legacy is still relevant today.
AA10258539	Is a thought faster? I think there is something faster. Here.<br>  <br>   The store manager at Wal-Mart was given the task of  hiring an<br>   individual to fill a job opening. After sorting  through a stack<br>   of resumes he found four people who were equally qualified --<br>   an American, a Russian, an Australian and a Filipino.<br>   <br>   He decided to call the four in and ask them only one  question.<br>   Their answer would determine who of them would get  the job.<br>   <br>   The day came and as the four sat around the conference room table<br>   the interviewer asked, "What is the fastest thing you know?"<br>   <br>   Dave, the American, replied, "A THOUGHT. It just  pops into your<br>   head. There's no warning that it's on the way; it's  just there.<br>   A thought is the fastest thing I know of."<br>   <br>   "That's very good!" replied the interviewer.<br>   <br>   "And now you sir?" he asked Vladimir, the Russian.<br>   <br>   "Hmm.... let me see. A blink! It comes and goes and  you don't<br>   know that it ever happened. A BLINK is the fastest  thing I know."<br>   <br>   "Excellent!" said the interviewer. "The blink of an  eye, that's<br>   a very popular cliche for speed."<br>   <br>   He then turned to George, the Australian who was contemplating<br>   his reply. "Well, out at my dad's ranch, you step out of the<br>   house and on the wall there's a light switch. When  you flip that<br>   switch, way out across the pasture the light in the  barn comes<br>   on. Yes mate, TURNING ON A LIGHT is the fastest thing I can think of."<br>   <br>   The interviewer was very impressed with the third answer and<br>   thought he had found his man. "It's hard to beat the speed of<br>   light" he thought.<br>   <br>   Turning to Eleuterio, the Filipino, the fourth and final man,  the<br>   interviewer posed the same question. Eleuterio  replied,<br>   "Apter herring da tree pribyus ansers sir, et's obyus to me dat<br>   the fastest thing is Diarrhea."<br>   <br>   "WHAT!?" said the interviewer, stunned by the response.

I was born into a Bedouin tribe in Northern Israel, one of 11 children, and began life as shepherd living in our family tent. I went on to serve in the Israeli border police, and later earned a master's degree in political science from Tel Aviv University before joining the Israel Foreign Ministry.<br>  <br>  I am a proud Israeli - along with many other non-Jewish Israelis such as Druze, Bahai, Bedouin, Christians and Muslims, who live in one of the most culturally diversified societies and the only true democracy in the Middle East. Like America, Israeli society is far from perfect, but let us deals honestly. By any yardstick you choose - educational opportunity, economic development, women and gay's rights, freedom of speech and assembly, legislative representation - Israel's minorities fare far better than any other country in the Middle East<br>  <br>  So, I would like to share the following with organizers of Israel Apartheid week, for those of them who are open to dialogue and not blinded by a hateful ideology:<br>  <br>  You are part of the problem, not part of the solution: If you are really idealistic and committed to a better world, stop with the false rhetoric. We need moderate people to come together in good faith to help find the path to relieve the human suffering on both sides of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Vilification and false labeling is a blind alley that is unjust and takes us nowhere.<br>  <br>  You deny Israel the fundamental right of every society to defend itself: You condemn Israel for building a security barrier to protect its citizens from suicide bombers and for striking at buildings from which missiles are launched at its cities - but you never offer an alternative. Aren't you practicing yourself a deep form of racism by denying an entire society the right to defend itself?<br>  <br>  Your criticism is willfully hypocritical: Do Israel's Arab citizens suffer from disadvantage? You better believe it. Do African Americans 10 minutes from the Berkeley campus suffer from disadvantage - you better believe it, too. So should we launch a Berkeley Apartheid Week, or should we seek real ways to better our societies and make opportunity more available.<br>  <br>  You are betraying the moderate Muslims and Jews who are working to achieve peace: Your radicalism is undermining the forces for peace in Israel and in the Palestinian territories. We are working hard to move toward a peace agreement that recognizes the legitimate rights of both Israel and the Palestinian people, and you are tearing down by falsely vilifying one side.<br>  <br>  To the organizers of Israel Apartheid Week I would like to say:<br>  <br>  If Israel were an apartheid state, I would not have been appointed here, nor would I have chosen to take upon myself this duty. There are many Arabs, both within Israel and in the Palestinian territories who have taken great courage to walk the path of peace.

It is not just Northern ireland that is divided. We are responsible for a lot of the problems through the centuries whether we like it or not.  Our ancestors have left us with many countries hating us.  I hate traveling to other countries and admitting that i am English.  We should try our best to give back to other countries what our ancestors stole and killed for and maybe then we would not be hated.  <br>  As for the someone person that said they studied history.  I find it very hard to believe that you studied Northern ireland history objectively.  If you had you would never have answered the question the way you have.

AjEftvtaaa	Ryanair - Stansted to Glasgow, ￡20 return including all taxes and charges.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ryanair.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ryanair.com</a><br>  <br>  Glasgow, the largest city in Scotland, offers fabulous shopping, crowded pubs and clubs and terrific restaurants. Art lovers will also find plenty to capture their imagination, as the city is home to more than 30 galleries and museums, including the world famous Burrell Collection and Saint Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art. Naturally it is also possible to visit the coast from Glasgow or discover the rich history of the region by exploring neighbouring cities and villages.<br>  <br>  Architecture: Many of the city’s buildings date back to the 19th century, when Glasgow was the trading centre of Scotland. Nowadays, the city palaces of yesteryear serve as offices and department stores. Enjoying both architecture and the contents of the buildings is the theme of The Lighthouse in the heart of Glasgow, with a variety of dynamic exhibitions on art and architecture.<br>  <br>  Shopping: Glasgow is the largest shopping city of Great Britain after London and offers excellent shopping. Visit the pedestrianised shopping precincts Sauchiehall Street, Buchanan Street and Argyle Street or one of the indoor shopping malls, such as the Buchanan Galleries or St Enoch Centre.<br>  <br>  Food and drink: Whisky, preferably single malt, is the drink of choice in Scotland. A visit to a distillery is certainly worthwhile. Like in England, the Scots enjoy a hearty breakfast with bacon and eggs, whereas dinner usually consists of a wide selection of meats. Salmon is also widely available. Mutton lovers must certainly try the traditional Haggis.<br>  <br>  Getting Around: Glasgow has one of the most advanced, fully integrated public transport systems in Europe. Glaswegians are very reliant on buses, the underground, and the local railway network that cross the city and link it to the suburbs. The Travel Centre at St Enoch Square (+44 (0) 141 226 4826) is a good starting-point for general Glasgow-wide travel information.<br>  <br>  Underground: The Glasgow Underground has twin tunnels providing a circular service linking 15 stations. Trains are frequent (approximately one every five minutes), and tickets are cheap, but must be bought in advance of the journey either from a machine or from the ticket office at the station.<br>  <br>  Rail: An extensive network of regular and frequent local rail services operates in Glasgow, its suburbs and the West of Scotland. Most suburbs and towns within this area are accessible by train. If you are staying outside Glasgow and do not want to drive into the city, you can use the 'Park-and-Ride' system, which allows free parking at suburban rail stations, where you then continue your journey by train. CCTV protects most of the parking facilities - the Park-and-Ride also operates at four Glasgow Underground stations.<br>  <br>  For more information on Glasgow visit the official Glasgow Tourism Website at www.seeglasgow.com<br>  <br>  East Magazine, Singapore<br>  “Glasgow has reinvented itself more times than Madonna."<br>  <br>  Frommer's Travel Guide, USA<br>  "More cosmopolitan and modern than its capital neighbour, not to mention a more happening night life"<br>  <br>  In Style Magazine, USA<br>  “Think Manhattan with a Scottish Accent.”<br>  <br>  Indianapolis Star, USA<br>  "Glasgow is a must-see destination"<br>  <br>  Indianapolis Star, USA<br>  "I'm happy to have visited Glasgow before the crowds show up"<br>  <br>  Io Donna, Italy<br>  “Città scozzese più glamour del momento.” ("Glasgow is Scotland's most glamorous city")<br>  <br>  Lonely Planet<br>  "Glasgow is one of Britain's largest, liveliest and most interesting cities"<br>  <br>  Lonely Planet<br>  "Glasgow is regenerating and evolving at a dizzying pace"<br>  <br>  MD Magazine, Germany<br>  “Glasgow is in, Glasgow is trendy.”<br>  <br>  Metropolitan Home, USA<br>  “Glasgow, Scotland – Exciting by Design.”<br>  <br>  National Geographic Channel, USA<br>  "Glasgow – this exuberant, design-conscious city of high sophistication and even higher style"<br>  <br>  National Geographic Channel, USA<br>  “If there’s an inspirational spirit looming over the city’s renaissance, it’s Mackintosh”<br>  <br>  Salud Magazine, Mexico<br>  "Europe's most beautiful city"<br>  <br>  The Boston Globe, USA<br>  "If you love wonderful architecture, Glasgow is your beat"<br>  <br>  The Enquirer, USA <br>  "Britain's coolest city"<br>  <br>  Time Magazine, USA<br>  “Brimming with style and culture, Scotland’s biggest city is a revelation.”<br>  <br>  Time Magazine, USA<br>  "Europe's secret capital of music"<br>  <br>  Travel & Leisure Magazine, USA <br>  “Glasgow is the United Kingdom’s hippest and most happening city”<br>  <br>  Wallpaper*, USA<br>  "Where art meets design, fashion and music in a sharp undercurrent of creativity."

hh9hoMA2aa	no, philippines is a lovely country with friendly and peace loving people|`|4e18c82089d9eecf334053f6edf2d156aa	you can compare the safety to most large american cities. for instance, it is safe to travel to New York City but you will be warned to be aware of your surroundings.<br>  <br>  some areas of the philippines are more dangerous than others. several murders have happened to foreigners in Angeles lately. an American was killed outside his hotel a few days ago in angeles. although i dont have numbers to back this up, i would think that you are much more likely to just be a victim of a "hold up" then you would be of any other type of violent crime.<br>  <br>  also be aware that police and rescue services are non-existent compared to what you would be used to in the western world. if the cops do show up they are more likely to try to get money from you than actually help you.<br>  <br>  bottom line: its generally safe but dont bring anything you cant afford to lose.|`|FBAmSYKKaa	No, it is generally safe to travel to most parts of the country. For the person traveling for the first time in the Philippines, just be aware of your country's travel advisory, which is very conservative to say the least as your safety is their main concern.<br>  <br>  I am a Filipina who was a long time officer and member of the Northern Mindanao Regional Tourism Council, I travel a lot and I have been to many places in the country taking every kind of transport possible.<br>  <br>  I only have this to say, remain safe by staying away from southwestern Mindanao like Cotabato, Zamboanga and Sulu. The rest of the country is relatively safe if you count the occasional pickpockets and con men, something that other countries also have. Just be wary and alert at all times and keep your valuables like passport and money safe. <br>  <br>  There are thousands of tourists who come everyday. In any place you go, visit and seek information from the local government offices. Look for the local tourism officer. They will be of big help to you aside from the Regional Tourism Offices. This is a useful link if you want to come and visit the country. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gov.ph/cat_tourism/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.gov.ph/cat_tourism/default.as...</a><br>  <br>  I hope you will have a memorable, safe and enjoyable stay in the places you visit in my country.|`|3AkLGAcnaa	No.  You can even travel to Mindanao as long as you avoid the southern part of Mindanao.  Davao and Cagayan de Oro is one of the peaceful places in the Philippine.  <br>  <br>  Just don't show off if you don't want to be pickpocketed.  Casual laidback clothing is all you need when in the Philippines (that is if you're not here for official business).  Think about going on a vacation, would you bring your heirlooms or your expensive suits?|`|VHpAgP22aa	the answer to that as every one else said, is no it isnt as dangerous as you hear. just be careful of your surrounding. i been there 5 times in 4 years on vacation. stayed in quezon city and also traveled to bagio city up in the mountains , and aslo to tagaytay and a few other places.i was always with at least 1 of my friends that are filippino. never had ounce of problems. i plan to go back on vacation there again in next year|`|RNavvDOcaa	In general, it is quite safe to travel to the Philippines.  In particular, there are some areas (in Mindanao) where fighting is going on and for the moment, tourists are strongly advised to stay away from those areas.|`|jsGPk1Ccaa	philippines maybe small country but it has many islands big and small. tourists come from everywhere coz of beaches. it is safe. boracay, baguio, manila, cebu, palawan - all safe beautiful places.|`|rNyBkedoaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT!... its really a safe place to travel but dont bring to much you know...money and jewelries if you are going to stores and malls...it might get snatched...but its really a safe place and has lots of guards...|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	it's only dangerous if you don't use your common sense...|`|KVlRYoidaa	as long as you don't get near any policeman.|`|5ySW0lT0aa	Common misconception. Perth (Aus), Washington DC, and Atlanta is far dangerous than Manila. Just travel sensibly, stay with Filipino friends you know, avoid shady places (if your gut feel tells you it is particularly dangerous to venture in some unfamiliar area, and if your Filipino friends tell you that they would avoid themselves - THEN DONT). Skip girlie bars, and seedy areas. You will know it from the get-go. Enjoy the nightlife but be responsible. Manila has one of the best nightlifes in Asia - check out Makati (Greenbelt, Rockwell, Glorietta), Taguig (The Fort Strip, Serendra,Boni High Street), Pasig (Metrowalk, Silver City), Quezon City (Eastwood), Manila (Mall of Asia Promenade) for some of the best nightlife.<br>  <br>  Visayas is generally safe (Boracay), only bit parts of Mindanao are dangerous. Amazing beaches are in Camiguin and top international surfing is available in Siargao.|`|2fIsVJEcaa	I traveled to the Philippines last july 2008, i went by myself but met up with my girl friend at my hotel in Cebu. I had no problems what so ever . Its probably safer to have someone with you, as it would be in any country. The people are very friendly. <br>  I was warned about pick pockets, but once again i had no problems with them. The Australian Government advised me to not travel to Mindanao Due to some Terrorist activity. But i also went there and again had no problems, again very friendly people.<br>  However there would be some parts of Mindanao you should not travel to. Do your research before traveling and you will know what places to avoid. Mainly places closer to Indonesia. If you go , you will have a good time. Here is a link you can look at From the Australian Government,   <a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/</a>   <br>  This second link is direct to the Philippines Travel advisory.<br>  <a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/Philippines" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/v...</a><br>  However you may be able to obtain one from your own Government.<br>  They are only advice, I must admit i nearly canceled my trip due to the warning, because my girl friend is from Mindanao. But we arranged to meet in Cebu instead so i went. But as i said i still traveled to Mindanao and had no problems at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck and enjoy your trip|`|490fec2c14d3decaa42039694e5b6de2aa	Not dangerous as long as you avoid places that are. tagged as places unsafe to visit like jolo, sulu.

545c8190dd574a20dff4291cb029a8ccaa	I will disagree with my friend Alan this time.<br>  <br>  The economy in Ukraine is at critical mass for collapse right now. The government is overspending money they don't have, not paying teachers, doctors, or retirees, and inflation is rampant.<br>  <br>  Alan is correct that the East of Ukraine is suffering more, but that mainly because their industry is there. The factory closings, and reduced work weeks, are forcing unemployement up. However, those in the West of Ukraine are not faring so well either - as they are predominantly reliant upon tourism (which is also down).<br>  <br>  Utilities nationwide were just raised again (my mother-in-law pays her entire pension - roughly $150 USD - which she isn't getting - to utilities), meat is unaffordable, and, well.. the government is implementing stupid laws, such as requiring all the schools to install energy efficient windows (but aren't funding). Forclosures are exceptionally high, and real estate value is dropping like lead.<br>  <br>  It's not pretty.|`|WT7Gub0Xaa	As everywhere else the economy of Ukraine is suffering With the global recession.<br>  Some people in Ukraine are fairing better than others, and a lot depends on where you live to some extent.<br>  Those who live in Kiev or in the west of Ukraine such as Liviv or Ivano frankivsk are much better placed than say those that live in the area around the Donetsk basin where there are old soviet style industry and mining.|`|kAuQugVKaa	I agree with previous answers! <br>  In Ukraine global recession takes a turn for the worse because of unstable political situation.

chdszaRKaa	Yes I know !<br>  On the first picture is the staircase going from the Chapelle Sainte Barbe (15th century I think)  to the nowadays car park and so to the road access to the site of the chapelle.<br>  On the second picture you can see the Ellé river, passing down the Chapelle Sainte Barbe (but maybe it has been taken in another point of the river).<br>  On the third you see the Chapelle Sainte Barbe.<br>  This place is located in Le Faou?t, Morbihan, Bretagne, France.<br>  The story of the chapelle is : A conte was hunting in the forest when a storm starts. A ligthening touched the hunter but didn't killed him. Because he survived the conte said that he wanted to build a chapelle to thanks god for let him alive. So the chapelle has been built and it was not an easy thing to do because of the slope, but finally they succeeded. The chapelle is dedicated to Sainte Barbe who is also the patronne for the firemens (and others). I think you can easily find who was Barbe (Barbara).<br>  The site of the Chapelle Sainte Barbe is really a nice place.

Delta Air Lines (I'm assuming you're flying them, as you're originating in Atlanta) flies the Boeing 757-200 series aircraft in three different configurations:<br>  <br>       -the standard, 183-seat domestic 757-200 seating arrangement; these aircraft have audio entertainment, as well as television monitors over the aisles in all classes.  For more information, visit <a href="http://www.delta.com/planning_reservations/plan_flight/aircraft_types_layout/757-200/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.delta.com/planning_reservatio...</a><br>       -the 757 with live TV (also known as the 757 Transcontinental, or simply "transcon"); this, along with audio, video, and other entertainment, is provided through personal television monitors at each seat in all classes.  For more information, visit <a href="http://www.delta.com/planning_reservations/plan_flight/aircraft_types_layout/757_200_transcon/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.delta.com/planning_reservatio...</a><br>       -the ETOPS-rated 757-200 aircraft acquired from American; presented as "757-200ER Transatlantic" aircraft (no 757 series/version with the ER (or Extended Range) suffix has ever been produced), these planes are usually used for flights to Europe.

Most of the ATL-SEA flights are on the Transcon aircraft; however, the red-eye flight uses a 757 with the domestic configuration.  In other words, unless you are on the overnight flight, you will have a PTV.  If you'd like more information, let us know the particular flight and when you'll be traveling.<br>  <br>  Have a good trip!|`|AA10780838	No.  On 757s they don't have one in every seat.|`|fukzl8oaaa	By personal TV's do you mean on the seat backs?  Probably not....it depends on the airline..... but these you will find mostly                              on international travel.  I doubt if you will find them domestic in the US.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Tony, my guess is that you aren't from around here. I guess there's no way to tell you gently that the average price for a room here is over $100 per night. $40 rooms would be the worst, most cockroach-infested hellhole you can imagine. That's just the way it is here. Many of us here spend day after day telling people it's not cheap here, which is why you are bound to get some rather sarcastic answers.<br>  <br>  If you want a relatively cheap place, you're going to have to stay at a hostel. And before you post ANOTHER question, here's the answer: <a href="http://www.hilosangeles.org/." rel="nofollow">http://www.hilosangeles.org/.</a> It's a hostel in Santa Monica.<br>  <br>  Just curious, where does everybody hear about Santa Monica College?

I don't get it.|`|AzKUBp2Jaa	you dont say how much you want to spend<br>  but you could try the youth hostel on 2nd street in Santa Monica<br>  you aslo dont tell us how old you are either|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	Please define what you consider to be "cheap".

zdQWVaGsaa	Jamaica is a fantastic place to be. I used to live there and I go there every couple of years to visit friends and family. I'm going there in August (can't wait). The food is fantastic (and cheap). There are a million and one different type of fruit drinks. The sea is crystal clear. The sky is so blue and the land is so green. Montego Bay is fantastic but I love Ocho Rios (and most of St Ann). Little Ochie seafood restaurant in Alligator Pond is the greatest seafood restaurant in all the cosmos. I hate to say this (simply because hardly anyone goes there and it is nice and quiet) but Bluefields is perhaps the best unknown beach in Jamaica. Everyone goes to the North Coast but the South Coast is a forgotten gem (I hope it stays that way). The Jerk chicken and pork from the Pork Pit in Montego Bay is awesome. Mannnnnnnnnn, why did I start to talk about it, I want to go nowwwwwww!!!!!<br>  <br>  The people are friendly but you have your occasional knucklehead who wants to sell you something you don't want or put you in a bus going to a destination that you've never heard. If you are friendly and firm they will respect that. Jamaicans are not timid people; don't be put off by their frankness as they don't mean anything by it and if you are friendly and frank they relate to that.|`|en7wgVfyaa	When you go to Jamaica you dont want to return home.

AuvMZYTSaa	I had already answered the exact same question posted previously - IF your flight is delayed due to weather, you will be listed on the next  flight that has available seats.  You will NOT be given priority over someone that was originally scheduled on that flight. <br>  <br>  You cannot give a time limit on how long you will be delayed.   If you 'chew out' the desk, you will msot likely be escorted off the concourse and there is the possibility that you will be given a refund on the remainder of your ticket and then you will be on your own to purchase a ride to your destination - at full fare.<br>  <br>  People sleep on the floor of the airport for severral reasons -  in situations where THOUSANDS of people are stranded, rooms are immediately snatched up.  People do not want to pay full rack rates on hotels.   People also want to be immediately available if flights do open up for reassignment.<br>  <br>  Its the weather - NO ONE has control over it and no matter how much you chimp scream, there is nothing anyone can do to resolve delays/cancellations due to an Act of God/Mother Nature.|`|PA0bGBtCaa	Well you can't put anyone on a flight if there are no flights to put people on. The second the weather forecasts come out and people see ahead of time that there will be flight cancellations, they are usually the first ones who will just reschedule. IE, the expert travelers.<br>  <br>  The people in your friend's situation are just stuck. The airline can only rebook you to the next "available" flight. That may not be for three or four days after the storm. The airline cannot add additional flights into a city after a storm because then they would need to cancel other flights to get the planes to fly those extra segments.<br>  <br>  Why do people sleep in an airport? Well where else are they going to sleep? Airlines do not control the weather, so they cannot control the fact that the conditions are not safe to fly in. You heard of the Continental plane that crashed in Buffalo a few weeks ago. It's tragedies such as that one that will make airlines cancel all of their flights due to weather. <br>  <br>  The airline will NOT pay for customers to sleep in hotel rooms. They can, however, give the customers vouchers for a distressed passenger rate at one of the hotels they have deals with, but the customer would have to pay for their own room, food, and car rental if they wanted one.  People also sleep in airports because some of them were dropped off by friends, and if it's snowing, then no one will risk their lives to go pick you up from the airport. Or at least, I wouldn't. <br>  <br>  Also, if you chew out an airline agent, that will get you NOTHING. What are you going to bribe them with? Money? You can't do that either, and they cannot really do anything. They can offer you a full refund of your ticket or they can rebook you out of another city nearby that they serve, but that's about it. And I can personally go on all day about the weather earlier this week because I was on the frontlines dealing with cancelled flights too! And it wasn't snowing where I was, but the weather where my planes were going was crappy.<br>  <br>  Never yell at the airline staff. It's not their fault the plane is cancelled. All yelling will do is ensure that you get "overlooked" when it comes time to rebook the whole plane, and you may get a worse seat, your bags may "disappear," or simply not show up when you want it to. About the bags, yes, I've seen that happen many of times. If you are just straight rude to an airport agent, then they simply can call the bag room, have them pull your bag, and just not send it right away to your city, or they can re tag it and send it internationally and have customs keep it indefinitely becuase there's no person to claim it. So the bottom line is that you can't change the weather, so just be patient!
N7G26k4Iaa	No one can tell you the odds on this happening.  That is why weather issues are referred to as "acts of God".  If your delayed due to weather issues, the airline will not give you anything.  They will most likely not reschedule your whole trip, especially if you have made one part of of the trip.  If the delay is due to mechanical failure, then they will.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	The odds are 14:11. <br>  <br>  No, not really. It depends on what two days of the week, time of year, what airline you're on, and so on.

zs4pFVpCaa	I lived in Pontchartrain Hall. They are the newest dorms, built a year ago. They are really nice. Nicer than what a college dorm normally looks like. I lived in a four bedroom dorm. I had my own room and shared a common living area with my roommates. Pontchartrain Hall doesn't have a kitchen, but Privateer Place does.<br>  Privateer Place are more like apartments on campus where you pay monthly. They are a little bit more expensive but offer more liberties than Pontchartrain Hall, ie you don't have to sign in guests.<br>  All the dorms come with ethernet internet and basic cable hookups. You have the option of choosing 4 bedrooms, 2 bedrooms, or a 1 bedroom unit.

Quand nous sommes arrivés en France il y avait eu un ouragan et des arbres étaient tombés sur la route.

J'avais mangé un sandwich  qui m'a rendu malade. Nous aurions préféré aller au bord de la mer mais notre voiture est tombée en panne et nous sommes restés au bord de la route attendant du secours pendant longtemps. Quand nous sommes revenus le Speedferry avait été annulé et, comme la compagnie avait fait faillite, on ne nous a pas remboursés. Quelles vacances catastrophiques!

6kvmAvwEaa	City centre is quite expensive but the "nicer/posher" areas would be south of the liffey. .<br>  Most people live in the suburbs and commute to the city. There is the stereotype that the Northside of Dublin is working class, run down, and seedy, and the Southside is posh, wealthy and more respectable. South County Dublin is generally thought to be nicer, but consequently can also be snobby. Also, there are very expensive areas, particularly Dublin 4, but also more working class areas such as Tallaght and Crumlin. As for the Northside, areas such as Castleknock are very posh while others can be sketchy (Blanch, Coolock, Santry).<br>  Bottom line is since property is so expensive in Dublin county, you will pay steep prices to live in the "nicest" parts but if thats what you are looking for you should check out Dublin 4.<br>  Also, many people who want better value for their money have moved out of Dublin to places in the surrounding counties (ie: Wicklow, Wexford, Meath, etc). These areas are more rural, more spacious, and provide better value, but are close enough to commute.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)|`|nxzCseTmaa	Im from Greystones and trust me, its not 'old Ireland' at all...<br>  <br>  That said, its still really nice.

dDrhBnpxaa	Like you, I did not go abroad until 21 - a package holiday to Malta.<br>  <br>  Until then, my sole holiday experiences were visiting my father in Plymouth from the age of 6 onwards to 15. And I share some massively fond memories of the place.<br>  <br>  My dad used to live in an area called Plympton, which was a sub-urban part of the city, and had masses of parks, hills and greenery to explore. There were a lot of people my own age on my father's street, and every day was an adventure - making dens, riding bikes and having blackberry fights by a subway.<br>  <br>  My fondest memories though are of the seaside there. The Barbican was my favourite - we would go most weekends. There were many beach towns surrounding the area too - Paignton, Torbay, Torquay to name a few - and the smell of the salty sea, the slippery feeling of seaweed on your foot, the bits of sand in the burger - I can still feel and taste them all.<br>  <br>  Magical times. Another time, much older, I spent a holiday in Angle/Tenby - Pembrokeshire!!! Again, beautiful beaches in Tenby, and it really was like being abroad.<br>  <br>  There are many picturesque parts of the country that should be appreciated in full by more people.<br>  <br>  ***EDIT:- Perhaps they thought Carmarthenshire was more exotic? ;-/|`|GOpQsYHUaa	We always used to go to caravan parks in North Wales.<br>  Freezing cold beaches, sand in the sarnies, donkey rides etc.<br>  Great times.<br>  <br>  Best memory was when my dad who′s a singer won the Camp talent competition and we won a free week to go back for him to sing at the "Grand Final".

Certainly near Milton Keynes.<br>  <br>  Hostels in the UK are usually run by the Salvation Army for down and outs or there are Youth Hostels, usually for young people to take activity holidays.<br>  <br>  Hotels are offering some good deals at the moment, but cheap accommodation can often be found in what we call B&B or even pubs.<br>  <br>  Milton Keynes is what we call a 'New Town'. Purpose built after WWII to house the people bombed out of their homes or new couples and their families.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	It is about 36 miles from Disneyland to Universal, the #1 and #2 destinations in SoCal. Obviously, a car would not be too difficult, since there is no monorail or shuttle (Super Shuttle doesn't run from Anaheim to Studio City). You have these options:<br>  <br>  -Rent a car (varies, but you can get one for $30 per day and up)<br>  -Bus: Take Metro Bus 460 to Figueroa and Wilshire, then take the Red Line subway to Universal City. 3 hours, $3.70<br>  -Bus and train alternate: Walk to Harbor and Katella, the corner of the Disneyland property. Take OCTA bus 50 east to the Anaheim Stadium Amtrak Station. Then take Amtrak (www.amtrak.com) or Metrolink train (www.metrolink.com) to Union Station. From there, get on the Red Line Subway to Universal City. About 2 hours, 7.50<br>  <br>  Around Disneyland, you can visit Downtown Disney, the Anaheim Garden Walk, the Block at Orange, the Crystal Cathedral, Medieval Times Dinner Show, The Pirate Dinner Show, and Knott's Berry Farm. Check out www.socaltransport.org for assistance.<br>  <br>  Ripley's is about 7 miles from Disneyland. You can take the bus there.

xlVYvEg1aa	Well, it's all changing...<br>  I attended private high school few years ago ;) and we had uniforms - it was something different and we didn't dress like that everyday, just occasionally.<br>  <br>  In 2007 controversial Minister of Education Roman Giertych wanted all children wear the same uniforms at schools. First it was obligatory for primary schools and gimnazjum (which is not high school yet) but it was rather uniform shirts, pullovers or vests than uniforms.<br>  <br>  For high school - it depends on single school whether they decide for uniforms or not.<br>  <br>  Actually, it caused some problems... some people wanted their children dress uniforms, some not. Some couldn't afford it - prices could vary from one school to another. After all it started to be "fashion" problem...  see: <a href="http://fakty.interia.pl/galerie/kraj/w-czym-do-szkoly/zdjecie/duze,442840,1,269" rel="nofollow">http://fakty.interia.pl/galerie/kraj/w-c...</a><br>  <br>  In 2008 Sejm abolished obligatory uniforms and now if the director of single school chooses to dress children in uniform, he will have to ask parents and students for permission...<br>  <br>  if you want to see some pictures, google "mundurki w szkole" (uniforms at school) and see images<br>  <br>  greets|`|MfQGjzSvaa	There were some school uniforms a year ago but now it's back to no uniforms.

Just look for a teenager to interpret.<br>  <br>  They use the Zloty, much better than the Euro, as you can get about 3.7 per US$<br>  <br>  I was there early May, it was a bit chilly, rained an hour every afternoon, but was able to eat outdoors.<br>  <br>  There are hundreds of restaurants within a block of the market square so you should be able to find what you want.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Kraków is a great place to visit. <br>  <br>  Costs are about 1/2 what they are in places like France and Spain on the Euro.<br>  <br>  Most things are a short walk from the old market square, so stay near there if you can. As such, the old town it is full of old churches, gorgeous buildings, and a very large and vibrant town square lined with cafes. There are lots of classical music concerts. Visit St. Marys Cathedral and the other great churches in the old town. Walk up to Wawel hill and visit the Royal Cathedral and Palace. Take day trips to O?wi?cim (Auschwitz) and to the Wieliczka Salt Mine, and perhaps to the Eagle-nest Castles in the mountains. Visit the Museums. <br>  <br>  The most striking thing I remember from Kraków is the Kraków Hourly Trumpet Signal<br>  <br>  Every hour a golden trumpet shows above Kraków's central Grand Square in the west window just below the spire of the higher, municipal tower of the St. Mary's Basilica. Then a characteristic trumpet signal, known and dear to every Pole, played by a live trumpet player, resounds all over the city's Old Town historical district. All of a sudden the melody comes to an abrupt end. The Kraków signal, or Hejnal Mariacki, dates back to the Middle Ages when it announced the opening and the closing of the city gates. The bugler also played it to alarm his fellow citizens whenever he saw a fire or enemy forces. And the melody's abrupt ending is said to commemorate a bugler shot through his throat by a Tatar archer in 1241.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to rent a condo near the market square, inside the Planty. I had one last June, it was great, just a stone's throw from St. Mary's. The market square has several dozen outdoor cafe's, and there are hundreds of restaurants/bars within a block or two.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of Zywiec.<br>  <br>  Warsaw is worth a few days, for all of the WWII monuments, memorials, and memories, Getto museums and memories, plus the old town.

Some touristic sites MAY accept Euros, but not all.  I would suggest that you exchange the Euros for Zlotych, just to make your life easier while you are there.<br>  In March the weather is cold, it has been snowing there a lot lately, so I would pack really warm. Usually between -4 degrees up to 15 degrees Celsius.  <br>  Good luck with finding any vegetarian food.  Such a thing usually does not exist, because Polish food thrives on meat.  I mean, you can find things like mushroom soup, pierogis with cheese or with sauerkraut (they usually are sealed with pork -fat), but all of that would make a very scanty meal; it won't last very long. Sorry, but we thrive on meat, and we do not have spicy food either.|`|XwV1bar5aa	in krakow most museum and attraction workers and college aged people will speak limited english (it's sounds hylarious so try not to laugh :D)<br>  though they do officially accept euros most small businesses will only take zloty and grosze which is the currency<br>  in the weather is much like here (here being new jersey) but a little colder and wetter<br>  and the food is very interesting most dishes start out with a soup appatizer and then have either a meat course or something doughy and fried:) but everything's really good (just try whatever you're offered, yo won't regret it)<br>  have fun!|`|m1Kjxlkvaa	I have polish relatives, and a lot of polish people now speak english very well, the money is called zloty, I dont think they use euro yet,the weather can still be cold in March, but my relative lives further north from Kracow,the polish pronounce it kracof, my sister toured Poland, and she said the salt mines are a definate visit, so go there, as everything is carved out of salt, it is an amazing place, the food is different to ours,and they do eat a lot of veg.the buildings there are really beautiful, it is a lovely place I'm sure you will enjoy it,when you say hello.

rmS5DimSaa	I am not a native turk .. however, I have been learning the turkish language for 2 years. I am sure if I have mistakes .. native turk will correct me. <br>  <br>  I went - ben gittim<br>  you went - siz gittiniz(formal) sen gittin(informal)<br>  he/she went - o gitti <br>  we went - biz gittik<br>  you went - siz gittiniz<br>  they went - onlar gittilar<br>  <br>  <br>  I will go - ben gidece?im<br>  you will go - sen gideceksin<br>  he/she will go - o gidecek<br>  we will go - biz gidece?iz<br>  you will go - siz gideceksiniz<br>  they will go - onlar gidecekler<br>  <br>  There are several tenses in turkish, as well as vowel harmonies. vowel harmonies are dependent on hard / soft vowel sounds.  Turkish is very different from the english language due to sentence structures etc. <br>  <br>  There are 5 fundamental tenses in Turkish. These are:<br>  <br>     1.Present simple tense (Geni? zaman)<br>     2.Present continuous tense (?imdiki zaman)<br>     3.Future tense (Gelecek zaman)<br>     4.Past tense with -di (-di'li ge?mi? zaman) --> Regular past tense<br>     5. Past tense with -mi? (-mi?'li ge?mi? zaman) --> Also called the story past tense <br>  The suffix for present continuous tense is -iyor. Present continuous tense is used, very much like the one in English:<br>  <br>         To tell what you are currently doing<br>  <br>            I am working now. --> ?imdi ?al???yorum.<br>            I am eating ice cream. --> Dondurma yiyorum.<br>  <br>        To tell something you will do in the close future<br>  <br>            Wait, I'm coming in 5 minutes. --> Bekle, 5 dakika i?inde geliyorum. <br>  <br>  There is no suffix for the regular past tense. The only point is that you must use the past tense form of to be. Be careful about the harmony rules though, as always. The use of the past tense with -di is almost the same as the English past tense.<br>  <br>  To tell an action that took place in the past.<br>  <br>  He came. --> Geldi.<br>  To make a statement that was true in the past.<br>  She was beautiful. --> Güzeldi.<br>  <br>  Future tense of a verb is constructed this way:<br>  <br>      verb root + (negative) + ecek + present tense to be<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  When you want to append the suffix -ecek to a verb that ends with a vowel, you add the fusion consonant 'y' between the verb and the suffix to separate the two vowels. Otherwise, just simply add the suffix -ecek. Be careful about the harmony rules though, as always. Let's see how future tense is obtained using some example verbs:<br>  <br>      gel-ecek --> gelecek --> he will come<br>      git-ecek-im --> gidece?im --> I will go<br>      oku-ecek-sin --> okuyacaks?n --> you will read<br>      kapat-ecek-iz --> kapataca??z --> we will close<br>      ko?-ecek-siniz --> ko?acaks?n?z --> you will run (plural you)<br>      ara-ecek-ler --> arayacaklar --> they will call<br>      konu?-me-ecek --> konu?mayacak --> he will not talk<br>      ver-me-ecek-sin --> vermeyeceksin --> you will not give<br>  <br>  as you can see the tenses go hand in hand with vowel and consenant harmonies - all of which must be learned together and can become very confusing.<br>  <br>  difference between peki & tamam are as follows: <br>  peki<br>  <br>  1. All right./Okay./Very well.<br>  2. If that's so, then ...?: Peki, ne yaps?n? If that's so, then what can he do?<br>  <br>  tamam<br>  <br>  1. all (of the), the whole (of the): Binan?n tamam? yand?. The whole building burned down.<br>  2. complete, not lacking in any part.<br>  3. ready; complete; finished.<br>  4. correct, free of mistakes: Hesaplar?n?z tamam. Your arithmetic is correct.<br>  5. O.K.!/All right!/Very well!<br>  6. used to express displeasure sarcastically: Tamam, bir bu eksikti! Great! This is all I need!<br>  7. fully; for all of, for a whole: Tamam on gün sürdü. It went on all of ten days. <br>  Plus there are many more ways to use tamam. Whilst in Turkiye I heard "tamam" more than "peki" <br>  <br>  difference between evet and tabii are as follows: <br>  <br>  tabii<br>  <br>  1. natural, pertaining to nature.<br>  2. natural, unaffected.<br>  3. habitual, customary.<br>  4. pure, unadulterated.<br>  5. naturally, of course. <br>  <br>  evet<br>  ,-ti yes, certainly.<br>  <br>  __ efendimci yes-man. it becomes evet efendimci - efendim is a polite way of responding to someone that says your name.

Each party is allowed time to use the property.<br>  For example...   Multiple people buy the same exact room/place you bought and then each person that holds a "share" of the place has to pick a certain time to use it.<br>  Take for example a condo in Cancun.  Let's say you own a share to it, someone else, and someone else.  You all have the right to use it, but no single person owns it.  You each pick certain times of the year you want to use it.<br>  <br>  They can be for resorts, condos, camping grounds, lake houses, beach houses, etc., etc. .<br>  <br>  The reason you are hearing a lot about it for Cancun is that in Cancun there is always someone trying to get you to buy one of these properties.  Some people love them but most people hate them.  You have to be VERY careful.  Some resorts offer a timeshare presentation and usually give you a free gift for attending.  They will try to get you to buy one.  Don't EVER sign any paper if you sit through one of these timeshare presentations if you don't plan on buying one. <br>  I've heard countless stories of people signing papers and were actually signing contracts to purchase one and not knowing it then they get billed for it.  They are VERY difficult to get out of.<br>  If someone offers you a timeshare presentation just say no thanks and keep walking.|`|eYFRKmPOaa	There are several terms that you must understand. I could write for hours about this. The first is Vacation Ownership. All sales reps want you to use this term. Psychologically they are attempting to change the bad impressions of timeshare to a positive one just by using a different name. Vacation ownership makes you feel like you will own your vacations for the rest of your life and your children’s life. Sound familiar to anyone? Another name is Fractional ownership. All that means is that the time that you have in a certain condo is divided fractionally between several owners, i.e. the term timeshare.<br>  <br>  Timeshare programs give the owner the ability to use their week, or points to set a vacation in the location of your preference in the time period you choose. If there is no resort in a location you want, you can use an exchange service to find a location anywhere in the world. Obviously, there is a fee associated with an exchange. One way to do this is what is called a fixed week. This means that the owner owns a certain week in a resort every year. The location is fixed to a particular condo as well. If you owned a week at Myrtle Beach, you would go to the same resort, and the same condo every year at the same time. Fixed weeks then transformed into floating weeks which meant that you could choose the week, but you would still go to the same resort and condo every year. Now the industry has changed to a points system.<br>  <br>  Points have become good and bad for the industry, and for the consumer as well. the problem is that for those that own a fixed or floating week have a harder time exchanging into a different resort. The other problem is that when they do exchange into a points resort, they become bait for the sale vultures. They will be told that fixed weeks are a thing of the past and in the near future they will not be able to use their timeshare. This is absolutely false, but the timeshare industry trains their sales reps to push this hard. For many fixed week owners they are made to feel as second class citizens and are often dealt with harshly.|`|sby0C51haa	Timeshare at its core is essentially a group of people sharing the cost of a vacation home.<br>  <br>  The word "timeshare" has grown over the decades to include a wide variety of vacation products and plans. Also known as "vacation ownership" "holiday ownership" and "interval ownership" , its umbrella covers traditional deeded timeshare ownership, fractional ownership, private residence clubs, points clubs, and more. Some would even broaden the term further to include campground memberships and the " condo hotel" concept, in which a condo is purchased outright but the owner is only allowed to use it for a specific periods of time and it is rented by a hotel management company for the remainder of the time.<br>  <br>  Regardless of how loosely or rigidly you choose to define the term, the basic premise of timeshare is simple. You and a group of other people share the purchase cost of a vacation accommodation, in increments of one week (or more) per year of use, thus guaranteeing your ability to use that accommodation during the period of time you choose, either for life or for a specified number of years. Accommodations range from hotel rooms to condos, from cabins to luxury houses and castles, from yachts and cruise ships to RVs and houseboats.Owning timeshare in the traditional sense means a condominium/villa/house/hotel unit, etc. is subdivided into 52 separate units of time (52 weeks in 1 year), and usually sold to a maximum of 51 owners (leaving one week each year closed down for annual renovations and/or maintenance). Each owner would own 1/51 of the unit. Each share repesents one week of vacation. Each owner is entitled to ownership rights and privileges of the shares that they purchased.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Most time shares are scams that sell you a few weeks a year at the same resort at the same time year after year. They claim they will rent your unit the rest of the time, but somehow that never happens. <br>  <br>  Timeshare salespeople are getting really desperate because fewer people are being suckered in so they are incredibly pushy.
VjPnHxZyaa	Otay is an area along the Tijuana/San Diego Border.  There is really not a city of Otay as it encompasses San Ysidro, Chula Vista and South San Diego.  There is also an area built up as Eastlake and is a residential area that is in the Otay Mesa area.  There is a large industrial area there mostly trucking companies as the otay border crossing is in the area.  At one time it was mostly farmland but no longer.  The closest military base is located in Imperial beach an area west of Otay Mesa anywhere from 5-10 miles away.  The closest indian reservation is Syucuan, which is part of Kumeyaay indian tribe.  traveling to Sycuan where there is a gambling casino is about a half an hour drive from the Otay mesa area.

Having said that, you really need to discover whether Brisbane is hip and happening enough for you.  We tend to get a lot of flack from our southern counterparts (Sydney and Melbourne) for being too quiet - and yes, we are quiet.  Some places in Brisbane are very 'asleep' after 10.00 on a Saturday night - inner city suburbs known for restaurants etc. <br>  <br>  Having said that - there are the party places - I just don't know them very well - the Valley etc.  <br>  <br>  My main concern for you deciding to live in Brisbane is the social aspect.

szwFTvNaaa	I think they do, airlines charge anything that breathe nowadays.
5DnHABmPaa	Not usually.  Most airlines have a policy that the child must be under 2, and then the child must sit in an adult's lap.  Further, there can only be one lap-child per row of seats, so keep that in mind if flying with more than one baby.  If you put the baby/toddler in a car seat, then you must pay a full fare.  If the child is older than 2, he requires his own seat and you must pay a full fare.<br>  <br>  However...  There are airline specials where a kid can fly free with a paying adult.  These are usually limited-time and/or only for certain destinations (usually to the Disneyland or Disney World areas).   You can find details about these on booking websites.

TthDWtPTaa	Your gma is an idiot.<br>  Yes, of course they will check your Passport, and you will NOT be allowed in the over 18 clubs.|`|94b8KImYaa	Yes your Passport is checked word by word, since this is how the ship generates the passenger list - which is needed for clearance out of the port and into any port. And they need to go by the date in your ID - not the one you gave them. <br>  <br>  Your age itself is not printed on your cruise card, but is contained in the magnetic strip. So the computer would have a block on your card - due to your age. <br>  <br>  wishing you a good cruise.|`|X6rFPI2laa	Your passport is the document they will use for your ID, and you will NOT be allowed into any area you are in fact too young to be.

They have to because you have to go through customs in many areas and they can and will incur hefty fines or lose their cruising privileges for not doing so.<br>  <br>  Best be honest up front and explain the situation.

Its an extremly interesting place steeped in history. I used to go there twice a week (travelling from Liverpool) at my old job and never felt under threat. I think you would be very welcome being American as well as a lot of Immigrants came from Ireland to America. The only place I personally never felt comfortable was in South Armagh. But thats just me.

Parks and Rec have T-Ball programs for 3-5 year olds at Beaches Recreation Centre (spring session), Mary McCormick Recreation Centre (summer session), Trinity Bellwoods Park (spring session), Wallace Emerson Community Centre (summer session), Withrow Clubhouse (Logan and Danforth) (spring session). Most cost around $20-$30 for 9 weeks or so.  Registration is March 11th, beginning at 7 AM either online or by phone. You'll need the program number and a family/participant registration number to register.

FF6OsSq5aa	I disagree. I was in Bulgaria for the entire month of January this year visiting my boyfriend, and I thought the country, even in the middle of winter, was BEAUTIFUL. He lives in the Rhodopes near the Pamporovo Ski Resort, and I thought the forests and mountains were very pretty. As for being dirty? Yes, there is a problem with people just throwing their trash out of car windows, ending up clogging the beautiful rivers and streams, but what country doesn't have a similar issue? I have been all over the world, and I personally think Bulgaria has A TON to offer. The people are gracious and hospitable, the land is beautiful, the history is incredible, the language is unique, and best of all, it is not a huge, commercialized tourism hot spot (not yet anyway), which is what I loved the most! Anyway, I LOVE BULGARIA (and not just because my future husband is Bulgarian!).|`|HX0kOGgraa	I'm not Bulgarian but I've been there and there's nothing interesting, it's very dirty...|`|dibF7WSxaa	it looks so poor, dirty and gay... as Albania, FYROM or Turkey|`|uXlltVWZaa	Bulgaria is very beautiful just as FYROM, Albania and Turkey...

AA10049824	No. There are no Starbucks inside SFO at all. Probably one of the few places in America without them. With the exception of a single Burger King and Subway inside Terminal 3 (United and American domestic flights), most of the concessions at SFO are branches of San Francisco eateries. <br>  <br>  The airport authority has contracted with locally owned businesses like Peet's Coffee and Tea. The menu is basically the same as Starbucks though. So, just order your usual Starbucks drink. Chances are they'll have it.<br>  <br>  Southwest departs from Terminal 1 (where there are two Peet's coffee shops).|`|EJpiaCMQaa	None at San Francisco Airport.  Grab your coffee before you get to the airport and drink it fast.  There are plenty of Starbucks Coffees located near the airport.  San Bruno, Daly City, Burlingame, and Millbrae have several of them.

2EVoNHHbaa	Actually, you can get a tour of the Capitol without an advance reservation.  Reservations are only needed if you want a "VIP" tour organized through your Congressman or Senator.<br>  <br>  You can order tickets for the Holocaust Museum in advance to ensure that you'll be able to enter at the time you want.<br>  <br>  And you know about the White House---at this point you're probably too late to obtain tickets.<br>  <br>  I can't think of anything else....|`|wwzoqIvVaa	Spy Museum is all I can think of.|`|I20mtK1Oaa	If you want to see a play or concert while you're here, I'd suggest booking in advance for prime seats.  Although they also have great last minute ticket offers at most places as long as the show isn't sold out.<br>  <br>  In addition to the Holocaust Museum, the Spy Museum also takes advance reservations so that you can walk in at a certain time.  If you plan to go the Spy Museum, go there in the morning and purchase a ticket for the time you want to go in.  In high tourist season (April-June), those tickets can sellout for the day by lunchtime.<br>  <br>  Have a good trip!
g8LLIeXKaa	The Statue of Liberty requires reservation for a visitor to go inside the Monument.<br>  Since they have a limited number of "Monument Access" passes, reserve it very early.<br>  Why?

However, if you don't have a particular show in mind you can get 1/2 price tickets for shows that have available seating for that same night.<br>  If you want to go to the top of the base of the Statue of Liberty and into the Statue museum then you have to have reserve tickets and ask for the free Monument Pass.  A ticket cost $17 and covers the ferry, the Statue & Ellis Island.  The number to call is 877-523-9859.<br>  If you want tickets for either of these get them ASAP. Nothing else requires advance tickets. Have fun!

If I were you guys, I would get a hotel on the strip but that is cheaper (maybe downtown or Stratosphere or Imperial Palace)  I know they are not the nicest, but most likely you wont be staying there much.  Secondly, my friend and I did the "time share" thing at Harrah's hotel.  BORING as heck, but you will get two free shows and two free meals out of it!  We saw the Vinnie Favorito show (HILARIOUS) and then we went and seen the Thunder From Down Under which is totally worth $50 a ticket!  For cheap eats...I would suggest going downtown on the strip for the buffets.  You can get a daily pass on the bus for like $5 or you can get a week deal too, but I cant remember how much they are.  Just walk around all of the hotel/casinos and sightsee and you will have a blast!|`|7daa4395d6746a1f7a17271acac3f945aa	Dannin79,<br>  <br>  Do a search on the search engines and you will see quite a few deals right now.

q3qJIC5raa	With $400 designer shopping is not practical; often on epiece will sell for that.  H&M is very popular and the prices are so much less.  You can easily put an outfit together for $100 or less. (34th and Sixth and 53rd and Fifth)  <br>  <br>  For food, some restaurants are astronomical.  For more reasonable fare try Ninth Ave between 42 and f7th street.  It is only a block over from the Times Square area, but you get better food for less money.  For real cheap, I recommend Manganaro's on Ninth and 37th street or any of those Papaya/hot dog places.  Find them at 42d and Ninth, 37th and seventh, 9th street and sixth ave, 5th street and sixth ave.  These are all close to places that you are likely to be.  You could make street food part of your NY experience, too.  There are food carts all over the place with all kinds of cuisine.  I would suggest that you look for the lines of people that will indicate the best food and the best deals.<br>  <br>  NYC is famous for its pizza.

China Town is more on the affordable side, but if your looking for Italian Cuisine, than depending on per person ordering, its going to be 20-30$ per plate. 5th avenue is famous for its lavish brand named stores, so depending on what your looking for, like Gucci, its going to be pricey. Johns pizzeria - 260 W 44th St, New York, NY? - (212) 391-7560?, inexpensive, and great reviews. You have to check out the diners around NYC.  Stardust Diner? - 1650 Broadway, New York, NY? - (212) 586-8818?, GREAT portions, and inexpensive. And for your splurging pleasure: Strip House?-13 E 12th St, New York, NY? - (212) 328-0000?, and the famous, and I recommend trying, SARDI's - 234 W 44th St. If i were you, i would bring 500$ but don't expect to buy anything from Tiffany's or Louis Vuitton.|`|2Cn1UFrpaa	depends on what you do,, keep it cheap and spend 200

de4e9edcd9db63bdf2eb13b6a3532830aa	?Each of the Hawaiian Islands has its own personality and character.  So, knowing what type of person you are and what you like to do will help you decide which of the islands you will like.<br>  <br>  If you like tourists and fishing you should like the Kona area of the “Big Island” of Hawaii.<br>  If you like solitude, a tropical feel, a rural atmosphere and you don’t mind rain, you should like the Hilo area of the Big Island.  The west side of the Big Island has a few nice small beaches, including black sand beaches.  Near Ka Lae, the southernmost point of the island you will find a green sand beach.  Big beaches are not prevalent on the Big Island.<br>  <br>  If you enjoy scenery, hiking, snorkeling, kayaking or surfing and don’t yearn for “night life”<br>  then the oldest of the islands, Kauai is for you.<br>  <br>  If you are the kind of person who keep a bathing suit, snorkel gear or a surfboard in your car, then Maui is for you, because it has 120 miles of easily accessible and swimmable coastline, more than any other island.<br>  <br>  If you have an artistic temperament or perhaps you like to get away and write, then seek out the island of Lanai.<br>  <br>  If you love nature, hiking and solitude, then “the most Hawaiian” of the islands, Molokai is for you.<br>  <br>  You’ll enjoy Oahu if you like beaches, shopping, tourists, high-rises, traffic and don’t mind a lot of other people.  Honolulu is like a tropical version of NYC, or LA as it was in the smog-free 1950's.|`|uHs6VSmjaa	It depends on what kind of vacation youre looking for. If you enjoy nightlife and lots of action, youre better off in Honolulu.<br>  <br>  <br>  If youre looking for relaxation, gorgeous beaches, surfing or boogieboarding, good restaurants, incredible golf courses, snorkeling, whale watching and sunsets like youve never seen before, go to Maui, Ive traveled alot, and still come back to Maui when I need all of the above. It truly is paradise.|`|QQbSIrBxaa	Depends on what you want to do.  If you just want to sit on a beach and relax Oahu.  But if you want to do other activities besides sit on the beach and shop then Maui.  Personally I liked Kauai the best but I like to hike more than relax at a beach on vacation.|`|WR8eKYzfaa	Maui|`|JqVU84yLaa	maui|`|MmgNDqOQaa	u should go to oahu. i live there its fun i love the beaches especially waimea bay u can jump off rocks|`|3z6lwCHuaa	Maui, never heard of the ither one, =/|`|XCPctxGHaa	maui<br>  <br>  i heard of it :)|`|7PMpJqiiaa	Maui is a quintessential American tropical paradise.  Most of the tourists are from the mainland USA and there are less international tourists here compared to Oahu.  The resort areas are perfect, but are RESORT areas, i.e., there is less cultural ambience since the beaches are lined one after the other with beautiful resorts, with less cultural towns and activities near the resorts.  There is no big city on Maui.  Highlights include driving the road to Hana along the sea cliffs through the rain forest with beautiful tropical waterfalls and bamboo forests at every turn, diving with sea turtles at Turtle Town or Napili Bay, or going on a cruise to Molokini, a sunken caldera off the coast filled with coral.<br>  <br>  Oahu has the only real "big city" and 80% of the locals live on this island.  The traffic is awful (although I have to say the traffic in Maui is getting pretty tight too because they have less roads!).  Oahu is also the true melting pot of the islands, with more international people and international tourists particularly from Asia (Japan, Korea).  A lot of military influence here, and of course Pearl Harbor.  The best shopping, diverse restaurants, the best museums, the most history, activities and sites are here.   Oahu has the most beaches and the most surfers.  You have the urban beach and nightlife of Waikiki, but you can drive to the windward side for empty, lonely tropical beaches if you wish, or up to the North Shore for a campy casual surfer beach atmosphere.  Beautiful tropical hikes to waterfalls and the jungle, hike up Diamond Head but no matter where you go, you will never be absolutely alone if that is what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  If this was my first time, and I were to choose one island however, I would choose Oahu as an introduction to Hawaii.  It has a little bit of each of the other islands.  But airfare, especially right now, is incredibly cheap, why not go to two islands?  You can fly into one island and out the other, the connector is less than $100 to hop from one island to the other.

AA10042296	Fastest way to Palenque is to fly from Mexico City to Villahermosa.  Then you can rent a car or find a guide to drive you an hour and a half to Palenque.  While in Villahermosa, be sure to see the Parque Museo La Venta with lots of heads and altars for the archaeological site of La Venta.  <br>  A flight from DF to Villahermosa is probably under two hours; a flight from Villahermosa to Merida is probably under and hour.  If you decided to spend the night in Palenque town and drive to Merida it would be a 6 to 7 hour drive.  But by driving straight there, you would miss many ruins along the way, like Edzna, Uxmal, Kabah, Labna and Sayil.

HziXc5Ovaa	It is safe for you even as an American to travel to Cuba. Cuba is not like Mexico. However, bringing your car to Cuba with a trailer won't work.<br>  <br>  But you can travel to Cuba via sailing. These are the specfications for such travel:<br>  If you are sailing to Cuba, be sure to contact port authorities before you reach jurisdictional waters (12 miles from the base line). Use these communication channels: <br>  <br>  -HF (SSB) channel 2760 (national coastal network) and 2790 (tourism network); or<br>  -VHF channel 68 (national coastal network) and 16 (tourism network).<br>  <br>  Port authorities will ask you for the following information: <br>  <br>  -name of yacht <br>  -flag <br>  -port of registry <br>  -last port of call<br>  -port of arrival<br>  -estimated time of arrival (ETA)<br>  -type of craft<br>  -colour of craft <br>  -number of persons on board. <br>  <br>  You must follow the instructions given by the port authorities and remain on board until all legal formalities are concluded. <br>  <a href="http://www.gocuba.ca/en/travelTips.asp#1" rel="nofollow">http://www.gocuba.ca/en/travelTips.asp#1</a><br>  <br>  Ports of entry: <br>  <br>  Cuba welcomes sailors from around the world.

Good luck.|`|SeJ1Hnfraa	Hello Dear<br>  There is no way to import your car to Cuba for a holiday, so the only option left if you want to do some driving in Cuba is to rent a car.  You will typically have the option of driving five or six different models of car, that are usually either old American cars from before the revolution in Cuba, or newer Korean and Japanese cars. You can expect to pay around $50 per day of driving in Cuba, with discounts for long term rentals. The other main driving expense is fuel which is easy enough to find at main towns. Many people who choose the driving option in Cuba also tend to pay a dollar or so per night to a parking attendant who will keep an eye on the car to make sure nobody steals it or damages it. There are also some highways in Cuba that exact a toll of about $2 for driving on it.<br>  <br>  Cuba has some of the best driving and road conditions in Latin America. Because of sanctions, most people in Cuba cannot afford cars, which means driving in Cuba is quite a pleasant experience due to the lack of traffic. All major routes are well maintained although there are sometimes small patches on long routes that haven’t been recently repaired and caution is advised while driving on these bumpy parts.  Cuba uses internationally recognised driving and traffic symbols although roads are not always signposted very well making it important to run through your route in Cuba before you commence driving.  Cuba has a lot of cyclists who sometimes ride in the middle of the road, so one should be patient and slow down when faced with such a situation while driving. Driving in Cuba occurs on the right hand side of the road and the use of seat belts while driving is optional. The speed limit for driving on freeways in Cuba is 100km p/h, while the driving limit in urban areas is 50km p/h.  Speeding tickets are usually issued on the spot and cost $10 which is then deducted from the car rental deposit.<br>  Best of luck!

For example: buy a cute foam, magnetic frame, and some stickers, and put a picture of your daughter and her friends, and then she can make them for her friends, and they can put them in their lockers at school) <br>  <br>  -Buy some treats at the Dollar Store or something like that, and again, give them to her periodically during the flight.<br>  <br>  -Bring a travel dry- erase board, and some dry- erase markers- that may be fun for her to "doodle" with, and hey, it saves paper! :) <br>  <br>  -Have a great flight- I hope this helps!|`|vITZgKthaa	You can do many things ..you have options for electronic devices or simply read a interesting book that is going to keep you awake :]<br>  <br>  tell a story to a person besides you <br>  Good luck
aa1OGptZaa	NIagara falls in beautiful you should reserve now the prices are cheaper farther in advance you can always cancel if plans change. Crowne Plaza is a nice reasonably priced hotel they have fallsview and no  view. If on a budget the view is nice but how often will you really look out the window when in the room. You'll probably be asleep.<br>  The hotels on this site are decent. I have stayed at Crowne Plaza and Sheraton on the Falls. <a href="http://www.niagarafallshotels.com/index.php?" rel="nofollow">http://www.niagarafallshotels.com/index....</a><br>  <br>  Depends how much you want to do(and spend) but for 2 adults I think 2 or 3 nights is enough. You should take the Maid of the Mist boat ride, Journey Behind the Falls at Tablerock is nice, casinos, Whirlpool Aero Car, if you have a car drive along the river there is a powerplant tour, gardens, butterfly house. <a href="http://www.niagarafallslive.com/Attractions_in_Niagara_Falls.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.niagarafallslive.com/Attracti...</a><br>  <br>  New York is right across the river you can take a 10 minute walk over the bridge into NY. Can't see the falls very well from this side.<br>  If you are going to Canada from the US starting June 1st you will need a passport.<br>  <br>  Take lots of money food-attractions are not cheap. <br>  <br>  Most shops on Clifton Hill it's not a long walk I think your husband will be okay besides one way is down hill so once you walk up hill you're good.<br>  Don't forget to take a camera, they shine colored lights on the falls at night.Have fun.|`|4cHP4XtHaa	Well, many people don't understand the make up of the falls and sides and whatnot and that's ok, let me explain. If you are a US citizen driving over the border then you have to be in New York in order to cross over, if your flying then you ll fly in, but once you get into Niagara Falls, Ontario right across the bridge is New York and Niagara Falls, NY its 5 minutes away and there are some but not many things to do on the NY side don't spend more than one day on the American side. All of the activity is on the Canadian side and living on the American side I do find it hard to say but its the truth. There are many things to do in the falls, there is the Maid of the Mist, Marineland, Table Rock, Journey Behind the Falls, Cave of the Winds(American Side but not to be missed), and of course the Casinos one on the American side Seneca Niagara Casino & Hotel and two on the canadian. It is truly worth it to get a hotel with a view the Marriott, Embassy Suites and the Hilton are nice but for a cheaper option with a nce view go to Micheal's Inn. For any more info on these attractions just google them. 1 week 6 days 5 nights wouldd do just fine.|`|SGdgDkKeaa	Stay away from Niagara Falls...I have lived here for my whole life. The only thing to do is Clifton Hill unless you want to see Marineland which is bassically whales swimming in a fish tank. The owner of Marine land is cruel to his animals...why pay to support it. He feeds the bears garbage from the kitchen....will shoot a deer every now and again and throw it in with them...so cruel. I will be relocating a soon as I get the money....I would go to Toronto...alot more interesting...all Niagara Falls is is a money trap...|`|JCFygI5gaa	Generally you can see and do everything there is within a week. There are some beautiful hotels overlooking the Falls, but they are usually upwards of 200 dollars a night, even higher during the summer months. Personally, I don't think it's worth the money. You can stay in other nice hotels and take a 5-10 minute walk down to the Falls.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of tourist attractions down near the waterfalls themselves. Two casinos, abundance of nice restaurants and bars, small museums, giant ferris wheel, gentle boat ride, gardens, etc.<br>  <br>  As for the American side, the view is not as impressive, and there is not as much to do. There is one casino and an observation deck, and a hot air balloon ride I believe. Niagara Falls, NY is only a 5-10 minute drive. Buffalo, NY is around a 30 minute drive.|`|3dW0GQNYaa	If your husband has problems walking, especially long distances or up and down hills, then Niagara Falls may not be the place for you.  The good thing about the NF area is that most of the sights are within walking distance (less than 1 mile).  However, if your husband has trouble walking, that would be a problem.  For instance, the person who suggested Clifton Hill probably gave you the worst possible advice as it is quite steep and probably would not be good for your husband.|`|Waj5VTtVaa	Here try this website..it is on clifton hill but that is still in that area.Also there is Marineland

f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	Rachel, New York City is "The City That Never Sleep," meaning there is always something going on in this city 24 hours day, 7 days a week.<br>  <br>  Is it dangerous to attend college in New Yorker City, the answer to that is no. New York City has the lowest crime rate since the NYPD began to keep crime statistics in 1963. Besides, for the first two months of 2009, the crime rate has drop 14%. That makes NYC one of the safes cities in America.<br>  <br>  I hope this information is very helpful.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  Native New Yorker|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	New York is known to have a wild atmosphere?  Where is this known?  Out on the prairie somewhere?<br>  Oh, honey, you have gotten a very wrong idea of New York City.  The average New Yorker is a very normal, average person who works hard and then wants to go home and relax.  Most people don't want to bother anybody.  <br>  NYC is not even close to the most dangerous city in the United States, and t's gotten much safer in the past decade or two.  If you want to study fashion, it's the only place to go.  <br>  Why not schedule some tours of schools you're interested in and make a trip here?

Compare as many travel websites as you can as often as you can. Since you have a few months, start searching today and search the flights or hotels or whatever you need every week until the month before you are going. If anything is unusually cheaper, book it on that date. I would definitely recommend checking out the website BookMe. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck and check out the link below, and you will be all set.

DHczAdHIaa	I've been going there for 20 years, sometimes as many as 4 times per year, and never get tired of the place.  There is something for everybody and you may find that you don't even want to leave the place, to go elsewhere. <br>  The attractions of Benalmadena are many but the main one's would be:<br>  The Marina - probably the best in Spain, maybe Europe.  There are many great restaurants, shops, bars and clubs for nightlife.  The boats are well worth a look and the water is teeming with fish, which you can feed. <br>  Sealife centre - situated in the Marina.<br>  Paloma Park - a vast landscaped park, with a large lake and fountain, animals running freely as well as others in an enclosure.  There are a couple of cafe bars, a childrens play park, & a large Cactus Park.  It really is a lovely place to spend a few hours.<br>  Selwo Marina - alongside Paloma Park, with Dolphin, sea lion and penguin shows.<br>  Tivoli World - in Arroyo de la Miel, which is the the commercial area of Benalmadena and a lovely town with a very Spanish feel.  Tivoli is an amusement park with rides and show.  Great for kids and adults alike.<br>  Cable car - situated by Tivoli and takes you to the top of Monte Calamorro.  If you don't mind heights this is something not to be missed.  At the top there is a great collection of birds of prey & displays take place at various times of the day.  Choose a clear day for this trip as the views are magnificent.<br>  Benalmadena Pueblo - the third part of Benalmadena is the original little white village and a lovely place to see.<br>  The beach promenade is itself a wonderful attraction with many great restaurants, bars and little gift shops.<br>  Eating out is a treat and can still be done very reasonably, with Arroyo and the Bonanza Square area being among my favourites.   For entertainment, there are professional acts every night in places like the Bonanza Bar, El Efefante, and Busby's.   There are also karaoke bars, clubs in 24hr Square and the Marina & a Casino, too, if you enjoy a gamble. <br>  A train runs from Malaga to Fuengirola, it's frequent, cheap & the station is by Tivoli in Arroyo.  The local buses are also very cheap, taxis are reasonable too, so a car is unnecessary.<br>  You will see that I haven't even been out of Benalmadena yet but if you do wish to leave it, Mijas, Gibraltar, Ronda, the lakes above El Chorro, Granada and Malaga itself are all worth a visit.   Next door in Torremolinos there is a water park and a Spanish Horse show (Wednes. evenings I think).<br>  My next visit is in 2 weeks time and, as you may gather, I can't wait.<br>  The link below gives the best guide to the area, in my opinion, telling you all you need to know.<br>  Have a great holiday.|`|TPVvddHWaa	Been there a lot. You will wish you had not asked after reading this lot.<br>  <br>  It rather depends on what you like to do. But we found that there are free blanket trips, you have to listen to a sales pitch for an hour but the trips out are full day ones, free and worth taking. Leave a tip for the courier on your way out though. You may get an free extra trip for it.<br>  <br>  Otherwise there is a lovely Marina and you can walk all along the front for miles, they are planning to organise it so that you can walk from Malaga all along and it will take about three days to do the whole thing.<br>  <br>  You can take buses from the station and get to loads of other places for an inexpensive day out. Marbella, Puerto Banus, Torremolinos Malaga, Fuingerolla and inland Mijas is a lovely place well worth going. Gibraltar, daily coach trips from Bucket shops or the Thomson rep but that is dearer. There is a decent train service too. <br>  <br>  Nerja is along the coast, pretty little place, change buses at Malaga.<br>  <br>  The worst thing is the time share touts. If you are a couple/family you could well be harrassed to the point that you end up going out separately. One reason we avoid the area. Do not buy one or even think of going to the presentation no matter what they offer you. If you want a time share you can get them free on line from people only too pleased to get rid of them to be released from the annual service charge.<br>  <br>  If you are self catering go to the Euroski supermarket for supplies. They are the cheapest a bit like ASDA or Tesco. They do good quality own brand goods. Nice cakes and bread. One shop, taxi back with the shopping it is still worth it. Make a plan before you go, like a menu.<br>  <br>  Spain is expensive with the Euro as it is at the moment but if you are on half board, it wont be too bad. Eating out costs a lot and drinking isn't cheap like it once was. So be prepared to make your own meals if you are self catering.<br>  <br>  I usually take things like instant mash or rice and things which are dried so they do not weigh much, a plastic measuring jug, then get fresh meat and salad veg. Buy a bottle of wine and enjoy a meal on the balcony then go out for the evening. The bread is lovely I think and the Spanish cheeses and cerano ham is better than Palma, the salamis are great too.  It does not take long to make a sandwich. I also take some plastic bags, a 25p roll from Asda. Always useful.  Even on half board, you can make a sandwich to take out with you at breakfast. Be discreet and pop it into your bag.<br>  <br>  Yeh I know I am a cheapskate but I have seen Brits on holiday refusing to cook but short of cash trying to pretend they are enjoying a plate of badly cooked frozen chips at a British bar so often I always think that they could have enjoyed their holiday so much more with just a tiny bit of thought and preparation before hand.<br>  <br>  If you smoke, English brands of cigarettes and tobacco are cheaper and you can bring quite a few back. They keep well so you could use them as Christmas gifts for family. Of course it is illegal to sell them on so you are not allowed to sell what you buy to friends when you get home.<br>  <br>  There are loads of different places to go to at night, you might have entertainment where you are staying but some of it is, not always of a high standard.<br>  <br>  You can get a boat accross to Africa on a day trip but be warned if you have taken a Europe only travel insurance you wont be covered. Take the up to date version of the E111 just in case you need emergency treatment. If you are taken ill, try the pharmacist first, they can sell a lot of drugs over the counter, some will sell antibiotics even. Their pharmacists who own their own shops are very highly qualified and can offer just as good advice as a lot of doctors.<br>  <br>  Mosquitos are not usually a problem but can be so if you think you need to, take repellent.<br>  <br>  Look for tourist information, they have free maps bus time tables and sometimes have offers like half price for local attractions. The staff are helpful.<br>  <br>  Markets are rubbish now, they seem to have the sort of cheap Chinese imports you can buy anywhere. Don't expect to get bargains department stores will have the same stuff a lot cheaper.<br>  <br>  Take your own mobile phone for phoning home too. It is cheaper in most cases than using public phones or getting a card (commission is another rep's perk) . Just make brief calls. Even pay as you go ones cost less than public phones and room phones are prohibitive. Enquire with your service provider about the charge for things and texts, you may have to pay to receive & for answer phone messages made to you once you have tuned into the Spanish network. <br>  <br>  Those sun loungers on the beach can be expensive. I suggest you use the ones round the pool.

xIHgTqVhaa	I'm a former Flight Attendant and I now fly a lot with my three children.<br>  <br>  Where to start? <br>  <br>  For a formula fed baby, I really recommend using the bottles with plastic liners. Traditional bottles are too difficult to wash onboard because of the kind of sinks on airplanes. I premeasured the powder and rolled them up, placing the rolls in a ziplock bag. Then I threw the liners away as I used them and only had the ring and nipple to clean.<br>  <br>  Be sure your baby does not need the bottle warmed. Get him used to a room-temperature bottle before leaving. This is unnecessary health-wise and a real pain to do while travelling. I warmed many bottles on my flights but I wasn't there in the check-in line, the security line or the waiting area! Babies do great with room-temperature bottles. <br>  <br>  Assuming he can stand with support, I suggest learning to change him in this position. I was given this tip and *loved* it. No more searching baby changers in public, no more trying to keep babies on them. Practice at home first but once you get it down, your life in general will be easier. Airplane changing tables are small.<br>  <br>  I suggest about 1/3 more supplies than he usually uses in that time period. Babies go through more diapers when flying for a number of reasons. <br>  <br>  I really recommend that he have his own seat and that you bring his car seat. If you did not buy him a ticket, see if you can get an extra place on the plane. Check to make sure you can use your car seat on the aircraft (again, contact the airline) and ask nicely during check-in. They often do this for families if the flight isn't full. <br>  <br>  My children were much calmer in their familiar seats. I could also securely attach them for take-off and landing. Children under 2 are allowed in laps becuase air travel is so safe, there's little chance of anything going wrong but if it does, they are not protected. <br>  <br>  For entertainment, get him some new toys, things he hasn't seen before. They don't have to be expensive. Small plastic toy animals or anything with wheels. Does he color? Playdough and pinwheels are good for this age. Books with chunky pages and/or flaps that open work well. <br>  <br>  No toys that make ANY noise. Even quiet, he'll play it over and over..<br>  <br>  Before leaving, get him used to having socks over his hands when crawling around. You'll want to do this when he's on the plane, both to keep his hands clean and so that he doesn't pick up anything nasty off the floor. <br>  <br>  Bring slippers too, the kind that don't fall off! <br>  <br>  Try to sit in the bulkhead so you can get in and out of the seat more easily. If there is a bassinet, it's probably too small for him but try to get the seats with the wall in front anyway.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you have a good baby carrier. They're so useful for flying, especially at this age. I had a sling but other parents swear by their wraps and pouches. The Ergo and Beccos are other popular carriers for travel that go either on the front or back. They're magic for calming down babies on the plane. He's probably outgrown any front packs (like the Bjorn). All the better as they're so bad for both the adult and child's backs.<br>  <br>  Please note that it's a myth that children need to suck on something for take-off and landing. Please don't force him to drink when he doesn't want to nor wake him unnecessarily. Have his ears checked before leaving as healthy ears can handle pressurization changes. Experts recommend that the child simply be awake, not for landing but at intial descent, when the aircraft first leaves cruising altitude.

IBMDQpmRaa	The 801 area code is running out of numbers, due to growth. The last time that happened, they split Utah into two area codes moving everyone outside of the Salt Lake area into area code 435. This time rather than splitting, they're going to do what's called an overlay, and later this month they will start issuing 385-NXX-XXXX numbers in the Salt Lake area in addition to 801-NXX-XXXX. You have to dial all ten digits, since otherwise there'd be no way to tell whether you meant an 801 or a 385 number.<br>  <br>  Ten digit dialing and splits are the wave of the future, since they have the advantage that unlike with splits, nobody has to change an existing phone number when they add a new overlay area code. Lots of other places have overlays, such as New York, Chicago, Dallas, and Houston.|`|hmqmGPvbaa	i live in utah too.  its because there are to many numbers out there so they had to create a new area code, so there for you have to dial 801 to make a call like it is an original part of your number.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	This is true where I live too (Salem, Oregon) - starting a few years ago we had to start dialing the area code even to call across the street.<br>  <br>  One possible reason is that there are so many more area codes now, for smaller and smaller areas, and cell phones, that "area" codes no longer really correspond to areas anyway.<br>  <br>  Effectively everyone just has a 10-digit phone number, and the 1 you might dial at the beginning just controls whether it is long distance or not (but even the 1 at the beginning isn't really needed - you don't have to dial it on cell phones for instance).

Where have you been??<br>  <br>  Meanwhile -- while do you hate Jews so much that you'd publish this slander at us?<br>  <br>  Also, Christianity WAS hugely responsible for the Holocaust.  Hitler harnessed hate that was there already taught by the Churches.  Here are some sites with more.  Maybe you aren't familar iwth this history & if you learn more, you'll find out...in reality Jews have be shockingly forgiving for the past from Christians.  <br>  <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nizkor.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.adl.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.adl.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wiesenthal.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.wiesenthal.org</a><br>  <br>  If you'd prefer non-Jewish sources, google Pope John Paul II.  His apoloogy to the Jewish people was heartfelt & very meaningful.  It will also verify all we've said.  Also, this is an interfaith site:<br>  <a href="http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=966" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=966</a><br>  <br>  In THIS lifetime WE know people who's families were killed in pogroms -- often triggered by sermons taught in Church, especially around Easter, where after church so callled-good-Chriistians went out & killed Jews for sport.<br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with being "good Christians."  This was a theme of Christianity & if one is to be "good" one needs to look this past in the face & to safeguard from it & make changes needed (there are still plenty of changes needed -- as evidenced by the number of people who post here the false idea that "jews killed jesus" a classic bit of anti-semitism that's killed many a Jew)<br>  <br>  I sincerely hope you take time to learn more.   For the sake of understanding & peace.<br>  <br>  ======================<br>  Define "hatred at Christians?"  Maybe you are putting out classic anti-Jewishism (anti-Jewish racism) without realizing it?  Everyone does stuff like that -- but that may be why you're getting responses you don't like.  Otherwise, please give examples so we can see what you mean.<br>  <br>  As you can see from Christian posts, there has also been plenty of movement away from the past.  Also there were good Christians during the Holocaust - to learn more, the Israel Holocaust museum (Yad Vashem) has a forest of the righteous of the nations...for those who did help, often at risk or at loss of their very lives.<br>  <br>  I hope you too will start building bridges to us, & learn more about us.|`|RMMdGYCDaa	To a point, you are right.<br>  Perfect example, Look at Cher's answer. She says we dont hate them but immediately follows with a bold accusation, "Christianity WAS hugely responsible for the Holocaust."<br>  Thats the kind of thinking that comes from deep down inside.  Hatred comes from the same place.<br>  To answer you, really most all Jews do love and respect Christians and know that the Holocaust was caused by Hitler and Satan.  But here on R&S there is a group called the JPA  that really exists to be intolerant of Christians and other Jews.  That's where the hate comes from.<br>  Cher for example.|`|qEqMRTQkaa	That's not a good question.  It is like asking why the Christians hate the Jews because they crucified Christ.

I don't think it really applies to the question.<br>  Most Jews are raised on the word of God.  Most Christians aren't and won't even try to read it much less figure it out.<br>  Many Christians don't want to learn the true history of Christianity and how it melds in with the Old Testament.  Too much work.  Too hard to understand.  Yet they call themselves Christians.<br>  Just as some Jews don't want to live by the Law and their own history and change Judaism to different forms like Conservative and Reform.<br>  Too much lost freedom in Orthodoxy.<br>  There can not be a Messianic Jew until the Messiah reveals himself with his Witnesses.  You will have to read the whole thing to understand why.<br>  Anyone claiming to be a Messianic Jew is lying to you and probably themselves.  Anyone that doesn't reckonize this fact just doesn't know their bible.  They need to spend some time in study of God's word.<br>  There may well be Jewish converts.  That means they are not Jews anymore.  Not that they have accepted the Lion of Judah who hasn't shown up yet.  The Lamb of God was for the Gentiles Thank you Lord.  By accepting Him you no longer are Jewish but Christian.<br>  I think some people or more interested in appearances than the truth so make claims that aren't biblical.  Even Christians should be against that movement .  I sure don't blame the Jew for calling out false prophets.<br>  All the negativity against the Jewish religion based on Christian so called beliefs come from people that don't know their bible.<br>  Those that do never say the Jews killed Christ.<br>  I have never heard a Jew claim they did either.<br>  Jesus didn't die from the Roman crucifixion that usually lasted for days to weeks. Unless they were helped along.  It was long and slow.<br>  They would break legs to hurry things along.  Inhibit breathing.<br>  Jesus lasted 3.5 hours.  True to prophesy no bones were broken.  He gave up the ghost and died at the time he chose to.  On his own violition.<br>  I have seen this in badly wounded soldiers.  They just let go.  Not a Godly phenom.

I have not met a Jew who hates Christians and I have taught more than ten thousand young Jews over  the past 44 years. You seem to be obsessed with hatred and negative energy. You must learn to love. Hatred and prejudice become self-consuming. Of course, The Church should have done more to save the lives of Jews in WWII, but that does not mean that hatred is a mature response to the failure to act morally on the part of The Pope or his Cardinals, Monsegniors, Priests, etc. By the way, there were dozens of Christians who helped Jews from 1923 through 1948 (the more formal re-establishment of Jerusalem as the 3,300 year old capitol of The Jewish People), many of those Catholic. Frank Sinatra, a good and moral Catholic performed many,many acts - some of them not quite legal - in order to help in 1947 and 1948. Please reign in your bad feelings and bad words.

lcj1AKt1aa	All Caribbean men are not the same. Yes, you might definitely find one with the traits that you mentioned like controlling, that men make the rules and that the women have to obey.  Then again you might find some with an opposing point of view. <br>  <br>  Men all over the world cheat not only Caribbean men.  Some people always paint a picture of Caribbean men as cheaters. They have some good Caribbean men that would not cheat. Some people that have been hurt will say that or people that do not have any experience having a man will judge.  It is wrong to cheat on your partner but sometimes it happens, not because you want to do it but you might find yourself in a situation when it will happen. Years ago they uses to say that there is a man for every 5 women in Barbados.<br>  <br>  It is up to you the trust your partner because if you can't trust him it is because you can't trust yourself. For the mere fact that he wants to marry you shows that he loves you.

7aWUHDVPaa	Good luck... it's exceptionally difficult to get a complete, unbiased, and factual representation of SA history in a timeline form. But this one is decent: <a href="http://www.longwharf.org/off_homeTime.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.longwharf.org/off_homeTime.ht...</a><br>  <br>  However, a few things to be aware of as you read the timeline: <br>  <br>  - In 1833, the British empire instituted the "Slavery Abolition Act" which abolished slavery with the VERY NOTABLE exception of "territories in possesion of the East India Company." South Africa was such a territory (one in possession of the East India Company) while it was under Dutch rule. I don't know the details of this act so I'm not sure who was and who wasn't allowed to own slaves in the British Cape Colony after 1833. Point is, don't be fooled into thinking British imperialists were a benign presence. Exploiting natives was probably part of the Boere's motivation for fleeing the Cape, but independence was also likely a major driving force. If you read documents from that era you will find both a discussion resistance to "gelykstelling" (which is a resistance to the British version of racism where "Boere" and natives are at the bottom and British are at the top... in the "Boere" version they're naturally at the top) and a discussion of the importance independence and such.<br>  <br>  - In 1902 the Boere war ended (but skirmishes kept going on) and the Union of South Africa was established.  Britain's actions in that war were atrocious and it wanted to win the support of their enemies (who they now had to rule) so they appointed a Boer, someone from the same group of people as those that they faught against them in the Boere War to lead their Union Party. He however was pro-Britain in many ways. In name and in a legal sense, yes, South Africa was controlled by both British and Boere, but in reality it was more controlled by British interests until the start of apartheid and the election of the Nationalist Party. The Pass Laws were enacted with the approval of the British government. In other countries with great racial diversity, similar racist laws were enacted. And in the 19th century in regions which were undeniably a British colony, similar racist Pass Laws were enacted,<br>  <br>  Also, you can find much more information at <a href="http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/history.htm." rel="nofollow">http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/history.h...</a> <br>  <br>  Hope that helps. Good luck.<br>  <br>  **** Oh, and I realize there are only two or three mentions of anti-apartheid actions in the timeline I gave, but those were the major players: Nelson Mandela and the ANC and the martyr Steve Biko. You might also look into Walter Sisulu and the black consciousness movement. But, all the anti-apartheid type timelines are biased. Look at this one:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avoiceonline.org/aam/timeline.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avoiceonline.org/aam/timeline...</a><br>  <br>  WAY too much emphasis on US involvement. It doesn't even mention Biko or the black consciousness movement. Here you can get a timeline more specifically about black consciousness:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/special-chrono/governance/black-consciousness.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chrono...</a><br>  <br>  The SA website is definitely the most informative source, I think. But even there you will occasionally find bias. <br>  <br>  Desmond Tutu was honored because he advocated peaceful protest as opposed to violence... you will probably want to learn more about him as well. And of course, you'll want to talk about Mohandas Ghandi. Many others could be mentioned: Nadine Gordimer, Breyten Breytenbach and "die sestigers," Ruth First, Helen Suzman, Lembede, Oliver Tambo, and so forth. There's understandably a lot of anger and resentment. But ignoring the tone of the language used and looking at the facts seems to often clear things up a little.

vITZgKthaa	Boeing 787 Dreamliner <br>  is a mid-sized, wide-body, twin-engine jet airliner currently under development by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It will carry between 210 and 330 passengers depending on variant and seating configuration. Boeing stated that it will be more fuel-efficient than earlier Boeing airliners and will be the first major airliner to use composite materials for most of its construction<br>  <br>  Boeing featured its first 787 in a rollout ceremony on July 8, 2007, at its Everett assembly factory, by which time it had become the fastest-selling wide body airliner in history with nearly 600 orders.[5] Originally scheduled to enter service in May 2008, production has been delayed and it is currently scheduled to enter into service in Q1 2010<br>  <br>  So until 2010 <br>  <br>  <br>  i got it from wikipedia<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boeing_787_Roll-out.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boeing...</a>|`|d09cee80104d5ef69cfd0fb4432987c7aa	I'll tell you my favorite and my reasons at the end.  But first, let me tell you some things about each model and their commercial variants (many models and sub-models have other military variants as well), and perhaps one will shine out to you over the others.<br>  <br>  Boeing 707: this was Boeing's first commercial jetliner, and, along with its competition (the DeHavilland Comet), revolutionized the travel industry and signaled the beginning of the end for piston-powered aircraft.  It is a single-aisle aircraft powered by four Pratt & Whitney JT3C/D engines (with several exceptions).  It was produced from 1958-1979.<br>  <br>  Boeing 717: before being purchased by Boeing, McDonnell Douglas originally designed and advertised this aircraft as the MD-95.  Fundamentally based on the Douglas DC-9/MD-80 design, Boeing renamed the aircraft with the 717-200 designation.  It is a 100-seat, single-aisle aircraft with two engines attached to the fuselage adjacent to the tail (one on each side), behind the passenger cabin.  It was produced from 1998-2006.<br>  <br>  Boeing 727: another narrowbody, this trijet (featuring 3 Pratt & Whitney JT8D engines, with 1 on each side of the tail and the third integrated into the tail) was one of the most successful commercial aircraft of all time, only to be surpassed by the 737.  Able to hold up to 189 passengers, it was produced from 1963-1984.<br>  <br>  Boeing 737: this narrowbody aircraft features two engines, one attached to the underside of each wing.  Production began in 1967 for this aircraft, and continues to this day.  However, this aircraft has been produced in many versions, and is commonly organized in three generalized categories.  The original 737-200 series (a stretch of the unsuccessful -100) featured two P&W JT8D engines and has a number of variations, making it very versatile.  The "737 Classic" series (-300/-400/-500) featured CFM International CFM56 engines, which were quieter and more fuel-efficient than the JT8Ds, and was produced from 1981 to 2000.  In 1991, when the Airbus A320 began to pose a greater threat to the Classics, the development of the 737 Next Generation (NG) began; the NGs include the -600, -700, BBJ1 (Boeing Business Jet), -700ER, -800, BBJ2, -900, -900ER, and BBJ3 series, and entered production (with the -700) in 1996 and remains in production to this day.  Seating ranges for the entire family from 104 to 215 seats.<br>  <br>  Boeing 747: also known as the Jumbo Jet and the Queen of the Skies, the 747 has four engines (2 on each wing), and can be discerned by its unique "hump".  This aircraft was the first widebody to ever be produced; with two aisles and even a partial upper level, it can carry over 500 passengers.  It began production in 1969; the most recent passenger version, the -400 and -400ER, stopped being produced in 2005 (the freighter is still produced today), and the 747-8 series is still in development.<br>  <br>  Boeing 757: developed from the 767, this narrowbody jet is powered by a pair of either Rolls Royce RB211 or Pratt & Whitney PW2040-family turbofans, one under each wing.  Produced from 1982-2004, the 757 was available in the -200 and -300 series; the family could carry anywhere from around 180 passengers to nearly 280 (in the -300 series).  This aircraft is very popular as it is generally fuel-efficient, very powerful, can operate from a wide variety of airports and conditions even with a full load, and has a very high range.<br>  <br>  Boeing 767: this widebody aircraft features two engines, one under each wing.  Over time, this aircraft was available in the -200, -200ER, -300, -300ER, and -400ER series.  The 767 can carry anywhere from 181 to 375 passengers; production began in 1982; today, only the ER variants and a -300F freighter are produced.  It is popular amongst airlines as it is very versatile and efficient, as well as amongst passengers with its unique 2-3-2 seating arrangement (the most common).<br>  <br>  Boeing 777: this widebody is the world's largest twinjet.  The "Triple Seven" can carry anywhere from around 280 to well over 450 passengers (most airlines use a 3-3-3 or 2-5-2 seating configuration).  Production began in 2003 with the -200 variant.  Since then, it has been available in the -200, -200ER, -200LR (note: this aircraft can fly further than any other aircraft commercially available in the world), -300, and -300ER series.<br>  <br>  Whew!  Now that we've gotten through all of that, I'll happily tell you that my favorite aircraft is the Boeing 757-200.  If you want me to be super specific, it's with PW2037 powerplants and four overwing exits (rather than two emergency exit doors behind the wing).  Basically a -232 (Google "Boeing 757-232" and you'll see what I mean).

yULnOJUwaa	1.  How silly - people in Arizona are very friendly.  People who live here are from all over the country - very few are natives.  I've never heard of anyone trying to run people out the state!<br>  <br>  2.  Queen Creek is a suburb that is a new community - now it is pretty much like living in the country but it does have shopping centers, Starbucks, etc.  It's not outer Mongolia!  Commuting to Phoenix could be less than fun depending upon the time of day (avoid rush hour if at all possible).  The drive from Queen Creek to Phoenix could be an hour or more depending upon where you are going and what time.<br>  <br>  3.  I have a friend who lives there and has satallite.  It depends on where you live - some service will be available.  <br>  <br>  4.  Arizona is all about nature and the great outdoors.  We have amazing natural landscapes and national parks.  For young people there are the same type of things to do you'd find anywhere else.  Tempe is home to ASU and has lots of fun things for young people to do including Tempe Town Lake.  Tempe is approximately 40 min. drive from Queen Creek.  There is another fun activity that comes to mind and that is tubing down the Salt River!  Don't miss that!<br>  <br>  5.  That's silly.  No one is going to try to indoctrinate you into the Republican party.  Where do you get these ideas!  Next thing I know you'll be asking if the Indians are friendly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Generalizations are always wrong.<br>  <br>  Arizona is a beautiful state.  The summers are hot but the humidity is low so that helps.  Everything here is air conditioned so it's really not a big deal.  The winters are so beautiful and the reason so many people flock here to enjoy all that we have to offer.

fMPyLqW4aa	Well, for rides at disney world, children 7 and up can be unaccompanied on a ride. I think every child needs to have a parents guardian with them to enter.|`|LsAArkUyaa	I don't know what FL law is, but I began letting my son go off on his own within the same park we were in at age 12. This was with setting up meeting times about an hr apart and both of us having walkie talkies.
AA11496012	Ticket prices go up pretty much everywhere when you fly in the summer.  That is when the children are out of school and when families start to travel.  Depending on where you are flying, Korean Airlines and China Airlines tend to have lower ticket prices than Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific.  You can also see if there are any Asian travel agencies which can get you a good deal.  They buy tickets in bulk and are able to pass those savings along to you.|`|vITZgKthaa	<a href="http://www.expedia.com/daily/home/?semcid=13172-1_b&kword=expedia!p" rel="nofollow">http://www.expedia.com/daily/home/?semci...</a><br>  <br>  is an Internet-based travel agency<br>  travelocity- <br>  <a href="http://www.travelocity.com/?WA1=01010&WA2=GL&WA3=travelocity&WA4=E&WA5=BT&WA8=27752429_69.107.5.158%3A1236297158950" rel="nofollow">http://www.travelocity.com/?WA1=01010&WA...</a><br>  <br>  i would also recommend Northwest Airlines -check for promotions <br>  <a href="http://www.nwa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nwa.com/</a><br>  it has over <br>  all this destinations in Asia<br>  <br>  East Asia<br>  People's Republic of China <br>  Beijing (Beijing Capital International Airport) <br>  Hong Kong (Hong Kong International Airport) <br>  Shanghai (Shanghai Pudong International Airport) <br>  Japan <br>  Nagoya (Chūbu Centrair International Airport) <br>  Osaka (Kansai International Airport) <br>  Tokyo (Narita International Airport) Hub <br>  South Korea <br>  Busan (Gimhae International Airport) <br>  Seoul (Incheon International Airport) <br>  Republic of China <br>  Taipei (Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport) <br>  <br>   South Asia<br>  India <br>  Mumbai (Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport) [ends June 2] <br>  <br>   Southeast Asia<br>  Philippines <br>  Manila (Ninoy Aquino International Airport) <br>  Singapore <br>  Singapore (Singapore Changi Airport) <br>  Thailand <br>  Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi Airport) <br>  Vietnam <br>  Ho Chi Minh City (Tan Son Nhat International Airport) [begins June 1]

Also, you could go to the gas station there (I think it's Esso) they wouldhave them.  <br>  <br>  If you're closer to Flemingdon mall - there's a tuck shop I think the name is Gerry's (it's been a while sorry) and they sell tickets.|`|5afeq4NHaa	Try local variety stores. Mac's also sells them for sure.|`|yqVojuXVaa	Some corner stores carry them, or try 7-11.|`|gtDvPyLKaa	Metro, Loblaws and other stores sell ttc tickets
