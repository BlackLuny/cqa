FHCHS is like a tech school and while BCU is a real university. If i go to FHCHS i would like to become a DMS (diagnostic medical sonographer) aka Ultrasound Technician. If i go to BCU i dont know what i would want to do really, I might become a counselor or a registered nurse. Either of those to will do. FHCHS is like an uptight school and i know if i go there ill be working and working. but BCU is more fun and laid back. kind of like a party college *but being the type of person i am, i WILL get my work done and accomplish being a nurse or a counselor*. All my life i've been cooped up in this country town i live in and i've never really had any fun. Thats why i want to go off to college to have fun BUT its also to accomplish something and to get my life started. My mother says college is supposed to be fun and i'm supposed to find myself. I've never had a good Highschool life either. I graduate this year as a senior in may. I've applied to FHCHS and i'm going to apply to BCU as well. I haven't recieved an acceptance letter from FHCHS yet, but i'm confident that i will get in. So lol      my question to you is.....Should i go to BCU, the laid back fun college where i'm not EXACTLY sure what i would like to become, or FHCHS, the strict rule abided college where i KNOW i what i will become?      oh yea, FHCHS is in Orlando, FL and BCU is in Daytona, FL. both very fun places to live.

With the economy in the shape it is in, and many parents unable to help their children as much as before, how can the Universities justify continuously raising the rates of tuition? I understand state funding has dropped a percent or two over the decade but does that justify a near doubling of tuition? How about not building 2 new billion dollar biomedical complexes in order to keep tuition at an affordable rate? Seems like every time I turn around a new parking lot for administration and professors are popping up. But let the poor student pay the bill?      I mean, this is a PUBLIC University, not a private one. I look at public schools like UCLA which keep IN STATE tuition at an affordable rate but here at Michigan we get a nearly $25,000/year bill to be an undergrad along with our 20% unemployment rate.      Obviously for degrees like Engineering, teaching, business and degrees leading to Law, graduate, and Medical degrees are worth it. But if you are going to get a degree in English to be "educated" but have to take out $50 to $70K of debt is it worth it in the end if you end up making as much as you would have just out of High School as a server or in retail? Maybe you make a couple thousand more a year but you have the joy of paying back those loans?      Seems like the Universities have been able to successfully plant my generation with the idea that "you NEED a college degree" at all costs. I'm just waiting for 20 years from now to see the backlash of all the students who went through the rigorous amount of work put in for a degree that doesn't pay back the loans needed to obtain it. I'm getting to the point of telling my neighbors back at my parents neighborhood not to send their children to college unless they know they are going into a particular field because it simply isn't worth it. Yes, education is great but at some point money is a factor. And if you can't afford to pay for your child's education due to the tough times, they are better off not taking Uncle Sam's loans to get a degree that they can't use after it is all said and done.      I really feel some people are just not built for schooling required for the practical degrees (by practical I mean in today's world with rising tuition/loans and a degree to allow you to pay them back). They are better off just not enduring the debt and just working right out of high school.       So much for America educating its' children. Looks more like a scam to me as Universities are ultimately a business and they have done a wonderful job of marketing their message since we were in elementary school.       Any opinions?

During my freshman year I took a basic photography class provided by my High School that was all about learning photography and really understanding the technique involved. It was in this class that I found that I had the "eye'" for photography and therefore decided to take photography again my sophomore year. As each year progressed I not only expanded my portfolio but I was able to quickly advance to the next level and eventually complete the program all together. My experiences in photography enabled me to become the president of photography club, photography Editor of the yearbook, and participate in AP Art as well as National Art Honor Society.  Aside from all of the work I was doing in school I volunteer for an organization called Save the Forge River which works to expose our local community's river and the importance of its health. My pieces were then published online and has become the leading photographs to expose the river at its best conditions, and its worst. Last year at a benefit event I had the opportunity to work alongside Anna Wintour, which was an amazing opportunity to learn and explore my opportunities for success. Struggling to find the right major and school for my future I decided to attend some non-credit courses in the city to see what photography major has to offer. My first class was at LIM and was designed to teach the fundamentals of magazine development where I was able to incorporate my own advertisements and photographs into the design. After the course and much success advertising became an interest, which lead me to continue the program at FIT. This class that was given at FIT pushed me in the right direction as it enabled me to meet new people and work in a studio for the first time. It is now my senior year and in the past year alone I have worked in a studio setting numerous times and at each event I find how much I love photography and the lengths in which I will take to accomplish all of my aspirations.

20090222184852AAgcWCi	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Should I stay on at school or go to college?	Well im 15 ( 16 in May ) so im old enough to leave school in summer. Im from Scotland so we do Standard Grade pretty much the same as GCSE'S. Well im not to sure what to do, In the Standard Grade prelims ( i do the actual exams in may this year ) i obtained 6 credits, which is either a 1 or a 2 as most of you will know. I was pleased with the grades, which allowed me to go onto do 5 highers. I've all ready chosen my subjects if i intend to go back to school and they are 5 highers ( maths, english, physics, history and computing ). I dont see my self as a particularly smart or very smart person i just think i can get my head down and do the work.      The thing is though, i absolute dred school its not as if im badly behaved or anything it just absolutely and utterly bores the life out of me. I wake up in the morning and think oh god another day of school. This has made me ask myself as to wether stay on for another year or go to college.       At the moment im edging more over towards going to college, i've all ready looked at some courses i can do, ( i want a job in IT or admin ) like just an office job. Although the only courses that are available to me are NC courses which is equivalent to standard grade general. In all the other courses you need at least 1 higher pass to be admitted into the course.       So i was thinking is maybe this a step back from getting standard grade credits to doing a standard grade general course? Or could it be 1 step back to take 2 forward.      I was thinking that if i do the NC course in college then next year i could do the higher course which is what i would be doing next year anyway if i was staying on at school, so i kinda said to myself no matter what route i choose im gonna end up at the same point next year?       On the other hand since i got mostly or all credits in the prelims that i'm capable of Higher and maybe im aiming too low? Its just the fact of another YEAR at school i doubt i will be able to cope with      Saying all this, I've only done my prelims and not the actual exams so my results at the moment are not for sure. One thing i know for sure is, im going to study and keep my head down to pass these exams and give me the best possible chance of achieving the best in my life.      So basically yeah, just need some advice on what you guys think i should do.      Thanks in advance, Andy

The one that is featured in A Walk to Remember and many of my dear friend's weddings. I cant seem to find it in my bible. & on the internet, i've found different versions. Whats the true one?Btw, I want the King James version   These are two of a few different versions i've found:   Love is patient, love is kind.   It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.   It is not rude, it is not self-seeking.   It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.   Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.   It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.   Love never fails.   2:   Love is always patient and kind; it is never jealous, love is never boastful or conceited; it is never rude or selfish; it does not take offense, and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people’s sins but delights in the truth; it is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes. Love does not come to an end.”      There are so many others that i found too!

The classes were at my state university and they were fairly difficult courses. Will they compensate for my lowish gpa?      I'm not looking to get into any top schools, just some fairly competitive ones.      PS, I took 7 college courses.      They won't affect my hs gpa. I'm just wondering if having taken them will be impressive enough to compensate for my hs gpa.      My rank is still in the top 5% because of my weighted classes, if that makes any difference.

20090222205017AAyk9ql	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	My mum says I won't be able to get a good job if I go back to college and graduate at 26?Any thoughts?	THANKS FOR SPENDING A FEW MINUTES TO READ MY QUESTION. I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP AND APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE **********      I am 23, male. I have been studied science in an Australian university for 1 year. My parents want me to be a biological scientist but I am not interested in science at all. I didn't do well and finaIly I droped out from the course :( . My university counsellor suggest me to go back to Hong Kong (my hometown) and discover my own interest before I go back to study in Australia. Back in Hong Kong, I am living with my parents and I share the rent with them. The rent is about US$ 900 per month. Dad, mum and I pay US$300 each. My 20-year-old younger sister lives with us as well.However, she doen't pay anything.      Recently all my family members suspect I am gay. They ask , " I'm sure that you drop out from your science course because you are homosexual. Ewww! Everyday they say unplesant things to me ( e.g. I hate you so much, I'll never forgive you, You should turn back to heterosexual, I wanna beat you up because you are gay, All gay men are worse than sh*t, including you ) I face their bad words everyday in addition to having an academic failure, I went back to my room and closed the door and cried. Then sister say I am not allowed to close my room's door. " You need to have your room door opened all the time, including when you are crying. What's the point of closing the d*mn door? Have you ever considered my feelings?You know what? I have been tolerated your gayness for a while!" My parents are always on her side. They say" Listen to *your sister, you f*ggot" My parents also say " Why can't you get along with us well? If you can't get along with us well, it means you can't get along with your schoolmates and colleagues as well. You are a big loser !" My sister, who is studying to be a counsellor, says " Why are you so defensive about yourself? Why don't you loosen up yourself and date women?   " I replied "I have tried to date a girl for 3 months. But finally I've found that it doesn't work. I don't want to cheat the girl and say "I am straight" anymore. I don't want to hurt the girl. We broke up. " I added " I am proud of being gay". My sister replied , " You're so defensive about your homosexuality therefore no counsellor on Earth can help you. "       I also said , " I dropped out from science course because I have no interest in it at all. Mum, My dream is to be an successful accountant, not a scientist ."      Question 1) Which one do you think is better? Get my accounting degree in Australia or worjk in Hong Kong ? You are 23 year old laready. My mum said " If you study full-time in Australia for 3 more years , it mean you will lose 3 years of work experience. When you graduate with an accounting degree at the age of 26, no one will hire you again because you are too old at that time. And you don't have much full-time job experience . You will not able to find a good job because employers tend to employ younger people. However, I really wanna go to Australia , do my favourite course and stay away my parents. Will I be less competitive in the job market after 3 years ( because my graduate age is 26 , which is older than an average graduate ) ?

My 9th and 10th grade year of high school have basically been hell for me. This year school has been better, my grades have improved, and I became more social(I lost most of my close friends last year). I'm even taking a class at a community college so I can finish school early.But my parents don't think I'm mature and ready for college. Their playing the devils advocate and challenging me, telling me what would happen if I don't like college, and I get miserable there, and I don't get along with my roommate, or I can't handle the classes and work load. Is college really this bad or do my parents just don't know what their talking about? (My mom went to a community college, and my dad dropped out of college the end of his first year.

20090222194119AAA6Wxu	Education & Reference;Teaching	Please give me constructive criticism on my essay?	Why aren’t people able to be contented and stop looking for change?      Fifty years ago, no one could have imagined what a computer would look like, much less have predicted that an intangible tool known as the “Internet” would magnetize us.  Fifty years later, comparing our new innovations and past innovations, one can say that we are at the pinnacle of technological achievement; however, that will never be the case.  This is solely dependent on the fact that our desires and demands for change have no limits, which is why people will constantly be trying to satisfy them.   People will constantly be trying to satisfy our desires and demands for change, because it is human nature to always want more and more.  There is just no limit.     In the book Utopia, Sir Thomas Moore expresses his idea of the perfect paradise.  The people of Utopia are able to live in harmony because they all abide by a unified system of law, however, their desires and ambitions are quenched.  Looking at our modern day world, is it possible for people to undermine desires when asked to?  The answer, without doubt, is no.  Today, we know that perfection is unattainable, so instead, we strive for change and improvement.  Compelled by desires, people are unceasingly demanding change and improvement.  There is no limit to what we do desire, therefore, there is no end to change and improvement.  The Apple Incorporation and its products were known to few consumers several years ago.  Now, it is a dominant competitor in the versatile consumer electronics industry, and is a rival against the more conventional Microsoft Company.  This is because people wanted to see change (which Apple products were able to bring forward with a more modern style and appearance), but more importantly, people wanted to be introduced to new things, ideas and concepts.  People want the world to continue evolving, not maintain the status quo.    Reaching one star doesn’t seem to satisfy us; it only propels us to go further and reach another one.  If people want to keep up with the fad, then the fad needs to be constantly renewed; but even then, there is no way to completely appease peoples’ demands, because we will always be ravenous.            Thanks.

20090222194119AA8JmC8	Education & Reference;Homework Help	What do you think of this story?	The FYI with the FBI Tree      " Get up Get Up" yelled one FBI officer to another. "Don't leave me standing here alone," a light but crying voice kept on yelling, with guns firing from the other side of the room. Hiding next to a car with the opposite side of the gun firing, I saw my right leg was bleeding. My blood on Pvt. Miller's hands; he was trying to take out the bullet. I felt like going to sleep just for a minute until i saw Jane's face...       39 Hours Before all of That(November 21, 2010)       "Morning Jordan, how are you today?" said Jane. Jane was a fellow FBI worker teamed up with Jordan, even if the only reason why they are friends is because Jordan has loved Jane since the third grade. They knew each other for a long time, Jane had long brunette hair with ruby red lips. She was a hard working girl."I'm felling good today but a little sleepy from the last mission we had to do," Jordan replied. Jordan was a normal FBI worker just like Jane. He never admitted that he loved Jane and he did not know if Jane liked him. Even if they were 23 years old, their flirty thing that thay have going on still led to teasing when you like someone in secound grade and the kids are like"You like someone, you like someone, you like someone." So he just kept to the DL(down low) after Jordan and Jane got their mission to do. Their boss was Khyrel Miller-but people just call him Pvt. Miller because he worked for the Air force for 5 full years. He said that he wanted to join us in the mission but we never asked why. This mission was about a clan(gang) selling drugs and making millions by putting them in trucks and going to the Mexican border. Jordan and Jane never had something like this but the frist time with Pvt. Miller may be easy... Or will it...      Chapter 2(The clan's upper Hand)       The next moring Jordan,Jane, and Pvt.Miller were heading to the clan were the clan of drugs dealers were seen. On the way there Pvt. Miller was getting a little Jumpy about it. He kept telling us to keep our heads down when there was firing going on, and that there might be more FBI agents around then just us. He was acting like these wre the most deadly people. After the talk with Pvt. Miller, there were 10 FBI Cars already there, plus 8 police cars and 5 S.W.A.T cars, with all of them armed. All of those cars and people were surrounding the bulding were the clan was. But they were with hostages and they were all on floor 6. Jordan and Jane did not know what they were getting themselves into, but according to Pvt. Miller's face, it did not look good. Even if we had more people than them, They claim to have a  bomb hidden on each floor. If we go inside those two big doors or the top of the bulding... BOOM. We all might not survie, for the people who went in.      Chapter 3(Now what?)        With the clan having the upper hand by having bombs, plus being armed, having hostages, and by having a higer land than us meaning better vantage point, the only thing that Jordan can say is "Now What?" The people of the publix were 100 yards away from the bulding. And The only Thing we can do is drill a hole by going under the sewer lines to put a time bomb that can make a hole big enought to fit our troops(FBI,police, and S.W.A.T). Even though we have to go in the smelly,stinky, sewer lines dripping with dirty water from the ceiling... It is necessary to fool the clan; The last thing that the clan will be thinking is us going under the buldin. After 15 mintues later we did what was planned and tip-toed to the frist floor, to the secound floor, to the thrid floor, all the way to the sixth floor. They slammed the door down and yelled "FREEZ" but know one was there. Except the hostages in a little corner saying not to come near them?.?                                          Chapter 4(keep your head down)        After a few hours we had a plan to deal with this problem. We saw that there was a rope tied to thier necks and that we couldn't cut it because it was attached to a motion bomb. If the bomb touches the floor, or even a little feather touches it or it jiggles just a little, it will go off."OH my goodness! how many diffent bombs do they have?" Jane said. Even though they had a plan to fix this, they were scared it wouldn't work. SO they had to think of something else before it's to late. The clan is on the 7th floor and we could not just let them stay there forever. Pvt. Millier said "Group 43& 44 stay here and find out how to get those hostages out. Group 40& 39& 38 come to the 7th floor and keep your head down when you get there!" Jane and Jordan were in group 39 and this would be there frist shootout if the clan decides to fire. After the new plan was in motion, Jordan was always following Jane; not because he was scared but because he did not want her to get hurt. It was realy cute how he was trying to protect her from stuff that was not even dangerous like,"look out for that bump," or "becareful of your head," for example. When the FBI saw the

My GPA is currently a 2.9, although I'm maintaining a 4.0 right now, but it's my last semester so it won't be shown to them until after I'm accepted, I guess :-(, but I've always taken the hardest classes my school offers. I'll be taking an AP exam in May.      SAT score was a cumulative 2230      800/800 on Reading   720/800 on Writing   710/800 on Math      Extracurriculars include music, knowledge bowl, and international club.      Volunteer service includes about 30 hours of Hospital, Library, Red Cross and Food Drives.      What do you think? How will the GPA affect me? The wait is killing me.

20090222205411AAPgb2U	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How good of a college could I get into?	I'm getting a 4.1 weighted gpa, about a 3.7 unweighted. As a junior I'm taking AP chemistry in addition to physics honors, and the rest of my classes are all honors (with the exception of gym and my elective, of course. As a senior I plan to take AP biology, AP calculous, and AP physics along with humanities honors and forensics.      As far as SAT's go I haven't taken them yet but I scored a 186 on my PSAT's (out of 240) which put me in the 91st percentile. I'm taking another SAT prep course which should boost my score.      I'm in my school's stage crew, I'm a bass drummer on the exhibition line in a champion-level drum corps, and I'm expecting to get eagle scout by my 18th birthday.      My major is going to be biochemistry or biotechnologies. My ultimate goal is to do research in prosthetic limbs, things like synthetic muscles or improving the controlling of the limbs.       Speakers in my school about going to college have all been somewhat helpful, but nothing my school provides really helps in figuring out what kind of college I can go to. So, given how I've been doing academically, what level school should I be looking at? poor, bellow average, average, above average, great, top 10(For the sake of a scale, I know I probably can't get into schools that good.)? Is there a place I can go to find college rankings or some kind of description of how the average student at a given college did in high school? anything to help me find out how good of a college I can safely look into.

Up until now, I was a 4.0 student, but now Chemistry has brought me down. I pay attention in class, take all my notes, study them, and try to understand what's going on. I even chose to sit directly in front of the teacher so I could possibly pick some things up along the way.      But I just don't understand it! I think I know it, but when I take a test I am completely lost. I get a test back and I either failed, or I got a low 70.

I want to be able to... study more often and actually try doing homework. But, I pretty much have no one to push me around when I get home and even when I try to do my homework, I just give up right away.   My friends kind of help me out, but rarely. Most of my friends have after-school, or tutoring, or some kind of activity to do. I mean, yes. I want an after-school program or tutor, but I DON'T want to waste my mom's money since we're already in a tight spot now.   I mean, sure. I can go to my school and get mandated, but then it would be all junked up.   For example: Math - Monday, English - Tuesday, Social Studies - Wednesday, Spanish - Thursday. Science - ???   They don't give out lessons on Friday, plus my science teacher does do much! So, I'm in a really tight spot.   All I want is to study and do my homework. So, can you help me out?   Like, what can I do to prevent me from doing my homework (I have a very small attention span, which makes my friends very angry)?   I have "a lot" of game consoles (according to my friends) and I can play them whenever I want to! How can I prevent myself from playing them? And, my house is messy at the moment, so it hard to find all my text books... so I'd probably think something like "Hmm... my house is messy. I SHOULD CLEAN IT" then 10 minutes later, I'd say "I'm bored. I'll take a break from cleaning and USE THE COMPUTER" Then that break turns into hours and then my mom's home.   Please! HELP ME.

Hi, I am a junior in an upper-class competitive suburban high school. My GPA is ~3.4 now, and will get higher for sure when I finish my 1st semester senior year (only 2 AP's now. 4 next year).  I have not taken the ACT yet but got a 31 on a practice test and am taking prep classes for it.      I came to the United States from Afghanistan in 1996. I had a part-time job last summer and volunteered at a hospital. This summer I will have a job again and volunteer at the same hospital and at a nursing home. I am part of Habitat For Humanity, Latin Club, and track.      After my undergrad I will apply to medical school and want to major in biochemistry, biology, or neuroscience (which not many colleges offer unfortunately...). The ones that I am looking at now are Loyola Chicago, UIC, and University of Illinois. My number one pick is Northwestern, but I am doubtful of my chances there.      What are my chances at these colleges? Are there other ones I should look at?      Thanks

20070515043943AAlFbPJ	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Qual é a sua opini?o sobre as Escolas de S?o Paulo arredondar as notas para cima?	S?o Paulo - Um novo sistema de avalia??o para todos os alunos da rede pública estadual entrou em vigor na sexta-feira, com a publica??o de uma resolu??o no "Diário Oficial". Todas as escolas v?o adotar um mesmo padr?o de médias bimestrais, com notas em números inteiros de 0 a 10 - valores decimais devem ser arredondados para mais. Assim, um aluno que obtiver nota 4,2 na média anual terá sua nota arredondada para cima e será aprovado com 5.      A medida é o primeiro passo para a mudan?a na avalia??o da progress?o continuada, cuja avalia??o passa a ser a cada dois anos, e n?o quatro, como ocorre hoje. Já neste ano os alunos da 2a série do ensino fundamental ser?o avaliados e, em 2008, o mesmo ocorrerá com os estudantes da 6a série.      A resolu??o publicada prevê que deve haver o "arredondamento para o número inteiro imediatamente superior" na nota bimestral, mas a secretária de Educa??o do Estado, Maria Lúcia Vasconcelos, n?o acredita que isso possa beneficiar o aluno "pregui?oso". "Isso acaba sendo até um estímulo. A diferen?a n?o está em meio ponto. O importante é o aluno saber o que se espera dele", afirma. A mudan?a também foi necessária para que os alunos possam ter acesso aos seus boletins também pela internet, a partir de agosto. As informa??es s?o de O Estado de S.Paulo.
