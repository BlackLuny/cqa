20090203121055AAK2iOq	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Is justice in the UK so unbelievably stupid today? (read detail)?	Ok there were two court cases last year in the court near my home town.      Ok, case 1   3 black men, raped a young woman. They filmed themselves painfully and sexually abusing her. And they sold tapes of it to other people,   they get a sentence of 9 years in jail. Bare in mind these black men have had a history of violence.      Ok case 2,   a young man, around age 20, he got glowing references from all of his teachers and past job employers, saying he was never late, he was bright and hard working, they said he was a top class citizen.   He has had no past occurrences with the law.   Ok, he took 1 Ecstasy pill, which he regretted taking. He had 3 of the pills on him, and one was picked up by someone in a bar who took it of his own accord.   The man said he realised his mistake and asked for a custodial sentence in a drug rehabilitation facility.   The judge denied him that opportunity and gave him an 10 year sentence!      So if someone takes a Ecstasy pill, it deserves more severe punishment than when 3 black men violently rape a young girl and sell the tapes?   wtf is this place coming to.   I mean, yeah, that young man was stupid to take the drug, but he didn't deserve 10 years, he should have been given a year in rehab or something at the most.

From About.com: Presidents who died in office:      In 1900, William McKinley was elected to his second term as president. Once again, he defeated his opponent, William Jennings Bryan as he had in 1896. On September 6, 1901, McKinley was shot by Leon F. Czolgosz. McKinley died on September 14th. Czolgosz called himself an anarchist and admitted to killing the president because, "...he was the enemy of the people...." He was electrocuted in October, 1901.      Crime to execution: Not more than 42 days! Something is missing from the way we do things today!

20090221014111AAnghMr	News & Events;Current Events	Obama's Black Uprising?	There are a lot of people that believe that Obama's election is proof of improving race relations in this country, but I've been seeing some disturbing signs that it could actually be indicative of things getting worse. There have been people saying that blacks have a new arrogant attitude ever since Obama won, as if a half-black president now gives them an excuse to do whatever they want. I personally didn't see it myself until a few days ago when I was riding the Caltrain.      I was sitting across from this big unruly looking black guy who was taking up two seats on the train; One for himself, and one for his bag. This white couple came in and the white guy was moving the bag to make room for his girlfriend, and the black guy waves his arms and starts yelling, "Fuk you, don’t you be touchin my shet. I is here first." The lady calmly tried to explain that she had paid for a ride and deserved a seat, and there was a pause as the black man looked like he was about to explode, and than he shouted, "400 years of slavery is over. You can't tell me what do no more." The couple than left because it looked like the black guy was going to get violent soon.      A little while after this happened I've almost nodded off, but I'm awoken by a ruckus and I look over to see the black guy's bag has spilled a bunch of empty cans on the floor. An older white woman asks him to clean up the mess, but of course he refuses and replies to her, "shove it up yo ***." She looks offended and asks him again, and he gets up and yells, "Shove it up yo muvafuka's ***."      This is where it gets interesting. He than looks around the cabin and screams to everyone, "400 years of slavery is over. It's time fo change. It's time fo niggas to rise up and take charge." The old woman admonished him then, saying that black people are falling, not rising, if this behavior keeps up.      Needless to say, this is just a single experience, though it does seem to hint at a possible pattern. My question to the forum is two-fold. Have you seen signs of black people being uncivil and acting entitled, even more so than usual? And if this is a new trend, shouldn't white people do something pre-emptively to stop it from getting out of hand?

I currently have a home that I cannot afford but I am current on payments and have a credit score of 733. I have not been late on a payment for anything in years.      My ex wife and I purchased this home in 2006 for $163,000. I make $50,000 and she makes roughly $35,000. We had no trouble making our payments. We divorced in 2008. She let me keep the house since she knew she couldn't afford it and didn't want to ruin her credit.       I cannot afford this house, the payment is $1450 a month. My net pay is only $1,000 every other friday due to deductions such as child support, insurance, 401,,,,ect. Seven months ago my savings account had nearly $10,000 in it, today its at $4,000.       This house was purchased for $163,000 Columbus Ohio, I owe $158,000...and its probably only worth around $120,000.      So my question is: What should I do? Should I continue draing my savings account just to stay current? I am doing everything I can to not fall behind. After the savings acct is gone, my next option is tapping my 401k. Im only 29 years old and I don't know if this worth me draing everything I have or to just let the house go and start over?       I plan to talk to professional bankers before making any decision but I am curious to what you all think and any advise that you may have. I have heard that you will not qualify for the 1/3 of income payment if your current and not showing hardship...should I fall behind on purpose?      Thank you for your advise

There hasn't been a topic that has come up that really catches my eye, or that i  am passionate about.      I want to write my paper based upon a quote or saying.   Maybe about love, or life, or maybe even death...Any ideas?       Thank you.

This whole thing is really pissing me off these poor babies are suffering all because of her selfishness, her focus should be on their care right now in the NICU, not trying to bargain with the media for $2M. Do you think she is going to end up with a show like she wants? There is no good way to end this situation but take some of those kids away from her!

I live in the 2nd floor of some flats, and when im sleeping, some little runt will hold his funger on the buzzer for a good minute or so.

If I was a light sleeper I would sleep dressed withmy shoes, jump out my window, fly down the fire escape, rund round to the front of the building and unleash a mike tyson style beating. But I just dont wake up that fast.      What can I do to find out who it is/get some revenge?
