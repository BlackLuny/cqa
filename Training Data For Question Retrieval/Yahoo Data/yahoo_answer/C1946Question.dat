Only I only got in 3 channels (CBS, CW, My Network TV) with it, but no ABC, NBC, FOX or PBS. Now all my local channels have gone digital and they said they were going to increase their signals only I don’t. I got ABC for 5 minuets the day they did the transition almost a week ago then it promptly went out.      I thought getting a new TV would help so I chucked the box and got a new TV, but I still just get the same 3 channels. I thought getting an outside antenna would, but the same thing.      I’m a big movie buff and I can’t miss the Oscar Sunday. I’ve watched them every year in their entirety since 1993 and any help would be much appreciated!

Now, 5-6 hours later, it's so weak!! I had to remove an insert between the battery and the metal contact, so it's not as if it's been draining for ages. WTF? Is it because the batteries are Chinese because they have some Chinese characters on them? I mean because manufacturing standards in China are lower right?

Ok I got my PS3 to work on HDMI and when it was connected to the t.v. the sound had some static, because my speakers aren't the best.  SO I bought an Insignia NS- RS101 receiver. Now the picture looks great on HDMI but there is no sound.  I got it going through the digital optical part which is perfect.  But whats the point of having one wire if it isn't working correctly.  The only way I hear the sound is if its going through the auxilary channel on the receiver but still sounds staticy.  Any thoughts?  Oh and yes I did switch the sound options on the XMB cross bar on the PS3.  SO Basically in short, Video 1 HDMI has picture but no sound.

20090203083347AAzP2Vk	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Swapping xbox 360 dvd drive?	Alrighty, my xbox is broke. When I put a disc whether it be dvd, cd, or game in the dvd drive of my xbox 360 (normal, not elite) and close the drive my xbox displays "Reading...." then after a few moments I see "Open Tray" as if there is no disc in the drive at all. The disc is spinning and my discs are not scratched. My warranty from xbox is void and so is my purchased warranty from gamestop (where I bought it from) so I am literally s.o.l. I don't have the cash to buy a new xbox but I do have enough to purchase a new dvd drive. I've snooped around online and managed to find quite a few sites that discuss the same xbox problem I am having. However, I cannot find reliable information on swapping the dvd drive. So far I saw some things mentioning each dvd drive is unique to each 360, but I do not know if it is by specific model or are each dvd drive coded via software to my xbox? Because if I just have to buy the exact same model as the one my xbox requires I'll be happy to just swap the old one out with a new one. Is that the case?      By the way, I should mention this is not a red ring of death issue and because my warranty for xbox is expired it would cost me around 100 bucks to send the xbox back for repairs and approximately a month of no xbox. The xbox still runs perfectly fine, it just cannot do anything disc related.
