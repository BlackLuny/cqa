20090219205303AAOmC5W	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	I want to learn everything about philosophy, where do I start?	I apologize for having such a vague question. I realize philosophy is to vast an idea to learn in a textbook, or over a couple nights of studying. Some people spend their whole lives trying to answer the simplest of questions. Anyways, I've always had a strong interest in philosophy, and would like to study it further. I've never taken a class in philosophy, but would really like to learn as much as my measly brain permits. I realize this is a simple question, but if I wanted to cover the whole immense spectrum of philosophy in a short period of time (lets say a year or two), what topics  or ideas should I cover to get the widest range of knowledge on this topic. Realize I'm not interested in getting to deep yet (of course knowing me it'll happen anyway). I just want to skim the surface so I'm aware of all the facets of this all-inclusive discipline. I want a list, curriculum to a class, or something like that. Any help would be nice, but only people who know about philosophy should answer. I've been to Wikipedia, so copying their "Topic outline of philosophy" isn't going to help me. Thanks for giving your time.

20090219205550AAtK1jb	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	It's a bit long, but would you read it and tell me if it's interesting at all?	I hope you can understand me not using everyone's actual name. I don't want people to figure out who I was writing about. I feel it would be a burden for them to bear. Also, it might not be in their best interest. Having said that, my name shall be changed to "Sam". This story doesn't really have a background. It's just a story. There will be no real structure, which might annoy some of you. Others, however, might find it a better style. In any case, I feel it best fits who I am, and what follows this introduction. After just a few short sentences, this story will begin and a few of you might stop reading. You may become very bored and annoyed with this. Others will find it entertaining and somewhat of a relief from whatever they are doing. I am writing this with no real goal set. Who knows, maybe someone I am writing about will read this. If that is the case... Hello there! Now that I've given you no clues or vague general idea of what this is about, let me begin. I think this should start with my freshman year in high school.      Year 1   High school. Supposedly the greatest years of your life. At least, that's what all the movies and television shows say. My freshman year in high school was somewhat average. Should I start from the very beginning? Or a random point I feel stuck with me. Some point in time that had a lasting effect on me. I think it's a bit too early to start like that. The first day was a bit hectic. I arrived at school about 10 minutes before the bell rang for class to start and didn't know where four of them where. Pretty good start, isn't it?       My first class was p.e.(gym, as some of you may call it). I had a few friends in the class, none too close though. We didn't do much of anything. Mainly sat in the gym and talked as the teacher spoke about the syllabus. Can you believe it? A syllabus for a physical education class. That has always struck me as odd. Something about signing a paper saying you will not be late to a class where the teachers themselves are, on average, ten minutes late. That wasn't the only thing on the paper, but it has always struck me as somewhat ridiculous.       Well my next class was English. Again, I had a few friends in the class, none to close though. Which was surprising because one of them has been my neighbor and had gone to the same two school, prior to high school, as I had. The same old boring syllabus instructions. A simple overview and timeline of the semester, and the rest of the year. Which is a great way to start, by the way. It lets students know how much stress they're going to be under for the rest of the year. Well, as I was starting to fall asleep, the bell rang which startled me quite a bit.        *This is where things start to get confusing. It's a bit early in the book to confuse you, and I am not doing it intentionally, but I can't remember what order the rest of my classes were in. So my next class was either Science, Math, or Drama. I say that because I'm pretty sure my geography class was last on my schedule... So while I make a few calls to find out what time each class was at, I'm going to give you random tidbits of information about me.*      My favorite colors are blue, green, purple, yellow, and black. I take interest in art, philosophy, psychology, history, drama, photography, and music. I'm about 5'10", with a bit bigger than average build. I'm stronger than most people realize, including myself. I have hazel eyes which change to be more green or more brown depending on the light. I have dark brown hair which I don't really brush or comb, but always looks like it has been. My hair goes down to just before my eyes. I'm mexican, but some people say I look middle eastern. My parents divorced when I was about five years old. My mother raised my brother and I, so I came out a bit more sensitive than other guys. My brother, on the other hand, took after my dad and fell under the influence of my cousin, which you will find out about later in this story. So by this point you should have somewhat of an idea of what I look like. Also, you should have a general idea of how I will process things.      *After approximately half an hour, I gave my friend "Sarah" a call and she helped with the order of the schedule.*      My next class *as my good friend Sarah informed me* was Science. I had a goof-ball of a teacher. The kind of teacher any kid would be lucky to have. Witty sarcasm, quick come backs and a great sense of humor. An older man of about fifty-some years of age. He always took a bottle of scope, poured a bit into his coffee mug, and seemingly, drank from it. That probably explained why he acted the way he did. He made learning easy and fun. At times, though, he would upset a few kids and be short-tempered.      After his class, I had math. The infamous Algebra 1. It gives me shivers just to think about those equations, hahaha. Maybe not so bad, if you're not at this level of math yet don't be alarmed. Sarah was in this class, as well as my ph

20090219212348AAqmXsK	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What is your opinion on this paragraphs?	Students are constantly misinformed that everything changes and nothing remains the same. Does nothing remain the same? You can never identify that which you search for if nothing remains the same. No one can ever prove that which can never be the same.        The things without which one cannot exist remain the same. The things without which one cannot exist can neither be created nor be destroyed. The things without which one cannot exist are conserved forever.         Secondly, the ideas with which one searches, identifies, questions, studies, classifies, describes, comprehends and explains all the rest remains the same. The ideas without which one cannot search, identify, question, study, classify, describe, comprehend and explain all the rest can neither be created nor be destroyed.        Everything except the order in which those which can neither be created nor be destroyed exist can never be changed.

Because fooling around, even if its work but work that you want to do and can do anytime, will make you bored and meaningless.      They need real work.

"i missed you...a lot. for some reason, you were the only one i was able to think of. not a. not b. not even the people i pledged to protect. heh. i often found myself asking if you were thinking of me, as i was about you."   i found myself looking down. i was embarrassed by what i said. i sounded like such a loser and so desperate. i was thinking about things too much and too fast again until my thoughts broke as she started talking.   "i did think of you. i thought i was just being a little girl...but now with what you've told me...i've missed you, very much, almost too much."   i went blank. all i could do now was stare through her in amazement. i found myself looking down again, but this time with a smile on my face.   "thank you", she said.   "for what?" i was looking at her again.   "for missing me."   i let out a breath of a laugh."why wouldnt i miss you?"   "why would you?"   "i love you". as i said that everything went silent. even the wind that was blowing her beautiful red hair against her face died down. her eyes seemed almost empty. it felt like time itself stopped.   "..."   i knew i had to say something. i couldn't help what i just said. i had to change this moment. i had to make something out of this. i had to recover from this mistake. i had to say something. anything!   "i hope that didn't come out too cheesy. i spent the whole trip back trying to word that right without sounding so--"   "hey..stop talking." she cut me off. i was ready for a verbal lashing. i felt terrible and sick. after all she went through, i should be aware of her feelings. it was so obvious. what was i thinking. was i thinking? these thoughts raced through my head so fact that i COULDN'T think. i attempted to stumble for words, but before i could say anything, she finished what she started saying.   "i love you too."   i felt like i went dead.

20090219211134AAeI0Pq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Why do I hear people hate on Harry Potter?	Okay, we all know that Twilight gets bashed on all the time, but that's not what I'm here to discuss. Even though lately Twilight has been getting a lot of negative feedback, when Harry Potter came out, quite a few people would bash on it and say it's a "popcorn book" that won't last the ages.      My question is, why not? Unlike Twilight, Harry Potter actually has some great writing. Rowling incorporated one of the Canterbury Tales into the last book (the tale about death and the three brothers was actually derived from it), and if you look throughout the series, it's actually a story about Harry growing up and maturing.      I know I only briefly mentioned two reasons, but honestly Rowling knew her literature, and knew how to write.      What's not to like?      -Sidenote- I'm asking this because I heard a kid talking about it at school, and felt obligated to correct him. And I'm wondering what you guys think.

Well, its only been like 7 months...but still... Months.)         This is a story many of you may have vaguely heard about, and im going to tell you all about it.            It alllll started the very first night of our Europe Trip when we were in Rome.      Everyone was having an amazing time, still in disbelief that we were actually in rome and excited for the many days to come. It was a warm night, illuminated by the Full Moon. A night that we involved will never forget.      During the day's tour we discovered this amazing ice cream that the locals called 'Gelato'.  It was very good, despite its somewhat ugly appearance. That night a few of us were getting a sweet tooth, we said 'hey, why dont we go and find some Gelato?' Everyone agreed and we were soon on our way to find a shop that sold the delicious treat.      We eagerly began our voyage; AJ, Cody, Victor, Eddie, and I walked out of the gate of the hotel and into the parking lot.      Our Trip had begun.      We walked for about 2 minutes and we came to this brightly lit porch area with vending machines.  To our surprise we found cigarettes and condoms being sold in the machines. We all laughed and we continue walking. We casually walked past this group on the other side of the street quietly talking amongst themselves.  We thought nothing of it and we continued our hunt for Gelato      We walked in silence down another street and we began to lose hope of finding our sweet treasure.  Eddie broke the silence, "Wouldn't it be funny if Mr. Tillery was trying to warn us that this place was a gangster-mafia place?" I Don't think anyone payed any attention to that comment...      As we were walking, these two guys drove passed us on a Moped, or whatever those things are called, and they yelled something at us. i wish i knew what they were saying because it would sound so much cooler for this story, but i have no clue what they said or even how it sounded. Anyways, they yelled at us and kept on driving. Victor muttered, 'fags', his comment was met with apprehensive chuckles.      We Kept Walking.      They came back around and we thought they left, but they came back and parked their bike beside us.  We ignored them and kept on walking. They ran up to us and stopped us.  They started talking to us and we were like 'uhh what?' We said that we don't understand them, which doesn’t really help but maybe they would switch languages to something one of us could understand. We told them that we didn’t understand them, and we continued walking.      They ran up ahead of us and stopped us again. We told them again, “we don’t understand what you are saying!"      So we kept walking some more.      They caught up to us again and started talking to us. We tried to communicate with them, but it wasn't working. I followed the shorter person's eyes and he was looking behind us up the street where he came from. I looked and i saw a huge group of people walking towards us. It looked like on 28 Days Later, except they were walking and not running..      But we just kept walking.       They stop us again and try talking to us again.       By this time the rest of the group is closing in on us.       We started walking away again but the group began to run ahead of us and encircle us. There were about 12 or 14 people.      We tried talking to them some more, but to no avail. Victor said "what do you want?!"   and one of the people was like 'what do you waaant?" trying to copy what victor said. It was pretty funny but we tried not to laugh. Our conversation continued and Eddie said 'Gelato?' and made a motion like he was eating ice cream with a spoon.      One of the guys was like 'ohhh Gelato?' and shook his crotch with his hand, we all busted up laughing hahaha      Another person had this rubber band string thing and he kept flicking it at cody, trying to bug him.      And another person took AJ's hat, and he was probably going to keep it or something so AJ grabbed it back from him.      I tried asking if someone knew spanish, i was asking, 'espa?ol?' to the people but no one answered so that didnt really work.      So th

20090219214445AANrlSq	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How would the history of Philosophy be different if.......?	. . . If Glaucon had asked better questions at the beginning of Book VII in The Republic?  You know, like these:      How did they eat?      If they didn't eat, how did they live longer than six months?      As they grew up through childhood, how were the manacles adjusted?      If they were being fed, wouldn't they have seen their captors (putting food into their mouths) and been able to distinguish a real person from the shadows which were passing before them?      I realize that some of these are pretty insolent questions, but Socrates would have put up with them patiently.       http://platosallegory.com/

20090219214435AAkRbUA	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	The theme of Pablo Neruda’s poem “Ode to My Socks” is...?	The theme of Pablo Neruda’s poem “Ode to My Socks”  is       A. to honor the maker of the socks.   B. to honor the precious gifts from nature.   C. to describe the many uses of socks.   D. to make the most of life.       Mara Mori brought me   a pair of socks   which she knitted herself   with her sheepherder's hands,   two socks as soft as rabbits.   I slipped my feet into them   as if they were two cases   knitted with threads of twilight and goatskin,   Violent socks,   my feet were two fish made of wool,   two long sharks   sea blue, shot through   by one golden thread,   two immense blackbirds,   two cannons,   my feet were honored in this way   by these heavenly socks.   They were so handsome for the first time   my feet seemed to me unacceptable   like two decrepit firemen,   firemen unworthy of that woven fire,   of those glowing socks.      Nevertheless, I resisted the sharp temptation   to save them somewhere as schoolboys   keep fireflies,   as learned men collect   sacred texts,   I resisted the mad impulse to put them   in a golden cage and each day give them   birdseed and pieces of pink melon.   Like explorers in the jungle   who hand over the very rare green deer   to the spit and eat it with remorse,   I stretched out my feet and pulled on   the magnificent socks and then my shoes.

I find this LOL funny, because each time I watch one of those movies where a girl is quoting Shakesphere- Oh! Where Art Thou my Romeo! Okay, when you read the story, Romeo was just in love with Rosalie, and he's in his room all day thinking the world is ending because the girl doesn't like him back. Sees Juliet, and she is prettier. Romeo does say that he doesn't want to marry, and just wants to.....Uhh. Yeah. Falls in love with her because she is pretty.   So, you want some guy who doesn't care about you, that will leave when he sees a better looking girl? Awesome.      I find this really funny, what do you guys think about it? My 9th grade teacher said that Romeo and Juliet is one of the most misunderstood stories in the history of forever.

20090219220605AAOIjyc	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	I wrote a song. What do you think? (:?	I started writing a song last night. All I have so far is 2 verses and a chorus, and I might turn the chorus into a verse. The song is called "Your Old Converse" Constructive criticism would be very much appreciated. Just keep in mind I'm only 13.      [Verse 1]   Your old converse I recall   Stole them from your closet long ago   Word down by the burden to keep hold   Faded by the sunlight, magnified burned holes   They kept me breathing air knowing we had some things we shared      [Verse 2]   Shoe laces, hewed from the stress of all   Filth smeared by an unknown cause   [Might add 2 lines here]   I never lost faith in these shoes that kept me safe      [chorus]   Your old converse, I never let them go.   Keep them at my bedside to keep me warm   Your old converse too depleted to be worn   But with their succumbing we became one      That's all so far. Just one thing I might add, the converse are completely metaphorical.      Thanks (:

I don't need an analysis or anything, just a literal meaning of what's going on. I just need a summary because I'm a little confused about what's going on!!      "Ralph shuddered. The lagoon had protected them from the Pacific: and for some reason, only Jack had gone right down to the water on the other side. Now he saw the landman's view of the swell and it seemed like the breathing off some stupendous creature. Slowly the waters sank among the rocks, revealing pink tables of granite, strange growth of coral, polyp and weed. Down, down, the waters went, whispering like the wind among the heads of the forest. There was one flat rock there, spread like a table, and the waters sucking down on the four weedy sides made them seem like cliffs. Then the sleeping levianthan breathed out, the waters rose, the weed streamed, and the water boiled over the table rock with a roar. There was no sense of the passage of waves; only this minute-long fall and rise and fall."      that's from ch. 6. particularly the last 3 sentences confuse me.      thanks!

20090219172747AAMpn9u	Arts & Humanities;History	Any hints about the Spanish Armada?	Last year, I took European History. It was fun--one of the stories that (I thought) stuck out was the story our teacher told us about the Spanish Armada. I cannot remember when it happened--but he stated the Spanish tried to attack Britian (I think), but Britian beat them and Spain was no longer a major world power.      Great.      This year, I am in American History. We are also learning about the Spanish Armada (around 1900) when, during the Spanish-American war, the U.S. apparently killed the last of the Spanish Armada.      I suppose my question is...did both things happen? When did the first Spanish Armada happen (the first one I mentioned). I am just a bit confused. I'd ask my teacher, but it really has little to do with what we are learning (we've moved on) and I'm a bit too shy for that :)   Thank you.
20090219185443AAnBwdW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How does this sound (2)?	another extract from my drafts.   plz read:      I began walking up the stone stairs towards the gates. They were rout iron, painted black in the summer, but the cold weather had created cracks, and the paint was peeling back to reveal bloody insides of rust. Flecks of white drifted down around the gates, flakes of snow that wouldn't settle, melting on the gate and on the twisted yew tree beside it. The tree bared its gnarled arms to the darkening sky, and I shivered in the cold.         I was already late. I knew that much without having to check my watch. The trains had been delayed because of the heavy snow further north, and i suppose i was lucky they were still running into the mountain towns and villages at this time of year.         I hate trains. The rocking, swaying motion makes me feel sick, and i spent most of the 4 hour journey chewing my plaits. The carriages always smell of old people, usually crowded with businessmen who cut you off at the door and pretend you don't exist, baby's who squall through the entire trip and ancient old men who fall asleep and drool on your shoulder.             this is a rough draft that will be edited at a later date. i just want advice on it so far :) so what did u think of this, honestly?

20090219184546AAZIxO9	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Is my story plot original?	my story is about a boy who escapes Death, and now Death will do anything to make sure he dies. But when the boy tells his parents, they don't believe him and he gets sent to a mental facility. But later they find that there is nothing wrong with him and he is set free. Afterward, the boy gets enrolled in a boarding school that has magical kids who have different powers and are from a different world. (Not planet. A world. Just to clarify that.) But the headmaster's daughter gets kidnapped and the boy and a lot of other students have to go save her. Yet again he encounters Death, and realizes he has powers of his own.       I wanted to know if this was an original idea, because my brother told me that my plot was a mix of two movies called "The Sixth Sense" and "Kidnapped". I have never watched these movies, and I haven't really heard of them, but is it true that this is basically a mix? No rude comments please, and I hope u can help. Thanx a ton!

Renowned author Stephen Speilberg just gave his opinion on contemporary series like Harry Potter and Twilight and they're affect on the literary world, this is a quote from the article:      "I think that I serve that purpose for some writers, and that’s a good thing. Both Rowling and Meyer, they’re speaking directly to young people. ... The real difference is that Jo Rowling is a terrific writer and Stephenie Meyer can’t write worth a darn."       So do you agree, disagree, or do not care at all...and why?        this is the link for the WHOLE article from USAWEEKEND:       http://blogs.usaweekend.com/whos_news/20...    : D
20090219194217AAG7H2z	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How could I improve my poem?	Mr Handsome      I am the handsomest of men,   the ladies look, then look again.   I'm toned and fit, and tall and dark;   in my blue eyes resides a spark   which makes them tremble deep within   and lets me turn their hearts to 'sin'.   If truth be told, I'm quite a tease,   but women's eagerness to please -   to play the game of 'birds and bees'   and do their utmost to appease   my appetite for pleasures rare -   lets me perform with style to spare.      I am Adonis come to life,   all women wish to be my wife.   I conquer hearts with languid ease   and watch them go weak at the knees.   Whenever I walk through a door,   I smile as their chins hit the floor.   E'en Sapphic slaves can't help but 'turn',   so filled with lust for me they burn,   their lady-love they all do spurn   and nevermore will they return   to their past wicked, wanton ways,   such is the power of my gaze.      My skin is firm and tanned and smooth,   my honeyed words do serve to soothe   the fever in their lustful hearts,   pierced by cherubic Cupid's darts.   I cannot fail, I am God's gift   to women who just need a lift   to make them feel desired and young   by one so handsome and well-hung,   who charms them with a silver tongue,   whose name and fame are so far-flung -   for me they'd all lay down and die...   and do so with a grateful sigh.      Who am I? Why...      I'm Mr Handsome!

Progress      The dome’s been in place   for a generation now      The word rain    has been deleted   from the dictionary,   another unknown soldier   without a grave      It’s twenty-four degrees centigrade today,   inside and out,   and we all will have   synthetic pork   for dinner this evening,   as decided by vote      My mother remembers when   education was an    important commodity;   now it is all genetics and   pre-decided training   taken in pill form:   my two year-old son will be   a city clerk, pushing   virtual papers around an   environment that is virtually   devoid of spark      He was our second attempt,   the first deemed “not viable”   moments after conception;   my assigned wife still says that   the fallopian reset process is pain- and meaningless,   but will not talk about    the 3am tears      Beneath the imitation-night sky   I wonder at my lack of wonder   of rage:   has Man always been this way   or was there once something more,    an ember in His heart   searing, burning, screaming to fly free   to the horizon   the stars   and beyond!

20090219205219AAKWzgN	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Help i am a emo kid who needs some critics on an emo poem to a girl!!!?	Well here's how it starts:   I saw this chick in the 8th grade and I never got to talk to her until near the end of the 8th grade year. (I barely said a few words.)   In summer, I never saw her and that really hurt because I REALLY like her. Now I am in my 9th grade year and she is in my school.SWEET!=) But here's the problem: I never get to talk to her because of our schedules. We are friends, but she doesn't know that i REALLY like her.=( She knows I am emo and...well I recently found out that she is emo too! We both pretend to be happy when we're not! She understands me! But she seems to like me as a friend. I haven't asked her anything about our relationship. So I decided to write her a poem and give it tommorrow. (Today is Thursday Feb. 19.) Does anybody think this is a good poem?:      This is what I feel about you      i have always felt alone and hated. my 8th grade year was based on acting.   acting that nothing was wrong when i felt like i was burning in hell.   i almost killed myself a couple of times   but i waited a little bit longer to see if there was   anything to live for. and i actually found something- you.   ever since i saw your beautiful face, i couldn't stop thinking about it.   that beautiful golden brown hair of yours shined blinding light to my eyes   and made me wonder if this is what i can live for.   summer came, and i was sad to know that you weren't there.   it really ****** with my mind. it really did. but yet i desperately waited...   to see if i would ever see your beautiful face again.   well worth it...   i found you this year...hell yeah...   but again i had to continue to ******* pretend   being someone i am not. really ******* hurts.   had to cry myself to sleep some more.   i wanted to know you better. but it was extremely hard,   since i never have a chance to talk to you (AT LEAST EVEN SEE YOU!)   but i have been getting more chances lately.   it really pleasures me to know that you're here. that you are nearby.   i savor your presence! i always did.   one day, i had no idea that i would find out what i did.   your life was as full of **** as mine! i wasn't the only one pretending!   both our hearts were darkened by the only thing that kept us here on this   goddamn planet: life!   it felt so ******* good knowing i was not alone! that someone understood   and cared. but yet i am still not happy. you DON'T DESERVE all this ****   life forces you to take! you DON'T ******* DESERVE to have to pretend,   then bleed to death later! WHY MUST LIFE TREAT YOU THAT WAY?!   i bleed when i know this happens to you. it sickens me to my soul.   i bleed for that because i love you. if i didn't, i wouldn't be here letting you know that.   i always think about you. it is a hell of a distraction (the best goddamn distraction ever)   you're so damn beautiful.   hell does not exist. life IS hell! but i don't care if i'm burning   at all...just as long as i'm burning with you.

My teacher says grabbing her books off the overhead and heading back to her desk.'and stay quiet'.   I took out my notebook, and passed a note to my friend. There were about 10-20 minutes left of class. After a little bit Robert, who sits next to samantha, asked for the notebook. After she gave it to him. He wrote something down and passed it back to me.   Do You Like Dylan?   Eww, No!   Why   Because   I think He liks You   So   Why dont you like him?   Because   Because what?   I like someone else   Dylan:    What are you guys talking about?   Me:    Nothing         Who?   Why should i tell you?

Robert:    No, I am telling him   Me: I   f You dont i will tell you who likes you   Robert:    Who, And if its *forgot her name* i already know   Damn!   Me:    No it wasnt her, but nevermind.   Robert:   tell me or i am going to tell joel you like him.   Me:   He already knows   the sad thing is he does but i still dont want robert to tell him because then he will think i was talking abnout him even though i was      Robert:   I am going to tell him again.   Robert got up and went to sit by joel.    They talked for a second. I had my head in my hands so i dont know what they are talking about me or if they looked towards me.    "Robert go back to your seat!"    somethimes i love teachers    Robert comes back and decides to piss me off even more by telling the people around us. Some already new and others just stared at me.    i hate him so much!   Dylan((whispers)):   I am telling him   Me:    I dont care he already knows   i mumbled putting my head in my hands.   Dylan obviously didnt beleive this.   Dylan:    No he doesnt   Robert cuts in:    Yes he does.   Dylan still doesnt beleive us   Robert:    Joel dont you know kamille likes you?   robert yells across the class room.    Me:    Kill Me! Kill Me now!   I mumble putting my head back in my hands.   Samantha pats my back.   Joel: yeah   he says nodding.   The teacher comes and gives robert a detetion and the bell rings. **** walks over to my desk.   Me: I hate my life    i mumble to her.   ****:   You always say that   Me:   this time i mean it   she laughs can you beleive that laughs righ in my face.    Me:    were you completely oblivious to the last 10 minutes of class?   **** ((Laughing)):   I'll Meet you in the pod at lunch.   Me:   Sure   I grab my things and shove them in my book bag walking towards the door that leads to the pod.   ****:   Bye   Me:   Bye   I walk past robert and kick him.   Me:   I hate you   he laughs what is up with people laughing at me?   Robert:    Hey Everybody. Kamille likes Joel, that girl right there running away.   i seriously hate him   I walked into class sat down and started hitting my head repeatedly on the desk. and what sucks the most is that was only second period.    Authors note::.   Ok this is a true story, real names, real people. and i am writing this from memory so it may not be completely acurate but thats basically how it turned out. ok lettme explain the whole 'Robert' thing.   sometimes were friends, sometimes were enimes.   and joel actually found out in seventh grade that i liked him but i didnt think that he knew i still liked him. omg i have to delete that journal i wrote. oh and if you want to here the tragic story of when he actually found out message me.   read. comment. message.

Renesmèe was born on the tenth of september, on page 525 of BD it says, "often when I looked back over my first three months as an immortal." So it is december. It takes time for the Volturi to come and Bella has to find the mysterious J. Jenks. So does anyone know when it ends? 10 points to best answer, in the minimum 4 hours or tomorrow.

20090219223200AAqEgpW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What does this phrase mean?	I was reading the book ticking by Matthew Condon and I came across a really interesting sentence:   'they unfold concurrently, and it produces an odd dynamic, where the ill person both exists in real time, and simultaneously does no exist in the present, but becomes a CHILD OF ALL TIME.' the  part talks about how sometimes people may linger in life when they're time is really over. but what does 'child of all time' mean?
