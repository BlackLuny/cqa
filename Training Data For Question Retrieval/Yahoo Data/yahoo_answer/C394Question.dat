Living in a rental; the owner and Real Estate agent have asked me to get the lawn back up to standard after the previous owners let it die off and go patchy.      I have a puppy (10 weeks old) and kitten (13 weeks old) and want to know if there are any ‘pet safe’ fertilisers and/or grass grow/feed I can use that wont harm them?      Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.      I live in Western Australia and have watering restrictions – I can only water on Thursdays and Saturdays.      Thanks
20090219233956AAbFGqM	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	For people who can provide technical info on water meters or who work for the water people, esp in NZ?	I live on the North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand (just letting you know in case you do too & are having the same problem) & a few months ago we had our water meters & water system upgraded in our area. This means we got a whole new water meter. I just got my annual water bill & it's tripled! It says I'm using a large amount of water for a 3 person household. But I am only a one person household & the past bills said I was using a normal amount of water for a one person household. Not only that, but I've just been overseas for 3 months & for the last year I've mostly had showers at the gym, whereas prior to that I didn't belong to a gym so had them at home. I can't have a leak as I just checked the meter (& the meter no. - yes they have read the correct one) & it's not ticking over as it would be if there was a leak. My hot water cyclinder is fine as I checked the overflow pipe & there's nothing leaking out of it. Sounds to me like something went wrong when they installed the meter & maybe they put the meter reading device forward or something or maybe they ran alot of water from my property at the time of installation or something? No doubt the Water company will not take responsibility. If you are a water expert or work in that industry, what do you think?

I had a new electric cooker fitted yesterday and at the moment it's smoking when you turn the hobs on and a smell coming from the oven and grill. The guy who installed it said this happens with new cookers and to leave it turned on for about 2 hours.

20090203114859AAlyuZ0	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	I borrowed my friend's 35 year old sewing machine and it went kaput on me. what should i do?	i sewed hems on two curtains, except didn't finish the last one properly.  then, when the machine was plugged in, but not in use, it made a sound like a lightbulb bursting, but a bit longer and then started smoking near where the spool goes. i unplugged it and put it outside for a few minutes, called a repair place, called my friend. the repair place said it's irreparable, cause impossible to find the 35 year old motor (i live in a major city where space and time is costly and thus people don't keep spare parts around). in any case, this sort of repair would be at least 65 euros an hour plus parts (an old second hand motor, if ever found), whereas a new singer can be bought at about 140 euros.  i don't believe i'm responsable. i told my friend to think about what she thought was right and she asked me to do the same and said she'd check things out on her side. i need to call her.    i think i would offer her 50 euros to go towards a new machine, not a great deal for me, a decent deal for her.  according to the repair person, it couldn't have been my fault, it's just bad luck that the machine broke down on me.

The wood is pressure treated, but needs to be either stained or sealed at some point.  I have gotten many different suggestions on WHEN to do this.  The builder told me that we need to do it before winter sets in, but my bf's friend told him that we should wait until spring because there is too much moisture in the air right now and that the combination of the moisture and cold air will cause any sealant to not take properly and we would have to do it again in a year.  So, I need to know when we should do it and if anyone has recommendations on sealant vs. stain I'd appreciate it!   Thank you!
