Right click on the picture and copy the URL link and paste it when you ask a question. If you want large size images then click 'All sizes' above the photo and paste the 'Grab the photo's URL'.    You could also use these websites: -  http://photobucket.com/  http://fotopic.net/  http://www.snapfish.com  http://www.tinypic.com    ?Photo bucket links may cause Error 999 when you try to upload a picture.

suPD7c3gaa	Once your question has been posted for at least 4 hours, you will see the blue "Choose as Best Answer" button by each answer. After 4 hours have elapsed, just go to your question, then to the answer you want to choose, and click on that button, and follow the steps. If you haven't gotten the answer you need, you can give it a few more days just in case you get more answers, and one that might be better.    (Be careful with the way you offer the 10 points though.  "...whoever can help" could apply to 10 people if 10 people give the correct answer.)|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	? For Your Questions:  You must wait 4 hours before you can pick a best answer. Go to "My Profile" where you will find a list of all your questions. Select the question and there will be a "vote as best answer" button. You receive 3 points for picking one. You will have 4 days to pick one or it will go to a vote. You can also force the vote to start immediately on the edit (pencil) menu.    ? For Someone Else's Questions (and your own after 4 days):  You will have to wait 4 days if the asker did not pick it himself. There will be a "vote as best answer" button. You receive 2 points for voting. You must vote before the vote closes after 2 more days.  You are allowed to vote for your own answer. You just can't answer your own question. Look for questions you can vote on by clicking on "Answer" at the top of the screen and then "Vote" on the tab.    ? ??l???q ?
3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	Lisa, go to your own profile:  Select the My Questions tab    Click on the question you have open.  Under each answer is a button "Choose as Best Answer"  Select the one you want.  You need to rate the answer a number of stars and if you like, can leave a comment for the answerer or other responders.    The question will only show these buttons if the question is four or more hours old.    If none of the answers appeal to you, you can leave it.  After three days it automatically goes into voting and the Answers community can vote for the best answer.|`|7Msk7HhKaa	hehe, go to your answers and at the bottom of the answer itself there's a orange button.
AA11408911	No, the option to vote no best answer can only occur when a question has entered community voting.     While a question is open to new answers, the author of the question can manually select a best answer. If you let the question expire and enter community voting (this occurs by default once a question has been posted for four days, alternatively you can manually send a question with two or more answers into community voting by selecting the appropriate option under the pencil (edit) menu) then the option to select no best answer shall become present, however a majority vote must be passed in order to the motion for no best answer to pass.     Questions that are voted to have no best answer are removed from Yahoo! Answers and you five points for asking the question are returned.     All the best  Chrs|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	Only after the vote starts. It that case it counts as a single vote like everyone else.

Build your point total up a little before you ask a question.   250 points, Level 2, with the ability to ask, answer, and vote more and being able to rate (thumb up / down) answers.   Below 250 points, Level 1 again|`|F0h2iFWsaa	Certainly.  Y!A levels are all about the number of points you currently have.  If your point total drops below your current level's minimum amount, you revert to the previous level (and it's lower daily limits).    :o)|`|IxoBFCpTaa	Yes, when you pass a level, you are not ineligible from going back to the previous one. Asking questions cost 5 points. If you have 254 points, you will drop to 249 and will be level 1 again.    Points:  http://s281.photobucket.com/albums/kk228...

Say you have 253 points, and are on level two. If you ask a question, you will go down to 248 points, which makes you a level one user again. If you fall beneath the threshold of the points required to be a certain level, then you will go back down to the previous level. The only time this does not happen if you are on Level 0. If that happens, you will be unable to ask any more questions until you get enough points to do so. Hope this helped!|`|hWc65sEtaa	Yes you can.

If your account was suspended, it was most likely permanent.  If you created another Yahoo! account though which you also created another Yahoo! Answers account, and you had the 240 points another account, you can't transfer the points from one account to another.  Regardless of the reason, 240 points isn't a lot of points.

Be respectful in what you write.     2. Give a reasonable reason as to why you asked such a question from the first place.     3.  Apologize if you have  crossed their guidelines.      WHAT YOU MUST NOT SAY:    1. Do not say a Troll reports you.     2. Do not rant about you see worse contents being left on the site.     3. Do not tell them you feel they aren't looking at your appeals.     I hope this helps.|`|AA11252878	When making an appeal, you must do the following:  1. Keep your appeal brief and to the point  2. Stick to the subject of the appeal-explain why your content was not in violation of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service  3. Be very polite when making an appeal    You must refrain from:  1. Explaining why other posted content is worse than yours  2. Explaining how sad, disgusted, or upset you are over the violation  3. Blatantly accusing Y! of bias or censorship  4. Threatening the company or its staff.|`|sDKCX43caa	With out understanding the rules, what you term as legal and what they do can be poles apart.

There's a person who "reports" me in the politics section who has two accounts and gives me the two hits required to take somebody out.

Probably the same gender as you are. Some people get crazy and take this venue to a whole new level.     If so, let Yahoo know that you have a "REPORT"-ing stalker and ask them to verify the members who reported you to see if it is personal. At least you will have put them on notice. (not that they can't restart...but they will be more careful since you challenge the reports and you got them busted)    That is the method I used to get them to take a closer look at my "violations". Use the rules that Dad posted...good tips.    Selecting a best answer quickly safeguards your question from removal.     Some get deleted if they have zero answers after a certain amount of time, so check that.

While the exact formula for getting a TC badge is Y!A secret. it's a general belief that to get a TC badge you need to have at least 10% or more Best Answer overall first - then, IF you also have over 10% BA in a particular category, you will get a TC badge.     You can also lose the TC badge if you have not contribute to Y!A for a while and/or your BA percentage goes below what is required to stay TC for that category.  As Y!A Help page says "The top contributor badge is dynamic you earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a particular category. The more actively you contribute, the more likely you will earn a badge. "    My advice - Don't get too crazy about NEEDING to get a TC Badge. It does not give you any extra points nor does it give you any extra privilege in Y!A. It does not make you immune to trolls nor reports or account suspension. (speaking form experience).    Life's too short to take Y!A too seriously.

It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 % "Best Answers" in your chosen category to although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret.    The criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).

You can hold Top Contributor badges in up to 3 lowest-level categories at once (except ''Polls & Surveys'' and ' Jokes & Riddles''). Badges come and go on Monday mornings. Yahoo keeps the formula secret, and it's subject to change at any moment. It probably also varies from category to category. Experienced users have formed guesses, but they're just GUESSES.    You probably need around:    ? 30-50 answers per week in the category.  ? At least 20 ''best answers'' in the category within the last 3 weeks.  ? 200 or more total points per week (including all answers, Best Answers, votes, and "thumbs up") in the category.  ? At least a 10% best answers in your chosen category.    If your level of participation falls, you will likely lose your badge. Concentrate on participating regularly and giving high-quality answers in just a few categories to earn or keep a badge.    Good luck.

sDKCX43caa	You should have seen add more detail but that means the people who have already answered you question will not see the changed question.    You can't reword the entire question as that is unfair, and could make perfectly valid answers to you original question totally incorrect..    Just ask the question again|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	All you can do is add a detail (comment) to your original question.

sQu3LLqtaa	If you click on the Privacy Policy at the bottom of the page below all the flags it turns out that privacy, in fact, means very limited privacy.    Whatever you post in Yahoo!

You would really be surprised where your answers and questions are showing up and sites that claim you are a member. Yahoo tries to say they don't always do this, that other sites are "scraping".   There are many more who have asked this question. Yahoo forum has posts on it, too.   You have no rights to anything you post or your own name... evidently... when you sign onto Yahoo.
e63450517215908d3a9a820dd7193140aa	It doesn't work with Yahoo Mail Classic or New Yahoo Mail.    Mail plus is needed for pop forwarding to use with outlook and other mail progs which have the read receipt option, but it costs 19.99$ a year for US accounts (free for UK accounts).     Note: even when using mail plus or any of the other mail progs, you do not have the guaranty that you get a read receipt because a recipient can opt out of sending such notices. Reason behind this: by denying a read receipt, you make sure that spammers don't know whether they hit a real mail address.|`|suPD7c3gaa	There is no way of knowing if an email you sent was opened and read.|`|8cDd70dSaa	You can elect to attach a sort of receipt to it before you send it. When the recipient opens the message, a message is sent to you informing you.

I9yHqIkJaa	and your question is????
GwwcqUCoaa	You dont want answers. And what in the heck is the meaning of "I want an answer that has some responsibility towards the future!"? Responsibility toward the future?... go stare at a crystal ball.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	First & foremost, it IS a racist observation. They knew the minute that Obama was elected & that was more then a few hours notice.They had time to plan & save. As for the New Orleans tragedy, like people everywhere they believed it couldn't happen to them & weren't prepared for it in many ways. They would not have wanted to see their homes destroyed & perhaps thought there was something they could do to prevent it. No good you insulting me as you have your fellow Americans because I am a white Australian & people like you make me sick. How much did you do for the people of N.Orleans? Precious little is my guess. I feel for the plight of those affected, & I am more then happy for Obama's win at the polls. Maybe he will be able to rid his country of biggots & red necks who feel superior to others because of their colour.|`|0lV2C78xaa	A few hours notice? People planned the inauguration for WEEKS!!!    Not all 2 million were African Americans.    Those that didn't leave New Orleans for the most part had no other option!    Same people? It costs MONEY to go to the inauguration, those that couldn't leave mostly stayed because they had NO money!    And you talk about small brains, this is the tenth time I've answered this exact same question, try being original next time!    Also, I've seen plenty of paychecks. Still a democrat :)      ALSO, if anything Katrina was a class issue, not a race issue.

N16coDrUaa	You can perform free email lookup by using;    http://www.ipaddresslocation.org/email-t...    Only what you need is email header from email sender.    Regarding reverse email lookup where some site's claim to trace person if you enter email address do not believe it. It is almost impossible because 90% of people do not share their email address information's.    But you can still obtain a lot from email header and then later perform Whois lookup and you will get even more.|`|ksx4HxMeaa	There are no free ways to do a reverse email search, however, I do use a cheap paid company because I do a lot of reverse email lookups. See my source. It is a really good service that I pretty much use everyday, so it is worth the cheap price I paid. Plus I also, look up phone numbers, do background checks,etc. I really don't know what I would do with out it.

All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.co m/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Flp...|`|fsLMFIpgaa	You have to get to 250 points before you can.
