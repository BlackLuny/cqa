If you have a HDMI connector on DVD and TV use that. You will have to purchase a cable. It's almost  HD, it looks really awesome. As close to HD as you can get without purchasing a HD DVD player and HD DVD.
hJP9y6kjaa	<br>  The difference is largely how modular you want your setup, how loud you want to be, and how heavy you want your gear to be.<br>  <br>  Buying a separate head and cab means you can swap out your cab and get a different sound, or buy a different head and get a whole new thing going on, without having to find a new set of speakers.<br>  <br>  4 12" speakers pushes more air than 2 12" speakers, and will sound significantly louder. Sometimes you don't want to be too loud, though - it depends what you want. Playing in your room or in a garage or something, a 2x12 would be just fine. Blues, some classic rock, church worship, etc gigs are just fine for 2x12's also. If you're playing clubs, or playing rock, metal, punk, aggressive, etc, then you'll want a 4x12 so you can be heard over the drums.<br>  <br>  Finally, weight is an issue, especially when you have to lug this stuff over long distances on a regular basis. Heavy weights + little moving is okay, but you want lighter weight if you're doing gigs and constantly loading/unloading your gear.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tone purists will be quick to point out that the best sounding amps are by and large *not* digital in any way. By and large the best amps are tube amps, but of course it depends on what you want, what you can afford, and what your style of music is. Fender tends to be great for cleaner tones, but I think their distortion blows. On the other hand, Marshall is the classic rock amp brand, etc.<br>  <br>  So, the best quality of amp tends to be tube. Don't go crazy on watts, you should never ever need more than 100 watts for any reason whatsoever. Even if you're gigging, you shouldn't need more than 50-70 watts of a tube amp, although you may need a full 100 w for a solid state amp. Tube amps sound louder - technically its distortion that causes this, but the extra volume comes from even order harmonics (mostly) that tend to sound musically pleasing to the ear, so we don't hear them as distortion per se (until it starts really distorting, that is).<br>  <br>  Don't skimp on a cab. The biggest boost in quality you can get for your guitar setup is usually a better speaker cab. I have a Marshall 1960a that just screams - 75w "Greenback on steroids" speakers for a total of 300w overall. My buddy has a Marshall cab, too, a 100w model with Celestions even, but when he plugged his amp into my cab the difference was massive! Tighter and fuller lows, crisp top end, and a solid mid. Much heavier overall. Of course, there's a 300-something dollar difference between the two. =)<br>  <br>  One of the fun things about buying a tube amps is expirimenting with different tubes in it. Talk to your guitar tech for more information, but suffice to say there is a world of flexibility out there. With EL34 power tubes I get a sweet, sweet treble and reduced lows for a very British sound, tweed-y crunch and all that. With 6L6's the amp returns to being pure snarly aggression. =) And of course I love those JJ spiral wound preamp tubes...<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul

However, I would suggest starting with the first one, Prophecies.  Another good start would be Guild Wars: Platinum Edition, which is Prophecies and Eye of the North packaged together.

AA10492776	All HDTVs have video lag. Rear-projection TVs tend to have more video lag than a plasma or LCD HDTV. There is no way to fix this lag in your TV unless your TV has a Game Mode. Game modes allow a TV to reduce its video buffering, the source of video lag. Without a Game Mode, there is not much that you can do to reduce video lag in your TV.

All in all if you like live the feeling of being in the game and want a good game experience go ahead and buy it. personally i play my xbox 360 more|`|a785d8770ced9b71af535bf7ee9f07a5aa	Who doesn't want a Wii?<br>  <br>  It's great exercise!! :)|`|e97cca15190ac62a53f399ab1b5eec82aa	sorry i don;t have a wii|`|osGUFsy7aa	Yep, I have one<br>  Its cool and all, depending on your game.<br>  Its fun for a little bit<br>  But i sort of like using just normal controls for it<br>  Its more for like..short games i guess you can put it.<br>  Not long games where you have to go through about hours and hours to get to the end|`|x47gXbN9aa	I find the wii disappointing.

Ent?o, teremos... R$ 8.700.000,00.                      Isso mesmo!                                                         Oito milh?es e setecentos mil reais,                                que o povo brasileiro gastou                                  ( e gasta ),                                                            em cada pared?o!<br>  <br>  Suponhamos que a Rede Globo tenha feito um contrato "fifty to fifty" com                                                                        a operadora do 0300, ou seja,                                                                        ela embolsou R$4.350.000,00.                               Repito:                                                             <br>  <br>  Alguém poderia ficar indignado com a Rede Globo e a operadora de telefonia ao saber que as classes menos letradas e abastadas da sociedade, que ganham mal e trabalham o ano inteiro, ajudam a pagar o prêmio do vencedor e, claro,                                                        as contas dessas empresas.<br>  <br>  Mas o "x" da quest?o,                                      caro(a) leitor(a), n?o é esse.                                                                                           é saber que paga-se para obter um entretenimento vazio, que em nada colabora para a forma??o e o conhecimento de quem dela desfruta;<br>  <br>  mostra só a ignorancia da popula??o, além da falta de cultura e até vocabulário básico dos participantes e, consequentemente, daqueles que só bebem nessa fonte.<br>  <br>  Certa está a Rede Globo.                                                                   O programa BBB dura cerca de três meses. Ou seja, o sábio público tem ainda várias chances de gastar quanto dinheiro quiser com as vota??es.<br>  <br>  Aliás, algo muito natural, para quem gasta mais de oito milh?es                                      numa só noite!                                                                 Coisa de país rico como o nosso, claro!<br>  <br>  Nem a Unicef, quando faz o programa Crian?a Esperan?a, com um forte cunho social, arrecada tanto dinheiro.<br>  <br>  Vai ver, deveriam bolar um                                      "BBB Unicef".

O projeto morreu na fase inicial,                                                   de testes de audiência.<br>  <br>  A raz?o? O nível das conversas diárias foi considerado muito alto, ou seja,                                                                        o público n?o se interessaria.<br>  <br>  Programas como BBB existem no mundo inteiro, mas explodiram em terras tupiniquins.

Nessa edi??o do BBB, eu só vejo gente igual, muito horm?nio sobrando e um tanto de futilidade. Seria interessante para um filme erótico, um clip de música pop, mas pra um reality show é de encher a paciência. Se eu fosse escolher participantes para um programa desses, escolheria pessoas bem diferentes, porque é aí que está a gra?a da coisa. é como a novela das oito, Páginas da Vida, n?o sei se você assiste. Temos ali personagens sem sal (Lívia), com muita pimenta (Sandra), com muito problema (Marina) e personagens malvados que vivem perturbando a paz dos outros (Marta, irm? Má...). é essa variedade de comportamentos que faz a pessoa ficar assistindo. A maioria das pessoas querem ver as pessoas vivendo conflitos, alegrias e sentimentos fortes na tela da tv.

Try it online first.|`|4TQYs8AKaa	yeah its a simple ESN switch! call in to customer care 18009220204 and tell them u want to do this and they will help u out! u can find the ESN behind the phone under the battery it says ESN HEX or ESN DEC. usually its DEC  but let the representative if its otherwise.  as long as the new phone is E911 compliant and isnt on the lost or stolen list everything should be A OK! they will help u out w the rest and tell u how to program it!
AldVQzuKaa	I like the Zen versions M and V plus both support video but the M has a higher capasity, and the V plus has 8 GB as it's highest capacity. I personally own a Version M, its a great mp3 player, it is very easy to sort through long libraries of songs, has more features then say an ipod... and it has a great screen. <br>  Although I should point unless your mp3 player is an Ipod you will not be able to get anything off of itunes. But not to worry... you will probably use limewire anyway. If you don’t want to then you can burn your songs to CDs, rename them, and then re download them off of the disc. <br>  There are programs that allow you do to accomplish this without the use of CDs Such as: NoteBurner It basically lets you instead of selecting a disc in your disc drive as the location of the burned it burns them straight to your hard drive, in mp3 format. <br>  Plus Zen’s support a large variety of Video formats. You can go to <a href="http://vixy.net/" rel="nofollow">http://vixy.net/</a> to download any YouTube video to your computer in the format you want.

1FqJyyjaaa	Depends on how music you got and if you want video.  The latest generation (5th) has video on it and comes in 1,2, 4, 30, 60, and now 80 GB i believe.  I have the 30 GB because I have lots of music but want to watch videos and TV shows as well.  If you're not concerned with video then you can still get an older 4th generation model, or even older but I wouldn't recommend it.  <br>  <br>  It comes with the USB connecter and the white headphones.  I bought something to hook up to my car to play it in my car and I bought a good sturdy case to put it in so that I can take it anywhere, drop it, and it doesn't get scratched.  I have 1 scratch on my iPod because I got a case before I even used it.

uXXbegw5aa	I think it was Jerome Lemelson|`|9mTctb7jaa	The camcorder, single piece camara and recorder, was invented by Kodak in 1981 when the sales of their 8 mm film plummeted for home use. Kodak made them for about 2 years and gave the technology to Sony. The only problem with the original camcorder is it did not have the CCD imager (invented by RCA).  Sony had a license for the CCD and created a consortium of other ex-8 mm movie camera producers, ie Canon, Kyocera, Nikon, et al.  This is the system we now know as Video8 and the father to Hi8.    VHS and Beta both had battery operated versions for field recording in the mid70s. Portable video recording goes back to the EIAJ half inch reel recorder days, mid 1960s. And cameras themselves to the first era of television in the 1930's

Ganz einfach: im Internet hast du nichts weiter als die Worte des anderen. Sicher kann man sich im ersten Moment nicht sicher sein, ob der andere auch wirklich die Wahrheit spricht, wenn er mit dir kommuniziert, aber je l?nger du mit dieser Person in Kontakt bist, desto eher wei?t du sie einzusch?tzen. <br>  <br>  Dadurch, dass es im Net NUR die M?glichkeit der Konversation gibt, ist man gezwungen miteinander zu reden und so nutzt man zum Beispiel 2online-Stunden mit einer Person effektiver als 2 reale. Du erf?hrst viel schneller, was der andere mag, was er ablehnt, wovon er tr?umt - was ihn ganz einfach ausmacht. Und ist es da wirklich ein Wunder, dass man, wenn man auf einer Wellenl?nge schwebt, sein Herz verlieren kann? Ich glaube nicht *l?chel*. <br>  <br>  Und dennoch wirst du nicht drum herum kommen, deine "Internetliebe" kennen zu lernen, denn du l?ufst zwar die Gefahr, dass es real nicht so ist, weil das Aussehen vll. nicht ansprechend ist, oder aber der Geruch oder was auch immer (man liebt doch mit allen Sinnen :-) ), aber wenn du es nicht riskierst, wer wei?, vielleicht würdest du dich ja immer fragen: "Was w?re gewesen, wenn ...?"<br>  <br>  Liebe Grü?e

From Anatomy of The Tongue In Cheek I would recommend Pressing On, Breakdown, Failure To Excommunicate, May The Horse Be With You and Maybe It's Maybeline. From Two Lefts Don't Make A Right... But Three Do, I would recommend Chapstick Chapped Lips and Things Like Chemistry, Forward Motion, Falling Out, In Love With The 80s and College Kids.

MGS4 is also a fantastic shooter, and it is A MUST BUY for any ps3 owner. you wont find better.<br>  <br>  2. Ratchet and clank is flipping amazing. a fantastic platformer, that is well balanced with platforming and action. this game is also a must get.<br>  <br>  3. Wipeout HD is pretty fun. it can be found on the psn store and is like $20-$30 bucks. really fun. of course it has hover cars and stuff, but for a cheap price and great online, you can't go online. if your looking more into a car game, then wait for motorstorm 2 that will be out this year. <br>  <br>  <br>  for your first game i recommend MGS4, just because it's amazing. i'm on my 3rd time through this story and 50 hrs of gameplay racked up online. it's so much fun. then uncharted because it's the game most like tomb raider|`|BW0FbVYraa	alright i will divide them into categories for you.<br>  <br>  FPS:  <br>  resistance:  fall of man (great game, amazing story and online. only $29 because it is greatest hits. ) <br>  <br>  COD4 not good as resistance, but a really fun game no doubt. <br>  <br>  haze? lol what were you thinking :P )<br>  <br>  PLATFORM:  <br>  get uncharted: drakes fortune, just get it! it's amazing, if you liked tomb raider. then you will LOVE this game.  (renting is also good. a bit short, but damn is it sweet. <br>  <br>  new tomb raider game will also be out soon. it won't be close as good as uncharted. but i think you will like it. <br>  <br>  prince of persia, new one coming very soon. not my series, but very popular.<br>  <br>  DRIVING: <br>  <br>  Burnout paradise: very fun game, its less realistic, but damn is it fun. it's not simulator so if your into realism this isn't for you.  damn fun though (only $29) just a bargain<br>  <br>  grand tourismo prologue: a hard ******* game, great simulator. gets frustrating at times, because some of the races are close to impossible. still haven't finished it :D<br>  <br>  OTHER: GTA IV fits all the categories, so highly recommend it. really fun game. <br>  |`|AA10409791	Resistance: Fall of Man is easily the best FPS on PS3. and it's an exclusive title. the sequel will be out next month. other games:<br>  <br>  exclusive:<br>  <br>  LAIR(unusual controls turned off a lot of gamers, and it's pretty short, but i liked it)<br>  Heavenly Sword<br>  Uncharted: Drake's Fortune<br>  Folklore<br>  Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction<br>  Gran Turismo 5: Prologue<br>  Warhawk(online only)<br>  LittlebigPlanet(due out this month)<br>  Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots<br>  (Killzone2, inFamous, God of War 3, Heavy Rain all due out next year)<br>  <br>  multi:<br>  <br>  Assassin's Creed<br>  Call of Duty 4<br>  Guitar Hero 3: and the aerosmith version)<br>  RockBand<br>  Civilization Revolution<br>  Unreal Tournament 3<br>  NCAA/Madden 2009<br>  Dead Space(due out next week)<br>  (Final Fantasy 13, Brutal Legend, Ghostbusters, and a few others due out over the next year or two)|`|fLF2VM8uaa	If you go online to play you should try Warhawk.

r9lfDeRmaa	If your CD player is older it might not be compatible with CD-R. Try doing some research on the brand of player.    if that doesn't pan out, you might want to check your CD again you could have burned it as data rather than audio.

I think it may be your player though.|`|3fe0d36dfe874f978e205152d212f8cbaa	you need to change the settings on your cd writer, sometimes the default setting means the cd will only play on the computer that wrote it.|`|MoOTioVKaa	How old is your CD player?

Any router that supports Wireless-B networking will work (including newer Wireless-G or Wireless-N routers, as long as they aren't configured for G- or N-Only operation).

6W7nJYskaa	I don't know that it is the amount of downloads that is causing your issue. I mean I play the Sims2 as well and I have over six thousand files. I'm on a desktop but we are using the same amount of RAM and mine does take about 5mins to load but it does get there.    Anyway what I would suspect is a bad file in your download folder. Did this start happening after you downloaded new stuff? If so I would suggest deleting all of the files you last downloaded, or at least moving them out of that file to a temporary place on your desktop, then starting your game again and see what happens then. If it works great! you could then put the files back one by one till you find your problem.    The reason I don't think that it is sheer numbers is that you have a robust system with good amounts of RAM and the Sims2 can cope with much more custom stuff than you have got already. Yeah it takes a while to start but once it does it's fine.    Give what I suggested a go and I hope it works for you, I know what it's like to be bored at home and how annoying it is to have your favourite game not start!     :-)    P.S. to find out exactly what it is on your Pc go to START then SETTINGS then CONTROL PANEL then PERFORMANCE AND MAINTENANCE then SEE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR COMPUTER.    This will bring up a pop up window with the basics about your laptop. It's handy to know how to find this stuff because when there is a problem it's the first thing people want to know :-)      EDIT: O.k. my second thought would be a conflict between one file and another. As in one hack conflicting with another. I would still suggest going into the download file yourself and sorting the files by DATE CREATED and as I say move all the files you installed last manually. I know it's tempting to use the Clean Installer because it's a bit easier but it probably won't show up the conflicting files. :-)|`|Dso7k3sjaa	It is possible that it is a piece or pieces of custom content causing your problem even after you deleted all the hacks and duplicate files using the sims2pack clean installer.  So, what I would do if I were you and I didn't want to get rid of all of my cc (no way!  couldn't stand playing without my cc!) is I would pull the folder that has the cc out of the game folders.  Then I would go back into the game folders and make a new, empty downloads folder and start putting the cc back in small amounts.  Playing my game in between to make sure it was still playing correctly.    If you need to know where the downloads folder is really located, could you tell me if you have Vista or XP?  I could write where to find it in both, but that takes up so much space.  So, edit your question to let me know if you have Vista or XP and I can tell you where to look for your downloads folder.    eta -- in case you don't want to respond to my question, here is a guide you can read that explains how to locate and remove cc that's causing a problem:    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...    **2nd eta -- If you are ever having trouble with your game and you think it might be cc, then just pull your Downloads folder to your desktop and then play your game without any cc.  If your game works okay, then you have something in that folder causing problems.  When that happens, use the link I posted to try to fix it if you already tried fixing it with Clean Installer first and that didn't help.    Oh, and some cc is actually put in the folder called Saved Sims.  It's in the same place as the Downloads folder.  If you ever install sims that you got from any website, the cc that sim comes with is put into the Saved Sims folder.  Sometimes that kind of cc can also cause problems -- especially skin files.  So, if you have anything in that folder, you might want to pull it to your desktop as well -- just to check to see if it was causing any problems too.
YETEt0Dqaa	No u can't     u have to upgrade ur contract to get more texts
9mTctb7jaa	DAT is for audio recorders. The cassette is about a quarter inch deeper than miniDV and it is not quite as thick. The reel hubs are similar to an audio cassette which can be flipped over. The reel hubs on miniDV are like VHS, one sided only. DAT tape is metal particle and miniDV is metal evaporate, they are not compatible. Also the door mechanism that opens up when inserted into the player works entirely differently.
J6hMlpncaa	Yes Sony use a M2 memory card, I have personally bought one from mymemory.com and you can get a 4GB for 12.99!!    I've pasted the link in the source|`|LzSj90pbaa	Theres three issues to deal with. The first is: can the phone handle that big of memory card? it will say in the users manual what the maximum data amount of a card can be. The next is speed. Do not buy any card slower then a class 6, or your phone may not be able to use it. Thirdly is the sd-sdhc issue which may or may not apply to you. Im pretty certain the majority of SE phone use M2 cards (if that is the case with your phone, then quit reading), but if theres a chance it uses and SD, SD is not SDHC. If it supports SDHC, then an SD card will work. If it only has support for SD, an SDHC card will not work.|`|tTzHU1rmaa	try get the same memory card with a higher amount of memory. Or try maplins, they are good for memory cards and tht :]
