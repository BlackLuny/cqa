20090222220519AAM3vOs	Travel;Asia Pacific;Korea	Has the current recession made Taiwan or China more profitable for teaching English in than Korea?	I was looking at a 5 year currency conversion chart for Korea, Taiwan, and China. While a year ago, Korea was much more profitable for teaching english than Taiwan, the volatility in the Korean Won has drastically reduced the amount you'll get when you come home and convert your earnings to US dollars. For example, I was looking at listings for Korea that mostly paid 2.3 million Won a month. A year ago, that was 2500$ USD, now, with the depreciation of the Won, that's only $1500 USD. Taiwan's currency has been much more stable since the recession began, making most jobs today able to make at least $1800 USD. On a final note, China is one of the only currencies in the world that has gotten stronger against the US dollar since the recession, but I'm not sure if english teachers in China get paid even close to as much as Korea or Taiwan to make the currency issue worth looking into.

Forget the whole Obama scandal, if you can, on this one. If anyone knows, especially people who live in the New York area, this paper is not known for it's ''intellectuality.'' It's like they prepare their readers, as if they're complete imbeciles. They use words like ''nabber'' and ''mugger'' all over the ''NYPD Daily Blotter'' and have Sports reporters who literally make up and start rumors out of their *ssholes.      My dad commonly refers to it as the sh*trag, but I'm sure he's not the 1st to say that... Still though, if anyone has ridden a New York subway, especially in the morning, I'm sure you've seen people read this low-intellegenced paper, trying to look smart while crossing their knee (By the way, men aren't suppose to do that lol) Take a walk around Manhattan and you'll see this paper go to like 10 cents everywhere by noon, because they print out too many copies of this rag.

20090222223901AAtYZyb	Travel;Australia;Other - Australia	Is Australia really the Greatest Nation on Earth?	Ok,   Firstly I am proud to be Australian      But it makes me wonder why for years it has been forced down our mouths by our parents, fellow countrymen, political leaders etc that we live in the greatest nation on earth and are the envy of the world when:      1. Housing is extremely unaffordable, in america apparently you can buy a nice house for 150K, but buy a similar house here it would be more like 550K at the minimum. [Probably due to greedy capitalists who care more about their greed than giving the average Australian a fair chance at achieving the once achievable GREAT AUSTRALIAN DREAM]      2.Everything is so expensive like food, alcohol, car registration, high taxes etc      What do you all think about this???

20090222230131AA2jAq4	Travel;United States;Other - United States	I am sick of Seattle. To what other U.S. city should I move?	I have lived in Washington my entire life and have resided in Seattle for the past 4.5 years. I want to leave this city and state for many reasons, several of which I will list:      1) Too rainy, cloudy, and cold. I love sunshine (as long as the temperature stays below 90 degrees).      2) Too liberal. Although I don't consider myself a conservative extremist, I certainly lean to the right.      3) Too familiar. I've done everything there is to do in this city and am bored. I need to move some place offering new things to do and new places to explore.      4) Too hard to meet men. The young men here (in Seattle) are shy, rude, and/or simply prefer women to make the first move. As my female friends and I have discovered, being asked out by a guy is a RARE occurrence. This is especially true if, like me, you're a Christian and are hoping to meet a nice Christian guy. They are few and far between.      5) Poor job market. Granted, this is the case throughout the entire nation right now but perhaps there is at least one city that is offering some employment opportunities? I graduated from the University of Washington last summer and still have been unable to find a full-time job that pays at least $12 an hour.         With my objections about Seattle and Washington in mind, what city would you recommend I move to and why? I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions, and I would especially love to hear from any former Washington residents. Where did you move to and what do you like/dislike about it? Any particular places you suggest that I avoid? Thanks in advance!
