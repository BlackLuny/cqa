Im not saying that any stereotype is true about everyone or that a stereotype applies to 90% of the people its about. However in general stereotypes sure as hell dont apply to only 5-10% of the people they're about.      I mean really, does acting like stereotypes are completely false really make them go away? Has Political Correctness really gone that far to where people are now in denial about tendencies among their groups? Instead why not acknowledging them and doing something about it like reaching out to your community and letting them know what kind of image the public has of you? If you're an exception why not make yourself known?

I think I have, with water, air, and earth. I also am good in the paranormal range- I hear ghosts sometimes, and I have preminitions more and more.    (It used to be like i'd have one, then a year later it happens. Now it's like I have one, and a day or two later it happens)    They usually come in bursts up to a month long. They usually happen in my sleep. It'll sometimes go crazy, then it will calm down, then go back to crazy ect.    Please, I know it sounds crazy, just have an open mind. I am just curious. It may be possible, all you people who dont believe, you dont know everything.   Thanks!   ~Megan

20090307160847AAwZmfN	Society & Culture;Etiquette	DUMB DUMB Board Member.  How can I avoid her being re-elected?	Out little HOA has a 5 person board. One of these members has been on the board for 8 years straigh. It's not a good thing. She has won by default. Nobody else would challenge her and once again she is voted on.       This year was different. Instead of having Priscilla being our President again, we opted for another leader to change things around.. In doing that we are no previe to the fact that Prissy has kept many unknown charges and pay out to vendors and didn't share this with the board. It's against the rules and its an issue. Examples? She told a plumber to go ahead and complete a project and didn't notify us, until after it was done. Our laws state these things MUST be voted on. Tonight I found out she has been paying a vendor for monthly service and we did not know about this, nor does the half wit able to tell us what she was paying them for.       How can we get the dumb one voted off the board when homeowners are so apathetic.. Prissy will be voted back on again unless we are able to get the neighborhood involved and get more candidates...       Really I would like some ideas on how to not have her win again...

20090307111836AAMqiwb	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I ended my friendship with one of my best friends?	We are both in our 20's and we've been best friends since 2001. We were really close for about 6 years until I told him that i'm gay and everything just changed. He started spending less time with me and when I would call him most of the time he would ignore my calls. This morning I invited him out to breakfast and he agreed to come. We ate talked a little bit but i had to get out what was on my mind and i pretty much told him that our friendship is over. He broke down in tears and kept asking why was I doing this to him and that he has always loved me and that he still does. I explained to him how much he has hurt me by ignoring me like I'm no one and that I can't take it any more. I then paid for our food and kissed him on his cheek and said my last goodbyes and left. He's been calling me non stop asking me how could he get my forgiveness and that he'll do whatever it takes to be a better friend. He also admitted that he cut me off because of the fact that I am gay but said he didn't want me out of his life and defiantly didn't want to end our friendship.       Was this a valid reason to end a friendship over?

I have always been attracted to girls but recently I've been looking at some guys differently. I'll see an attractive guy and I'll like to look at him sometimes I'll catch myself taking second glances. I've never had any sexual dreams of men nor do I masturbate to the thought of men but I am so confused because of that attraction. I'll just think to myself, "That guys kind of handsome". I looked at gay porn to see if I would be aroused but instead I felt scared looking at it (thinking I might enjoy it). However, I did think some of those guys in the porn were handsome. I'm so confused because of this attraction and I'd like to know if anyone else is going through this or has and if this is the beginning stage of realizing you are Bi-Sexual. I've read that many people know from an early age who they are attracted to but I can't remember ever being attracted to guys back then.      On a side note this second-guessing of my sexuality started when some people thought I was gay because I have not had a girlfriend yet. I felt they saw something in me that I wasn’t aware of.      Thanks.

20090307143707AARqKwh	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why did Evolution kill science?	First I want you to look around and stare outside your window.  Look at the trees and birds.(Yes, the sun will sting your eyes a bit since you never been outside in a while.)  If you are not outside yet, go!  You can't stay in your mom' basement forever.  Now, while your back at your computer, think for a moment how everything was created.        Would it interest you to know that people use to think that people believed God created it?  I bet your thinking why I am asking these "ridiculous" questions.  I want you to know, are they really ridiculous as you perceive them to be.      Before, your parents would tell you that God did it.  You would say okay and not say how you feel.  In your head you go      "Oh really?  So a "magical" fairytale creature in the sky created everything with his "magical" pixie dust?  Are you really this delusional you sheep?"      We would go investigate further and come a hold new information.  This my friends, is how we came across scientific discoveries.      Now lets examine how they would respond if you so much as questioned God.  So lets just assume you replied with "Do you think perhaps God didn't create everything?"      Your parents first emotion would be anger for threatening their beliefs and the next step after that would be ridicule.   "You don't question God boy!  I don't know who is brainwashing you with this nonsense but you are just being delusional.  Who has been telling you this nonsense?  God is proven, everything else isn't.  End of discussion!!!"      Ouch!  That was harsh!  Why would the parents react that way if they felt so strongly that what they were saying is true?  You can safely say that they are "Closed-minded" for rejecting anything that doesn't fit into their ideology of what they believe to be true.  You guys can agree with that right?      Now today, its a common belief that everything was arisen from evolution.        First I want you to look around and stare outside your window.  Look at the trees and birds.(Yes, the sun will sting your eyes a bit since you never been outside in a while.)  If you are not outside yet, go!  You can't stay in your mom' basement forever.  Now, while your back at your computer, think for a moment how everything was created.        Would it interest you to know that people think that people believe evolution created it?  I bet your thinking why I am asking these "ridiculous" questions.  I want you to know, are they really ridiculous as you perceive them to be.      Now, your parents would tell you that Evolution did it.  You would say okay and you would assume them to be correct you don't believe they would ever lie to you.  Their your parents after all!  Why would they lie?      but some people would go people would go      "Oh really?  So a "magical" unproven theory says that nothing came from nothing and magically created something which magically rearranged itself into self replicating bits which is what made up everything?" ?  Are you really this delusional you sheep?  Do you know how complicated the cell is?  The processes that occur in the cristae within the mitochondria are complex by just that alone?"      We would go investigate further and come a hold new information.  This my friends, is how we came across scientific discoveries.  But now we don't question evolution because if you do you are considered to have no knowledge about science.        Now lets examine how they would respond if you so much as questioned Evolution.  So lets just assume you replied with "Do you think perhaps Evolution didn't create everything?"      Your parents first emotion would be anger for threatening their beliefs and the next step after that would be ridicule.   "You don't question Evolution boy!  I don't know who is brainwashing you with this nonsense but you are just being delusional.  Who has been telling you this nonsense?  Evolution is proven, everything else isn't.  End of discussion!!!"      Ouch!  That was harsh!  Why would the parents react that way if they felt so strongly that what they were saying is true?  You can safely say that they are "Closed-minded" for rejecting anything that doesn't fit into their ideology of what they believe to be true.  You guys can agree with that right?      You see, our skepticism about the current science of the time has propelled our understand of life.  There is a new mannerism now.  We don't question current science anymore.  We accept it with open arms and we fail to discover any other possibilities.      We now believe that there is possibly no other explanation other than the fact that there is no god.  We no longer question current beliefs.        If we even so much think that there is a designer we are ridiculed as being ignorant of science.  We are told that we don't know about the protein pumps within the cell membrane or the fact that only plant cells have a cell wall or even that humans do not have the proper tools to break down cellulose as to which is why we have corn in stool.

Then later he was like I have no butt, and I thought it was cause he wasn't wearing skinny jeans and he was like even with that I don't here feel and he wanted me to touch his butt.

What if God gave us a choice when we were still in the womb, and telling us the advantages and disadvantages of both genders, and what we picked is what we got? And the moment we come out is the moment we lose all memory of what happened, and our communication with God is lost because of our sins?      But this question is not about sin, it's about our genders. Were we the ones that selected it? So if this was true, then transvestites don't have the right to change their genders lol.      Now I want to be a girl, since being a boy is pretty boring. You pretty much can do anything a boy can do, and still look good doing it. You get to wear all those pretty clothes (of BOTH genders as well), make up, nails, and have more variety of hair styles. You are less likely to have diseases and early deaths.

Is the reason why he doesnt show up in mirrors because he's dead, and depends on other humans for blood? thanks! [:

She has everything I've been looking for and when we're together, the chemistry is sooo strong, I get really frustrated. I don't know what to do. How do I respect her space and deal with these feelings. She said that she freaks out whenever anyone starts to like her so I can't talk to her about my feelings. And the weird thing is, I know she likes me too! She just won't allow herself to get involved with me. I don't know, I'm just sooo frustrated and confused! What should I do? HELP PLEASE!

20090307143810AARqXkM	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are biometric passports and subcutaneous electronic CHIPs the sign of the beast, predicted in the Bible?	Romania, my native country, started as her older sister the USA, to implement subcutaneous electronic CHIPs. Outrageously the church approved this law that has to be fully applied starting first july this year. People had a mass reaction on this law especially religiously. However it has to be mentioned that this kind of electronic device will be initially a memory card that contains all personal record (including infractions, economic transaction even the little ones like food purchasing, personal titles and abilities, degrees, all the money u have, bank accounts, credit cards, driving license, etc), but later it will become a tracking device too, maybe even something like a remote control. Although this sounds science fiction, we must remember that the PC that u have before u has been science fiction too a long time ago. It is also known that bar code that these chips have within themselves has the number 666, whatever that means. The Church agreed with these chips maybe because the Prophecy has to be fulfilled so there is no reason to change the law because this is God's will but we may refuse this law. However refusing it will deny u from society, i.e. u may get convicted, even executed (as the Apocalypse says). These Chips makes u a soldier on a huge chess table. U may get controlled any time anywhere. If u disturb the Government you may loose everything u have achieved during a lifetime by just clicking a computer command: all money, degrees, everything. So life becomes totally uncertain unlike it is promised by these chips. If u commit an delict even if u serve time in prison for that, u will always be chased by your sin, because all security sistems will be alerted when you'll go shopping, looking for a job etc. So the Antichrist is the opposite to Jesus: If Jesus washes away your sins, the antichrist doesn't forgive you for the littlest sin. It is also known that everything is tied on earth will be tied in heavens too. So if we will not be forgiven for our sins in earth there we receive no excuse in heaven, so the Sacrifice of Our Jesus Christ will stop working. So are these chips (electronic devices) the sign of the beast or not?

20090225064306AAQzRLH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people run past Paul to kneel in front of Peter, and Jesus or St. Dominic?	As in, many things that people do, Paul either said don't do it or he already set up a way to do thing. St. Dominic says to pray the Rosary, but Paul already spoke about praying. And other things Paul says people don't want to listen to because they say that "focus on Jesus" or "Peter was leader, not Paul".          So why do people completely bypass Paul to go bow to Peter and them?

20090225065657AAsr1yj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I am not Christian so why should I be expected to cook the Easter dinner for my husband's family?	This year I decided that since I am not Christian that really I shouldn't be the one to cook the Easter dinner for my Husband's sisters and their families.  What usually happens is that I am in the kitchen cooking dinner for like 50 people and my sister in laws and hubby's are in the living room bashing the fact I am Pagan.  Then they happily sit down to the dinner that I prepared.   So this year a full two months before Easter I inform them that I am NOT cooking it this year.  If they want one they will have to cook it themselves.  They have plenty of time to figure out something for the holiday.   My Husband agrees with me and tells me that I should have quit doing it years ago.        I am doing an Ostara dinner for my boys, their families and my man in March.        My Husband's family is trashing me because I am not doing the Easter dinner.  YOur Opinions please.

Over the last few weeks really bad things have been happening.   It started when I saw staying at a friends house and she was saying how her dog is really good and stays on the lead, and we took her for a walk and she ran out in the road and got hit by a car.    Then my brother was studying for an exam and passed on paper, then when I gave him some help he failed.   My friend BF asked me to tune his bass and it litterly exploded on stage.   The day before it was announced Lehmans went bust I was on a tour there.   When I visited my Dad's work to pick up a few papers with him, one of the men that worked there jumped off building.   My friend bought a new pair of jeans and put her phone in her pocket and it stayed- that I walked with her and the jean pocket ripped and it fell out.   The night I went to visit my aunt in hospital she died an hour later.      What ever I do someone around me gets hurt or something!      Am I lucky?

It is a wonderful way to advance your career opportunities. College provides a wealth of knowledge. I believe being in college you become more responsible. It brings about more independence and it helps you mature in ways you never thought possible. However, college is becoming more and more expensive. There are grants, loans, and scholarships but tuition should still be lowered. College really pays off in the end. It takes a while to feel as if you have accomplished anything because there are so many classes unrelated to your major but staying focused you will see that there is a bigger picture. College is very challenging and demanding you have to stay focus and more importantly you have to be very optimistic otherwise you will give up.

20090225064635AAjh98V	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The Roman Catholic Church is selling Indulgences again in the good old U S of A!  What's next?	Another round of witch-burnings?      Some elements of the Catholic Church seem intent on getting Medieval on our a***s again.      From  http://macroaxis.com/blog/2009/02/10/buy...       "These days, you can get a deal on anything. Even salvation! Pope Benedict has announced that his faithful can once again pay the Catholic Church to ease their way through Purgatory and into the Gates of Heaven.      Never mind that Martin Luther fired up the Reformation because of them: Plenary Indulgences are back.      The New York Times reports that even though the church officially broke with the age-old practice -- you do something good, and the Church will help absolve you -- in 1960, the Pope has quietly reintroduced it. The Catholic Church had technically banned the practice of selling indulgences as long ago as 1567.      As the Times points out, a monetary donation wouldn't go amiss toward earning an indulgence. It writes, "charitable contributions, combined with other acts, can help you earn one." You can even buy indulgences this way for loved ones who are already dead, greasing their way to Heaven by doing something for the Church here on Earth.      Why would the Catholic Church agree to this reversal? It wouldn't be the harsh economy, would it, or the church's fading influence? Not at all, says a Brooklyn bishop. "Because there is sin in the world," he told the newspaper."      Incidentally, I saw the actual article in the Times earlier this month that this blog references.

Okay, so I am trying to figure out how to "get rid" of someone that we don't care to have in our lives anymore. I hate to use that term, but it is the only way I can think to say it.      So there is this woman that my boyfriend knew before he met me. He never really liked her, but is too nice to tell her that he really doesn't want to talk to her anymore (or ever for that matter). She texts him and emails him all the time and it drives him nuts...but he doesn't want to hurt her feelings.      Now she's trying to become MY friend too!! She was like why can't we all be friends?      I have no interest in becoming friends with her and he has no interest in remaining friends with her. What can we do other than blatantly tell her to get lost? I really don't want to be rude or hurt her feelings, but I am not comfortable with a lot of the things she sends him either. I just want her to move along and bug someone else.      Oh, and her kids are horrible. But he can't bring himself to tell her to go away when she comes over. It really bothers me because I believe it is our right to not have who we don't want in our house or in our lives, but I don't know how to get rid of her.      HELP!!!      Thank you for your ideas.

Talking animals, heroes and villians, complex geneologies to make it seem more realistic, global catashtrophies. All of the makings of a really good fable.      But you know what the best part of a fable is? The moral. People who read genesis literally, in my opinion, completely miss the moral teachings contained therin. It would be like reading the Aesop fable about sour grapes and learning from it that foxes can talk.

Almost everyone, myself included, believes it's better to be rational than irrational.  Yet when I try to develop an argument in support of this, all I can come up with are appeals to consequence.

20090227085330AAzgLHx	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Some Questions About the Trinity Concept in Christianity? PLEASE HELP!?	I am a non-denominational Christian who has been studying this issue of the trinity & "is Jesus God or Son of God" issue for a few months now.      There are some scripture which could possibly be interpreted as Jesus being God, although He never comes out and says this directly. Most Christians take this view and see him as a trinity 3-in-1 deal.      There are just as many (if not more) scriptures that indicate Jesus is not God, that they are different, and that Jesus and God are 2 separate entities, and this even makes more logical sense to me.      Then I look at the history of all of this trinity stuff, and a guy named Arius believed similar to what I am believing, and Anetheniaus (sp?) believed in a sort of trinity concept. The church voted between the two views (hundreds of years after Jesus/Apostles even lived), and went with the trinity concept, and then considered you a heretic if you didn't also believe it and would kill you.      So at this point, I am sort of frustrated, yet I am leaning towards a JW view that Jesus is the Son of God, and not God almighty. The whole Godhead thing makes no sense to me any way I view it. And the fact that it could have been voted the other way and that all of this comes from just 1 interpretation and a "vote" makes me even more frustrated.      So my question is this:       Does salvation even require us to believe Jesus is God? Isn't believing he is the son of God/Messiah who died for our sins good enough as long as we follow God's commands. He says we must believe in him, not that we must believe he is God Almighty. I do believe Jesus was the messiah, he died for our sins, and was resurrected 3 days later. I pray to God and ask for forgiveness for his son's sacrifice.      But I totally view it at this point as there being 1 God, Jesus is God's son, and Jesus is less than God & different being from God.      This whole issue is just so confusing. What are your thoughts on it??      Thanks so much.      P.S. I have literally viewed all scriptures concerning both views (so I know about Jesus saying "I Am", etc etc.

With Allah all things are possible.      The fool hath said in his heart there is no Allah. He is vile and contemptible.      The point I am making here is a "faith" in a "God" is a learned mental repetition, not an intellectual assertion of actuality.Someone says "How?" they say "God". Someone asks "Why?" they answer "God". Instantly.A learned response borne of conditional love.      The linguistic interchanging between one monotheism and other shows how universal and repeated this psychology is.      "It is Satan that turns you away from the Truth of Allah"?   (they actually say that).

Take a look at chimp chromosome 2&3, and at our chromosome two:       http://www.don-lindsay-archive.org/creat...       It is clear to anyone that looks that at some point this chromosome fused, to make our single chromosome as opposed to the two chromosomes of the rest of the great apes. This is not only supported by the similarities, but by vestigial structures within the DNA itself:       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_...       The diagram explains it fairly well. Our chromosome 2 has not only TWO centromeres, right where you would expect them to be should the two previous chromosomes have fused, but two extra telomeres in the MIDDLE of it, right where a centromere should be.

20090307070054AAs1mvN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people think that water is a reference to blood? Why would people want to ignore the real Gift of God?	Christ spoke of the "Gift of God" and he wasn't speaking about blood for sin...      he called the Gift of God "living water."       And of course when a person is baptized, water is used for the ceremony, not blood. So why do people connect the idea of blood for sin when there is a baptism, and think of blood when the symbol is water? Have they lost track of the real "Gift of God" that baptism is symbolic of?      Click on my avatar if you want more context for this question.      To support this question just think about the Baptism that John the Baptist was doing... it was called the "Baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins." His baptism had water also, and was probably a reference to "living water" that washes away sins.... and certainly had nothing whatsoever to do with the crucifixion.

20090227085358AAnhtcn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, is your faith really this weak?	So yesterday I asked a series of questions, probably about 7 of them.  They were all well thought out, well researched and quoted scripture giving examples to back up my theories, and might I add in no way did any of my questions violate any YA rules or guidelines.  Yet I wake up this morning to find that every single one of the questions I had asked yesterday had been reported and deleted.  Is your faith so weak that any question asked on RS that brings to light the contradictions, and lies in your bible warrants such hate that you find it necessary to have it deleted?  I would think that if your faith was as strong as you claim it to be, that nothing I post would result in such an outpouring of hate.  Or is this just another example of Christians attempting to silence evidence that clearly shows how misguided you really are?  How many texts that contradicted your beliefs have the followers of christ destroyed during the course of history?  How many people have been silenced by the church for their opinions?  If this is supposed to be an open forum where all opinions are given space to be voiced, why do you constantly feel the need to have the questions and sometimes answers of atheists deleted?  Also, has this happened to any other atheists out there as I have a feeling that this has happened to others as well?

20090307111932AAuSI3T	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Do you think the "No on Prop 8" campaign failed us?	While the "Protect Marriage" campaign was pulling at the heartstrings of Californians with loads of hysteria and non-sequiturs about the alleged loss of religious liberty and the indoctrination of children if same-sex marriage were to stay legal, the "No on 8" campaign seemed to do everything in its power to keep the campaign from getting personal, with loosely defined appeals to fairness making it seem that all that was at stake was some kind of contractile legal protocol.      Do you think the "No on Prop 8" campaign, in all frankness, sucked?      There are rumors of activists starting a counter-initiative for the 2010 election that will prompt a counter-amendment repealing Section 1 Article 7 of the state constitution. If and when this happens, shouldn't we find a new ad wing that will personify what really is at stake here? Should we make a campaign that unapologetically shows that denying gay and lesbian FAMILIES the same rights as heterosexual ones actually hits home? Why shouldn't we have ads showing how this affects children of same-sex parents? Why shouldn't we actually state unequivocally WHICH rights are at stake, and how the current precedence opens the door wide to other voter abuse in reinstituting discrimination against suspect classes?      In my opinion, the "No on 8" campaign did a pathetic job. The mantra "It's unfair and wrong!" is an understatement and does little justice to the plight of gay, lesbian, and transgendered couples across the state.

20090307114020AAm0ha1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The only way to know about god is through someone else.?	The way I heard of God was through school, and that was controlled. God didnt tell me, people did. so how do I know i can believe people? If someone was lost in a jungle from very little but wolves looked after them, God wouldnt tell him/her, and people cant because there would be no human contact. Sooooo. Is god really real then? Some people feel it in their heart, but would they feel in their hearts about God if no one even told them about God? Also, why did God create stars and planets so far away from earth that it makes no difference? Also, why did God create earth? was he bored from existing forever? and so if he existed forever, didnt that mean something created God, because if God existed forever, why couldnt earth have existed forever? AND, why is there So much Death And Poverty in places in the world? And IF YOU SAY ITS BECause God gave humans free will and humans made it themselves, doesnt that mean the children born there are born into it, its not their fault, if yourself was born in Africa and you would die at the age of 5, would it be your fault that u die at 5? and anyway, if god is all good, why doesnt he help them out? and why is god so mysterious? why cant god come out from hiding? My veiw point is GOD DOES NOT EXIST, I can live my life through without god... just because your parents beleived, think for yourself, does it add up? you know its not real, its just a way of controlling the masses, so there is less crime. Why are humans superior to other animals? because thats what humans want to think. Why didnt god just create paradise for living creatures to experience and nothing else, if god is so good and clever. WHY AM I QUESTIONING GOD? BECAUSE He gave us freewill... hahaha well, no hes not real so I can think what i want. PS (i may have referred to god as he, so dont cry.)

20090307120356AAAQ3Xy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How did Mohammed know this 1430 years ago?	I have recently began looking into the Quran – that is after i have looked into the bible.    Mohammed was an illiterate man (cannot read or write/ uneducated) but yet it is assumed he wrote the Quran.    If this is true, then how did HE (someone who lived over 1430 years ago and was uneducated) know about the water cycle (a discovery made by us less than a hundred years ago by us)?      An Nur Chapter 24 v43   See you not that Allah drives the clouds gently, then joins them together, then makes them into a heap of layers, and you see the rain comes forth from between them. And He sends down from the sky hail (like) mountains, (or there are in the heaven mountains of hail from where He sends down hail), and strike therewith whom He will, and averts it from whom He wills. The vivid flash of its (clouds) lightning nearly blinds the sight. [Tafsir At-Tabari].       Ar Rum Chapter30 V48   Allah is He Who sends the winds, so they raise clouds, and spread them along the sky as He wills, and then break them into fragments, until you see rain drops come forth from their midst! Then when He has made them fall on whom of His slaves as He will, lo! they rejoice!       Az Zumar Chapter39 v21   See you not, that Allah sends down water (rain) from the sky, and causes it to penetrate the earth, (and then makes it to spring up) as water-springs and afterward thereby produces crops of different colours, and afterward they wither and you see them turn yellow, then He makes them dry and broken pieces. Verily, in this, is a Reminder for men of understanding.       Al Mu’minun Chapter23 v18   And We sent down from the sky water (rain) in (due) measure, and We gave it lodging in the earth, and verily, We are Able to take it away.       Ar Rum Chapter30 v24   And among His Signs is that He shows you the lightning, by way of fear and hope, and He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and therewith revives the earth after its death. Verily, in that are indeed signs for a people who understand.       Al Hijr Chapter15 v22   And We send the winds fertilizing (to fill heavily the clouds with water), then caused the water (rain) to descend from the sky, and We gave it to you to drink, and it is not you who are the owners of its stores [i.e. to give water to whom you like or to withhold it from whom you like].       Al A’raf Chapter7 v57    And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (rain). Till when they have carried a heavy?laden cloud, We drive it to a land that is dead, then We cause water (rain) to descend thereon. Then We produce every kind of fruit therewith. Similarly, We shall raise up the dead, so that you may remember or take heed.       Ar- Ra’d Chapter13 v 17   He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and the valleys flow according to their measure, but the flood bears away the foam that mounts up to the surface, and (also) from that (ore) which they heat in the fire in order to make ornaments or utensils, rises a foam like unto it, thus does Allah (by parables) show forth truth and falsehood . Then, as for the foam it passes away as scum upon the banks, while that which is for the good of mankind remains in the earth. Thus Allah sets forth parables (for the truth and falsehood, i.e. Belief and disbelief).       Al Furaqan Chapter25 v48-49   48 And it is He Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (rain), and We send down pure water from the sky,         49 That We may give life thereby to a dead land, and We give to drink thereof many of the cattle and men that We had created.        Fatir Chapter35 v9   And it is Allah Who sends the winds, so that they raise up the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land, and revive therewith the earth after its death. As such (will be) the Resurrection!       Yasin Chapter36 v33-34   And a sign for them is the dead land. We gave it life, and We brought forth from it grains, so that they eat thereof. And We have made therein gardens of date-palms and grapes, and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein.       Al-Jathiyah Chapter45 v5   And in the alternation of night and day, and the provision (rain) that Allah sends down from the sky, and revives therewith the earth after its death, and in the turning about of the winds (i.e. sometimes towards the east or north, and sometimes towards the south or west etc., sometimes bringing glad tidings of rain etc., and sometimes bringing the torment), are signs for a people who understand.       Qaf Chapter50 v9   And We send down blessed water (rain) from the sky, then We produce therewith gardens and grain (every kind of harvests) that are reaped.       Al Waqi’ah Chapter56 v 69-70   69 Is it you who cause it from the rainclouds to come down, or are We the Causer of it to come down?         70 If We willed, We verily could make it salt (and undrinkable), why then do you not give thanks (to Allah)?          Mulk chapter67 v30   Say (O Muhammad  ): "Tell me! If (all) your water were to be sunk away, who then can su

20090307120546AA9LGHe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fellow non-believers who once did?	What was the information you found that finally open your eyes that God was a lie?   For me it was reading the bible. I had read the NT front to back 7 times. then I decide to read the OT from front to back word for word. I highlighted and study the jewish customs of the time so that I might be a better Christian and understand the OT. the more I read and study the more astonished I became with this God of the OT. The horror and the contradictory nature between the God of the OT and the NT. There are more examples than I can list. he point is the bible itself led me to realize it was a lie not science. No atheist needed to convert me, just plain old common sense. So what's your story? and for the believers who read this. Have you sat down on your own and studied your bible honestly and objectively? If you have not maybe you should, and if you have then maybe you should try again.

In the brazilian R&S I've heard things like:      - Did you know the Bible predicted the existence of Y!A R&S?      or       - Who do you think holds the stars and doesn't let the Earth fall??? The gravity?? NO!!! It's the God's ALELUIA!!!!      - Are this catastrophes (flooding because of the rain) taking place in the state of Saint Catarina because the state has a saint's name (and this is a sin)????      - Did you know freemasonry wrote the Bible??      - Did you know that the dinosaurs never existed?? The Devil was the one that put those bones to trick the unfaithful humans!!!!       - What will you do when Jesus comes down from the skies with his axe and cut the heads of the unfaithfuls???? (this is my personal favorite)      And lots more!!!      Do you have this kind of questions here too???? Or fundamentalists here don't exagerate that much??
20090307113513AAsun0L	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Hi, is it true that Jehovah's Witnesses get special health treatment and get the best care at hospitals?	We are catholics and my mother doesn't like Jehovah's Witnesses, but she told our family doctor that we are Jehovah's Witnesses.  When I ask her why she was doing that, she said she want us to be given the best medical care and treatments without the use of blood.

They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."   ~Matthew 22:20-22

20090307112947AA5V1Ob	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	"You have to have faith before God can answer your prayers." BS.?	Why is it, Christians claim that God answers their prayers, because they have faith. And that Atheists can not say God doesn't answer, because we don't have any faith in him to find out?      Has it EVER crossed your minds, that before some people became Atheists, they did have faith? And that they did pray? And that, one of the reasons they stopped believing in "God" in the first place, is because he never fricken answered?      Your arguments for God, are really quite poor.   This excuse is almost as bad as, "If you don't believe in God, you'll go to hell!" or "God did it!"      >_>

20090227090706AAHSpqj	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Profile: Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS)?	On the 13th of the month of Rajab, twenty-three years before the migration of the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) a child was born in the family of Abu Talib(as). No one else, from Adam(as) down through all the prophets, possessed such a distinction. Of all human beings, he alone was born in the sacred precinct of the Ka'ba.   Hakim in his Mustadrak and Nuru'd-din Bin Sabbagh Maliki in his Fusulu'l- Muhimma, Fasl I, p.14, say: "No one before Ali was born in the Ka'ba. This was a distinction given to Ali in order to enhance his honor, rank, and dignity."      When Ali(as) was only thirteen year old He gave answer to the call of the last prophet(pbuh) of Allah(swt). As the feast of the Banu Hashim goes narrated by Ali ibn Abu Talib (AS):   "Apostle said, o sons of Abdul Mutalib, i have known no Arab who has come to his people with a nobler message than mine. I have brought you the best of this world and the next. God has ordered me to call you to him. So which of you will cooperate with me in this matter, my brother, my executor, and my successor being among you? The men remained silent and I (Ali), though the youngest, most rheumy eyed said, o prophet of god, I (Ali) will be your helper in this matter. He (SAW) laid hand on the back of my neck and said, this is my brother, my executor and my successor amongst you. Hearken to him and obey him. The men got up laughing and saying Abu Talib, he has ordered you to listen to your son and obey him.   Life of Muhammad, a translation of Ibn Ishaqs Sirat Rasul Allah, A.Guillaume, pg 118       At the time of migration from Makka to Madina, Prophet Muhammad(pbuh) called Ali(as) and asked him to lie down on his bed to face his enemies, who had planned to kill him during that night, and Ali(as) wholeheartedly agreed to give his life to save the messenger of Allah. In the battle of Badr, Ali was asked by Prophet Muhammad(pbuh) to fight and repulse the hordes of enemy soldiers when many of his companions were quietly watching the fighting from a safe distance.   In the battle of Uhad, when the enemy had an upper hand and the danger to the Holy Prophet's life was imminent, because all his companions had run away from the battlefield and disappeared, it was Ali who stood by the Holy Prophet and brought to naught all the plans of the enemy. In the battle of Khundaq, Ali was called, as the embodiment of faith to fight against the incarnation of disbelief, Amr bin Abdwud, to win victory for the disheartened Muslims. In Khaybar, when all the companions of the Holy Prophet tried and failed to subdue the enemy, Ali was called to come to the rescue of the deficient and depressed Muslims and conquer the fort of Khaybar single-handedly.      At the time of going to Tabuk, the Holy Prophet designated Ali, as his vicegerent, to take charge of the affairs in Madina, saying that Ali was to him as Harun was to Musa.The Final declaration at Ghadir-E-Khum confirmed finally what had been formerly pointed out time and again.      Imam Ali was the undisputed Muslim hero; the war champion, Haider e Qarar (who doesn’t run away from battles), Sher-e-Khuda (lion of Allah), Imam Ali was Prophet Muhammad’s ultimate first choice in all fields. The flag carrier, son in law, war hero, even a successor.      It is narrated from Ubaiullah bin Abdullah that he heard from Ali (AS) saying "I (Ali) am the slave of Allah and brother of his Prophet (SAW) and I am the siddique al Akbar (the greatest friend of Muhammad (SAW)). Whoever claims this for himself after me is a liar. I have prayed Salat with Prophet Muhammad (SAW) for seven years before anyone else prayed"   Tareekh e Tabari, Volume 2, page 65      Loving Ali is a sign of belief and hating him reflects the wickedness of a person, as the Prophet (SAW) himself declared. I guess the amount of believers have been far lesser than those of the hypocrites and disbelievers everytime.

20090227090534AAxZGgQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think Satan convinces people that Genesis is a literal fact?	Which therefore prevents them from seeing the moral lessons behind the fabel that is Genesis? It's like reading the Aesop Fable about the fox and the sour grapes and learning from it "Wow! Foxes can jump and talk!".       Satan is convincing you it is a literal story, so you will not look deeper into it and see the lessons to be learned. If you read the Bible "in the spirit", you will see that Genesis is not literal at all.

20090227090204AAUtejU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people of any religion who say they are Christians not follow the Bible?	They address ones as Father.   Jesus said:(Matthew 23:9-11) Moreover, do not call anyone YOUR father on earth, for one is YOUR Father, the heavenly One. 10?Neither be called ‘leaders,’ for YOUR Leader is one, the Christ(Matthew 23:8) But YOU, do not YOU be called Rabbi, for one is YOUR teacher, whereas all YOU are brothers.      You need pictures and images to pray to but Paul said:(1 Timothy 2:5) For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus,(1 Corinthians 10:14) Therefore, my beloved ones, flee from idolatry.            They say men should not marry and should abstain from certain foods at certain times.   Paul said:(1 Timothy 4:1-5) However, the inspired utterance says definitely that in later periods of time some will fall away from the faith, paying attention to misleading inspired utterances and teachings of demons, 2?by the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, marked in their conscience as with a branding iron; 3?forbidding to marry, commanding to abstain from foods which God created to be partaken of with thanksgiving by those who have faith and accurately know the truth. 4?The reason for this is that every creation of God is fine, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, 5?for it is sanctified through God’s word and prayer over [it].      They say certain men are infallable   The Ezekiel says:(Ezekiel 28:8-9) Down to the pit they will bring you, and you must die the death of someone slain in the heart of the open sea. 9?Will you without fail say, ‘I am god,’ before the one killing you, whereas you are a mere earthling man, and not a god, in the hand of those profaning you?”’      Many churches show off pompus rites and riches (Revelation 18:7) To the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury, to that extent give her torment and mourning. For in her heart she keeps saying, ‘I sit a queen, and I am no widow, and I shall never see mourning.’      But Jesus said:(Matthew 6:20-21) Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21?For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.(Matthew 8:20) But Jesus said to him: “Foxes have dens and birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay down his head.”      Jesus never advocated or preached for money he said:(Matthew 10:7-10) As YOU go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.’ 8?Cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. YOU received free, give free. 9?Do not procure gold or silver or copper for YOUR girdle purses, 10?or a food pouch for the trip, or two undergarments, or sandals or a staff; for the worker deserves his food.(John 10:11-13) I am the fine shepherd; the fine shepherd surrenders his soul in behalf of the sheep. 12?The hired man, who is no shepherd and to whom the sheep do not belong as his own, beholds the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and flees—and the wolf snatches them and scatters them— 13?because he is a hired man and does not care for the sheep.      Why do they say Jesus and God are the same when Jesus said:(Mark 10:18) Jesus said to him: “Why do you call me good? Nobody is good, except one, God.(Matthew 20:20-23) Then the mother of the sons of Zeb′e?dee approached him with her sons, doing obeisance and asking for something from him. 21?He said to her: “What do you want?” She said to him: “Give the word that these my two sons may sit down, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.” 22?Jesus said in answer: “YOU men do not know what YOU are asking for. Can YOU drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him: “We can.” 23?He said to them: “YOU will indeed drink my cup, but this sitting down at my right hand and at my left is not mine to give, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”                     Correct me if i'm reading these scriptures wrong but have we gotten so far away from the Bible and the teachings of Jesus that we are only serving men ?And Jesus said:      (Mark 7:13) and thus YOU make the word of God invalid by YOUR tradition which YOU handed down. And many things similar to this YOU do.”

20090307123718AAUTaMG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	For those who say God is not real, could that be because you don't actually know what reality is?	Christianity teaches that the triune God is the essence of objectivity and subjectivity, fact and meaning, unity and diversity. So, to deny this God is to be stuck with whatever current trendy teaching about reality is in vogue when you become a teenager. Yet if this God created reality, the only way we could experience that reality would be to believe what He says about realities (including the unseen ones). If we exclude God from 'our' reality, whatever we call reality will not be reality, surely?

20090227091334AAX1RZX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians -- How do you rationalize your rejection of Stalin?	You may claim that he put people in the Gulag, but the truth is that Stalin did not send anyone to the Gulag. It was those who hardened their hearts against him who sent themselves to the Gulag through their counter-revolutionary actions.      This was not Stalin's plan at all. He truly wanted everyone to go to the Worker's Paradise. And it grieved him that so many hardened their hearts against him. But he would not force anyone into the Worker's Paradise against their wishes, because he respected their free will.       So if they didn't want to go to the Gulag, they should have just opened their hearts to the love of Stalin and stoped resisting him.         Christians, does this help you understand why Stalin's perfect love is misunderstood?

What I mean to ask is, if it does have different sects then do you consider them man made or Chritianity itself is divided that way? Also, do you follow any other book other than the bible?

20090227090917AAbsdki	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why are christians the first to wave an american patriot banner, but also the first to trample on america?	they trample on america because they look to undermine one of the very things that we based this country on- that is not having a "national" religion, and not having the govenrment entangled with religion.      in fact the founders felt it so important that the VERY FIRST WORDS of the first amendment read "congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free excercise thereof".   not to mention subsequent rulings by the US supreme court that further clarify this.      why is it that christians can't seem to respect that christianity is not "america" and they always seem to be the ones trying to make "christian" doctrines american law.

20090307121512AASsIFk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If the soul enters the body at conception, what will heaven be like?	Since over half of all conceptions spontaneously terminate, for every two people on the planet there are three souls who were never born, roughly. That means just for the people alive today there are about nine billion souls that were never born and are presumably going to heaven. If we use a very generous estimate, maybe two billion people alive today are going to heaven. So the unborn will outnumber the born by about four or five to one.      Even assuming that they will not be embryos in heaven, doesn't that still make heaven seem like a very strange place?

They shall say to the elders, 'This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a profligate and a drunkard.' Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death."      I know Christians don't think it applies any more, but don't you think it's still messed up that it was God's law for thousands of years?

20090307123051AAqz1a6	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	This is a question for all the atheist out there?	first though because i cant answer any more questions today   God allows evil and suffering to exist because he is a loving and fair God,he wants to give those who are evil a chance to repent and be saved from what is to come after they die if they do not receive His free gift,and if he only allowed those who loved him to exist then he wouldn't be fair and he wants to know that we love Him so He give us a choice to love Him or not and He gives us a choice to believe in Him or not. if He took all evil and suffering out of the world people would still not believe and others still would. so if God does not exist then give me the answer to where we all came frome and dont tell me it was by chance because that is impossible and if we came frome apes apes would still be turning into humans so tell me something logical with you brilliant minds.

I know it's just semantics, and it's not an important issue. Was just curious if the term moderate bothered you.

If you watched the California Supreme Court Hearing on Prop 8: You would have heard the judges listed a possible remedy to this situation by declaring "getting out of the marriage business" and instead transferring all marriages and future marriages into Domestic Partnerships!      Fact:   Certain states do not recognize domestic partnership regardless of the sex of the parties involved! However, all states across the board recognize marriage between a man and woman regardless of where the state the marriage was performed in!      So if California “got out of the marriage business” and transferred all previous marriages and future marriages into domestic partnerships, would those domestic partnerships be recognized in other states? Meaning if you had a marriage/ now domestic partnership in CA, then moved to Nevada would your domestic partnership be recognized or would you have to get married there?

About 2 years ago she relapsed into a terrible drug addiction. I went to a male friend for help and ended up getting emotionally involved with him. I never kissed him or had sex or anything, I just became very needy and clingy with him because of my problems at home. My girlfriend and I decided to work on the issues and we got back together.        Now, its like we have issues with truly forgiving each other. Whenever something new comes up, its like all the past hurts keep coming up along with it. Whenever I try to talk to her about my trust issues she brings up the fact I was a ****.  This does nothing to reassure me that I can trust her again.      She lied to me so much and did many bad things like stealing from me and my daughter when she was using drugs.  Even my poor little Chihuahua went to a drug dealer. I was traumatized. I don't mean to justify my actions, but I was scared and heartbroken with what she did and I was only reacting. I was only using that man in order to feel safe.

20090307162453AAkuAY1	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	What does your favorite color say about you?	"According to Dr. Lüscher, your favorite color represents something that you are turning toward, or your preferred method of achieving. The last two colors you choose, your least favorites, represent needs which are repressed. The lower you rank the primary colors, which represent psychological needs, the more indication exists of psychological or physiological problems.      The general characteristic of each color follows.      *Blue represents tranquility, tenderness, sensitivity, love and affection.      *Green represents persistence, self-esteem, possessiveness and obstinacy.      *Red represents desire, domination, sexuality and aggression.      *Yellow represents spontaneity, originality, expectancy and exhilaration.      *Violet represents a search for reality in thoughts and desires.      *Brown represents bodily senses relating to physical and mental comfort.      *Black represents ultimate renunciation and expression of nothingness.      *Grey represents refusal to be involved or to reveal things."    http://www.lifescript.com/Soul/Self/Grow...

Why did he use two different terms to describe himself?   What did he mean by the Son of Man?   We all believe we understand what he meant by the Son of God.   Was he always referring to himself only with either term or both?   Please explain as simply & clearly as possible.   I am curious about the difference & the meaning as well as how you understand it.   Thank You for answering.   Blessings!

We got along great (chemistry was there). I drink, but only in moderation (never gotten drunk) and he said that is very respectable and asked if my parents are strict like his. When I said yes, he asked if I was Catholic. I told him my dad is, but I'm the religion of my mom: Jehovah's Witness. He gave me a weird look and said, "Oh, so you DON"T celebrate your birthday?" (It was my bday the day b/f and he wished me happy b-day). The thing is I am not as devout as I should be and am still learning about the religion. So, why are people so scared to date JW? If i'm willing to try, why aren't they. I won't make them be a JW!

My friend and I found a recent experience in a café unpleasant - the manager (who was serving us) was rude, ignorant and condescending towards us. My friend sent in a letter of complaint and we expected the response to be the customary, "Sorry to hear of your experience, the person in question has been reminded of company policy."      Instead, the company sent my friend a reply, informing us that they take customer feedback very seriously and that the manager in question is to be re-interviewed and re-trained, culminating in an assessment which, if she fails, will result in her being demoted.      Should we feel guilty for this?
20090307161023AAihrKS	Society & Culture;Etiquette	WOMEN: How do you handle guys on line who flake out on you?	Ok, we chatted about 9 months ago for about a week and a half. I explained to him that I would prefer to meet in public BEFORE anything else. He 'said' he was ok with this. Well, a week later... he pretty much fell off the side of the Earth! I'd be on line and see him log off and he didn't email me any more....      Flash forward to two weeks ago... I joined a dating site a and this person pops up, he had the same name as the other guy, but I didn't give it any thought. Well, he gave me his yahoo messenger contact info and I messaged. He messaged me back and low and behold, IT'S THAT GUY! Well, of course, I am saying, in my head, "What the hell? Doesn't he know I'm that woman he totally forgot about??" (My pic is on my yahoo messager and at the dating site...)      Well, the next time I am on Yahoo Messanger, he pops up and says hey. So, I explained to him how I didn't realize he was the same guy from eight months ago. At that point I had NOTHING more to say to him. I feel he had his shot! So, I pretty much told him I was busy and I logged off. (I didn't really feel like getting into the whole thing with him. I've done that in the past and guys just argue with you about how busy they got...I am done with the crap excuses...)  I can't stand flaky people no matter what the conditions. If I am not interested in someone, I let them know right away. I communicate. I don't just stop communicating...       For those of you chatting on line and attempting on line dating, how do you handle these kinds of situations? Have you ever had these kinds of situations....?
20090307165344AAXeAqk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What brings about such hatred and anger?	I won't post who, because I don't want this person to get negative publicity (which I'm sure is this person's motive, to get any attention at all). But, what I saw in that avatar was hurtful to the memory of a wonderful person who touched so many lives, and the beloved person died last year.      What I am trying to understand is, why would anyone have such hatred for a person, that they have to disrespect the memory of a well loved person and celebrate their death. From what we know of the person that died, she even was kind to that hateful person (and we have our guess on who the hateful person is).    But it brings me to the larger question...   I also see people who get angry and then post something to egg on those they disagree with, in the "cat kicking world" mentality.      What is it within people, both Christian, atheist, and other faiths, that brings about such a dark personality? That they love hurting others? I've seen it from all religions and lack of religions.       And, what can be done to finally get through to these people, that hurting others is not the answer?       I'm sorry that this person who has that avatar feels that need to make someone else feel small to feel better about themselves, but why hurt others?
20090307165844AA9NmUu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Has the Vatican excommunicated the rapist step-father of the 9 year old Brazilian girl?	If not, why not?      He's just as guilty for her abortion as it was his actions that even welcomed an abortion!      I just perused the Catechism and was shocked to find that sexual misconduct is not in the list of "personal grave sins".      Where is the church's priorities? Does she not care about consistency? Does the step-father's sin not fall under paragraph 1868 of the Catechism?      And of all the people in the world participating in abortions, the church decides to make a point with a Mother and a Doctor who are protecting a 9 YEAR OLD GIRL from the very real probability of a complicated pregnancy!?      I have never been more ashamed to consider myself a Catholic.

Do you happen to know where people go specifically in Allahabad when it is held there??? Do many people come from outside of India to this pilgramadge???

I have very curly hair and it's been difficult finding someone who can cut it right, so I'm very happy I've found her. The problem is, she styles it all wrong after the cut and I always end up having to go home and re-do it. I like to put gel in my hair when it is wet, scrunch it, and then air dry it. She insists on trying to diffuse my hair or straighten my hair or blow-dry it first and then put gel in it. I've tried telling her to just let it go, that I don't have time, and I've even told her what I normally do to my hair. She just does not get it. She gives me a funny look and then breaks out the diffuser! Diffusers do not work with my hair. I don't know why, but they just don't. I've told her this. I always end up leaving the salon looking like a frizzy mess or a drowned rat. The cut is great! It's just the styling. What should I do? Would it be rude to ask her to let me style it myself?

Whatever dumb people say, I know Egyptians were light-skinned black people...but why do we never hear about other African civilizations? Is it because of slavery?? I hear all those stories about Ancient Rome, Ancient Asia, but the culture I hear the least about is Ancient Africa!
20090307165255AA1Bd4n	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do people think Egyptians weren't black?	For one, why are people trying to dispute the geography? Slaves were brought from Egypt, so how is Egypt going to be a all-white country??   For two, how would Egypt be all white if its in Africa?   For  three, I bet the only reason they don't act like other countries in Africa weren't white is because they can't find the history. If they could, we'd be hearing how their were a white king in some other ancient African country. *You don't see us saying that Elizabeth I of England was black or that the Trojans were black.

Well I had gotten no training when I first started. I did not know what I was doing for a while. I got trained 15 minutes at the cash register the first day and was on my own the rest of the time.I did not know what we sold or how much it costed or anything. I wasnt exactly concentrated becuase I sold ciggerettes to a minor and did not even know that was illegal. I got in trobule and thank god becuase I was 17 it did not go in my criminal record. Now im 18 and im a senior in high school and its close to summer and I really need money and a job. I am not sure if I should do it becuase I dont want anything like that happening again. I want to put full concentration to my job. At school I take all electives so it wouldnt matter If i ended up failing them, I will still graduate.I had the option of not coming to school this year becuase I completed all graduation requirments but I decided to come anyways to make sure I get the entire high school experience. I really need money and want to start college next fall successfully and will not be working while im in college.I think i should find a job now becuase once the summer starts No one is hiring anymore, and it's already so hard to find a job, but I dont know if I can take that much stress. Should I go back to work? Or just finish up with High schol?

20090307161220AAIQBaM	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I need to know how to ask someone if i can hang out with them!?	ok. so we're both 13 and its the end of the grade 7 year, and i'm hanging out with these weird people that have nothing in common with me. the reason i was hanging out with them was because my best friend moved to a private school and i needed to hang out with someone until the end of elementary. when my best friend moved schools, i hung out with this really unpopular girl for about a week when my ex--friends (they are popular) asked me to be apart of their clique. i said "no" back then, because i was OK with this other girl. now i'm stuck with these really immature, hyper, weird girls and i'm nothing like them. the other girl "gang" has recently been really nice to me, and i'm thinking of becoming friends with them again. they are in different classes, so i can only be with them after school and at free time. the problem is, i really don't want to screw this up. i'm not going to use them like i did the other "friends", because i have lots in common with them. i just don't want to sound totally desperate when asking. what do i say to ask?   ps. i'm sorry...its kinda long!

In the Italian variation of Cinderella, called Centratolla the heroine's name is Zezolla. However like many other Cinderella stories the wicked step mother gives the heroine a demeaning nickname. In Zelzolla's case she becomes Centratolla. Why is this? What makes Centratolla a more demeaning name than Zezolla?   Here is an exerpt from the story:   "For five or six days the new stepmother overwhelmed Zezolla with caresses, seating her at the best place at table, giving her the choicest morsels to eat, and clothing her in the richest apparel. But ere long) forgetting entirely the good service she had received, (woe to him who has a bad master!) she began to bring forward six daughters of her own, whom she had until then kept concealed; and she praised them so much, and talked her husband over in such a manner, that at last the stepdaughters engrossed all his favor, and the thought of his own child went entirely from his heart: in short, it fared so ill with the poor girl, bad today and worse tomorrow, that she was at last brought down from the royal chamber to the kitchen, from the canopy of state to the hearth, from splendid apparel of silks and gold to dishclouts, from the scepter to the spit. And not only was her condition changed, but even her name; for instead of Zezolla, she was now called Cenerentola."

We have a family friend (a girl, 14) who has been expressing concern to us over her Confirmation.  Her family is Catholic, but she does not consider herself Catholic and is extremely uncomfortable with this being forced on her.  For the weeks leading up to today's Confirmation, she kept telling us she didn't want to do it, but was afraid to tell her parents for fear of punishment.  Her Confirmation was today and she was crying the entire time before the ceremony, felt scared by the priest and her family and went through with it even though she keeps saying she didn't want to.  I am not familiar with the Catholic faith (was raised Southern Baptist) so I wanted to know if this girl could have denied her confirmation, and what the consequences would have been?  She feels horrible now and does not want to live with this decision - she didn't want to do it.

20090307164051AAP3Fwq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does Jesus really say that he is Lucifer/Satan?!!?	Please do not ignore this because I am searching for a logical, studied answer, and I cannot get this from any forum, etc.   The least that you could do is to kindly point me in the right direction for my search.      I hope to understand why exactly Jesus is referring to Himself as Satan…  Well, I have my theories, i.e. the Christian trinity and the Hindu Brahman trinity are symmetrical, and if so, that would mean most religions are peers.    First,  Revelation 22:16 (KJV) I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.    Now, looking back at:    Isaiah 14:12 (KJV) How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the nations!    Which Jesus is the only one in the whole Bible to equate to Satan in:    Luke 10:18 (KJV) And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.     Now, if you are to actually look at what Lucifer means: it is a translation of the Hebrew Heylel:    H-1966. heylel,   hay-lale';     from H-1984 (in the sense of brightness); the morning-star:--lucifer.       .... H-1984. halal,   haw-lal';     a prim. root; to be clear (orig. of sound, but usually of color); to shine; hence to make a show, to boast; and thus to be (clamorously) foolish; to rave; causat. to celebrate; also to stultify:--(make) boast (self), celebrate, commend, (deal, make), fool (-ish, -ly), glory, give [light], be (make, feign self) mad (against), give in marriage, [sing, be worthy of] praise, rage, renowned, shine      Now, I wish to listen to your opinion of why this is.  So far I have only heard “No, it cannot be.  Those are two different writers, etc. etc.”  In a book inspired by God when the writer of Revelation clearly states in two different and differing terms the exact meaning of Heylel, i.e. bright AND morning star, or the literal meaning of Lucifer/Heylel.   I have really only studied the King James version of the Bible because it was the only thing around for over 200 years, neh?  Nowadays, versions are springing up like morning flowers.  But the question of the matter is not the Bible, it is the wording…  The Hebrew word is still the same, and so is the Greek translation of it, and if you cannot equate the meaning of a word with the word in the other language.  How can you translate?   P(ost)S(oulsearch):  I am not trying to sway anybody, or anything of the sort.  I am merely trying to understand why I see what I see.  Please actually consider what I am saying.  So far, everyone refuses to.  It is common sense, and so it must have been elaborated on before.  Yet, I am not that read in theological works.  Could you please point me in the right direction because this is big, and yet no one has yet to even get close to explaining it.  I mean, when you trasnslate a word, but you do not want to use the exact translation word, i.e. King James translators did not wish to state that Jesus is saying that He, Himself is Lucifer, and so they just put in the exact meaning of Lucifer/Heylel, i.e. the bright and morning star, see Strong's Concordance Hebrew 1966.

20090307173434AAdrjhA	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why dont you think you are better than other people?	a follow on question to my last question (do you think you are better than other people)  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       its all hypothetical ofcourse, but....      if people dont feel as though they are better than other people, then are they not in some ways, are they not lieing? Are they not saying that they dont think much of what they have achieved with their life.      My rational is that we build a life that we think is good. We work hard at it because things that are easy to get are rarely worth having. It takes time, blood, sweat, tears and a healthy dollop of luck. Thus i find it hard to accept that people dont think better of themselves when they compare themselves to a drifter who chanced their way through life, sponging off the system, uneducated, poor, lazy, bad attitude or is violent.....whatever bad virtues you can have (yes poor and uneducated is one of them, thats lazyness to an extent, and i dont mean megabucks, i mean 'not in poverty'...."being born poor isnt your fault, but dieing poor is" - Bill Gates)

They really get my blood boiling.not just colour but all this stuff against immigrants n religion etc.Ive found myself getting into dumb posting arguments with idiots I don't even know cos they post stupid scare stories that they cant even back up with facts.kids read stuff n some might even get sucked in with it.The thing that gets me the most is that when you go to almost any country their are people from THEIR country that had to put up with the same trash that their spreading.Its the21st century!Im proud to be Irish but im not so insecure to think my culture is going to be damaged or watered down.That's up to the native people to carry on those traditions.when I was in dublin there was Sudanese guys living next to us for a couple of years and they were some of the most decent people Ive ever met,they had a different culture but went out of their way to make us welcome n them n us'Irish'lads got along just grand.Id like to think it taught me to judge people on who they are,not what people tell me they are.Should I just leave these people to it cos I don't think its doing nothing but getting me more angry?Its like havin an argument with a brick wall,n Im usually fairly laid back but this stuff just gets me raised

20090307173137AAEF8K1	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why does he like to talk to me sometime and other times he doesn't like to talk?	I've got a new crush on a guy I've known sense the beginning of the school year but I didn't really notice him that way until recently.       I'm not open about being bi; only like 2 other people know. I'm a dude btw.       Anyway; he's kind of muscular. Today he had on a "wife beater" and i was like "man your like extra muscular! nice; i'm jealous" *insert flirty smile* lol. And then he flexes and goes "It's not much" and of course he's got the ego smile goin and I jokingly tell him to shut up because if his muscles are rocks mine are pebbles. Lol. Sometimes he stands really close to me. We were sitting in class and I let my foot touch his and he didn't move it even when I tapped at it a little. I said "I'm thinking about trying to dress like him since he pulls it off" and he smiled and said maybe he'd try to dress like me he thinks he can pull it off. So that's good I guess. So I try to do little flirts like that and he responds well but sometimes he just acts like he doesn't want to talk to me and other times he'll laugh at my corny jokes and he'll be really friendly.      So I don't know why he wants to talk to me and then two minutes later he doesn't want to. And I was talking to one of my best friends who's a handsome guy and his demeanor changed when he saw us talking; he kind of went into a shell. And I spend a lot of time with my best friend because I've known him for years he's really cool and we get along well so yeah. Idk what to do.      This isn't the first time this has happened to me with someone I like so maybe it's something I'm doing.

Every single time I genuinely like someone I would always feel like I'm not good enough for them even though I KNOW they like me back!  I would sometimes even complain and asked myself WHAT DO THEY SEE IN ME?!      I don't get it, they are times when I feel like I can have anybody I want but then when they do start liking me I push them away because I feel like they deserve someone better than me!! I've done this so many times!!  Like this one girl I liked her a lot but then I told her she should go with the guy that likes her because hes the most popular guy in school even though she already told me she liked me.. and then I moved on and started liking this guy but then pushed him to asked another girl out because she seemed to really like him (Their best friends and I could sense the girl was crushing on him) even though I was making real connection with this guy!!      I don't know why thinking of being in a relationship freaks me out so much!!  I feel like I won't be a good girlfriend or won't make them happy!!!  I'm 16 years old and only had one boyfriend and broke up with him for the same reason! I FELT LIKE HE DESERVED SOMEONE BETTER THAN ME!!  I'm openly bisexual and I got a lot of girls all up on me and I like a couple of girls but I don't want to be in a relationship with any of them!! same thing with guys!       I don't think it's self-steem issues cause I'm pretty confident and don't really care what other people think.. or maybe it is because when I was a kid I remember my mom and dad comparing me to my cousins how special and smart they are that I should be more like them!  And when I was 13 I remember arguing with my dad and he told me I was a pain in the ***!!    How can I stop feeling this way? It hurts to feel like I'm not good enough for someone!
