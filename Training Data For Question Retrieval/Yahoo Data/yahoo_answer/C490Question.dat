My boyfriend is allergic to the elastic in his underwear - He breaks out  in a ring of hives all around his waist where the elastic is sitting. It is the right size for him (not that he's large around the wasit or anything) and he's tried a size up to see if it was due to constriction of the skin. No relief. It doesn't seem to be a latex allergy as he has no reaction to latex gloves or balloons or latex condoms. I hate to see him miserable, and the welts from the hives freak me out. I break out in hives from stress so I know how miserable it is.      Any of you men out there have this problem? What brands have given you relief?

Now I am in perfect shape and want to stop the diet but a few days ago I read an article that said that if you eat 2500 kcal daily and you cut them to 2000 kcal then you get slim but after a while your body adapts to the new diet and is ok with the 2000 kcal a day and if you go back to the 2500 kcal diet you will be gaining weight as you body will only need 2000 kcal for the day.

Ho questo problema: la prima volta che ho fatto l'amore io ero sotto e lui sopra, e mi ha fatto molto male, l'ho fermato più di una volta, prima di riuscire a penetrare completamente ha provato ad entrare altre 4 volte ma non riusciva perchè mi faceva male. Ieri sera era la seconda volta, e anche se prima di farlo aveva toccato parecchio, mi ha fatto male di nuovo infatti alla 3 prova gli ho chiesto di uscire. Poi mi ha proposto di provare da dietro, cioè in posizione io a pancia sotto, e lo abbiamo fatto cosi, ma anche cosi a dire il vero mi ha fatto male, specie nei movimenti. insomma sono 2 volte e 2 volte su 2 mi ha fatto malissimo. cosa mi consigliate di fare? ci sono posizioni più "comode" così magari riesco anche a farlo, sennò ho paura che si stanchi di fare queste mezze cose cosi. Grazie ciao!!!!

20090202144822AABd6Ty	Health;Mental Health	Is it REALLY possible to live a "normal" life with bipolar disorder?	I see this a lot on yahoo answers and in books - that with treatment, you can live a normal life with bipolar. (Whatever normal is. I'm going to say, you have a job if you want, kids if you want, stable, safe housing, if you want to do something like go on vacation or fix the car, you can do it without having a meltdown and trying to kill yourself). Well, I can't seem to do that (and can't find any treatment to help me) and nobody I have ever heard of or known with bipolar, even those who had helpful meds, could live a "normal" life, so is this REALLY true, or only for people who only have maybe 3 episodes in their life?      People I have known on meds gained over 50 lbs, usualy much more than that, are sleepy all the time, and are disabled from work anyhow. Research I did found that over 60% of people with bipolar are unemployed, and of the 40% who are employed, almost all are part time.  Most of the full time folks take long leaves of absence. This was in a legitimate medical journal.      Anyway, I've been beating myself up for years, why can others live a "normal" life with kids and a good job and few symptoms, and I can't?  I wonder if this is all a lie, because people who write books or answer on yahoo answers don't want to tell the truth, that if you come down with bipolar, you are screwed?      OK, so the question was: Is it REALLY possible to live a "normal" life with bipolar?

Okay, so my bf and I have done oral a few times and each time, he's gotten so "excited" that I've gagged. now I've talked with him about controlling the pumping so that I don't throw up or something, but he keeps doing it. Every time, I start making the ughhh...bleeccc gagging sounds, he just keeps pumping. And, in addition to that, he makes me puff out my cheeks and make pumping sounds. And last time, I had to sprint, vomiting, to the bathroom.  To show him what it's like to gag on c*ck, I was thinking of shoving a cucumber down his throat and if he gags, push it in a little further. What else could I do to show him what its like?

I don't have that job anymore and I can't seem to break that sleeping pattern. It's becoming a real problem because occasionally I'm late to work now. I try to sleep but I always end up getting back up after an hour of laying there and messing on the computer or watching tv or something until I start to feel tired again. I try not to drink or eat anything that might keep me awake but it doesn't help. Any suggestions on what might be able to help get me to sleep or any kind of methods that you guys use when you know you HAVE to be asleep by a certain time or you'll feel tired the next day?       Sorry for the long question :(

20070614110044AAkZ1uW	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Insurance question. Can they do this?	I quit my job and selected Cobra coverage to cover my pregnancy. I am due in 8 weeks and the cobra insurance people are changing my plan from an EPO to a PPO. When I originally signed up with Cobra and asked them what everything would cost, they told me it was covered 100%. (throughout the entire pregnancy I have paid one $5 copay). Now, 2 months before I am due they are changing my plan which means every doctors visit will cost me $20 (which is significant because I have to go every 2 weeks and then in the last month I go once a week). My monthly payments are going up $100 (!!!) and I will have to pay a 10% copay on the delivery costs. Can they just up and change everything like that? It reminds me of when they fire people just before they would have to pay out on pensions.

I am not on any prescription meds, don't drink or smoke eat healthy, am not overweight, etc.  My dad died recently, and i have been really stressed out helping take care of my mom.  yesterday my blood pressure was 146/94. 150/100, 146/98, etc. according to my mom's portable home bp machine (my mom checked hers and it was normal according to the machine).  i do not have hypertension normally.  I went to a dr. (my normal dr. is on vacation) and he prescribed .5 mg of xanax to take twice a day.  he did blood tests but said that he though that everything was most likely normal, that my bp was rising because of stress and possible panic atacks.  my bp at the drs. office was 116/80.  I have been taking the xanax for the past day, but i have read about about it and it is scary to me.  the dr. stressed that i really need it, at least for a little while.  will this be safe to take until next week when i see my actual dr.?  I am hoping that he can prescribe something safer.

20070705194558AAztYXq	Health;Dental	Need help!!!!Any Dentist out there?	I'm 19 years old and have to get my wisdom teeth out. They all will need stiches, three are poking out slightly and one in completly impacted. My dad got his out, the two tops pulled he was fine then my best friend just got hers done today and is feeling horrible. She was knocked out IV and everything. The way I see it I'm going to be numb anyway and I'm fine with needles. I could really care less about vibrations, pushing, sounds and other sensations as long as I can't feel the pain of them comming out. Plus it will be half the cost of going to have an oral surgen do it. I trust my dentist and he's really good. He's not giving me any anethesia just numbing me up and giving me some good pain meds. I would be in pain afterwards if I went to a surgen anyways. Does anyone have experience in doing this in the dentists office? Or any dentist willing to give some advice? You think they could numb me again before I left so it would last longer or is too much novacane bad for you?

20070708185920AARhTEa	Health;Dental	New immediate dentures?	I had 24 teeth extracted on July 2nd and had the immediate dentures placed. I have been really lucky so far, haven't had much pain or discomfort, it's actually going really well and the healing process is moving along on time. Almost all of my swelling is gone and in 6-8 weeks I get my soft liners. I do have one huge question though so far. I don't want to seem a fool asking the dentist because I have brought it up and they seem to blow me off saying it's just the swelling. But is it perfectly normal for your upper lip to seem to stick out further than it should? My smile seems so fake and disfigured because of it. Like I said my face swelling is all gone but could it be swelling from the gums still since they have stitches in them? I just don't want this "fake"look to stay. It's almost like the upper denture is pushing my top lip out. Has anyone else gone through this and/or know if it will look right when it's all said and done? I am very nervous about it. Thank you.
20070709183238AAtYGbo	Health;Dental	Dental opinion?	My dentists says that a crown he put in about 10 years ago is a little loose and that he wants to investigate by pulling it off.   Does not seem loose to me, but I don't want to force it.   He indicated that worse case he may have to extract tooth or replace crown ($1000+, insurance may only pay half).  Tooth has never caused me any problems since crown was put on.      To anyone with dental expertise, what is my recommended course of action?  Should I start a process which could result in a extraction of a tooth which is not causing me problems?  Or spend alot of money on a crown replacement.  If tooth is extracted, then what?      I am somewhat concerned that he may be "drill prone".  For example, I still have my wisdom teeth in (I'm 47).  My former dentist recommended doing nothing because they have never caused me problems.  My current dentist suggests that I have them removed, which I have resisted.  Why undergo expensive, painful dental surgery for something that causes no pain?

20070714231152AAclYKr	Health;Dental	How long does it take for a cavity to form?	I went to my regular dentist on December 2006 for a cleaning and he didn't find any cavities at that time. Then, I got braces on January. I moved to another state and it was time for my 6 months check-up and cleaning again. So I went to do it a couples of days ago and the doctor told me that I have 6 teeth that have cavities. But when the hygine doctor was doing the cleaning, she told me that I was taking good care of my teeth. So I don't understand if I am brushing my teeth 3 times a day, avoiding candy and soda; why I ended up having cavities? And the weird thing is that the doctor didn't show me my x-rays or the teeth that have cavities. The only thing he told me was, "we need to take care of those cavities right away!" So now I am divating on going for a second opinion because I don't believe this doctor. Please let me know if you have any suggestion or comments.

Ok.. well a couple years ago whenever i get made at my friends for making fun of my (joking of course), I like 'clawed' their arms which made 'nail indents' on there skin. After a while, I agreed to stop doing that, so with everyone agreeing, I had to 'claw' myself as to get even with me hurting everyone else. But instead, I more of scratched my arm which caused it to bleed and burn in pain. -That sadly left a scar on my left arm.   Then about a year and a half later, when I got seriously mad at my friends (I get mad easily), I scratched myself again, same arm and another scar. Around this point I wasn't shy anymore.   Then in sixth grade, I used my mechanical pencil and scratched myself with it because I got mad at a classmate who 'licked' my art eraser which my dad got me as a gift for good grades. -he gave it to me since I like to draw.

Guardando bene allo specchio, dopo aver notato un colore grigio dello smalto (per necrosi?) sempre piu' evidente, ho scoperto di avere il dente del giudizio semi-incluso cariato. La carie nera (e non grigia) e' sotto la gengiva, ma non vicino all'altro molare che mi sembra sano. E' proprio questo il punto. E' sano? Come faccio a capirlo prima di andare dal dentista (ho gia' preso l'appuntamento)? Per il dente del giudizio non c'e' piu' nulla da fare, va sicuramente tolto, ma mi scoccerebbe sapere che il vicino ha risentito non della carie "lontana", ma del "grigio" vicino..A toccarlo il molare vicino non mi fa male. In generale, la necrosi di un dente A puo' causare la carie del dente vicino B, anche se la carie di A e' "lontana" da B ?

I get   compliments on it all the time. You cant tell I have an overbite   unless i open my mouth wide and say Cheese! They said I'd   get surgery and they'd break my jaw, and re-build it. Its very   painful and I'd have to be hospitalized. Since it doesnt bother   me or keep me from smiling, I dont really need it. Its more of   a cosmetic thing, however, i wanted to have a straight bite. What do you think I should do? Help!

On one tooth, I can feel the bottom of it, which is how bad it's going away. I know I need to see a dentist eventually, but right now I cannot afford it. Are there any store bought products I can use to help with gum sensitivity? Any suggestions what to do (besides see the dentist)? Thank you.

20090111232217AAHUpLG	Health;Dental	How long should a dentist wait before he starts to drill?	I went to the dentist the other day to fix a chipped molar.  He gave me 2 shots of what I think was Novocaine, and started drilling 5 minutes later. I had to stop him right away because I could feel everything.  He gave me another shot, didn't wait, and started drilling again.  I could still feel the pain, and I stopped him again. He gave me one more shot, and I was finally numb to the point sounding Sylvester the Cat  hours later.  My question is, if he would have waited a little bit longer do you think I could have forgone the last two shots.  By the way, the inside of my mouth is still in pain with sores all by his work.  Not to mention the inlay they did 6 months ago has to be replaced because it is more painful than when I didn't have the inlay placed.        6 months ago was my first root canal, and the chipped tooth was from the only filing I got 16 years ago.  I have never had any dental problems until 6 months ago. The inlay on the left side of my mouth had a root canal and it's still hurts when I chew or even brush over it with my toothbrush, and my gums where the inlay was placed are almost raw.  What could be causing all this pain.      Only those who have some kind of experience in dentistry please reply.  Please no obvious advice like "Call 1800dentist".  Thanks for reading.  I'm gonna go and puree a late night snack.
