People are friendly and family-oriented, unless you live in a college town(Morgantown & Huntington).

PA0bGBtCaa	I just flew from Houston to Nashville a few hours ago. It was 80 in Houston and it's 20 right now in Nashville. So anticipating the change in temperature, I just wore my winter clothes in Houston so I didn't have to worry about packing clothes in my carry-on. I just put my jacket in my luggage for when I landed.<br>  <br>  So for you, I'd recommend just wearing a short sleeved shirt, some comfy pants, and shoes. Yeah it'll be nippy until you get into the terminal where it's room temp, and then it will be warm on the plane. So really, you won't need the winter attire for too long.|`|3UB7mSNwaa	wear you Boston coat when you leave and take a lighter jacket in your luggage for FLorida.  you will need you boston jacket when you return to boston.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	I wore shorts and a hoodie from Baltimore to Miami, and I wasn't cold.|`|vITZgKthaa	were a some coat and after take it off when you arrive<br>  <br>  it always helps me|`|PSiNv7gUaa	I flew to Florida when it was about 40 degrees in Missouri.

The next time my skin touched air was in Florida, and I was perfectly comfortable with what I was wearing.

Plus you can accumulate all the frequent flier miles you get to go on an actual non-work related travel vacation. The only down side is that it can be a pretty stressful job at times. There are weeks where you can work 60-70 hours, others where you work 20 max. By the way the pay is really good, can be in 6 figures.

Homecoming dances are held in fall on the weekend of big rival football games and welcome alumni and current sports types mainly in October. Some schools have a mid-winter dance held in late January or early February that will carry a local favorite theme whether it be Sadie Hawkins or Snow Ball and the like.

I highly doubt that you could tell someone all of the countries that are compiled to create the UK, since you're more than likely American.

Because it is our nature to drink coffee, the west coast is a pretty laid back part of the country, if we did not consume caffine we would be like the walking dead.    So, we drink it to remember how it is to be alive.  But, you know what?    People have stopped buying coffee here.  Lots of places around town are going out of business.

However a week before the flight, all of those fares are long gone. If you manage to get anywhere under $100, I'd be suprised.    Save your money. By the time you get to the airport, fly, and get out of the airport, you won't have any time to enjoy your destination before you have to go right back to the airport.|`|SNllynBiaa	I doubt you fly anywhere with only $100. If all you have is $100 I think you need to think of something else to do besides fly somewhere almost broke.|`|mimykKnhaa	That would depend on where you live, as closer flights will be cheaper.

It is such a large distance and will take over 4hours by plane. It is also not the best terrain to be traveling through by road.     If you were interested in going to Darwin or Adelaide, there is a train that runs to Alice Springs from both cities. The Ghan. It would be worth doing, other wise just fly from Sydney.     Cost wise, it will cost you much the same to be honest. You should be able to get airfares for around $250.|`|b1b9e01a3a97d3b341b8824489d9e2fbaa	Unless you particularly want to see other parts of Australia, plane will be the cheapest way to get from Sydney to Alice Springs. I did a quick check, and saw plane fares from about $250 one way, and the bus at $400+ one way.    Also, the plane trip will be a bit over 4 hours, as opposed to 40+ hours on the bus (including the times waiting for transfers). Trains are even more expensive and slower than the bus, but generally let you travel in a bit more luxury.

b1znvwnJaa	Maddame Tussaud is famous for its state of the art wax! Here you can come and meet all your favourite movie stars and even the artistocracy!     The Globe Theater is fantastic for seeing Shakespeare in action. Romeo and Juliet or Hamlet? It is up to you!    The Tower bridge is London's best attractions. The beautiful scenes are breathtaking and perhaps, you would like to go for a cruise afterwards in the banks of the River Thames!    Are you in for a little fright? Well, then come to the London dungeon! Ghosts...monsters and mutilated bodies... scary doesn't get better than that! Make sure you are twelve and over though, you don't want to scare the little ones silly!    I haven't been to the South Bank Complex before...   perhaps, you could say something about the music festivals and the work inside and outside the three iconic buildings, Royal Festival Hall, Queen Elizabeth Hall and The Hayward.    Maybe, you should change it slightly, otherwise your teacher may be suspicious!    Good Luck.

lys5kB9Daa	well i grew up in a small town in massachusetts but i was so sick of the snow that i moved to phoenix. i learned i really liked mass, the town was so small and quant like everybody pretty much knew everybody and i always felt safe and i love the style of houses and big yards, but as much as i love all that i just really could never go back there and freeze my butt of for 7 months and shovel snow. not worth it! but phoenix is not a great place, its too dam hot and its not very safe. a friend of mine from mass has been living in jacksonville, florida for years and he loves it, so i might move there. you could check that out, or i'm also looking at small town in south texas.|`|8ss15aSOaa	I think you'll find an area you're looking for about 20 min outside of just about every major city in the U.S.  For example, the burbs around Cleveland, OH are very safe, offer just about every store/restaurant you can imagine, and are only 20 min outside of the city.  The city itself is mid sized and traffic is fine, even during rush hour.  The cost of living is REALLY low compared to other areas and there are tons of awesome deals to be had on bank owned/foreclosed properties.  On the downside, the winters here are very cold and snowy.

Trains, buses & trams to pretty much everywhere you want to go in the city  Very multi cultural and quite laid back. Not as fast paced as Sydney but still has that big city feel.  Warm weather but not as hot as Queensland.  I paid $110 - $150 per week for rent in St Kilda when i was there. I was right next to either a train station or tram stop each time.

AA11496012	I don't know of any budget airlines that fly to Washington DC from Asia.  You can see how much a ticket costs on United Airlines.  The flight will depart Singapore and will either take you to Hong Kong or Tokyo.  Then you fly to Chicago and then onto Washington DC.  Since you are flying around the end of November, the ticket prices should not be too bad.  Once you get closer to Christmas, the ticket prices may go up.  Since the trip isn't for awhile, no need to rush.  Just keep your eyes open for a lower fare and if you see something within your budget, then purchase.  I would say buy your ticket at least 1 month before you leave.|`|v3gTAo3raa	You can definitely get much cheaper flights than that.

I am not sure why, but their biological parent/s don't usually want them to be adopted to some strangers, and the children end up staying at the orphanage until they become older and support themselves somehow.  It is very, very hard to find a baby to adopt, but you may have a 'miracle' chance to adopt an older child, if you are very patient.|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	It's hard in Japan, it's not like Korea or China where they basically throw out their kids for anyone to adopt (it sounds harsh).<br>  <br>  But Japanese people would have the first priority to adopt in Japan.<br>  <br>  I suggest if you just want an Asian kid, try Korea or China.  China would be easier to get a girl since most parents want a boy and give up a daughter in a heart beat. <br>  <br>  China is nothing like what you hear.

AA10740352	You can get cash at the casino cage (change window) by just showing your cruise card.  You don't have to get chips to cash in they give you cash; I have done it several times. The limit for your cruise is usually up to about $2,000. and they will charge a fee of about 3% of the amount that you get.  So if you get $100 the fee is $3.00.  It can get expensive if you want a lot of money (i.e., $500 would cost you $15.)  The funds that you obtain this way are added to your on-board charges that you will pay by credit card or cash at the end of the cruise.<br>  <br>  The cruise ship will have an ATM and there will also likely be ATM in the port stops that you make but both will charge fees and then so will your bank on each transaction.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Yes you can get a cash advance on credit card but those rates are 25% and up   Use the ATM|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	There is always a fee for obtaining cash except for one condition.

xIHgTqVhaa	I'm a former Flight Attendant and I fly a lot with my three children. <br>  <br>  With little ones, less is more. What does he like at home? Often simple toys work the best. <br>  <br>  Not all of these tips are mine but some have worked for me as well;<br>  -Something to write and draw on. My kids like those small Magadoodles and other erasable boards. Paper and chunky crayons work too. <br>  -Stickers. Always a winner and with so many age groups.<br>  -Pipe cleaners, although you want to keep an eye on him while he's twisting away.<br>  -Play dough. Don't bring too much and don't make my mistake. Take fresh play dough. I had some sitting on the shelf a bit too long (saved especially for a flight) and we had crumpled bits all over the floor! <br>  -Books, chunky books and those with flaps are especially appreciated.<br>  -Small plastic toys, things with wheels work well but anything without too many small parts.<br>  <br>  No toys which make *any* noise. Not even a little, quiet noise. Played over and over and over again, your fellow passengers will not appreciate it. <br>  <br>  Bring at least one new thing she has never seen before. Give it to her at some point when she's bored. Works like magic. If it's a long flight, you may want to bring more than one. <br>  <br>  I have a portable DVD player but only got it once my youngest was three years old. This is a great suggestion for older kids but the problem at this tender age is that they wont wear the headphones. You cannot play it through the speakers on the aircraft (unless there's no one else in your entire section). If you are connecting and have a long layover, it might be worth taking it for your wait.<br>  <br>  If you already have one (don't buy one unless you have other ideas for it), experiment at home. Will she wear the headphones? Or will she watch it without sound? Either will work but it is a heavy item to drag along, if you're not sure it'll earn it's place in your carry-on bag. If you do, make sure you also have the recharger (in case of delays). <br>  <br>  I do have to admit that the babies on flights who had their car seats were calmer and slept better. This is also much, much safer than having her in your lap and guarentees your car seat, if you need it at your destination, doesn't get lost and/or broken in the hold. Ask nicely for an extra seat if you didn't purchase one. <br>  <br>  Just some other small tips;<br>  -Bring a change of clothes<br>  -Bring way more diapers than you think you'll need<br>  -Learn to change her standing up (don't try to fit her on one of those tiny babychangers and toddlers hate to lie down in strange places)<br>  -Wean her off the bottle if she's still drinking from one (easier said than done!)<br>  -Bring an empty sippy cup to fill during the services. This will prevent spills in the air.<br>  -Get up and move around with her but keep an eye out. Those carts the F/A's use are the perfect height for hiding little ones<br>  -Bring extra socks to put over her hands if she mostly crawls. This will keep her hands clean and keep her from picking up nasties on the floor.<br>  -Bring snacks. Don't fret security. I've never had anything taken away (yes, water but not snacks) and that's the only risk. If you have something not allowed, they simply remove the item. No scenes, no speeches, no arrests!<br>  -Try to sit in a bulkhead seat so that there's no one in front of you<br>  -Bring slippers, especially if you're not in the bulkhead!<br>  <br>  For more information, about 9 years ago I wrote an article on this subject.

Check a goverment website about information on the security and other tips on the countries you'll visit before you go. I use the Australia site www.smartraveller.gov.au .  Try to find a site similar to this for your own country. Also, on the smart traveller site, you can even register your details so If there is a emergency within the country your embassy will contact you straight away. Apart from that, dont wear very much jewelry and try to keep your money hidden as much as possible when shopping. If you walk around with a backpack, make sure you have little locks on it to prevent someone from stealing something. Just be very careful, dont trust most people, especially other men. Most guys would probably be fine but there are others out there that are dangerous, you cant really tell between them until its too late. Dont walk around by yourself at night, well try not to. Make friends with other tourists like you at the hotels, that way you all can go out in group. And always contact your family/friends regulary and even give them a copy of your itinerary and contact numbers to be safe.

OKDydyJFaa	I am currently residing in Vancouver, and like you, I immigrated to canada a couple years ago. You will find that the cost of living in Vancouver is very high, but there are still tons of job opportunities. BC's economy currently stands the strongest in Canada, and it is very unlikely that you would be unemployed for a long time. Homes are probably the peak in terms of cost of living: the average detached home in Vancouver is valued at 600,000 dollars. You can rent a 2 or 3 bed condo in Downtown for about 2000-2300 a month. Vancouver also currently has the most expensive housing market in Canada. In terms of weather, Vancouver is the warmest city in Canada and its winter shouldnt be a problem for you. The temperature is usually between 30F - 50F (0C - 5C) during the winter, so no colder than New York City, Philadelphia or Boston, and 30F being the coldest. It rarely snows, maybe only 3 times a year. However, it does rain A LOT here, and i would reccomend getting some rainjackets and umbrellas. The summer here is awesome, sun until 10pm and 80-100F (25 - 35C) weather. Public transport is incredibly efficient, probably one of the best systems in North America. Buses come by about every 15 minutes, depending where you live, and the skytrain system connects the downtown to the rest of the city. The seabus crosses from downtown to North/West Vancouver in 15 minutes, and you are even allowed to bring bikes aboard. This city is very eco-friendly and the transport is so good, my advice would be to wait on buying a car. So choose VANCOUVER! you'll really find the city beautiful, and u have stuff like skiing 20 minutes from dowtown (Grouse mountain), good night life, and an extremely safe environment. The people are a lot friendlier too, since the weather is warmer I guess. o and dont go to eastern canada... winter is UNBEARABLE, so stick with western canada.

It's almost as if there's the notion that if they can get here, it's such a great place, they'll stay," said Chris Robinson.<br>  <br>  Immigration isn't a permanent phenomenon and Canada needs to approach it as a firm would approach retaining an employee, he said. "We don't want to take it as a given that just because somebody's come here that they're going to stay."<br>  <br>  One-third of young male immigrants leave Canada within 20 years of arriving and more than 60 per cent of those who leave do so in the first year, according to Return and Onward Migration among Working Age Men, a recent Statistics Canada report co-authored by Robinson.<br>  <br>  The report, a study of male immigrants aged 25 to 45 at the time they arrived in Canada, found that over the past two decades business professionals and skilled workers, the most desirable immigrants, are the most likely to leave, with 40 per cent of them leaving the country within 5 years of arrival.<br>  <br>  Because there are no exit interviews when an immigrant leaves Canada, the study made inferences about why they left based on landing records, census data and income tax filings. Immigrants who arrived during poor economic climates (in 1980 and 1990) were more likely to leave than those who arrived during boom times (1986 and 1996). Therefore, it's likely immigrants are leaving for better opportunities elsewhere, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  The best way to keep these immigrants is to ensure they get jobs that match their skills and experiences, said the director of operations at the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council.<br>  <br>  "We know that good employment is the number one indicator of successful integration for immigrants," said Elizabeth McIsaac. "A key element in all this is having employers involved in the development of programs that are intended to bring immigrants into the labour market."<br>  <br>  One such program is Toronto's Career Bridge, a non-profit internship program that matches qualified immigrants with appropriate jobs. Since the program started three years ago, 270 immigrants have found full-time work in their fields, but there are still 1,500 skilled immigrants, more than half with university degrees, on the waiting list. So far only 115 of the city's 2,760 businesses with more than 100 employees have signed up for the program.<br>  <br>  HR professionals need to begin looking at international credentials and education as an asset, said McIsaac. There are tools available to help HR understand international credentials and agencies that can connect employers with immigrants, so employers have no excuse not to consider immigrants for job openings, she said.<br>  <br>  "Once you begin to have more experience working with immigrant communities, it becomes a lot easier and you can do it a lot better," she said.<br>  <br>  If Canadian employers aren't willing to take advantage of these immigrants, the Statistics Canada report proves they'll go elsewhere to find jobs, said Robinson.<br>  <br>  "If a better opportunity comes up somewhere else and it happens to come up across an international border, then they're quite likely to move," he said.<br>  <br>  Over the next 10 years, immigration will represent all of the growth in Canada's workforce because there simply won't be enough young Canadians to replace retiring baby boomers. However, Canada isn't the only country facing a looming labour shortage and other countries that haven't typically gone after immigrants, such as Japan and India, are now doing so, said McIsaac.<br>  <br>  "We are in a global economy and we are competing for a high level of talent in other countries," she said.

AA11524272	Well, the explanation is not simple but I will try to make it short. I really should not generalize but I will have to in order to simply my explanation:<br>  <br>  Many countries in the Middle East kind of "hate" Israel because Israel a nation (or "state") was "created" after World War II and "imposed" by some superpower countries (Britain, France) in land that has historically been regarded as true "arab". Arab countries feel the land where Israel is now located actually belongs to them, including Jerusalem. <br>  <br>  Jerusalem is a city where, for many many MANY centuries different religions have co-existed: jews, christians and muslims mainly. Although they have coexisted for a long, long time, since the "creation" of the state (country) of Israel in 1948 another group of people, the palestinians have declared that the land where Israel is located is really part of "Palestine". Palestine is not yet officially a country, but the palestinians insist Palestine is a country and so it should be acknowledged as such. The problem is, that if Palestine is accepted as a country, Israel would have to concede some things to the Palestinians and so they have been denied such recognition for many years now. So, in consequence, SOME Palestinians (not all) have formed violent groups which have attacked Israel to show them that they do not accept them. This conflict has been going on for a long long time now.<br>  <br>  Countries like Iran and Iraq have, at some in point in time, been on the side of Palestinians and rejected the existence of Israel as a state. In consequence they have supported Palestinians in many ways, including political, financial and even military ways. Israel, of course, as been forced to develop military supremacy in order to defend its territory and to protect its people (Jews). Israel has also taken land from the Arabs by force, so Arabs hate Israels even more because of that. The U.S. is more supportive of Israel because of economic reasons (Jewish business and investments in the U.S. and world are significant so the U.S. doesn't want to have problems with that) but over the last decades the U.S. has been more and more supportive about the idea of recognizing Palestine as a country.<br>  <br>  Some countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, stand kind of "neutral" and do not openly support Israel or the Palestinians. They are actually more in favor of peace and so they actually kind of act as mediators.<br>  <br>  India and Pakistan are a different story. They have been in dispute for many years because of some land in-between both countries called "Cashmere". Pakistanies say Cashmere is Pakistan land. India says Cashmere is Indian land. So both countries keep fighting for that land. India is believed to have developed nuclear power (weapons) to scare Pakistan and keep control of Cashmere. Pakistan claims they have also developed nuclear weapons too. So this creates tension in the area and so the U.S. got involved in order to prevent any nuclear disaster from happening.<br>  <br>  Iraq is also a story of its own: Iraq has a lot of oil. The U.S. economy depends on oil. Some terrorist muslim groups in Iran and Iraq are believed to be responsible of attacks to U.S. people and even the 9-11 events. The U.S. has taken advantage of these terrorist groups existence in order to invade Iraq and thus "controlling" that country in order to secure supply of oil to the U.S. At least this is what some people think.<br>  <br>  So, as you can see, it's many different conflicts but at least you have an idea of what they are all about.|`|AA10206300	Some like to re-phrase the history in the way that make them happy, even if its not the truth.

CoRLwVhjaa	All of these areas are good areas - however which one is going to be best for you depends on where you are working. You need to take into consideration your work location and your commute time.|`|AA11013113	Simple answer.   WIMBLEDON.   The whole area has been rejuvenated, with large stores, 2 huge shopping centres, bars, cafes. cinema and of course the famous Wimbledon Theatre (top names and pre West End shows).   Perhaps best of all  -  WIMBLEDON COMMON.   Short walk from town centre.   If you are looking for property, reasonable prices in town itself.   More expensive is Wimbledon Village, upmarket shops and boutiques.  Restaurants, pavement cafes  -  all frequented by the Tennis Stars.  In the village you are a few 100 yds. from Centre Court and the Common.<br>  There are many property bargains in the village right now.<br>  <br>  Hope I have said enough to convince you.<br>  <br>  It really is THE BEST.

dpKntiZoaa	Towns in the the same area are very different from one another concerning the amount of activity and social opportunities - so it is a little strange to taint a whole continent on this experience you have had.<br>  <br>  I do have sypathy with you, in that being an expat in a different country can be a difficult and is not as glamourous as many people would think from looking at the other side of the fence.  For some it can be quite isolating, living in a foreign country, not knowing the language, not having friends or extended family around (etc).<br>  <br>  However the reality comes that there is only one person to change that, and that is you.  <br>  <br>  From reading what you wrote, I would assume that you did not really get to know the locals (otherwise you would not ask what they did after 5pm).<br>  <br>  So taking a language class in the local language is always a good step.  This way you can start to understand and read things in your local environment.  Also you get a potential ready-made social network of people in a similar situation as yourself.<br>  <br>  Also sports are a great way to get rid of pressure and stress.  Reading a book (at least for me) is an instant de-stress.  So find a hobby you like and enjoy.  This can be a social club, sports at the local gym or a quiet hobby at home - it depends on what kind of person you are as to what will suit you personally.  The main thing is just to get some momentum and make a change. The only person that can do this is you.<br>  <br>  It is hard to be more specific as you don't mention even which country you are living in.<br>  <br>  Europe is a wonderful place with a lot to offer. Try a positive mindset next time you visit/live there and this can often make a big difference.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Europe is a large continent with so many different countries and cities.

Unless you are talking about your own losses or damages of a significant amount, it won't be worth pursuing. Your best course of action would be to hire an attorney to communicate your demands to Cebu Pacific under threat of lawsuit.  Second best course of action is for everybody to stop using them.  Their practice of advertising such things as 1 peso tickets that end up costing 10,000 pesos for fees and taxes should be against the law but they continue. Good luck in getting a refund.

Find out from them why only 30 days was given, and if there is a possibility to obtain more.  <br>  <br>  If there is a restriction on this, find out the details of this with a view to changing the issue that lies behind this restriction (e.g. financial support etc)<br>  <br>  It is always best to try to solve a problem in advance.

7PMpJqiiaa	Fall is perfect; the college kids and families have gone back to their routines, the crowds lessen somewhat and it is easier to get into venues and restaurants.  Also, although Hawaii has almost perfect weather year-round, it is a little too hot in summer and a little too cool in winter.  Now keep in mind, we are only talk a 7-degree spread; 75 in winter and 82 in summer, but it makes quite a difference with the tropical sun and humidity!<br>  <br>  Waikiki will give you the best nightlife and a lot of young people hanging out.  It is the most international island, so if you want a "Cancun" style resort area with less urban and international feel, and more rows of hotels that is Maui, in Kaanapali.<br>  <br>  The great thing about Hawaii is they understand service and the importance of tourists.  There is a high degree of hygiene and service, so even a lesser hotel although "old", will be clean and they will usually treat you well.  Given the economy don't write off a 4-star hotel, there are great deals right now.<br>  <br>  If you don't mind an older-but-clean room and $$$ is a bit of any issue, the Park Shore is in a great location, right across the street from the beach (there are no buildings directly on the beach on this side of Waikiki, so you have full ocean views from the rooms), usually about $150/night or less.  It is in the best area of Waikiki.  Service is excellent, but again rooms are old!  Near the zoo, aquarium, Kapiolani Park and a great walkway along the beach for people-watching.<br>  <br>  If you want to be in a more sophisticated, quiet part of Waikiki, I recommend the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel.  It is surrounded by Kapiolani Park, near Diamond Head in an area called the Gold Coast.  You literally walk right onto the sand, rooms are nice but SMALL, so that is the price you pay for a room sometimes under $200/night right on the beach.  Great surfing and snorkeling on this area of Waikiki.  this is a low-key, non-flashy low-rise, you can literally hear the waves and rustling coconut leaves from your room.<br>  <br>  If you want to be right in the center of things in Waikiki in a decent hotel, I think the Waikiki Marriott is the next step up and a great buy.  It also is in the area across the street from the beach but again no buildings in front of the hotel in this part of Waikiki so perfect views.  Usually runs about $260/night, but certainly you can get a deal with Marriotts right now.  A similar hotel nearby is Sheraton's Princess Kaiulani, but I have heard they are going to knock it down so make sure to check well in advance..also i doubt they are going to spend much $$$ to fix anything since it is (theoretically) going away.<br>  <br>  There are two newer boutique hotels in Waikiki I always hear a lot of good things, one is called the Bamboo Hotel (managed by the Aqua chain) and the other the Hotel Renew.  Prices under $200/night, but they are 2-3 blocks in from the beach but I have to tell you your experience will be so much better if you are able to walk right out to the beach, be near the action and see the beautiful views of Waikiki!<br>  <br>  Things to do:  Some simple advice:  (1) absolutely rent a car so you can drive around the island and go to deserted beaches on the windward side and enjoy views of the rain forest, (2) Go to famous Hanauma Bay National Underwarter Preserve right when it opens in the morning to avoid crowds and clouded water from all the tourists (and get a parking space!), (3) Go hiking in the jungle to at least one tropical waterfall, I always recommend Manoa Falls right in the back of Honolulu.|`|gEBBpvlFaa	Hi! Great question.<br>  <br>  I agree with the first poster. It seems like Oahu (Honolulu/Waikiki) is what you're looking for. The beaches on Oahu are great and there are lots of nice hotels to choose from that aren't necessarily too pricey. There are plenty of shopping and dining opportunities and lots of nightlife. I went to Oahu twice in my 20s and had a blast there! (I'm now 40 and live on Kauai, but I go to Oahu a few times a year to shop, eat, and have a good time!) <br>  <br>  Summer is warmer here than any other time of year, just as it is on the mainland. It is also very humid. Most kids are off school in the summer so lots of people travel here then. That makes prices higher. Supply and demand, you know! If you can wait until the second or third week in October to visit, it'll be less crowded and prices may be lower for airfare and hotels. Kids on the mainland will be back in school so families won't be traveling here as much and our mid-semester break (first week in Oct.) will be over. <br>  <br>  Here are some suggestions of things to do once you arrive:<br>  *take a catamaran sail off Waikiki beach<br>  *hike Diamond Head<br>  *snorkel at Hanauma Bay<br>  *visit the Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor<br>  *visit the Dole plantation and taste some REAL fresh pineapple!<br>  *eat some good local food like loco moco, ahi poke, tako, and chicken katsu<br>  *lie on the beach and get some sun!<br>  <br>  I prefer staying in a hotel to a condo, but that's just me. A condo can be more fun for a group than a hotel and less expensive if you buy some groceries to make your own breakfasts or whatever. (Keep in mind that groceries are NOT cheap here, but it's more economical to make your own omelet than it is to buy one at a restaurant every morning!) I only personally know one condo complex in Waikiki and I won't recommend it because I don't think it's what you're looking for. I will, however, list some good hotels that I think might work for you.<br>  <br>  Have a great trip and aloha!  :)|`|7fow1Wngaa	I suggest you should either stay at Ko'olina Beach Club or Ihilani Resort and Spa.. The Ihilani perferrably...!!! It is not in Waikiki but in Kapolei... It is near a waterpark and right next to Paradise Cove. At paradise cove you can experiece the polynesian culture.. There is also a waterpark near by...   Paradise Cove is a good place to see at night because you'll be able to eat hawaiian food and see a fire dance, hula, and much more...|`|BA3mGlTyaa	To try to answer all of the questions at once it would be Waikiki on the island of Oahu.  Oahu is the most populated island with the most people, biggest city, and the most things to do.  The other islands are more country with less of the city life.  Stay at the Hawaii Hilton Villages with the mention of the disposal income and visit another island while you are over here to see the contrast between them all.  The best time to visit, with your guidance, would be the spring and summer.  Sitting and relaxing on the beach is during these best times and Waikiki nightlife should be waking up from the winter months.<br>  <br>  First thing to do is to drive your rental car around the island to see where everything is and what everything is and you can start to branch out from there. <br>  <br>  Just another local...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hawaii-vacation-adventures-oahu.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hawaii-vacation-adventures-oa...</a>|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	if i were you, i would go to Oahu. Waikiki beach in downtown Honolulu is just made for people like you. You'll have plenty of sun, beach, night clubs, pretty girls, commercialized "Hawaiian culture", the whole nine yards.<br>  <br>  the area has mostly five star resorts, but im sure that if you go a block or so inwards, you'll find a perfectly suitable hotel that doesn't cost upwards of $5,000 a night.<br>  <br>  also, a word of advice. we hawaiians tend to be very territorial when it comes to white (or Haole, as you will most likely be referred to) tourists coming around popular local areas. if you don't want to cause trouble with the locals, just stick to the tourist areas, there are more of them on Oahu than there are local areas anyways, so it won't be that hard.

oLlZV7Ffaa	I understand the situation that you are in now but sorry to say, if you want to return legally, you still have to pay a fine.<br>  I suppose that your special pass already expired on the 11th February. What you can do now is to take your original passport and your confirmed return ticket ( on the 1st of March ) to the Immigration Department in Putrajaya ( if you are somewhere int the Klang Valley ). Otherwise you have to go to the nearest immigration department. You will have to pay a fine of  RM30 per day. This means you have to pay RM30 per day from 12th February right up to 1st March. This works out to RM540 (RM30 x 18 days). Once you have paid this fine, you'll be given a special pass valid up to your departure date. Once you have overstayed more than 30 days, you have to pay a minimum fine of RM3000. So be careful , don't allow yourself to miss your 1st March flight.<br>  <br>  It seems like you are more worry about your ticket than the possibility of being detained. If you do not  pay the above fine, it is almost impossible to return to your country legally. If you get detained, you'll be sent to detention camp waiting for deportation ( it could take weeks or even months before the authority send you back ). However since you already have a ticket, in the event you get arrested, pass the ticket to someone you know and ask him to re-book your flight. After re-booking, ask your friend to pass the ticket to the authority. This way, you'll be deported much earlier. If the airlines you are flying does not allow to re-schedule your flight, then you have no choice but to get someone to purchase a new ticket and pass it to the authority. If you want to return for free, then you have to wait for the Malaysian government to deport you which could take weeks or months )<br>  <br>  However my advice to you is to go to the immigration department with your passport , confirmed returnn ticket and some money to pay the fine immediately. Try to appeal to the authority for fine reduction ( they do consider to give fine reduction for those with good reasons ). If they don't grant you a reduction, just pay the amount ( ask your family to send money to you. you still have time to do so ).<br>  <br>  DO NOT go directly to the airport with an expired special pass. There is no way you could return to your country with expired documents. You'll be detained on the spot.|`|fd69272cc2b6016b2264e570e7b7a247aa	occupy some land illegally, build a house with wood and corrugated iron scraps you steal from building sites, steal electricity, steal water, plant a couple of fruit trees, get a job as a construction worker and make sure you vote during the next elections.

AA11375099	I go to Swedish Hospital every week for my wife's chemotherapy.  That area is very nice along Madison Street.  Lot's of new apartments are being built there and many have move in bonus's.<br>  <br>  You should be able to get a nice one bedroom for that amount.  The amenities around there are terrific!  Just a short walk into town, close to Broadway and sort of away from Pike and Pine streets in the evenings.  (where there are a lot of clubs and noise when they close from people leaving them could be loud).<br>  <br>  I would try to find a place by the Sorrento Hotel.  I know along Boren Street there are some Apartments available.  Again I believe Madison Street would be cool or around Saint James Catholic Church.  <br>  <br>  It really is a nice place to live.

If you are worried about the money there, there is a pizza parlor right on the corner of the street that may be cheaper for you. <br>  <br>  Also New Roc parking is $0.75 per hour. Don't forget to pay for parking because they will ticket you in a second. Always keep that receipt from the machine because sometimes they will ticket you even if you did pay, but if you can show the guy on the way out that you paid they will take the ticket away, but make you you have that receipt and show them before you leave!!<br>  <br>  Other than that there shouldn't be any other hidden fees. ...

OYYYNCyCaa	why would you get on a plane if you had to bring your own parachutes <br>  <br>  that would tell me there is a good chance this plane is going down|`|PRzmwFfgaa	Probably because if people had parachutes, people who over react would try to jump off the plane every time there is a little bit of turbulence.  If you were to open the door of a plane while the plane was in the air the plane would capsize and everyone would have to jump off.  Could you imagine how many planes would be crashing all over the place just because of this one person who over reacted, jumping off and causing everyone else to have to jump off???|`|VxtSO8BGaa	"Hi"....sure it's fine if the plane is in level flight and the air isn't too thin so that you could breathe and everyone was trained and you had time to put it on !<br>  <br>  But if you are at 42.000 ft. and there is rapid and sudden decompression and you are screaming towards earth in a nose down attitude at 700 mph with all 150 passengers suffering 2G's.....well you get my point ! *S* <br>  <br>  Parachutes are just not an option on high level flying Commercial aircraft.<br>  <br>  But  the other hand I remember the situation where an aircraft ( a Transair Commercial Jet) simply ran out of fuel over the Atlantic from Canada to Europe and the Pilot glided to the Azores , the longest glide in aviation history and made a safe landing with no engines !<br>  <br>  Remember the most recent incident on the Hudson and that superb piece of flying with no engines and a successful water landing ! <br>  <br>  On the other hand the tragic recent Buffalo incident just proved that a sudden drop did not give any time at all to remedy his flight path.<br>  <br>  So, as long as their is not a catastrophic failure of the aircraft itself then it is safer with  the time tested and current practise of relying  on the Flight Crew's  skills to make an emergency landing.<br>  <br>  Good question though ! *S* (Michael C...)|`|AA11485682	Not really. Because without proper training, a parachute can be fatal. And training everyone who gets on a plane in how to use them just isn't feasible.<br>  <br>  And there are very few cases where a plane is damaged where a parachute would be necessary.

SuZbBnycaa	Take the ferry to Catalina at 9am. Watch the dolphins follow your boat there. Get your palm read, play 9 holes of golf, walk the botanical gardens, rent a golf cart and check out the bison, buy a membership (it's $1 dollar and good for 4 days) at the beach. It's the only California public beach that you are allowed to have a drink on. There is a palm covered bar with umbrella drinks. Check out the events schedule, because they often have live music on the beach. Or go to the "Casino" in Avalon (there's no gambling, it's just called that) for indoor music entertainment. Be on the boat at 4pm to return. Don't be late.

aiH9WmnKaa	Poverty and Underdevelopment in the Hindi Belt<br>  One of the conundrums facing modern India is how even though Hindi speakers make up a plurality of the nation's population, it is predominantly the Hindi-speaking states whose social indicators are the most depressing.  This is especially puzzling considering their relative proximity to Delhi, the nation's capital, and their often decisive role in determining who gets to rule the country. <br>  <br>  <br>  For Indians concerned about equitable and broad-based progress, this is naturally a matter of concern. However, to date, there has been little consensus on the reasons for this  apparent anomaly. While some intellectuals have attributed this relative social backwardeness and underdevelopment to heightened casteism and communalism, others have attributed this state of affairs to the 'cultural backwardness' of India's Hindi-speakers.  Some Indian industrialists have complained of a poor work culture and political instability driving off potential investors. <br>  <br>  <br>  Yet, during Mughal rule, the UP plains were home to the highest concentration of specialized pre-industrial manufacturing. Moradabad specialized in brassware, Saharanpur and Nagina in woodwork and furniture, Aligarh in locks and bolts, Firozabad in glassware, Mirzapur in  carpet-weaving, Khurja in pottery, Rae Bareilly in textiles, and Agra,  Lucknow and Benaras could boast of artisans and craftsmen with extraordinary skills in a very wide range of manufactures. Neither were the lesser-known courtly centers (such as Rampur, Jaunpur, Farrukhabad or Faizabad) wanting in fine artists or well-trained musicians. <br>  <br>  <br>  Although not as much is known about Mughal Bihar, Siwan's pottery was comparable to Khurja's, Patna's weavers were as skilled as any in Agra or Lucknow, and Sasaram's architects  were as capable and creative as those of Allahabad. Bettiah and Darbhanga can still boast of posessing some of the country's finest Dhrupad gharanas, and Bihar's Madhubani artists are second to none. Jharkhand and Chhatisgarh's metal-workers continue to produce items of intriguing beauty, and anyone with even a passing familiarity with the arts and crafts of Bundelkhand and neighbouring Chhatarpur (Khajuraho) would know of the region's industriousness, as would those who have had the good fortune to travel through other parts of Madhya Pradesh. Shivpuri's marble and inlay workers were as skilled as those of Agra and Delhi; Dhar's block printers display talents comparable to their Gujarati or Rajasthani counterparts, and the weavers of Chanderi are no less skilled than those of Benaras. Besides, Gwalior, Bhopal and Indore were as culturally developed as any other city in Bengal, Gujarat or South India.<br>  <br>  <br>  And contrary to the view of certain communally-biased historians, the Hindu courts of the Hindi-belt (whether in Rajasthan, Himachal, or in  Benaras, Datia or Orchha) were no less cultured , or lacking in highly-skilled and industrious artisans and craftspeople than those of the imperial Mughals. There is also anecdotal and physical evidence that suggests that the industrousness of the Hindi-belt was not just a Mughal phenomenon. Arab commentators have left glowing accounts of the wealth and the quality of the crafts of the Sultanates of Northern India, and in his memoir's Babar reluctantly acknowledges the wide range of specialized skills available amongst the workers of Northern India that he had subjugated.   Surviving pottery and other artifacts would appear to bolster the conclusion that the fineness of Indian manufactures could not be simply attributed to Mughal intervention.<br>  <br>  <br>  Neither would it be fair to ascribe the post-Islamic virtuosity of Indian manufactures just to imitation of Persian imports or Persian training. At the very least, the few surviving pre-Islamic monuments of the Gangetic plains points to a prolific sculptural output. In Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhatisgarh, an enormous number of early and late medieval temple sites have survived more or or less intact - alluding to a widely dispersed tradition of monumental architecture, thus indirectly attesting to North Indian industriousness. <br>  <br>  <br>  Since the North Indian plains were at the front lines of the Islamic invasions, there are too few surviving monuments and artifacts to truly assess the productivity of pre-Islamic India; however, the virtuosity of North Indian sculptors can be gleaned from the numerous sculptural finds from the Hindi-speaking states. It may be worth underlining that  several surviving sculptures from Bihar match or excel those found in Bengal - whether from the Pala period, or the earlier Gupta period, or the still earlier Mauryan period. Similarly, if one were to compare sculptural finds from Sarnath, Mahoba, Gwalior, Vidisha or Jabalpur with those from a comparable period in South India - one would be hard-pressed to argue that the sculptors of Northern India were any less refined or sophisticated than their Southern counter|`|5wAAnZPYaa	Due to the domination of backwards.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Very Poor governance,Illiteracy,heavy population,and the cate system prevailing based on which votes are caste is the major region for the backwardness of Uttar pradesh and Bihar which send the highest number of MPs to parliament.|`|7Qpdm6rFaa	illiteracy is the main reason, so these state goes into hands on corrupt politician   that will change one day

You can fly anywhere that the airline flies BUT make sure you can get back. I remember a whole bunch of us were stuck in Australia once, no free seats on any airline for days! <br>  <br>  What you need to find out the taxes and fees. Is it worth flying standby for that price?<br>  <br>  The way it worked with my old employer is that there was a charge taken out of our salaries. The "buddy" didn't pay directly so your friend could end up with an ugly surprise in his or her paystub. <br>  <br>  If the airline person doesn't know, his/her supervisor will. You can also try calling reservations at a quiet hour and ask them about this. I recommend calling when most travel agents are closed. That would be early morning on the East Coast, late at night on the West.<br>  <br>  By the way, make sure the information is current. Don't have your friend find out from someone whose mom went to Tokyo last year. These fees can vary. <br>  <br>  Also, you can do what a lot of my friends did. I ended up giving away very few passes because they would call up an agent and say "My friend who works for XYZ airlines offered me a buddy pass but I don't want to fly standby. I'll pay a bit more if you can get me a guaranteed place..."<br>  <br>  A carrot to the horse!

(boulder is the opposite end of the spectrum...)<br>  <br>  i can't really help you with the schools, but you can find beautiful hiking spots almost anywhere in colorado. check out old-timey small towns nearby for kitschy shops, and malls for whatever else. <br>  <br>  weather: wearing shorts, a tank top, and a parka is a common thing in colorado. you can leave for school in 7 degrees and eat lunch outside in 60 degrees, you never know. the worst snow season is during march and april, when we get 3-4 feet at a time during an average blizzard. (schools don't close very often though--they expect coloradans to suck it up and deal with it...) however, in the summer, it's between 80 and sometimes 100 degrees every day, and always sunny, dry, and beautiful. <br>  <br>  if you're able to get out of the springs once in a while, check out WaterWorld, Six Flags (if it's still open...i heard they were going bankrupt though...), or Devils Tower. <br>  <br>  good luck!!!<br>  <br>  p.s. 1 more thing: it's super dry in the winter, so stock up on moisturizer/lotion/vaseline/whatever. you'll need it!!
UqPZezXBaa	There are plenty of good hotels in Melbourne. I <a href="http://www.MelbourneAaccommodation.tv" rel="nofollow">http://www.MelbourneAaccommodation.tv</a> to book online because they don't charge all the additiononal 'booking fees' that the likes of wotif and lastminute charge, Their rates are also often slightly cheaper.  There is a 'Melbourne CBD' buttom which will isolate all the accommodation in central Melbourne. <br>  <br>  There are a couple of good areas in Melbourne for shopping. Certainly the area around Bourke Street and Swaston Street is excellent. Chapel Street was mentioned in another post and it is also very good but from central Melbourne it is a 20 minute tram ride.<br>  <br>  Bridge Road Richmond, also atram ride from the city is also a good shopping option. Hope this helps.

Bounded by La Trobe St up the top, Flinders St down the bottom and Spencer St and Spring St. There is also a free city circle tram which runs this loop.<br>  <br>  Bourke Street is the main street that runs through the city and encompasses the big shopping centres with Myer and DJs.  The main street running the opposite direction is Swanston Street, part of which is closed off to traffic (except trams) for the mall. <br>  <br>  Chapel Street is the designer fashion street, in South Yarra. <br>  <br>  Bridge Road is the discount shopping street, located in Richmond. This is a MUST visit. Also on Spencer St there is a DFO (Discount Factory Outlet). <br>  <br>  St Kilda Road is another you must visit, running down past the beach and Luna Park, the street is lined with eateries and shops. <br>  <br>  Flinders street is another big street that runs right across the river and past federation square and the main train station (Flinders St Station)<br>  <br>  Here's a map that also shows the tram lines - <a href="http://www.amsa.gov.au/Natship_2004/images/map.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.amsa.gov.au/Natship_2004/imag...</a> Looking at the map, the left half is basically the business district while the red is the retail. <br>  <br>  My favourite place to stay in Melbourne for location and value is the Quest on Burke. It's about 1 block from the main shopping area and is right there on the main street between Russel St and Exhibition St. They have beautiful roomy 1 and 2 bedroom apartments starting at around $150 a night. Its 4 or 4.5 star, only thing it misses is a restaurant but you have so many others you don't need it. <br>  <br>  For a cheap meal try the Elephant and the Wheelburrow, its a pub with great meals. For italian you HAVE to go to Lygon Street in Carlton. The street is lined with italian restaurants desperate for you to dine with them, they will give you free wine, free garlic bread, etc..

oXOcZIeNaa	Actually we don't like it very well. Starbucks doesn't make a lot of money in France, because we like our "café" place. <br>  We're drinking especially espresso, like italians or spanish people, and we stay like one or two hours with only one drink sometimes, and a lot of french people do the same thing in Starbucks and keep the sit all the afternoon... Also we don't buy drink to take away as british or americans do.<br>  For me, the biggest problem (I'm student so I ain't no money) is the price. The drinks in Starbucks are f****** expensive!!!|`|vZToCRVuaa	not as much as the americans. they prefer wine. even for lunch.|`|wg0hmrvWaa	I don't. <br>  It doesn't look like real coffee, which for us is only expresso. They aren't many Starbucks in Paris, and they are fairly recent, so they are packed. But I would be surprised to have them spread to every corner like in the US. Also we have coffee in normal cups, not plastic or carton. It smells better that way. We don't take-away our coffee. <br>  <br>  We also make our own coffee at work. There are more and more expresso machines that people share, it's better than the instantané from machines.|`|vNeTmHu9aa	There are lots of Starbucks locations in Paris, and they have always been crowded when I have been there.  As to whether or not the people in the crowd were actually French, I don't know.  <br>  <br>  What I do know is that my French friend loves Peppermint Mochas from there!  LOL|`|AA12005775	It's becoming more popular and well-known. It's kind of a status symbol as well. For example, my French friends coming to the US this summer can't wait to go to Starbucks because "C'est trop cool!" <br>  Young people that have gone like to casually brag about it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now that doesn't exactly mean they like it......|`|tt08Ve96aa	all of Europe is crammed with Starbucks..well ive only been to England and France and Germany...and there was like one on every corner|`|40HICcNOaa	There really seem to be starbucks everywhere you'd expect them in the US: on busy streets, across from Metros, in the malls...  I think the only difference is that Americans who are in France feel dirty going in to them because they left america to have delicious French and European coffee, and having coffee by the Mochagiant from back home makes us feel like we might as well have ripped up the train ticket and just stayed home watching Paris je t'aime.|`|44a6ef9837a5b1d4767e8998e4f06040aa	Not like Americans. They call American Coffee "watered down coffee". They get the really thing in coffee shops. My family in Switzerland came here in the US and hated Starbucks.|`|8bb7564e6b51f403a948dbb1465c7692aa	They do, French people are just as dumb as the americans
nddmwDAmaa	Pakistan people don't like the westerners but they don't like the Taliban either. all the english movies that are available in Pakistan, all the media rumours, women going to beaches and stuff and other totally makes the Pakistani people think that the westerner women are whores. Pakistani people value traditions, honour and dignity. Pakistanis are muslims and the don't like the western culture, the invasions that they do though they do admire their success. <br>  <br>  The culture is what they hate, that's all. The way the westerners are right now, it's totally contrary to what they were fifty years ago or even 20 years ago. The westerners of th 80's would detest the westerners of today as well. <br>  <br>  Pakistan will not take over the country and the population would never support them. If the population supported them, why would the taliban need to use force to make people follow their orders. Pakistan has one of the largest armed forces in the world, a couple thousand taliban trained by them can't defeat our brave soldiers. It will soon be over, all we need is to kill corruption and keep democracy alive.|`|t6MHAb55aa	A country very friendly to arabs,chinese and north koreans but has serious problems with west.The reason is because usa considers pakistan a threat and several times Pakistani intelligence which is known in world top intel found out that american spy agency cia hired bombers and america helped anti-pakistan elements.Pakistan also has issues with usa over helping enemies of Pakistan.Pakistan is known as "favorite younger brother " of saudi king and "best friend " of china.USA has many times betrayed Pakistan and even usa is behind murders of Pakistani leaders which is cause of concern for Pakistani nation.with over 97% in pakistan and highly advanced armed forces who are extremely good at warfare and known as closest allies of arab world.Pakistan has extreme backing of almost all arab nations and then extreme support from china who considers pakistan a very strong defense shield.America fears Pakistan as any fight with pakistan might result in ww3.with close allinace with arabs and china , west feels pakistan is a threat.no pakistanis don't support taliban but they do BLAME AMERICA FOR THIS TALIBAN AND BLOODSHED.since pakistan became an ally of usa who had losses of $350 billion since started fighting american war.lost 26,000 of its troops fighting american war.lost 15,000 of innocent women and children fighting american war.still all this America calls pakistan a terrorist country who isnot loyal to america.President of pakistan musharaf said "american president threaten to drop bombs on Islamabad,warned pakistan will be in rubles and said pakistan would go back to stone age and die hungry if they didn't help out invading army in Afghanistan.they abused Pakistan on phone and told me listen to us or you will pay price".Pakistan is close ally of china,saudi arabia,uae and arab world .it has extreme mix of population and only muslim nuclear power with nukes targeting europe.it has most mix of population mostly arabs,persian,uzaeks,tajiks,turks.wheras Pakistan army chief believes "america is pakistan worst enemy who at any time would attack pakistan as pakistan is muslims most powerful military power and whose army is 2 nd best trained military of world after israel.Pakistan armed forces are known in world for extreme military strength and they defeated world super power soviets with this same army so america fears pakistan army as one of most dangerous and advanced military of muslim world.Pakistan has economic backings of saudi arabia,china..whenever pakistan gets economic troubles , saudi arabia often bails them out and china provides funds.

rOY2J0UAaa	You go to high school in New Zealand for five years generally. You start from about age 12/13 and you will be a Year 9, then in your final year (Year 13 you will be around 17/18). Years 9 and 10 are known as Juniors, and Seniors are years 11 - 13. Most schools in New Zealand wear uniforms, and it is not uncommon to go to single sex schools - there are a lot of them! I know in Christchurch it's about 50/50 single sex/ co-ed schools. My school started at 8.40, and most start around that time- 8,45, or 9.00 etc. And finish around 3.00 - either earlier or later depending on the day. In most places wednesday is the 'sport day' and so we finished at 2.30.<br>  <br>  The general curriculum is English (at my school was compulsory to year 12 then optional in year 13, Maths (often split into statistics or calculus in Year 13), Science (later split in to chemistry, physics and biology), Social Studies (generally taken in year 9 & 10, then splits into geography and history, though some schools still offer it to senior years), usually schools offer languages (French, German, Maori, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, and some schools even offer Latin!), Art (This was compulsory at my school in year 9, then an option through later years and in senior years it split into painting/ printmaking, photography/ design or graphics), Music (was compulsory for us in year 9, then could be taken as an option to year 13. And in years 12 and 13 you can take classical studies or art history. Most schools offer other subjects such as Economics (splitting into accounting or economics in years 12 and 13), I.T. (basically computer studies), home economics (sewing or hospitality/ cooking), P.E. (physical education - this was compulsory in year 9 and 10, then became and option), and Drama.<br>  <br>  Pretty much everyone has a computer, and most schools have computers rooms for everyone to use. <br>  I'm not to sure on the AP or honours classes, but some schools have streamed subjects - where more capable students do a slightly harder/ modified course. <br>  <br>  After school, some go home, some go to the dairy or get food somewhere and a lot go to their local mall. <br>  <br>  At my school we had sports groups, and one was for surfing, so they went out on a wednesday to the beach for a competition or just a fun surf. i surf and i just used to go out whenever. summer is really good hear, and you can still go in winter if your keen :D - it also does depend on where you are going to be living. - Same goes for skimboarding. My school also had a snow boarding group and in the winter they went to mount hut or somewhere else in the Alps occasionally. Majority of tourists who snowboard here go to Queenstown for snowboarding, but there are of course other places for that. (in the North Island mainly Ruapehu).<br>  <br>  Most people here will be really interested in where you are from in the U.S. and you will probably be asked a ton of questions! So it won't be hard to make friends or anything either. Other than that you should have a good time, most people are nice :D|`|vQ6zwJqZaa	At my High School there's so many foreign exchange students there are buildings dedicated to just getting them introduced to New Zealand alone. Japan, Germany, UK, and the US, I have these people in just my classes alone, so you would fit in just fine. Computers? Hundreds of them (at school) and almost everyone has at least one computer at home. <br>  <br>  Depending on where you live here, most students head of to town after school and hang out there, or the mall if there's one around. If you're lucky to be at a school by the beach and it's warm enough, then then yeah you might go for a dip. Kids here usually buy ice creams after school from the 'dairy' (that's Kiwiana for a typical small store if you don't know. We're all about Ice cream here so they usually have a wide range to chose from- oh and i don't know what you call them but we call 'ice lollies' 'ice blocks'.) Surfing is usually for the holidays, the christmas/summer holidays in particular (you should know that NZ christmas is in the summer!) and stuff like skiing and snowboarding is done on Mt. Rurapehu (it's an active Volcano but it's pretty safe!) or the mountains in the South Island (Queenstown is well known for that stuff.) You'd have to ask around about the parkour stuff, sorry i don't know what that's all about. <br>  <br>  I've been in NZ for four years and in every class i've had there's always been less guys than girls, so you'll be welcomed by the girls and the guys. That, and being from a foreign country, i'm sure you'll become a bit of a babe magnet! People will be curious about where you come from, therefore find you interesting and cool because of your accent. <br>  <br>  Just be yourself, relax, and the rest should fall into place. <br>  Do you know whereabouts in NZ you're planning to stay? Contact me if you want to know anything else.<br>  All the foreign students i've spoken to say they are enjoying life in NZ, and i'm sure you will too! :)|`|nwakChpTaa	New Zealand high schools are much the same as other high schools. What do you want to know specifically? Mostly, they start at 8:30 am, finish at about 3:00pm. We have 2-3 breaks during the day and do subjects like: languages, art, music, drama, Social Studies, Science, English, Maths, PE (Sport), Health and options.|`|Qtys8AiTaa	regarding AP or honours courses - not exactly. As someone said, some schools do have more able students in another class so that you can learn further. However, what IS common, at least amongst schools near a university is to offer their students university courses or some polytechnics (no idea what they are called in the US - trade schools?) classes. Even when I was in high school we had people going to the university (Victoria) and taking mathematics and english courses there. A lot do this. <br>  <br>  However, it seems that the focus for more exchange students is the 'cultural' rather than academic side of life. So, get involved with the groups, teams and activities the school may offer here. Join the environment clubs, the social committees (ie the ones organising the school dances and parties), play on a rugby team, join the tennis team, join the ski club (my high school had a ski club and we were in Wellington so it's not restricted to those on the mountain). If you are from a city, join a rural or agricultural club. <br>  <br>  Skimboarding? The only skim boarding I know of are beach skimboards - are these the ones you mean? I suspect schools near the beach have people who go surfing more. I lived near a surf beach (5 - 10 min drive) and being in the surf lifesaving club was a popular activity. Do most people have computers? Hmmm, I would say that most people who are not particularly low income would. I think someone who is hosting you almost certainly would. I don't know anyone who doesn't have a computer at home unless they have particular 'philosophical' reasons against having one.|`|TbM4K6Ytaa	lol we just got an american exchange student in my maths class the other day and she seems interesting. with international students at my school were really friendly towards them(i am, at least. i find it really easy to talk to and get along with exchange students), yeah and we find out lots about where theyre from etc.if youre meaning at home, pretty much everyone has a computer. after school we usually go home or go to the mall or something. and ive never heard of skimboarding lol, i guess you could go surfing but its not talked about much, and if you wanna snowboard, you have to go to mt ruapehu in the north island or some of the other mountains down in the south island during the winter months. and ive never heard of free-runs or parkour sorry.<br>  <br>  youll have a great time here! :D lol.|`|0M5XYROfaa	Most people have computers at home yes, but there is usually lots at school to. School day goes from 8:30 till 3pm usually, after school people do all sorts of things. Its your spare time so you can do whatever(if your exchange family approves of course). The weekends are a great time to go snowboarding and surfing etc.|`|0schtq9Laa	I never gone to High School (they call it college here...lol, but some are called High school) here, but my classmates told me some about their college (high school) life...<br>  <br>  . They don't know about AP and honors (honors maybe???) here. Instead they do it by level (1, 2 ,3 and 4...e.g English 3, Chem 2..etc) on the topic they (student) plan on taking, NCEA is like a prerequisite for College, they call it University here. So if your like me, I have AP and honors and good grades (As and Bs) and they didn't recognize it for some weird reason or I just have one messed up consultant when I was enrolling for College here. So I took all their NCEA crap, basically I redid Physics, Chemistry, English!!! and Maths...be warned!!!!<br>  <br>  . Loads of computer over here, they hardly use myspace here, they mostly use bebo and facebook.<br>  <br>  . Students go home, study, hangout, sports...etc. Basically the same as US HS student.<br>  <br>  . Some of my classmates do surfing alot. But they live near the beach.<br>  <br>  . Since I am from L.A (90039), they mostly ask - is it a rough place, gangs, drugs, shootings, murder...etc basically what the media feed to New Zealand and notting positive about the States so they think am some bad ***...but am not. Well lets say, most people here will just judge whatever they think about you. So just be yourself.<br>  <br>  . Extra info...NZ high school kids are not very trendy. So if you drive a nice car they all go praising about it for some weird reason compared back at the states they just give a hate or :) and if you have mad skills in an instrument, again they praise.
JixDtZmdaa	J1 as in exchange student visa? Who are you going to exchange with...silly question I know but if I were you I'd apply for F-1 instead. In order to do so go quick to a US college or university, get accepted and ask them to give an I-20. When you get that send an F-1 application, your I-20, letter of acceptance and proof of financial stability to the embassy along with your passport so they can put an F-1 visa in before your M1 expires!!!

You can get fan rooms slightly cheaper.<br>  The cheapest meal of the day will be breakfast at roughly P200. Most meals will run P300-P500 for lunch and dinner. <br>  <br>  So unless you plan on buying noodles from the sari sari and eating that 3x's a day I recommend you either increase your budget or decrease your stay. It's peak season now and if your thinking of holy week super peak rates apply.|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	Better get in touch with NEXUS Travel Agency for cheapest airfares and they can also assist you.<br>  Happy Trip!!!!!|`|RbPBu3MKaa	Subic bay or the Zambales coast is a good alternative and better pricing.

1LTrZbxwaa	The road can be narrow going up there. Just remember to be cautious when going up that mountain. Since it your first time I would advice you not to go too fast. It can get pretty hairy sometimes, especially the first time, but if you are careful it should be no problem. <br>  <br>  There will probably be several vehicles piling up behind you since you aren't going to be as fast as the more experience drivers. When that happens you are required to pull over and let them pass, I think if 4 or more are behind you. There are outlets or shoulders on the road to let you do this, every so often. Just be careful when merging back into the road.<br>  <br>  You also need chains. If there is snow at all you are required chains, or they will tell you to turn back. You don't have the option of trying to have go at it without chains, the cops will make you turn around. You can buy the chains on the side of the road there are guys who will install it for a fee.|`|lLZqNNUdaa	You'll do fine, but just remember that the mountains are crowded on the weekends so bring your patients. Just prior to departing call the Caltrans toll free 24 hour road condition hot line at 1-800-427-6723 for the latest road conditions.|`|8ccab7c316b95a6985a1c10403b9c80daa	Keep an eye on the weather reports. Lately we've had a lot of rain and snow which has made mountain driving dangerous. Also keep a set of tire chains, in case you need them if you're driving during a snow storm. I think that the 38 through Mentone/Redlands would be the easier drive. The 330 is a more winding route. Although it is a slightly longer route.

0TTGNpP3aa	I have lived both places and MUCH prefer Dallas.  Friendlier people, more to do, no nasty winters!!, beautiful suburbs, cost of living is WAY less!!!, better place to raise a family.  I won't even VISIT Denver now, that is how much I hated it!  I also lived in California and I wouldn't live there again to save my life!!  I would visit there however!  LOL|`|gsQU85fIaa	Dallas  your family should come first|`|UiMJzazTaa	I lived in Denver for ten years. But I don't know much about Dallas, so hopefully this list will help you with some of the realities of living in Denver:<br>  <br>  Pros: Absolutely beautiful all summer<br>  Friendly people<br>  Lots of things to do for every type of interest<br>  Upper-class sort of people<br>  earth-friendly living, green living<br>  <br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  job competition is steep<br>  6 months of snow, snow, snow<br>  no family there (as you said)<br>  <br>  And some truths: most people there are friendly but it takes a while for Midwesterners to trust you as a friend.  Politically, most Coloradans are liberal or democratic (not sure if that is a pro or con for you). The winters are terribly dry and it snows a lot, and the terrain is muddy and brown for about 5 months out of the year.  If you've never lived in a cold climate before, you'll have to get used to wearing snow boots sometimes, shoveling snow, chains on your tires, black ice, and occasional blizzards.  However, the summers are just breathtakingly beautiful and the air is so clean and healthy that it's worth all of the dreariness of winter. There is so much to do outdoors, from skiing to hiking to camping and going to free concerts and so much more.  Denver is relatively clean compared to other cities and it has a lot of great shopping and restaurants.  It's also fairly close to Boulder, which is probably the most quaint and unforgettable place in the US.  <br>  <br>  Good luck in your decision, I hope this helps!
1lsvWj6zaa	when you check your luggage in the airlines put tags on it this tag has a barcode on it and it is this that tells baggage handlers where its got to go hope this helps|`|BqXSymxjaa	Oh, I don't know, maybe by the tag your supposed to put on the bag.|`|H3WfJY5Eaa	I use to work at a airport. <br>  <br>  And it's simple.  If you have a connection flight your tag is diffrent from other Non-connection bags.  <br>  <br>  You'll have a "IAD to LAX to DAL"<br>  <br>  Your tag is connection so its loaded into a different container (or part of the plan, depending on the size of your plane.)<br>  <br>  Then that container is taken to a room with belts leading to each flight (airlines).  The people offloading the bag (which was me most of the time) will look at the tag, and send it to the correct flight, or airline.  <br>  <br>  Its taken to the top, where someone from the company will put it aside, or hand it to you.<br>  <br>  *** They are only scanned so they are "counted" - That information is then transferred with the plain to the other airport.  That information is then used to make sure all bags are accounted for.  Yes, local bags and connection bags are scanned into different (sections, or containers within the plane) - but that information isn't really USED for that purpose.  Each airline that has a connection flight from another airline will receive a fax with that passenger, and bags number - That information is only entred once the bags have been accounted for (The new airport/airline will give the bag its own tag, which is then scanned)<br>  <br>  A system in one airport isn't connected to another.  In no way shape or form, only evidence of your bag is a fax and a data sheet.<br>  <br>  All bags, at least in the USA must be RESCANNED (By TSA and that flight) at every new airport.<br>  <br>  Your bag is treated as if you just brought into the airport.|`|a6j7Bu9daa	They are seperated by baggage carts by each plane and then they are scanned, they have barcodes on the tags they put on.

I have lived in Sydney for over 20 years and love it. I have also lived in Melbourne and London. <br>  <br>  If you want to live in a nice area of Sydney be prepared to pay $$$ for a good property.<br>  <br>  The nicest areas in my opinion are:<br>  <br>  Lower North Shore - namely Kirribilli, Neutral Bay, Cremorne, Waverton which are all close to the harbour and easy access to the city. <br>  <br>  Northern Beaches - namely Fairlight, Little Manly, Mona Vale, Newport - if you like the beach these suburbs are great, very laid back, family friendly, lots of cafes. It can be a painful drive into the city from Mona Vale and Newport (about 1 hour) but from Fairlight and Little Manly it is just a quick ferry ride.<br>  <br>  Eastern Suburbs - namely North Bondi, Bronte and Rose Bay. Beaches and cafes. Safe neighbourhoods. Close to city. <br>  <br>  Near Sydney City - namely Paddington, Newtown, King St Wharf, Erskineville. All great location for the city lifestyle. Newtown and Erskineville are eclectic nieghbourhoods with lots of soul. Paddington is expensive and trendy. King St Wharf is right in the city, on the harbour, near LOADS of bars, restaurants, nightclubs etc.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

i7oHTo9haa	Hi. 3million tourist came into Israel last year and 3million tourists made it safely back home.  There is no worry to come to Israel as everything is under control in Israel proper.  As long as you follow directions to not go to places within rocket range of the territories of Gaza Strip or to Arab controlled areas that are currently under control in Judea and Samaria you will be A-OK.  If you do actually want to go to Judea and Samaria Holy Sites you can have it arranged thru Israel and they will tell you latest security procedure for that region when you get there. Using also Israeli tour guide is safest thing to do when traveling around because they know where to go and not go so as to not wander off in bad area of those territories.  So if not using tour guide then ask Israeli police or soldiers where to go/not go. Israel has best security and takes their job seriously so no worries at all. Currently they are forming new government in Israel so there is not likely to be any major hostilities.  By the time you get to Israel there will be a new government and always when something happens the government will give warning to react.. so no problem okay you will be fine especially in Tel Aviv that is far away from any rocket fire. Have fun enjoy your trip :)|`|8cWXhZGjaa	Traveling to Israel is reltively safe. As long as you don't travel to the West Bank, Gaza Strip or within 30 km of rocket range of the Gaza Strip  you'll be away from the war and be fine by just exercising common sense. Do not travel alone, be alert to any danger and suspicious activity, and avoid riding public buses. Other then that you'll be fine and will have a great time there. <br>  <br>  Edit: Tel Aviv is actually one of the most safest cities in Israel, it's not near any land, disputed territory or holy site that most of the Palestinians are interested in. The only time Tel Aviv can be dangerous is if Israel is at war with Lebanon which of course they currently are not.|`|1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	The answer is Yes, Yes, Yes!<br>  <br>  I understand that after receiving a steady dose of Palestinian terrorism with bloody pictures of Israeli victims through television and newspapers - you have anxiety. BUT please remember, measured by square feet and population, according to FBI statistics - Israel is far safer than most major North American cities!<br>  <br>  The anxiety you feel has been provided to you by both the Palestinians and the Israeli government and media. Israel is not in a war - in the conventional sense. No missiles, no scuds, no tanks in the streets. The Palestinian's are using psychological weapons called: "Terror Attacks" - which if used properly spread terror and fear - if we allow it to spread!<br>  <br>  The Israeli government and media, in a fair and just attempt to illustrate to the world that Israel is being victimized, must show the blood. And perhaps because the Israeli government is very weak on professional public relations - finding a fair balance between the outgoing signals of being a victim and the fear attached to terror attacks is becoming very difficult.<br>  <br>  So yes - please visit Israel They have beautiful hotels, long and sandy white beaches, scuba and sailing, historic sites - skiing in the North and mountain climbing and desert safaris in the South.<br>  <br>  Hope you have a great time, and enjoy the Barmi|`|2MP9nYLdaa	at the moment it is but you can never tell from one day to the next. war over there is very unpredictable and can happen anytime. but at this stage it is safe but down the track things can and do change. God bless|`|xBfPUGqyaa	if ur detained to die, ur going to, if not, then some other time|`|0fW76gB8aa	Most of Israel, including Tel Aviv, is perfectly safe.<br>  <br>  The only areas that are unsafe are the Western Negev (which includes Sderot and Ashkelon) due to rocket fire, and any Arab cities in Judea and Samaria (why the heck would anyone want to go there anyway?). <br>  <br>  Israeli Police or the military could give you the exact information about the areas suffering from rocket fire if you are still concerned.|`|eOY9Lt7eaa	well i have neber been there but yes it is safe even when it is war because if they drop a bomo an alarm sounds and you have like 2 minutes to run to a i dont know the name and well it should be nice to go kotel and listen to the barmitsbah and mazaltob! hey don't worry it is like being in other place of the world|`|swIWHXzSaa	Of course it's safe.

AA11377935	The peace process is a joke since the Arabs will consider nothing short of riding Israel of all Jews.<br>  The good news is God has a plan of his own so no amount of politics, lies and pressure placed on Israel will change God's plan.<br>  <br>  But peace, I am afraid, will only come when Yeshua arrives.  There maybe a false peace along the way but that will be a deal with the devil and will not stand.<br>  <br>  How arrogant to suggest we "have" to teach the Jews anything.

I think the terrorists just ask to be smited if they want peace they just need to put down their weapons make a plow instead.<br>  <br>  Peace thru strength,  Israel National Flag with Shield of David and Prayer Shawl, Largest flag in the World..donated by a Christian <br>  <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/927830.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/9278...</a><br>  <br>  I think only country that needs to be involved is Israel as the internationalists don't understand extremist Islamic mindset. Just to keep Israel strong is good.<br>  <br>  I know what you are talking about but I don't think we are on same page of scripture right now. Israel is currently looking now for a lasting sustainable peace not a false peace.  We aren't settling for a false peace because we know the terrorists don't want peace.

I KNOW the Jews lived there previously but they left to make their fortunes elsewhere in the world and, when it all fell through, due to dictators like Hitler, the western world decided that due to the dreadful things done to them during the war that they owed the Jewish people a homeland but instead of giving them the benefit of parts of their own homeland, they decided to rob the Palestinians of theirs.  There will never be peace there until at least the Palestinians are given equal rights in Palestine [Israel].  That's all it takes.|`|yiEUOwK0aa	"peace" ... "israel" ... when will these words work together??<br>  <br>  I think we live very close to the end-times, when God will come to redeem the world and His people - the Jewish nation of Israel. <br>  <br>  Peace in Israel has been a greatly anticipated event over the last few decades. The nation has seen more than enough fighting, hatred and deception from every nation of the world. I think the Lord has something miraculous in store for His nation which lies in the centre of attention for people who know the bible prophecies. <br>  <br>  Who's to say when exactly?? To those who don't pay attention, the Lord''s coming will be like a thief in the night. BUT... to those who DO know where to focus their attention and who to look to in these turbulent times... the return of the Messiah (and the restoration of peace in Israel) is obvioulsy close at hand. <br>  <br>  ?? ????? ??|`|FA8jIbJNaa	Hi, I am Norwegian and just like all the advanced-civilized countries all over the World we are doing our best to teach the jews how to be peaceful and love their neighbours.<br>  It is a tough battle since they are expecting Lucifer as their Messiah, so everyone that knows any Jews must try and teach them good things.<br>  We must make them decent human beings, in order to  eliminate anti-semetics.<br>  Anti-semeticism is created by their actions.<br>  If we manage to turn these people good, all problems in the area will be in the past.<br>  bye bye<br>  <br>  Edit "Lucifer" means Light-Bringer in Jewish Old testament.
WNuxNjeOaa	Anywhere east of the city would be great. If you could possibly get on a roof or balcony of an apartment building on the east side of Cheeseman Park the view is exceptional. <br>  Park in the foreground<br>  City<br>  Mountains in the background<br>  <br>  City Park area is also good if you can get up high enough.|`|inFKnA7oaa	I was going to say Red Rocks, especially on a clear night because you can see the entire city. But for having the mountains in the background... a bit southeast from Boulder...?|`|MY6uhuU3aa	ok go to North high school. i don't  go there but i used to practice there and it has the most beautiful skyline ever. especially at night.

Medowhall (totally boring), Swimming (You pays loads to get one hour), Shopping (Boring), Ice Sheffield (Boring after a while), clubs (can't get in till 18), cinema (bad venues and best one is soooo expensive).|`|qO7nbSQVaa	Last time i was there it was bloody awfull|`|PG7WfGpHaa	If bits of it aren't rubbish, why are you knocking them down?|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	It depends on your income, if you have a lot of money then you can live anywhere, I gatherit's not that nice for the lowerclass in sheffield though

J7ZZL1bCaa	Both are great (don't listen to Jedi the master illiterate), Spain is for the lager-lout crowd... I've been to Egypt twice, to Greece, once and Crete, once. Each place has its attractions. Egypt...the pyramids, Cairo, Temples etc...and a Nile cruise are all must-dos.Greece has it's temples etc too, nice beaches and great food.<br>  It depends what you want for a holiday...if you want to get drunk, go clubbing etc...stick to Magaluf/Ibiza etc.<br>  At the moment Egypt is cheaper due to the strong Euro, the problem is that in Egypt you get hassled by people trying to sell you things.|`|8c632bd63783201a0f48bbc7b8c126f3aa	if you want to visit a historical gem than it's egypt, if you want history and to have fun it's greece....Greece is a more civilized country, i would opt greece....or else you could go on a cruise and visit both countries!!|`|6pIsnI0Saa	it depends on your own tastes and likes they are two very different countries but both very exciting specially Egypt with the pyramids<br>  but the choice is yours go where you really want to go to !|`|bDxFH1jyaa	Egypt deffo.<br>  I have been there loads of times to see my family and it is amazing!|`|wP63CsYCaa	The countries are different.<br>  <br>  Interested in sea, islands, more relaxing places....

NS9yqfT6aa	Most major rental facilities will rent to underage, but there will be an additional charge of anywhere from $15-$25/day.<br>  I've been renting cars since 22 and have never had a problem, I usually go through National, which is now part of Enterprise.  Your best bet is to call each company, their service departments are usually pretty friendly and can answer that question fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|rSq790ksaa	You just have to search around. There are many places that are willing to let 21-year-olds rent a car.
MeU2ymrVaa	Its usually a $5 minimum - higher if it is busy.|`|JLA2Wncfaa	I played $1/$2 in there last time but it was 6am on a Sunday and i had been drinking for 16 hours and I won $270 !!|`|uiX853hPaa	I believe $2-4 is their lowest limit game (ie game that isn't no-limit).
RzBNps1Laa	i've been planning to buy an electric guitar myself.  Still saving up, though. :)<br>  <br>  anyway, a few months ago, i was already searching where i can buy myself a guitar, an i found this site:<br>  <br>  www.yupangco.com<br>  <br>  their main store is in makati.  they have an extensive list of brands, but they don't have gibson (i read somewhere that they used to sell gibson but lost the rights or deal to do so).  i'm planning to buy a fender myself.<br>  <br>  brands, models, descriptions and prices are posted in the site, so it'll be easy to decide what guitar to buy.  however, i suggest that you call their stores to check if they are in stock of the model you choose to purchase, rather than going to the stores and finding out that they are still waiting for the next shipment.  if you were to pay in cash, i think that you can ask for a discount.  when i was calling around last year, they offered me one if i decided to pay in cash.  their store include perfect pitch and yamaha outlets.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|S2Wp2Vjsaa	Gonzalo Puyat (Raon) Manila or Oca St South Harbor, Port Area, if you want Japanese made.(used)|`|4b644d3e9fa1328649e31b2870d579ccaa	RJ's is the best.  RJ is Jacinto's Music Store.  You can find the at SM Malls and Robinson's
yAJUdasIaa	For 11 PM on a Saturday night, most of the main attractions will be 21+ only.  Unfortunately, that also includes the main plaza of the Power and Light District, as well as pretty much all of Westport proper.  <br>  <br>  There are a few late night all-ages shows from time to time, but you'll need to do some searching for those.  For example, once a month Rocky Horror Picture Show plays at the Screenland Crossroads, but it starts at 10.  OK, well, 10-ish.  And you will need to buy your tix in advance, as they often sell out.<br>  <br>  Though by now cliched, you can go for a stroll around the Country Club Plaza, or perhaps a carriage ride through the same.  The bars there are 21+, but there's a lot of beautiful outdoor statues and fountains.|`|e4bdde907ad0f384d0c1920972660062aa	With him being only 20 it definitely puts some limits on what's possible, but that Skies idea's a good one. There you have some great views of the city. I don't know, but you could check out the Power and Light District. Maybe (admittedly I don't know for sure), there are some places that are 18+.|`|AN2sMalmaa	You said you had dinner picked out, but Skies restaurant is AWESOME. I took my husband on a surprise trip there a few years ago for his birthday (had the whole trip planned out down to meals and everything) and took him there. Not only is it romantic (you really don't see anyone else the way that the tables are arranged), but you get to see the skyline at night, there's not an age limit and it will take some time (it makes one full circle in one hour)... we were there for about 90 minutes.   It makes for a really nice and romantic night.
Twzg9s0caa	I would say it has to be 2500 kilometers from Banff to Toronto, at least! That could get costly.
3K1QW7Oeaa	Texas is cheaper and better than California!|`|0fd4023533dd0a61838399a036b4147baa	political correctness is more of an issue in CA
rVUvopaLaa	just want to clarify your question is it Manila or Metro Manila?  <br>  <br>  if Manila <br>  entertainment within the areas of Malate, Greenhills (San Juan, Manila) and Ermita.  <br>  <br>  shopping try the robinsons Ermita, harizon plaza, greenhills, SM city hall, for cheap retailers or flea markets try divisoria, tutuban centre and  quiapo <br>  <br>  for theatre try the cultural centre of the phils.<br>  <br>  festivities every june 24th araw ng maynila (Manila day).  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|VGMFkcziaa	March til May is summer time. Nice to go to beaches or baguio if you wanna go for a cold place.. <br>  <br>  Try tagaytay or subic for beaches. or if you wanna go shopiing go to Makati so many shopping malls there or in Mall of Asia in Manila..also Ortigas and Greenhills.
