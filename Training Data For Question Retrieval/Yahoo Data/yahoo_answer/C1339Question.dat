I told my 2 friends they could live with me and sleep in my aunts room, then there was my neighboor, who is a little girl that was staying with me too. I remember thinking that I had to build three more rooms in my house because more little kids was gonna move in and let me take care of them. All together there was about 10 people in my house who i was taking care of. Why would I have this dream?      Also: I havent played my Sims 2 in about a year or maybe more. I havent even thought about it.

Passi davanti alla fermata di un autobus e vedi tre persone che lo stanno aspettando.   1. Un'anziana signora che sembra sul punto di morire.   2. Un vecchio amico che una volta ti ha salvato la vita.   3. La donna (o uomo) dei tuoi sogni, la tua anima gemella.   Nella tua auto c'e' posto solo per una persona e tu non puoi tornare alla fermata dell'autobus una volta che te ne sei allontanato (non si sa perche' ma e' cosi'). A chi offri un passaggio? Pensaci bene prima di rispondere. Questo quesito e' stato usato da importanti societa' di selezione per decidere chi assumere. Non sparare una risposta a caso, ma pensaci... Potrebbe essere un quesito interessante...   a) Potresti dare un passaggio all'anziana signora e salvarle la vita   b) Potresti dare un passaggio al tuo vecchio amico e ricambiargli cosi' il favore   c) Ma d'altro canto potresti non ritrovare mai piu' la tua anima gemella.

20081017141805AA3idYE	Social Science;Sociology	Uff non lo sopporto +!?	C'è un ragazzo che da come ho capito ci prova con tutte e lui mi piace un pò...   Mi dice sempre che mi ama, e vuole sempre stare al centro dell'attenzione con me...   So che lo fa con tante altre, e si capisce dal fatto che appena gli ho presentato una mia amica molto carina, lui subito ci ha provato. Ma lei purtroppo è fidanzata, e lui ha lasciato perdere. Questo lo fa con ogni ragazza che incontra secondo me. Ma perchè lo fa anche con me?!?   A me piace un pò, anche se non cedo a tutto quello che mi dice perchè non voglio essere una delle tante, vorrei farglielo capire...ma non so come. Lui mi tratta come tutte, proprio ora mi sta torturando su msn dicendo che mi ama, che ha voglia di me e tutte cose così, ma si capisce che lo fa per scherzare, convinto che facendo in questo modo conquisterebbe la mia attenzione ancora di +.   Io non gli ho mai detto che mi piace seriamente...scherzo come fa lui a volte...   Lui mi prende in giro, io faccio lo stesso con lui.   Non so che fare...potrei lasciar perdere...Ma lui mi attira tanto.   Che cosa lo spinge, secondo voi a comportarsi in un certo modo con tutte??   Sarà insicurezza?? Avevo fatto una domanda così precedentemente e alcuni mi avevano risposto che era x questo...ma io non riesco a capire...insicurezza...poi di che?!?

I'm not exactly yelling, and I'm not using expletives, but rather I am speaking loudly and passionately. I also get the feeling that my oratory is so impressive that it people in the room can feel it.      Does this mean anything? I don't recall ever behaving this way in real life.

My great-grandfather died, in my presence, and my two best friends turned on me. Both memories are so vivid it hurts.       For years afterwords I struggled with a lot of mental problems, my parents knew and tried to help me, but they never took me too see anyone or put me on anything.      Now whenever I'm hurt emotionally those old scars reopen. The feelings of not be accepted and being rejected, of making mistakes and never fixing them, of helplessness. I can't seem to get past it.      I have major trust issues and don't let anyone get to close, but sometimes it happens and I shut those people out and they leave me. I end up hurting worse then before.      So please, if you have any advice, please help me. 
20090205005645AA88Wy9	Social Science;Sociology	Do Asians in Asia see each other as Asians?	Ok, first off, I'm an Asian that was born in America.  As a result, I was socialized to view things through a white person's point of view.  An interesting thing I found out about this is that, whenever I see a random white person on the street, the first thing my brain does is look at physical traits like beauty, facial shape, etc... - the issue of skin color does NOT come into mind.      However, whenever I look at a ethnic person like black, Asian, Hispanic, etc.. the first thing that comes into mind is their race and skin color.  And then I worry about other physical traits.      My question is - If I were born in Asia and socialized in Asia, when I view another Asian person, would I think about skin color first or would I look at other physical traits first?

In giro si vedono tanti ragazzi e uomini che con questa temperatura da forno, per loro motivi di look da ufficio, o di rappresentanza, girano impeccabili "giacca e cravatta"   Capisco che l'immagine da ufficio o manageriale, ne chiede l'uso, però non pensate che sia ora di modificare un po' questa regola?   Credo che sia più giusto adattare la propria immagine, in base alle temperature attuali.   Sappiamo che con l'effetto serra, la temperatura terrestre è salita tantissimo, e in questi periodi roventi, non capisco come facciano tanti a stringersi il colletto della camicia con la cravatta, e poi mettere una giacca.   In ufficio hanno il climatizzatore, ma per le strade,no.   Secondo me, sarebbe ora di cambiare look e di eliminare questa usanza e cambiarla con una più elastica, e meno marziale.

See a couple of weeks ago, my dad sent me, my brother, and our friends on a vacation, (he wanted to talk with his colleagues without anyone else around) he sent us to this beach we always used to go to when i was probably 3 years old. And my brother was like 5. We have a house at this place, and haven't been over in years. Not since my mother left us when I was 8. I'm 14 now, by the way.    Anyway, after a while when we got there, we decided to go to the beach, and i noticed that my friend, Chloe was getting all the attention of the boys. I took out all my anger in a game of Volleyball, as always I had to win, because almost isn't good enough. Well, anyway, we won. And after a little while these 2 boys came up to us, and invited Chloe and my other friend, Emma to a party they were having that same evening. Apparently they were "big-shots" in the city because they obviously had no idea who me and my brother were. (Our name is very well known and respected in our city) But I didn't tell them, I guess I was intrigued, I was so used to people almost worshipping me and I guess I wanted to know what it's like to get a clean slate. Anyway, I kinda invited myself to their party. And I overheard the boy say to someone they'd be partying from dusk 'til dawn. So we, being as punctual as we are, arrived at dusk exactly. I learned that it was just an experession, but of course, never admit to a mistake. So we simply waited it out until everyone else arrived. And at the party, Chloe was still getting every boys attention, she almost literally had to fight them off. And after she ditched them, she came to find me, and thanked me for being there when all those boys wouldn't leave her alone because "they all like [her] too much." I kinda lost it after that, but nothing bad, I just said those boys liked her because she was a tease, not a challenge, like me. After, I felt bad and pologized saying I was a little jealous. She was shocked, and called me what everyone else does, "the most beautiful, smartest, most perfect girl in the world."   I said, "Well, you're right. But whenever I meet boys they act like I'm going to do something horrible to them" And she said, "their probly just intimidated." And she gave me some tips on how to make a boy like me. I tried it on the host, and for a moment it worked. We even kissed for like a split-second. But then, I kinda ruined it. And afterwards my  older brother kinda lost his temper too, because of girlfriend issues. And we all left with him. And spent a night on the beach talking about all those yeas ago when everything seemed so different. And we ended up talking all about ourselves. All except for me, but that's different. I don't have sob stories like all of them. I mean, I could complain how my mom like my brother more than me, but I don't really care. My own mother thought I was a monster. She was right of course, but it still hurt. Well, anyway after a while we decided to make the trip really memorable, and trashed the party. I t was really fun, but now I can't elp but think, is there something wrong with me? I've always been the best at everything, and won't settle for anything less. So with school, and extra curricular activites, and Religion lessons, etc. i guess I never had time to socialize with boys. Only my 3 best friends. Do I sound okay to you? Do you think there's anything I could change? Do you have any comments on the story? Please tell me. Thanks.

I have school but i find it challenging i get cc plus and a B higher which is not good but okay. I am not athletic i suck with soccer basketball etc. but most importantly my mom puts to much pressure on me with school. I want to become successful but i don't no what to do in the future. I want millions of dollars but to do that you need a business right so i decided to look into business and i don't know which one to start even though my mom doesn't say it i can tell she thinks of me as a loser she loves me so much she encourages me but i think she does put me in too much stress i mean in two years i don't want to be kick out on the streets. I study day and night i am getting a tutor but i still get okay grades.my mom and dad asked this guru (I know its lame)believe about my future and he said i will make so much money me on the other hand don't believe that one bit so in other words my question is that is their hope for me ?

20090204214156AAguAkl	Social Science;Psychology	How do you find passion in life?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

20090204224917AA5VAO7	Social Science;Psychology	Why do I worry so much about my job loss?	I'm going to quit my job. I feel a little upset now. I worry about my finance. Maybe I need to convince myself that I really don't need to worry too much. I can speak Good English.I can find a job, although jobs are scarce, but they still exist. Plus, I have a saving account that I help me get through a long time, say, one year. I can even ask my family for help. They have much more money than me, so I really don't need to worry.I can use this precious time to read many books to improve myself, to add my skills because the opportunity cost is so low. And I am not alone. There are so many people out there who have no job, but they are still living. So many people out there who don't have excellent skills as me.  So I am wondering why I worried so much about my job loss? Maybe it is human's nature. Human being likes to worry. It is their nature. Give me your opinion. Please convince me that I really don't need to worry. Thank you!!! ^-^

20090204225117AAU9L2x	Social Science;Psychology	Do you think humans want to feel what they can't already feel?	Support your opinion with an actual source if you can. Not a source like your brain, but one like a book or a internet website.   To be more specific:   Do you think people in America watch the news about killing, watch tv shows and movies about killing (CSI shows) and play video games about killing because it satisfies what Americans do not truly feel?      This next statement is true fact: the American people do not face true suffering or killing in America unlike other countries, and so we enjoy watching these things because it satisfies what we don't feel. Why do we love to see those movies like The Dark Night or X men or even the Saw movies, they all have killing, don't they?   Think of it backwards...if you are over in countries that are suffering, would you want to see more suffering and action movies, or would you rather see something that can lift your spirit such as a family in poverty that turns their lives around.      Please dont bag on people just 'cause they have a different opinion

The past few days I keep waking up and all I hear is this sound(the best way I can describe it is that it sounds like static) and I can't move.   About 20 minutes ago I woke up and the same thing happened; I don't know why, but I felt like someone was in my room trying to get me and I was freaking out trying to get out of my bed.      Also the amount of sleep I get now is a lot more than normal.  I usually get about 7-8 hours each night, and at school I will just fall asleep no matter how hard I try to stay awake.  Then when I get home I take a two or three hour nap.      Why is all this stuff happening now?
20090204224151AAQ6mzZ	Social Science;Psychology	If he said he doesn't think he can be my boyfriend because he is super busy, is he dumping me?	We are now having a very difficult period. We had a cold war for a week and he broke the ice last week. He said he likes me and not ending things. But now he dodges all my calls and only answered my texts selectively. I suspected that he was mad at me because i didnt put out the last time we made out (because he knew how i lost my virginity to a player just a few months ago and may feel that his ego is hurt when i didnt put out. Do you think its the reason? ).       I know hes not lying about the super busy part because i know what duties he has at school. But I told him I am not a needy girlfriend that needs to be with him 24/7. I sometimes believe in platonic love. As long as we can hear each other's voice every morning or night, know how each other's doing, I don't mind if my boyfriend can't have meals with me. But now, I think I am worse than a passerby to him.       I know that him dodging calls is a big red flag. And we technically only dated for 2 days before we had the cold war, though we had been through a lot already before dating.      I asked him many times if he wants me to leave him or is he breaking up with me, but he either said he don't know or no comment.

I was going to a concert to go and see Pink. It was me, my mum, dad and little sister and we went out the front door. I was wondering were my Auntie and cousin where because they were supposed to be coming with us. So I asked my mum and she told me they were stuck in traffic.      Anyway, we ended up around the corner and because it had been snowing there were snowmen everywhere but there was smoke coming from them. (STRANGE!?)      Well, we ended up screaming (my sister and me) and ended up with us in a friend of mine, his front garden. His mum opened the door so my family goes in and I see my "Friend" and I hug him and sit on his knee. We are talking and I can't stop crying and hugging him. Then, I wake up. (DAMN, I liked that dream, I was getting in to it lol)      I have no idea what this could mean but in some cases this is true. First, I am going to a concert in June. Second, it has been snowing recently were I live. Third, I have this friend, we did kiss but haven't seen him since December last year. So do you think it could have a meaning or do you think it is just because I miss this friend?

Alright, I thought I had your common cold, but this night, earlier, I started getting drowsy, head started hurting, runny nose, and a slight cough. At that point I thought I had a sinus cold. But then I went to bed, and an hour later, I randomly woke up, my head feeling very different, sort of light headed, and it took about 15 seconds to clear up. My cough was then weaker, and I had coughed hard to see if that would work and it cleared it up a little, and my nose is getting stuffed again. This all really doesn't worry me, but waking up with that feeling running through my head gave me a scare. This is the first night that feeling had taken place. Any ideas? Is it just from being drowsy, and having a stuffed up head that caused this light headiness? Please give me an answer.

Now, feminists like talking about some mythical indian society, but that was pretty debunked as the result of a feminist researcher fitting the data to the ideas.    If all these societies-monotheistic and polytheistic, omnivorous, vegetarian and cannibalistic, sedentary and nomadic-are patriachial, (yet they disagree on other basic ideas), is it a conspiracy?    Besides, if gender is socially constructed, why this particular construct? If there is a strong patriachial trend, perhaps it's not so arbitrary.

Hopefully someone out there has a shoulder for me to lean on here lol-(this is kind of long so if you are ready to read this and have a headache afterwards be my guest ;-p lol)....      i have been jobless for a while now, mainly because it has been hard to find a job and i have a record. i am not placing limitations on myself but it is basically a hard situation to deal with, on top of it i have been driving my car around with no car insurance and an expired tag. just recently i was driving my boyfriend's car (not that it makes a difference but i am gay so i do have a boyfriend, whenever you see 'my boyfreind' here after you'd understand that its not a mistake) and he had a headlight that was out. so a police officer stopped us, asked for my license and low and behold my license is suspended and i failed to let him know beforehand (mainly because i just didn't think to tell him- nervousness). so i was hauled out to jail, spent several hours in jail and my boyfriend bailed me out.      i had hope for a while there, (despite my night in jail), i had applied for this job and i was starting this week. so i get a call from my job and they told me not to come in because i have a record (i was caught stealing twice, have two retail theft charges this was last year and when i was 18) think i'd learn my lesson, obviously i didn't. i had to reap my own consequences. so you'd think i learn my lesson with the licensee thing, so i also go to college, and the only way i could go to school is by driving my uninsured car, so guess what happens to me? i was stopped on my way home from school and i got three more tickets (added on to the 6 i already have accumulated and can't pay for since i haven't worked in i don't know how long). so my car gets towed and i end up walking to my house, to come home to a boyfriend who is my complete opposite. he has his stuff taken care of, he has a job and is doing well in school so you can imagine our arguements he's the perfect one and i am the f8ck up and i am doing everythign wrong 9which i am) and he's doing everything right.      our fights are horrible, he just walked out on me in the middle of an argument (he's stressed out too the day i was caught driving without my license he was caught with possession of paraphenelia and i feel like its my fault because im the outlaw and he's the perfect one and he wouldn not have a ticket if it wasn't for me, so i tried taking the blaim for it but the police officer wouldnt let me) so anyways,      this situation is sooooooo bad and i have no clue what to do with myself, have to look for antoehr job without my car, having my boyfreind thinking i don't knwo what about me-      afterall i am not a bad person i have just made some awful, stupid adn ignorant choices in my life and i don't want to affect him. i love him with all my heart and i knwo i am stressing him out plus if anyone is into the zodiac i am a leo he is a gemini so you can imagine how our arguments are.   anyways just needed to release this tension held deep inside.cause right now i am awake, alone, my boyfriend is i don't know where... if i went into our relationship that is another novel lol so i wont go there.      just needed to vent for a sec. thanks for listening :-) if anyone finished reading this than thank you and if you respond than thank you for responding as well.

20090205000430AAzQ3oR	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Are rape laws being abused?	I was reading in the paper today about this case. This guy and a woman are at some party. They both get a bit drunk and end up having sex. Then like 2 weeks later the woman goes to the cops and says she was raped that night. The guy was arrested and just sentenced to 10 years in jail.      I think that's bullcrap. If you make the arguement that the woman can't consent to the act while being drunk, couldn't you also claim the guy couldn't consent either if he's drunk?      And what's with the 2 weeks to report it? Sounds like she just changed her mind.

To make a long story short, he abruptly initiated 100% no contact on me. He wont return my voicemail or respond to my texts and emails when he use to call me every single day several times a day.      What should I do?   To tell you the truth I'm pissed that he would treat me this way, and if he tries to contact me months later I will let him have it.

20090204230827AAX4keL	Social Science;Psychology	What is wrong with me am I autistic or crazy?	Okay supposedly people like me and women are attracted to me but I hate myself.  I felt alright dispite having low self esteem and being unable to connect to people I was happy.  Then I got in a situation where I was bullied day in and day out for around 2 years.  Since then its like they knocked the sense out of me.  I cannot seem to center myself. I dont trust anyone and cant seem to be able to read who are the safe people and who are the crazy ones because now Im one of the people I used to look at and think they were nuts.  I honestly think I might be autistic of have aspergers disorder.  I am socially inept.  Sometimes when I let the real me out people think I'm a jerk. So I am stuck hiding who I am and my low self esteem causes me tons of problems.  What is funny is that I guess some women like me and people think I am cool but I have such horrible self esteem and I feel so socially inept and having trouble connnecting to other people that I sometimes will isolate myself then people will lash out on me because they think that I think I am stuck up but in reality I am just an extremely shelter kid who had a crappy family and I am really hurt by being bullied really badly.  I am honestly thinking about seeking professional help.  Can someone give me any guidance on my feelings.  What is the most scary to me is that I read about the Virginia Tech massacure shooter and how he felt leading up to the shooting is similair to how I feel.  As I child I would go home and cry because I had such bad problems in social situations it killed me on the inside but I guess that people just wanted to get to know me.  To this day I still have MAJOR problems socializing.  The only thing I want to feel normal and because able to function in society.

I'm sure you've listened to music before and felt certain emotions from the song, sometimes the words influence or inspire you too right? Now what I'm trying to think of is if music can do these things without you being aware of it. I want to know if anyone has the actual science explaining it though. Like some sort of sensory overload that would then leave the mind open to intake.

First of all, if a girl was really silent while her boyfriend and her were making out and not willing to initiate kisses (even when requested by her boyfriend) and only kissed him when he initiated, and seemed shocked when her boyfriend touched her breast and quickly fixed her bra after that, do these count as not willing to put out? Does a guy mean he wants to have sex if he carries his gf to his bed, keeps looking at her, keeps kissing and hugging her, feels her breast and caress her waist?      And the reason they are reluctant to admit that...:      Is it because they think their ego is hurt when their gf won't put out?      And is it because they think admitting that would make them come off as jerks?      Will they be even angrier if they know their girlfriends are not even virgins but still won't put out for them? (Because to them it sounds like their gfs were willing to put out for other guys in the past but not to them now??)      I'm guessing if my bf is breaking up with me because of this.       I'm having mental breakdown with all the mind games he's playing with me.

20090205001336AA2WC7Y	Social Science;Psychology	How do you find motivation to wake up and work each day?	How do you get the motivation to wake up early every morning and go to work or school and try hard to be good at whatever you do? When I woke up every morning, usually i would have to take a few minutes to fight off the unmotivated and slacking side of me which strongly tempted me to go back to bed. Sometimes, it got the better of me and I just turned off the alarm and go back to sleep like i never woke up. I mean, how do find the REAL motivation, not just because someone forces you to do it or you worry about the consequences ( i think these kinds of motivation cannot keep you going on a long way anyway). For example, how do you find a strong enough motivation to wake up early and start to work on a weekend/Sunday morning. You see, you can relax on a Sunday morning (and of course you should sometimes) but this shows that you really want to work because you are motivated (why and how i don't and am asking), not just because of some obligation.       Moreover, think about another situation: this motivation, whatever it is that is motivating you, does it have its expiration, and if somehow you don't have it anymore, would you be able to find another motivation and go on? or you would be devastated and cease to function because you have lost the only biggest meaning of your life?       Thank you for your time and answer and good luck to you!

The Third World War is already underway without me. The fuse of the third world war is the war in the Taiwan Strait in February 2008.   8.11   A multitude of people will appear at Vicenza    without force, fire to burn the Basilica.    Near Luna age, the great one of Valenza defeated:    at a time when Venice takes up the quarrel through custom.       I want to be the new Nero, I want to do away with the Royal Family of English and the Vatican. Nuns and monks will be able to get married. According to the prophecy, I will be the coming of the great legislator. According to "He will hurl back the Celts very far", you will not lose your job. According to "The new sage with a lone brain sees it", I will be the only one who can able to solve the Economic Crisis.      1727+"the great seventh number’s revolution"=the year of birth I returned. What is "Esdras II" ?   "Secondary Scripture"("Deuterocanon"), "Esdras II"    http://christianity.wikia.com/wiki/Deute...       Jesus was born in April and I was born on 25 December, 4 January 1643 is Thursday. I was born and returned on Thursday. According to "the Hebrew Bible", the day of birth I returned can be calculated.   10.74   The great seventh number’s revolution,   It will appear a time of the year for hecatomb.   Not far from the great millennial age,   When those can enter will leave the tomb.   1.50   From the three water signs will be born a man，   who will celebrate Thursday as his holiday.    His renown, praise, rule and power will grow，   on land and sea, bringing trouble to the East.      This is evidence, If you can speak Chinese, you will not doubt my identity.    http://groups.google.com/group/the-divin...

China will soon implement the two-party system.   3.4   When they will be close the lunar ones will fail,    From one another not greatly distant,    Cold, dryness, danger towards the frontiers,    Even where the oracle has had its beginning.      Because of the Third World War, end of the world in 2017. Why I return as the Messiah in China? The fuse of the third world war is the war in the Taiwan Strait in February 2008. I just want to tell you, there is a great plague coming, more than two thirds of humanity will be died. The upcoming terrorist deal with a major disaster. So I spam again and again.   2.46   After great trouble for humanity, a greater one is prepared,   The Great Mover renews the ages.   Rain, blood, milk, famine, steel and plague,   Is the heavens fire seen, a long spark running.   5.32   Where all is good, the Sun all beneficial and the Moon    Is abundant, its ruin approaches:    From the sky it advances to change your fortune.    In the same state as the seventh rock.   10.42   The humane realm of Angelican offspring,   It will cause its realm to hold to peace and union.   War half-captive in its enclosure,   For long will it cause them to maintain peace.   3.92   The world near the last period，   Saturn will come back again late.    Empire transferred towards the Dusky nation，   The eye plucked out by the Goshawk at Narbonne.   2.41   The great star will burn for seven days,    The cloud will cause two suns to appear:    The big mastiff will howl all night    When the great pontiff will change country.      The last time spam. I am Isaac Newton. I will appear in Jerusalem. According to "the Hebrew Bible", my date of birth can be calculated. I am a hero. I will tell you what is "Armageddon". I think that Chinese people like dogs. I will take the yellow people and the black people into concentration camps. When you see me, I will make you feel speechless. I will take Barack Obama and Condoleezza Rice into concentration camps, I think that the black people and Latinos like dogs.   1.50   From the three water signs will be born a man，   who will celebrate Thursday as his holiday.    His renown, praise, rule and power will grow，   on land and sea, bringing trouble to the East.   4.99   The valiant elder son of the King’s daughter，   He will hurl back the Celts very far.   Such that he will cast thunderbolts, so many in such an array，    Few and distant, then deep into the Hesperias.    3.60   Throughout all Asia great proscription,    Even in Mysia, Lycia and Pamphilia.    Blood will be shed because of the absolution    Of a young evil one filled with felony.

You dont dserve her love she is most probably laughing about you behind your back as thats all you f cking deserve you p ick."      Lately I've started slapping myself across the face and spitting into my hand and wiping it on me - I just dont care anymore I despise myself there are other stronger words I could use but why bother who gives a damn anymore not I.      I thought she was different obviously she distanced herself because of her feelings - did I ask her to come on to me seeing shes unhappily married? No? Seems like I'm the f cking reject people come to when they have problems.      Oh heres Richard hes a piece of sh!t lets use him hes a p ick.

This guy who I sit with in class in college always seems to talk really loud when this other guy is around and waiting for class to start. he starts talking about his girlfriend really loud, and he leans in to me during class to tell me stuff when this other guy is around.....it's so odd & is creepy!       I don't like him but I am thinking this guy I sit with feels threatened by the other guy or he is gay and trying to hide it??? Or I am being used for a game play??      What do you think??
20090205033226AAALnyh	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why is it that the concern of 'physical attraction' or 'emotional attachment' never brought up when women..?	.. are using sex in exchange for money and other forms of social influence? Why don't you hear women ~ever~ concern themselves: "ahh, you know i'd love to do it, but I just can't get myself to have sex with guys I'm not attracted to or emotionally attached with."? Is this only a valid concern of women as long as they don't have the allure of money & other S.I.? It sure appears that way.       Does women's attraction to money/S.I. subvert any concern over 'love' or physical attraction, or emotional attachment that women seem to have in mainstream society?

20090205033306AArXhTZ	Social Science;Psychology	I feel like a loser!!?	I had never noticed this before, but sometimes I jerk my head to the side a little.. Not sharply though.       I only knew today because I was lining up for the school canteen and I heard some girls talking about me. One of them was like "Ew what a retard, she jerks her head to the side occasionally! Wait for it.... Oh yeap, there she goes again! She just did it."      It made me feel so insecure about myself afterwards.   I don't know how to make myself feel better.      What are some of your strategies to build up your self esteem after you've heard mean things said about you?      Please I need help.
20090205043029AAZLiDN	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Feminists themselves admit that rape is an underreported crime out of?	shame many women do not report the crime, yet on the other hand, women who want to falsely accuse their boyfriend/lover of such a crime do not have such shame and are only too willing to press charges based on a lie.    How come feminists can not understand that the percentage of false reports are, for rape, high, very very very high, due to the above combination ?    Why are feminists not willing to accept that we live in a false rape society or doing anything to fight the falserape phenomenon, to take pressure away from real victims of rape ?    And why do feminists disregard any evidence that the number of false rape charges is high, claiming instead that the problem is not the not guilty being set free, but the low conviction rates of accusations based on lies ?
20090205033018AAdK1iT	Social Science;Psychology	I have no direction in life, and frankly, I just dont see the point of it; Perhaps someone can assist me?	Okay so currently at school, I am doing the subjects that if passed well, I'd have every option at university available to me; so I don't have any options closed as of now. I am almost 17 years old, don't particularly enjoy ANYTHING to the extent of it giving me any motivation in life, and thus at school I have no motivation to do well enough to get into university. I look at my parents, my mother went to university, my father didn't; all I see is that they work and work to no avail, I don't see a point in working my *** off for the final year of school, then perhaps taking up a course at university that I don't particularly enjoy, and then working the rest of my life and finally dieing. It just sounds so pointless.    Perhaps someone can give me an INSIGHTFUL answer as to how I can become sane once again, and perhaps tell me what makes you enjoy life, what makes you want to keep on living...    Thanks.
20090205021035AAGSwK1	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do some men think that it is acceptable to rape women?	Or that any woman who reports rape is automatically lying? I hope that people with these beliefs were in the vast minority, however I have noticed recently on GWS whenever the word "rape" is mentioned there is a certain type of user who is quick to point out how many men have been falsely accused of rape (I agree that a false allegation of rape is just plain WRONG,) or that feminists regard all men as rapists. Not once have I seen them express sympathy for a woman who has been raped.    Do these men lack respect or compassion for the victims/survivors of rape?
20090205034105AAe8mjP	Social Science;Psychology	How to stop being lustful?	I just think about my ex all the time in a really lustfull way. I am so glad I am not with her otherwise because our relationship was a desaster but I can't stop thinking about her sexually. I can't fall asleep at nights. I also look at attractive people in a very sexual way. I don't like it. How can I stop it and focus on people's minds than bodies?    fyi...I am a woman.

20090205021236AAmEzwp	Social Science;Economics	Does inflation stack?	there's this problem in a quiz, it said "5 % inflation per year over the life of the project". the project lasts 5 years. so does that mean the first year has 5% inflation, then 2nd year has 10%, and so on? or does it mean consistent 5% all throughout?
20090205023514AA1X9pj	Social Science;Sociology	Views on Modern Racism and Sexism?	The past few months have been intolerable for me.  I have no patience for racism, sexism, and the works.  I leave prejudice out because I feel that is mainly religion, which I do not accept the idea of at all and consider an ill of humanity.       One thing that bothers me is the labeling of people as White and Black.  I feel it is racist in itself to use those terms.  There are plenty of different races of light skinned people and also many different races of darker skinned people.      It also seems to me, if a racist dark skinned person has an issue with a job, or something similar, they automatically assume it is because of their skin color.  This same thing applies I believe to sexist women.  I believe everyone should be equal, however what I see are the people trying to gain certain equality seemingly to be wanting to be above the others.  Reverse discrimination also plagues the U.S.A.  I am a light skinned male and have been victimized by this.  I don't hold rallies, I don't post posters, I don't sue, as if I would get anywhere.  So I came to the conclusion what all these groups want are a communist system, where everyone gets paid equal, generally, and their equality is forced through the government.  However, these same people generally don't accept the idea and think it is bad because of the propaganda against it.  Anyways, you all tell me what you think.

20090205031540AAGisIk	Social Science;Psychology	Is this anxiety or something else?	I'm not sure if 'mental illness' would be the correct term or not though.      I'm trying to help my friend out. So she knows she used to be depressed but she thought it had went away.   But I've noticed things she probably doesn't... and she's also started to notice some things.      She really overly fears bad things happening. To the point where she won't even talk about some things... or if someone kids around about something she will freak out.   Sometimes it will even make her cry thinking about these things that she's worried about happening.      I don't know if this can be directly related but i hear sometimes they can be... she gets light headed sometimes.      What type of 'mental illness' could this be? And do you think just talking with someone (like maybe if I got her to open up more) would help, or should she maybe talk to a professional if I could talk her into it?      She's also been pretty stressed out lately with a lot of things going on. College. Work... family issues.... (the normal things people get stressed out about) and I notice it's a lot worse when she is stressed         so yeah.. input?
20090205024708AAJXiRN	Social Science;Psychology	Are you feeling optimistic about the future?	Society seems completely broken. The economy is sliding and even if it picks up, it will fail again like night follows day.   We are running out of time for global warming, some scientists are already saying it's too late and we should cut our losses.   Peak oil, peak water.   Western developed countries are still blaming "immigrants" for their problems.   Money is enslaving the world with noone even noticing.

20090205024353AAzD9b2	Social Science;Psychology	Love, whats the point?	Love makes you feel amazing, makes everything in life magical...when its good...      Then when it's bad it tears you apart, makes everything in life so pointless and crap, but anchors you here...so u can't move.      I want it all to end but that one emotion that made me feel this way in the first place anchors me here, rendering me incapable to end it, due to my love of my best friend, my love of others and never wanting to upset anyone, but also rendering me incapable of moving on, ending the relationships which make me feel amazing and awful, severing the ties that drag me down, dependent on that person for happiness when everything else in life is so wrong but when they're no longer there, whats the point?

20090205023743AABVNaG	Social Science;Psychology	I think I found out why I have a bad habit, so now what?	Hi there. I notice that every so often, I decide to swallow. By swallow, I just mean swallow whatever syliva or spit is in my mouth. The mental activity that goes inside my head doesn't have anything better to do at one point so it shifts my focus on what is specifically in my mouth and notices that there is spit in there. My mouth basically moves around and makes spit and freezes myself sort of until I swallow. My way of fixing it is to drink stuff so it isn't a habit at the same time. However when I am literally focused on something, my mind is definitely off of the swallowing.      I understand what to do to solve it, but not all the time do I at every single second have something to mentally focus on. It is overkill and I will only get distracted by excessive swallowing if I try to focus on something. What should I do? I really don't want to swallow anymore as this hurts me alot.
20090205033153AAuHY0d	Social Science;Psychology	DO YOU BELIEVE IN GHOST?  HAVE YOU EVER MET A GHOST AND YOUR EXPERIENCE?  SEE MORE. TKS?	Countries like India,China,  and in fact, many, many more, believe in ghost.  Have anybody ever met such a situation and please give your details as to where did you meet and how?  Is there any second life when one departs from this earth planet?  No doubt, many researches have been made and many more are under study but I feel (though I am not 100% sure) there still is not any confirmed or concrete result on this issue.  I will like to hear your stories and if you have any video clips, I will be glad to see and understand more the reality.  Mostly, people are afraid of ghosts at night and why?   Do you have any OUT OF BODY experience,  I will love to hear from you. If you have any website relating to ghosts, out of body experience and such other, please let me know.  Thanks a lot.

20090205030709AAe7IT9	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can you interpret my strange dream?	Okay, I had the weirdest dream last night.  Can you interpret it?:      I was at my friend's house and we did it in the basement.  Mind you, my friend is a girl, and so am I. So I have no idea how we cold have done that.  Maybe it wasn't really her, but a guy who resembled her.      Next thing, I'm at my high school and I'm pregnant (only a few weeks). I have my mommom's xbox and I see some guy's name is on it.  I start to think I was raped. (I don't know why.. I just do)      Then I go home to see my twin girls on my bed.  They're happy to see me and they're no longer babies (I must have missed that). They look like they're my little sister's age, about four.  They talk to me, but I forget what they said.      I go back to school and I think I find out who raped me, but I'm not sure. A guy my age comes up to me and tries to help me figure it out, then a few more guys (all my age) come and then there's six of them getting into uniform to help me get passed someone in the next room (it's somehow going to help).  Someone brings a large boxlike cart for me to hide in. At this point I feel great love for these guys and their willingness to help me -- I hardly know them.      And then a teacher comes over the loud speaker and we're having a surprise field trip -- some of the guys push me in the cart. And then, I'm there at some lake.      One of the guys takes off his shirt and grabs my hand.  I follow him into the water as he swims, never letting go.  He swims over to his friends and I just sit there.  They talk and I zone out.  I see my mom and mommom across the lake, so I walk around to get to them, hoping they have my twins.  My mommom is making shirts for a charity and my mom goes away off somewhere.  My girls aren't there.      -----      Okay. I don't exactly know what this means.  I'm only sixteen, I've never had sx and I don't have any guy friends.  Do you know what my dream might be telling me? I'm just curious. Thanks!
