Well, some people said that Kobe is the best player in the NBA because he's the best offensive player since Wilt. Does being a great scorer makes you overall better than anyone in the NBA? Was Wilt Chamberlain a better overall player than MJ just because he was an offensive nightmare?  I really don't know why some of you Lakers fans/ Kobe jockers are so biased. I understand that being a great scorer means that you're gifted and talented, but that doesn't mean you're overall better than some other players just because you're better offensively..

20090202204559AAdWT6r	Sports;Baseball	If Manny Ramirez ended up a Blue Jay, would the AL East by a 4 team deadlock?	They were 86-76 last season. They've got a pretty good team nucleus. In '07, they won 83 games. In '06, they won 87 games. They haven't won less than 80 games since '05. Honestly, this reminds me of the trend the Phillies had prior to winning the division in '07 and than the WS in '08. They never ended up with less than 80 wins in between '01 & '06 and had some really good years. That's a 6 year span of coming close to the postseason, but missing out. Right now, the Blue Jays have had 4 straight decent years. A couple more and maybe they'll be due for another title.      Financially speaking, we all know the Blue Jays aren't there. But if the possibility opens up to a one year deal, you never know. Maybe the Jays would look to move a higher salary or two. I know losing Burnett will hurt, especially considering he's stayed in the division, but they've still got some depth. An 86 win team with AJ may turn into an 81 game, but with Manny, they can arguably turn into like a 90-95 win team, which may be enough to get them in the postseason. The competition in the AL East, with or without Manny, is pretty fierce. But this extra edge would probably give them a boost, just like it did the Dodgers last season. With Manny as a Blue Jay, or sadly even without, you'd have to feel bad for Orioles fans. Especially with how blunt Kevin Millar said they don't have a chance to win this year.

He claims, hey, I'm just a dumb 23 year old who put myself in a bad position, by taking a bong hit of pot. The thing is, I'm not even against pot, I think it should be legalized. What I'm against is that we are in a major recession, and this jerk, Olympic Swimming great Michael Phelps, who is making MILLIONS in endorsements from Speedo, Wheaties, everything you can think of, is at some party, taking a bong hit of an ILLEGAL drug, MARIJUANA. The bottomline is, it's ILLEGAL. He isn't any normal 23 year old. He's a 14 time gold medal winner, who makes MILLIONS of dollars. He should hold himself up to a higher standard, no pun intended.

The autographs are on New York Penn League baseballs and are on balls which were used during the games.  Most of the autographs before 2002 look fine but after 2002 I am having trouble with the signatures fading.  The ink from the pen is becoming fat and spreading out on the balls and is becoming faint.  I have contacted the manufacturers of the baseballs and have been told that the baseballs have been made from the same ingredients the past 10 years.  I have tried having a brand new, unused ball signed but am still having the same problem with the signature fading.  Does anyone know what is causing the autographs to disappear and how this can be prevented?  Many of the signatures are of players who have made it to the majors and may even be in the Hall of Fame someday.  I keep all of the baseball in a cool, dark place out of the sun light and have tried leaving something in the area to take moisture out of the air but the ink keeps fading.  Thanks for your input.

I am hoping Bynum can return by the second round so that he has enough time to get back into the swing of thing before the finals.

We can make the Finals without him but I think we need him or another big man who can stand and play D in the lane to help Gasol and allow Gasol to play PF. I realize we will most likely face the Cavs this season and Gasol & LO will match up better against Z and Ben than KG and dirty Perkins.

Kobe is on a mission this year and one thing the celts fans like to forget, Gasol was a midseason pick up. Gasol and the team didnt have enough time to blend. KG, Ray and the Celts had all season now the Lakers have had time to get experince together. Farmar has more experince and Gasol and Kobe are playing even better together with the likes of Powell and Ariza. Bynum will be back by the finals but if not we will survive.

This makes the NFL more "clean" in terms with gameplay (bad officiating is limited or restricted).       Why doesn't the NBA have this? I know it would slow down the pace of the game, but at least coaches should get a challenge call.

(marion, j johnson, q rich, bell)   im beginning to think the reason is becasue of steve nash on defense.   on defense he is pretty terrible. on offense he is really great. great shooter and playmaker.    i noticed this alot about nash everytime the suns are winning or the suns have the upper hand he seems to be a passer but when thigns start to become shaky he wants to shoot. theres nothing wrong with that he is a great shooter but its the momentum of the game.    when the suns are playing watch nash during the game and especially the fourth quarter 4 or 5 minutes to go when they are losing or its a close game. during the season the suns are great come playoff time they lose to the spurs more often than not.    remember last season during mid feb. when the trading deadline was coming and they traded jason kidd to the mavericks? i thought they should of traded kidd to the suns for nash because kidd plays defense and the nets need to rebuild. if nash came to the nets they would be a great offensive team. give him the ball let him do what he wants. he wants to shoot alot and pass. he would bring alot of value on the offensive side to the other four guys on the floor with him. then hopefully some of them would get traded. with devin harris he is still developing and its going to take some time for him to be a really great player      and besides jason kidd isnt doign any better right now on the mavericks seems like they dont need him.

Vickie Guerrero new Smackdown GM ( Her and Kristal do have a secret )      2. Batista vs Undertaker vs. Mark Henry fued( All three of them hate each other, so obvious )      3. Vince vs Mysterio fued ( Vince is an ECW Champion now, and him and Rey Rey have a match sheduled at Summerslam, could this be the man Vince will lose the belt to, after all, rey is an ECW original )      4. Big ideas for Kane ( All I have to say is keep your eye on him i nthe coming months )      5. And the current unknown situation is what will go on wit hthe following people - Cena, Edge, HBK, Orton, and Triple H.      These will all most likley happen over the next months. Maybe as some people know, there is a secret group, and we figure out what will happen over the months in the WWE, these are our most recent ideas. Enjoy, Mike...

20070501143441AAqTpUY	Sports;Other - Sports	Skateboarding Questions?	Im starting to skateboard and i have a few questions. I am right handed and if im a righty do i push with my left leg or right leg? Say im on a skateboard and my left leg is on the skateboard and my right leg is pushing off, is that a lefty way and what would you call that? I asked other people and they had different answers. They said the goofy way is facing your right like what i just described but others say its facing the left. On a scooter i have my left foot on the scooter and my right pushing, is that for left handers or right handers? Also with the snowboard i think right handed people face the left? I know it doesnt matter but will i balance better facing the way i am supposed to based on what i use more? like if im a righty. MY friends all face the left and push with their left feet and are all right handed so im guessing that is for right handers. So if anyone knows what is considered the goofy way and the other way and knows if i should change sides while using a skateboard

Now I know there has always been monsters in wrestling you know your 6 foot 4, 300 pounds muscle freaks who can do 4 moves.But at the moment in wwe there seems to be a hell of alot of them . In the early 90's we had useless muscle freaks such as lex luger and uilmate warrior.But they were atleast good entertainers. Now we have wrestlers who can't wrestle or aren't entertaining. The mid 90's was a great time for wrestling we saw wrestlers who had talent main eventing and put on great matches you had bret hart,mr perfect,benoit,lance storm,malenko and many more.But it seems wwe is ingnoring its fans! remember tough enough? well the two smallest guys were the winner and runner up. That in my opinion was the fans saying they want wrestlers not bodybliuders.So hopefully if we are going back in time soon there will be a explosion of alot more talented wrestlers in wwe instead of them hiring non talented mucsle freaks. what do you think?

20090202205246AAKJ0gb	Sports;Baseball	Would Kevin Millar be a nice fit for the Mets?	I'm not sure exactly where he'd fit in, but he'd really be a clubhouse leader. He's won a World Series before. He's really someone who could keep the clubhouse upbeat. That's a role Pedro used to serve, but he's apparently no longer a Met. Millar's a right-handed bat off the bench and has a lot of the same veteran traits as Julio Franco.      At this moment, the Mets bench is Castro, Cora and Tatis. The other two spots are supposed to be a competition of Angel Pagan, Jeremy Reed, Cory Sullivan, Rob Mackowiak, Nick Evans and Marlon Anderson. There's been talk that they've been interested in adding another right-handed bat off the bench, because Tatis is expected to platoon and won't be there a lot. Plus, there's a chance Tatis won't be as productive or healthy next season.      When the Orioles said they weren't interested in bringing him back, he responded by saying it was okay because he knew the Orioles had know shot at winning this year. That was pretty blunt and ballsy, which is the kind of thing the Mets need. They had that with Lo Duca a couple years back. There's the argument to though that there's no room for Millar. Or that he may expect too much money. At this point though, he may be cheap enough.

20090202204418AA6XIeM	Sports;Cricket	Ehich University do you prefer?	I am only in tenth grade, and I am already thinking about college. I would really like to go to Temple University in Philidelphia, Penn State University (main campus), University of Texas @ Austin (main campus), or Brown University (Ivy) to major in either Journalism or Athletic Training.   I was just wondering which colleges you think I could qualify for and what I could do more to better my chances of getting in. I am currently at the top 56% of my class, and I have a 3.2 GPA, so I am very close to meeting those requirements. Now I have two and a half more years of high school, to higher grades and do all of the stuff.     Here are my current overall grades for my classes this year:    Desktop Publishing - 96%  Comp. English 10 - 88%  Journalism I - 95%  Physical Education - 95%  Health 10 - 89%  Family and Consumer Science 10 - 86%  Geometry - 85%  Chorus - 98%  Physical Science - 83%  U.S. History II Honors - 80%    Also, I know colleges like their students to be involved in extraciricular activites, and I am involve in a few.....    -I was an Assistant Counselor at a children's summer camp for two years.  -I'm in my church's youth group.  -I'm a journalist for my high school's newspaper.  -I'm hoping to become sports editor of my school's newspaper, next year (so this one doesn't count yet).  -I'm in the SADD Club at my school.  -I'm a manager for my high school's wrestling team.  -I'm going to be joining my high school's tennis team this year.  -I'm finally going to be a Student Intern Athletic Trainer for my school's baseball team.    Which of the colleges abover do you think I could easily get into?

When I started running, the reason I wasn't able to run that long was because I was always out of breath and my heart would beat too fast.  Now after a few months, the reasons I can't run for long distances is 1. My quads are really sore/hurt and 2. My right foot falls asleep when running.        My roommate, an avid runner, took one look at my feet and said I had flat feet.  I looked at his feet, his feet had arch pretty high, my feet were almost completely flat. Do you think this is due to my flat feet? Is there anyway I can fix this? Insoles, if so what type? Should I go to a podiatrist?      I'm in pretty good shape, I can swim, do more than enough pull ups, push ups, crunches, I just lack in running.  My roommate also said I need to use my arms when running (I always have my arms bent and stationary).      Any help would be appreciated!   Thanks

20090202211038AARd0Tx	Sports;Wrestling	Does it seem as though they are pushing the "STF" more instead of the move formerly known as the FU?	In Cena's match Jerry Lawler said he calls it the attitude adjustment? I have yet to hear the move called anything in the past few weeks at all, I heard about the FU being changed to the throwback, but then I hear this other name. Not that it matters really but is it really going to be known as the attitude adjustment?       Anyway my original question... It seems like the STF has been used more recently and they were really talking up tonight like it was going to be a difference maker in the elimination chamber. Anyone else think so?

20090202212355AAQvYVw	Sports;Basketball	Golden State and the Clippers Can Not Come So Soon?	I can not wait until we get hell week over with. Maybe steal 1/2 off the Cavs and Celtics game and take the Blazers game, so the competition lightens up for the Knicks and they play the Warriors and Clippers.    Maybe Duhon and Lee have another 22 assist game and a 37 point/20 rebound game. Then it will be interesting to see Randolph and the lowly Clipps against NY for the 1st team.
20090202212335AALJheX	Sports;Basketball	Why do people call Celtics fan bandwagoners?	I mean, even during the 2006-2007 season they sold 90.4% of the stadium on average....getting on average about 17,000 fans. Plus, the people there stood and cheered for Ryan Gomes, Delonte West, and especially Paul Pierce. (I went to all 41 home games that season, plus some preseason games)  Plus, we have loyal fans who have been there from the start, the people who have seats in front of me have been season ticket holders since 1958, and my family has had them since 1962. There is tradition in Boston, the most championships, and the most loyal fans. How can anybody accuse us of being bandwagoners when the Celtics are the only team we can possibly love?

20090202213947AAPqYFi	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	+P, grain, FPS, how they factor into manufacturers specifications?	I picked up my first revolver this past weekend, a Taurus 605 2-1/4 SS 357M.  I needed something smaller than my 4506 to carry, when I don't have a hoodie and jacket on in the summer, and the 605 is perfect.  The manual says no 357 cartridges over 158 grain and 1460FPS, which is more important, the grain or the FPS?  The reason I ask, I just bought some extreme shock fang face that's rated at 124 grain but 1496 FPS.  I'm assuming if the grain is lower and the FPS is high, the rounds would be +P?  Probably a question I should have asked before I paid $42 for 20 rounds, but, Id like to have the best defensive ammo possible to carry without hurting my gun and/or myself in the process.  Thoughts?

And yes, I saw the bad calls too, but the game is over and nothing we say on here will change that. I didn't want the Steelers to get to six before the Cowboys did, but sh!t happens. Arizona could have won that football game, but they didn't come through when they needed to. Seriously, guys. Warner put that interception in Harrison's hands like he was the intended receiver. I said it last last night and I'll say it again, congratulations Steelers fans. And kudos to Cards fans. Ya'll played a great game!

20090202213614AA1FR8t	Sports;Olympics	I think that all of Michael Phelps sponsors should drop him and he should be suspended from swimming for 1 ?	year just to prove a point.  He claims, hey, I'm just a dumb 23 year old who put myself in a bad position, by taking a bong hit of pot.  The thing is, I'm not even against pot, I think it should be legalized.  What I'm against is that we are in a major recession, and this jerk, Olympic Swimming great Michael Phelps, who is making MILLIONS in endorsements from Speedo, Wheaties, everything you can think of, is at some party, taking a bong hit of an ILLEGAL drug, MARIJUANA.  The bottomline is, it's ILLEGAL.  He isn't any normal 23 year old.  He's a 14 time gold medal winner, who makes MILLIONS of dollars.  He should hold himself up to a higher standard, no pun intended.  He shouldn't be on the Wheaties box, and then get his photo taken smoking weed.  They should make an example of him.  You agree?
