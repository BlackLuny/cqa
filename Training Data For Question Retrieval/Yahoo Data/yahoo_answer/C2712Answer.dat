LAXxaxAZaa	Mane n Tail is great, and pretty inexpensive. You can get it at Walgreens or any drugstore.|`|GfC98fstaa	I have tried a lot of shampoos and conditioners, from mane & tail to quick n' silver.<br>  <br>  I have found that the best brand that is good for your horse's skin and coat is Cowboy Magic. It leaves a great scent on your horse's coat. You only need to use 2 tablespoons or shampoo and conditioner for your horse. (NO JOKE! That's all your need!) The conditioner leaves your horse smooth and with a healthy, shinny coat. The conditioner last EXTREMELY long on your horse. You can wash your horse's face and it is not harmful to them.<br>  <br>  It is very low in cost and a very good shampoo and conditioner.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend it.|`|pTmrZicfaa	Super Poo (I know, weird name...) works great, I have only been able to find it at tack stores, but it might be selling more places now. <br>  It brightens whites realllly well and brings out other colors just as well.

Dawn dish soap works better.  Quick silver since she is mostly white would be the best thing.  It's purple (bluing shampoo) and really brightens up light color horses.  I use it on my cremello.  U can get quick sliver type shampoo from walmart just look for a dark purple or dark blue shampoo that says it's for grey or blonde hair.  The pet stores like petco also carrys brightening shampoo for dogs it would prolly work fine too.  For the first bath of the year i get a bath mit and really work the shampoo to the skin, where u can just use a bucket with soap suds in it for follow up or after ride baths.  I'll give u an awesome secert i learned.  Take a bucket of 1/4 lasersheen (lasersheen is best for light horses, showsheen and wonder pepi is better for colored horses), 1/4 vinegar or listerine (not both though), to 2/4th's water.  Put it on after u sweat scrape ur rinsed horse, and then scrape it back off.  It's a coat rinse and leaves them super soft, smelling great and helps the dirt roll off after they are dry.  The vinegar or listereen is also a fungicide so it kills any trace of rain rot or gruby's after the winter.  After hard summer rides i sub vetorlin liment for the vinegar.  As for mane and tail i am a huge advocate of cowboy magic detailer, the cremello is a connemera with a draft size tail and it does awesome.  Happy bathing.<br>  <br>  Finally looked at her pic, she is lovely, if u want to make her super pretty put some hoof dressing oil on her hooves (always use clear hoof oil on white hooves and can use clear or the hoof black on black feet), and some baby oil on her muzzle, she'll be picture perfect.  Oh for this summer make sure u get her a fly mask with a nose or put sun screen on her pretty pink nose and eyes (or preferably keep her in the barn or in a turn out sheet during the day.  The light skins will sun burn:(   My poor cream hates sunscreen and won't wear a nose mask so the sun screen is a dayily must, poor girl.  And she's still gotten burn a few times.

They will certainly die within a week, due to lack of filtration. If anything, put them back in the original tank to increase their survival rate. Fish without a filter, especially young fry = dead fish! A bowl offers no filtration or heating, and tropical fish, like guppies, need a heater! <br>  If you can, find a small plastic box, poke holes in the top and sides, place the box in the main tank, and place the guppy fry inside. This will be much better than putting them in a (deathtrap) bowl.<br>  As for feeding, you can feed them<br>  -Finely crushed flakes<br>  -Cooked egg yolk, mixed with water<br>  -Brine shrimp<br>  -Commercial fry food<br>  Please don't keep them in the bowl. Unless you want dead fish, that is. <br>  <br>  It's not normal to stay still at the bottom. Normal fry stay at the top, especially if there is floating plants. The reason that they are staying at the bottom is because they are extremely STRESSED! Put them in a plastic container with a lid, and drop it into the main tank, as mentioned above.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|mWCKTAouaa	Theses flakes that are to big take 1 and crush it between your fingers this will make the pieces really Small for your fish to it.<br>  <br>  the reason why they are sitting on the bottom is that they were just born or they are stressed out from you moving them.<br>  <br>  Did you put in tap water?

HJa7cVFMaa	Hair loss can occur for a number of reasons in hamsters. Fur loss can be due to both disease and non-disease conditions. It is a fairly common problem, especially in older hamsters over 1 year old. Continual rubbing on feeders or sides of the cage could be one cause. But the most common reasons are age, protein deficiency, and vitamin deficiency.  It is generally first seen starting around the face, neck and chest, then around the tummy area and hind legs. A high diet of seed, can lead to obesity and potential nutritional deficiencies. Vitamin deficiencies can easily be rectified by providing a high quality, and good balanced diet. Supplementing the diet with water soluble vitamins found at any pet store. I don't normally agree with these products but there could be something he is lacking, it would certainly do no harm giving them to him. Other supplements to the diet may include breakfast cereals (no sugared ones) whole wheat pasta, cheese, boiled eggs, yoghurt, fresh fruits and vegetables.<br>  It is the deficiency of the B vitamins, especially B6, biotin, inositol and folic acid, in the diet that may lead to fur loss, and tiredness amongst a host of other things. Most of the above contain these vitamins.<br>  <br>  Deficiency in most B vitamins can lead to tiredness, weakness, and hair loss<br>  Vitamin B-1: leads to, weakness, fatigue.<br>  Vitamin B-12: Tiredness, general weakness.<br>  B-6: hair loss, and muscular weakness. <br>  B-3:  (nicotinic acid) tiredness.<br>  Inositol: Is also a member of the B group: Vital for hair growth. In laboratory trails, animals that lacked Inositol in the diet produced baldness, but when the vitamin was again added to the food of these animals, the hair grew back.<br>  Inositol: May be found in bananas, brown rice, oak flakes, vegetables, wheat germ, nuts, If the inositol intake is not sufficient, symptoms such as hair loss, and skin problems can arise.<br>  <br>  Hamster Breeder|`|tdJ1wE7daa	He is getting pretty old for a hamster.

IfCoalbvaa	Maiden: A class for horses that haven't won over 3 blue ribbons (It might be different where you are but that's how it is here.)<br>  Pleasure: A class judged on how the horse moves, handles, and all around how pleasing it looks to ride. <br>  Open: Riders and horses of all ages and past show records can enter in this class.<br>  17 and under: Only riders under 17 can enter this class.<br>  Equitation: Judged equally on the horse and rider performance.<br>  <br>  <br>  Normally in those classes the judge will ask you to walk, trot, reverse, walk, then trot again then them will ask you to line up facing the judge and one by one back up. It is the same for every class. The only class you will be asked to do different things in is "judges command" where you will be asked to do whatever the judge wants.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	A maiden class is for a horse who has never won a blue ribbon while showing. <br>  <br>  A pleasure class is a class that is judged entirely on the horse's way of going, not the rider's equitation. The judge is usually looking for a horse with a nice forward walk/trot who looks like he/she is a pleasure to ride. <br>  <br>  A equitation class is judged a little bit on the horse but mostly on the rider's position. Heels down, correct diagonals, sitting up straight, etc. <br>  <br>  Any class that says 17 and under is just that: it is open only to riders who are 17 and under. <br>  <br>  Any class that says open is open to any rider of any age. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|hC3efmxUaa	Walk Trot only classes will specify that a class is for (Walk/Trot only).  Other shows can list classes as GYAP which means that you can Go at Your Own Pace.  This mean you must perform at the walk and one other gait of your choice when asked to.  You must also repeat those same gaits in both directions.  eg...if you walk and lope going to the right then you must walk and lope going to the left.  <br>  As for the different types of classes your best way to find out what they are looking for is look on the individual show's websites, or breed's websites.  If it is a quarter horse show, go to www.AQHA.com, etc.  Different parts of the country (USA) have different things that the judges look for.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
8bTder08aa	Poco Bueno was one of the "founding fathers" of the Quarter Horse breed.  He was a Waggoner-bred stallion;  the Waggoners and Klebergs were among the most prominent breeders of the type of horse that became the American Quarter-running Horse breed.<br>  <br>  This is one website devoted to Poco Bueno:  <a href="http://www.waggonerranch.com/pokieinfo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.waggonerranch.com/pokieinfo.h...</a><br>  <br>  At one time Poco Bueno was the leading sire of AQHA champions;  he still ranks 3rd;  quite a feat in these days of large books of mares and artificial insemination.  At the time Poco Bueno was standing at stud, a "full book" was considered to be 40-50 mares;  nowadays, it isn't unusual for a stallion to sire more than 150 offspring in a season.  <br>  <br>  In addition to halter champions, Poco Bueno was the sire of many performance champions;  he's found in the pedigrees of many successful cutting horses and reining champions.  Obviously he was a great athlete with a great mind, who passed these traits along to many of his offspring.  <br>  <br>  Because Poco Bueno was born in 1944 and died in 1969, most horses that have him in the pedigree have him three or more generations back.  <br>  <br>  If there is a stallion who could be considered one of the "foundation sires" of the Quarter Horse breed, it would be Poco Bueno.  He was and is still in many ways the ideal that Quarter Horse breeders strive for and rarely even come close to.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/poco+bueno" rel="nofollow">http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/poco+bue...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aqha.com/foundation/halloffame/images/Poco%20Bueno.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aqha.com/foundation/halloffam...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ispyhorses.com/reference_horse/Quarter_Horses/Poco_Bueno.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ispyhorses.com/reference_hors...</a><br>  <br>  (FWIW, reading about the foundation of the Quarter Horse breed is fascinating, IMO, and I think anyone who loves and honors horses, especially Quarter Horses, could do a lot worse than spending some time reading about the early days of the Quarter Horse breed and how it came to be.

Zantanon was found in Mexico living on corn husks. He was brought to the United States and became one of the great sires of the Quarter Horse breed. Poco Bueno became a great sire of cutting horses.

And some animals, brought to clinics by Good Samaritans, don't have an owner to pay for treatment.

5TM9P8tsaa	*It is fine. Even humans can ingest cat nip. If humans make a tea out of it, it relaxes us. Same with most animals except the cat. It is like booze to them.|`|7f40a0efee482e94e2baa04fac426e33aa	My ferret abby plays with cat toys with cat nip.I dont think it will hurt her she has been playing with them for months now.I usually buy cat toys for my ferret.|`|R1vgkPpHaa	Ferrets are okay to be around catnip. I wouldn't expect it to affect your ferret like it would some cats, but it should be just fine for your ferret to be around.|`|PR42HDjraa	it probably won't hurt  him. But call ur vet and ask just be be sure. better safe than sorry
K0tpQoHRaa	THE RIGHT THING TO DO!!!!!<br>  just simply cover the cage with a sheet it is understood to them to be quiet or assure them that it is time for bed.turning off near lights may help the problem.like the feeling of night and day for humans .it works wonders for me!!!!|`|BlA60kDVaa	Beautiful!  Spring is nigh!<br>  <br>  Wouldn't life be awful without such choruses of communication of life!<br>  <br>  By the way, I am a seagull and I find the noise of people and cars really annoying!|`|D75rqaihaa	i had love birds that wouldnt shut up like the sounds of your case...but mine were in a cage and all i could do was put a blanket over there cage...but if your talking about wild birds, well, theres not much you can do to be honest...just get to leep before they start|`|1NPVVxW0aa	Street lights. They make birds chirp all night long. If you ever cycle through into a street lighted town at night you'll notice it immediately!!<br>  <br>  We are at the time of year when birds migrate back to the UK or start their mating calls etc...|`|2COaydcfaa	i noticed that a few years ago. The birds are affected by the changing climate. Just like the rest of us|`|ak0T96CQaa	I recommend any gauge shotgun. They are just birds, it won't take much.|`|6LPxzVsPaa	I noticed that with my old bird, Blue-Nose. (it had a blue nose.)<br>  <br>  We had put it down. It was so annoying.|`|GSFH3Hvgaa	Well you can always try making a really big sound that will scare them away. Or even something physical that will scare them. Make sure though that you don't have any bird feeders around. I wouldn't go with a gun because it would scare the neighbors into thinking that someone was killed since its so early in the morning|`|bqj9aqhWaa	if your birds are in the same cage they may start getting Territorial so if you can separate they're cages and put them on different levels or places of the house it might stop and i think u should put a towel over it too!|`|zpMXhynkaa	I'm going to assume you are writing about the wild birds outside since you don't mention anything about a cage and how close it is to your bedroom.  <br>  <br>  Spring is swiftly closing in (thank goodness) and perhaps they sense this. That is only one reason of many that are possible.   I suggest some type of noise buffer for now.  Perhaps a fan or sound machine that might act as white noise to mask over the sounds of the birds.  Not much more you can do.  <br>  <br>  You can't change the birds patterns but you can certainly change the way you react to them. Good luck
BWez86Ldaa	People, as a whole, are extremely ignorant are readily believe anything. As a race, humans don't like change, so we tend to keep believing things even though they have been proven wrong (anything about rodents/pet rodents, that one planet isn't really a planet! lol). <br>  <br>  Rodents haven't been popular pets for long. Especially rats have blown up in popularity over the past year or two! Ferrets use to be, by far, more popular pets than rats just a few years ago. Think about this: Rats in the wild ate many crops in farm lands, gave people many diseases, and were *overall* bad for the human population. This is still true in certain parts of the world (New York, for example), where rats are literally pests among the people. <br>  <br>  What makes dogs and cats different is that they have been pets so far back as ancient Egypt! Dogs and cats are more readily sociable and more prone to enjoy and give affection, and less prone to disease because they have better immune systems.<br>  <br>  You're right, PET rats are loving, sweet, cuddle butts full of wonder and fun, but the wild rat has caused many problems among humans over many, many years. Don't get me wrong; I, personally, have 14 domesticated pet rats, and they are simply a joy, I love them each to death! :) <br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question thoroughly! :P|`|f6c72MTmaa	Yes so true!<br>  My mum is so scared of mice, rats, guinea-pigs and hamsters. I find them affectionate little angels! <br>  When my dog found a mouse and chewed it up i was very upset. I was at my friends house and her cat caught a baby mouse. It was soo tiny!<br>  It was wild but i had lots of love to give it. I was planning on sneaking it to my house but then i let my friend keep it. It turned out to be ugly but with a nice nature. Pretty mixed up heh? <br>  well  we named it gordan and then gordon got killed by there dog. Gordon was awsome!|`|1378862e7f14f3d6b3ca9f2e14f3ba94aa	I AGREE, WENEVER I TELL MY FRIENDS I HAVE RATS THEY ALWAYS SAY IM DISGUSTING OR MAKE A DISGUSTED FACE. I GET SO PISSED OFF, IMEAN HOW WOULD THEY KNOW HOW ITS LIKE TO HAVE A RAT IF THEY NEVER HAD ONE IN THERE LIFE.<br>  <br>  UR RIGHT GURLFRIEND. SPEAK THE TRUTH, LOUD AND CLEAR.<br>  <br>  PINKLOVER|`|OrvTG44laa	It's because people think of dirty, rabid rats in the sewer.  Pet rats are cool and fun.|`|TsKYW21daa	Lots of people these days have a fixed idea that rats and mice are "those hairy filthy things."  I get what you are saying :S  Rats are actually very intelligent.  People underestimate them, don't you think?|`|V2TJAwHZaa	Yeah I love rodents I don't know why some people( mainly women) think they really icky.|`|xB2wRYYBaa	you got that right, i get really annoyed too. just keep spreading the WORD!!:D|`|379EMSojaa	i know what you mean they are really cute and they show affection.|`|7tfpfXHgaa	RIGHT ON GIRL!|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Yeah,rats!!! I love them! I've had 7 males and currently own 4 of these wonderful sweethearts!!!!

Never...Rat owners are always willing to proudly talk about them! <br>  <br>  These guys are my pride and joy:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://petratsindiana.ning.com/profile/RatMomma68" rel="nofollow">http://petratsindiana.ning.com/profile/R...</a>|`|8to6MsWuaa	Yeah, i agree. I love all rodents. Rats make wonderful pets, even better than a rabbit. They are smart, and affectionate.
F3FrZ7eAaa	live plants rarely survive long in a turtle tank, before they are eaten. Therefore, to maintain a green tank it is advisable to use artificial plants that are easily available with your pet store. After initially attempting to eat them the turtles would eventually let them be. While buying artificial plants ensure that they are not very delicate or have sharp edges.|`|kSIxfA1Raa	Of course you can. Its a very good replacement to live plants, i say go for it.|`|09fdLaeIaa	plastic or real plants<br>  a turtle will tear it apart<br>  a have two by the way<br>  they kill plants|`|GQ3v0mRhaa	yea i think you can|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Why bother? They just make the tank harder to keep clean.
Rzho75Ssaa	Yes, do it. Think of the fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|9YCmiewRaa	It is possible, and there are commercial vegetarian dog foods on the market. Don't try home cooked, though, the diet needs to be very carefully balanced. And vegetarianism is not an option for cats, by the way, they tend to die.<br>  <br>  Is it right? It has no health benefits for your dog, it's not what he would choose for himself, and I doubt he has moral issues with eating dead animals!  It's up to you. Of my vegetarian friends who have dogs, some keep their dogs on veggie diets, and some cook meat especially for their dogs.|`|wgtjMcjEaa	Dogs are omnivores meaning they need meat and vegetables. It would be hard to find a protein substance for the meat that is in processed dog food that would also give them all the nutrients that they need. I don't think it's recommended by veterinarians to make a dog vegetarian, although if you do enough research, you may be able to find a suitable diet for them.|`|CvbB4qv3aa	Unless its because the dog prefers veg, then do it.<br>  If its because you don't eat meat and are trying to force that up on your dog then don't.<br>  <br>  Dogs love meat, its a big part of their diet.<br>  What happens if you get the diet wrong?, and miss out key nutrients?<br>  You will have one sick dog.<br>  <br>  Dogs are hunters by nature leave it that way.|`|lNzhglLFaa	you can do it... they make foods that are vegetarian diets for dogs... but i really don't know if it is the best thing for your dog.. if her (or she) were wild.. what would they normally eat? meat.. not veggies from the garden.. meat.. i would talk it over with your vet before doing anything...|`|xfBbEgQWaa	There are LOTS of dogs that need to be on a vegetarian diet for allergy's. There are a few really good quality veggie dog foods. Dogs are carnivores, but the can eat a proper balanced vegetarian food.|`|ZoeS825Kaa	It's a dog, it would naturally go through the hassle of killing for food, rather than simply eating vegetation, I'm sure there is a reason for this. Give the animal some meat.|`|EFA4Azb1aa	Dogs are omnivorous.  They will eat any thing.  I do know of some one who was a vegan whose border collie was a vegetarian.  There are some excellent vegetarian dog foods on the market.|`|fEcV1CB7aa	dogs are carnivores hunters it wrong to stop them eating meat if you don't want to eat it then it's your choice but it's cruel to force it on the dog|`|C4Z7IEffaa	Poor dog that you would even consider forcing your unnatural beliefs on it.|`|D75rqaihaa	dogs are NOT ment to be vegitarian....<br>  so no its not  right<br>  i know some one that did this<br>  and the dog just went phsyco<br>  it was horrible......dont do it!!!|`|7vJNHaskaa	No...dogs need proteins and such from meat that they can't get in vegetables. Your dog is a *carnivore*|`|j6LTzlUfaa	No, is it fook. Dogs are supposed to eat meat, just like humans, you twat|`|L6LdyWn5aa	No, dogs need meat to be healthy.|`|AOOKr1K6aa	Dogs are carnivores. You know what that means, right?|`|mMmNEljxaa	Does he want my tofu? I hate it|`|UW9Trvrpaa	Dogs are naturally carnivorous. They need the nutrients that come from meat. If you really are against your dog eating meat. Giving it vegetables is okay. But, you do have to give it dry dog food that can replace the nutrients found in meat. Also, if your dog is really against eating vegetables, do not force it. It might refuse to eat and starve. Give the dog a choice. If it is okay with eating vegetables, Make sure your providing enough nutrients that come from meat.|`|9syEUfnqaa	its possible, but not recommended. they need meat, and limiting them to vegetables wouldn't complete their food needs and would not make them healthier..remember they arent humans. they're dogs and are totally different. For example, if you give them caffeine, they'll go right to sleep.humans do opposite.|`|WYuK1OUnaa	I have heard same question about children in the past!<br>  A good friend used to send her vegetarian son to mine so he could have odd treat of a burger etc!!! [she suffered guilt about not giving the lad a choice]<br>  I guess its a personal choice but if your lovely dog decides to chew on your leg out of desperation maybe you should re think your strategy!|`|3R4WcWLWaa	No... I don't think that its fair on the dog. I don't think that it would be healthy either, dogs are carnivorous after all.<br>  I do however give my dogs some vegetables with their meals but the often eat around them.|`|Ri45rVahaa	I think all dogs need some meat, you could buy dry dog food that contains meat but you wouldn't know by looking at it.|`|EAdZnaI6aa	No, dogs are carnivorous, meat is essential to their diet.|`|PM23RDycaa	No its not. Your dog is a carnivore. Just because YOU choose to eat meat doesn't mean your dog should have to be forced to change its diet. Unless your dog is actually allergic to the majority of meat based proteins there is NO reason other than to make YOU comfortable to put them on a vegetarian based kibble.<br>  <br>  Seriously I know vegetarians who have their dogs on the raw meat diet. If thy can put their personal comfort aside YOU can feed a meat based kibble.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	you can<br>  but remember, dogs are mostly carnivorous<br>  they need those nutrients<br>  my dog actually acts omnivorous but he definetely likes meat the best|`|edzU8VJiaa	Presumably, you mean vegetarian?  NO.  You may be vegetarian, but your dog certainly isn't.  You could make him ill, especially if he is only 6 months old.<br>  <br>  Eat whatever you want, according to your personal beliefs, but you have to accept that your dog is a carnivore, and you should not project your beliefs on  to him.  He is designed to eat meat (that's what his big teeth are for), and if you make him a vegetarian because of your beliefs, then you have to accept that he will probably not live very long because essential elements are missing from his diet.<br>  <br>  English Springers, though, are pretty well omnivorous.  They will eat absolutely anything, and adore fish.  Do you eat fish? This could replace the meat element in his diet, as long as you make sure he is given enough other elements in his diet to replace the iron and other trace elements he would get from meat. <br>  <br>  You need to talk to your vet. and be guided by him/her as regards your dog's diet.|`|ne22im5Haa	Only when accompanied by a program of Yogic flying and Zen meditation. Instead of training my dog to fetch a stick I give it a bowl of marbles and some joss sticks and let it Feng Shui my garden.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	No, dogs are carnivores, they need PROTEIN in their diets. Don't force your new age lifestyle on your dog. Even if you don't like eating animals, he does.|`|OQsj0Am3aa	It'll also make your dog really smelly.<br>  <br>  Dog farts are bad enough but this'll make them worse !|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Sure, if you know what you're doing. <br>  Most vegetarian and vegan food on the market is all grains though.<br>  BTW people, there is plenty of protein in vegetables, look at broccoli it has basically the same amino acid complex of steak.<br>  People who are against it have never met a vegetarian dog, they are often some of the healthiest it's just difficult.<br>  You often get the same reactions people give you when you say you're vegetarian or vegan.|`|386fa1284d4c180bfe964db1309fabd1aa	Dogs are NOT obligate carnivores, they are omnivores with a diet rich in proteins. There are no amino acids needed by dogs that cannot be supplied by a vegetarian diet. This is not true for cats btw. It is difficult to formulate a complete vegetarian diet for dogs but it is certainly not impossible to do so. However, there is no real reason to resort to a vegetarian diet - the feeding of a complete dry food is by far the best solution. Many of the complete foods smell 'yeasty' rather than 'meaty', and so are very inoffensive. A food like Chappie is mostly based on fish proteins and does not look or smell 'meaty'.|`|TK93mS1Qaa	dogs are NOT CARNIVORES!!!...geez sum of these people r dumb!...u can make him a vegitarian just give him sum protein in his diet...like eggs or sumthing...unless u want him 2 be vegan...lol...DOGS ARE OMNIVORES!!!...its cats that are carnivores and cats can not be vegitarian...!!!!|`|b8tgCAQJaa	No. Dogs aren't as adaptable as humans and they need meat to stay healthy.<br>  <br>  Give your dog the food that's best for him, not just what suits you.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	No. Dogs eat some vegetation but they are primarily carnivores and need meat to be healthy.|`|MWrwnHM2aa	No, dogs are carnivores, they need protein and they survive off meat.<br>  They need a supply of meat <br>  Good luck|`|BlA60kDVaa	Dogs eat anything.<br>  <br>  Coprohagia is the technical term for eating feces.|`|lNfv18Bsaa	no, they are natural carnivores
b9Hqdf2Haa	nope they're herbivores|`|MxculX2Daa	Don't know about that - but they do like eating garden worms occasionally. Give you hamster a worm and you will see him/her grab it with their front paws and bite the saddle to kill it then munch it all down.<br>  <br>  FOr real - I used to give my hamster a couple of worms a month. They do eat them if living wild.|`|GcoLseVqaa	no, they cannot!  they can only eat grains and stuff.|`|6LPxzVsPaa	Eww! Gross.<br>  I wouldn't say.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hamsters like vegetables and fruit.<br>  In otherwords, they are herbivores.|`|RNqHL8y7aa	I don't think they can, they only eat fruits and grains and my hamster (May he rest in Peace) used to like cereal! :]<br>  <br>  I don't think hamsters eat snails or slugs.|`|zzB90sQxaa	Um...what? O_O<br>  <br>  I'm guessing no. I don't think hamsters like meat.|`|GHobDAH3aa	Don't feed your hamster slugs or snails!!!

Find a more constructive way to make $5's!!!!|`|41d2426029d24714f91e44951e99d145aa	Maybe you can make a salad and sprinkle some slug bits on it.|`|ztEYy0Igaa	ewwwww who would ever eat snails any ways|`|hxi90NTIaa	No they cannot, so there you go, $5 dollars in your pocket lol|`|O71AvzaYaa	I Really don't think so.|`|ed05ZIrsaa	Don't think so... so you win, lol.|`|EZxdAqEuaa	yea

Put her in a birthing box or laundry basket with some towels in a quiet dark area where she can have peace.  The kittens will start coming about 20 minutes to 1 hour apart.  Let the mother do her stuff, if she doesn't, then with a dry cloth clear the kittens face.|`|srjPOxW7aa	Most likely, Give your cat a place to have her babies in comfort. Cats usually like to have dark quite places with no body around (except her human mama) bundle up some blankets or towels ( that you don't mind blood getting on) for her and let her be on her own in a corner of a closet or bathroom (keep door cracked open). Keep food and water nearby bedding area and just let her be.. check in on her every so often see how she is.|`|6LPxzVsPaa	Yes. All female animals have blood coming out during birth. Clean up the blood with the rag, and throw it out or wash it good.<br>  <br>  Put the mother cat in a corner, not too bright. Get some towels that you do not mind getting blood on.<br>  <br>  If the mother cat does not clean off the newborn kitten's faces, you must do it so they can breath.<br>  <br>  In case if a kitten dies straight after birth, bring the dead cat into a vet, and they will bury it. [It's spirit will live on forever. Lol.]<br>  <br>  She will nurse the babies, do not worry. Those babies will be okay and warm.<br>  <br>  My suggestion will be to keep the kittens for 3 weeks or a month, and sell them after so your house is not too crowded.<br>  <br>  Good luck with those kittens.<br>  -Erika. ?|`|FgHq93suaa	take her to the vet or try calling your vet hospital and tell them (EVEN IF YOU CAN) that you can't afford to take the cat in. dont give them a phone number or your address... they might start solicating at you.

C1eHfhrHaa	no way to tell with mixes.  anywhere between 70 and 130, I would say.|`|fgxajTiBaa	No way to know. Number one there are multiple types of Mastiffs, and two with a mixed breed (especially three breeds) it can be any shape or size between these different breeds. Could be between 60-150 lbs. Give or take.|`|bO9vJY2Caa	depends on the dominant trait
RA3p25Qoaa	they do need a heater 22c is really too cold for them they should be kept between 25c-28c. 21c-22c will make them sluggish and less active. <br>  Under tank heaters also boost humidity which is super important. We all love to breath don't we? if your humidity drops below 70% the hermit crabs can no longer breath. Who wants to be trapped in a cold airless box after all?<br>  <br>  Invest in proper hermit crab supplies. Sadly most " hermit crab" products in stores are useless or dangerous, so do your homework. Expect to pay $150 or so on start up costs but after that it isn't so bad.  If you take the time to set up a proper home and give them proper supplies you won't be replacing hermit crabs on a monthly basis. <br>  <br>  If you don't want / can't spend the money on providing a proper set up don't buy the animal. Plain and simple.|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	Consistant cool temperatures will kill your crabs. Try and keep them in the warmest part of your home too, avoid basements, and they will be fine. Temperatures in your house will very likely drop at night too, so keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Nicole said 4 years in uncommon for a hermit crab lifespan. Hermit crabs have a relatively long life span though, in captivity they have lived upwards of 30 years. On average, I'm sure it is a lot less than that, but if you give them proper care, they should be kickin' for awhile!|`|bexpzOGfaa	Ive bought my hermit crabs from a fair which they came in plastic cages. As long as you keep them in a warmer place in your house they'll be fine.

dDGGgD8caa	Adopting a rat is one of the best things you could do, for one they are super sweet, they dont bite, and they dont stink as long as you get CareFresh bedding. I have 2 rats right now a male and a female, honostly though if you want something fun get a fairly young female, mine is a blast to watch and they are far less territorial than the male, and later if you decide to get a male, be sure to introduce the two on nutral ground not in one or the others cages becouse the WILL fight, I hope you find what you are looking for, also a farret cage or one that you build yourself is needed, one tat is 3ft T X 3ft L X 36 in W is needed for 2 if you get one a 20 gallon fish tank or a rabbit cage will do, and for the aquarium they make top extensions for it so you could make a 2 story. They are very smart they will come when call you can litter train them and they do ttricks, THEY LOVE ANYTHING YOU GIVE THEM so honostly dont give them choclate or at least not to much. Hope this helps, oh and you can get a rat for 5.00 at the most from a pet store, (DONT GET A RAT FROM PETSMART OR PETCO ALL OF THERE RATS HAVE MIGHTS TRUST ME I KNOW.
TgNQAYyXaa	$100 a month sounds like a rip off.  I purchased 6 months supply of Heartguard for $100 Australian recently and I thought that was expensive.<br>  <br>  Have you considered the once a year shot for the dogs?  It costs about $80 (quoting Australian price) annually for the heatworm treatment.

These doses are not comparable to the miniscule doses in licensed heartworm preventive products and using them represents an element of gambling.

F3FrZ7eAaa	Are you sure you're really ready to go and get a snake tomorrow? You don't sound ready. Don't use heat rocks ever too... you should set up his tank before you get him. And if you have to ask all these questions, I really doubt you did your research.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I have nothing better to be doing, so I guess I can help!<br>  <br>  Heating- You need a heat lamp, a bulb (high wattage since your tank is huge), and a large heating pad. You will need two thermometers and a hydrometer. Some people just get one thermometer, but with such a big tank you want to take sure temperatures are properly maintanined. It should be about 80-85 on the cold side, and about 90 on the warm side. The humidity should be at 40-50 and 60 when shedding-- your hydrometer will measure this.<br>  <br>  Substrate- You can use a variety of things. I use aspen, it looks nice, not very expensive and it's comfortable for him. You might want something that holds more humidity since your tank is so big though. NEVER use pine or cedar, make note of that. They are both toxic.<br>  <br>  Tank- If you're getting a baby, I suggest you do not home him in a 55 gallon tank. It's too big, and he will get stressed. A stressed snake won't eat and will become ill. They should start out in a 10-15 gallon tank. If you're worried about extra expense, use a rubber maid or sterlite tub. It will also be easier to clean and get him out this way. Get a lockable lid! This is very important. Your snake WILL escape if it is possible. <br>  <br>  Water dish and hides- two hides are needed. One on the warm side, one on the cold. His water dish should be a fair size. It will also help with humidity. Wooden hides will help with shedding when that time comes around.<br>  <br>  And lastly, food. Your food should be as thick as your snakes girth, or the thickest part of it. You can simply as the breeder or petstore what he is currently being fed to help. Also ask when he was last fed, and if it was live or frozen/thawed. It isn't too easy switching them over.<br>  <br>  Short list-<br>  bedding- aspen (or whatever you choose)<br>  2 thermomters, 1 hydrometer (or thermometer w/ probe)<br>  Large heating pad <br>  Lighting fixture and bulb<br>  2 hides (you can use a cleaned out margerine container with a cut dome to save money, not as 'pretty' though)<br>  1 water dish (you can use a plastic tupperware container)<br>  any other decorations i.e. plants, sticks, extra hides.<br>  food (won't need it for tomorrow though)<br>  <br>  Whew, enough typing now. One last thing though, you should try to avoid holding your snake for a week or so. Your tank is really big, and he will be overwhelmed enough as it is. Good luck with the new baby!|`|6d461f9d3d9b1e07b249bea91e8bfb01aa	buy live mice to feed your python|`|2Z7u3Fksaa	i have a ball python and besides te tank what i have for him is....<br>  A heat lamp<br>  a nocturnal lamp<br>  a hide spot<br>  a coil tree<br>  a water bowl big enough for him to fit in<br>  and for the bedding i used aspen wood chips<br>  Do not get a heat rock or heating pad for under the tank<br>  these products cook and burn your pet<br>  for humidity i have a spray bottle filled with nontap water and i spray the cage down every couple hours and cover the screen top with a towel<br>  the humidity should be between 60 and 70%<br>  and you can get a humidity and temp gauge at petco for cheap<br>  also, never feed your ball python in their habitat<br>  when feeding them the frozen mice get a critter cage for 5 bucks and put him in there when feeding him<br>  hope this helped|`|sSJ8zfebaa	you dont need a heat lamp-but you do need an undertank heater.first thing you need is a good book on ball pythons,or you should consider a corn snake instead.they are much easier with feeding and shedding then you would need a good book on corn snakes.have 6 balls and 4 corns|`|OrvTG44laa	Heat rocks are bad because they burn snakes.

Well now since that is clear lol.  I use the red heat lamps they do not give out a noticeable light to the snake and keeps a nice temperature for them.  Also I am sure you already know this but a ball python is going to need a humidity of 40-60% to provide this you can buy a un-used spray bottle and fill it with water and spray the tank to keep the humidity up.

01nMRPHVaa	Variety is key. Mix it up. Look onto other appropriate sized worms also. I find mealworms easyer to breed then superworms though. <br>  <br>  Superworms require you to isolate them into there own cell to pupate. Just more work. <br>  <br>  Mealworms do not require this. They just pupate in there own container.<br>  <br>  Mealworm Breeding Guide:<br>  Breeding Mealworms is extremely simple to do and can save you time and money. It is also an often discussed topic on various reptile forums and keepers are consistently trying to find the best ways to rear these insects at home. This guide, if followed, will help you start a successful mealworm culture.<br>  <br>  Mealworms, also known as Tenebrio molitor, aren't worms at all. They are actually the larval stage of the Darkling Beetle. The darkling beetle and its larvae are often found harboring in flour, cornmeal, and other grain products. They are considered a pest by agricultural farms that deal in these industries.<br>  <br>  Mealworms make excellent feeders for reptiles. (As well as birds, small mammals, sugar gliders, and fish.) They are very easy to breed in captive environments. I have been breeding them now for almost 8 years.<br>  <br>  The darkling beetle has 4 stages of life that they will go through. Those are the egg, larvae, pupae, and beetle. It's during the larval stage that we feed these insects, and this is the stage that we aim to produce.<br>  <br>  How It Works - Breeding Mealworms <br>  <br>  The mealworms you start with will eat the substrate that you will provide as described below. As they eat and grow, they will shed their exoskeleton and increase in size. The shed exoskeleton will be visible and often sits on the top of the substrate. When the larval stage is complete, the larvae will become dormant and will often be found semi-curled in the corner of the container, on the surface.<br>  <br>  During this dormancy, they will stop eating and begin the metamorphism into the pupae. This is when they are transforming into the darkling beetle. Once the pupae has matured, and the beetle has emerged, you will be presented with the only stage of this critters life that can reproduce. These beetles can often be seen breeding in plain site. Once copulation has transpired, the female will lay eggs in the substrate or on "cage furniture" that you may have provided. The female will lay hundreds of eggs at a time, but they are extremely difficult to see as they normally become consumed within the substrate.<br>  <br>  <br>  Darkling Beetle Life Cycle<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  1. Egg<br>  2. Larvae<br>  3. Pupa<br>  4. Beetle<br>  <br>  Materials Required - Breeding Mealworms<br>  <br>  Breeding Containers<br>  <br>  Just about any smooth sided container will work. I currently have a colony going using 4 ten gallon aquariums. In the past I have used sterilite and rubbermaid containers with great success.<br>  <br>  So long as the container can provide a decent amount of ventilation (to prevent molding), has smooth sides so the mealworms and beetles can't climb out, and you have a modified cover (ventilation), it can potentially work.<br>  <br>  You want to have at least 2-3 containers prepared. This will allow you to keep the mealworms, pupa, and beetles separate. Doing this will help you yield the most mealworms from your colony. <br>  <br>  I am currently using a 4 container system and intend on adding a 5th container. If you have a large collection of reptiles to feed, you too may want to consider additional containers.<br>  <br>  Breeding Containers Screen Mesh<br>  <br>  Most containers are going to require some screen mesh to allow for proper ventilation while still containing the mealworms and beetles. I myself have altered the covers of my aquariums to use a customized screen cover I have built. If you would like instructions for this, have a look here: Custom Screen Tops<br>  <br>  Substrate<br>  <br>  I use a mixture consisting of powdered milk, multi grain (dry) baby food , oatmeal, and cornmeal. I don't just toss them in. Instead, I prefer to blend it all into a fine powder with a blender. This is not a required step, but retrieving the mealworms is much easier when I do this.<br>  <br>  The items I use for my substrate are not what you need to use. Instead, any variety of bran flakes, cornmeal, cheerios, etc. can be used. You want to make sure that the mealworms have a substrate that contains grains as this is a normal diet for them, and it also provides a valuable amount of nutrition. <br>  <br>  If you live near a feed store, any whole grain mixture they sell would be excellent, and preferred over the diet I currently use.<br>  <br>  Heating Device<br>  <br>  This is actually an optional piece of the puzzle. If you are seeking maximum output from your colony, and do not have a room in your home that is a fairly consistent 75-77 degrees, you will want to use a heating device.<br>  <br>  I use an undertank heater to maintain my colonies. I measure the temperature of the substrate, opposed to the air, and have found that temperatures between 75 and 77 degrees do extremely well.<br>  <br>  Mealworms<br>  <br>  Mealworms are required to get the colony going. To begin a successful colony, I suggest starting with no less than 150 mealworms. This will provide you with a large number of beetles to be bred. I prefer to start new colonies with 500 mealworms.<br>  <br>  Breeding Container Preparation - Breeding Mealworms<br>  <br>  The first thing I do is clean the container thoroughly. I do this to ensure that my colony is going to start out in the most sanitized of conditions. I then proceed to mix the substrate and spread it on the bottom of the container. I like to have a layer that is at least 3 inches thick.<br>  <br>  Watering - Breeding Mealworms<br>  <br>  I offer my mealworms moisture by way of carrots and potatoes. I prefer carrots over the potatoes as they don't mold. Instead, they get rubbery until they dry out. Potatoes slices do work extremely well as a means to transfer moisture. <br>  <br>  Heating - Breeding Mealworms<br>  <br>  My mealworms are kept at a consistent 75-77 degrees, though they can be maintained at room temperature, which I have done in the past. Heating the mealworm colony will yield more mealworms, at a faster rate than those kept at the average 70 degrees.<br>  <br>  Feeding - Breeding Mealworms<br>  <br>  The substrate you have chosen is also the diet you are feeding to your mealworms. For this very reason, you should aim to use the highest quality bedding that you can. What you put into your mealworms for nutrition is what you will ultimately be putting into your reptiles as well.<br>  <br>  Gut Loading - Breeding Mealworms<br>  <br>  Gut loading is the process by which your insects are fed nutritious foods before being offered to your reptile. Gut loading is usually done with high nutrient foods for a period of 24-48 hours prior to being offered to your pet. This ensures that your reptile is being given the most nutritious mealworms you can offer.<br>  <br>  General Maintenance - Breeding Mealworms<br>  <br>  You want to check your containers daily. If your mealworms have no moisture source, add one. If you see dead mealworms or beetles, remove them. Transfer any beetles you come across to the breeding container. Ensure that you have an adequate amount of food in with the mealworms. If you find that the food level is scarce, you should use that opportunity to empty the container completely, disinfect it, re-add fresh substrate, and then re-add the mealworms.<br>  <br>  If you are vigilant and maintain your colony, it will continuously produce mealworms for you. <br>  <br>  Final Notes - Breeding Mealworms<br>  <br>  The entire process of a mealworm going from egg to beetle takes between 10-12 weeks. Those that do not use supplemental heating may experience longer time frames however.<br>  <br>  When you start your colony, expect it to take 4-6 weeks before any visible babies are present. Just be consistent and before you know it, the petstore will become a thing of the past. Use the money you have saved to get another reptile!|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Meal worms are so very easy to breed. I use them for my geckos but on the other hand I tried super worms and they were a royal pain in the rear. I buy them in bulk from southerncricket.com and they are really nice to deal with and the prices have been good. When you get them in just put them in an old aquarium with screen top, crush unsweetened cereal, crackers, oatmeal and powdered milk, put the worms in and throw in some egg crates and veggies for moisture and away you go. So much easier but I do still breed my meal worms.

4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	Sounds like pretty normal behaviour. It should subside some in the coming days, but it never completely goes away. I still have boars that mount each other daily, but have been together over two years and otherwise are the best of friends.<br>  <br>  Before you put them all in the same cage, I highly recommend disinfecting/deodorizing the entire cage and everything in it before you do this. Be sure to do this on a day when you have plenty of time to sit nearby and watch for signs of trouble. Floortime play sessions are a completely different ballgame than a "new" pig actually invading "their" space (cage). <br>  <br>  I hope it all works out well for your piggies, but do not be surprised if you end up having two permanent cages. Many times, boar trios do not work.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YT1vOwq6aa	Whoa..... guinea pig orgy!!<br>  If i were you, i would squirt some water at them to make them stop, and to show YOU are the dominant one and won't hump them but rather do something that is annoying.

23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	I own 2 arabians and they are complete opposites of each other. Pal is 15.2hh laid back, slow, a little lazy, arrogant & proud. Manana is 14.3hh little grey, spooky, and a full throttle-a-holic. <br>  They are both very intelligent, get bored easily and prone to misbehave if they think they can get away with it. I do endurance which arabs excel at due to their stamina.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to go have a look at this horse and if you like him take him on. Its not like you are stuck with him forever. If he doesn't work for you you can always give him back or sell him on. <br>  <br>  We have a little arab on our farm who loves kids and loves to teach them to ride. He also goes to the Riding for Disabled association once a week to teach kids down there. No-one believes he's a purebred arab!<br>  <br>  Oh and definately do not listen to the answer who said arabs are dangerous jumpers. My horse Pal was a showjumper for awhile and did very well as did his father and some of his full brothers and sisters. He would have had more success but he was let down by his rider (me). In NZ some of our top show jumping ponies are arabs or part-arabs.|`|GfC98fstaa	I have been around arabians for a very long time. (17 years).

I own an arabian and she's really mellow. If I take anyone out for trail rides with me I her with them. She can be a little quirky, but all horses can just like people. My quarter horse is more high strung than my arab! I also know an arab that is EXTREMELY lazy, I mean he'll ware you out just trying to get him to trot on the trail or just pick up the walk. I've been around many arabians and they all have different temperaments and quirks just like any other breed! <br>  <br>  See if you can test the horse out before taking it. Like just ride it at the current owners house, see how it acts with all the basics, (saddling, picking it's feet, ground manners, lunging ect..) even turn it out with other horses and see how he or she acts! =] Of course I probably don't need to mention this, because you own horses, but if the horse is cool at it's former home and you wind up getting it, don't go home and suspect it to act perfect. New surroundings tend to make any horse a little naughty or spooky at first! ^^|`|UIM8X38Oaa	OH MY!  People I don't know were you get your info.<br>  <br>    Ok, I have been around lots of Arabs my whole life, they are great horses.  Yes some are more spooky then others.  But there are easy going ones as well, And they can jump, they are very versatile.  They are more sensitive which is why a lot of people give them a bad name. <br>  I have learned that a more gentle approach taken with them and they are great.  They are a very social and loving breed when they trust you they will do anything for you.   <br>    The only way you will know if the horse is right for you is to go try it <br>  out.  You never know what kind of temperament it has until you go meet the horse.  I think all breeds are pretty cool.  They all have special talents they were bred for so you won't hear me knocking them down.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Jenny<br>  <br>  Added: I had a stallion SH Phantom Echo who was of the Gainy breeding on the dam side, he was a national champion halter horse who was trained to act hot and wild in the show ring but here at home he was so sweet and easy going.  He is the one in the picture over my name.  I have worked with alot of Arabs of different lineage and it makes a difference.  CMK lines are known to be easy going and a pleasure to work with.  My point is there are great ones out there.|`|dBRxfRGqaa	my mom owns one, he's very friendly. most people will probably say that they are spooky horses in general, but there are some really good arabs out there.

Tb's tend to be spooky, and Arabians are even spookier.  Tb's are hot, Arabians tend to be hotter.  However some are pretty calm.  They make good endurance horses but are very bad jumpers.  It is a bad idea to try to jump with an Arab because their conformation makes them jump awkwardly and dangerously.

ZnZSVPztaa	Canidae, Innova, Wellness, Orijen, etc... go on dogfoodanalysis.com and choose a 6 star or 5 star food. You feed less of the expensive food than the cheap food so it balances out. For example, you might have to feed 5 cups of a cheap food but only 2 cups of a expensive, high quality food. Before you know it, you'll have to go out and buy more cheap food!|`|z2b8Y3E9aa	As far as food goes you really do get what you pay for up to a point.

fv2GAAdPaa	Cats dislike water because it makes them stink! (At least the cats think so...)<br>  <br>  Although it would seem as such, not all cats hate water. <br>  <br>  The big cats- I mean the really, really big cats, such as lions, tigers and jaguars that live in the hot weather parts of the globe- actually enjoy taking a cool dip if they get the chance. It seems to be the cats that live in colder weather areas that don't care for it too much- those would be the cougars, bobcats, snow leopards, etc; but that's because water damages their fur's ability to insulate them from the cold.<br>  <br>  Not all, but most domestic cats don't seem to care much for the wet stuff either. Some enjoy laying in a wet shower or will play with a dripping faucet but very few will actually 'join you in the tub'. The tolerance level for many cats depends on their temperament and previous experience with water. Cats that are shown in cat shows for prizes are used to being bathed regularly because they are introduced to water as kittens.<br>  <br>  It is possible that in some way, just as it is for the large cold weather cats, that water damages the ability of a cat's fur to insulate. However, if you'll notice, cats tend to bath themselves regularly with their tongue. This not only maintains the integrity of their 'insulation', but their tongue has bristles and an enzyme for an extra deep cleaning that leaves no odor, making it easier to sneak up on prey. And since cats are 'stalkers at heart' they're likely to prefer a tongue bath that masks their odor over a water bath that could make them detectable to prey.<br>  <br>  It's a shame that most cats don't like water because they're natural swimmers! In certain parts of the world, there are cats that swim to catch their own fish and cats that will swim out to meet fishing boats! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.xomba.com/tell_me_why_why_dont_cats_like_water" rel="nofollow">http://www.xomba.com/tell_me_why_why_don...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helped!<br>  <br>  =]|`|0uqsaxEqaa	Actually cats can swim if they have to, but often not particularly well. The Turkish Van breed positively enjoy swimming, as do tigers.<br>  <br>  However a thoroughly wet cat is one in danger of getting hypothermia very easily as it takes a lot of time and effort to get dry again, and cats have quite a high body temperature. Getting wet can also take the natural oils out of the coat which reduces the cat's ability to keep warm, which is one of the reasons why you shouldn't bath your cat unless it is really necessary.|`|RuepPBriaa	they can't swim,so the water scares them.they don't want to drown.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	Who says that cats don't like water or know how to swim?!?!<br>  <br>   I have a common domestic short hair female and she is first in when we go to the pond with our black lab. She is a better swimmer than the dog is. And when its time to go home we have to get the dog to chase her out of the water.<br>  <br>   Just don't try to bath her. She will rip your arm off to the shoulder.
AA11992723	according to scientific studies, the dachshund is the most aggressive dog.<br>  <br>  by law in my county, if ANY dog bites twice on record, they are taken away and evaluated.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.badrap.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.badrap.org</a><br>  <br>  Pit bulls are the chosen dogs for dogfighters to fight because of their body shape: their eyes are wide apart, their heads are large, less injury to their head so they can keep fighting longer. plus they are naturally muscular. Any dog who was subjected to a life of fighting, is unstable. It's very very sad that instead of looking with disgust at dogfighters...people look with disgust at pit bulls.....instead of trying to stop dog fighters, they would rather ban pit bulls. If pit bulls were wiped out from the face of the earth, dog fighters would choose another breed, and that breed would then take over the bad reputation pits got because of the abuse they are subjected to illegally, and the media that plays up the hype and creates fear in people.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	It would depend on how it was raised, or trained. Some are pretty complacent because they weren't taught to be mean. Others were taught to guard, fight, or attack so they wouldn't be a good match for a family with little kids. Just being a pit doesn't mean it has to be aggressive. But alot of people have thought so without knowing that fact, because the more ferocious looking a dog is, the more you automatically think it is a bad dog.  Any dog that bites will have to be contained for 10 days to see if they have rabies. They have a law in my city, that you have to register your pitbull and if you don't, they can fine you like $600 per dog.(even puppies). <br>  <br>  How long have you had your dog? You need to know the background of the dog before you go putting it around your children. Their safety is the biggest concern I would have, because some have turned on their owner due to their unknown past, and have really mutilated them or even killed a small child.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|p7swtBYzaa	Depends on the laws where you live and how severe it is, just make sure your dog is socialized and trained and doesn't bite anyone.<br>  <br>  Go for group obedience classes with your dog, really helps you learn to train and control him and helps socialize him with other dogs and new people.   It's particularly important because pits and pit mixes have such a bad reputation with some people, not necessary true, but definitely a problem.<br>  <br>  Oh Shelter - that "scientific study" that said dachshunds bite the most was a lame, non scientific questionnaire that was sent around to people.   Dachshunds don't bite any more than other breeds - I have 6 and have fostered dozens, and been barely nipped by the most terrified and stressed dogs I took in - never to do any damage, just to warn "leave me alone" out of sheer terror.<br>  <br>  Problem is, when big dogs bite, they do a lot more damage than little dogs, so those bites get in the newspaper.   All dogs need to be socialized and trained, no matter the size, but with big dogs it is particularly important - you can't just pick up a pit and say "no" the way you can a small dog.|`|fgxajTiBaa	No I don't think they're more aggressive than other Terriers. APBT were bred to have a high prey drive, as all Terriers do. People misinterpret this as human aggression, but it is anything but.<br>  <br>  No a Pitbull who bites someone is not necessarily euthanized. There are some areas, due to BSL that even owning a Pitbull consitutes it being euthanized. If a dog of any breed bites someone, they are usually put into a 10 day bite quarantine to monitor for signs of rabies or other transmitable diseases. If a dog has multiple and/or serious bites on record the dog may or may not be euthanized.|`|scdOdaTKaa	The laws are different in every area so you need to do some research on where you live and city/state laws.  It is true that pit bulls are known as an aggressive breed, does that mean all of them are...no absolutely not. I truly think it depends on the owner and hwo they are treated and raised.  I actually own and akita lab mix and Akitas don't have the best reputation, my dog wold protect us but never hurt someone that was playing or because he loses his temper.  It is all in how they are raised.

Deputies say the dogs attacked a 12-year-old boy. Family members say Dustin Bowman was riding his bike on Moore’s Farm Road. Henry County deputies were there within seconds. The Henry County Sheriff’s Office says they were already responding to a domestic dispute in the area, and those people were the owners of the pit bulls. Deputies also tell me the couple argued over the dogs because they were too much to handle. After a deputy heard Bowman scream, he ran where it happened. The sheriff’s office says one of the owners got the first dog under control. That was the dog that bit Dustin. The second dog, however, tried to attack Dustin and the deputy several times – becoming aggressive and lunging out at them. Out of safety and because it was a life-threatening situation, the deputy shot and killed the second dog.     Ten On Your Side talked to Kastina Bowman, Dustin’s mom, minutes after Dustin’s three hour surgery at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center. “He has no feeling on one side of his finger. It tore the nerve and the tendon. [Doctors] have to put screws down in his finger to hold the bone together. Part of the bone’s missing,” she said. But Dustin thought quick. His mom and deputies tell us he tried to use his bike as a shield between him and the dogs. Deputies say that helped and if he didn’t think to do that, Bowman could have suffered worse injuries. Dustin’s mom thinks it never should have happened in the first place. “A bunch of neighbors and myself have called the game warden and told them about the dogs running loose and how they chase and do growl and bark,” she said. The Sheriff’s Office says they’re investigating if those reports were filed. As for the dog, what happens to it is up to the court to decide. Dustin is listed in good condition. The Sheriff’s Office says there is no leash law in Henry County and charges are pending.<br>  <br>  Added:<br>  <br>  Two hospitalized in pit bull attack<br>  by Times News Service <br>  Friday March 06, 2009, 9:57 AM<br>  At least two people were hospitalized as a frenzied pack of dogs went on the attack just before 2 p.m. Thursday in Buena Vista Township.<br>  <br>  A police officer shot one dog and Saginaw County Animal Care Center workers captured two more.<br>  <br>  "We've got two adult victims, one male and one female, going to (St. Mary's of Michigan hospital and Covenant HealthCare), for multiple wounds," said Buena Vista Township Police Detective Kevin Kratz.<br>  <br>  "There may be another victim, but we're still trying to sort it out."<br>  Kratz said the dogs were all pit bulls or pit bull mixes.<br>  A Buena Vista patrolman fatally shot one of the animals.<br>  "It was a justifiable shooting," Kratz said.

And it depends on the situation.. if someone or some animal was coming at you and your dog was on a leash, I cannot see how anyone would make you put the dog to sleep. If you were letting your dog run around off leash and it bit someone, then you would surely be in trouble.<br>  <br>  Also, if your dog is well-mannered then you shouldn't worry about her/him biting, right?|`|TgNQAYyXaa	Pitbulls, as a rule, should not be aggressive to humans.  They are more LIKELY to be dog aggressive and early socialization is a must.<br>  <br>  If ANY breed of dog bites "someone", most provinces, states, towns, suburbs etc have laws in place that require the offending dog be destroyed.|`|k0qTaSceaa	i dont think tehy are more ggressive<br>  i have a pit/boxer and his fine with otherdogs and with strange people hs okay with them.... he was neglected in the past.... but he always plays with this other pit bull and they are fine together!! as for this one lab kept growling at my dog and a few little dogs nipped at my dog but i decided me and my dog, gottie, should keep walking<br>  but i know this is repeitive but it realy does dependon how you raise your dog.|`|rXEVEfqHaa	No its not true. <br>  <br>  Pit bulls are only aggressive if the owner trains them to be aggressive!

Hence the aggression.|`|zituIhQ2aa	if any dog bites a person they are at risk of being put to sleep... <br>  Raise your dog right and you will not have any issues... take her out so she can get use to new people and animals...|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	No.  But I do believe there are WAY too many irresponsible people making them that way.|`|z2b8Y3E9aa	Terriers in general where created to hunt or flush small animal like rats (hence rat terrier).  Like most people will tell you it does matter a lot how they are raised, but they need to be socialized carefully and early if possible.  Your sister is part right, because of the pit bull reputation, if a pit bull bites someone, they are more likely to be but down compared to say a poodle biting someone.  Even if your dog is on a leash, you are still responsible for its behavior.  I own a pit mix myself.  Now I don't necessarily agree with breed specific legislation but we have to be responsible owners, if you think your dog might be dog aggresive, don't test it out by confronting your dog with another one.  If your dog might be people aggressive, don't let little kids (or anyone for that matter) run up to your dog and stick their face in your dogs space.  That is how people get bit.  My advice is learn what you can from a reputable source, (not your second cousin's ex wife's brother).  Be responsible, and give your dog as much exercise as you can.  Dogs sometimes become frustrated by lack of stimulation and exercise and act out in ways we view as aggressive.  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|UW9Trvrpaa	Yes it is true that if a dog bites someone they might have to be put down. Also if the injury is serious the owner will be held responsible.<br>  But, do not let that bother you. It is not necessarily true about Pitbulls being aggressive but each dog has a different personality. Some dogs are trained to be aggressive for it's task.<br>  Just remember to keep it on a leash when it goes out.|`|ZWGgRFZkaa	no i dont think pits are any kind of dog can be aggressive its the way u raise them and the owner and enviroment i have a full blooded and 2 mix ones and 2 other dogs and they all get along. and am not sure if its true but it is sad cuz its all the owners fault the pup is raised from the owner and if that the way the owner raised the pup to be aggressive then the owner sud get in touble and not the pits|`|01AdxToLaa	I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE LAW STATES THAT UNLESS THERE ARE DIFFERENT LAWS IN EACH STATE.

ZN686EhIaa	There is nothing too wrong with Parelli. There is good and bad bits in all this 'horsemanship' stuff. The one thing that will happen though, is that your emotional relationship with your horse WILL CHANGE. Don't expect your horse to be the same horse you have now. Your relationship will be different. These training methods tend to be all or nothing. Give it all and it will probably be fabulous, go in half hearted and you will end up with a stuffed up friendship that may never go back to how it was. Want to take the risk?|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Complete waste of money.  Seriously, that guy charges $60 for a rope halter and a leadrope... SCAM ARTIST!  <br>  <br>  Plus it does more harm than good to many horses.  I've met tons of horses who can play all seven games but don't know how to do a lead change!   I'd never buy a NH trained horse because they don't know anything about being ridden... all they know how to do is play games!  Sure, you can throw a tarp over it, but what good does that do you in the real world?|`|5QG9Zrjaaa	Pat is quite a salesman.  I also think he is a horseman himself, and he has done some interesting things with the "games" but his followers seem to take it all way too literally.  Many of the handling methods do help a fairly novice person stay reasonably safe with a horse in the backyard with limited or no weekly or monthly professional training except for the videos.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	I like some of Parelli's training methods but you'd do a LOT better going with John Lyons, Monty Roberts or Natural Horsemanship. Parelli's training system insists that their system is the best for your horse no matter what, everything else is wrong, and they use a lot of really wierd gadgets that make no sense.|`|6GehblM3aa	Don't waste your money on Parelli.  You don't need to spend millions of dollars on a rope halter, a carrot stick, and magic rope to bond with your horse.

My horse has much more respect for me, and listens for what I ask. He is not FORCED into it by using (spurs whips etc) he loves and wants to do his job.|`|IWaxUqDzaa	It's not my kind of thing, but I know lots of people who like the methods.....|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	I like Parelli, though I think it's pretty expensive, and is a 'lifestyle' choice in regards to how you want to 'be' with your horse.<br>  It's not so much about training the horse, as training the handler to behave in a different way to get good results.<br>  <br>  I've used NH techniques for many years and find them fantastic for building a raport with the horses I train. I don't subscribe entirely to the Parelli method though.<br>  <br>  I should point out that it was Pat Parelli who coined the term "Natural Horsemanship", though it now encompases many forms of similar ways of working with horses.<br>  <br>  I'd point out also that Monty Roberts is a total shamdog. Can't stand the man (worked behind the scenes at his earlier UK demos, that man is a monster to horses)...|`|EQvAbyvcaa	Parelli methods are phenomenal and will work with every horse in every situation.  However, it will not work for every human and that is where the negative comments come in.  If you are willing to learn and teach yourself, then you can achieve any level of success you desire using natural horsemanship.  But I would encourage you to look at several of the NH advocates.  See what they have to offer and pick and choose what you think is best suited for you and your horse.  I took a dangerous horse and with work and consistence and building trust and respect, he follows me around all the time.  He will leave the other others to walk across the pasture to greet me.  I can step up on a mounting block and point and he will position his body perfectly so I can step on.  He has become an amazing horse.  He had a very un-horsey life before but he was not able to  perform well enough for the owners to recover his $125,000 price tag.    When I saw him, I saw behind the protecting/attacking behavior and knew what it was and where it was coming from.  I saw the marvelous animal and athlete that he is.  He will always be a challenging horse and I love that quality because he is so very smart , but now that I have attained an advanced ability to deal with and help horses, in various situations, it is not a big deal.  You need the right equipment, timing and balance and consistency as well as lots of time.  Horses learn quickly,  Just make sure you are asking the right questions so they don't learn the wrong thing.  If this sounds like something you could be interested in accomplishing with your horse, go for it.  If you put in the time to control yourself, you can improve the communication and respect levels between you and your horse.  Your horse already knows all this stuff, he just has to learn how to do things when you ask and then understand that you will never hurt him or put him in danger.  Initial level in Parelli is totally about safety and that makes perfect sense,   <br>  It is a great method if you are serious and want to achieve the utmost advancement in your abilities and riding with your horse.  good luck.|`|GfC98fstaa	Everyone at my barn uses the Parelli training method, minus myself and maybe 3-4 others. I do not use Parelli, or natural horsemanship programs or (as we call it) "extreme aggressive cowboy training." I take what I need from all types of training.<br>  <br>  I use the sweetness and understanding method towards my horse when he is being spooky, or when I'm just giving him affection. I do not, however, think it is okay to let my horse rear and buck at me on a lunge line and do nothing about it as say, "Good boy.", like Parelli trainers do. <br>  <br>  I use punishments on my horse when he is bad, (spin him in tight circles and kick him and do a exercise over til he gets it right) unlike A TON of Parelli trainers. Though I do not beat my horse when he is bad. I do not use a stud chain (he is a gelding), wear spurs, whip him over and over, and a lot of bunch of other things. In my opinion, I think Parelli trainers are stupid non-punishment whatsoever people. And extreme cowboy trainers and insensitive, cruel people.<br>  <br>  I would suggest not just doing one program, learn as much as you can from all types of trainer. Mix it up, and find out what works for you and your horse. Not every horse can do Parelli and neither can every person.|`|qoL7LTIUaa	its good stuff but i know alot of people who take it too far and are also very annoying because they try to work with their horses when there are other people in the ring who are trying train their horses so if you choose to do it work when people are their but nobody is sharing the ring with you<br>  i think the smart thing to do is not necessarily take away their exact examples that they show but what would be much better would be to take away the state of mind that the parelli people have and the patience they use along with the importance of groundwork and bonding with ur horse<br>  good luck and i give it a thumbs up|`|IWP0gop5aa	I don't know much about PARELLI, but I LOVE horsemanship methods and Remedies etc. Try join-up (Monty Roberts). It's great! I've never done it becaus there simply is no-where to do it at my yard with my pony, but as soon as I can I will!|`|dBRxfRGqaa	people say it's a waste of money, but you really don't have to spend much. you can use a normal rope halter and other substitutes, so it's not a waste of money if you use it wisely. the methods are great. it focuses all on the relationship of the horse an rider and teaches the rider to be an effective leader. it's amazing, i couldn't be happier with it.|`|CoAc5hS9aa	I am not into the parelli stuff. I mean for some people it works and that is fantastic but I have never has success with them. I prefer modern techniques. I will not pay $30 for a 'carrot stick' (a.k.a a whip, yes it IS a whip). I will go to the store and buy a $5 lounge whip, thank you very much. I am not into it at all. I don't know anyone who is.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	I personally dont like him. I dont think you should be playing games with a 1200 pound animal. (Yes, I know a lot of horses are smaller or bigger but you get the idea). I think there are much better ways of gaining respect and trust. Im more of the older style, not the beat your horse into submission but, I refuse to play "games" with my horse to get what I want. I am direct and consistent and they all learn just fine that way. I like Clinton Anderson and John Lyons much better. Both have great things to teach and do it in a way that keeps you safe. Ive seen a few of Parellis "lessons" and none of the horses look happy. They all have their ears pinned back and they looks really upset. Do whats best for your horse but I would keep looking.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Just because some of us refuse to use Parelli, doesnt mean we see them as a business. Sure, I train and show but that doesnt mean I dont have a great relationship with my horses and its never been forced. I find the best way to build a relationship is spending time grooming and working with the horse. You still need discipline, not games. Its more of a safety issue than anything. They outweigh me by a lot and if Id rather have a horse that respected me rather than "plays games" with me.|`|a53golMMaa	I think some of the things in the Parelli training methods can be very helpful to you and your horse. Different things work for different horses. You will find their methods teach your horse how to really pay attention and connect with you.  All of the games in some way represent real live things that may happen on the trail or around home. Think about it, it is better that your horse knows how to do all of this stuff even if it seemed useless at the time you taught it.<br>   Personally, I use a mix of all methods,|`|7vnpJpE2aa	it's funny...because the people that don't like parelli or any natural horsemanship (nh) system are the "show" people. if you look at the intentions of a show rider/trainer, they are in the horse world strictly for themselves. horses are NOT meant to prance around in circles and live in stalls. the people who respect the idea of nh are the people who want to truly connect with their horse and want to EARN their horse's respect rather than DEMANDING it. when you have a sincere relationship with a horse (that you are not just trying to breed/train/ride specifically to sell for top dollar) you don't care if it can do "lead changes." so...i guess if you think of horses as a business, parelli isn't for you, but if you plan to spend the rest of a horse's life with it and you want to be its friend, you should definitely check out parelli, or any nh system. good luck! :)|`|vGSKe2sKaa	Pointless. You waste your money on special "sticks" and waste time with stupid games. Horses were fine before Parelli came about and trust me your horse will be fine without it.|`|F0oWWCLQaa	the only Parelli related things me and my horse do are the 7 games and he really likes them :)

If so depends on the amount of grass compared to supplementary feeding, rugs - chances on depending on whereabouts in the uk you are but they will probably be required. Again it all depends on how much work it will be required to do. If in doubt corn merchants/feed suppliers are usually more than happy to advise with feeding requirements. Thoroughbreds can be pricey to keep but cheap to buy - tho I have known some that were very resilient to cheap keeping, it just depends. Rubbish answer I know but it gives you a few ideas of what to keep an eye on. Good weather can mean cheap costs for one year and double costs the next if it is harsh, but your local feed supplier is always a good place to start as they see horse owners day in day out.|`|jUPtm90oaa	breed of horse does make a difference in price. thoroughbreds and arabs horse breeds like those need more care and attention than native breeds like fells/dales/highlands.<br>  i used to have a 15.3hh tb mare and noway did she cost me ten grand a year lol! it depends where you keep them.

IrdZKYT3aa	You're doing good so far on cycling the tank, also consider using some of the filter media in the new one, as well as this will be covered in beneficial bacteria.  In fact, switching the original filter to the new tank very nearly negates cycling at all.<br>  Just be aware the longer you wait with no waste input the more likely you are to start losing the bacteria, it needs the ammonia waste the fish produce keeps them alive, in an empty tank, they'll start to die.<br>  I'd probably toss in some fish food to feed the bacteria for the first 24-48 hours before placing him in.  This'll keep the bacteria alive but allow the tank to settle before you place him in.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|1orBemFyaa	you still might wanna wait a little, maybe a little less than a week.  but it sounds like you know what your doing, so good job.  best of luck!|`|ZJCbnlF3aa	At least 48 hours so everything can get going and the beneficial bacteria can build up on everything.

The established water will help speed up and control the nitrogen cycle, but without a constant source of ammonia (ie: fish pooping in your tank) the beneficial bacteria you added from your established tank will die, and then there will have been no point in doing that.<br>  <br>  Just be sure to start testing ammonia levels on the third day after adding fish, and test them every day until the level goes down to zero.

Ff7mCzlPaa	Huskies are high-energy independent dogs who make good pets for those who lead a very active lifestyle and have time to take them out to run every day, without fail.<br>  <br>  Bored huskies chew anything they can find, dig, climb fences, and can be destructive.  Not because they are bad dogs, but because they have not had the opportunity to expend energy.<br>  <br>  Huskies can make wonderful pets.  They are actually clowns... they like to "talk" quite often too.   They are very trainable, and it takes hard work an perseverance to train them, but it can be worthwhile in the long run.<br>  <br>  Huskies do well if they are taught to pull carts or sleds.  They love to run and work.<br>  <br>  You can find out more information about huskies as pets by doing a yahoo search.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|dl1OOOT8aa	It's hard to find alaskan huskies outside their native state, Alaska. From what I know, they were never bred to be family house dog. Only good working drives and suitable temperaments (cannot be vicious towards people). They can probably run 20 miles every day and never get tired. I would say they are VERY high maintenance sort of dog. Without any work, they will become bored, hyper, and destructive.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Alaskan huskies are NOT siberian huskies or alaskan malamutes. They are just sled dogs.|`|AA10863966	OK are you really talking about a Alaskan husky?<br>  they are a type not a breed and are bred to be amazing athletes, and are working animals.<br>  <br>  If you are, in fact, talking about an Alaskan then I can tell you that they are not typically aggressive, or mean. They have been bred for generations to work with humans, and as such are usually very intelligent and tuned in to their human pack mate. And they will require an outlet for thier work drive. It is not only phsyical, yes they do need lots of physical activity, but it is also mental, they enjoy a task. So if you can participate in activities with them, sledding is the obvious, but there is also agility, bike-jour, canicross and clicker training.<br>  <br>  Huskies have some adaptations to help them deal with the extreme cold they are bred for. So you want to make sure you live in a climate where they can live comfortably, or that you make living conditions hospitable for your northern working dog. Many are more comfortable living outside. An organization called Mush With Pride has some good information on working with sled dogs in a kennel situation,  but you might find it helpful:<br>  <a href="http://www.mushwithpride.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mushwithpride.org/</a><br>  <br>  They are really tuned into humans and work well with us. But they really were bred to be working dogs, and will require a lot of activity to fill that need.<br>  <br>  Also as pets you should know they have a think undercoat, and that means shedding, lots and lots of shedding. WE use brushes, but also use a 'shedding blade'  sold at tack stores for horses.<br>  <br>  People I know who work with Siberians often comment on how their dogs can't be trusted loose and run away when they get the chance. But that has not been my experience with Alaskans. Although they can have a high prey drive. They do chew, they do dig, and I have never found a way to keep them off the couch when I am not looking (told you they were smart)<br>  <br>  If you have enough secured outside space and lead an active lifestyle then a sled dog may be a good choice for you. And if you are serious, then can I suggest you consider adopting a husky that is not making or is retired from a racing team. These dogs are well socialized and are used to crowds and new situations. <br>  <br>  But no not expect this to be a dog that can be left at home all day and will be happy to see you and then go be quite all night. They are used to be in a working relationship with their human so they expect you to be too.<br>  <br>  I am not sure where you are at, but you can look up local mushing groups to meet mushers who may have dogs to rehome. Or you can find dogs through sled dog rescue organizations like the Second Chance League<br>  <a href="http://members.petfinder.org/~AK17/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://members.petfinder.org/~AK17/index...</a>|`|FNdsPNrJaa	If you have a nice BIG backyard they are fine.

TSc8OE4vaa	Yes, I own an off-track thoroughbred who was always ridden in a snaffle bit.  She was fine at the walk and trot, but hard to stop at the canter.  I tried many many bits, and the best of those was a french-link snaffle but it wasn't perfect- she still tossed her head a bit and was generally a pain to stop.<br>  <br>  After about a year of owning her, I swapped to a bitless bridle and it made a huge difference!  She is now easy to stop and 100% under my control at all times with the bitless bridle.  She even bends more easily and gets a better headset with the bitless bridle.  I use Dr. Cook's bitless, too.<br>  <br>  She's now a happier horse in general, too.  Before she was always a pain to catch, because she hated having the bit in her mouth and so she'd avoid being caught so she wouldn't have to be ridden.  Now, she waits for me at the gate!  It is easy to see that my horse is a lot happier without the bit.<br>  <br>  However, not all horses react the same to a bitless bridle.  Make sure you have someone walking along next to you when you first try it, so that if he doesn't understand your cues someone can grab him and you can hop off.  My horse understood it just fine the first time but they don't all react the same way.<br>  <br>  The great thing about Dr. Cook's bridles is that they let you send them back with a full refund for one month... so if after 3 weeks you decide that it doesn't work for you, you can send it back to them, no questions asked, and they will refund all of your money.<br>  <br>  Bridle sizes come in only a few sizes: Mini, pony, cob, horse, and draft.  I am 90% sure your horse will wear a "horse" size bridle.  They then have straps which you must adjust to fit it exactly.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	The Dr. Cook works very well for these horses. However, if the horse won't stop on a bit, you probably have a training issue as much as a bit issue.  Many horses respond beautifully to going bitless, but if the horse is poorly trained to the aids, a bitless bridle is not a miracle cure that can replace training. <br>   If you decide to try bitless, you can go to the Dr. Cook Bitless Bridle website (their own site) and you will find measuring instructions for fitting the bridle.  In the meantime, work on desensitizing the horse to tactile stimulation all over his face.  You will have to use a measuring tape on him in order to determine the size you need.|`|7vnpJpE2aa	I just got one for my horse! so far so good, although i have found i do have to use a bit more muscle than i had hoped to...but at least she is happier! as far as stopping in a canter, try doing it as you normally would (pull back and voice command) and if he doesn't respond immediately, correct it by grabbing one rein and pulling his head to one side. he will have to stop. eventually, he will learn to listen to your first command to avoid being pulled off course. as far as the measurement goes...it's not a bad idea to try touching his head. just make sure he's not confined where he would panic if you startle him. approach him slowly and do it naturally, meaning don't grab his halter and make him stay still while you invade his space. offer treats. and be gentle. maybe do that a couple of days, then use a string to tie around his head and then measure the string. it's a good way to bond with him and get to know each other. if you need help, don't be shy to ask whoever is available! :)
oDVx7nSxaa	Yep, when they neuter a cat they just make a very small incision in the scrotal sack to pull out the "contents".  No stitches are required, as they don't make any cuts into the body cavity. It heals pretty quickly.   I've never, ever had a male with a cone - they put the cones on animals to keep them from tearing out stitches.  i say ditch the cone - feeding problem solved ;o)|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Most times the males don't need a cone.  Maybe take the cone off when you are feeding him.  Then put it back on.|`|nQdGGBN4aa	Everyone that says a cone (also called an E Collar or an Elizabethan Collar) is not needed for a neutered male is absolutely correct.<br>  <br>  Over the years we have had 14 male cats neutered and none of them tried to chew or otherwise damage the incision site.<br>  <br>  We've spayed 5 females and had no problems with them.<br>  <br>  Spaying is major surgery to remove the uterus and ovaries - like a hysterectomy.<br>  <br>  Neutering is a simple procedure, as someone said, of a small incision in the scrotum to allow access to the testicles so that they can be removed.<br>  <br>  We had one male who had only one testicle descended. The vet had to make a very small abdominal incision to get at the un-descended testicle and even then the cat, named Tanner, didn't bother the incision site.<br>  <br>  Take the cone off and watch him for a while. If he does try to chew at the incision site, put the cone back on him - I really doubt it will be necessary.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I have 6 neutered males and two spayed females.  I have never used a cone with any of them and they all did just fine.  You can remove the cone if it's annoying him (which it probably is). Males don't get stitches because the incision is so small.  It will heal on it's own very quickly. Your guy will be fine.  Thanks for being responsible.|`|lc2WYfeTaa	Wow, your vet sounds like a real dumb***!!! I have 2 cats who are neutered..neither of them had a cone and they usually put stitches on the inside not the outside!! But, if he didn't put any at all??!!! Try taking the cone off for awhile and letting him eat..although he may not be hungry due to anesthesia and pain!! Honestly me being an animal lover I would be finding me a new vet, but I would also see if you can have someone inspect his vet office for malpractice and other things like that!!! He just seems sketchy!! Good luck and I hope your kitty feels better!!|`|4HhYhxwjaa	MEEEEEEOOOOWWWWWWWWWWW!!

The boxer had one of these so-called no pull collars on and he was still dragging his owner all around on the tv show about food. It was pretty pathetic and proved to me that this one didn't work. But I digress. <br>  <br>  So I got the gentle leader at pets mart for about 16 bucks. it comes with a DVD with everything you need to know in order to train him to wear it. Its amazing. I can take my dog anywhere now. <br>  Go for the gentle leader head collar!|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	lol ive been there tried that and from my opinion dont or wont work for long. best thing is a correction/choke chain they soon sort any dog out|`|QVP8zSuWaa	You will have much more control with a collar. A plain old chain choke collar and a short lead gives you great control. Place the collar directly behind the ears. Start walking, as soon as the dog starts to break give a quick snap and release, stop and put him back in position
zqVDJxUIaa	Yes, that's quite normal. Most saltwater starfish, like any other 'fish' need about a week to get used to their habitat and surroundings. Starfish can get stressed too! Give it a week or so, and I'm sure it will explore your aquarium further. Maybe there's some nutritious micro-organisms clinging to the glass, which your starfish might like.<br>  <br>  God Luck!|`|qeOlkRM0aa	That's common. Most starfish like to be on a solid surface, and the glass is as good as anything.
RN1wGlWWaa	No home with pets should be without Bitter Apple Spray.  You can get it in Petco or Petsmart.  It works great to stop them from chewing on cords.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, then you might need the heavy duty plastic tubes to run the cords thru.|`|0dCOJQiwaa	Get the cat euthanized.|`|e31se8p1aa	I've read that if you rub some laundry detergent on them, she won't like the taste. How DUMB?! It's just like drinking soap! Don't do it. You can tape them, rub petroleum jelly on them, clap your hands when she chews them, or put double sided tape on the floor in front of the wires. When she walks there, she'll hate the way her paws feel. Or block it with cans, bottles, a gate, or cardboard boxes. Make it impossible for her to jump over them and land in front of them, or just impossible, period. She can get electricuted, which I assume you're aware of.|`|DvjbTNXvaa	keep her away from it,and try to teach her not to do so if she is still very young<br>  otherwise just add some flavor on the cords which she does not like<br>  :)|`|WzFWkOH5aa	put a flavor on them that the cat does not like (ex lemonjuicee)|`|oLtcvloxaa	get its teeth removed
IrdZKYT3aa	Temps: Goldie preferred temps range from 65-70, ideal is 68.  They don't do well heated, and can actually be stressed in warm waters, it also increases their metabolism, somthing you don't want to do with goldies and thier intestinal issues.<br>  <br>  Feedings:  Goldies really need to be border line underfed, they can and will eat themselves sick.  Once a day or every other day is best and only a pinch or so.  B/c of the internal structure of the fancy goldfish, they're very prone to bloat, intestinal blockadges, internal knotting and swim/float bladder disease.  Make sure to have some peas on hand at all times. (the insides of a cooked and cooled pea can do wonders for thier tummies!)  Make sure they eat it all (the food), left over food will rot and create waste.  I recommend crisps or pellets over flakes, as they're cleaner.  Flakes powder into little bits of dust too small for the fish to eat, and just dirties the tank.  Crisps and pellets are swallowed whole and create a lot less mess.<br>  <br>  Veggies:  Yes they love veggies and fruit!  Were I work, we toss in a sliced orange occasionally and let it float, they love to eat the fleshy middle out. With lettuce and spinach, b/c they'll have problems tearing it, I'd shred it before adding it.  With peas, the inside meat isn't tough enough to pose a problem.<br>  <br>  Vision:  Watch them move, if they're having difficulty navigating and finding their food, somethings wrong.  Also, check the condition of the eye, is it clear?  Any white clouds, or milky covering, swelling or redness is a bad sign.  I'd also be very careful with telescope goldies and avoid bubble eyed Goldie's all together.<br>  <br>  Also, watch thier fins, they're long fancy tails are prone to fin rot.  If they start to look mushy, white, frayed or laced, get meds ASAP, the sooner you jump on this the better.<br>  Blackening of the ends, like you held it to a lighter, is not fin rot, this is amonia burns, something else their fins are prone to show.  Ammonia poisoning and burns are very seriouse as they usually strike the inner gills first before it becomes evident on the outer body.  Basically burning them away and slowly killing the fish, a good way to spot this is bright red gills.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|dQ0LpBiZaa	i don't think you need to heat your aquarium, like fancy tropical fishes need. I have three goldfish and I've had them for three years(still living), and I never worried much about temperature. Just remember to put in a few drops of water conditioner every time you change the water. I feed my goldfish and koi fish flakes. I've heard that really big koi fish eat slices of bread. Dont feed handfuls of food, just a small pinch of goldfish food. The key to having your goldfish live as long as possible(usually ten years) is to clean the tank properly. their gills release a lot of harmful toxins, and you know, they release their own wastes in their home.|`|9ycJ261daa	dear as long as the water is room temp they will be fine.Gold fish are not really tropical but some are. I take you have just regular goldfish. Go to your local pet store they have a supply of goldfish food and you are to feed only once a day. Do not feed frozen veggies or spinach its not good for them. There is no way to tell if your fish are visually impaired. In the long run plz go to your local pet shop and get a book on raising goldfish as well as their food. Goldfish are the easiest to raise. good luck.|`|gfm3fQubaa	take the gold fishes back and get gold fish|`|oLtcvloxaa	Stick them where the sun doesn't shine|`|7PHKYCKDaa	idk what your asking.....?|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	I dont know how to tell if they are tropical or cold water fish. if they are cold water then put in an air pump so the water is oxygenated and that sit really. just keep the tank clean and when you clean it theres a chemical you can put in that treats the water cos its just come from a tap which isnt really that good for a fish. The ammount of food you give them depends on the size of your fish. feed them twice a day. if you're giving froxen vegetables you probably need to chop it up so they can eat it but they are pretty good at pulling leaves apart probs chop them up aswell though, or put a plant in that you can get from a pet shop, you'll be able to tell if they're really hungry if they start devouring the plant, normally they just take a nibble now and again.|`|bMnBDVQBaa	Hello.  I wish you would have researched a bit better before you got these fish because you could potentially KILL them but I'll help you out anyway.<br>  <br>  1.)  Best temperature for goldfish is anywhere from 64-75F.  This is meaning that if the water were to drop to 64, they would not die from shock but ideally for goldfish, I would recommend 70-75F.<br>  <br>  2.)  If your fish are actual goldfish...not just based on their color but by the TYPE that they are, they are not tropical fish.  Tropical fish are mollys, guppies, platys, tiger barbs, tetras...etc.<br>  <br>  3.)  When you feed golfish, I have found that they love the flakes so if you have pellets, I would return them.  I use a dropper and moisten the flakes first so they don't float on the top of the water which could cause fish to intake air and this could "blow them up".  Give them no more than they can eat in 30 seconds and if they are still scurrying around like they are hungry, give them a tad bit more.  Overfeeding is a problem, especially with new fish owners and they don't know how much to feed.<br>  <br>  4.)  Get a zucchini and cut a little slice and stick it in the gravel or get a vegetable clip from the store.  Only leave it in for about 4 hours, whether it is eaten or not.  This degrades the water quality if kept in overnight.<br>  <br>  5.)  What do you mean, are your fish visually impaired?  Do they "have" their eyes?  Are they running into the side of the tank?  If they have an odd swimming behavior like swimming upside down, seizuring, swimming sideways...they may actually have something wrong with them like a bacterial infection like Ich or they may have shock from the water temperature or the water quality.<br>  <br>  If you have any more questions, feel free to e-mail me groovy_sd@yahoo.com

4b5106290d0dd7b8527192088f2ec6b6aa	You said "another", so I'm going to assume you already have one. If this is the case, your new piggie will learn by watching the other one.<br>  <br>  If your other piggie is in a separate cage, put the cages close together so the new piggie can see what the other one is doing & learn that way.<br>  <br>  Piggies catch on to the water bottle fairly quickly, so don't worry yourself too much.|`|8to6MsWuaa	Don't worry, it's instict for a guinea pig to know how to use a water bottle, but just to be safe, i would leave out a dish of water just like they do at the pet store.|`|I7XLVVhEaa	leave a dish of water out my hamster did the same thing all his life and i just needed to change the water more often good luck
8Ymsx4Oraa	Yes, its very good for growing fry. The key in moderation and can not be the base of their diet.

fgxajTiBaa	If I found a dog for me at both a kill AND a non kill shelter, I would adopt from the kill shelter first.<br>  <br>  My current pooch is from a high kill gassing shelter in NC. Their shelter posts their dogs on that website.|`|2u8teJkJaa	Yes, I would. These are shelter dogs. My first thought was when they tell you the euth date you would feel sorry for them and adopt them but there is a notice in red not to adopt for that reason.|`|Y6xanshEaa	Absolutely,they all seem like great dogs. I'm sure any of them would fit me.<br>  Now,if only they were all in the same shelter..<br>  <br>  On death row,how sad. ;__; Someone adopt them!|`|3p3otDlXaa	I guess.  Why only several days left?|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	There are probably just as many great dogs down the street in your local shelter.<br>  <br>   While it is sad that so many dogs are euthanized in the southern shelters, there are often dogs near you in just as much trouble.  It makes no sense to do the animal equivalent of ambulance chasing, when you can find a local dog that will quite frankly be just as dead.<br>  <br>    Check on Petfinder.com and see what is available.  You will probably find a lot to choose from, without risking exposure to parvo and other things that can frequent some of these shelters.<br>  <br>    There are some rescuers who do a truly heroic job of quarantine, temperament testing and transport, but it only makes sense when there are truly more homes than dogs in an area, and you may find a dog already there.|`|8to6MsWuaa	Yeah, i probably would if i found a dog that seemed to have everything i was looking for. Only thing that would be a neggetive is not meeting your dog before you adopt it, like you do at local shelters.|`|Wt61EclRaa	Yes!  Absolutely! what a shame.  This is why people should spay and neuter their pets. When will people learn?  So sad.  Let us know which adorable doggy you go with.  How sweet you are.

We have a rescued Labrador.
AA11584048	Herefords are known for being very docile. But it all depends on the specific animal, so you should be sure to become the cow's primary source of feed and water.  And spend lots of time with her and she'll bond with you.|`|I38WF5aFaa	For dairy cows jerseys and gurnseys are very easy to work with and have great personalities.  Holsteins produce more milk but they are big and stupid.

1WmDOPGtaa	Dogs are considered to be color blind but they do not see in black and white.  Like people who are color blind, they can perceive colors but often cannot differentiate them.  Chances are their perception of color is less vibrant than even a color blind person's, but it is not as simple as "black and white."|`|KxjUim7yaa	Dogs are Colorblind is folklore. They are unable to see the color red, but can see other colors and lavender,blue and green. They see black and white things better than we do and in more limited light, but they also see some color. They would appreciate blue toys. If you have a red ball for your dog, he may not see it on the grass.|`|Kt0qVNZOaa	Dogs can see color. A long time ago scientists claimed that dogs only see black and white but they've been proven wrong. Dogs can indeed see color!<br>  <br>  While scientists have changed their mind about the black and white thing, they now say that dogs can see color but supposedly not every color. I'm sure in a few more years they will have to eat crow again.

6ok6SKjxaa	I think she'll be fine, just leave some of her favorite food out for her. She will eat it when she's ready. If she doesn't eat still, she could just be getting over it, and when your sick, you don't eat, and i think it's probably the same for her... as she just got surgery. Atleast she's drinking and wont get dehydrated.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	She's probably still getting over the whole thing. Most of my cats were fine after a couple of days but Allie hid in the closet for a week.  I had to bring food and water to her.  If your kitty isn't better within 3 days of surgery, call the vet.  Make sure her suture isn't swollen or seeping and just let her rest. Thanks for having her spayed.|`|0uqsaxEqaa	She has just had major surgery, so she is likely to feel groggy and in pain for a while. Humans who have a hysterectomy are off work for 3 months, so don't expect her to be leaping around straight away... it will take a day or two at least. Having endured a general anaesthetic myself fairly recently I can say that I felt awful for a day, and certainly not right for another 2 days after that :)<br>  <br>  As long as she is drinking, her gums aren't really pale coloured, the wound is clean and not weeping, and she isn't in obvious distress leave her be, she'll eat when she's ready.
5TM9P8tsaa	*I do not believe in crates except for night time or if you are gone from the house. Once they are potty trained the crate should be gotten rid of or put in storage. Maybe you are not ready for a puppy. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Every time the puppy drinks you should go out with the puppy and tell them to go pee pee. When it does pee pee you say good boy/girl. All my dogs can pee on command. It takes only a few months to teach them. If you are not willing to go out with the dog, find it a new home and get a cat instead.|`|2u8teJkJaa	You should be feeding only 2 times a day. 6 am and 6 pm would work well..

ef60cd3f7d9f8fefe93008353c82e121aa	The highest quality food for ferrets is EVO(cheapest at ferret.com).  I noticed that their coats became much thicker, they seemed happier, and more energetic.  Plus my girls go nuts over the taste!  It's a must have as it well exceeds the established nutrional minimums for a ferrets diet.  <br>  <br>  The lowest, well I'm not sure because I don't buy them any low grade foods.  However, carbs are cheaper and not recommended..so anything with high carbs will most likely equate to cheap food.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind it's always good to have 3 different brands of foods(EVO, Totally Ferret, and Zupreem) and mix and match em.  They need a little variety too.  (Totally Ferret has different flavors too).<br>  <br>  One more thing(Off Topic).  Most people don't realize that you actually save money by buying high quality foods because a) they eat less of it and b)  are more healthy...(longer life/less vet visits).  It's something to consider.|`|fU06Qre9aa	Like the previous poster said, there is no perfect food, and there is a lot of debate about the very best food.<br>  <br>  I personally feed my ferrets Innova EVO Ferret, Totally Ferret Active, and 8-in-1 Ultimate, although I think that Zupreem, Wysong, and The Ferret Store (now Drs. Foster and Smith) are great foods too.  In fact, I used to have The Ferret Store in my mix until they were bought out by Drs.

Another important thing to remember is that simply because a products says, "ferret" on it does not make it better than all kitten/cat foods. Also brand name does not mean a thing, it is the nutritional make up, quality & actual ingredients that make the difference.<br>  <br>  First lets talk about the nutritional make up. Ferrets require a protein level of 32% to 38%, mid range is best. A protein content of over 38% could prove to be harmful for the kidneys of an older ferret. The protein should come from animal sources, not plant or vegetable sources. Ferrets also require a high fat content of 20% to 22%; this also should come from animal sources. Ash content should be no more than 7% to avoid the formation of kidney stones. You should also keep the fiber content at 3% or lower. As your ferret gets older you may want to bring these level to the low end of the scale, as he will not require the same levels as a younger ferret
CexnhuDUaa	It takes a Leopard Gecko about 1-2 days to shed. They will peel there skin of with their mouths, and eat it. An adult Leopard Gecko sheds about once every 4-6 weeks, so I do believe yours has shed before, you just didn't realize it. When they are about to shed, they look a lot lighter than usual, and then the next day they will revert back to their normal, vibrant colors. You won't see any of the old skin, as they do eat it.<br>  <br>  Your gecko should have gotten the shed off by now. S/he shed all over when s/he did, it just hasn't gotten the shed off of it's leg. Make sure you have a moist hide for the gecko to go into when it sheds. This can be done by putting a wet paper towel into something, like a big butter tub, tuperware, or anything else you can find, cutting a hole in it, so the gecko can get in, and placing it on the hot end of the terrarium. The gecko will go into this when it needs, usually while shedding. <br>  <br>  You should mist some water onto the gecko wherever it has shed left over, to aid with shedding. If you want, you can buy shed-aid at the store, but only use this when the gecko is having trouble shedding. You can also GENTLY massage the shed to try to help peel it off, but don't peel it off roughly, as this can cause damage to the new skin. <br>  <br>  I hope s/he's ok!!|`|sUN7TVtzaa	it takes about a day. ours start in the evening and in the morning they are done. if yours is 7 months old i garrentee you he has shed before. their first shed is about at 5 days old. after that they will begin to eat small food items. then they will probably shed about once a month especially as they are growing but they conitue shedding throughout their lives. <br>  i don't think yours is shedding, do you have a moist hide with wet paper towel in his cage? he needs a high humidity hide in his cage to help with shedding.|`|01nMRPHVaa	It normally takes about a day or two, depending on the humidity, and whether or not the have a method of getting it off. <br>  <br>  Once it starts to peel off, they sometimes use their teeth, and will eat the skin. It's ok though, because it has nutritional value<br>  <br>  -MB

GT6396BDaa	It sounds like your female dog is competing for your husband's attention.  It's like when 2 women fight over a man's attention.<br>  It's not that she does not like you, in fact she loves you since you both get along great when your husband is not around, so you and your husband need to show your dog that your husband loves both of you and she doesn't need to compete for his sole attention.<br>  There are different ways to do it.  You can both take your dog for walks or play in the backyard together.  You and your husband need to make a point of touching and being close, and at the same time, giving love and attention to your dog.  Everyone could sit on the ground and just relax with your dog there and if she growls at you if go to touch your husband, then both of you should tell her no.  Then both of you should pet her, with you and your husband sitting close to each other.<br>  You will need to do this a few times, and when she acts good and does not growl or act out, then give her a treat.  It will show your dog that she doesn't have to compete for the male member of the house, your husband.<br>  Positive reinforcement helps a lot.  Plus your husband's participation is very important.  If your husband shows you attention, such as sitting near you, touching you, etc., then he and you should also give reassurance and attention to your dog together, to show that your are a family and there's no need to compete for it.<br>  I hope this makes sense.  It won't work unless your husband works with you to change your dog's behavior.<br>  Be patient.  It will work.  I've been through it many times.<br>  Best of luck.  Hope I helped.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Well, nobody growls at me, but otherwise it's the same here. They love to be on my husbands lap. You might try to put the dog in submissive posture during the day when the husband is gone. On her back with belly and neck exposed. She needs to see you as dominant to her. She is jealous and challenging you for 2nd position in the pack.|`|3p3otDlXaa	Oh, nothing.  Train her at the most.|`|zWFJBlJZaa	This is a dominance problem!!!  Although you are the one who spends the time with her and feeds her, and takes care of her -- she sees your husband as the boss and your dog believes SHE is second in command and YOU are at the bottom of the pack.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that YOU take her through Obedience Classes so that she will learn to obey you and your rank will rise in the pack!!!<br>  <br>  PS  Your husband would do well to reprimand her when she acts in this manner towards you.|`|bO9vJY2Caa	that sounds like a spoiled dog to me <br>  so what i would do is get a specialist to train her to get some education|`|fTMQOmhsaa	I kind of have the same problem (but my dog doesn't growl at me).  I have decided a couple things about this situation.  1) She might seem him as the ultimate pack leader and you are his second in command.  Therefore when he is around he gets all the attention.  2) My dog doesn't hate me.  3) Take her for more walks and see what happens.  I find when I spend more time exercising my dog she likes me more than she likes him.  4) Keep in mind it isn't a contest to see who she loves more!  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UW9Trvrpaa	Your dog does not hate you. It might be jealous. Maybe your dog notices that you and her are different in ways and she notices that you and your husband are similar. It might think of him as something that comes between you two.<br>  Try to let your dog spend some time with your husband. Be firm with your dog.<br>  Also, has your husband done something that your dog might dislike? Such as bothering it. I am not trying to offend you or your husband. I am just trying to say that if your husband has picked up your dog or made it uncomfortable in anyway.<br>  But I think it might just be jealous of you and your husband being together. Talk to it when your husband is around and try to comfort it.

You could get more if you gelded him.
01nMRPHVaa	How Much to Feed <br>  This will depend a bit on your individual turtle. A good rule of thumb is to feed as much as your turtle will consume in 15 minutes. If you feed in a separate container, it is easier to monitor how much and how fast your turtle eats. It is important to offer a variety of foods at the same time -- don't just give your turtle its favorite items. <br>  <br>  As an alternative guideline, another common "rule of thumb" is to give meals that are roughly the same size (in total volume) as the turtle's head and neck. Still, you'll need to monitor your turtle's body condition and adjust if necessary. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind, that if you are feeding strictly by these rules, feeding every day might be too much, and every two or three days might be too little. You will likely need to adjust the amount you give your turtle. <br>  <br>  The best guide is to monitor your turtle's weight and condition, and with a little experience you will get to know better how much your turtle can eat and stay in good condition. You also do not want to let juvenile turtles grow too quickly. <br>  <br>  I suggest not feeding them turkey as a main source of there food.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	The only turtles that eat cooked food prefer pizza and live in a sewer.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about shell length, feed them whatever they will consume in one "sitting", then hold off until the next feeding, which could be a week later. An alternative is to go to the bait shop for a pint of minnows and let the turtles feed themselves.
IrdZKYT3aa	He sounds like he has a wound on his mouth, but is most likelly outh rot, and fin rot.  Meds are needed to help these.  Increase his temp to around 82-84, they'll effectually induce a fever, helping him fight off the bad bacteria.  Add a Little aquarium salt as well, I always make sure to keep some on hand as it can do wonders for most disease these little guys can get.  It'll help increase his slime coat, relieve stress and help make the water less hospitable for bacteria, parasites and fungus.<br>  <br>  Finrot:<br>  Finrot is caused by Aeromonas and Pseudomonas species of bacteria found in all aquariums. The fin and ray tissue becomes opaque, blood streaked and eaten away. It is important to catch this erosion before it reaches the fin base, as this leads to the fish's death. Susceptibility to this disease is commonly caused by poor water conditions or damage resulting from fin-nipping fish. It is therefore necessary to deal with the cause of the problem to prevent a recurrence.<br>  <br>  Finrot Treatment:<br>  Treatments (such as Interpet's Anti Fungus and Bacteria No.8) destroys the bacteria, halting fin erosion. It may take some time for the fin to grow back. The medicine remains active for several days thus preventing a rapid recurrence of this disease.<br>  <br>  Mouthrot / Mouth Fungus:<br>  This is caused by a bacterium, Flexibacter Columnaris. The symptoms of this disease are typically erosion of the mouth, commonly associated with a fungal like growth, which is in fact colonies of the column-like bacteria. Like finrot, mouthrot is associated with poor water conditions which must be corrected.<br>  <br>  Treatment for Mouthrot / Mouth Fungus:<br>  Treatments (such as Interpet's Anti Fungus and Bacteria No.8) destroys the bacteria, halting mouth erosion although it may take some time for regeneration. The medicine remains active for several days thus preventing an immediate recurrence.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|ROmhHYAMaa	One cause is fin rot or your betta is generally getting older which is natural. Treat him for fin rot just incase if nessesary. Give him good live foods will generally help with this cause, give him some bloodworms, they love it! <br>  Perhaps try breeding him to get him sexual active and for him to stop eating his own fins!<br>  <br>  Well Good luck<br>  From David =)|`|1YNhKzeqaa	Its hard to say without seeing the fish... the fin deterioration may be due to fin rot though, and discoloration can be a fungus.<br>  <br>  Honestly I really can't tell you for sure what it is, but what I can tell you is use aquarium salt in the water to prevent future disease. There is a special kind of salt for fresh water fish. It helps to keep your fish healthy, it really helps ALLOT. Be sure its aquarium salt though, and not marine salt.<br>  <br>  Another note: When you do start him on treatment, don't use and all-around medicine, instead it is best to use a medicine specific to your fish's disease.|`|ugi4aUZXaa	it could be fin rot with the fins and the discoloration around the mouth is probably just mouth fungus i would buy some melafix it fixes fin rot and mouth fungus just make sure u use it like it says no more no less and it should clear it up in a few days otherwise ive been having a problem with fin rot in one of my tanks and it could probably do a whole lot of damage just in a few days to a week its fast.|`|tdJ1wE7daa	If he is old it may be an old age thing for the discoloration. And he may be bored and eating his own fins. Mine does it all the time. They will grow back. There is a possibility it is fin rot. I don't know though, I have never had a betta with it before.
bI7wMCJXaa	At 14 no one is going to take you seriously as a dog trainer and pay you to help with their dogs. Even if they did hiring you could violate child labor laws in virginia which usually affect people under the age of at least 15.<br>  <br>  And I'm sure you've seen the disclaimer on Dog Whisperer that says "consult a professional before trying these techniques yourself".<br>  <br>  If you are paid for services you are a business which means you have to file special paperwork at tax time. Even though you are only 14 you have to claim income, again, there are issues with child labor laws.<br>  <br>  What do you plan on doing if one of the dogs you are training bites someone? As the dog's handler you are responsible for that.<br>  <br>  If you want to work with dogs go to your local animal shelter. Most have a behaviorist on staff, let her know you want to learn more about training dogs. Go through a couple obedience classes with shelter dogs and apply your knowledge where you can. If you still love training dogs go to school and learn how to be a good dog trainer and find out how to be an AKC recognized trainer.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I would think that you'd actually have to go thru a program of some kind to legally call yourself a professional dog trainer to get paid for it.<br>  <br>  You can train your own dogs..  but you cant really call yourself a professional to run a buisiness and get paid for it until you've been thru some kind of program.<br>  <br>  At your age.. you can walk dogs, pet-sit and pick up poop to earn money tho.

sfuIoLjvaa	If the dogs owners don′t pay up an muzzle them then kill the dogs.<br>  <br>  My friends cat just died after being mauled by a dog.

Which dog did it is unknown or it′s life would be mine.|`|XIVmi5t6aa	If the cat was on your property or if the dogs were off leash running around the neighborhood not controlled you could definitely take them to court and have them pay or at least help pay the veterinary bill.<br>  If you don't want to do that you can make payments.<br>  We did that when my cat got it's jaw ripped up by a possum.|`|B80oFG3xaa	You could take then to small claims court but I would recommend you call the police ASAP.

IJoM4Q50aa	I got to go to one several years ago. I thought it was great. I ride western, but can appreciate any discipline. I really enjoyed seeing them and am very glad I went.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	Yes, many times.  The Lipi's are at their home barn in my town during Jan/Feb/March every year.  They are amazing creatures and their movements and personalities are awe inspiring to watch.  The horses have wonderful lives.   They are healthy and clean and live in a wonderful environment while they are here.  You are able to visit them in their barn and speak to their grooms and riders who are very friendly and anxious to talk to you about these wonderful horses.  We even have the opportunity to take lessons on the horses while they are here.  I have not attempted it but think it would be beyond wonderful.  They are so strong and powerful in their movements.  Congratulations on your opportunity.  You should have a wonderful time if you love horses.  Last year, we even got to see a new baby - too cute.|`|ge7QGN9Zaa	I've been a few times. They used to do a show here every year.<br>  <br>  I loved it. Watching the horses move and how they respond to their riders is incredible. Listening to the history and the explanations of what moves to look for only adds to it.|`|x787hJbBaa	Yeah I went to one a couple years ago with my dad and my best friend. It was pretty cool. I am more jumping oriented, but I loved watching them anyway. Some of the shows also bring spanish horses too like Andalusians.|`|0d22uiaaaa	I have been to two small shows and to a large show in California. The horses are amazing.

rXMTdUg4aa	1.) They will both give you an equal challenge. It all comes down to getting them fixed. Female dogs don't have a tendancy to mark territory in your home but males of a certain age that are not neutered will. If you get your male neutered at 4 months you shouldn't have a problem with this. PLUS neutering and spaying your pets not only lengthens their lives by 3 years it is a gesture of love and it shows you care about not adding to our already crowded pet population.<br>  <br>  2.) Females tend to be a little calmer. This has to do a lot with socializing them as well... with both sexes. If they get comfortable about going to the vet, other animals, people, children, etc. they will be less anxious and excitable when taken into public or introduced into a new situation.<br>  <br>  3.)Gender and aggression... again. Its all about spaying and neutering. Also, I have seen females not get along well with other females... and vice versa with males on males. It seems that a female dog and male get along better. But this is my observation and some do agree.<br>  <br>  4.) Again... spay and neuter. Neutering is easier and a little cheaper than a spay because its less invasive. Other than that... they have the same shots and eat the same food.<br>  <br>  5.) This is question #2 asked differently.<br>  <br>  I hope I have been helpful and good luck with your new dog. I hope when selecting your dog you will contact a shih-tzu rescue in your area instead of buying from a breeder. They do have puppies as well... if that is what you are looking for:)|`|0ee4bfdaab9564dc9d539b29997544ecaa	I'd go with a female. They are easier to train and would probably calmer. I have a female and she is the best!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	It really all comes down to preference.  As long as the dog is spayed/neutered, there shouldn't be any major problems as far as aggression and hyperactivity.  Also, every dog is different.  You'll have to meet the dog first to assess how calm or how easy-going they are.  Getting one gender or the other won't guarantee how they'll act as they get older.  You have to assess them as pups and train, train, train.  One gender, typically speaking, is not easier to train than the other.|`|P2tdPoH7aa	You should get a female, but PLEASE adopt!!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy9LiWEWd9I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy9LiWEWd...</a><br>  <br>  A gender really doesn't effect the type of dog, just the way you raise it. Dogs that are bought from pet stores are much more aggressive and harder to train from what is told. Some dogs bought from pet stores are very sick. My dog came from a pet store, shes only 3 and growing tumors on her back, she throws up all the time...animals from pet stores come from puppy mills.<br>  <br>  Dogs that are adopted are much more lovable and thankful for their care and owners. Trust me on that one. ;)<br>  <br>  Adopt at your local shelter!|`|CvoyIESkaa	I have a female and a male. Both trained about the same. The female is more wild and active than the male. Although, both are very active. They both do bite, but it's a gentle bite they won't hurt you. They really love to play. I think the female is the better dog personally.|`|nl5JOu43aa	I have a male and female Yorkies,the male acts like a 10 year old boy,always into something,and the female is like a dainty little girl.Thru out the years of having both genders,the females have always been easier to train.|`|bLHrdXsiaa	All of the issues you're looking for are going to differ with each dog individually, not by their genders. Some males will be hyper, some will be calm, some females will be hyper, some will be calm. When you're looking around, try the rescue centers and ask the people there how the dog(s) react to them (i.e. do they have a lot of energy normally, or are they calm, etc.) since the dogs may be more used to them by the time you get there than they are to you. <br>  <br>  I myself would get a female just because, in my experience, they're less likely to pee ON things. My male dogs like to pee on furniture whereas my females usually go on the pee mats. But whatever you do, make sure to get your dog spayed/neutered if it isn't already.
LURQBU86aa	Yes it is a very good high quality food. I've used it with my cat and she loved it, and it's available at both Petco and Petsmart which is convenient. If you go to their website they and take a little survey they'll actually send you a coupon for it as well.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Blue Buffalo is a good food.  Other high quality foods are Wellness, Natural Balance, Avoderm, Innova, Chicken Soup.  I would feed a mix of both dry and canned for best health.<br>  <br>  All dry is NOT the best way to feed - and it doesn't keep the teeth clean like many people and vets claim.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Blue Buffalo is significantly better than Iams - and with Iams you're paying for all that clever advertising that has caused you (and tons of others) to not read what's actually *in* the bag.  Yes, Iams is full of cheap fillers like corn and by-products (that's the scrap "parts" that have been deemed unfit for human consumption).  Blue Buffalo doesn't contain any corn, and no by-products.  You are getting real meat for your money, and your cat will be much better off.  I get their canned occasionally when I got to Petco or Petsmart.  Very little dry is fed at my house, and while they liked the Blue, they didn't like those little blue 'life source" nuggets that they put in, and I got tired of them being all over my kitchen floor, LOL!  A premium quality food will give you very good results.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I feed Blue Buffalo in a rotation with Wellness.  It is a very good food.  I'm on the wet food wagon too.  Dry food is the culprit in most cases of feline diabetes, obesity, and kidney failure due to it's carb content and anti-moisture formulation.  Cats are genetically engineered NOT to consume the amount of water they need to maintain proper organ function and dry food actually detracts moisture from their systems.  here is a good article on why feeding wet is better.  If you read the labels, you'll find Iams, Science Diet, Royal Canin, and Eukanuba are basically the same as the cheaper brands.

Not one of the best, but it's good. <br>  <br>  Here's some even higher quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|ARfxEH0qaa	yes ! its a good cat food but also it is very expensive than other brands of same quality and quantity.<br>  <br>  I am using this brand of cat food for last 1 yrs. -----> <a href="http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c381_Cat-Food.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c3...</a><br>  <br>  This food is completely equivalent to Blue Buffalo brand and also this is a cheap product.|`|0iD1W5jlaa	well, i never heard of that food before.

Elkhounds love people and all other animals. In Norway they hunt elks but don't attack. They keep them amused until the hunter arrives.

Most Australian Elkhounds live in South australia and the rest of our dogs' litters went there so we were unable to breed from them.<br>  Elke is now 11 years old and although she has arthritis and is slowing down we love her madly, along with everyone in our region as she is quite a celebrity.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  ConCATulations on your newest addtion to your fur family!<br>  <br>  Cats are so individualistic about their eating habits. Some gobble the whole portion in a heartbeat. Some cats that are free-fed prefer to "graze", to return later for another "snack". <br>  <br>  The only way you will know, of course, if she still has worms is to take her stool sample to your vet for a test. Of course this means separating her in a room with a litter box so you know it is hers.<br>  <br>  While the shelter told you that she came off a van that adopts animals out, you really don't know much about her early life, but if her ear was clipped off, it is possible that she was a stray kitten, foraging for a living, and is food anxious. It is also possible that she has a very hardy appetite so you will definitely need to be careful about her weight to prevent having a "pudgy" cat as she ages. You don't say what brand of moist food you are feeding... some brands have more nutritional value than others. We feed Wellness to Hush Puppy, and Natural Balance Venison/duck and peas (For Hubble- who has IBD and food allergies)<br>  <br>  My 9 year-old Oriental Shorthair, Hubble, is a vacuum cleaner when it comes to food.  He weighs 10 pounds which I carefully maintain, but he could become a porky pussycat if I didn't monitor his intake, and separate him from his brother when I feed. He finishes his portion in an eyeblink and would devour anything that his brother, Hush Puppy, would leave. Hush Puppy is a slow and methodical eater and takes much longer to finish his meal.  So please don't let Jazzy feast on leftovers.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you separate them when you are feeding- at least separate Jazzy, and pick up any leftovers from the others, to feed them later. If Hush Puppy has left overs, I put it in a plastic container, refrigerate it and warm it and add it to his next meal. The only left overs that Hubble leaves is the dish itself.. and I bet he would try to consume that <grin><br>  <br>  So take a stool sample to your vet to be sure she is worm free, but I suspect it is her background with food that is at the root of this behavior, and don't forget she is still a young cat who is growing.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck to you and Jazzy.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association|`|ArBOK95aaa	could she still have worms.  yes.<br>  <br>  Does she?  not necessarily.  Growing cats need a LOT of food.  They are growing by leaps and bounds, and then there is all that leeping and bounding they do for fun.  it is not unusual for kittens to out eat adults.  I'm often amused at how much young kittens can eat.|`|gYLkvAnjaa	It's always possible that your cat has worms-that's why vets will deworm your pet at every yearly check-up.  However, just because she's being aggressive with her food doesn't necessarily mean she has worms.  You mentioned that she may have been a stray.  I have a cat that was previously a stray, and she's definatley the biggest eater in the bunch.  I think it goes back to the mentality of eating all you can whenever you can because you don't know when you'll get your next meal.  I would suggest feeding your cats seperately.  That way, each cat gets to eat their own food without someone else finishing it for them.  Also, you said that you were giving then canned food.  Do you have dry food for them as well?  Not only does this help keep their teeth clean and prevent them rotting in the future, but cats like to munch on their food several times during the day, and like water, it should be readily available at all times.  This may also prevent the more food aggressive cat from stealing the other cat's food.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	She may do, have you treated her for fleas?(not being offensive)as they cause the worms in the first place! so then she would be being wormed for nothing,or she may have sicked it up without you knowing as some cats do through being allergic,so if in doubt check with the vet, as there is now a treatment for worms by injection, that's what i do with mine,as they were like yours eating a lot, but have been fine since the injections.another reason for a big appetite is pregnancy,but you dont say if she is spayed.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Unlikely it's worms if she was just treated recently with vet meds.  The only way to know for sure is to take in a stool sample.  Could be she's just a big eater. If she was a stray it could be that she grew accustomed to not having food readily available and is used to eating all she can find. Try feeding her separately for a while till she learns there will always be a next meal.
z2b8Y3E9aa	Just like a teenager, sometimes it just happens.  At that age, he does not differentiate between sexual excitement and regular yay daddy is home excitement.  I try not to pay attention to it unless he's humping you.  If humping becomes a problem or it just plain weirds you out, consider neutering in a couple months.  (im pretty sure they need to be 6 months old for that).  I guess to answer your question, yes its normal, its happening cause he's excited.  Some dogs grow out of it.|`|tdJ1wE7daa	If it only happens when the dog is excited it is normal.|`|Z9xy3Mwxaa	my puppy does the same thing hes just excited and its new smells|`|5jfEQAlwaa	LOL... Yes very normal. All is good.|`|088k8bRYaa	Thats perfectly normal that means he excited so dont worry my dog did that ALL the time
AQsiugSpaa	Hi there Pretty Kitty,<br>  <br>  I checked out the link and if it were my cat, I would probably keep him on Wellness if he is doing ok. But I did find an interesting group for you to check out. The way I found it was through googling "Natural Balance Cat food good for cats with CRF?", so I assume it is one of the brands they are discussing. You have to join the group however.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CatNutrition/summary">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CatNutriti...</a><br>  <br>  Here is the link to other groups and information<br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/phrase/natural-balance-cat-food">http://groups.yahoo.com/phrase/natural-b...</a><br>  <br>  The way I learned about NB cat food was when one of my cats was diagnosed with food allergies and IBD. The first food that my vet suggested was Royal Canin Duck and Peas and Venison and Peas, but the cost was very, very high ( $48.00 for 24 5.5 oz cans" and my cat didn't like it either. So I joined the IBD group and learned about Natural Balance Duck and Peas and Venison and Peas, and the cost for those products in 6 oz cans, is about 22.00. It is a high quality food/ grainless also and is good nutrition. I had a problem with one of the cans ( found a bone chip -Yikes) and the manufacturer sent me a carton to replace the can. They were very responsive to my problem.<br>  <br>  So you might want to check it out. There is no liver, fish or any by products in the ingredients, either. He also is in the beginning stages of renal failure- a 9 year old Oriental Shorthair neuter, and my vet is very happy with his diet.<br>  <br>  My other cat ( no physical problems) also a 9 year old Oriental neuter, likes to steal a bite fom his brother's portion, and loves it. But I am keeping him on Wellness as he really digests the kitten formula very well, and occasionally vomits with other Wellness products.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your quest and hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Doesn't look grain-free to me! I see brewers rice in there. Brewers rice is a low quality grain product. I see wheat gluten in one too.<br>  <br>  A few other points I'm not pleased with:<br>  <br>  - Ocean fish. This basically means they could be putting /any/ type of ocean fish in. They don't specify what type. <br>  <br>  - Animal liver. Again, we aren't clear on what animal this liver is coming from.<br>  <br>  Not a flat out /terrible/ food, but not something I'd feed or recommend either.<br>  <br>  Darksong~|`|qI12jcVpaa	My cat is a big fatso and we bought the weight control one, and it really works for him plus he loves it!

Meat by-products are okay, they actually have a lot of nutrition in them, so I've heard.  I don't like the yeast though, I read somewhere to stay away from that.  I have to find a food that helps my one cat with a digestive disorder.  They look so awesome on Evo No Grain, but I switched back to Innova, which I felt comfortable with but Leopold still has extremely loose stools.  I am feeding him Science Diet (cring) and have seen more cohesion in the stools.  It the price is right on Authority, I think it's okay to feed it since it has no corn or wheat.  That's my big beef.  The Omegas are  a plus.|`|srjPOxW7aa	I've been feeding my cats this ever since it first came out. I have 5 permanent cats and fosters always coming and going. All the cats love it!|`|AA11584265	I've honestly never heard of this brand. Where would you find it? I usually buy my cats the Sophistacat brand cat food from PetsMart. Its a little cheaper in price but comparable to Purina. My cats seem to like it and they aren't too picky about much (thank god) but I don't like to change up their food a whole lot (I've heard that creates a finicky eater) so I am pleased that they like this brand. I will have to look into Authority and see if the PetsMart carries it. I am curious now.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	While I wouldn't put it in the same class as Wellness, it's a very good food for the price.  I was buying their chunks and gravy for my one kidney-compromised cat (not the best, but he gets canned only and is very picky) until the pet food recall with the contaminated wheat gluten - I'm ashamed to admit I didn't even know what wheat gluten was prior to that.  And before I discovered EVO, I fed cases of their canned kitten food to hungry hoards of kittens.  I like to recommend it to people who're thinking about making the jump from supermarket junk foods, as the price is right and it's easy to go to Petsmart and get it.  <br>  <br>  If I'm in Petsmart (rarely) I pick up a couple cans of it along with Blue Buffalo just as a change of pace - Wellness (canned) is the staple here, along with Merrick and Natural Balance canned.  Since I buy by the case I get it mailorder, so I just stick to what they like and what our local mom-and-pop pet store stocks.
UETAqR8Taa	You dont say how long you have had her for? If for a short time, then time alone would improve things.<br>  <br>  If she has been with you for more than say 3 months, then it does seem she is depressed.<br>  <br>  She definately suffers seperation anxiety.<br>  Some helpful tips for seperation anxiety are - <br>  1) make your arrivals and departures very low key not a big deal of hugging and kissing and goodbyes be up beat.<br>  2) Playtime and cuddles is on your terms not when she constantly demands it.<br>  3) Get her used to the leaving cues like picking up keys, your handbag etc. But do it during the time your home and you actually dont leave. Do it a lot. to help her fears of you leaving<br>  4) lots of exercise makes her more tired and more likely to sleep more during the day. Try and give her heaps of tiring out runs.<br>  5) Give her things to do while your gone. A good idea is to hide treats around the house. It will keep her occupied finding them. An eating dog is not a stressed dog<br>  6) Dont draw attention to the objects she is chewing/destroying before you leave, it could cause her to pay more attention to them<br>  7) Consider crating her for the day<br>  8) Consider doggie daycare<br>  9) Give her plenty of chew toys and balls to help occupy.<br>  <br>  Hope this is some help for you and your dog|`|Wt61EclRaa	Has she been checked over by the vet?  She could be in pain.  Labs have a high tolerance for pain...signs of pain are panting,shaking,being depressed.  Maybe she has arthritis and needs some meds.  Take her to the vet to rule out any of these things.  If all is fine then she needs to adjust just like any new dog.  Take her for a lot of walks through out the day. The vet could also prescribe something to help calm her.  Talk to your vet.  This is so important.  They are there to help you.|`|pcUAErpQaa	Socialize, ha I found my dog on the street. She looks depressed also. What makes me happy is when she wags her tail. Open to her make her feel like she has a perfect owner and home. Why dont you let her sit on your lap?<br>  <br>        Oh poor dog, how dare that first owner be very cruel to her!|`|XLnboFslaa	I think maybe it has something to do with her previous owners or it's because she's getting old. Try petting her more and being more nice to her.|`|tdJ1wE7daa	Maybe there is some sort of doggy day care she can go to while you are not home to keep her occupied?|`|UW9Trvrpaa	Your dog might just be worried that you might leave her. Try to comfort her and do not hug her and say goodbye to her multiple times before you leave the house. A goodbye and a short hug would suffice. If start to hug her a lot and say goodbye to much times before you leave, she might think you're going to leave for a long time.<br>  Please do not be violent to your dog but also do not spoil her. And please do not give the dog to someone else again. It seems like she has been through a lot and might not be able to cope with another owner.<br>  Do you have a friend or somewhere she can go where she has company for the time being that you are gone? But do not force her to be with anyone. For the first time if you do have a friend that can take care of her. Stay with your dog and your fiend for the first few times. Let your dog get used to the person. Then leave for a short time. Around 10 min.? Then take your dog and go home. The next time leave her there for 30 min.? And increase the time bit by bit.<br>  But do not force your dog to stay with anyone who it is uncomfortable with.<br>  Hope this helps!
vIYGV1C7aa	Your family and the posters above me are all correct.  You need to find a professional to help work with your dogs issues, especially one that specializes in the area of aggression.<br>  <br>  Your shyness and timidness of introducing your dog to new people are only adding to the dogs sense of protecting you.  While training with your dog, this should give you some confidence and help the situation, but it sounds like you need to find more confidence in yourself in whole.  Take this opportunity to try and find your strengths and grow from that.  With confidence, you will become not just a better leader for your dog, but a better person for yourself.|`|WIFKeDBgaa	Inside is not him feeling "territorial"...more like he's feeling "cornered".

Also contact the local ACOs for your neighboring towns.<br>  <br>  I hope she has tags, otherwise you may never see her again.|`|pGOv3sFfaa	Oh my gosh, I hope you find her.. I really do. All the best.<3<br>  Anyway, I agree with the people above, hand out fliers or post them<br>  around the neighborhood.|`|tnTxHVO5aa	Lost posters around the neighborhood|`|wjwsFPMuaa	If she has her collar with identification on..then that will help out a lot if she is found. <br>  <br>  If you get her back...have her microchipped if she isn't already.<br>  <br>  Put out posters with her picture on there and basic information. Her age, name, size, and contact information.<br>  <br>  Also call the law enforcement again on Monday. When my aunt lost her Jack Russell a couple weeks ago (he bolted out the door) the local police said they hadn't picked him up when she reported him lost. Yet the next day they HAD...(they didn't notify her) and they ended up taking him to the Humane Society an hour away! We still think there's something fishy going on with that scenario being she reported him missing and they claimed they hadn't found him. <br>  <br>  She had to go through hell to get him back. If him bolting out the door wasn't enough...he was due that WEEK to have his rabies shots updated, AND his collar had broken a day beforehand. So Dozer got out...rabies vaccine expired, no collar...it was chaos. The Humane Society made getting him back extremely difficult for my aunt also.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Call any vet clinics / emergency clinics in the area, see if she's been brought in, leave a message on their machine if they're closed.<br>  <br>  You can post also on Dog Detective & Fido Finder:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogdetective.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogdetective.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fidofinder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fidofinder.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you get her home safe & sound.|`|JaFbuUUWaa	Call the local vet and emergency clinic, in case (but hopefully not) she got hit by a car or injured some other way and brought in by a friendly stranger, if the dog is microchipped inform the microchip company.|`|WT56iKwZaa	Put up posters and offer a reward<br>  Place food outside the door<br>  Put an object of the owners outside also. <br>  <br>  I recently lost my dog too and cant think of anything I did that you havent already done|`|o2NZBZO0aa	Sounds like you've done everything you can.

I pray you find her safe.|`|X1tawExBaa	what youve done now is more than enough. you must really love ur dog|`|0xBvybIxaa	great job for the concern you are doing well. hope you find her...<br>  and the most original thing to do. post flyers everywhere. paper flyers in your naighborhood and other places. makrkets, stores, etc. and place her food and something she will remember outside. my aunt lost her dog at a boating trip once they stayed there all night looking spent the night in the car and left her bed, food and water, and toys outside. when they got up she was there with their stuff...if you dog is a kinda scared dog she will lok for comforting things(things she remembers)<br>  good luck|`|FdcWPp48aa	Call all the vets in the local area and have them take a note down. Also, when the shelters open, go there and walk each of their cages out. I have heard too many times when people only called and were told their dog was not in the shelter, they went and found it there. So go and walk them yourselves, and get help to check the other shelters every day. I so hope you find her!!!!<br>  <br>  Oh, if there is a Weimeraner rescue in your area, you may want to contact them, as if she is found and the person doesn't want to take her to the pound, may contact Weim Rescue....|`|UW9Trvrpaa	Try to check her favorite places to go. Also, hand out fliers of the lost dog and put them around the neighborhood. Other than that, you seem to have everything covered. Remember to put a photo of her, the address, and phone number.Good luck in finding her!|`|jbJA6m60aa	Keep looking think positive and put up LOTS and LOTS of posters tell everyone and tell them to tell there friends! news will get around. <br>  I hope you find your dog!<br>  Sarah~~|`|vJALfvnWaa	Oh I'm so sorry I hope you can find her . Is there a special area she could be in?|`|fTMQOmhsaa	sounds like you got it covered!  Good luck finding her!  Was she wearing a color with tags?  Is she microchiped?
UuvqZk7Xaa	Your cat is just doing what she did as a nursing kitten.  When she was nursing she "massaged" her mother's tummy to stimulate the flow of milk, and her mother licked her to clean her at the same time. So she salivated to help swallow and digest the milk, and she felt contented and happy.  Some cats never grow out of that of the association between "happy" and "food and licking", and will always dribble when they feel content, especially when you are patting them and they are giving you the "massage".|`|0uqsaxEqaa	I've got one that does this too. He's been blind since birth and I think his mouth is slightly deformed, which might have something to do with it... he's 15 so it hasn't really had any major effect.<br>  <br>  However... most cats salivate/or their nose runs/or something when they purr. I don't know exactly which it is, but on the whole they just swallow it. You'll often see a purring cat stop for a second, swallow, then go on purring. Obviously some individuals just don't get the knack!|`|srjPOxW7aa	I have two cats that do that, and it's stinky too. Manda has some good advice there. Also they have at pet store grass  patches that grown in just a matter of days of watering, that's really helpful for their breath and teeth :)|`|AacmVYD9aa	1. could be that he has bad teeth. they tend to drool from that.<br>  2. he could just be very excited or content. <br>  <br>  i would try cleaning his teeth if that does not help or if he does not have teeth problems... he likes you. lol hope that helps|`|oTHdb4HKaa	lmao sorry|`|AJxl0IvHaa	my two calicos do it.....<br>  They just get excited.<br>  Nothing to worry about.<br>  I changed ones name to jeruler. Because she jeruled every where.|`|OehjuDxVaa	No<br>  <br>  Mine does that too<br>  <br>  Its kind of gross but its nothing bad|`|yLiOgVEYaa	it's actually normal in a lot of cats. as long as she's done it all her life. now if she just recently started the drooling it could be signs of problems with their teeth or gums. but i've seen some cats that do the same thing. it's cute.|`|qI12jcVpaa	This is normal for cats. There is no medical problem, but I would advise to see your local vet just in case.|`|z6IekuwSaa	Mine does that too! And it's even worse when she shakes her head and sprays it all over me|`|QbJ04Zqiaa	I've had cats that do that. Nothing to worry about- it just means they're extra-super happy!
50azgKE8aa	Your dog is not seeing spirits/ghosts.  Some dogs do that with different things.  It may trigger a memory that scares him or something.  What you really need to do is stop that insecurity of his.  He needs to overcome that fear.  Every time you see him doing that you need to tell him no, tap him on he nose,  and open to door and stick your hand in the cupboaord or something to shw him theres nothing there.  To him youre his 'parent'/alpha dog so if you are brave and show him theres nothing to be afraid of then he should eventually stop.  But itsvery important that you dont love/comfort him when he does that.  It will only reinforce the behavior and make him think its ok.  Which its not.  I hope that helps!  Just be patient with him it may take a while!|`|6d6a92cfa24029ef82993ae689105908aa	Ignore the behavior. If you are going to him and trying to comfort him then you are rewarding that behavior and he will continue to act that way. If you pay him no attention after awhile he will learn that he no longer gets the attention he wants so he will stop. Dogs know just how to manipulate you to get what they want(your attention)  Congrats to your dog he is a good trainer.|`|Os6VjLH0aa	He could be hearing a mouse or possibly your pipes are making a noise that they haven't made before.<br>  I wouldn't worry about it, just call it the ghost under the sink!<br>  Dogs have hearing that is way better than ours, he's hearing something you can't hear.|`|pyd8zVKNaa	are there any noises coming from the sink? it could be something he hears but you can't.|`|SaAQZiG4aa	don't think he sees spirits a mouse or something that bothers him can be there my dog does this whenever he sees a trash bag|`|AoSeHXeQaa	maybe you have mice.|`|3kpZrtmdaa	Animals Sense Spirits And Ghosts Very Easily<br>  But Something Must Of Happened There Or Else Your Dog Would Not Be Doing That, Perhaps Someone Died Got Murdered In That One Spot And Its Soel / Spirit Is Still There And Hasn't Moved On<br>  <br>  Maybe Do Some Research On Your House.|`|M2hnhyfUaa	umm.. its a dog dogs are afraid of certian things somtimes.<br>  <br>  heres an example: lets say im afraif of heights and your not, i backdown and don't go on the whatever it is thats high.|`|Wbf6SMQnaa	mice or bugs or maybe you never know the dogs eyesight could be going bad so its "seeing things"
2l7lbcJWaa	OK wow I just read 13 "answers" that didn't even answer the question. <br>  <br>  1. If the mother of the puppy is still available, leave the pup with the mom for a few more weeks. If not, and you know you can take on the responsibility, then TAKE IT! Good grief you got a lot of lectures out of this question!<br>   <br>  2. I would mix puppy milk replacement with a good quality puppy food.<br>  I feed my puppy Taste of The Wild..I buy it from a local feed store. Remember to feed him 3 times a day. My vet said it's not good to let a puppy eat whenever he pleases. Just make a schedule and feed morning, noon and evening. <br>  <br>  3. The first key to any kind of potty training is watching your puppy like a hawk! It's better to PREVENT mistakes before they happen. Most likely your tiny puppy is going to sleep a lot, so, as soon as he wakes up take him to the puppy pad. Right after he eats, drinks, plays, or just starts sniffing around, take him to the pad. If I were you I would just set a timer to go off every 20 minutes and take him to the pad every time it goes off, this might help with preventing mistakes before they happen.|`|7X0zAd9kaa	To answer your actual question:  I personally would not house train a puppy with the pads.  In my opinion that teaches the puppy to pee in the house.  Instead I would use crate training.  Crate training is where you confine the puppy to a small area when you are not playing with it, feeding it, etc.  The puppy will not pee in it's own area.  Every hour or less (when a small puppy) carry the puppy outside to use the restroom.  If the puppy goes outside then it can be out of the crate.  If the puppy doesn't go then it should be carried back inside to the crate.  <br>  <br>  Also, the puppy should sleep in the crate and always be placed in the crate after eating and drinking. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|N89HLv92aa	4 weeks is way to young for it to leave its mother. The earliest it should leave is 6 weeks.  Also, to train the pup on the pad, you should watch her all the time. When she starts sniffing or squatting you should immediately place her on the pad. Even if she is in the middle of peeing, you need to pick her up and place her on the pad. That is the only way she will learn. Also if you would like to eventually get her to let you know when she wants to go outside and pee, so that you can get rid of the puppy pads, you should slowly move the pad closer and closer to the door, over a certain amount of time. Then when she gets use to using it by the door, remove to pad altogether and everytime she goes to the door let her out. Eventually she will realize that she is suppose to pee outside. They rather pee outside anyway. Good luck!!!|`|IGfnrfGPaa	Your puppy needs to stay with her mother and siblings until at least 8 weeks old, 10-12 weeks is better. She is most likely still nursing. If you get her this young you will end up with a very underdeveloped puppy. Potty training and training in general will be much more difficult. I would not be getting a puppy from this "Breeder", they have no idea what they are doing and supporting them only supports the needless death of millions of dogs in our shelters.<br>  To answer you Q's : Praise her when she does her business on the pad or outside and scold her when she pees or poops where she is not supposed to. You can only do either if you catch her in the act or it means nothing to her. <br>  If you love her you will wait until she is old enough to leave her mother, if you love dogs you will get your next puppy from a shelter or a reputable breeder.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	just to educate you on what can happen if you take a dog away from its mother/litter too early. just because it is weaned doesnt mean it's ready to leave mother yet. even after a pup is weaned they learn vital life lessons from their mother and litter mates. it will not learn the socialization skills it needs to interact with other dogs and people. it can be shy and fearful. it will not have gotten all the nutrition it needs from mothers milk to be a healthy pet. it will not learn skills like how hard to bite when play biting, meaning you may have problems with it nipping at you, other dogs, and people.<br>  is there are reason you are taking this puppy so early? <br>  tip wise, there are sprays you can get to encourage a dog to urinate in a certain area and you can spray these on the pad. after the dog eats, wakes up, plays or drinks take him to the pad to potty. if you see him sniffing around take him to the pad. when you arent supervising him put him in an area where the pad takes up most of the area, the other area in enclosure should only be large enough for pup to lay down, stand up and turn around. this early, i wouldnt expect much in the way of being able to house train. you probably wont see any progress until a least 8 weeks of age|`|ivhnVbbraa	4 weeks old is to young to leave the mom. It should be 8 weeks before it leaves its mom. I would not mess with training it til then. Really you should wait 4 more weeks before you get it. It can ge very sick if it leaves it's mother to soon!|`|VkFDAQ46aa	you shouldnt take a pup away from its mother before its atleast eight weeks old. have some patience and wait a few more weeks|`|s76aC4G8aa	Good lord please don't accept a 4 week old puppy, you will end up with tons of behavioral issues as this dog grows.  However since you don't have any choice then pick up books on newborn pups care so you know what to do.<br>  <br>  Since a puppy without his shots shouldn't be taken outside until he's at least had his first set at 6 weeks old I suggest puppy pads to start then start housebreaking him outside.  Best thing is to put the pads in a room that has an easy to clean floor, cover the floor with the pads that way no matter where he goes he hits a pad, then see what area he pottys in the most, once you find he goes in one area then start removing the pads until only that one area has them.  They are scented so that it encourages pups to potty on them. Once he's had his first round of shots get the pup on a schedule, they will need to potty about 23 times a day, they potty about 30 minutes after each meal and immediatley after drinking, playing and waking up from naps or sleep.  <br>  <br>  As for food I suggest you wet the kibble and make it soft and mushy for him, as he gets to 6-8 weeks he should be able to eat dry kibble without wetting it.  <br>  <br>  Pick up "puppy replacement milk" to help out and a book on new borns as this little guy is a newborn and honestly should NOT be weaned this early.<br>  <br>  Here are some websites to get you started, pick up as many books from the pet store as you can so you know what you're doing.<br>  <br>  Good luck, you're going to have your hands full but make sure you're fully prepared by reading up on the care so you know what to do.<br>  <br>  Once again good luck to you and your new puppy.<br>  <br>  Late Add:  One poster is correct, pads do train a puppy that pottying in the house is OK, but since he's so young and without necessary shots it's best to start him out on pads then wean slowly off after he's had his shots.  The pads will simply be down to hopefully "catch' any messes while still taking him outside regularly to potty.  If you only use them the first couple of weeks and do not rely on pads as a permanent housebreaking tool then you won't have issues.|`|KuUx34hCaa	WHY are you taking this pup at 4wks old it is way to soon to take it from it's mother & litter mates it NEEDS to be with it's mother & L-mates at least 6wks & much better at 8wks & in a lot of states it's against the law to get pup until a full 8 weeks shame on the breed they hav NO! buss. breeding|`|ePheyIF8aa	4 weeks is way too young to be away from his mother. Please wait until the pup is at least 8 weeks before bringing him home. He learns so much from his mom and siblings during that time.|`|Qd3sjE3raa	4 weeks is wayyy to young! it can damage the pups mentally!! they need to be socialized or they will be very wary of other dogs when they meet them 8 weeks is whenever they are weened|`|AA11992723	don't get the puppy tonight. you will have major problems on your hands because puppies learn important social skills from mom and littermates at this stage, like bite inhibition and identifying social cues.<br>  <br>  Also this breeder is not very good to let you take home this puppy so young. supporting someone like this breeder, will hurt dogs.<br>  <br>  I know this isn't the answer you want to hear, but it is the answer you must hear because dogs are in crisis. They are being euthanized in shelters by the millions each year because of overpopulation and owners not wanting their dog anymore. Genetic illness is on the rise because of bad breeding. puppymills keep popping up more and more.(puppymills are "breeding factories" of genetic and acutely sick dogs and abused dogs) we have to stop buying from people like this so that puppymills and bad breeders will be put out of business, to stop their dog abuse.<br>  <br>  And anyway this gives you a chance to be more prepared! I recommend the book "The Dog Whisperer" by Paul Owens, it is a positive reinforcement training book and basic puppy/dog info. also here's a link to a free online new puppy book: <a href="http://www.dogstardaily.com/files/AFTER%20You%20Get%20Your%20Puppy.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogstardaily.com/files/AFTER%...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  Being weaned off food is a physical issue. Your puppy will have severe behavioral issues from being taken away so young. they need to stay with the mom/litter until 8-12 weeks, please for the puppies sake do not buy this one. Buy from a reputable breeder.<br>  <br>  Which is better, immediate gratification (getting the puppy tonight) and having possibly a genetically sick dog later in life because i doubt this "breeder" did any genetic testing on the parents and a dog who is unstable and won't get along with other dogs, OR to wait a bit longer, and get a lifetime with a healthy dpg from a breeder who is responsible and doesn't let the pups go until they should?<br>  <br>  ADD2:<br>  I still wouldn't take the dog unless i could afford more than average amount of training. she's going to need early socialization puppy classes.<br>  you can buy puppy formula in the pet store, i would mix that in with the kibble. make sure it's a high quality kibble like Innova, Taste of the Wild, Wellness. that can help make up for bad genetics.<br>  <br>  Wait hold up. I read your question history (because i wanted to see if you wrote anything more about the puppys situation) Youre going away to college in the fall...Hon, don't get this puppy...someone else will most likely take him because he is such a young puppy. He should be put in a rescue group(someone who will know how to take care of a 4wk old pup) and rehomed at the right age. Call your vet to recommend a foster please...sorry again i know this is not what you want to hear..it's just what is best for the puppy though.|`|Chxoncy7aa	This puppy should be with it's mother and litter mates.  It is way to young to be away from it's mother.  If you do take it, which I do not agree with, you are not going to be pad training a 4 week old puppy.  They are too young.  This is the most important time of that pups life to be with it's litter and mother.  It will be missing a lot of valuable skills it needs to learn from only it's mother right now.<br>  <br>  Add-If this woman would have lost her house, the responsible thing for her to do whould have been to bring mom and babies to a shelter or rescue group.  Go ahead and get the puppy.  But do not come whining on here when it has health or behavior problems.  This is the reason most people end up dumping their dogs in shelters.  They take dogs too young, and then can not handle what comes along with it.<br>  <br>  And you're leaving for college, that's real smart.  Don't mean to be rude, but this whole situation just makes me sick!|`|Bw18seFqaa	your first step is to leave the pup with its mom for at least 4 more weeks.<br>  <br>  If you get the puppy this young, you will have a dog that is neurotic, fearful or aggressive, that also suffers from severe separation anxiety and OCD behaviors.<br>  <br>  Pups need to stay with mom until at least 8 weeks..  at 4 weeks old, this pup is just now starting to wean, it still needs mom!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	4 weeks is too young to be leaving it's mother, it needs to stay with the litter until it is at least 8 weeks.|`|AA11244754	The lady was probably fibbing in order to get people to take the puppies before her landlord found them because the mother dog wouldn't ever wean a puppy at that young of an age.  If I were you I would do 2 things...1) call animal control and let them know what is going on and secondly call your vet and find out what you will need to care for this puppy if you are actually allowed to keep it at this young age.  You will be doing yourself and the puppy a favor just let them know that you are very interested still getting the puppy when it's at the appropriate age to be in a new home.  This way you will not have the stress of trying to care for a small puppy (which could require you getting up at night to care for him properly) and if the shelter or even your vet has a female that can wet-nurse the little guy then that would work even better because he can learn all of the needed social skills he's going to miss out on at this point.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	they shouldnt be fully weaned until they are at least 6 weeks old. and they need to stay with their mother until they are 8 weeks old. this woman is obviously an uncaring byb. a decent breeder would never let a puppy go to a new home under 8 weeks old.<br>  <br>  if she wasnt allowed the dog and puppies in the house, why didnt she take them to a no kill shelter where they could be looked after properly and then the mother dog and her puppies could find new homes

They are playful and energetic and very affectionate. They tend to like lots of people.<br>  <br>  Mini Lops are a little larger-weighing in at about 6 1/2 lbs. They require a larger cage needless to say. I'm not that familiar with the minis, the few I've met were nice, similar to Holland Lops.<br>  <br>  French lop -These are big boys. About twice the size of minis. I had some that weighed 15 lbs. They are somewhat shyer than the smaller buns,. They are also much more laid back and not as energetic (as adults) than Hollands. They tend to bond more to one person, but that is not a hard fast rule.

ArBOK95aaa	cats like fresh food.  By moving it around, it might release more scent from the dry food?  <br>  <br>  You suspect diabetes?  you should be getting that cat in to a vet to confirm that.  Heck, you could even go to your local drug store and buy a human glucometer and test it yourself (I tested my own cat's blood sugars for years) <br>  <br>  if you want to eliminate this mess, transition your cats over to a wet food.  They won't be spilling it on the floor, it is better for them anyway (see <a href="http://www.catinfo.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org</a> a website run by a vet who studies feline nutrition) and it will help your kitty who you suspect has diabetes (see felinediabetes.com for info on that)|`|IuYekkPVaa	Cats oten dislike eating out of bowls if their whiskers touch the sides as it's an uncomfortable sensation for them.  Have you tried putting the food on a flat plate to see if that makes a difference?<br>  <br>  If the food has large chunks, it's easier for them to bite it into smaller pieces if it's directly under their mouths, and this could be another reason why they take it out of the bowl and eat it off the floor.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if I've read your question correctly, but if the cats are sharing the same food bowl, then they are removing the food simply to make sure that they get a share of it.  ((I've noticed stray cats I feed do this when they want to steal food out of another cat's dish).  Ideally each cat needs their own dish as this helps reduce potential competition between them.|`|ZgGe0bNZaa	my cat does this too i dont know why i check back later to see if anyone knows|`|piRCGr3maa	i think your cats are doing it out of curiosity my cat does it lol|`|ezT7xruoaa	I found that most cats will do this to an extent, but I've never had a cat that does it as much as yours. Our solution was to put something like a mat or a towel underneath the bowels, to keep the mess to a minimum. I think they like it because they have that food they got out to themselves, like they "got" it and now it's theirs, the other cats can't get it anymore. I think cats see the food bowls as communal bowls, and will not sit and eat from one comfortably because the other cat(s) can still steal from the bowl. <br>  If yours are really bad you might have to sit with them for many meals and quickly scoop the food back into the bowl whenever they do it, maybe it will re-train them? Like when you litter train them and you quickly put them/the poop into the tray to make them remember it? I would also make sure they are in a calm area without disruptions when they eat, and maybe you can put the food bowels for different cats into different rooms/corners, so they are more at peace.|`|wnnudNp5aa	It's a cat thing, I think they all do it! I suspect they don't like having their nose in their food, or maybe they don't like their whiskers rubbing the sides of the bowl while they are eating. I don't have a firm solution, but you could try feeding them from a wider, shallower bowl, like maybe a pie plate, and see if that helps. The best suggestion is to just keep cleaning it up, before it overflows the box, and put it back in the feeder. Annoying, I know, but it only takes a minute.<br>  BTW, if you have a cat that you suspect has diabetes, shouldn't you be getting it to the vet? The poor thing could need medication.|`|6MQsUhHLaa	my cats do this too, one of them dose it with the water bowls and the toilet if we leave the lid up. i think theire playing with it like they would prey before eatting it, their isn't anything i've found that stops them so far. though i do have one that dose it to get around the bits he dosn't like, but you said this wasn't the case with yours. i know this wasn't any help to your question, but you're not alone, and at least their not playing in the toilet at your house.|`|1vF30nXIaa	Were your cats every strays? If they were that might be why, the want to put the food where they want to eat it from. <br>  If not then they may just not like eating there food while is in the bowl.<br>  I have no idea how to stop them, but i would just get rid of that cardboard box since it is not helping any, try putting food on an old plate and see if they like that.<br>  <br>  p.s. Never-Never kill a pet.|`|gjrbp1Aoaa	They may just not like the bowl. Some cats don't like to eat out of bowls, especially if their whiskers touch the sides.  It may also be that they pull it all out to make it easier to eat the pieces they want.  <br>  <br>  My cats have wide, shallow bowls and that seems to help.  My girl used to pull out her food like that a lot. I also keep their main bowls in a much larger container (I think it was meant for chips) to catch the food that they spread around.  That seems to contain any food spreading.  They don't really pull it out any more since I switched to the wide, shallow bowls, but sometimes it falls out of their mouths. <br>  <br>  I do feed them on plates sometimes and they seem like that but if it's a matter of them just preferring to mess around with their food it will be tough to get them to change their habits.  sorry.<br>  <br>  edit -- mine will pull out wet food too.  I totally agree that wet food is better, but if you use bowls and the food is wedged in the corner some cats would rather pull it out than mash their face in it. <br>  <br>  I agree about the sharing and ex-stray cat issues.  I have 6 cats, 4 of whom were strays at one point, there is competition. Breakfast and dinner are their favorite foods and they each need their own portion.  Dinner often consists of 7 portions to reduce frustration when someone wants to switch early. I usually don't even bother with bowls and feed them dinner (dry food) on their beds. And then they end up being impatient with each other over their water fountain. heh.<br>  <br>  please get your kitty tested for diabetes. <br>  Some of mine (who are perfectly healthy) just love water. But the more wet food for kitties, the better. :)
ugi4aUZXaa	stunting the growth of a fish by tank size is a myth the only thing it can do is kill them from ammonia in the water and overcrowding them and putting stress on the fish. another cheaper way is to buy an outside kiddy pool and put them in there thats what ive seen done with air pumps and filters in it. if its just temporary.|`|h6wPCmiIaa	i think its ok as long as you change them to a bigger tank or pond
F3FrZ7eAaa	Their pee smells aweful. Their poop, I'm sure it isn't plesant either. I pick it up though, ASAP so it doesn't get worse. My boys cage smells very nice though when it's pee and poop free-- like his aspen wood chips actually. What you need to keep in mind is Ball Pythons go to the bathroom a lot less than Beardies, so it really isn't bad at all.|`|szzoxJRBaa	hahaha if you have the ball python still, and its not full grown, just wait until it gets bigger. i have a 6 1/2 ft long red tail boa, and when she poos, oh man, its bigger and smells worse than my dog's!!! and shes not even full grown!|`|oVUmlKzuaa	A Ball python itself will not stink.  But the poop will smell after all it is digested mouse...  But you can avoid this by simply scooping out the poop every couple of week.  No animal's poop is going to smell pleasant. But a snake's poop wont be that bad unless you leave it there for a long time and it builds up.
Dkb2ZR3Daa	I would really reconsider owing a monkey as a pet..<br>  Monkeys are extremely social animals, usually living in groups from 30-100+ members. They require a lot of care(like a full time job)! Imagine a puppy now times it by 10! Monkeys are not meant to live caged or confined to a home/area, they can go stir crazy making them unpredictable! And monkey bites are serious-always requiring medical treatment. <br>  I know that they are cute-by why not sponsor one or care for one at a sanctuary.|`|qlDV1OZwaa	black market
z2b8Y3E9aa	I think the same is true of any animal including people.  Hormones are a *****, she probably doesn't feel well,  if its her first time, she may be confused.  Don't push her to socialize if she doesn't want to.  I don't own rats, but I would think that pregnancy is pregnancy.  Is she mean to other rats or to you?  I would say that she knows best at this time.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	Maybe you should ask the people in the Rodent section. <br>  <br>  But just to give it a shot, maybe because she's being protective of her unborn babies so the message is obvious when they are born. Or it could be just released hormones a pregnant mother naturally gives off. It's no lie that some women can be like that when pregnant.|`|Wt61EclRaa	Gees have you ever been pregnant?  I have and I could be pretty cranky sometimes.  If she normally isn't mean then it is because she is pregnant and maybe uncomfortable being held.  Leave her alone if she doesn't want to be handled or touched.  Hold your hand out and let her come to you if she wants attention. They are very Intelligent animals.  Give her a break.|`|o2NZBZO0aa	ALL females r when they r pregnant!!!|`|KxjUim7yaa	This is dog***** not rodent*****|`|WLxnvLZyaa	uhh i think you're in the wrong category, lol this is for dogs
ubImTehVaa	mines got ears if a cat :-P and they even blink! when they speak back all i can hear is the water bubbling tho so i have to get them out and then they can tell me whats up. usually they say ''come on you cheap bastard throw more food than that!"|`|udLtA7T7aa	Fish do not have ears like we do. They sense movement and vibrations with sensual organs on each side of their head and with their lateral line that runs the full length of their body. They use this as a defense to hide if something large comes their way or as a way of detecting food from the movements of a wounded or dying fish nearby. Some artificial lures are made to churn the water as in a spinner bait. Poppers are also used to make splashing actions and other lures like rattletraps and some diving plugs have pellets inside that make vibrations that the fish can feel from some distance away.|`|zqVDJxUIaa	Even if they did have ears, fish wouldn't be able to understand what you said. In fact, even if they understood English, they still wouldn't be able to perceive what you said. This is because the density of water distorts sound waves, bouncing them off its surface. The sound would not reach the fish. However, if some inexperienced hobbyist taps on the glass (oh the horror!) the fish all swim fast and crash into the walls because the shock wave scares them. (don't try this at home, or anywhere!)<br>  <br>  But fish do in fact get used to you. Whenever I'm looking at the aquarium, some fish swim up to the glass, and look at. Maybe they think I'll give them more food...<br>  My Corydoras catfish will eat out of my hand...<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|45967a4e856bcb43019a0c9d336e0e55aa	No, no kind of fish have ears.  However, they do have a very sensitive strip that runs down their sides that senses vibrations, and I believe some sounds.  So your fish can "hear" you so to speak.<br>  Hope I helped :)|`|ugi4aUZXaa	they do not have ears all they have is pretty much super sensitive nerves that help them sense movement in the water and they can tell how close something is to them. they do not have ears|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Not in the way you or I do, they have lateral lines runing along their sides.  These sense vibrations in the water around them.  That's why aquariums, fish stores and even sea world have "please do not tap the glass" signs posted.  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|ROmhHYAMaa	I would be wrong or right saying this. No, they don't have ears cause i tried talking to my fish and he just ran away. =P<br>  So yeah... LOL<br>  <br>  Good luck with communications.<br>  From David.
1YNhKzeqaa	Goldfish are very messy, they produce lots of ammonia. The solution really is to get a bigger tank.<br>  But instead of yelling at you about what you already know, I'll tell you what you can do until you get your new tank. <br>  <br>  1. Reduce your feedings, less food means less waste means less ammonia.<br>  <br>  2. Keep the pH below 7. Here is the chemistry behind this: ammonia comes in two different forms, ionized and unionized. The ionized form isn't as harmful to the fish and is present when the pH is below 7. The unionized form is dangerous for fish, and is present when the pH is at or above 7.<br>  <br>  3. Do 50% water changes every day.<br>  <br>  4. Get that new tank ASAP!<br>  <br>  Gasping is not due to low oxygen, it is a sign of ammonia poisoning. Air pumps are just a decoration and do not oxygenate the water like you think they would. The gas exchange happens on the surface of the water, the more surface disturbance, the more your water gets oxygenated. The bubbles themselves are not what oxygenates the water, the surface disturbance the bubbles create is what oxygenates the water. As long as your filter disturbs the surface of the water, and as long as you have a filter that does not require an air pump to function you do not need an air pump.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your little fishes! I had my goldfish tank get broken as a kid, and had to keep them in a too-small container until I got a new tank, so I know what you're going through. Good luck and I hope you suffer no losses.|`|NUTpNxSWaa	are you retarted, goldfish need at least 10G per not 1.5, get real, put them in a bigger tank there sucfficatoing i nther own crap.|`|ugi4aUZXaa	i would definately try getting an air pump with a bubble stone just to put even more oxygen in the water i had that problem once and thats what i did and they were fine|`|zqVDJxUIaa	Here's the steps to solve the problem with the high ammonia. First of all, they're suffering from ammonia poisoning. <br>  <br>  Steps: <br>  -change 20% of the water every 1-2 days<br>  -vacuum the gravel every 2 days to remove waste<br>  -use a biological supplement such as Hagen's Cycle to introduce beneficial bacteria (optional)<br>  -get an ammonia neutralizer at your local fish store (such as Am-Rid or Ammo-Lock)<br>  <br>  You might want to get an air pump to further oxygenate the water. Gasping is due to low oxygen levels. A quick fix would be to raise the filter so that the water falls down a higher distance to hit the water. Surface agitation increases oxygen in water.<br>  <br>  I won't give you dumb info on how big your tank needs to be... I really hate when people do that. But try to get the bigger tank ASAP! Your fish need you!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|4a89RvpDaa	they need a larger tank immediately.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Try adding a little aquarium salt to the tank as well, it'll help interfere with the parasites life cycle. Change the water as often as you can, removing at least ten percent per day.  The parasite first strikes their gills, this is why they are panting, long before it's ever visible on their bodies.  When this cyst drops off, it'll fall to the floor to create many more free swimming parasites that can reinfect the fish.  Doing water changes wil help remove them.  The salt will help increase their slime coat and help discourage the parasites as well as help prevent a secondary infection. (they're a bit like  a leach, leaving behind a wound when they drop off).<br>  <br>  Here is an explanation on how the parasite works:<br>  <br>  "White Spot:<br>  White Spot is a protozoan infection caused in freshwater by Ichthyophthirius species and in salt water by Cryptocaryon species. These protozoan parasites spend part of their life cycle embedded in the skin of fish, feeding the tissue and body fluid. This on-fish stage is enclosed in a white cyst, which gives the classical (white spot) symptoms of this disease. The adult emerges from the cyst and drops to the floor of the aquarium where it forms into a protective capsule inside which it multiplies by division. Some days later the capsule bursts and releases hundreds of free-swimming infective parasites which search for a new fish host. Massive infestation, particularly of the gills, leads to respiration problems in the fish, salt balance difficulties, and eventually to death. The white spot life cycle duration depends on the temperature of the water, being only 10-12 hours at 26°C, but 3 weeks at 5°C. The white spot's free-swimming stage is the only stage of the life cycle affected by the treatment. <br>  <br>  White Spot Treatment<br>  A specific White Spot treatment (such as Interpet's Anti White Spot No.6) should be used. These products remain active in the aquarium for several days, so ensuring the free-swimming parasites are destroyed as they emerge from the capsules. You can assist rapid eradication of white spot by raising the aquarium temperature to 26°C, so shortening the life cycle. "<br>  <br>   Unfortuantlly, you can't do the temp thing : ( as temps this high risk the fish as well as the parasite!  Meds, water changes and salt are the way to go.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|TqIdbEBPaa	Feed them every 2-3 days as this will cause them to poop less which in turn, will keep ammonia levels down. Also, change 10% of water everyday. Add Ammo-Lock by API to detoxify the ammonia if it is over .5 ppm.
AJxl0IvHaa	Yes, but let a groomer do it!<br>  They have special stuff!<br>  Or you could use food coloring and a little bit of water.<br>  But i honestly... dont think it looks good.<br>  I like my pets their normal colors!<br>  EDIT::<br>  [[ some people just like to sit on yahoo answer and take their anger out on other people...... and lots of people give false answers... but mine is right... i used to work at a grooming salon..........]]|`|AA10431326	Heck no, are you trying to kill your cat?|`|z2Hax1Zlaa	No it's not okay.

N2jvxYPcaa	You already know that your horse is going to be an unusual size. i wouldn't dream of investing in a saddle until I had him properly saddle fitted by someone unbiased. I can sympathize with having to travel an hour, because I live in rural Alberta and my nearest tack specialists is two or more hours away. But this is going to save you hassles, money and problems in the long run.<br>  My current show mare has huge saddle fitting issues, which I did not realize at first. We started getting behavior issues after a while due to back pain. Solving her saddle fitting issues solved alot of things, but it wasn't easy. I would like to see you solve your problems before things get worse. A horse with chronic pain due to a poorly fitting saddle is going to give you lots of grief.<br>  You might want to consider going onto "Port Lewis Workshop" and looking at their saddle fitting system. They use a gel pad which you put between your horse's back and saddle, and ride. This will show you where your horse is getting pressure points with various saddles. I bought myself one of these testing gel pads. It was fairly expensive, but now I can test all my saddles myself on various horses, so it will save me money in the long run. Good luck.|`|PmwX2VXOaa	google: fitting a saddle|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Before you purchase a saddle invest the money in getting a proper saddle fitter to come out. It may be expensive and annoying, but your horse will thank you for years to come.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	I'd go with a draft size because both types of horses are WIDE.  Take a wire coat hanger and shape it across the highest point of his withers and then take that into the saddle shop when you go shopping.  That's the safest way to find a gullet that works.
penuzN8jaa	Ok, lets start with the preparation!!<br>  <br>  Clip your horse's coat one or even two weeks before the show to give it time to fill in a bit. Clipping your horse right before the halter class is a common mistake that can dock you points. <br>  <br>  Bathe your horse about 2 days before the class to give the coat a chance to restore it's natural oils. Allow the coat to dry and let your horse roll. Maintain that clean shine by using a currycomb or soft, bristled brush regularly in the days leading up to the halter class. <br>  <br>  Trim your horse's mane and tail so that the ends are even. If you are showing English, you should braid both the tail and the main, trimming the ends slightly after the braids are finished. For Western, trim the tail and leave it loose. However, you should band the mane before the show. <br>  <br>  Groom your horse's hooves before the halter classes by first having your farrier trim and reshod the horses hooves. Once neatly trimmed, polish the hooves. If you horse has black or blue hooves, use black polish. Otherwise, use clear. <br>  <br>  Prepare your horse on the day of the halter class by applying a light application of baby powder to any white markings and a coat polish and a fly repellant. Use a damp cloth to wipe around the eyes, ears, mouth and nose. Keep a cloth in your pocket for touch-ups. <br>  <br>  Now you're prepared this is what you do on the day:<br>  <br>  Walk or trot your horse into the arena. The judge will tell you how to enter. <br>  <br>  Prepare to be judged on your horse's conformation (build), how the horse moves, if the horse follows your lead and does what you ask, if the horse can do the required turns, and how the horse stands (the horse should stand squarely on all four feet). <br>  <br>  Follow the judge's instructions. As the judge is looking at your horse, he or she may ask you to trot or walk your horse out of line or turn it around. <br>  <br>  Good luck!! I hope it goes well. Gosh it took me ages to write all that!!<br>  <br>  Stand out of the way of the judge. You never want to interfere with the judge seeing your horse. <br>  <br>  Stand tall and proud, with your head up and shoulders back.|`|8OJZYB3Taa	All i can realy tell you is that it is based on the horse not the handler. like ive watched some and the Handlers will move the horses legs to make them squared up and will do other things. I dont believe there is a patern or anything.|`|jiWHDyS5aa	it depends on which discipline you want to show in....you want your horse to have good conformation and look stunning. you want to look good too. buts its mainly the horse. there usually is no pattern, but sometimes a judge may ask u to walk/trot in front of them(check for lameness) or spin on haunches, etc.<br>  <br>  ***QUESTION***<br>  are you allowed to pick up a horse's feet in a halter class? sry jw...|`|xzJi0bcSaa	Horse Crazy has the prep and the basics right so I wont go into that. You need a well turned out horse and you should be well groomed too, in our shows, horses needed to be able to walk, trot, and halt on command. They also need to be able to "square up" or "park" depending on the breed. <a href="http://www.rainbow1ranch.com/BAILEY%20SHOWMANSHIP.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.rainbow1ranch.com/BAILEY%20SH...</a> here is an example of squared up, and a park is the hind legs extend out further behind. The horse should also be able to pivot on his hindquarters. So basic pattern would be line up, walk to the judge, square up the horse, you need to use the quarter method for moving around the horse when the judge inspects it, I suggest you look that up. Then pivot the horse away from you when the judge asks for it, stop, look back over the horse to make sure you are in a straight line from horses back to judge then trot back to line up. There are more patterns and they should be posted but thats the general gist of showmanship. Hope this helps!|`|jVriLcSLaa	your horse should have impeccable and know how to stand square. a well behaved horse will always win. halter classes are all about how the horse is presented. he should be clean and clipped. body clipping is optional. mane should be done depending of where you go. some places require specific things to be done with the mane some dont care. his feet should be clean and polished. your dress should fit well and wrinkle free. also a show halter will earn you points too|`|sKZbK6Y5aa	hope you like to groom,bathe,and clip. you will have to practice walking,trotting on the lead and setting your horse square and having your horse stand quietly and not on top of you...for as long as maybe 4 or 5 judges get around to judging everyone in the class(which can be upwards of 15 ) have fun!!  **** i see some folks moving the feet with their hands but we were trained never ever touch their feet.  i think it looks unprofessional..***|`|AA10188682	well I was in horse judging for about a year or two. I always did the best in halter. When people are showing in Halter they make sure that their horses are well groomed. A horse that is not well groomed will not make if very far. The horse also must have good poise. I remember my director once saying a horse needs a round rump, not a roller coaster butt. The legs must not be cow-hocked or pigeon toed. That is a another key thing. But when it come to the walking and trotting, it's much different. Your horse must still show great poise. When trotting the hoof prints of the back feet should almost match the hoof prints of the front feet.
rgXM57HYaa	I'm not much of an expert but you probably don't wanna touch the kittens right now. The mom usually flips....<br>  <br>  I never heard that the mother will kill the kittens! :o|`|AA11108627	No, no, no!  The mother won't kill the kittens if you touch them!  <br>  <br>  You are confusing cats and birds!  There is a possibility the mother bird will kick the baby out of the nest if a human contaminates the baby.  But the mother cat wouldn't ever reject her young like that!<br>  <br>  If your cat just had kittens, leave the new family alone!    Let the mother do the mothering!  The mother cat is perfectly able to give the kits what they need at this very vulnerable stage of their lives.  You aren't going to "improve" things by trying to help the mother do what she does best herself!<br>  <br>  Of course, attend to the needs of the mother cat.  Make sure she is well fed, has fresh water & gets her rest.  Naturally, it's tempting to want to see the newborn kits, but try to respect the cat's "visiting hours" while she recovers from childbirth and attends to the needs of her new children!<br>  <br>  When the kits grow a little more, after their eyes open and they begin trying to walk, then you can go ahead and handle them some more.  But it is frightening for newborn kits to be handled by these strange humans, and the mother won't be so crazy about it either.  Let them get their milk and comfort from being with their mom.  Trust mom to do her job, and let things develop as naturally as possible.<br>  <br>  And please don't worry!  Congrats on the new kits!|`|tnTxHVO5aa	The kittens will be fine.  If she is bothered by you touching them she will move them and hide them from you.|`|50azgKE8aa	They should be fine.  Calm down!  One of my cats had two litters of kittens and we picked them up and mved them soon after they were born.  And everything was fine.  Usually the only time a mother cat will kill her kittens is if they have a deformity of some kind, whether it be mental or physical.   Even then that doesnt happen often.  Just keep an eye on her if that makes you feel better.  Make sure shes letting all the kittens nurse and not excluding any.  If she is then ypu need to get him to the vet fast to see whats up.  And if that does happen bottle feed it kitten's formula milk.  Which you can buy at almost any pet store. <br>  I hope i helped.  And remeber dont worry to much and give the mother some space.|`|srjPOxW7aa	No, that's if you touch baby birds, that or their mom will ignore them. Anyway, just give the mom of your cat some space (mother cats like their privacy) and only check in on her once in a while, keep her food and water near her so she doesn't have to travel far from her kittens.|`|0xBvybIxaa	i got some answers about my pregnant dog...sure it's the same, but let her tend to them for awhile..if she isn't getting all of them. wipe them off and use a nose thingy to get it out of their nose and mouth. and stimulate them. with a rag on their butt and tummy, but be very very careful.<br>  good luck and congrats|`|5eUoENzuaa	Both of my cats are desexed, but my friends cat gave birth not too long ago, and the mother was very protective of the kittens. It is true than if a cat looks the smell of its young it can sometime abandon them, so you would be best of just putting out some food and water for the mother, so she has enough energy to produce milk for them. Do not move anything in the area the cat is in, especially the blankets and such she is resting on.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about the safety of the cats, then you should look up your local vet, and give them a call. :)|`|AacmVYD9aa	depending on your relationship to the cat... she will not just kill her kittens.. in time of need she would let most people she knew help in her situation. If she trusts you before she had them she is ok with you touching them now.. do not handle them to much out of fear for infections or disease. If you have a air push... looks  like a small turkey baster or referred to as "booger sucker" you may use it gently to help if not try a wet cloth. hope that helps!!|`|MP24WKZkaa	she wont kill them, but dont touch them for the first few days, and try not to touch them til there eyes open, wile there newborns, there very fragile. so if you ever need to  hold them be very carefull.<br>  its best to leave them alone. iv always had cats, but we never had enuf money to take them to a vet when they had kittens. and i just couldnt help myself wile the wer newborns. lol. i cant wait for kittens to be ready for me. its ok, she wont kill them. but if they dont have there sent that she remebers , she may not take them back|`|2ImIgJwXaa	My cat has had a couple litters of kittens-n my dogs also. But we have to help every time almost. And the mother doesn't eat them. I think as long as she is tame and not wild it doesn't really apply. She knows you well obviously and if she seems to want you around, stay around.|`|Gf4MVn3Daa	My cat had kittens. don't worry, the mother knows your scent and WILL NOT kill them if you touch them.<br>  get a clean, warm rag and clean the kittens gently if you need to. thats what i did.|`|3kpZrtmdaa	Its Okay She Wont Kill Them
hEXb1unraa	I would not advise using something as harsh as peroxide on your horses skin.......even if its just the mane and tail your are still getting skin contact and in her bloodstream.....that stuff can burn and even worse make all your horses mane and tail hair fall out....Please dont do it....If you want to dye your horses M&T use those temp 30 day dyes...you could probably get away with some weird colors.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	It wouldn't hurt her, but it's kind of a dumb thing to do.

I do use peroxide on wounds when they first happen though. Repeated use on wounds would do more harm than good, so be careful when trying to dye hair. <br>  <br>  Personally, I would try a few hairs then check back the next day.|`|vGSKe2sKaa	A person at my barn tried it, and it just turned the horses tail like orangey brown. Definitely test a small section that isn't too obvious to make sure that this won't happen to your horse.

CuP846Ezaa	I suppose it depends on what space yo have as to what breed you should get. If you only have small acerage then the smallers breed would be less as require less feed. I dont know where you are but here in Australia they are breeds like Lowlines and Dexters...generally a three quarter size cow. Larger breeds are fine if you have the space of course. The other question would be are you planning on getting full grown or are you going to get a poddy calf and hand rasie it? If you havd raise the calf and bottle feed it the breed would really matter. They become really tame and easy to handle, but in saying that keep in mind that they are always an animal and a large one at that and they can accidently hurt you. Ive raised many calves up and they can still be patted and hand fed, breeds from Brahmans to Jersey crosses. If you want it as a pet then I would say thats the way to go, hand raise it.

If you breed your cow, you will need to milk it at least once a day, preferably twice.  Also, make sure you have some sort of shelter for it and a big enough space for it to get exercise and to graze.
penuzN8jaa	You really need to think and have a chat with your parents but this is a rough guide!!<br>  <br>  Livery or Field Rent<br>  Farmers or others may have fields available to rent for horses and these are usually the lowest cost at around ￡10 per week. However, these usually have very few facilities available and horse owners may be responsible for the maintenance of the field...<br>  <br>  The choice for most horse owners is to keep their horses at a Livery Yard and these often have a range of facilities available including tack rooms, schooling arenas, muck heap, jumps, etc. Another advantage of a Livery Yard is that they fully maintain the fields used.<br>  <br>  Grass Livery can be expected to cost in the region of ￡20-￡25 per week and covers field rent. Depending on the yard it may also include use of the yard facilties.<br>  <br>  Stabled Livery can be expected to cost around ￡30-￡40 per week and this covers the rent of the stable and use of a paddock or field for turnout.<br>  <br>  Any care of the horse or duties carried out by staff at the livery yard will cost extra.<br>  <br>  Hay, Straw and Shavings<br>  For horses kept on grass livery hay is normally only required to be fed in winter when grass is scarce and the amount required will vary depending on the type and size of horse or pony. It should be expected that some hay will be needed to be fed for around 5 months of the year with up to ￡10 a week being added to the costs during the severest winter weeks when grass is totally unavailable!!!<br>  <br>  For stabled horses hay is required all year round to compensate for the lack of access to grass whilst stabled and so can add around ￡10 a week to the costs throughout the year. Also some form of stable bedding is required, usually straw or shavings, and this can add a further ￡10-￡20 per week to the costs throughout the year!!!<br>  <br>  Feed<br>  The amount of feed required will depend on the type and size of horse, its exercise routine and whether it it is stabled or at grass.<br>  <br>  A hardy horse or pony living out all year and only receiving light exercise may need little additional feed if any. However a horse receiving regular exercise may require some hard feed and a stabled horse, with regular strenuous exercise will need additional feed throughout the year costing around 5-10 a week.<br>  <br>  Vet's Fees and Insurance<br>  A horse or pony requires annual innoculations against Influenza and Tetanus and can be expected to cost in the region of 35 a year for the vaccination plus around ￡35 callout charge from the vet.<br>  <br>  Vet's fees in cases of illness or accident can be costly, and rather than risk having to pay out several hundred or thousand pounds for an incident many owners prefer to insure their horse against such fees. The cost of insurance to cover vets fees will vary depending on the type of cover taken and the value of the horse or pony but should be expected to be in the region ￡20-￡40 per month or more.<br>  <br>  Farrier<br>  A horse's feet continually grow and so even if unshod will require regular visits from the farrier for trimming. Whether shod or not the horse will require attention from the farrier every 6 weeks and this can cost around ￡25 for trimming and ￡50-￡55 for shoeing per visit.<br>  <br>  Dentist<br>  It is recommended that a horse has its teeth checked by a vet or equine dentist every year to ensure that there are no sharp edges or other tooth problems that may be the cause of discomfort to the horse. This costs around ￡50-￡70 per visit.<br>  <br>  Worming<br>  Horses and ponies need to be regularly wormed whether stabled or at grass. Worming costs around ￡10-￡15 and is usually required every 6-8 weeks.<br>  <br>  Summary<br>  This is a little table made by me, the prices on top are the ones of a Horse or Pony at Grass and the ones on the bottom are Stabled Horse or Pony. This is per year!!<br>  <br>  Item<br>   Horse or Pony at Grass<br>   Stabled Horse or Pony<br>   <br>  Livery<br>   ￡1,040-￡1,300<br>   ￡1,560-￡2,080<br>   <br>  Hay, Straw and Shavings<br>   ￡140-￡220<br>   ￡1,040-￡1,560<br>   <br>  Feed<br>   ￡100-￡200<br>   ￡260-￡520<br>   <br>  Vet's Fees<br>   ￡70<br>   ￡70<br>   <br>  Insurance<br>   ￡240-￡480<br>   ￡240-￡480<br>   <br>  Farrier<br>   ￡225-￡495<br>   ￡225-￡495<br>   <br>  Dentist<br>   ￡50-￡70<br>   ￡50-￡70<br>   <br>  Worming<br>   ￡90-￡135<br>   ￡90-￡135<br>   <br>  Total<br>   ￡1,955-￡2,970<br>   ￡3,535-￡5,410<br>  <br>  Wow that took me ageeeesss!!!!<br>  xxxxxx|`|H2gwQac6aa	Horses are very expensive and not cheap, you need to remember you arent just paying for the food stable and the horse you are paying for things like food, the price of the horse, stable rent, farrier, insurance for both you and the horse, the horses wardrobe and EVERYTHING it needs, teeth checks, back checks, hay and straw or shavings and much more!<br>  you need to remember you are only 12 and havent been riding that long, as you are still so young you might not appriciate owning a horse and may loose interest, i know 15 year olds who have been riding for 9 years and have there own horses and have lost interest, its all alot to think about, i suggest you should carry on with your riding and gain full understanding about the care and commitments of owning a horse.<br>  good luck in the future.|`|5kUxkun3aa	i would see if anyone in your area has a pony to loan. we have alot in our area. you pay for things like shoes,and riders insurance. you get to ride it and they pay food and do some of the day to day care.<br>  you would have someone else making sure everything is ok,as you haven't alot of experience.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	I would have to say no, probably not. Im not sure about prices in England but here in the US, on average, I spend about $600 a year on hay, $75+ on grain, $200 on shavings (bedding), $200+a year on vaccinations/wormer, $100/horse/month on board (and thats really cheap),$40 every 6-8 weeks for hoof trimming, plus tack which isnt cheap Ive probably spent around $1200 for all my tack, acquired over the years and most of it used, plus the actual cost of the horse, my gelding was around $1200 and my mare was $500 but neither of them were very broke and I know how to train so, it was a good deal for me. It adds up to be quite a bit plus money for emergencies. I would maybe suggest working at a stable nearby and maybe getting lessons instead. Love of a horse just isnt enough to own one, you need dedication and time and of course, money. Im sorry to be such a downer but, horses cost a lot of money. Hope this helps.|`|Hwra2uj4aa	If I were you, I would wait. When you get a horse, especially when you dont have enough money, sometimes it can be a nightmare. When you get a horse, you have to sacrifice everything else you would spend money one - expensive clothes, movies, going out, etc. I would also wait until you are older and you are sure you want to keep riding, it also looks like you may have limited time for it. For some people, its just a 'phase'. I have been riding for 13 years, and still dont have a horse. I understand why my parents refused, and it looks like I may finally be able to afford one this year. Just enjoy  your lessons, and maybe down the track when you are serious about riding you can talk to your parents about it.|`|jVriLcSLaa	are you looking for a horse to ride or just to take care of. horses are expensive. they need the vet to come out to give them shots twice a year. there feet done every 7 weeks and there teeth should be done every six monthes. you have to pay for hay and grain too.<br>  <br>  if you are looking for a horse just to take care of that can be very cheap if you find one without health issues. many people have retired horses just looking to be let out in a field to enjoy the rest of there days. and some you can still take light rides on.|`|8OJZYB3Taa	Here in the US on average on one horse i spend $2,700 on one year of boarding, for grain $600 on grain. then you have to consider the price of the horse,the price of tack needed, i spend about $700 on farrier, then you got vet costs. Its alot. My suggestion lease a horse instead of buying.|`|l3zdxJREaa	Hi, when I was about your age(I'm now 14) I wanted a horse so badly too!<br>  Anyway, I knew my family really couldn't afford a horse-remember, you have to pay for an awful lot, not just the actual horse! <br>  So because we couldn't afford a horse, I just hung around my stables nearly every day and helped out in them. This actually helped me sooo much because I learned a lot about taking care of horses and also that I hardly knew anything about them in the first place!!<br>  My advice is to try and organize to do something like that. As you say, you aren't very wealthy, so you don't want to put your family under any extra financial strain.<br>  If you still really want a horse, talk it over with your parents, and then talk to someone who lives in your area to see how much it might cost around(livery, shoes, vet bills, tack).<br>  I am now sharing a horse with my friend and it's great, that's something else to consider.<br>  Good Luck:)
5RRMLzvzaa	I'm in the USA, so I can't account for any cultural differences.  Here, though, grooms and stall muckers make very little - usually not much better than minimum wage.  Being a groom for expensive show horses would probably pay better, but I can't imagine you can get rich doing that.  People who are skilled at braiding can charge a good amount to braid horses for shows, but again, I don't think that could be a full time job.<br>  <br>  If you get to be very good, you can definitely make a living as an instructor, but not many do.  If you are an instructor at someone else's stable, the pay is again usually not very good.  I teach beginner and intermediate lessons to kids at a camp, and I make very very little.  I do it on the side because I enjoy it, definitely not for the money.  You would have to be the main trainer to make the money from it.<br>  <br>  University is not required to work with horses, as it's the sort of field where you can gain knowledge through experience.  You WOULD need university to be a vet, etc, and having a degree in horses would certainly help at any rate as it gives you credability.  My trainer has a degree in equine nutrition, and that gives people confidence when they board at his barn, for example.  You'd need to find a mentor to work under if you want to go the no-university route, and you'll have to work long and hard for next to nothing for quite some time before you could get good enough to branch out and get your own clients.
zqVDJxUIaa	Yes, they should be fine, except maybe the catfish. The cichlids might be a bit aggressive towards it, but if you introduce the aggressive ones last, then they will be less aggressive, because they are getting used to their surroundings. You might be able to add some other large cichlids, but obviously not any small tropical schooling fish. You should have approximately one inch of cichlid to 5 gallons of water, to give lots of room and hiding places. I'd substitute the cat for some more cichlids. You could get some more of the same cichlids, to try to breed them, but you could also add some other species of cichlids. (5 at most)<br>  Live plants would also help.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	2-3 Red Belly Pacus, they get very big and they are very aggressive, but they go well with your mixture.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|ugi4aUZXaa	you could put red devils in with them or any other kind of cichlid as long as they are around the same size as the others. oscars and jack dempseys are cichlids so any other cichlid will be fine. i would keep what you have now though for a little whiel let them get used to the environment and slowly add more fish because if you add to many at one time its to stressful on the fish and you will end up killing fish that way.

After awhile, you realize how lucky you were to have him in your life and accept that he is really gone.  It's ok to be upset- this just happened- you may feel like this for longer than you expect but feel it and try to get it all out- do whatever you need to do to achieve this.  If you eventually feel ready, get another dog- maybe a female pit instead.

We still have that dog, Marcuss, and another adopted pit bull, Zoe.  We gave them homes when they were about to be put down.  Adopting again, may be a good choice, but make sure that you are ready for a dog again and are not getting one solely to fill that hole.  I hope you feel better soon.

jUnFWPpuaa	He probably fell off the bed or the couch. He is a small dog and it doesn't take much for them to get hurt. My advise would be to call around the vets offices and ask them if they can do a payment plan for a student. Sometimes they will. It just depends. Ask someone close to you if they can help you out. A vet visit isn't that expensive. If you can not afford x-rays or whatever just let them know that. There is really no other choice. He needs a Doctor if he is really hurt.|`|kceGobAXaa	Pick him up for a cuddle and gently touch him all over - see if you can find any area that is giving him pain.  Just be very gentle and rub and lightly prod him.  If he is in pain, he would be shaking as we all know Chi's do.  It could just be that you picked him up wrong and he got a little pain, my dogs have yelped if I have given them a shock when I touched them.  It very well could have been just the way he was picked up.  If you are still worried, find an emergency vet and call or take him in.  <br>  <br>  This sounds awful, but do not tell a vet that you can't afford to pay.  Any decent vet will work with a payment schedule or whatever.  Your pet's health should come first.|`|LURQBU86aa	Multiple things could be causing this pain.

KeevlZnTaa	Some people just don't understand rats, b/c most of these people have never encountered a pet rat before. They rely on preconceived ideas that they have without knowing actual facts. <br>  <br>  I remember when I wanted my first rat(I was living at home). My mother was really upset when I brought my first girl home(spent my entire first paycheck on all the supplies). She thought they were gross, dirty etc. it took her a few weeks to warm up to them and start to like them. My grandmother also hated them, and changed her mind quickly. I always thought it was funny when I would catch her shelling and feeding them peanuts when no one was looking. <br>  <br>  I've had rats for about 7 years now, probably over 50 of them have come and gone. They are the best pets that I have ever owned. Rats have very similar personalities to dogs, they really bond closely with their family, and enjoy being with their people and rat friends. <br>  <br>  It is a shame that more people cannot look past the early rat history, and the tail(as I have found that is most people's issue), and really see what it is like to own a rat. They have no idea what they are missing out on. You and I, we are fortunate enough to know what it is like to have a rat or two in our lives. I don't get angry with those who don't like them, I just feel sorry they can't get past those preconceived notions, and get to enjoy at rat as well.|`|Z9xy3Mwxaa	i have rats they are the best kind of rodent u can ask for i think|`|bexpzOGfaa	I think when people think of rats they think about the dirty sewage rats. Pet rats are actually very clean and very smart, and usually seem to be friendly. People Who are saying those things don't know a lot about animals, and in tell they've had pet rats or been around pet rats they have no right to judge.

wnnudNp5aa	As long as you are regularly brushing and combing it's coat, and it hasn't gotten into something yucky, there isn't any real need or benefit to bathe a cat. I know show cats are often bathed and groomed, but we aren't talking about show cats, are we? Cats, in general, do a very good job of keeping themselves fresh and clean. The possible exceptions being very old or sick cats. Those may need their human's help staying nice and clean. But for the average cat, bathing is a stressful, unproductive, and frightening experience. Just keep up with the brushing and combing, and your cat will take care of the rest!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	None unless the cat has gotten into something toxic/too messy to clean themselves.  Bathing is stressful for the cat and doing it too often can dry the skin.  I have several longer haired cats and have only given one of them a bath when he had diarrhea and got poop on his tail.  That was only meant to be a tail wash but it turned into a bath for both of us. Cats are designed to clean themselves and they do a good job of it.  Trimming around the anus can reduce messes from pooping and regular grooming with a good cat comb (better than a brush) will keep the fur looking nice and cut down on shedding.  A good diet is also essential to stop excessive shedding.  If you must, there are cat wipes you can buy at pet stores to freshen him up...a better solution than bathing.|`|ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	it won't shed, lick or stink as much|`|6MQsUhHLaa	a whole new skin patteren. seriously, 1234 is right, but i would highly recomed using a warm wet well wrung out cloth insted of a bath. i have a kitty who got hit by a car and got a broken shoulder that never quite healed right, he has trouble keeping up and reaching to clean some spots, so every now and then i give him a good rub down. he likes it as long as none of the other cats are looking.  :)|`|A1iDPPOeaa	Saves on the cost of a witch doctor in performing bloodletting on the cat's owner.

Please don't breed your cat unless you know exactly how, have had cats for a long time, researched cats a lot (about 5 years at the least), etc.<br>  There is an overpopulation of cats and dogs around the world, and bringing more kittens (that were bred irresponsibly. Though I'm not implying your irresponsible) into this world.<br>  <br>  The best book I have ever read was the ASPCA Complete Guide to Cats- Choosing and Caring for Your Pet.<br>  There is more information on that book on my profile if you would like to take a look!<br>  <br>  There are many cat books out there, and I have only read a few (about 120). So, just one book will not have all the information you need, many book have different information but just because you read it in a book doesn't make it true. I try to avoid books with a lot of theory or religious beliefs in them. I have my own beliefs about the world and just shake my head when a book says otherwise. I don't want to waste my time on theory.<br>  <br>  Follow up on the information you read in a book, and research on the internet, with other books, common sense, and by talking to breeders or experienced cat owners.<br>  <br>  Now, you need to pick up the right book by looking at the title.

Whichever one is causing trouble.)<br>  <br>  Temperaments in cats can vary, and some breeds have health problems that have developed over the years while breeding.<br>  <br>  If you are going to breed (please don't) then you must learn all of the terms, everything you possibly can about that breed, you have to have a large (very large) amount of space, lots of money, and a lot of time. Are you up for it? Do you have the tools you need?<br>  <br>  Cat Temperaments:<br>  <br>  Well, there are a lot. Every cat has it's own personality though!

Not only are there so many cats in the world already waiting for homes, but it is fraught with dangers not only for the mom but also the kittens.  it is not as simple as putting a female and male together and poof you have kittens 63 days later (although that does work) you need to do health care on the mom before pregnancy, health care on her while she's pregnant, and then there are risks of problems during birth and so you have the financial burden of caring for that, as well as the vaccinations and deworming of the kittens - and it would be a good idea for you to also neuter the kittens as well - another big expense.<br>  <br>  people who breed are not in it for the money, they often loose money in the process.

jr2yqSJqaa	First off, I am so, so very sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  I have had rabbits for over a decade so I know what you are going through.<br>  <br>  Anesthesia is VERY tricky when it comes to rabbits because of their delicate systems.  Do you know if your rabbit had gas or injection anesthesia?  Gas is safer but also a risk.  Was all of this explained to you by your vet?  Also, you must see a veterinarian who knows how to deal with rabbits (considered "exotic" pets) as most are only knowlegeble with cats and dogs.  It is harder to find one who does know about rabbits but they are out there.  It seems strange to me that he had to have two pre-op checks which is unusual.  Was he an older rabbit?  All of my bunnies (I've had three at once) were neutered and had zero complications.  One even underwent surgery for malclussion (over grown teeth) and he was also fine.  In each case they were "masked" (had gas anesthesia).<br>  <br>  I lost two of my three bunnies on November 3, 2007 within hours of each other.  One was blind from cataracts in one eye for 18 months and the other eye for 6.  He totally depended on one of my other bunnies and when that bunny got sick - he got splay leg where he could no longer stand up - and he died next to the one who depended on him, he only lasted about 4 hours without him.  It was one of the hardest days of my life so I do understand your pain.  Both were almost 10 years old and my other bunny who will be 10 in a few weeks time just had anesthesia two weeks ago in order to undergo an x-ray.  He had an upper respitory infection and just finished a round of antibiotics and he is just fine.  He was also masked and in and out and in my arms in less than a half an hour with no side effects but my vet is very knowlegeble with rabbits.<br>  <br>  No one should ever have to suffer the loss of a beloved pet under any circumstances but something like this happening is truly unbearable.<br>  <br>  My thoughts are with you and I hope you will be able to come through this very difficult loss in time.  Just know that people do care about you and pay no mind to those who come here to make jokes or say awful things.<br>  <br>  He has crossed the "Rainbow Bridge" but you will be reunited with your beautiful, sweet bunny one day and he will be in your loving arms once more.|`|vwC7klVVaa	Any anaesthetic is dangerous in humans and animals. I have had several rabbit and they have all been neutered and had other things done under anaesthetic and i have only every lost one .

I'm sorry you lost yours it was just bad luck.|`|AA11099573	Poor you, it was too much stress on rabbits heart, the vets did all they could to prevent anything happening to your rabbit..<br>  Rabbits get scared easily and he loved you though x|`|GHL9sH1Naa	rabbits drop dead all the time they are soo skinny and they can't handle stress well<br>  sorry for yor rabbit|`|hqnYJV38aa	that is always a concern with any animal going under anesthesia, despite the breed. Perhaps the vet wasn't really up on exotics and didn't know the proper dosage for the rabbit. That's what my logical side says, but as a previous poster said, maybe the rabbit's heart just wasn't strong enough to sustain the beat under anesthesia, or maybe he was allergic to some medication they gave him. <br>  <br>  It's a sad truth but it does happen. Just remember the good times you had with your rabbit while he was alive.|`|CT3t80suaa	Rabbits, as with humans, can react in many different ways to drugs.

1Qh9i9cWaa	Actually, there may be a number of reasons that your betta's color is fading. Bettas should eat mainly betta flakes (which helps maintain their color) with a treat a couple times a week. My bettas like both brine shrimp (sometimes freeze dried, sometimes reconstituted) and bloodworms (i.e. mosquito larva--freeze dried only).<br>  <br>  You didn't say how you're keeping your betta. A lot of people keep bettas in small bowls or tanks. Bettas, however, prefer larger spaces (5 gal. minimum) with filtered water (although the filter should not be too strong as they are poor swimmers--consider their natural habitat) and a heater. Bettas will get sluggish if the water is kept too cold. The water should have a change of at least 10% once a week and the new water should be treated with a betta water conditioner.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, bettas also tend to fade with age. They also fade if they're diseased. There are a number of diseases that cause color fading. If none of the other answers work, I would get a broad spectrum antibiotic (take out any activated charcoal or charcoal filter before putting the antibiotic in. Also, if you have any other fish in the tank (yes, you can put other fish with a betta), you should remove the betta to a quarintine tank before treating him).<br>  <br>  Light shouldn't have any affect on a betta unless he's getting constant light and doesn't have the ability to sleep, in which case he's stressed|`|AA11708471	because Bettas need 5+ gallon heated and filtered aquariums not bowls<br>  bowls are animal cruelty|`|ubImTehVaa	it could just be the light in your tank being at a different color so the colour doesn't stand out as it did at the store. or it may be the water quality water temp ect. how long ago you brought him?  i brought mine and i did have many fish die in that tank due to poor water conditions but my betta didnt get ill. they are pretty hardy fish so i suppose it must be something really hard that made him ill|`|1orBemFyaa	hes either maturing, or hes stressed.  i have no experience with bettas, but i know that fish like them get dull when they mature.  and i also know that it dulls when theyre stressed.  so maybe check your parameters.  best of luck!|`|01AdxToLaa	BETTA FISH USUALLY LOSE THEIR COLOR WHEN THEY ARE SICK THEY TURN WHITE WHEN THEY DIE I HAVE ALOT OF THEM THAT I PURCHASED THAT DIED RIGHT AFTER I BOUGHT THEM|`|ceebuRIIaa	he probally  is sick|`|ugi4aUZXaa	what color gravel do you have in with your fish because alot of people think the fish is loosing color after they bring it home because the color of the surroundings is different. lets say you have a white fish with white gravel and bright plants around it it wont look as bright as if you would have black gravel and darker plants in with the fish.
zqVDJxUIaa	Get the Betta some live plants. Live plants promote natural behavior. Here are the advantages of plants:<br>  -Provide a source of oxygen<br>  -Absorbs Carbon Dioxide<br>  -Removes toxins from the water<br>  -Reduces algae by competing for light and nutrients<br>  -Provide a hiding place for fish<br>  -Provides a good place for breeding<br>  -Very attractive<br>  A cave or rock structure would also be nice. If you have a small tank, just the plant would be fine as well.<br>  <br>  If he's stressed, there is nothing you can do. However, stress usually leads to disease. I'd monitor the Betta carefully for signs of disease. To diagnose and treat freshwater diseases:<br>  <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/Disease.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/Disease.htm</a><br>  <br>  Also, the addition of Aqua Plus (a water conditioner) may help reduce stress. <br>  <br>  P.S.

Mzvp1LPFaa	Dogs don't menstruate (shed the uterine lining).  Only primates do.  It's a very demanding thing to do so typically only creatures in energy rich environments do so.  When a female dog comes into heat,  she becomes very vascularized in the vaginal area.  Blood seeps out of the capillaries due to the congestion, and that is the blood you see.  If she is not bred, the eggs are not fertilized, and the uterine lining is reabsorbed by the body rather than discarded.<br>  <br>  Most dogs cycle twice a year, a few as many as 3 times per year (I did get in a rescue Aussie who was in standing heat while her pups were barely 4 mo old).  The first week is proestrus where the body is getting ready to release the mature eggs.  At this point the blood is red.  In the second week the discharge becomes straw colored and she is ready to mate with males.  This phase averages about a week.  For the third week she is leaving  estrus and will no longer allow males to breed her.  She is either pregnant or not  pregnant; either way she is done with the breeding.  She needs to be kept locked away from males of any age for the full 3 weeks.  You wouldn't believe what dogs will do to get at the object of their desire.  I watched a male collie bash open a side door to the garage to get to his girlfriend inside.|`|PM23RDycaa	Dogs don't menstruate. The Estrus/Heat cycles lasts 3 weeks on average and is every 6 months on average.|`|cvNN6l9Daa	Dogs go into estrus, which is totally different than human menstruation.  Right before a woman starts to menstruate, she ovulates.  If no pregnancy occurs, the uterine lining then sloughs and bleeding occurs.  Women cannot get pregnant during their period.  This happens roughly every 28 days.<br>  <br>  Contrast this to dogs.  They go into estrus every 6 months.  They do not bleed the whole time and they are only fertile for part of that time.   This can last up to 6 weeks.  There are two cycles, proestrus and estrus.  Each can last anywhere from 2-21 days.|`|Bw18seFqaa	dogs dont menstruate... women do.<br>  <br>  The difference?<br>  <br>  A woman ovulates..  when the egg doesn fertilize, menstruation occourse to flush out the uterus and the cycle starts again..  menstruation occours because a pregnancy did not.<br>  <br>  Dogs go thru estrus.. they ovulate while they are bleeding..  estrus occours to prepare the body for a pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Dogs are in heat approx 21 days..  most cycle every 6 months (some may be more, some may be less)|`|JaFbuUUWaa	I am no pro, but I think they can last anywhere from 2-4 weeks and are usually 2 times a year, but up to 4 in some dogs, just like humans it varies. Google it :)|`|EWXzNyk8aa	The average number of days is about 21 days, or 3 weeks. But it varies from dog to dog. Most dogs come into heat about every 6 months, but that also varies from dog to dog.|`|pQ2ookbNaa	Female dogs are in the heat cycle for a 4 weeks.  There is a week of heat, then two weeks of bleeding, then a week of heat.
M3jRtq2Aaa	Is she nesting? or pushing?  It could be labor, but panting alone doesn't necessarily mean it is labor.|`|PM23RDycaa	Ask your vet or breed mentor. A reputable breed would have both and be able to contact either whenever needed.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I posted this on your other question.<br>  <br>  if she is around 60-63 days it means she is going into labor. She should start nesting as well, her milk would be full and her vulva would be swollen.<br>  <br>  I see in your other question that she is only at day 57 which is a bit too early for the pups to survive if she is in labor. Is the house extra hot? She could just be hot.<br>  <br>  Another possibility is pre-eclampsia, low sodium. They will start to pant heavily, will not be able to stand, will go into seizures and die if not treated. this is an emergency.You should call the vet and describe the symptoms and see what he suggests.|`|veDvtYhJaa	She sounds like she's going into labor.  I hope you have a mentor you can call.  You're not quite prepared, however, even if everything else is.  If YOU were prepared you'd have known the answer to your question.  Keep a close eye on her. -!-|`|16XpYCBmaa	If she is panting then this means she is in labor. I would say in the next 12 to 24 hours she should be having them. Good Luck I hope everything goes well :)|`|fgxajTiBaa	Your breeding mentor should be able to take your call at anytime of day, because of course you are only breeding top quality genetically tested dogs.|`|z2b8Y3E9aa	Is she trying dig into the floor?  Is she pacing back and forth? stopped eating?  She may be starting larbor.  I have assisted to litter deliveries for family dogs (for anyone who is concerned, they were responsible, planned litters).  anyway, if you have a whelping box great.  Encourage her to lay down in it.  When she starts to have puppies keep track of after birth.  One set for every puppy,  she may want to eat it, thats okay, but she may get sick to her tummy.  She should help the pups out of their sacks, if not you will need to do it.  Make sure they stay warm and that she doesn't roll over on them (she will be exhausted).  If possible get a helper that the dog knows.  Good luck|`|UajbVdM4aa	Okay my dog has had puppies too and the puppies are supposed to be  born at around 60 days so she is really close to giving birth.

This is obviously an accidental pregnancy. If it was planned you would know exactly what to do. I hate to sound mean..but I just get so tired of irresponsible pet owners.|`|CcESWX5vaa	put her in a room  thats quiet n put a blanket down for her see if she starts nesting.
HJa7cVFMaa	It may be better for you to put your hamster in another room. It is often thought by many people that handling an animal triggers an allergic reaction. This is not the case, one of the major causes of allergic reactions in humans to animals, is not the hair or fur, but what is actually under it. Any furred or feathered animal is a potential source of animal allergens. Small scales of dead or old skin particles shed from the animal is known as dander. This is very similar to dandruff on humans, but only much smaller. Dander occurs naturally as the epidermis, the outer layer of skin renews itself. Dander can have allergic reactions to sensitive individuals. These reactions can range from inflammation of the nose and eyes to asthma attacks. Dander is so small and light it can remain airborne for long periods of time. Its ability to remain airborne and then spread to every area of the house makes it extremely difficult to control. The animal’s hair / fur is not considered to be a very significant allergen. Older animals produce more dander than young ones because their skin is drier.<br>  <br>  Hamster Breeder|`|tdJ1wE7daa	A litter box could help the stink, but I don't know how to help you with the whole allergic thing. You can buy special litter boxes and litter for hamsters at the pet store.|`|2cd3d2c0f6c6a8ff7014103038b8a67baa	i know i am allergic to my guinea pig but thankfully its not too bad to be un comfortable.  <br>  <br>  when i pick her up i get itchy on my neck and face.  my hands are fine.  i have to wash my hands and face for it too go away.  i still love her though and i just deal with it.|`|GtBOQPKqaa	You could be sensitive to SOME kind of irritant in the hamster's cage. For that, you should see a specialist.<br>  <br>  You don't indicate whether an odor was present before you moved the hamster to your room.<br>  <br>  Cleanliness is key, especially for hamster health. Are you changing just the bedding? You may have to wash the cage thoroughly every time you do, to remove allergens.<br>  <br>  When I had mine, I washed their cages thoroughly with Dawn detergent and from time to time, with baking soda. I then rinsed them off and dried them, using fresh bedding and food.<br>  <br>  If you follow this advice, it SHOULD help you deal with the problem, as will washing your hands every time after handling your pet.

LURQBU86aa	Make sure you are feeding him a high quality food such as Canidae, Innova, Blue Buffalo, Wellness, or Solid Gold. Look at dog food labels and try to find the brand with the highest caloric content. Try adding some canned food to his diet as well. I'm assuming since you vet said he was fine that he was tested for parasites, but if he hasn't been you should take a stool sample to your vet and have it tested.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Maybe it is your brand of dog food. Get a better one. There are Satin Balls that are supposed to help a dog gain weight, but I hesitate to recommend them. They are high fat and you run the risk of pancreatitis.|`|71i6IjdZaa	Take him to another vet love, and see what they think:)<br>  xx|`|Z9xy3Mwxaa	my cocker spanial puppy is bonny to and the vet said hes at a great weight but idk what to say about the weak part|`|AA11256693	I would find a holistic vet or pet nutritionist - start finding information online. Likely what is happening is the dog is allergic to one of the grain or soy ingredients in his food.  I would change food brands to something with NO corn in it first - and also supplement with egg yolks (raw or cooked), and vegetables like carrots (raw or cooked), green beans (cooked) and other healthy foods.  No onions though, onions are bad for dogs. Also, a nutritionist might recommend a healthy oil as well.<br>  Another nice treat is soup/knuckle bones from the meat counter - raw though, not cooked. Cooked bones are brittle and can splinter, raw bones are soft and can be chewed up.  Only give enough to be eaten at one time however, you don't want a pile of them in the yard rotting. I would do organic or grass fed, because I think they are healthier, but that is up to your preference/availability.|`|jUnFWPpuaa	My advise would be to get him on a good quality food if he isn't already. Does he eat every time that you feed him? Sometimes, some dogs have a very high metabolism. He could also have hyperthyroidism. We have this one cat that is a patient at our hospital who has it. He eats as much as a medium size 30 pound dog would eat everyday. He scarfs his food like he is starving all the time. He weighs 8 pounds and he is skin and bone. You would think that the cat hadn't eaten in weeks. Also, like i said, he just may be running off all of his food. Take a German Shepherd for instance, most of them look skinny until they are about 2 years old. I don't know what else to tell you except maybe try giving him doggy vitamins everyday. I hope that he gets some weight on him so you won't worry so much. You sound like me, i worry about my three dogs all the time. The people i work with make fun of me about it. They tell me i better never have children because we would stay at the pediatricians office.|`|pcUAErpQaa	Well, first the finacial needs. Excercise, food, hygiene, love.  I suggest you take him to the clinic
Dkb2ZR3Daa	Absolutley!<br>  Most clinics have a specialty, but will see other types of animals. <br>  *Like mine is a small animal clinic-we don't see horses/livestock/birds, we mainly are cats and dogs-however we have a few clients that bring in ferrets, hamsters, rats, etc.<br>  Large animal clinics-that see horses, cows, etc. do often see dogs and cats-however they are more of the working dogs or barn cats, rather than family pets.|`|R3glUmwHaa	If you work for an equine vet, you'll probably get only horses.  But, if you work for a general large animal vet or a mixed animal vet you will get other types of animals.
KeevlZnTaa	Just b/c there is no discharge from the eyes, or nose does not mean she doesn't have a respiratory infection. I have had many rats that had not discharge, yet they had an infection. The discharge is simply an added warning sign that illness is present, but not necessary.<br>  <br>  Wheezing is a sure sign that she has a severe respiratory infection and it is beginning to go into the lungs. The "raspy" breathing is also a sign of respiratory infection, and a serious one at that. <br>  <br>  If you are not going to take her to the vet tonight than try to make her comfortable until tomorrow and then take her. If you have a humidifier, you could put that in the room to try and help her breathing. Keep her calm a quiet, and don't allow her to be too active of excited. Pretty much just leave her alone.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you can take her to the vet tomorrow, as respiratory infection do not get better without antibiotics, and eventually go into the lungs(causing pneumonia), the breathing becomes more labored and eventually death occurs.|`|6W4ZWOetaa	It's true, she probably does have a respiratory infection.  I know that's not what you want to hear, because that's no fun and I know you don't want your rat to be sick, but it's probably the case. Good news is, if she's still pretty healthy you may have caught it early enough to get her treated so that she can thrive and become healthy again.<br>  <br>  Even though you can't take her to the vet tonight, you really should take her in the morning.  The vet will give you antibiotics to help her.<br>  <br>  As for now, one thing that helps is to take her into the bathroom and turn on the shower so that the room fills with steam.  Breathing the humidified air will help break up her phlegm a little bit and help her feel a little better.  I learned this trick from a rat breeder long ago, and I think it does help them breathe a little easier.  <br>  <br>  Also, give her a little bit of warm water with some honey mixed into it, just a little... let her lap it up from a dish or something like that.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and that your rattie feels better soon.|`|xB2wRYYBaa	it could still be a respitory infection even without distcharge, just keep her in cleanest inviroment and if she hasnt improved by morning take her to the vet.

F3FrZ7eAaa	You have so many possibilities! What are you looking for in a pet? Something easy to take care of? Big or small? Easy to handle?<br>  <br>  What about getting a snake? I have a Ball Python whom I love very dearly. His name is Ringo, and he will get about 4 feet as an adult, if not smaller than that. It sounds a lot bigger than it actually is though. Snakes are a lot easier to take care of in comparison to lizards. They eat once a week (are you okay with feeding mice, they can be frozen/thawed too?) and only poop/pee once a week. They don't make noise, don't require any special lighting either. I don't want to go greatly into details if you aren't interested in snakes though-- I will tell you if you want me to though! Some other good beginner snakes are: Milk snakes--beautiful!, corn snakes--so many different patterns, King snakes, some sand boas... Kenyan Sand Boas stay nice and small if that's what you like.<br>  <br>  What about frogs? I have a recent liking for White's Tree frogs, I just think they are so fat and cute, lol. Are you looking for another lizard? Everyone will agree that Leopard Geckos make great pets. Turtles do rule like the first girl said, but the problem is they need big encolsures as adults.

One of the hardiest chameleons is the Jackson chameleon. They require a tall (2-3 ft) enclosure. I had a 3 foot tall screen enclosure that worked great. They need a day and night heat lamp. The substrate I used was paper towel. I had a ficus plant in there that my chameleon spent all his time in. Make sure you wash the plant before putting in in the cage as to remove the possible chemical pesticides on the leaves. Also it will need a source of humidity like a humidifier, they make special ones for tropical reptiles. Chameleons won't drink out of a bowl, so you'll need to get a drip system, you can pick one up for about $10 at you local pet store. They eat crickets and other insects that I put in a shallow cup that was tied to a branch. At one point I even got him to take a cricket right out of my hand. They're fun to hold too, but not too often.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|Lp27eolgaa	try a small lizard that you can play with and dont have to worry about getting bitten|`|01nMRPHVaa	I highly suggest Leos.

I have had several of these and have had very few problems with them. They tend to be very calm and rarely bite unless they are provoked. They are also fairly slow moving snakes. We would often let ours sit out while we worked in the house and it would just curl up and hang out (although you should never leave a snake unattended). I would recommend buying one that is slightly older (i.e. not a hatchling) because they are much more likely to survive and to eat well. Don't buy a wild caught snake, they can be hard to tame and are much less likely to eat regularly. These snakes eat mostly mice (but some prefer birds) and only grow to be 4 or 5 feet long. Just remember that this is a long commitment, because these snakes can live to be 30 years old if cared for properly. <br>  <br>  Care Guide:<br>  <a href="http://www.kingsnake.com/ballpythonguide..." rel="nofollow">http://www.kingsnake.com/ballpythonguide...</a><br>  <br>  Corn Snakes (<a href="http://fohn.net/corn-snake-pictures-fact..." rel="nofollow">http://fohn.net/corn-snake-pictures-fact...</a><br>  These are good starter snakes because they are readily available and also stay fairly small. This also means they eat less food and require a smaller tank for proper care. These snakes are fairly calm and are generally very good eaters (in case you don't want to have to worry about tricking your snake into eating). They also can be kept in many environments, so they are less likely to get ill from an improper environment (but a responsible owner should try to keep them as comfortable as possible). <br>  <br>  Care Guide:<br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/cornsnake..." rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/cornsnake...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Milk Snakes (<a href="http://www.reptilesweb.com/images/storie..." rel="nofollow">http://www.reptilesweb.com/images/storie...</a><br>  These snakes are small and easy to maintain. They require a dry environment with little light, so you don't have to worry about keeping up the humidity or turning the lights on and off. They do just fine with alternative heating sources, but you will need some light if you're keeping live plants. Just remember that milk snakes are gifted escape artists, so you need to provide a very secure environment to keep them from wandering away.

A full grown reticulated python requires several people to be handled safely. Even if proper precautions are taken, there is little you could do to stop the snake if they decided to constrict. Plus, even if they don't usually bite, a bite from a snake that large is much harder to care for than one from a small snake. They also require very large enclosures and the food is generally quite pricey. <br>  <br>  Rainbow Boas, Emerald Tree Boas, Green Tree Pythons <br>  While these snakes do not get very large, they don't always have very good temperaments and could do a lot of biting depending on the snake. These snakes can also be very fast and hard to handle outside of their tank. <br>  <br>  These are just a few recommendations; you don't need to limit yourself. Just be sure to do as much research as you can on the snake you decide to get. Know before you buy what care they require and be sure you are able to provide it.|`|VmLZFN4Taa	Bearded dragon!

But it was a laser procedure and it was a painless operation and the cat felt absolutely nothing and never even new the difference except when he first tried to claw at something, then he moved on and he was fine.<br>  <br>  But here you go read this you might like this article like I did!<br>  <br>  declawing and its alternatives<br>  www.marvistavet.com/html/body_declawin...<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a list of myths off this page for those who dont want to go to the site:<br>  MYTHS AND RUMORS: WHAT PEOPLE HEAR ABOUT DECLAWING<br>  <br>  MYTH #1:   AFTER DECLAWING A CAT IS LIKELY TO BECOME FEARFUL OR EXPERIENCE BEHAVIOR CHANGES IMPAIRING AN AFFECTIONATE RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS OWNER<br>  <br>  Numerous scientific studies have been unable to document any behavior changes post-declaw. In fact, in one survey 70% of owners of declawed cats reported an improved relationship with their cat after the procedure.<br>  <br>  ..............................<br>  <br>  MYTH #2:   A DECLAWED CAT CANNOT CLIMB TREES<br>  <br>  Declawed cats are not as effective at climbing trees as cats with claws but declawing does not prevent tree climbing.<br>  <br>  ..............................<br>  <br>  MYTH #3:   A DECLAWED CAT CANNOT CATCH PREY<br>  <br>  Declawed cats are not as effective at catching prey as cats with claws but declawing does not prevent effective hunting.<br>  <br>  ..............................<br>  <br>  MYTH #4:   A DECLAWED CAT HAS LOST ITS ABILITY TO DEFEND ITSELF AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED OUTSIDE<br>  <br>  This one is actually true. Without claws a cat has indeed lost an important part of its defense system. The Mar Vista Animal Medical Center feels strongly that declawed cats should be housed indoors only.<br>  <br>  ..............................<br>  <br>  MYTH #5:   DECLAWED CATS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BITE SINCE THEY CAN NO LONGER CLAW<br>  <br>  Declawed cats do not seem to realize they have no claws. They will continue to scratch ineffectively as if they did not know the difference.  Studies have shown no increased biting tendency after declawing.<br>  <br>  ..............................<br>  <br>  MYTH #6:   THE POST-OPERATIVE PERIOD INVOLVES TREMENDOUS PAIN<br>  <br>  The declawed cat will indeed have sore feet after surgery. The larger the cat, the more the discomfort and reluctance to bear weight. Pain relievers are often prescribed. However, this recovery period should not last longer than a week or so. Healing should be complete by two weeks.<br>  <br>  ..............................<br>  <br>  MYTH #7:   A DECLAWED CAT WILL NOT USE A LITTER BOX AGAIN<br>  <br>  It is very important that litter not get impacted in the declaw incisions during the recovery period. Shredded paper is the usual recommendation during recovery and some cats simply will not use shredded paper. The recycled newspaper litters are an excellent alternative.  The only litter problem one might expect would be lack of acceptance of a new litter during the recovery period. Declawed cats do not loose their litterbox instinct.|`|3MFplBN3aa	i have 3 cats, and dont declaw them. If they get outside they are as good as gone. They wont be able to defend themselfs.|`|0ti9MDIHaa	i have 2 kittens, we juyst cut there nails no nede to declaw, cut them they grow back cut again. not hard|`|o6BDapZjaa	If they removed only the claw, it could easily grow back.  They have to remove the first joint to get all the keratin-producing cells.  I had to have this done for my two cats; they were not adoptable (long story), and I finally decided that their losing a knuckle was preferable to being euthanized.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	No cat 'needs' to be declawed. There is never a reason to mutilate a cats feet. If you love your cat, you will not put them through this torture.<br>  <br>  They remove each toe up to the first joint/knuckle. The reason they do this, is because if they just remove the claw, it will grow back from the bone.<br>  <br>  It'd be like cutting our fingers off at the first knuckle. Declawing causes extreme pain to the cat and often problems down the line (litter box issues from associating the litter box with pain after surgery, personality changes/biting/and skittishness from having their first line of defense removed, arthritis from having to learn a new way of carrying their weight etc.). I hear people say all the time "better declawed than in a shelter", but in actuality many declawed cats end up in shelters anyway because of the behavioral problems many experience after being declawed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Did you know it's illegal and considered inhumane mutilation in most countries outside the U.S.? I've personally observed a declaw surgery at a vet and it's not a pretty sight to watch a vet take guillotine nail clippers and lop off parts of toes... very barbaric looking (laser removal has less healing time and pain, but really isn't that much better in the long run). Please don't put your furniture over your cat's well being, it's just selfish. Declawing has no benefits to the cat, only the owner. There are numerous alternatives including scratching posts and surfaces, sticky tape, deterrent sprays, Soft Paws nail caps, and nail trimming.

The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats that have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat that has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs its claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: <br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a>|`|uKpkOss0aa	You can look up information about declawing procedures and read information about what they do.  I did that and I will never declaw any cat I have in the future.  It is a terrible operation that no animal needs to go through and it is unnecessary.  <br>  <br>  There are many other options out there to declawing.  There are scratching posts and little caps you can ask your cat's veterinarian about that you put over the nails.  They are perfectly safe and do not hurt the cat's natural nails.<br>  <br>  If you want to know what euthanized means, look it up on Dictionary.com|`|JaFbuUUWaa	No cat NEEDS to be declawed, there are loads of other options. It is an extremely painful process and many clinics refuse to do it. And some cats will resort to biting without there claws. Get your cat a scratching post, and if need be soft paws, they are like rubbery artificial nails that go on your cats nails so it can not scratch. Much better than mutilating your cats toes. Please consider some of the other options!!|`|S6ie5HwBaa	Five Reasons Why Kitties Need Their Claws <br>  1.For protection. Honestly, we prefer to run away and not fight at all (unless someone is trespassing on our turf). But there are times when we just can't escape. Claws are our first line of defense, if the hissing and fluffed-out tail doesn't scare away our opponent. Plus, if we get outdoors (it can happen even to indoor cats) and we need to get away from a dog or another predator, we need our claws to climb trees skillfully. Clawless kitties have been attacked and killed because they couldn't make it up a tree fast enough.<br>  2.To mark our territory. Personally, I think this visual way of showing off our turf is a much nicer way of designating our territory than spraying. Plus, our paw pads leave a scent undetectable to you humans, but which any cat can recognize. That's why you sometimes see declawed cats "scratching" your furniture — they're still leaving their mark, only not as obviously since it's only scent and not visual. If you don't want us marking your furniture with our claws, you should get us a cat tree, or a scratching post with cat-approved surface. Our turf is important to us!<br>  3.For fitness. I keep on saying it over and over again, but I can't emphasize it enough: our claws are essential for our paw, front leg, shoulder and back health. We need to be able to dig into a surface and grab onto it so we can stretch our front legs and bodies. This helps us keep our long, lean look (I hear you humans do something called Pilates for the same reason). It also keeps us flexible far into old age. We need to stretch our toes too, and for that claws are necessary.<br>  4.To catch prey. You think that just because you feed us every day that we should not feel the need to catch things. That kind of thinking is totally ridiculous, and really very typical of human shortsightedness. For one thing, we cats are far more instinctual than you humans, and we have to be since we lack the highly sophisticated reasoning ability you people are supposed to have (but seem to so rarely utilize). Plus we need to keep in practice — what would happen if, one day, if we got out and couldn't get back home, or you keeled over and died or something and we had to fend for ourselves? A declawed cat can still catch prey, but nowhere near as well as we want to or may need to! Our hunting skills need to stay finely tuned. So even if our prey is only small bugs or just the cheap toy mice you get from the pet store, having our claws will help us keep in practice. And snatching something in midair with the hook of just one claw is so gratifying!<br>  5.So we can express ourselves. Most of the time you can tell what we're thinking by looking at how we've positioned our ears, and how we are moving our tails. But sometimes we really need to hammer a point home — say, with an unruly new kitten or an overly-friendly dog. Most of the time a good slap, with our claws in, will do the trick, but occasionally we need to flash just a touch of claw. Not enough to do any damage, mind you, but as a warning that there are lines that must not be crossed with us. We can handle our claws with the skill of an expert swordsman. Think Zorro with whiskers and pointy ears. If we knew the alphabet, I bet that most of us kitties could carve the most delicate, nearly invisible "C" on the back of your couch. Unless we are very frightened, cats know exactly how much claw to reveal. Declawed cats must resort to biting when they feel threatened, which is no fun for anyone<br>  <br>  Five Bad Things That Can Happen When a Cat Is Declawed <br>  1.We could have surgical or post-surgical complications. Since it is actually amputation, declawing is major surgery for a cat and there is a whole list of things that could possibly go wrong. Being under general anesthesia (the only way a cat is able to go through a declaw) always carries a risk of death. There is also the possibility of hemmorage. After surgery, our paws are wrapped in bandages, and it's not uncommon for us to rip them off, which hampers healing and could invite infection. Sometimes part of a claw grows back, and the cat has to have a second operation. Sometimes the surgery goes wrong and more of the paw has to be amputated. Don't think this is all that rare, or that it only happens at bad veterinary clinics. My human knows someone who works at a very high-end clinic that caters to movie stars' pets. The declawing of one Maine Coon went wrong, gangrene set in, and nearly half its foot had to be cut off. This cat is crippled and deformed for life.<br>  2.Your cat may stop using his litterbox. It's impossible to predict how painful a cat's paws are going to be after declawing. Of course, they will extremely painful while he is healing, and very, very sensitive to the sharp points of clay litter. That's why a veteranarian who declaws will tell the cat's human to use a paper-based litter such as Yesterday's News during the healing process. But sometimes a cat's paws are tender even after they heal, and he may never use the litterbox again. Humans who were upset that their cat was scratching their belongings will be even less thrilled when he begins peeing on them.<br>  3.A cat may undergo unpleasant personality changes. How would you feel if some big creatures knocked you out and when you woke up, you were in great pain and parts of your fingers were gone? So if you declaw your cat and afterwards she isn't the same cuddly creature she was before the operation, can you blame her? Sure some cats recover from the surgery and they act as if nothing (or almost nothing) happened. But there's no guarantee. A cat could also become fearful, defensive, unfriendly or angry. Maybe she'll become withdrawn and spend most of her time hiding. Your cat may never trust you again.<br>  4.Declawing causes longterm physical complications. The same way you need all your toes for walking, cats need those clawed joints to move naturally. In fact, cats need that part of their feet even more because they are far more physical creatures than humans are. Cats don't sit at a desk all day and just climb a few stairs now and again. They get around by leaping, jumping and reaching for whatever flat surface that they want to lie on. Declawing hampers a cat's ability to move in ways that aren't immediately obvious to human eyes, but over months and years it can cause them to develop arthritis and crippling structural changes. In addition, the joints of the declawed paws may become painfully contracted — permanently. A cat's inability to stretch properly will cause stiffness over the years, causing him to age prematurely. Declawing is very bad for a cat's longterm health.<br>  5.Declawed cats must never be allowed out of doors, and are in great danger if they do get out. A cat without claws cannot defend itself against predators such as dogs and coyotes, and has trouble climbing trees to escape them. And there are not just animal predators around, either. Members of dog fighting rings love to find declawed cats to use as bait — they're far less messy to capture and use than clawed cats. Bunchers (evil humans who acquire animals for labs) also love them since they're easier to handle than clawed cats. A lot of humans say they have no intention of letting their cats get outside, but accidents and disasters happen and you never know when you'll find an open door or hole in a window screen and your cat missing. A cat should have all she needs to defend herself — or escape — in case of such an emergency.<br>  <br>  Soft paws-Believe they come with instruction, however a vet can help you put them on if neccessary<br>  <a href="http://www.softpaws.com/instructions.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.softpaws.com/instructions.htm...</a>
FVD1tpLeaa	I know that Innova and wellness can be pretty expensive, but I still wouldn't go with Purnia One.  I'd say stick to something in the middle, like Blue Buffalo Wilderness (nice because it's high protien, lo carb).  Not as expensive, but it's still pretty good in it's own right.   Cats are primarily carnivores, and can't handle carb fillers as well as dogs can.<br>  <br>  I feed that with Wellness wet from time to time.  I don't mix them together though.  I like feeding wet food sometimes only because cats don't have the same thirst drive that dogs do, and have a tendency to not drink enough, and can become prone to kidney problems.  So if you're only going to feed dry, and your cat doesn't drink quite so much, i'd suggest getting one of those bubbling water bowls to attract her to drink more.

That said, Wellness and Innova are top notch.  Another really top grade food that's a bit cheaper than those is Taste of the Wild.  Foods like Purina, Science Diet, Royal Canin, and Iams are crap foods hiding behind a big name.  They all contain grain fillers which contribute nothing towards your cat's nutritional needs and by-products which are very low-quality proteins.  TOTW, Wellness Core, and Innova are made with top quality ingredients and no grains so they are much better for your cat.  I implore you to read this article on why cats need to eat wet food. If not for every meal, for most. I wish I had known this information years ago.

If you have one cat, you're talking under $10 a week for food.  And I do know your pain.  I have 8 cats and have to struggle to feed Wellness wet so I don't end up with more sick ones.

My kitty ended up with bloody diarrhea and had to have antibiotics for a week.  I switched to Iams brand and no more problems . It does cost like $8-$10 for smallest size bag-but kitty's health is worth it!|`|EOAGsTLqaa	Iams and Purina are the best cat foods. I feed my cat wet food every once in a while and he is happy and healthy. I would really recommend Iams though, but if you are really on a budget get Purina. Store Brand is not bad either!|`|CvsrmBn6aa	1. Blue Buffalo brands (esp. Wilderness)-exp.<br>  2. Science Diet brands- cheaper than BB, but still exp.<br>  3. Iams-cheaper than SD<br>  4. Purina ONE-realtively chap|`|e1bc9ee12a586a97194ed85c52656355aa	Apparently people don't read the whole question. <br>  I have 5 indoor cats that i have fed top line holistic foods, cheap food, and tried the all wet food diet. <br>  I feed my cats Friskies Feline Favorites, it's the purple bag. All my cats range in age, from 2 years old to 11 years old. They all like it, they are all in perfect weight and health, and don't get sick on it, don't have urine problems, etc. Now, tiz true every cat IS different, but I really believe that Friskies is a good affordable brand. I buy the HUGE bag of food for around 15 dollars. That lasts me a month. <br>  -Feeding the the holistic foods, was wonderfful. Their skin did improve, they stopped shedding as much, and things like that. But after awhile, all those rich nutrients cause build ups, and stool turns to either a river or a rock. <br>  -The wet food diet.. awesome. However, your cats turn into starving beggers who never leave your feet. They are constantly needy. They begin to love you for food, and nothing more. <br>  So, there's my story.. now go get some Friskies! LOL!!|`|srjPOxW7aa	this stuff is the best. I have several cats and all of them love this stuff, it's healthy it's inexpensive and apparently it's tasty because even my pickiest cats eat it up!<br>   note: have a old cat that had gotten sick with badder crystal build up when he was 14 yrs. old, he had to be on an expensive diet for weeks to get rid of them. In fear those crystals will return, I have to feed my cat right, this food has served him well for years , he's 17 yrs. old now. I highly recommend this food

szzoxJRBaa	i work at an agway pet store, and we do sell the pacman frogs but the prices vary,  the green or a normal pacman will go for about 20 - 30 dollars. the albinos usually sell at 50-55 dollars. if you do go to a reptile expo you can find them from anywhere from 10 - 40 dollars.  if you go to www.kingsnake.com you can find a list of expos, with locations and dates. i found a green pacman at an expo for 15 dollars. they are the coolest frogs! hope you find one!<br>  <br>  i'm sorry i didnt realize you were looking for set up prices as well: they only need a 10 gal tank, those run on average about 12 dollars, screen lid which are about 8 dollars.  Jungle bedding is what i use for mine, and a small bag of that is about 7 dollars. then they just need heat, i just use an undertank heater which will run about 20 dollars.  then they just need food, lots of it they are pigs! crickets at agway usually run 1.38 per dozen. so set up is around 57 dollars, plus whatever you pay for your frog.<br>  <br>  i have live plants in my tank, but you could use plastic. i've read that they will uproot live plants when they try to burrow, but mine is still a baby and hasnt done so yet... i also have a shallow water dish, along with a small hide that he likes to burrow through|`|wLgGD63raa	For everything I would say probably around $100. <br>  <br>  You can start your juvenile from out in a 10 gallon but you are eventually going to need to switch over to something bigger, at least a 20 gallon.  If these frogs are kept in small tanks it can stress them out. They are hardy animals but you still have to do what is best for them. A 20 gallon will probably cost you around $30. You can always find cheap used ones on sites like Craigslist or Kijiji.<br>  <br>  You are also going to need a UTH (under tank heater) for your frog. These frogs do not absolutely need any special lighting such as UVB so a UTH will work just fine. One for a 20 gallon will probably cost you about $10-15.<br>  <br>  For substrate I would suggest using coconut fiber. A block of it will probably cost you around $7, you can get them at most pet shops. I know Petco and PetsMart carry them. <br>  <br>  You'll also need a water dish, one that is large enough for your frog to fit in. Shouldn't cost more than $7-10. As well as a water dish you'll need somewhere for your frog to hide if it is feeling uncomfortable. The price really depends on what kind you get and how big it is.<br>  <br>  You will also need a hydrometer and thermometer to measure humidity and temperature. Both of these shouldn't cost more than $20.<br>  <br>  Depending on where you can get your frog it'll probably cost you anywhere from $20-50<br>  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that these are just the basic things that you need. You can add a lot more to your tank for looks and comfort of your frog. There are many wonderful forums out there and I suggest that you consider reading up on some of them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vivariumforum.com/community/frogs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vivariumforum.com/community/f...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.reptilerooms.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptilerooms.com</a>|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	At a petstore like Petsmart or Petco, you're looking at between 30-50 dollars. You're best off finding one at an expo or buying from a breeder.
AEsjkj0uaa	Don't touch the kittens. Cats are instinctive. They know how to give birth, they know how to clean up and care for the kittens. Mom cats are VERY protective of their babies, so do not touch them unless you notice the mom cat is not taking care of one. In that case, take the one that is not being fed to the vet, and you may have to hand feed it.|`|PCZOdRU1aa	you should try and get her to the vet and see wat they can do before its to late.

eDySIDPQaa	1---police are not required to hold a dog for 24 hrs after finding the dog...if they did, they would have to move the humans out of the cells and fill them with the poor dogs found,.<br>  <br>  2---if she called and notified the police and described the dog, then yes, they could have called her and let her pickup the dog from them..this really should have been done.<br>  <br>  3--the first call should have been to the Humane Society to get it on record, and describe the dog, and let them know, his collar broke off when he ran out of the door...this way, they would have known it was her dog when the police left him with them and they would have called her upon his arrival.<br>  <br>  4--them being rude to her like they were, she can file a compalint with her local city councilman, and they will check on it.<br>  <br>  5--the 80.00 is high,but unfortunately, some charge really high for you to get your dog back...ours charges 50.00..<br>  <br>  6--the threat of picking up her dog due to no shots is legitimate, but they cannot legally put the dog down like that..they have to inform you, they are giving the shots and you will have to pay for them, they are so wrong for saying that....<br>  <br>  I am really sorry for your aunt's encounter with Humane Society staff that does not seem to care about animals at all...wish people like that would not be allowed to work around animals.....<br>  <br>  hope your aunt is okay now.<br>  <br>  I do commend you all on the great search you all did....and sure she is very happy to have her baby back home safe..|`|pc7ZjexJaa	thats insane<br>  <br>  wow. <br>  and scary. <br>  <br>  I would have flipped a **** on them|`|FdcWPp48aa	You say the police are supposed to keep it over night.  Where would they do such a thing?  $80 is a bit high, but a small price I'm sure when it got your Aunt's dog back to her.  The staff at the Humane Society should be ashamed to have acted so rudely, but that is really all I see that was really wrong here.  So glad you were able to get the dog back.|`|Qe04KxYoaa	No, on your Aunts part. She should have replaced the collar immediately and instead of the police she should have contacted the Humane Society.  The fact is that you are lucky to have gotten the dog back all in one piece, be grateful and next time have your Aunt be more careful. I understand accidents do happen and I would be more compassionate if the collar had broken when he escaped but he was done the day before, she had time to replace it. The fee was because she failed to control her dog, this was appropriate. As for their attitude they are tired of picking up dead dogs that have been hit by cars because they got lose. They probably, due to insurance, could not let your Aunt go into the back.|`|Hwybmzg5aa	sue them for everything they have got.|`|PM23RDycaa	Obviously the Police broke protocol for whatever reason, probably didn't want to be bothered and the people at the Humane society were rude and belligerent. Obviously your aunt was coming to get the dog there was NO reason to say they would hold him for five days. All they should have done was tell her of the dog's condition and that they had him put aside for her.<br>  <br>  The impound fee shouldn't have been taken because the police dropped him off without holding him overnight, but whats done is done. <br>  <br>  Glad to hear she got him back in one piece, don't let the incident sour you.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Yeah they definitely should have been ashamed of themselves. $80 for that short of time is way to much. And really they have no right to say they can reclaim that dog.
wjwsFPMuaa	She may be stressed out the first few weeks...especially given her past. Luckily she feels secure around your mom so that will help her out a lot. When I left for college my cat was PISSED at me...The first weekend I came home he cussed me out the entire time! But he eventually realized that I was coming back every week to see him and got used to the idea.|`|fgxajTiBaa	She might get stressed out when you leave, but as soon as she learns the routine, she'll be more okay with it.<br>  <br>  Of course she'll remember you, my parents dog remembers me after months of not seeing me<br>  <br>  As for the last two questions? When you leave your mom will become the pack leader. She will be the one who is feeding and taking care of her. Dogs don't see 'ownership' they see leadership. Don't be offended if you start to see a gradual shift in the dog being more loyal to your mom. It says nothing about you or your love for your dog, it's normal dog mentality.|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	yes or no she might or might not think you left her. she could think you left her or she could think that you were kidnapped, it depends if she saw you leave or not<br>  <br>  for questions 2-4 its all yes. yes, she will remember you, dogs have great memories. thats how they learn tricks. yes she will listen to you and follow you if thats what she has been doing so far. and yes she will remember that you own her, she'd probably feel a little lonely when you're gone if your her main caretaker.<br>  <br>  and you should feel like you're leaving her because you are. you're leaving her with your parents. leaving your dog isnt necessarily a bad thing. your dog would have more time outside with your parents (right?) and benifit having more exercising oppertunities than her being with you in college. she's in better hands at your house.<br>  <br>  she will remember you, you shouldnt feel bad. you're going to see her every week, right? its impossible that she'd forget you and if she was a little depressed that you're gone then she's be even more happy to see you when you come back.<br>  <br>  yes its the right thing to do, if you're wondering in your head. she will still love you the same when you come back, or maybe even more since she misses you. just be happy when you see her, she'd be happy too|`|hTgnvLOSaa	1.

When dogs are anxious because of separation anxiety they may become destructive like mine did when i went to florida for two weeks. tell your mom to keep a close eye on her. to her, her pack leader is leaving her and she may be really sad for a while. but she'll be ok|`|mbjqbtgVaa	All of your questions could be better answered if you could describe some things about your dog and what her typical behavior is:  <br>  1.

Is she clingy with you?  In other words, does she follow you     constantly around the house?<br>  5. Who walks her daily?|`|gpVSRFuOaa	Unfortunately, her past has scarred her so yes, she will feel some sort of abondonment. She may think you are just like her previous owner. Think about it, Animals are just like us. If you were abused and left in the past, wouldnt you feel very upset too? But yes, they wont understand what it is like to be totally loved and wanted. They misunderstand, so make sure she understands that you care. She will remember, know and listen to you.:)|`|701e58df5467ec4c3e55497b3558ae74aa	1.

Just make sure when you're home you spend a lot of time with her.|`|kceGobAXaa	well, yes she will think you are leaving her, at first.  but dogs can fall into a routine very quickly.  once she sees that you come back every weekend, she will just think this is the way it is and will be just as happy.|`|3d4XE1Keaa	First thing's first..... calm down.  :)  It won't be as bad as you think.<br>  <br>  I went on vacation for 2 weeks and left my dogs at the vet where I work.  I came back and picked my dogs up and as soon as they saw me they freaked out and started jumping up and down and everything was fine.  <br>  <br>  Dogs really don't have the same concept of time that we do.  We know how much time is passing, they really don't.  <br>  <br>  She won't think you're leaving her.  Just DON'T make a big deal out of your arrivals and departures or else she may START having a problem with it because she'll be like "Oh no....she's gonna go away again....."  Its the same with dogs with separation anxiety problems.  If you just leave without making it a big deal, she won't have anxiety about it.  If you come back home without making it a big deal, it will probably feel more normal for her.<br>  <br>  Just make sure while you're gone, your family keeps things as normal as possible for her.  Everything should be just fine.  If you're still worried, you could leave behind some unwashed clothes or something else with your scent on it so she's sure to remember you when you come home.
veDvtYhJaa	Well, Noromectin is a form of Ivermectin.  Personally I prefer to buy Ivomec, Plain (NOT the plus) or generic plain Ivermectin.  Ivomec for cattle has in it Ivermectin which is the exact same medicine as is used to make Heartguard which is so much more expensive.  <br>  <br>  Two of my dogs are pyrs, close to 100#, so I give them 1cc of Ivermectin, plain each month.  I also give it to my Aussie cross, because I didn't realize he was a "collie breed".  Luckily, he doesn't have the MDR1 gene, so he's safe.  There is a test you can do to see if the dog is genetically pre-disposed to die from Ivermectin, but on your current budget, I figure that's hard to do.  <br>  <br>  The Ivermectin I get (I discussed all this with merial who makes Heartguard) is an injectible, BUT I don't need to inject it.  I squirt it on their breakfast once a month.  For 3 dogs, a bottle will last me more than one year, and that makes the monthly treatment for my dogs against heartworm very low cost, as the 50cc bottle lasts so long and only costs about $30.   My Aussie is 58# and so I only give him 1/2cc. -!-|`|uTIgyCCHaa	If there are SO many people you know that use this, you might want to ask one of them.  But again, I don't think that this product is made for use in dogs.  I already answered this once.|`|LazxXqXjaa	Ah yes, it's been used for many years in dogs.  And it's also been causing anaphylactic shock, seizures, and death in those same dogs for years.  It's shoddy medicine by any standard.   <br>  <br>  Ask your vet if he/she will give you a price break if you order Heartgard in large quantities.  Generic forms, like Iverhart, are somewhat less expensive but still formulated in the microgram dosage for dogs.
FVD1tpLeaa	he's resource guarding.  You should get in touch with an experienced trainer and take care of it not, because it will only get worse as he gets older.|`|4ocbHgm0aa	This is a very common problem with many dogs, especially toy breeds. It is usually caused bu the dog not considering you the "alpha" but rather himself. You need to teach him that you are alpha, you own the toy, and it is a privelage for him to be allowed to have your toy. To show that you own the toy, you just need to do a simple excercise. Place the toy on the floor, when he goes towards it, put your foot on it and say leave it. He will dig around your foot and try to get and maybe even pitch a fit. Once he has calmed down (preferably sat) give him a treat and say "good leave it". Then pick the toy up and give it to him. After repeating this excercise this may solve your problem because he realizes it's yours. If it doesn't and you need to get it away, get a treat and ask him to give, when he eventually does reward him with lots of treats. He will realize when he releases the toy to you he will get lots of rewards. These excercies should work, if not, you occassionally do see a dog with a pyschological problem that causes them to do this. In that case, you should consult a trainer, and they can teach how to help him.<br>  <br>  Also, to help him learn you are the "alpha" have him sit before he gets his food. Or don't allow him to jump on the couch when he pleases, but invite him when you want him there. Simple things like that will help his overall behavior.|`|mc59Y5vwaa	I would suggest that you not focus on this particular issue as much as the bigger problem that your dog thinks it is the boss.  You need to adjust your lifestyle to reflect to the dog that you are leader of the pack and then it will willingly give things up to you.<br>  <br>  You should walk first, eat first, the dog should obey before getting any kind of attention.  The dog does not pick where it sleeps, etc.  This may sound cruel, but you just need to establish yourself and you will both benefit from a more healthy relationship.|`|TPWs85H1aa	Use your shoed foot to step down on the toy. He will attack your foot, but hold your ground (the shoe should protect you form the nursing teeth). When you see him calm down (sit lay down walk away) give him back the toy. Repeat till he gets that you are the boss. He should cave and get to the point where he always lets you take things from him. If you mix his food with your hands and feed it to him he will also understand that you are in charge of food and will let you be the boss.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|BDRIeLqUaa	you and your pet need training classes- best way to have a healthy 4 legged member of your family and you safe|`|dmNN2qO0aa	Hey,<br>  <br>  You are on the right track making a loud noise to stop the puppy biting/growling. <br>  <br>  The way I deal with puppies that growl or bite is to do the following:<br>  <br>  First I “yelp” and walk away…after your dog first bites or growls at you, make a yelping sound and walk. Refuse to pay any attention to your dog for 15 minutes or so. After this amount of time, return to the pup and make up. <br>  Next I use a strategy you are already using – I make a loud noise using a can with a few small stones of pennies in it. When your puppy growls or bites you, give the can a good shake and drop it next to your puppy. As you do this say “Stop”. If he does stop then you can praise him and even give him a treat. <br>  If the first two things don’t work, I physically discipline the dog (not hard though). To do this, grab the puppy by the loose skin around the back of the neck and say “No Bite” (or something similar). Don’t pull the puppy, the idea is just to show him that you will not accept this behavior. Release the puppy and don’t give him any attention for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes go and make up with the puppy again.<br>  This is what I do and it works well for me – I hope it works for you too!<br>  I have included a couple of links below where you can find more information about how to overcome these types of problems.<br>  Good luck,<br>  Craig Clemins|`|ptuApC2Eaa	when he bites u make him bite his own tonungue after he just bit u but not to hard

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Kittens who were taken from their mothers too soon often has issues with clawing and biting because their mother didn't have time to teach the kittens manners.  Make sure you never let the kitten play with your hands or feet. That just fuels the bad behavior.  <br>  <br>  When your kitten starts biting or scratching, get up and walk away.  He will learn his bad behavior makes playtime end and he'll stop.  If your kitten is biting when you hold him, put him down.  Kittens are balls of energy and are way too busy to be held.  Scratching and biting are his way of saying "put me down".  Try playing with him with a feather on a stick toy instead of holding him.  <br>  <br>  Make sure he has a good scratch post.  A good tall cat tree would be even better.  Cats have a natural instinct to scratch and must be allowed to -appropriately.  <br>  <br>  Have him neutered as soon as your vet will do it.  Some want to wait till 6 months old but it's perfectly safe to have it done as soon as the kitten weighs 2 pounds if he's otherwise healthy.|`|UETAqR8Taa	make sure there are lots of toys to chew and chase. a scratching post is a must preferably on they can jump around on. look at the ones at deals direct (for a good price)<br>  walk away when rough play starts and watch how near you get your face - kittens are quick|`|d6bUhFnjaa	get or make a scratching post and cat toys my cat has a catnip toy and she plays with that instead of my hand|`|6MMqbzs2aa	well when he does scratch and bite, you have to pick him up by the scruff of the neck. Its natural, and it doesn't hurt. That's how his mother would pick him up if he were wandering too far or being naughty. <br>  The scruff is just the skin on his neck, just under the base of his skull. Make sure you don't pull the tendons. <br>  When you pick him up, he'll curl up. Don't worry, that's natural. Hold him up to your face, look him in the eye and say 'no' rather strongly. Don't yell, you'll freak him out, but just be firm. Then put him down and leave him alone for a while. Do this every time he starts getting too hyper and starts really scratching and biting. Not just play-biting and scratching, but like full violent about it. <br>  Also, you should encourage him to go outside, or otherwise he'll be scared all his life. Just maybe put him on a kitten harness and take him out for ten minutes a day and let him get used to it, but make sure you stay with him all the time, holding on to one end of the harness.<br>  <br>  Hope this works :]|`|0ti9MDIHaa	i just got 2 2month old kittens about 4weeks ago, they are very small and they are like babys, their outgoing but sometimes they bite and scratch just bevcause there young and dont know better, is your kitten shy or playful, also its good to get 2 at once because it needs  a"friend" to socialize wiht, well thats what the adoption place told me.|`|lFdWmDjGaa	You should definitely get him neutered, this usually calms animals down and make them less aggresive.

gjD8pndjaa	No, I've only been bitten by large dogs, but I'd agree that there is a disproportionate lack of obedience training among smaller dogs than larger ones.<br>  <br>  <br>  However, I'd like to say that what POs me beyond anything else is when the people against BSL turn it around and say "small dogs are the vicious ones" or "little dogs are more likely to attack" not Pits.<br>  <br>  That hypocrisy makes me want to punch someone in the face -_-<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Oh, you are totally entitled to that opinion, I'm sure you're not alone with that sentiment.  Thats not what bugs me.  What bugs me is when people like you are against breed specific targeting only when it applies to Pits, Dobes, Rotties, etc.  Then when it comes to those "vicious" small dogs, fire away!|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I have been bitten by large dogs, but the worst bite I ever got was from a chihuahua.  I found him as a stray, and he eventually became a really good dog, but not without some major battles.<br>  <br>  I think you are dealing with a combination of things.  Small dogs are harder to keep in, because they can squeeze through such small spaces (I have a yard within a yard for mine.)<br>  <br>  All the dogs you mentioned were bred to hunt vermin, and tend to be very independent.  They require a strong owner, and apparently didnt have one.<br>  <br>  Some people who have small dogs give them way too much leeway because of their size. They think they cannot hurt anyone, which is not true. <br>  <br>  I am fostering a chihuahua right now who had a number of behavioral issues when she came to me, because her former owner treated her like a dolly, rather than a dog.  I treat my small dogs the same way I treat my big dogs, and they are well behaved.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	I haven't personally. But my dog has been attacked by a Jack Russell Terrier. Poor Brasky...he's SUCH a good dog and I've trained him so well that he just laid there and cringed while the JRT had ahold of his head. I guess thats one of the consequences of conscientious training. It was over quickly and if that dog even so much as LOOKS at Brasky wrong these days...Brasky just wants to rip him to pieces. Otherwise he LOVES to run and play with other dogs. I'm surprised to this day that he gave the JRT a free pass. I guess he knew that with the JRT being only 14 pounds and himself being 100 pounds it wouldn't be a fair fight...but that was the LAST free pass that dog ever got!|`|zfrPmiFtaa	I haven't been attacked...well, unless you count a miniature schnauzer that's YOUR dog chasing and grabbing onto your jeans being attacked. She was a good dog though, and I was running around yelling trying to get her to do something...she thought it was a game.<br>  Anyway, it doesn't bother me that much, but it bothers you probably because you have such bad luck with little dogs.<br>  <br>  And as for the thing about most little dogs not being trained, it is VERY hard to get a yorkie to sit. My little pal dances and high fives, but I can't get him to sit. You did make me laugh with that though!|`|AA10232348	Hi. I have recently noticed that you are into animals, is that true?|`|q1cxmThHaa	I've never been attacked by  a little dog, but I know what you mean.<br>  I have a shih tzu, who is an angel but I know some people with small dogs and they think its funny when they bite people or growl (and I suppose it might be funny LOOKING and I know the dogs aren't likely to do much harm), but it's still not cool.<br>  <br>  All dogs need to be treated the same when it comes to etiquette. <br>  The few times my 15 lb girl has growled at a friend she gets a firm NO!  and that's the end of it.|`|s5Dy3RQyaa	I think you and I would get along real well!  lol.  I love big dogs!  Little dogs if they are not trained well, will bite because of their size.  They know they are small and find the need to strike first!  Big dogs will always warn you before they bite!  I think owners think they are harmless and will not or can not hurt anyone!  I think it is a shame!  But remember, it isn't the dogs fault, it is the owners fault!|`|PM23RDycaa	Yeah it bothers me. The dog bite/incident report from last year tallied ALL breeds small to big. Dachshunds were at the top of the list. The problem with all the breeds that have attacked you is they weren't bred to be lap dogs. They are working small breeds with prey drive, hard heads and tenacity. Unfortunately as you have seen their owners treat them like babies and foo-foo dogs. They dismiss the nipping and the barking etc with "oh its so cute" or "they're just playing" My ***. Its the simple fact that they are small and can't do "real harm" yeah to an adult maybe, a small child is a different story.<br>  <br>  Blood drawn twice by a small dog. The other incidents have been grazes and torn clothing. <br>  <br>  whats worse are the owners who's lil dogs go after LARGER dogs and then go on about how the other dog is antagonizing their "poor sweet innocent baby" < overheard in Petco|`|p7swtBYzaa	You have a valid point,of course, little dogs have no more right to behave badly than big ones and their owners certainly have a responsibility to socialize and train them.<br>  <br>  I have 6 small dogs (dachshunds) and I have worked to socialize them.   Several are rescues who came to me very scared and unsocialized - takes work and patience to change that, but that's what I do.   I also have had many fosters and one of the things I do is to socialize them so that they can be adopted - they need to be well behaved and trust people before they go to their permanent homes.<br>  Biters are NOT adoptable - rescues don't adopt them out, neither do shelters, until they are cured of that.<br>  <br>  That said, when a small dog attacks you, you end up with ripped jeans or maybe a little bite - when big dogs attack, it can be life threatening - or worse.   That's the reason you don't read about the small dog attacks much, they aren't very damaging and never heard of a chihuahua killing anyone - have you?<br>  <br>  So, the answer to your question is - yes, it bothers me when small dogs behave badly and their owners don't train or socialize them, but it is a lot worse when big dogs do this - you can end up maimed or dead.   The reality of it is that big dogs are more dangerous when they attack, there's no way around that.
1WmDOPGtaa	It would never happen.  Someone who makes that much money for training sessions isn't going to give it away for free in this sort of forum.<br>  <br>  Besides, I like seeing what average owners think.  Okay, to be honest I don't always like it... but it can be informative.|`|PM23RDycaa	Not really and its about as likely as Cesar making an account. Secondly there were be absolutely NO way to prove its actually her so what would be the point?|`|bIaywrBCaa	I am not that crazy about her altho I do enjoy watching the shows, just don't agree with her a lot. Besides she is not going to give out free advice on YA when she can be making so much money with her TV show.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	I used to really like her but what people need to know is that there are different training methods required for different dogs. No dog is alike and not every dog will respond the same way to the same training exercises over and over. <br>  <br>  For example: <br>  <br>  A working GSD has a hard drive and usually a harder temperament..they need harsher training methods...not cruel but definitely much firmer..and 9 times out of 10 those dogs will NOT respond to positive reinforcement training.<br>  <br>  On the opposite end of the spectrum a small dog that has a very soft temperament and is very submissive will respond very well to positive reinforcement training.<br>  <br>  Then there are the ones in the middle who will respond to both in given increments. Every dog owner that takes on the task of training needs to find the right "balance" so to speak when it comes to training. They need to learn to work with the dog, forge a bond, and know how to make the dog tick to get the utmost out of the dog's training.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Honestly, no ... her method of training is aimed at having a livable pet.

zqVDJxUIaa	You are doing the right thing when it comes to water changes. You can add a biological supplement (such as Hagen's Cycle, or Bio-Spira). It will introduce nitrifying bacteria to help you finish the cycling process faster. You will also need to vacuum the gravel, to remove decomposing waste, which are the main cause of toxin buildup. Keep in mind that tanks vary greatly on cycling time, some can even take up to 3 months to FULLY mature. Be patient, and don't add any more fish until the cycle is completely done. For more cycling information:<br>  <a href="http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cyclin...</a><br>  <br>  Keep doing those water changes to reduce the concentration of nitrites and nitrates. Nitrates are not too much of a problem; they are only harmful when in high concentrations. You can also use a nitrite remover chemical (available at your local fish store), but I wouldn't recommend it unless your nitrite levels rise.<br>  <br>  Yes, nitrites usually go down when nitrate levels rise, because the nitrifying bacteria are catching up slowly to the new chemical.<br>  However, it takes time for nitrite levels to drop, usually a week or so when nitrates start to rise.<br>  <br>  Having live plants will also reduce Nitrite/Nitrate, and will also oxygenate the water.<br>  <br>  What you are doing is perfect... the only thing missing is a tiny bit of extra patience. (I know, it's hard)<br>  <br>  Good Luck, and happy Fishkeeping!|`|1YNhKzeqaa	Your little fishes are at risk for nitrite poisoning! But don't worry, there are steps you can take to help your little guys out :)<br>  When fish suffer from nitrite poisoning, their blood can't carry oxygen like its supposed to, so basically they can suffocate even though your water is oxygenated.<br>  <br>  What can you do?<br>  <br>  1. Reduce feedings. Food -> Ammonia -> Nitrite<br>  Less food = less ammonia = less nitrite<br>  2. Add aquarium salt, not marine salt. High nitrite levels are detrimental to your little fishes immune systems, and salt helps ward off disease.<br>  3. Do a large water change. It helps to drop the levels of nitrite.<br>  4. Aerate the water even more. Gas exchange happens at the water's surface, and surface disturbances help immensely. Raise your filter a little bit to increase surface disturbances.|`|33oAfqGnaa	leave it alone for one week if there is no fish in it<br>  if there is a fish in your tank then do a 3 gallon water change once a week or a 2 gallon water change every two days.|`|6yoCcGBWaa	Stop changing the water so frequently.  Do you currently have fish in your tank or are you doing a fishless cycle?  Ideally, you are doing a fishless cycle and you shouldn't be doing any water changes.<br>  <br>  If you do have fish in the tank, back off your water changes to maybe 1 gallon a week, if any.  Your nitrites will drop as your nitrates rise.

Just remember that a ferret has no homing insting like a dog or cat and can easily become lost, ferret feet are sensitive and don't let them walk on hot sidewalks or sand.<br>  <br>  good luck!!<br>  Ferrets Rule.|`|f3pu5FAFaa	my lil fuzzies ( i had five) use to sit here and not play with the toys i use to get them from the pet store. So i ended up just letting them play my my old baby toy ( they loved it ) my whitey  use to love actual toy cars and stole them on my son  , they use to love squeaky toys ( like bath rubbery toys ) , just try out a bunch of stuff like paper bags  and tunneling stuff. they also loved cardboard boxes. I dunno what  yours are all like but deffently just try a bunch of new stuff. i really wish that i was able to bring my babies when we were shipped out  to wa, but post doesn't allow them . :(   also just try searching the web , i did a few times.)|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	For my three, I've found that their favorite toys (much to my chagrin) are boxes, pickle jars, and baby toys (primarily hard little balls to shove around, rattles, and a little kiddie piano to walk on and make noise) and the top most entertaining toy for my guys--throwing close on top of them and then wrestling and dragging them along on shirt or pants.  Though, they do love their Flexi Fun-nels and play cubes (giant red pop-up cubes that I got at Wal-Mart).  <br>  They destroyed must of the store-bought 'ferret' toys and didn't play with the others, so I generally stay away from those, now.
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	To contain odors, clean the cage and litter box and play area every day with a good enzymatic cleaner (Zer-Odor, Nature's Miracle, etc),wash ferret laundry weekly, and bathe infrequently (a few times a year).  Also, food is important.  You need to feed a raw/natural diet, or a premium ferret kibble.  Here's a chart:  <a href="http://www.mdferretpaws.org/care_treats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mdferretpaws.org/care_treats....</a><br>  <br>  If you do that, the smell is barely noticeable.  My ferrets are in my bedroom, and I have plexi-glass installed so I can keep the door open.  You can't even smell the ferrets (no one knows I have them until I tell them I do--and we have a VERY open floor plan).<br>  <br>  Remember, what most people associate with ferrets is the odor of their pee and poo.  Any animal's feces and urine will smell.  A dog's does, but no one cares since most dogs go outside.  Imagine a lab defecating in the house every time they had to go.  It would smell.  A ferret kept indoors has no choice but to relieve itself in its litterbox in the house.  If you keep that clean, feed a food that the ferret's body can breakdown and use (so that they don't have to eat as much, therefore going to the bathroom less) then you've taken away the major drawback of ferrets.  Then, if you don't overbathe, their bodies aren't forced to overproduce oils, so they only have a mild smell (it varies from ferret to ferret.  My youngest two tend to smell like vanilla and cinnamon, whereas my older girl has a more typical ferret musk).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|fzaf5t3Caa	here is your answer =] : ferrets do smell i will not lie to you about that. Their body smells musky, and their poop smells really bad. If you kept the ferret in your room though, it wouldn't be a big deal to anybody else. i know your probably thinking how am i going to sleep with that smell but don't worry, you ge used to the smell after a week or so and you won't quite notice. <br>           Ferrets are great pets by the way !! they are like little 4 year olds. They explore anything and everything. And, they love love love to chase things, hide, hide things, they are really fun to watch if you ask me =] Also, they can be litter trained to keep the poop confined to one area and that way cleaning is easier making smell not as bad . My mom was the same way at first. She did not want a ferret at all. But once I got him (his name is bailey [= ) she learned that it was my responsibility and that i would have to deal with the mess and smell myself and hey guess what...now I have two ferrets . They really are fun and adorable little critters. Warning: if you get a ferret you WILL fall in love heheh :] !!! Good luck and hopefully you can get one. Just tell your mom that you will clean the cage everyday ( and im sure you will if you really want one) and you will pay for the expenses ans what not.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Even descented ferrets still have an odor. Even though it isn't as strong it is still pretty noxious. And their poop smells worse than a cat's eating nothing but road kill. I've had to clean up after tons of them and it's all the same between male and female. There are special products out there to help with the smell, but they aren't very effective for long.|`|JaFbuUUWaa	They do smell, it's that simple.<br>  The smell is containable although if your ferret is descented, you clean it's cage often (and by often I mean like at least 2 times a week) and give your ferret a bath when needed. They are alot more work than some people think, so make a wise thought out decision :) I have one and I love her.... but she does stink sometimes.<br>  <br>  Add: Also keeping them on a good food helps. I have mine on Innova Evo and Totally Ferret, I mix them together and her poop smells 10 times less than when I had her on Marshalls/kaytee.|`|GIG0nLpVaa	Feed the ferrets snen, it makes them not smell as bad, no one really knows why but it really works!
GPfI4qUgaa	you probably just stunned her :) shel be ok, shes in my prayers lol|`|cc8Jl3Lwaa	Ook first of all check if she's stuck or not. This is a hamster's instinct to stay still till they know their safe, their doing this to hear their surroundings to see if everything is ok. If its not stuck and just staying there without blinking then put your hand in the cage with a treat such as a cracker a carrot, or sunflower seed and see if he.she comes out, if not then wait about 24 hours before interaction. Dont worry this has happened to me but worse. I startled mine and it became a mad man for a couple of days.... you'll get through this...|`|gpVSRFuOaa	She's fine. Just scared. Is the tube too small for her? How long has she been in there? New environment? Well whenever my hamster is near my dog, she freezes up for a long time until im completely a floor away from the dog, so its hust her instinct to freeze up so the "predator" Can't detect her, you know?:)|`|tdJ1wE7daa	Try to get your hamster out of it tube and find out if it can move or not.|`|t2JbU2Ayaa	GOOD JOB, DUDE!!!!|`|1KfbgBupaa	Were you holding your hamster or did you knock the cage over?  Doesn't a hamster have to move in order to get into the tube?  However, she could still be injured in some way (though I don't understand the mechanism) and you must take her to the vet.  Even if not paralyzed, she could die of internal bleeding or have any number of injuries, if you think there's the possibility you've injured her.

This is how they behave in the bush of Africa so it's not abnormal for them to exhibit the same traits in captivity. As long as you have hides in the tank and the environment is optimal (humidity, heat, etc) and your animal is feeding, defecating, shedding, etc., correctly then I wouldn't be concerned.
OrvTG44laa	Some dogs just have strange feelings towards certain genders.  It may be their voice- dogs are scared of people with big voices.|`|uKpkOss0aa	I have watched many episodes of the Animal Planet television show, It's Me Or The Dog and the dog trainer on there, Victoria Stilwell, has dealt with many dogs that do not like men.  The dogs were either abused or had bad experiences with men that traumatized them.  What I saw Victoria do on the show was she would give the dog chicken any time a man, any man, passed by.  Try doing that with your dog, giving her a piece of chicken when a man walks by or comes near the house.  That way, your dog will begin to associate men with positive things.|`|zfrPmiFtaa	She either had a bad experience before you got her and still remembers, her mom or dad didn't like men for whatever reason, or she is overprotective because she has maybe seen you and a man going somewhere if you catch my drift. In any case, you should start socializing her with men more.|`|hRikwc00aa	You didn't socialize her well enough to men when she was a puppy. Contact a local class/trainer before this gets worse.|`|mrSEJE9paa	maybe your dog is just protecting u and dogs love there owner so maybe u should try 2 figure out y she growls like if she dosnt like the color red thts an example!<br>  thnxs,galad 2 help<br>  sinserly,some1|`|kceGobAXaa	she's just a smart cookie is all.  :)|`|3d4XE1Keaa	When you were socializing her as a puppy, did you socialize her with all different types of men?  Its hard for dogs to generalize the things they learn unless we help them with it.  She may have learned that your husband, brother, father-in-law, etc are ok....but not strangers.  You need to continue working with her before someone doesn't respect her growling and she decides to bite them.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and I just have one problem with your posting.  "Labs are wonderful non-aggressive dogs."  Not all Labs are the same.  Its all in the breeding, socializing, and training.  You're seeing first-hand what happens when dogs aren't socialized enough and exposed to all kinds of people and situations.  Working at a veterinary hospital, I can tell you there are many types of dogs that people assume would never in a million years be aggressive....and they're the ones that growl at us and try to bite.  Yorkies, Chihuahuas, Labs, cocker spaniels, goldens, you name it.  All the cute cuddly ones.  I'd be more willing to hug a strange pit bull at work than a strange cocker spaniel.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I assume you did not raise her from birth? It is possible that before you got her that she may have been abused by a male during her first few weeks. We have a chihuahua names Bear who does not seem to like men at all, even my husband. We got her when she was a year old. We know she must have been abused by a male sometime during the first year. She doesn't hate my husband nor fear him but she will not allow him to pick her up. She doesn't like any men at all. She will allow hubby to hold her if I place her in his arms. She will allow him to pet her if she lies beside him on the couch, but only briefly does she let him make contact. He had stomach surgery 3 years ago for cancer and was in hospital for 9 days. On the day he came home, Bear went to the chair he was sitting in, climbed onto his lap and sat there a few minutes with her head on his chest. It was her way of telling him he loved him and missed him.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	my girls are like that because I get nervous around men
339NqJ84aa	<-- My rescued, domestic bred pet skunk!! Aint he the cutest!!<br>  <br>  I do keep mine in a cage for saftey (when I am not home) and he can roam the house when I am here, he gets along with my dogs and cats, but my dogs are well tolerant of small critters. I use a medium sized dog crate and cover the cage floor with newspapers and newspaper shreds and I give him cozy blankets so he can burrow and nest in them.<br>  <br>  My skunk is a rescue, his original owners didnt feed him a correct diet and as a baby he started developing sezures. Now, 3yrs later he is a happy, healthy skunk.<br>  <br>  Skunks need taurine vitamins daily, I buy mine from vitacost.com in 500mg caps, then I sprinkle 1/2 cap daily on his veggies, make sure you put the vits on cool food, because hot food will ruin the vitamin and then it will have no purpose at all.<br>  <br>  food.. a variety of fresh or frozen veggies, Boombee loves g. peppers, red pepper, broccoli, cauliflower, lima beans, green beans, wax beans, red cabbage, carrots, zuccini, apples, pears, melons. Never feed anything like hotdogs/ fried foods/ lunch meats or anything that is processed garbage. Skunks need a wholesome, fresh diet.<br>  I feed him turkey or chicken daily and some kashi cereals (they need grains) a small amount of cheese or yogurt or cottage cheese and sometimes boiled eggs w/the shell.<br>  Since skunks are nocternal, I feed him at night. I usually give him a cup or so of veggies w/ some fruit and put it in a clean 2liter soda bottle with a small hole cut out so he can grab the veggies. It keeps him entertained. I also used brown paper bags and cut them open then I add small amounts of his food into the paper bags and ball them up and I make a few paper/treat balls and he then has to rip the bags open to get to his food. both are great ways to keep him entertained and keep him mentally stimulated, although the paper bags make a mess(all the pieces of tiny paper on the floor)..I don't mind cleaning up after him.<br>  <br>  I clip Boombee's front nails more then his back (front nails seem to grow faster then the back ones) I just hold his little paw and use people toe nail clippers, but remember skunk nails are ment to be long (they are diggers in the wild) and have long quicks, don't cut his nails too short.<br>  <br>  Skunks do not take well to disapline, and often become very aggressive if people are mean in any way, I have heard they can hold a grudge. When my skunk acts up I give him some yummy veggies and put him in his cage for a little while just to stop annoying me. Make sure you put baby locks on all cupboards because they will get into them and some cupboards have deadly cleaning chemicals.<br>  <br>  Most states require a permit, and I have one for my skunk that needs to be renewed every year so that he is legal for me to own him. <br>  <br>  this is a great site with great information<br>  <a href="http://www.skunkhaven.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skunkhaven.net/</a><br>  Dr. Krupka (skunk vet) is willing to answer any questions you may have and he is great about returning messages even if you are not a client of his.<br>  <br>  It is not recommended for a skunk to get a rabies vac. so I never get Boombee any. but they do need a distemper vac. because they can contract canine distemper and die. I only let a few people pet my skunk, because if for any reason he would bite them, then he can be taken away and euthinized and tested for rabies. Most people I only let them admire him from afar (which most do anyways).<br>  <br>  Boombee is a cuddle bug and enjoys napping on my lap or on my bed with the dogs. He even makes these "kissing" sounds and I will make them back to him and he will respond back with the same cute noises (kinda sounds like your licking your lips).<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  Any other Q's you can drop me an email.<br>  <br>  Also Yahoo has a skunk chat group and its full of great people with knowlegable info on the care of pet skunks.|`|f6vLKIFZaa	A skunk is a wild animal.

TdrgZwnoaa	My cat did this so I threw her outside anyway. Turns out that she actually did want out; she just didn't want to get cold feet. We now put her out for about 15 minutes each day. That seems to satisfy her need of the great outdoors and she doesn't howl anymore. We also got her a companion in the form of a half frozen kitten a Xmas. He keeps her too busy to howl anymore.|`|X67Y1BACaa	Maybe she doesnt like living in the basement? Let her upstairs!!

l0ktQUnWaa	It sounds like a normal shed. It is said that reptiles get moody around this time, uncomfortable! Try to mist him a couple of times a day, this will help the shed. Look at his toes and tail to see if he has any difficulty shedding in these areas. If he does, give him a warm bath a couple of times a day and gently rub these areas.<br>  Good luck!|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	He is scratching to try and get the skin off. I give mine some soaks in nice warm water and that seems to help mine. Don't pull it off as you could injure the scales below it. Sometimes when they go thru a shed they will display totally different behavior. You can also try misting him as that will also help him get the skin off. Give him a nice soak and see what happens. 9 times out of 10 it is just the shedding that is getting to him and he will be back to normal soon.

qdtU1Q1Laa	I do dressage, and I've never heard of her. <br>  <br>  I've taken lessons from other grand prix dressage trainers for way less than that (about $70 for an hour. one on one with the instructor)! There's there's a rider here who's ridden in the olympics and trained an olympic team and he pays about $50 for an hour private lesson. <br>  <br>  If the clinic at your barn was a weekend clinic (like two days long with an hour or two each day) I'd say to go for it, but for $250 for an hour and a half, I personally would not do it!|`|iiNAJfGCaa	If you don't know much about her then no, I wouldn't spend $250. Phillip Dutton gives private 45 minute lessons at his farm in PA for $75 and he won the Pan Am games in eventing in 07 and was on the 08 Olympic eventing team. <br>  <br>  I would suggest just paying to audit. Sometimes you can learn even more just by watching the entire clinic then by riding for two short sessions.|`|QPMaoaSIaa	There are a few questions you need to ask yourself before doing the clinic.<br>  1. What is she going to teach me and is it relevant to my style of riding?<br>  2. Will I need my own horse and tack?<br>  3. Can I find a cheaper clinic with the same standards who will teach me the same thing?<br>  4. Ask your trainer for advice as well.<br>  <br>  Once you've answered all these questions, you can decide whether or not to do the clinic.<br>  I, for one, would do it as I find dressage lessons with a professional to be quite good and you learn a lot. I'm a show jumper but dressage lessons with a pro every now and then help teach me how to control my horse and to really push it into doing amazing things. My show-jumper has learnt leg-yields, shoulder-ins and half pass just from these lessons.<br>  It really can benefit you but you've gotta consider all the options first.<br>  <br>  All the best with your riding.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	That is a fortune.  Darren Chiacchia doesn't even charge that much for his clinics.  If you're not really familiar with her and aren't itching to ride with her, then I'd say no thanks.

I did that last summer at a dressage clinic, and I learned a lot from the clinician's work with all of the different riders and their horses.|`|BkJ7pxQZaa	I don't know anything about Jean... but I'm pretty sure that's what clinics are running at (although a little longer time period) I often find that clinics are helpful but not on a personal level there are so many horses and different things that need to be addressed its hard for the trainer to get to all of them with that amount of time.|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	I videod a clinic, of Heike Kemmer, when she came to the states, and taught.<br>  It was in that price range.<br>  however, she is a world champion, multi-gold winning, international rider.<br>  It was 2 days.
z0Zc7QcTaa	All that you need for a quarantine tank is a used 10gal. tank $10<br>  a used SMALL powerhead $5<br>  about 5 lbs live rock $25<br>  small used heater $5<br>  Lighting is not important.<br>  Fill the tank with water from your main tank|`|Whh0G1eJaa	If your space is very limited, you should consider freshwater aquariums instead of saltwater.  The 5 gallon would work for a quarantine for freshwater, but not for saltwater.<br>  <br>  Saltwater tanks are not for beginners and the bigger the tank, the easier it is to keep the water parameters correct.  A little mistake in a little tank can cost your fish their lives, while your little mistake in a big tank, gets diluted out and is more forgiving.<br>  <br>  Edit: Gotcha - the real problem in trying to keep nano saltwater tanks is the water chemistry and not the filtration. I'd be hesitant to use anything smaller than a 20 gallon for the quarantine tank.  <br>  <br>  And I should have known you were an experienced aquarist, since you are concerned with quarantining new fish!
KtJmEx1zaa	It's the removal of the rawhide, 95% or so. You better find a substitute quickly. You need something with similar texture that she obviously misses, and a similar flavor. I'd call anyone dealing in pet products and the vet too, just get something that does it for her or suffer the wrath of the ghost of rawhide past!<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|6b7UXPUQaa	There's a lot of rawhide out there that doesn't have beef in it. Maybe you can also get her a rope to play with her and for her to chew on. There's also ropes out there that are flavoured. I would probably consult with the vet though, so you can find out what would be good things for her. They're the experts, not people on the internet.|`|sS0uDgz0aa	Try some chicken rawhide or some without beef, my male shih tzu is kind of the same way if he don't have his rawhide he will chew on wood or whatever, I think the rawhide just make there little teeth feel good.

Do you know how old she is? Even if a dog has been spayed they can occasionally get hormonal and go on a rampage. Sort of like an angry woman. Lil<br>  Sometimes dogs just get frustrated. Has anything changed in your life? Do you have new people coming around that the dog isn't used to? If a person (or another pet) isn't properly introduced dogs can get a little wild. You could give her pork hides to chew and see if that has any affect.
6W4ZWOetaa	Hey there!<br>  Here's what I've done.  I notice where they like to poop the most, and I move the litter tray there, and put some of the poop into the tray so they get the idea.  It's a matter of persistence, but it's usually pretty easy.  Rats have a natural tendency to only want to poop in once place, so it comes easily to them to use the pan.<br>  <br>  Sometimes rats just won't use the pan, so don't take it personally if they don't :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OrvTG44laa	They will probably go in the same area.  Just put the litter box in that area.|`|a3FAGYgVaa	Yup, that's pretty much how I did it. That and not using litter outside of their litterbox (I use towels that they prefer to stuff in their house anyway).<br>  <br>  They are mostly good with using the litterbox, but they still will poop a bit around it none the less, and they pee pretty much anywhere too (but I blame that on their male hormones).|`|xB2wRYYBaa	yeh thats what i did but with there old age they go where ever they choose which is quite annoying, and mine pee in there beeding makeing it smell horrible. just keep putting there poop in the tray as much as you can and hopefully they get the jist of it too.
tPGxPDvBaa	Yes but that is $250 for a fully vetted dog. The one you got from the pound was not fully vetted only fixed & rabies shot.  By the time you pay a vet for the additional shots, worms etc you will pay enough if not more for the difference.  They usually don't get taken to the shelters & usually go to rescues instead if the ppl can't find someone which as a cute lil dog doesn't happen often.  I suggest waiting until you can afford to buy your own dog & the vet care.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	Actually, 250 is quite cheap, considering a well-bred (not saying the one at the rescues aren't) dog from a breeder is much higher. If you can't afford for the dog itself, maybe you should rethink about getting one.|`|3d4XE1Keaa	Rescues charge "so much" because they need to cover the costs of everything they did for the dog (food, vet care, etc).  Animal shelters usually charge less in general.  I paid $60 to adopt my pit bull mix, Daisy, several years ago.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, you probably aren't going to find one cheaper than what the rescues are asking for.  Breeders charge a lot more because they have to pay for expensive tests done on the parents to make sure they're healthy (if they're a decent breeder) and you definitely don't want to buy one at a pet store because it will come from a puppy mill, which is just awful.  You never know what could be medically wrong with those dogs.  <br>  <br>  If you want a papillon so badly, just save your money.  Put in applications with the local rescue and wait.  They'll be able to match you with the perfect dog for you.|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	Questions asking about cheap dogs are never popular on YA.<br>  <br>  Basically, if you can't afford the price of the dog, then you can't afford the proper care of the dog.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  You may try searching dogs in the following shelters in GA, here's the link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/shelters/US-GA" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/shelters/US-GA</a>|`|xfBbEgQWaa	If you can't spend $250.

UeOtjPP5aa	Most people are easily confused by the difference between animal WELFARE, and animal RIGHTS. Me, I am against animal rights; however, I am very much for animal welfare.<br>  <br>  Animal rights are supported by such controversial groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals [PETA], and the Humane Society of the United States [HSUS]. These radical groups follow the TRUE definition of animal rights- No animals should be eaten, worn, used for entertainment [circus, dog shows, etc], used for companion purposes [that means NO pets], used for testing, or used by people in any way [no service animals, hunting dogs, therapy pets, etc]. Animal rights groups are often behind mandatory spay/neuter laws, are in general, try to create a world in which no humans use animals for any purpose.<br>  <br>  Animal welfare groups, however, wish to fund rescues, stop pet abuse, educate the public about proper pet care, etc.<br>  <br>  I don't eat meat [for health reasons], and I do not wear fur... HOWEVER, I do this because it is MY right to choose my own lifestyle. If someone wants to eat meat, wear fur, or go to the circus, it is their right to be able to do so, and I am against laws that would restrict such personal freedoms.<br>  <br>  Please people, do your research on animal rights groups and the things they REALLY stand for. I have a few links in my sources that shows the true meaning of animal rights v. animal welfare.|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Hi there,just refer to my YA name-it says it all.<br>  I am 100% for protecting animals rights! I was raised with pets,am raising my daughter with pets and will always have them.I do NOT buy anything leather,nor do I even look @ real furs in the stores-they disgust me!.My 13 year old daughter has been a die hard vegetarian for almost 1 year now,and I highly respect that decision she has made.My husband and I are not vegetarians,but when I cook meals,I try very hard to be respectful to her and do not rub our "food choices" in her face.We have also tried to severely cut back in our meat consumption.<br>  I wrote a thesis about animal rights back in college that was put on display in the literature dept for all staff/students to read.I did weeks of research to back my claims and am very proud of it...Now if I can only locate a copy,I'd send it to you.<br>  Keep up the good work!|`|XK9RLaPeaa	Animals are treated like objects by people, not living feeling beings. Animals have the right to live free of suffering and cruelty by humans. But in reality, they are kept in horrible conditions in the meat and dairy industry, in fur farms, testing facilities, etc. There are plenty of substitutes to almost everything animals are used for. Most of the information gathered from animal testing is useless to us because the effects are different in humans anyway. Those animals go through hell, and it is usually useless. If you are really into animal rights, you should consider the vegan lifestyle. It is contradictory to believe that animals have rights, and then eat them (especially when they are kept in such horrible conditions). Research Factory Farms, and Dairy/Egg Farms. You will be horrified if you already dont know. www.goveg.com <br>  It is great that you have chosen to go vegetarian. You are really doing a great thing for the animals and the environment. But when you get adjusted to the meatless lifestyle, you should consider veganism. Animals on dairy and egg farms are kept in horrible conditions also. But they have to live in the abuse and confinement for years, before their production slows and they are slaughtered as well. The males on the dairy and egg farms are either killed immediately after birth, or the calves are sent to veal farms. So when you eat these products, you are giving your money straight to their abusers. But give yourself some time to adjust to vegetarianism before you make the transition. Its better to take it slow, to ensure the lifestyle sticks instead of you getting overwhelmed and going back to meat. Good luck!<br>  Edit: Wow, "Proud". It beg to differ about your comment on vegetarians not being bigger animal lovers than meat eaters. If someone is willing to eat an animal that was kept in such cruel conditions, they are NOT an animal lover. Vegetarians, and especially vegans, acually take action instead of just preaching that they love animals. And if your sister was an environmentalist, she would know more about how meat eating effects the environment. Factory Farms (where most of our meat comes from) is the biggest cause of pollution--> Global Warming. You cant be an environmentalist, and still eat meat.|`|Czh1fbQgaa	ANIMALS ARE NOT PEOPLE! I personally LOVE to eat meat. I had chicken, ribs, and beef brisket for dinner and it was great. I don't really like poaching and stuff for fur coats and aligator boots and whatnot. Its not very nice. Testing on animals is totally fair. What is more valuable? A mouse thats only going to live for up to 2 years anyway or the safety of a human being!?!?!? Thats not fair. They have to test things like that so they don't give people cancer or turn their hair blue. Animals are NOT people and people are the superior life forms. Animals are not equal. But I'm not saying you can treat them like toys or heartlessly kill them for clothing. I don't believe you should ever give up your animal once you make a commitment to it. If you decide its not for you, thats your fault for not doing research before you bought it.<br>  So yeah, animals need to be treated like animals. Not as important as people, but not just trash. And eating meat is natural.|`|CjW8DkoEaa	totally but then the government would be sad because they don't get ton's of money from breeders like this one<br>  <br>  watch this this video <br>   <a href="http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/petsm..." rel="nofollow">http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/petsm...</a><br>  and look at these these pics<br>  <a href="http://www.petsmartcruelty.com/photo_gal..." rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmartcruelty.com/photo_gal...</a><br>  these are real animals have feelings too, and if you buy from Petsmart they will just get more animals, and more animals will suffer. These are real pics, and that is real torture.<br>  <br>  <br>  they also wouldn't get money from whalers<br>  GOSH!!  i hate people who only care about money!!!|`|ynkJ09QJaa	i know!!!!!...i think animal rights should be more well looked at. They shouldn't make fur clothes...the only thing they should be killed for(and painlessly) is meat, because us humans need protein...|`|OrvTG44laa	I hate animal testing and fur coats.  Animal cruelty laws need to be more tough.|`|7MtjF084aa	i believe animals do need to be treated humanely and i alsoo believe they were put here as our source of food.. we as humans are omnivores so we eat animals and vegetables.. i don't believe animals should be treated cruelly though i hate they kill like 100 rabbits to make one coat... its disgusting.. if they used all the animals that they turn into clothes i bet they could feed a whole country
mFf8CqAraa	Of course there are always exceptions. <br>  <br>  If you got to a put store, they have dozens of the teddy bear (or other breeds) in cages together.<br>  <br>  When we were younger, my sister had a female teddy and I had a male. The male was VERY sweet but when we first put them together, they fought in little balls. We ended up introducing them the same way you would introduce a new cat or dog to your home (hold them both and let them sniff each other). Eventually we were able to put them together without any problems and they later had kids.<br>  <br>  At another point in time, I put a son in the same cage with his father (his mother had passed away and his siblings were sold) and remarkably, they got along great.<br>  <br>  So there's always exceptions to the "rule" like the gorilla who adopted a baby kitten and the lion that protected her baby prey after losing her own cub. Sometimes it's all in how you do it and in other cases, it's just nature defying itself.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|0LxgeSJnaa	Yeah until there is another hamster. Don't get another.|`|TeJU7MQ4aa	He may be very gentle and nice to you,but put another male in there and your gonna see a side of him you've never seen before.If you put a female in with him,the same thing could happen or they are going to get along alot more than you want them to. Hampsters can have babies every 16 days.I would recommend 2 seperate cages.|`|TqoKXzgEaa	well if they were born together I wouldn't be worried about it.....BUT if itwas the same breed I would let them get used to each other B4 you put let together like put thim in 1 of those metal gat thing that you hook together so they can used to each other!!! ....|`|PB5IRRclaa	wat u hav to do is . well first let me ask u r they related if they r it can be possible. but if not don't trust me they can kill one another.|`|ntmsNk5Jaa	No matter how sweet they are. They will fight. Do not cage 2 together. Make use of the extra cages.|`|XTtdeCFFaa	No, all Syrian hamsters are territorial animals and should be kept alone in separate cages. The only breed of hamster that can share a cage is a dwarf hamster. All other breeds are solitary animals, and, even though your hamster is sweet to you, he will fight another hamster if he comes across it, because it is in their instinct to defend their territory. In the wild, these hamsters don't even share space with their mates. If you get another hamster, you should keep him/her in one of your other cages.
zqVDJxUIaa	800 liters will be enough. Freshwater aquariums need a turnover rate of approximately 4 times the tank's volume per hour minimum, preferably 6 or more. Your filter circulates 8 times the tank's volume, which is perfect!<br>  <br>  You need a 150 watt heater, or a 100 watt. A general rule is 3 to 5 watts per gallon, (3.8 liters).<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|YRDDAThEaa	go to your loacl fish store and look at filter....and a heater is best new so the box will sayin gallons|`|33oAfqGnaa	i don't know about the heater but <br>  Your filter choice is great. On average the filter should process the water 4-5 times per hour. But that would process 8 times which is very awesome.
wjwsFPMuaa	The first few heats for a bit ch can be out of whack. Though it sounds more like to me that your male is trying to dominate her rather than mount her for mating purposes.<br>  <br>  If you are CERTAIN she is no longer in heat, then see if she is receptive to your male. I would tend to lean toward the dominance factor in this situation though.<br>  <br>  If she is in heat again then I would have her checked out. Not every dog will tolerate heat cycles well and she MAY need spayed to avoid any potential future problems.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I guess we can assume that "don't litter" doesn't get out much.  Because a lot of responsible breeders I know have seen this in some dogs.  It's probably not much different then how humans have "irregular" cycles when they're younger and hopefully after this cycle she'll even out and go into heat twice a year.  However, in some dogs, there is a hormonal imbalance which will cause their cycles to be very unpredictable.   If that's the case, if she's going into heat at odd times, as a result of stress or what have you, then you should spay her and not breed her.  Because she's likely to pass that trait along and that's not a good trait to pass along.<br>  <br>  So, since she's still very young, I wouldn't fret on this one, but if it continues that way, get her spayed.|`|Bw18seFqaa	its unusual for a dog to cycle that often.<br>  <br>  Really, the best advice for you would be to have her seen by a vet.  She may have a serious uterine infections..  infections can sometimes make a female smell like she is in heat, which is why your male is trying to mount her.<br>  <br>  If its an infection, be prepared to spay her.. this is often the protocall to treat uterine infections.|`|AA10400143	Seeing she is young, i would say is is normal. The first few heat cycles can be "abnormal" just like ppl. Her heat cycles should become more regular after a few.|`|PM23RDycaa	Not every dog cycles by the 6 month rule. Some can go sooner or later. HOWEVER if you want an informed opinion talk to the breeder you got her from or I don't know a VET rather than strangers on the net. And unless she's a show dog/breed prospect or you have NO problem cleaning up after her 2-4 times a year when she in heat and keeping her AWAY from her male get her fixed. That's not from animal planet that's from growing up around responsible breeders and owners|`|fgxajTiBaa	Really? I think your directing childish ignorant crap to the wrong people.<br>  <br>  I didn't learn any of my information on 'Animal TV' I work at a shelter.<br>  <br>  And I wouldn't know because all the Yorkies I've known have been owned by responsible people who have spayed/neutered.<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm still holding to the fact that responsible breeders don't need to be asking questions like this on yahoo.<br>  <br>  And Jen, you're the one that thinks all shelter dogs are sick, so I think you need to get out a little more.

Rw7gi86Naa	I don't believe you when you say you have no choice. He's better off with his toes and a new home.<br>  <br>  Before you decide to have your cat declawed, there are many things you should know before you make your decision.  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats that have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat that has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs its claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: <br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a>|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Why can you not just trim the nails and use the SoftPaws nail caps?  You can have a lot of physical and emotional problems by declawing.  I know you don't want negative comments, but you should read this about declawing to be prepared for possible negative outcomes.<br>  <br>  If you have negative problems after declawing, then YOU have to deal with the damage and not take them to the shelter cause of biting, not using the litter pan or peeing on carpets, clothes, beds.<br>  <br>  Some cats take longer to heal and you have to watch for infections in the feet when they are in the litter pan.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/Truth%20About%20Declawing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/Truth%20About%20Dec...</a>|`|oDVx7nSxaa	How long?  Never - they will be in pain the rest of their lives.  Their nails are not declawed - the first joints of their toes are chopped off.  That's the facts - negative or otherwise.  If you have to get rid of them because of their claws, what's going to happen if they decide they aren't going to use the litter box because of their painfully deformed feet?  Then you'll be getting rid of two cats that won't use the litter box - not exactly adoptable cats.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	The actual wounds will heal in a couple of weeks (if the job isn't botched, which is common). Emotionally and behaviorally, they will never heal.  Declawed cats have to learn to walk in an unnatural manner due to their toes being partially amputated.  As a result they often develop arthritis.  They usually resort to some other means of defense such as biting and frequently refuse to use a litter box. Shelters are full of declawed cats whose owners turned them in due to issues they developed post-op.  There are plenty of alternatives to declawing that don't involve mutilation. Soft Paws nail caps are just one of these.<br>  <a href="http://declaw.lisaviolet.com/" rel="nofollow">http://declaw.lisaviolet.com/</a>|`|AJxl0IvHaa	It will take around 2 to 3 weeks.<br>  Dont let them jump around too much, and as for litter.<br>  NO LITTER. Just shred paper for i think 3 weeks... maybe 1 or 2 but the vet should tell you..<br>  If your cats seem to be in pain.... ask for pain meds.<br>  And for the save of money and pain... just do their front claws.<br>  Thats what I did when i declawed my kittys.|`|X67Y1BACaa	I remember when my cats were declawed, we had to use newspaper instead on litter for a while so the little pieces of litter wouldnt get stuck in where their claws used to be.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Then get rid of them. If you love your cats, you will rehome them rather than mutilate them. Rehome them with someone who won't cut off the tips of their toes.<br>  <br>  Do you realize what goes into declawing? It's not a simple removal of the claws but a full blown amputation of healthy toes. Declawing a cat means removing the entire first joint/bone of each toe. It'd be like cutting our fingers off at the first knuckle. Declawing causes extreme pain to the cat and often problems down the line (litter box issues from associating the litter box with pain after surgery, personality changes/biting/and skittishness from having their first line of defense removed, arthritis from having to learn a new way of carrying their weight etc.). I hear people say all the time "better declawed than in a shelter", but in actuality many declawed cats end up in shelters anyway because of the behavioral problems many experience after being declawed.<br>  <br>  Did you know it's illegal and considered inhumane mutilation in most countries outside the U.S.? I've personally observed a declaw surgery at a vet and it's not a pretty sight to watch a vet take guillotine nail clippers and lop off parts of toes... very barbaric looking (laser removal has less healing time and pain, but really isn't that much better in the long run). Please don't put your furniture over your cat's well being, it's just selfish. Declawing has no benefits to the cat, only the owner. There are numerous alternatives including scratching posts and surfaces, sticky tape, deterrent sprays, Soft Paws nail caps, and nail trimming.

This is not a negative comment, I am thinking of the cats' welfare.|`|xfBbEgQWaa	Boo!! Shame on you!|`|R2aTEi9Kaa	I'm not leaving "negative comments" for you, I'm trying to save your cat and you better believe I"m gonna do my best to speak for your cat that becaseu she has no voice to speak for herself. There are alternatives and if you love your cat at all you will at least read through my post before putting them through the surgery.<br>  <br>  Declawing isn't declawing it all, its De-toeing, the vet performs 10 radical AMPUTATIONS of the cats toes down to the first knuckle. The vet also severs four major tendons which permanently prevent the cat from stretching whats left of its mutilated toes. The vet also severs and cauterizes major arteries and blood vessels. A cats claws grow directly out of BONE, the only way to remove the nail bed is to remove the bone that makes up the entire first knuckle of the cats toes.<br>  <br>  The surgery is excruciating for the cat and anyone who says different (in this post or other posts or even on different forums or in person) does not know anything about the nature of a cat. To a cat Pain is a sigh of weakness, in the wild weak animals are picked off and eaten so as such cats are ABSOLUTE MASTERS at hiding their pain, because they DO NOT under any circumstance want to appear week. ALL cats suffer tremendously after this surgery, most wake up and are in so much agony that they scream and fly all over their kennels bashing their heads against the walls trying to make the pain go away.<br>  <br>  Cats WALK on their TOES, this surgery removes those toes and then the cat is forced to immediately walk on his or her mutilated and sore feet. Imagine having half of your foot cut off and then being forced to walk on whats left of them...because of the anatomy of a cats foot and claws it is EXACTLY the same. (It is also comparable to cutting off human fingers at the first knuckle, not the knuckle directly under your finger nail but the knuckle below that).<br>  <br>  MANY cats stop using the litterbox after being declawed because they associate it with pain as they have to dig to use it and digging with mutilated feet is agony directly after surgery and the cat maintains that association for the rest of his or her life.. Instead they resort to using the furniture and carpets as their litterbox. MANY cats also resort to biting as a defense mechanism as their main defense is gone. (If the cat is already aggressive, he will continue to attack her but will instead bite her HARD as he has no other means of defense)<br>  <br>  MANY cats stop trusting humans after this procedure and become emotionally scared, bitter, angry and anti social and remain that way for the duration of their life. (this makes them MORE aggressive and as I said before he will simple bite rather then scratch)<br>  <br>  Can you deal with a neurotic fear biting cat who is using your entire house as his personal litterbox???<br>  <br>  Also the cat will be unable to properly defend itself if it gets outside as the front claws are a cats primary mode of defense and a declawed cat will not stand a chance against a clawed cat, dog, coyote etc...<br>  <br>  The next thing you needs to understand is that cats are physically UNABLE to stretch the muscles in their front quarters, sides, back, and front legs because they do so by digging in their claws and pulling back against them, without their claws this is physically impossible to do. De clawed cats are therefor prone to muscle stiffness, spasms, and arthritis. (NOTE: this conditions are degenerative and can take many years to fully manifest).<br>  <br>  Not to mention that because cats walk on their toes, the removal of those toes permanently alters the way the cat walks which alters the cats gait (position of his or her spine, neck and legs) which usually leads to back and hip pain. ( that again the cat will hide until its unbearable).<br>  <br>  Another side effect of this surgery is painful regrowth of the claw inside the pad. Occasionally if the surgery is not properly performed the claw begins to regrow inside the pad on the cats foot, as I stated earlier cats HIDE their pain so you will not know about this regrowth until the cat is in absolute agony and cannot take the pain anymore.<br>  <br>  This surgery is a barbaric mutilation that many vets perform and even condone for the simple fact that they make alot of money doing it. The typical cost for a front declaw in Canada and the US is $300 so you can imagine the profit for the vet.<br>  <br>  You may also have heard that laser declawing is less painful and involves a quicker recovery, this is TOTAL BS. In order for the laser to be effective is has to burn through bone, burns through the bone are FOURTH degree burns. Laser declawing is actually MORE painful but the laser machine costs a single veterinarian upwards of $30,000 so they advocate the procedure to make their money back (yes the recovery is slightly shorter because the wounds are instantly cauterized but it is still absolute agony for the cat).<br>  <br>  The The last thing I want to explain is why cats actually scratch, so that you understand the mechanics.<br>  1) They scratch to shed the outer most layer of the nail, a cats nail is like an onion and if they don't shed the dead outer sheath their claws will get sore and infected. (when a cat scratches a scratching post it DOES NOT dull the nail, it sharpens it, however, it is necessary to provide an adequate scratching surface for the cat)<br>  2) There are scent glands on the pads of a cats foot so whenever they scratch something they are marking it with their scent.<br>  3) As I already stated before they NEED their claws to stretch their muscles.<br>  4) Kittens DO NOT have proper control over the retraction of their claws, it takes a little over a year for them to learn this control. So they generally scratch everything because their claws are always out. As he ages and matures he WILL learn how to retract them and keep them retracted. (often what some people perceive as aggression is simple an over zealous and very playful kitten who will calm down once he reaches adult hood).<br>  <br>  ALTERNATIVES<br>  The best thing to do (what you HAVE to do) is clip the cats nails every two weeks with a good quality pair of nail clippers to remove the sharp tip. Also make sure to provide scratch posts large enough for the cat to climb on and sleep on (at least four feet or higher) and spray it with a catnip spray to attract the cat.<br>  <br>  Put double sided tape on the corners of couches and any walls she tends to scratch as well as chairs and anything she scratches, You can also put tinfoil on corners (Cats hate the way it feels on their paws), You can spray the cat with water every time you catch her scratching something, and you can also use a spray like bitter apple or cat friendly (meaning non toxic) lemon spray ON THE FURNITURE ONLY, to deter the cat from the furniture. (they hate the smell, and hate the taste when they lick it off their paws).<br>  <br>  You can also use something called Soft Paws, they are vinyl nail covers that go over the cats claws and they last about six weeks.<br>  <br>  Declawing is illegal in 23 countries for being cruelty to animals. It is a cruel, needless, barbaric mutilation of an innocent animal who cannot speak for itself.<br>  <br>  Please don't do this, anyone who is informed of the risks and side effects and still has the surgery done is no animal lover and should never be allowed to own anther cat.<br>  <br>  Blessings to your kitten<br>  <br>  ADD: I just wanted to share a few stories about declawed cats.<br>  <br>  1) I have a friend who declawed her cat when he was a kitten, he now bites every human who comes near him and usually hides under the bed because he doesn't trust any humans.<br>  <br>  2)I just read a story today about a woman who had her cat laser declawed and she DIED within three weeks of the surgery from complications.<br>  <br>  3) Another cat lost BOTH of his hind legs from a botched 4 paw declaw.<br>  <br>  Are you willing to take those kind of risks? I love my cats far to much to EVER risk their health for such a selfish surgery|`|TWBg9F18aa	It would be better to get rid of them then to a GOOD family who would use scratching posts and spray bottles to discourage scratching. They will never become normal again. Imagine if someone cut your finger tips off at the top knuckle, that is what would be happening to them. For the rest of their lives they will be disfigured and in pain and they will be very jumpy and unhappy. I've seen first hand what kind of changes declawing a cat can make in their personality and health. Please please please find another owner for these cats or researching spray bottle usage for training, it's very simple and effective whereas declawing is possibly one of the most selfish plainly evil thing you can do to an animal.

XC36OOiTaa	I for one am very glad not to be a puppy owned by "Omen".  Neglecting basic care of puppies by not vaccinating them for serious diseases is nothing to be proud of.  Any person who listens to her "advice" is asking for a dead puppy.  The treatment plan that "Omen" outlines is not designed for success.  Her plan is for people who don't want to (or can't) spend money on their pet for proper treatment by a veterinarian.  Please vaccinate your puppies for parvo.  Ask a vet for treatment recommendations.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the hijack.  As for the chinese crested, he should see a vet ASAP.  Even if you take him to a vet and find out it is only a cold, it is better than him getting sicker and more difficult to treat by waiting.  Good luck.|`|sS0uDgz0aa	with it having a bad smell i would take him and and just have a parvo test there like 25$ it worth it, but a puppy with all of its shots can still get parvo.|`|ZnZSVPztaa	Just take him to the vet tomorrow.|`|kN0Qr52Jaa	My dogs (which I've raised since birth) are healthy as a horse and haven't had shots. They had the same thing when they were 3-4 months old. Same symptoms. Whatever you do, don't give them a parvo shot because a vaccination is made of some of the disease which makes it worse. Give your dog sugar water, rice water, or kool-aid with a syringe about every hour. The sugar will give them energy so they can get up and do what they usually do. My dogs are standard chihuahuas and they were over it in about 2 days.  Just keep giving them what I told you above, about 1-2 tablespoons every hour or two. They should get at least a little better. My runt started eating that night. but don't expect the same results. It may take longer, or it may take less time. Good luck with your baby.|`|Riybmw63aa	I had a dog that got parvo and I saved him by giving him a raw egg and a b12 vitamin daily|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	It won't cost 3 grand to see the emergency vet.  Request an estimate for services before any treatment is done.<br>  <br>  Anyways, lethargic all day, and vomiting throughout the day, not eating or drinking.  I would recommend seeing the emergency vet tonight.  <br>  <br>  Discuss your budget with the doctor so that they can work within your budget to provide appropriate care.|`|d4IJIV05aa	well it seems like you dog may have parvo.<br>  my dog got parvo and we were tight on money you can still take him to the vet<br>  what we did was call a bunch of animal places that help sick animals <br>  such as angels for animals, actors and other animals .
F5vsY4rOaa	I raise Lutinos and can tell you for a fact they are the very hardest variety of Cockatiels to breed of four males all siblings from different lays I got one fertile male and of the eggs his mate laid over half were duds. I would suggest you remove the nest box for a few months and supply her with plenty of cuttle bone and mineral blocks let her build back up a while.<br>  We rest or hens for at least six weeks after a lay usually by removing the hen as soon as the male starts to act frisky. Once she is back in shape you can put them back together along with the box.<br>  When she lays her eggs candle them with a bright light look for a slightly darker area it should be visable in six to ten days depending on when she started the actual incubation sometimes they fool you by shoving the eggs off in the corner until the are done laying all their eggs it is actually alright to leave the infertile eggs in the box in is a sort of birth control as long as she has a pile she won't want more the trick is to train her to come out at least three times a day most of my pairs split the duties and the male sits the eggs while the hen is out of the box often all day your pair is young and inexperienced so you will have to teach her it's alright to come out but make sure you set her over a paper or you won't like the mess I have managed to train two of my hens wait to dump their loads until I set them on a window perch <br>   If you have no fertile eggs after two lays give it up and don't ever give them back a box they will probably still mate off and on and you will find an egg in the corner of the cage now and then but the odds will be against it being any good|`|6GSxA9glaa	Do you have a nest box for the hen to incubate the eggs?  The male may not be fertile due to age, poor diet, inbreeding,...  The hen could be over taxed from laying to often.  <br>  <br>  If everything else seems fine I would check with my vet.|`|3tAmFznUaa	Make sure the perches are the right size for their feet and securely attached to the cage.  If the footing is not secure, the male can't fertilize the eggs even if you see him trying.|`|dbe3949bbbedd96e00cdf1a2462e0484aa	are you sure your male is a male a young bird won't have the plumage  the best way is to get them sexed then you know for sure|`|UETAqR8Taa	they aren't fertilised. take to an avian vet (the birds) and see if there is a fertility problem|`|0B4plcLEaa	For some reason they are not being fertilized. I breed as a hobby, and this happens to alot of breeders. Birds are like people...some are fertille and some aren't. Is your male at least 12 months old? If he is any younger that could be your problem. Males that aren't sexually mature cannot fertilize eggs. And Paula was right about making sure perches are secure. In some cases infertility has been traced back to unstable perches. Sometimes there is nothing you can do...it is just something wrong with the bird that prevents it from being able to produce...just like some people cannot have children.
Jtd7kXQSaa	It is not impossible to idea any cichlid. If you have a pitcher then I would tell you what it is. And btw good job at not buying the fish before trying to do some research about it first. As far as the 10 gallon tank goes. Yes you can keep the fish in it for a short time, but Not for ever. So if do decide to get this fish. Be prepared to get a larger tank in the near future. Good fish keeping to you.|`|ad7c42cce90c3663b9c47e1866a1347aaa	like everyone else said, no. its not suitable for the cichlids to live in a 10 gallon esp if theres a few of them. as they grow in it,theyll get more aggresive with one another. and if would be smart to have at least a picture of what you want to ID. if you dont know any info about it nor a name, that should be more of a reason not to get it also. sorry, but i dont think you should get another one and get a larger tank.|`|1YNhKzeqaa	No, cichlids need a bigger tank than just 10 gallons, and you need to pack the tank with them. If you get allot, they will lose each other in the crowd and not be able to beat each other up as much. Cichlids get pretty big. You can find tons of cichlid care info just by doing a google search.|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	To be honest, there aren't many cichlids, if any, that can go into a 10 gallon. I would suggest doing research and finding another type of fish for your tank. If you need help, try asking at tetra-fish.com/forums|`|9mlY5cB1aa	no cichlid can live in a tank that is 10 gallons, so the answer is no....|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	No type of Cichlid is suitable for a 10 gallon, you can keep them in there for about a month or two at most.<br>  <br>  Don't get him unless you can afford a 20+ gallon tank, also most all cichlids are very messy, food coming out of there gills and that food that is actually digested has to go somewhere too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!

It was a little unnerving!|`|CvsrmBn6aa	Maybe he LOVES you so much...you know...he needs to see you..<br>  <br>  LOljk but anyway lots of cats do this. They HAVE to be petted while Im on th toilet.

The cat wants someone to come out of the bathroom and give her some food.|`|UETAqR8Taa	yes and my pups. its a very exciting place in there! theres noise, toilet paper to rip into, flushing, water washing hands, clothes been moved. All very exciting for animals LOL|`|uKpkOss0aa	I have never heard of a cat pounding on the door but mine likes to follow me into the bathroom, pretty much anywhere I go in the house.  If I close my bedroom door, she will bat her paw on the calendar that hangs on the back of my door to let me know that she wants out.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Haha... yes! I have always found that funny. Us humans are not allowed to have privacy in the bathroom, but have you ever noticed how they seem to give you a dirty look if you catch a glance at them in the litter box!<br>  <br>  And I love seeing a paw randomly feeling around under a door.

So cute!|`|0a931d251e569a4d6a05c6a5cf00742aaa	My cat Chance does this all the time, I am not sure why he does though, must be a cat thing lol.|`|d6bUhFnjaa	my cat dose the same cuz she thinks im her mama

Hoping to get into competition obedience soon!|`|AA11026827	My avatar is a picture of me and my dog, A German Shepherd Dog.|`|hRikwc00aa	1 - My avatar picture is of Cricket, my longhaired whippet (also called windsprite) at four months.<br>  <br>  I know I may get flamed for this so I'll bore you with a little history.<br>  <br>  No, this breed (also called windsprite) is not accepted by any major kennel clubs, mainly because of the controversy surrounding the creation of the breed. The original "founder", Walter Wheeler, lied about how he created the breed. He said he'd found a "recessive longhaired gene" (that no one had ever seen before) in his whippets. He also bred Shelties at the time. A gene has been found in LHW's (Mdri1) that is found in many herding breeds but not in whippets.<br>  <br>  Many people are outraged by this, but it has been done before; dachshunds were bred to spaniels and borzois to a collie/shepherd type dog for long fur. This is not purely aesthetic; I adore whippets but I live in a cold climate and spend a lot of time outdoors. I know several people who hunt with them; not only does their longer fur keep them warm, but it also protects them from brambles, etc.<br>  <br>  It is believed that a small, longhaired, whippet-like dog existed hundreds of years ago in Europe, but they have long since gone extinct in favor of the sleeker-looking whippets of today. The longhaired whippet is a recreation of this breed.<br>  <br>  Sorry. xD I'm done.<br>  <br>  2 - Cricket is primarily my companion; she goes everywhere with me. I do compete in obedience, conformation, agility, lure-coursing, and flyball with her, but she is not a "show dog", she is a dog who competes in shows - if that makes any sense.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	~~~~~~~~~~Here is my baby....shhhh, don't tell her that she is a dog.....lol.....she thinks that she is just a fuzzy kid!! <br>  She is my bestest friend, I tell her everything and she is a very good listener.

zqVDJxUIaa	Good. You bought a filter. Unfortunately, a pump with a stone is NOT A FILTER. It is simply... a pump with a stone. It provides no filtration whatsoever, but it oxygenates the water, which is also important (but not as important as a filter) Get a filter immediately! A small one would work fine, as long as it has some carbon in it. Use one that is designed for 5 gallons or less, since you have a small tank, and so that you don't stress the fry by using one with a strong current. Feed the fry some cooked egg yolk (they love this, it's high in protein), or some brine shrimp. you can also crush up flake food into powder to feed them. <br>  <br>  Using pebbles won't help at all. <br>  <br>  Sorry for telling you that you didn't have a filter, but just a pump... but the truth is always better!<br>  <br>  You also need a small heater (25w) will do, because guppies are tropical fish.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1YNhKzeqaa	I have been raising guppies for years now, and I have tried using breeders nets, separate tanks, and live plant cover in the main tank. In my experience, live plant cover is easier than using a breeder's net and more cost effective than getting a separate tank. My favorite plant is the micro sword, if you plant it in a fine substrate, in time it will give you a beautifully lush "lawn" on the bottom of your tank and it will hide your little fry from danger. Just watch out for mondo grass aka kyoto, as this is NOT a true aquatic plant and will die and pollute your tank.
axylPYftaa	my cat never gets periods, only diarrhea|`|AhBJT5xFaa	Maybe|`|ZbE9SBQ2aa	yes except fishes|`|1s2LSgqPaa	if they are a female, yeah|`|D9iE2JBKaa	they get fur balls|`|qXect0N7aa	Many types of animals have periods of time where they can become pregnant.

Right after this time, there is a period when the dog can become pregnant.|`|IMwLQG1haa	yes they do, some puppies if they have not gotten "fixed" yet have to wear diapers or something because they do have menstrual cycles. but only females get them.|`|DNp2xge9aa	hmm..im not sure if fish and monkeys dooo...but my dog and cat both did. You just don't notice it as much because they are always lickin down there to clean themselves.|`|mc59Y5vwaa	fish, no, but most mammals go into heat... for dogs it would generally be about every 6 months.|`|PTWnWkPRaa	Until my dog got her tubes tied, she had her period.<br>  Im really not sure for fish.

0nIwKd5Uaa	I'vee always got them by the middle then bring them close to your body.  Put one of your hands at the base of the tail where the butt and tail meet that will calm the chinchilla down. Don't hold that part to tight because a chinchilla can detach it's tail (it don't grow back). But while holding the base of the tail you can stroke or pet your chinchilla.<br>  <br>  Sorry didn't read the whole question properly. Do not directly pick the chinchilla up by it's tail or by it's fur. <br>  <br>  Also try doing all of your handling at night. Chinchillas tend to be grouchy during the day.|`|gM3tw8Ifaa	do you mean at a store or just holding it? <br>  Holding: let it sniff the back of your hand, stroke it, then slowly scoop it up <br>  Store:Don't be rough with it...lol hope that helps|`|WqVawp0Kaa	put both hands under its belly,<br>  support its feet,<br>  then keep it close to you so they feel secure.<br>  EDIT: Don't pick it up by the tail and obviously dont grab at it's legs, other than that it's pretty obvious where you shouldn't pick it up. Just be gentle.<br>  Pick it up often and hold it close so it bonds with you.<br>  The MOST important thing is to keep your chin cool. When it gets warm, put a water bottle in the freezer. When it's frozen take it out and put a sock on it (because it will thaw and get your chins fur all wet and nappy). Stick it in the cage during the day while you're at work/school. Your chin will snuggle up to it all day :) If you leave the house for a long time in the summer have someone watch your chin or leave the A/C on. They are EXTREMELY heat sensitive and will have a stroke!|`|qjFu9SjKaa	Once you open the cage he should jump on you if not then gently pick him up and SECURELY hold him. chinchillas like to be securely held rather then roughly held,<br>  Good luck|`|ZdQtNNI9aa	Scoop him up under his belly. While holding him, if he isn't calm, gently hold the base of his tail so he can't escape. This will not hurt him.
3z0NLTGYaa	You can buy wafer and small pelleted food designed for bottom feeders.  cat and dog food kibble also works well as long as it is higher quality food.  <br>  <br>  I've offered mine small bits of both raw and lightly cooked meats (beef, chicken, pork, and fish).  I also keep some neons in the tank specifically for when he decides he'd like to hunt for himself.  The key is to find a balance that doesn't foul the water.|`|szzoxJRBaa	shrimp pellets are the best. you could also try an assortment of frozen foods - mine tends to like the blood worms. but shrimp pellets is by far the best - they sink to the bottom and are great for carnivores|`|R4IWxA0Xaa	crushed up catfood. they also like shrimp pellets (you can get them at a pet store)|`|wBzp5fOjaa	small fish and bits of meat and each other!|`|kjAWsDwLaa	Anything that won't eat them first; crayfish are scavengers.  The other answer sounds good, just don't put in too much or it will foul the water.

gpVSRFuOaa	Its totally fine! They arent picky. Try not to feed him artificial crap you know? Even though they say it's healthy? Well....think about it...All that artificial machine made crap isnt natural so its not healthy. Also once in a while cut up some fruit, vegetables fresh for your hamsster to enjoy. It will also extend its life! Foods like cherios, noodles, rice are completely natural and healthy so feed variety from fresh food to seeds!:)|`|qlDV1OZwaa	ask your hamster what it wants to eat....|`|xfBbEgQWaa	you should be ok. do you have any old food that you can mix with the new stuff until he gets used to it
1cJjGNOBaa	what KIND of hamster you have makes no difference! ALL rodents love a bit of fresh veggies and fruit- every day! So go ahead and offer your pet some bits of carrot, lettuce (the leafy kind), apple, etc. Remeber, not TOO much as they are such small critters!!! Hope he tames easily- you should have got a guinea pig or rat if you wanted an easily tamed pet!!!!|`|UlOKMInqaa	Yes, carrots are fine. Smaller ones like baby carrots are best. Even then you can break those apart to make them last longer. Hamsters are small so they don't need a whole lot anyways. Hand feeding the hamster can help build trust. By having him get food from your hands, he'll begin to associate you with good things like treats and learn that you won't harm him!|`|GtBOQPKqaa	The bits of carrot should be a treat, really, when trying to tame it.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to handle him to tame him. By doing this often, he will become more relaxed when being handled by you.<br>  <br>  A few years ago, I had a total of three hammies over the course of three years, and I handled them daily. It worked.|`|mtbGz0txaa	yes, it is perfectly fine to feed your hamster carrots as treats. by doing this you are actually making your hamster healthier by giving it fresh veg. You can also put bits of carrot in your hamsters food dish to maintain a healthy diet for your hamster,, glad i could help <br>  <br>  jessica x|`|0LxgeSJnaa	It's totaly fine to give any rodent vegis. Just make sure it's not a lot all the time.|`|TqoKXzgEaa	yes,make sure the piecess are cut up into 4s!!! like X something like that!!!!|`|6Rt9aM8daa	Yes, but make sure they are not that big. Every day check the cage for remains of the fresh food so they don't rot or get spoiled.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
5TCewPYRaa	not exactly---a good NBHA time is around 15 seconds...pretty much anything over 16.4 seconds and you won't place....<br>  <br>  But keep working on your turns and launch from the barrel and you will certainly shave some unnessecary seconds off your time!|`|l9xD9nJzaa	I know at my barn they are running 15 and 16's
q1cxmThHaa	He may have pulled a muscle.<br>  <br>  Try feeling his hindquarters and seeing if one side is a lot tighter than the other, try and gently massage it if so.<br>  <br>  Definitely get to the vet ASAP though, just in case it's something more (like a hip problem), he could be in a lot of pain.  :(|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	pulled muscle might be your answer. or it could be a dislocated joint (which i doubt..). feel around his hips and try to massage them. take him to the vet, best thing to do|`|pyd8zVKNaa	try giving your dog glucosamine. i also heard vitamin c is good
TkJn9gO0aa	1st one is 100% some sort of albino. It is impossible to tell what kind of albino by just a picture or even in person............it can only be confirmed through test breeding or knowing the parents of the gecko.............otherwise we can only make guesses, but we can make good guesses. I would say it looks like a Tremper(Texas) Albino which is also the most common strain of albino on the market. <br>  <br>  2nd picture is a Super Hypo Tangerine Carrot Tail Baldy<br>  <br>  Super = total of 0-12 spots on body ( I see 2-3 on yours)<br>  <br>  Hypo(melanistic) = reduced melanin pigment....basically reduced spotting.<br>  <br>  Tangerine = there is an orange-ish overtone mixed in with the yellow<br>  <br>  Carrot-Tail = A concentrated amount of orange pigment at the start of the tail<br>  <br>  Baldy = no spots on head|`|wLgGD63raa	The first one looks like a rainwater albino to me.

It's colors are pretty dull and a lot darker than typical Tangerines. Tangerines come in a lot of different shades. Super Hypo refers to the amount of spots it has on it's body, carrot tail the orange on it's tail, and baldy the amount of spots on it's head.<br>  <br>  Neither are patternless geckos.<br>  Here's a couple pictures of patternless geckos:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mikescritters.com/critters/reptiles/patternless_leopard_gecko.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mikescritters.com/critters/re...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geckosetc.com/images/avail_patternless600.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.geckosetc.com/images/avail_pa...</a><br>  <br>  And here are a couple pictures of SHTCTB<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geckolair.com/Pictures/breeders/TrishaBIG.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.geckolair.com/Pictures/breede...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gekoncik-nocni.cz/foto/0.1%20Super%20Hypo%20Tangerine%20Carrot%20Tail%20Baldy.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.gekoncik-nocni.cz/foto/0.1%20...</a>|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	Pattenless and high yellow perhaps?

l0ktQUnWaa	I would not suggest getting a lizard just because it is the cheapest. Do some reading, see what kind of lizard you want and what it needs provided for it. These are animals and they deserve to have the proper care provided to them. Too many people buy them because they "cheap" and then the people wonder why they suffer and die. Any animal needs to be respected. All of them take work.<br>  Good luck!|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	Green Anoles are very cheap. At my local pet store, I believe they are 15 dollars. What I like about them is that they don't require very big enclosures-- 10 gallons in the minimum. The problem is, they are more for show and don't like being held very much.<br>  <br>  Although these lizards are cheap to buy, keep in mind that they are hard to care for, will need special heating/lighting setups, weekly cricket purchases (if you don't breed your own), vitamin supplements, special watering techniques, and their tanks or containers will need weekly maintinence and cleaning.|`|v4vyq9Thaa	many times you can adopt lizrads from a humane society or a local herpetological societies for a small adoption fee or even for free. <br>  <br>  Here's a list of herp societies by state:<br>  <a href="http://www.herper.com/forum/societies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.herper.com/forum/societies.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Also you could check out craigslist.org|`|01nMRPHVaa	I suggest a Leopard Gecko.

zqVDJxUIaa	You MUST use a water conditioner (such as Aqua Plus or Aqua Safe) to remove any minerals and contaminants, which are usually abundant in wells. You MUST have a filter for your Betta. Remove him from the bowl! Get a small aquarium (even 2 gallons is fine), but NOT A BOWL! PLEASE! The bowl is killing him, probably even more than the well water. <br>  <br>  Checking for disease will also help:<br>  <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/Disease.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/Disease.htm</a><br>  <br>  DON"T PUT OCEAN SALT IN! I really don't understand why someone actually suggested that...<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|o6BDapZjaa	Well water can have all kinds of minerals in it.  I'd stick with distilled water or bottled drinking water from a store.|`|AA11708471	he is not well because Bettas need 5+ gallon heated and filtered aquariums not bowls<br>  bowls are animal cruelty|`|gpVSRFuOaa	Thats not good at all! You must buy water conditioner. and ocean salt from the pet store to healthy up the water! Also a filter would be very helpful. if you get a filter, use it, Also, dont change the entire tank only half so the bacteria in there can benifit the fish and have healthy scales! Good luck!|`|JaFbuUUWaa	I use dugout water and it's fine, but I do use Cycle and AquaPlus in it. As long as you are using those your water should be ok. You can get medicine for fin rot.|`|1orBemFyaa	i dont think so, well water comes from the water table which is from rain, which is veryy good for fish.  but bad germs may have gotten in.  im not sure how sanitary wells are.  best of luck!|`|1YNhKzeqaa	1. Well water can contain bacteria that are bad for your fish, and a de-chlorinator would just get rid of any chlorine that keeps the bacteria in check. Use different water.<br>  <br>  2. Be sure to use aquarium salt in your water, it is specially for fresh water fish. NOT marine salt.<br>  <br>  3. Don't keep a beta in a bowl. Betas require filtration, swimming room and a heater, none of which can be accomplished with a bowl. Betas need their water to be around 72 degrees Fahrenheit, they are tropical fish. The loss of appetite and lethargy can be caused by the low water temperature as fish are cold blooded.|`|R4IWxA0Xaa	I don't know. you could buy something to make the water better. maybe a testing kit or something

Unfortunately, I never do get to actually see him do it, but I'd hear him do it all the time!!  LOL.  That's too funny :o)  He must be an extra friendly fish; you are lucky!  Enjoy him!!|`|RGqs6ySGaa	bettas are actually very interesting and curious fish. They enjoy watching humans go about their day and you can even teach them how to play peek-aboo! i play it with one of my bettas. he was probably just wanting to play around with you or just watching you.|`|33oAfqGnaa	Oh he's playing. When young Betta's are usually very active fish.<br>  or do you have a mirror to close because if a male betta sees another male betta or even his own reflection he may attack towards the fish.

n4pzdQW1aa	Absolutely. I'm in school right now for a vet assistant and we have to opportunity to learn about a wide variety of animals. Last semester we learned about specific horse breeds and how they tick. In the next two weeks we get to put that knowledge to use at a horse stable. With all this practice with horses when I graduate I can work specifically work with horses. Also In my in my area, or rather at the school I'm at, they offer equestrian classes dedicated to learning even more about horses.
1d9TrIKCaa	okay wow the people here suck and don't understand logic at all. No she shouldn't have just gotten a dog, it sounds like she just wants one to be an agility type dog, and if she is low energy, will not be able to do that.  Yeah she sounds like a brat and i don't think she'll be able to deal with it|`|PM23RDycaa	Does it matter? Its not your problems its her parents problem since they let her get it.

Plus, its usually the family (parents) that end up dealing with the dog anyways|`|0uqsaxEqaa	I would hope that you friend's parents are a bit more responsible than to let her get a dog just because you wanted one!

dlUof4cnaa	first of all congrats on deciding to get such a wonderful pet!!! <br>  <br>   i suggest that the dog and the gerbils are kept separate, as the sight of the dog would petrify the gerbils, keep them away from the source of barking ie the dog and the place that he/she barks!!!!<br>  <br>  watch out for any obvious signs of stress, them having diarrhoea, them frantically washing their faces, them squeaking!!!!<br>  <br>  as long as you moniter them and love them the should be fine!!|`|v3dN1sSaaa	well it wouldn't really affect it the gerbil i wouldn't think but maybe it would be a little bit noisy when they just want peace, so maybe it would be a better idea if you kept the dog away from the gerbils and try to limit its barking because then everyone would be happy :)<br>  good luck<br>  and hope i helped<br>  <br>  (by the way someone else put this called rainbowbbe and that was me because i forgot my password and now i remembered it so i am back on this one so that was my answer not someone else)|`|nNzR3xejaa	well it wouldn't really affect it the gerbil i wouldn't think but maybe it would be a little bit noisy when they just want peace, so maybe it would be a better idea if you kept the dog away from the gerbils and try to limit its barking because then everyone would be happy :)<br>  good luck <br>  and hope i helped|`|4M6RSigmaa	I have gerbils and my dog does the same things. Keep the gerbils somewhere the dog isnt allowed or away from doors/windows. If anything the barking would frighten them.

OyNJTWaiaa	There is a condition called french moult where budgies do not either develop or keep some of their flight feathers. These birds cannot fly and are often called "runners". Spread out her wings and examine the flight feathers and see what she has of them...if they are all there and looking healthy, or some missing and others looking raggedy. Any tail feathers missing ? <br>  Apart from french moult...if she has all her flight and tail feathers and is healthy feather wise, then the other reason could be she was clipped before she learnt to fly as a youngster, and if kept in a cage without room to fly and build up muscle she will then be unable to fly. If you can take a photo of her wings outstretched showing her flight feathers and send to me I can advise if she is a french moult survivor. <br>  Believe me a lot of french moult birds are sold in petshops and petshop staff say they have clipped them, but the bird actually didnt develop the feathers in the first place due to french moult...<br>  Its only when you are expecting the new feathers to grow in and they dont, or they break off, that you realise there is something not quite right.|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	she probably doesnt know how to fly. she must of not been exposed to the sky and so you cant really expect her to fly at all, unless you somehow figure out a way to temp her to use her wings. check her out with the vet to see if anything is wrong with the wings but i doubt its the wings. i would say its more of a mental situation.|`|gpVSRFuOaa	Is this the first time she's been out of her cage? If so, she is just new to the unknown envirnment. All you can do is let her out more often, give her a boost, a light jerking motion, if her wings are healthy, she'll learn. On the other hand, if her wings were damaged in the process of clipping, which i find very sad that birds dont have the privelage to even keep their beautiful feathers...., i'd go see a vet or take her in a cage to the pet store and see what they say. Dont worry, i just let my birds out for the first time, and they were hiting the walls really hard! They just don't know better, so dont worry. Check for any signs of unhealthyness or strange behavior. Good luck!|`|AA11707728	The reason is simple.....she's too fat, flabby and out of shape to fly.  The muscles necessary have completely atrophied because she has sat in a cage most of her life.  Her body is the consistency of veal.<br>  <br>  With enough effort and time spent out of the cage, she probably could develop those muscles enough to fly again....but it would require alot of effort on her part and alot of falling and bumping into things.|`|fyLgyLc8aa	does she have a disease?  maybe ask the pet store u bought her from.  Does she have her wings clipped?  these are all things you should consider.  If u r really worried, ask a specialized vet.|`|6GSxA9glaa	Look at your bird.  Does it have all of it's primary wing feathers?  If so then it should be able to fly.  Why are you taking your bird out doors and letting it out of it's cage?  This is very dangerous as a number of things can happen such as a slight breeze can carry off a small bird, even with clipped wings, and you may never see it again. Plus, there are many predators such as hawks, cats, dogs, etc..., that can grab your bird before you can do anything about it.  So if you want to teach it to fly it is best to do so indoors where you can keep your bird safe.<br>  <br>  Flying is the best exercise for a bird and will go a long way toward keeping your bird healthy and happy.  If you examine your birds wings and it is missing it's primaries after all this time then someone must have mutilated the birds wings when they clipped them and it will not be able to fly.
Ow2xyl9iaa	Well he does this because he loves you and misses you when your gone  That is a loyal and and true freind and  loving companion..... you have         and that is called unconditional love that our pets give us... if you think he is lonely ..then i am sure he is......When you are gone try puting on a radio with soft music and  or people talking  also if you want leave your  TV.on so he can hear people or the music will keep him calm and not so alone seeing you cannot get another cat .........AND by the way  you should keep him inside always as it is not safe for him to be outside with  coyotes in your neighbour hood   or and them killing other peoples cats........when outside they are subject to all the dangers and  diseases  and poisons outside...and other peoples  dogs................please don,t let him outside  if you truly love your preciou s kitty...........if you want to walk him  go buy a harness and teach him to walk with you outside........do,t buy a collar  it could chock him if he runs...the only thing that is safe to walk a cat is a  harness you cac measure around his waist and go to your pet shop and ask them to help you find the right size and take your measurement with you    and they will  hel you...........but the only way  he will be safe is inside .   and not outside  alone  day or night.......and he also could get lost........i hope i have been  of some help  to you...........good luck and  GOD BLESS  YOU AND YOUR KITTY AND MAY HE ALWAYS REMAIN SAFE FROM ALL HARM|`|aN4SUKkRaa	Once the cat works out how to open the catfood cans for himself he will ignore you completely!|`|Kz6QO1FWaa	maybe its that she loves you|`|7HEZhx46aa	I think when an abandoned animal like a dog or a cat is taken in by someone who cares (like you), they KNOW how lucky they are. They'll show their affection by doing the only thing they can, which, for a cat, is to rub all over you. (If they had arms, they would hug you).<br>  If you can't get him a cat-buddy, get him one of those "cat condos", with all kinds of cubby holes he can hide in. And get him toys. Many years ago, I used to leave the teevee on for my cat when I left for work every day. Then my sister came to visit, her kids fell in love with my kitty and because I always felt guilty about leaving him alone all day, I let my niece take him home with her -- all the way to North Carolina.|`|qI12jcVpaa	She misses you!

p7swtBYzaa	Dogs don't sweat - they can't, they don't have sweat glands like humans do.<br>  <br>  If your dog is wet, maybe she is drooling?  Look closer to see the source of the wetness.<br>  <br>  It is very unlikely that your dog caught anything from your mother, most illnesses are definitely not species transferable.|`|jUnFWPpuaa	Dogs do not have sweat glands. That is why dogs pant. That is how they cool themselves down. This worries me. If your dog is wet, then there is another reason for it. We did have one case where a dog came in that was released fluid through her skin around her belly. I heard all of the doctors say that they had no idea what was wrong with her and they sent her to a specialist out of state. They also said that it was the first case like that that any of them had ever seen. I hope that your dog is ok. Good luck.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Dogs cant sweat, so I am not sure what you are describing.<br>  Most diseases do not pass from human to dog (or vice versa)|`|zcdqZ4wOaa	May be.

7SyCZnM9aa	Just make sure the introduction is gradual and not just throw them in the same room and expect them to get along. Make sure you give both plenty of attention and treats when they are together, to make sure they associate each others presences with good things. Make sure you provide an escape route for the cat just in case though.|`|OYouFVbHaa	yea i think they wiilll be fine most are and if you the cat and dog are around the same age they will like grow up with each other and get along better as they get to know each othere more lol|`|AA11487637	Yes dogs and cats get along all the time, many times my cats would sleep next to my golden retriever, it is better if they know each other when they're little|`|bK8EDYLaaa	yeah my dogs and cats are bffs they sleep in the same bed!! don't worry about if the cat doesn't like the dog it will just stay away from it|`|ZU7nz2N5aa	If they are introduced at a young age and grow up in each others company.|`|2ooVy6gsaa	ya totally ! a dog and a cat can get along well if the kitty is nice...lol|`|Nlsijci6aa	uh yeh suh|`|fe992osaaa	yes they can some do and some dont i have a cat & a dog and they get along just just fine but when i had my other cat who past i november, didnt like the cat or the dog soo hope tjis helps ( :|`|03b5f9141419ea0eae2aa5d9d3ea728baa	i've had lots of dogs and cats that have gotten along|`|sTodQmGaaa	Yes!<br>  When i got my kitten, my dog (who was around 5 years old at the time) loved my kitten, they were best friends i swear! they would sleep next to eachother and always chase eachother (in a friendly way) they were great! just make sure the dog isnt too big|`|OrvTG44laa	Yeah, a lot of dogs and cats get along.

AA12308199	he could have a bladder infection.  talk to the vet about it.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	He just had SURGERY a WEEK ago! He's still recovering! Tell your parents to lighten up.|`|3d4XE1Keaa	I don't think they could have made a mistake.  When a dog gets neutered, all the "work" is done on the testicles themselves.  No surgery is done up inside the dog where the bladder or anything are, unless the dog is what they call "chryptorchid."  Which means the testicles haven't dropped down outside the body.  Not sure if I spelled that right or not, but you get the idea.  <br>  <br>  He could be peeing for many reasons.  Hold old is he?  Some dogs pee as a sign of submission.  Like when people come home and the dog is so excited and they pee everywhere.  Have you called your vet to ask what they think?  It doesn't cost anything to ask over the phone.|`|tdJ1wE7daa	That happened to my female. I think her bladder may have been damaged when she was fixed, but for females it is much more invasive, I don't know what they could have done to a male to make him do that, but anyway, my dog is now on medication for it and it seems to work. She has to take it weekly. Its like $1 per pill.

a115d141ee91d817492c69035423f958aa	If you are buying them together that is easy, if you already have one and looking to purchase a second one, you will need an extra cage for a while. You let them socialize outside of their cages, while you supervise. When you see that they are no longer attacking eachother, and just hanging out, then you can try putting them in one cage, again gradually with supervision.<br>  <br>  People will tell you if you get more then one that the birds will not bond with you, NOT TRUE!!! If you take the time and let them out of their cage and let them sit around you while you watch TV, read, etc, and you give them treats, they will both bond with you and consider you part of their flock.|`|691YPESOaa	I wouldn't do that if I were you.|`|6GSxA9glaa	You did not explain your situation.  Do you have an existing male and you want to add another?  If so, then this is a bad idea.  Birds can become very possessive of their cages and adding a strange bird to another adult bird's cage can lead to fighting which could result in injury or death.  <br>  <br>  Also, when two birds are housed together they may bond with each other and your companion may want nothing else to do with you so instead of gaining an extra companion you lose the one you lose the one you already have.<br>  <br>  I am not saying it is impossible to house two birds together, but you are playing russian roulette every time you do this.
1YNhKzeqaa	Many tetras are generally cheap, colorful, and guppy-sized. But are not live bearers<br>  <br>  Danios are also cheaper than guppies (unless you are looking at the neon colored glo-fish variety which will run you about $6 ea.) and there is a variety called veil-tail that has pretty flowy fins, but they aren't as colorful. Not live bearers.<br>  <br>  Platys are live bearers, a little larger than guppies. Like guppies, they are less likely to eat your live plants. However, telling their gender is not quite as obvious as it is with the guppies and swordtails. Around the same price as guppies.<br>  <br>  Swordtails are live bearers, but much larger than guppies, they don't usually eat your live plants, but some may. Males have a pointy "sword" on the bottom of their tails while females do not. Around the same price as guppies.<br>  <br>  Mollies are live bearers, but prefer slightly brackish water. They are about the same size as swordtails, but like the platys gender differences aren't too obvious. Mollies are most likely of the live bearers to eat up your live plants. Around the same price as guppies.|`|zqVDJxUIaa	Platies are also livebearers (don't lay eggs). They grow to a similar size compared to the guppy, and have the same water conditions/temperature needs. The nicer platies are a bit more expensive that the guppy, but not by much. Platies reproduce just as much as guppies do! Platies will eat the same food as guppies.<br>   Platy Info and pictures: <br>  <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/Profiles-Platy.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/Profiles-Platy.h...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|X48z0Lwwaa	A Platy is very similar to a guppy but doesn't have the big fanned tail.|`|JEaTBC8Vaa	tetras|`|944iJNAdaa	Guppies are livebearers, and easy to raise (thus, cheap).  Other livebearers include Platy's, Swordtails, and Mollies (mollies are a little harder to raise).  The very cheapest livebearers can be found free for the taking sometimes, they're used for mosquito control in ditches and ponds in numerous parts of the country "mosquito fish", or Gambusia affinis, and I've netted them up by the hundreds on occasion.|`|MYhQqeV7aa	I like neon tetras. Their flashy color is nice, they like to swim together, and they seem to get along with guppies.
283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	ask if you could take the bird to the neighbor's house. My uncle used to watch my bird all the time and they became great buddies. It really put my mind at ease knowing that there was someone watching him just in case anything happened. My uncle did not have any pets of his own and he admitted that he really enjoyed the bird's company!|`|vMByDy1raa	The bird will be a little stressed maybe leave a tv on for company.  Make sure he has shredding toys in the cage to take his frustration out.  They have bird setters they cost $10 a day and you take them to their house.  Our exotic bird shop has recommendations for sitters.  I left mine for two nights and he was fine.  The only thing I would be worried about is if he poop in his water or food and it got containment.  The bird won't die but you may have a very upset bird when you come back.|`|OyNJTWaiaa	How easy would it be to take the bird in cage with food to a neighbours house, a friend, or relative. No trouble at all for anyone minding the bird. Such an easy solution and you will feel better being away and the bird will get clean water and company.|`|gpVSRFuOaa	No worries! The bird will be fine! Fill up a big bowl of food and a tub of clean water and your fine! My birds go days without changed food and water because it lasts weeks! Same thing, except you wont see your birs. The bird will not die, thats a guarentee. No worries!:) If you want have a friend check up daily or something but its not needed:)|`|UETAqR8Taa	all would be okay except for the water. it can get poo in it, they wash in it. it truly should be changed daily|`|6KxBqnstaa	Here is what I do when have to leave. I fill two bowls with food as they do throw a lot of it out when eating. Nice big bowl of water. I cover cage half way and I leave a radio on for them so they have some noise and talking. Leave some treats on bottom of cage floor also. If you have a cell phone or your parents do and the bird is around the answering machine call and talk with him for a few each day so he hears your voice. :) Should be fine for 2-3 days no longer though with no one checking on him.|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	3 days you are fine, but any more is bad.|`|6GSxA9glaa	Three days is too long to leave a bird unattended.  Water needs to be changed as least once a day as bacteria levels will rise, especially if you have a dunk-er or a bird that relieves itself in it's water dish.  Trying to compensate with a larger water dish can also be dangerous if the bird has enough room in which to drown itself.<br>  <br>  I would convince your mother to let the neighbor in, tell her they can bring in the mail and newspaper while you are gone so that burglars will not realize you are away.  If your mother still does not agree then maybe your neighbor would be willing to bird sit at their house?|`|XbOrBBMbaa	Well. When I go on vacation I do the same thing with my pets. I leave them food and water. Your bird will learn to entertain himself thoses couple of days you will be gone. As long as he has food and water I'm sure he will be fine.  I bet you have never left him alone before. This feeling is completely normal. I felt the same thing. I just couldn't afford to put my two dogs in a dog hotel and I don't like the thought of them in cages. But your bird lives in a cage lol and I'm 100% sure that your bird will be fine. This bird is lucky to have a mom to care for him so much. (:<br>  <br>  Hope this helped. <br>  I feel your pain. Stay strong.|`|b1xnoBSiaa	Three days is too long with stale water. Our birds dunk their food or just drop seed shells in it and it needs to be changed every day. <br>  <br>  If you have some sort of a watering contracption, that is different. But <br>  also if her food gets water in it or she accidently poops in it, she will not eat from that bowl. <br>  <br>  We alsways have someone come and check on our birds or take them to a friends when we are gone, even for two days.  Your parents don't want to check on your bird? I would take it to a neighbor's or friends.|`|xJMhQAhfaa	It would not be my preference to leave a bird alone for 3 days.<br>  The water is a concern. I agree with the other poster about the dangers of leaving a large amount of water.  If you are concerned about neighbors, how about a friend? When I leave, I have a friend come by in the morning and evening. I leave instructions and baggies for each day with a measured amount of food and treats in each baggie, so in the morning, they can uncover the birds, dump the old food, dump the baggie of food in the dish, clean and change the water and go. Then in the evening, cover the bird and go. I would also leave a radio on a soft music station, volume low while your gone.<br>  Another consideration is to call your avian vet (I am assuming you have one) and ask if they board birds or can recommend a reputable boarder.<br>  When I lived in California, there was a great place I used. Now that I live in another state, I've not found a good boarder, but I use the reliable friend, option.
2ZsXQIuwaa	get a can, such as a soda can or a beer can, whichever you have and perfer.<br>  fill it with 10-12 pennies and tape it shut. whenever your dog starts barking his head off shake the can and get his attention. when he stops reward and treat. say "good dog!!" and give him high praises. continue till he knows that being quiet is better than barking.<br>  <br>  occupy his time. he's probably just bored because he has nothing to do. give him a good chew toy or play outside with him till he tire out. a sleeping dog doesnt bark, unless you have a sleep talker XD i like to fill kongs with peanut butter. it lasts for hours<br>  <br>  try wearing him out mentally too. train him trick and give him obsticales to go through. keep both his mind and body busy and you'd probably get a much quieter dog.<br>  <br>  <br>  more walks, more lessons, more sterness = a nicely behaved dog without behavior issues, meaning no barking<br>  <br>  but remember, he wont just stop barking. he's still bark. but it would be less consistant and he'd only bark when he needs to, not when he's bored.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	she must hear something but you can stop it simply but stopping her say no and dont' run aournd the house with her that is what she wants and she'll do it everytime that is offereing her something good she wants. period. see dog whisperer.|`|tFMnB4DIaa	she is probably just getting to the stage where she is REALLY getting to know you and wants to protect you.... girl dogs are actually more aggressive then boy dogs|`|pcUAErpQaa	Try to Socialize with her. Check outside and inside ur house. My dog barks when I knock any door and if some dude walks on the street.|`|0uqsaxEqaa	This has just started happening recently? Did anything change in the household, routine or anything else in January? Or in your neighbours' routines?  What exactly does she do when she's barking - is she leaping around excitedly, or is she fixed on say a door or window and barking at it.<br>  <br>  From what you have said she could be doing either of two things - seeking attention or guard barking. If the former you are doing exactly what she wants you to do by chasing her etc. I would say ignore her completely, but I have to think of your neighbours, as well as you, putting up with the noise. Don't chase her, don't touch her, and tell her NO very firmly, then ignore her. When she stops, and stays stopped for a few seconds praise her profusely, and maybe give her a treat to start with so that she associates being quiet with something good happening. Alternatively, if you think it is guard barking, you could try distracting her with a toy to give her something else to think about.<br>  <br>  It might be worth having her checked over by a vet, particularly if this problem has started suddenly, and taking her to training classes is never a bad idea.
IrdZKYT3aa	Let him settle in, being shipped and put into a new home is very stressful for the little guys, he won't eat any different than other bettas.<br>  If you're worried, contact the seller and ask what they fed him.  If it was from a professionalnal breeder, he may be used to live food.   Or try offering frozen of freeze dried food instead of the pellets.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|3n60UxgQaa	Give him about 4 days to adjust.  Because of the fact that you just got him, he's probably still a little unsure about where he is.  When he's like that, safety comes first.  Once he knows he's safe, he'll start eating. =]|`|33oAfqGnaa	what do you feed him the pellets? <br>  try some live food, if you go to a pet shop that sells brine shrimp ask for a sample of 5 individual shrimp. Take them home and try feeding.<br>  Also he is probably still adjusting to the water so if you give him a couple days he will probably be in tip-top shape.
QMupt401aa	Well you can have a check up at the vet that might cost about 50|`|6W4ZWOetaa	Hey there!<br>  It sounds like it could be one of a few things.  Your rat could have an allergy to something in his bedding or food.  <br>  <br>  Also, he could be getting too much protein in his diet.<br>  <br>  It could also be mites.  He doesn't need to be in contact with any other animal for this to happen.<br>  <br>  I would suggest taking him to the vet, I've never had to spend more than $80 on a rat visit to the vet that wasn't for surgery.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope he feels better soon!|`|gpVSRFuOaa	um, if he rolls in a ball, he may have scratched something, my hamster bled a little from rolling in the ball, so its probably ok.

Shouldnt cost too much. good luck!|`|cc8Jl3Lwaa	Im guessing he has a rash or he just simply scratched it too hard. A vet cost would be at the price range of free to 100 dollars, for me it was 30 dollars. Maybe his skin got caught into something on your cage. Observe your rat throughout the day/night. I dont suggest you take it to the vet but if this problem pursues then visit the vet ASAP. Hopefully he will heal.|`|4f9013b2cc226802e89e2f659281cb46aa	It means your rat is hurting itself. It could be caused by big changes such as new food, cage, anything. Or not enough attention. The vet will just end up making the rat worse. Just keep a close eye. and fix some stuff
d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	The goal of the kitten series is to help build her immunity as the maternal antibodies fade.<br>  <br>  Why do kittens require a series of vaccinations?<br>  <br>  Kittens receive antibody from colostrum (the first milk the mother produces) that is ingested during the early hours after birth. Maternal antibody helps protect against infectious disease until the kitten's own immune system is more mature.<br>  <br>  "... veterinarians often administer a series of vaccines, usually beginning when the kitten is around six to eight weeks of age, and then repeating vaccination at three or four week intervals until maternal antibody has waned, usually at around twelve weeks of age. In some cases (e. g., rabies vaccines) the initial vaccine is not given until maternal antibody has disappeared."|`|s3Zbnj77aa	Cat only need a few vaccines when they are young and then they should be good for a while. They are pretty important, though!<br>  <br>  If money is a concern, check out www.banfield.com <br>  <br>  If they have a clinic in your area, they accept walk ins Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2-4pm. During this time, they will not charge you for the office visit, just the vaccines you need. They will still do a full examination, so it's a great deal! Be sure to ask them which vaccines are REQUIRED/ HIGHLY recommended, if money is a big concern, because they will try and convince you to get more than you may need.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AJxl0IvHaa	Jen is right.<br>  But look... vaccines are supposed to be given in a certian time.<br>  If they need to be 2 weeks apart, thats what needs to be done. even one week later,  then the affect of the shot is over with.<br>  You wasted your money :(<br>  But talk to the vet... he may tell you something about this.<br>  But some people dont even give their cats shots...<br>  Some believe shots can make pets sick.<br>  Google what vaccines REALLY do to your pets.<br>  I keep all my pets UTD on shots though.|`|srjPOxW7aa	If your cat stays indoors and isn't around any other kitty that comes in and out of the house. Your cat should be fine. But it is in the cats best interest to have it done, because it's inevitable that she will accidentally get out one day and it's very possible for her to get something. I have rescued several (100's) of cats (plus other animals) through the years and the initial vaccines in their youth are important to have for their  maintenance of health. I understand the financial issue and you may get all sorts of help through rescue organizations .

Breads/wheat and white chicken is best. Also, you can feed him rice.

A little canned pumpkin (not the spicy kind that you would put in a pie, just plain pumpkin) will also help tremendously.<br>  <br>  Many vets recommend Science Diet, which is a horrible food.

qmEitkZ2aa	There is a chance that the mother will not take the kittens back if you have handled them too much while they are so young. They won't smell the same to her. But definitely still worth a try. If they continue to refuse food, especially the sick one, take them to a shelter. Even if they have to be put down, it's better than having them starve.|`|ql7fDxI5aa	buy some carrots, potatoes, and celery. Throw vegetables plus three kittens and some salt in a pot, slow cook and stir until a stew forms. Serves 5.|`|OrvTG44laa	The mother might have left to go get food.  I suggest watching over the babies, but  the mother might come back.  If you're sure she isn't, you first need to take them to the vet.  They could have fleas, ticks and diseases.  Get them checked out to make sure they are safe.  You need to buy a kitten formula, which your vet can probably give you.  You also need to rub their genitals to make them pee or poop.  I've cared for a kitten, and they are very delicate with their food.  You need to follow strict rules when you're caring for them.|`|7Fc22teCaa	I found a new born kitten, rode down the highway with him sittin in my shirt pocket.

The mother will most likely come looking for them late in the night.  Disturbing them was a big mistake.  If you don't feel comfortable putting them back outside, then you should set a trap out in the same area.  Hopefully you'll catch the mother and can reunite them.  Then, you can take all three kittens and their mother to a shelter where they can be appropriately cared for, vaccinated, spayed/neutered and found permanent homes.<br>  <br>  Do not skip school tomorrow.  Finding 3 kittens is not a legitimate excuse to miss school.  Let an adult take care of them.  If no one can do that, then take the kittens to a shelter.

Nzb5QmNXaa	First, your tank is too small. That common will get over a foot long and is best left in a pond. The fin tail is a veil tail. You need at least 35 gallons for one goldfish and 10 gallons for each additional goldfish. This means you need at least a 55 for them. If you plan on keeping the common, then you will need to move it to a 55 gallon on its own.<br>  <br>  Second, you should never mix fast swimming varieties with slow swimming varieties. The faster common will nip the other two's fins and tail and could eventually kill them.<br>  <br>  Third, your tank is probably suffering from several things: lack of oxygen, ammonia poisoning, and nitrite poisoning. You can fix these things by doing several small water changes (10%). Make sure that you use water conditioner each time. Do two 10% water changes as soon as possible. Don't do more than 10% at once as you may kill your fish if you haven't been doing weekly water changes. Tomorrow, do two more 10% water changes and do it again the next day. Don't forget the water conditioner.<br>  <br>  As soon as you can, get a filter that is rated for 30+ gallons. You should always over-filtrate with goldfish. Also get an air pump, air tubing, and some sort of air stone/wand/decor. This will help with oxygen levels in your tank.<br>  <br>  You should do 25% water changes starting next week. Do it at least once a week for the life of your fish.<br>  <br>  Good luck
owLAmQqjaa	I would advise against the idea of an exercise ball for a hedgehog. While running wheels are necessary, they are also safe since they have a solid plastic or metal base. Balls on the other hand have air slits in them to let air in, and these pose a risk to injuring the hedgehogs delicate feet.<br>  <br>  If you want your hedgehog to get exercise outside of his cage, I would instead suggest hedgie proofing a room, by which I mean blocking off any small spaces he could fit into or any ledges he could fall off of, and also remove anything that he might try to eat. Exercise pens also work well, just try to find some without large spaces he could get his head stuck in.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZdQtNNI9aa	The giant one that is for chinchillas.
PHOyKsmPaa	You can not own a wolf unless you were to have a special wildlife permit. You THINK it would be fun, but trust me, you do not want to own a wolf.  In many states even owning a wolf hybrid that is more than 75% wolf is illegal.  They are dangerous.|`|HEDSOHq1aa	Wolves aren't pets<br>  most wolves as pets end up dead, sold or released back into the wild|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	It is illegal to own an endangered species without a permit. Besides, grey wolves are pack animals. They are unhappy without others of their kind. Even if you did have a permit to own a wolf, you would be better off having more than two. In addition, wolves are wild animals and are very capable of killing their human caretakers. Have you ever read Call of the Wild or White Fang by Jack London? The wolves in those books picked off humans for food. A wolf could do the same to you even if it isn't for food.<br>  <br>  In short, you cannot and should not get a grey wolf|`|OrvTG44laa	Why would you want one?  Wolves aren't dogs.  They need to live in packs, so you can't just get one.  They need acres of land, not just a large yard.  If this animal got out, it would be killed by a neighbor or the police.  Wolves are very dominant dogs and will always try to take over.  You never actually fully establish dominance.  They are strong, and can easily kill you.  You need a very, very high fence that goes very deep into the ground.|`|Q0R8XkZTaa	why? you should let the poor animal live in the wild...
rWGzVUxOaa	I am not sure how this could have happened b/c the trip from one tank to the other should have been around 15 seconds at most.  You should make sure the temperature in the new tank is the same as the old one and that the water parameters (ammonia nitrate nitrtite...) are at an acceptable level.  Other than that just keep an eye on him and if it seems to get worse I would try moving it back to the other tank for a bit to see if it gets better.|`|p3rnyBoYaa	I am looking forward to that answer as well. I will be moving my fish in the spring and would like to keep them as calm as possible. I have a pleco as well.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	What did you do???? Grab him by his tail and swing him around and then threw him into the tank???????<br>  <br>  Just do it as quick as you can, with a net large enough and lots of stress coat.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!!!|`|3WD4ItHXaa	At this point, there isnt too much u can do, but wait it out. you could add extra water contitioner, or some stress zyme. But thats about it. My plecho did that when he was ill, but he pulled through it, he is probably just stressed out. Give him some time.

It isn't uncommon for this to happen. Wait to see if the swelling goes down. Depending on the vaccine you should most likely do an extended protocol (3 year vs 1 year) for that vaccine, or have your vet premed(give it a shot of antihistamine and/or steroid) prior to giving that vaccine. If it is a non-core vaccine it would be a good idea to discontinue it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Merial is the maker of the vaccine that your cat was given. You're cat was given the Purevax rabies vaccine, which is actually is specially formulated in a way that is less likely to produce cancerous growths. If you are very worried you can go to another vet and get a second opinion|`|srjPOxW7aa	Yes if your nervous about it, you should to help ease your conscious and possibly help your cat if there's really an issue there.
M9o5WpOqaa	It probably goes something like this:<br>  <br>  You are a cute,fuzzy little baby,all snuggled up w/your mama and brothers & sisters,thinking everything is great.Then all of a sudden,you are being picked up and placed in this cold,dark place (cardboard box) and are shifting around in that dark,bumpy place (car ride) to this large,scary place with big scary people and foreign animal sounds,and you are placed inside this tiny little glass thing (pet shop aquarium) and just left there.How sad,you didn't even get a chance to say goodbye!<br>  Now what?? You're terribly frightened,but at least you're alone in this place.Yeah,it could be cozy in here,and at least you have a good view.You get all settled in and make a nest in the little plastic house the store provided you with...all is well...until one day another fuzzy thing gets plopped in this big glass scary place with you.He is mean,and tries to fight you for food.After trying to fend off this bully,you decide that you need to make the best of it and try to become friends,well maybe just civil cagemates for now.A few days pass and you are becoming used to the little kids smooshing their noses up against your little home.And you have no privacy at that-kids even watch you poop! Then all of a sudden,this BIG,SCARY hand comes out of nowhere and scoops you up and again puts you inside that same scary dark place.Once again,you didn't have the chance to say goodbye to your last room mate! The car ride is extremely loud-as that "mom" thing is yelling at her "smaller" things to be quiet!!<br>  Now you are again taken out of that dark scary place and plopped into the COOLEST,MOST AWESOME house ever! You have tunnels and tubes,a wheel,treats,and little lookouts,and your OWN food bowl.Wow-this is really cool! Then this tiny little hand scoops you out of your warm nest and gently kisses you on your little nose and calls you "Hammie" or Fluffy,or whatever...You soon realize that you like this attention.You are finally HOME to stay!|`|PTKiTblZaa	it sux

Also, you could look at the instruction manual, if you got one, and see if it talks about the collar randomly beeping like it is.|`|wdKsVqbnaa	I have an invisible fence, and the only time that the collar beeps, is after a year of use, when the battery is going dead.  Try putting in a new battery, and if the beeping still doesn't stop, the collar must be defective.  As long as it's beeping, don't let the dog wear it!  It's confusing her, and she won't know when to stop at the yard boundary.
eQb93YoOaa	Hey! I work at PetCo....Don't worry about the newspaper! it wont hurt her at all! All small animals have the urge to chew.To prevent him/her from chewing on the paper why don't you go to your local pet supplier and get some guinea pig chew sticks...They taste like oranges and it will satisfy his/her urge for chewing! Also the chew sticks will prevent you from taking her to the vet to get her teeth trimmed that could turn into  health risks. Same with all small animals like rats, rabbits, gerbils...<br>  <br>  If you want to use a bedding use carefresh!  its biodegradable and flush able, its also made out of recycled cardboard so it dose not have any harmful chemicals or oils that would hurt your furry friend! It absorbs 3 times its weight in liquid so it last along time. i have a small gerbil and it last me about 2 weeks and i still don't smell a thing! Its a great bedding to use and i would not recommend anything else but this! this is the safest and warmest thing out there! -- Remember if you would not use it, don't give it to your pet!<br>  <br>  I hope I helped you out! Good luck!|`|oNHtVHzsaa	my guinea pig used to do that all the time and my bunny now does it. it's nothing to worry about, she probably is just trying to re-arrange her bedding. if you put the bedding in the shredder before u give it to her, it allows her to move it around at her own needs. thats what i do. im not sure about the windex vinegar, i don't think it could hurt her but i would just make sure that it doesn't get in the food and water. otherwise ur doing a great job on food and everything else. good luck and hope this helps.|`|vooQPKTdaa	firstly news paper is bad because of the ink, try paper towel or or toilet paper secondly dont give your guinea pig fruits and veggies to often every 2-3 days and wash the container with warm water and a bit of baking soda them rinse completely and let it air dry =]<br>  and maybe get it a cage|`|TeJU7MQ4aa	She probably is eating it,because thats what guinea pigs do,they graze.You should have shavings in her cage,some hay is ok,she'll eat it.You can line the bottom with the newspaper but I'd put shavings in,no dusty shavings,no cedar,both of those will give her respitory problems,I use Aspen,it smells good and its not dusty.|`|3C06kNGuaa	She's probably just playing with it.  Do you have toys in the cage for her?  Perhaps she's bored.  If not she might be just using that to make a comfortable bed/nest for herself.  Do you have any other fluffy material in there for her to nestle in?  Those two might help, but really ripping the newspaper shouldn't be unhealthy for her... hopefully she's not eating it. :)|`|PB5IRRclaa	all your guinea pig is doing is shes teething cause her teeth might sometimes get to big if she doesnt do that her teeth can get to big and they wont be able to fit in her mouth. if you can give her a wooden block or a role of tolet paper and yes its good for her .<br>  <br>  p.s. she is not eating it.|`|JAKpHhQCaa	Your guinea pig could be eating the newspaper but i highly doubt it. Guinea pigs tend to nibble at many things but they dont really eat it. I would use woodshavings as a bedding and then you wont have to clean out the cage so often, and I don't think it is as messy. I have three guinea pigs which are all adorable!!!

In my case, I have a rescue cat and two ragdolls, selected as companions for the rescue cat who is very anxious and needs company when I am not at home.  I had tried another rescue cat with her, but it was a complete disaster.  I chose ragdolls because they are bred for calm, friendly temperaments which I thought would go well with my rescue cat, and because they are generally very healthy. There are a couple of genetic diseases in ragdolls, but they are very rare (unlike some breeds like persians) and can be screened for and totally avoided.<br>  <br>  I love ragdolls because they are so friendly and gentle.  They are almost doggy in some ways, and they just love to hang out with you and sleep on the bed with you if you let them.  They are quite smart and determined, too, but they don't bite or scratch and are easy to handle even if you are picking them up when they don't want to be, for instance if they are doing something naughty.  They are so friendly, in fact, that you can't let them roam free, because they may try to make friends with a dog or a stranger who means harm rather than running away.<br>  <br>  You need to groom, even though their fur is less knotty than a persian's, to avoid digestive blockages from the cat swallowing too much fur.  Ragdolls can also have sensitive stomachs, but I find that  high fibre "hairball" food and being very gradual with food changes reduces problems.  If you get a Ragdoll, make sure the breeder screens his or her breeding cats for a heart disease called HCM, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and hasn't had any cats with hip dysplasia or kidney problems.  These are all very rare in ragdolls.<br>  <br>  The other breeds you asked about are all really good. Abyssinians are beautiful and very smart and active, so you need to give them lots to do.  Birmans are usually very quiet, placid cats but need the same level of grooming as ragdolls, and Norwegians can be a bit wary of people - they are very handsome and have awesome long tails, though.  I think Abys also sometimes have an inherited eye problem and they can be prone to anxiety that needs drug treatment, but birmans and wegies are usually healthy cats.|`|nQdGGBN4aa	Best "breed" to get is either a DLH or a DSH<br>  <br>  DLH - Domestic Long Hair<br>  <br>  DSH - Domestic Short Hair<br>  <br>  Okay, those are breeds - my point is, if you are thinking of getting a cat as a companion, you need not worry about the breed.<br>  <br>  No one breed makes a better companion than any other breed.<br>  <br>  There are hundreds of cats put to death every week in every town and city simply because they don't have a home.<br>  <br>  If you are thinking about getting a cat, go to the Humane Society, ASPCA, or pounds and find yourself a great friend.<br>  <br>  If you are thinking of getting a cat and are basing the decision upon what the cat will look like - get a painting of a cat, hang it on your wall, and stare at it from time to time.<br>  <br>  Basing the decision to get a cat solely upon appearance is wrong.<br>  <br>  Taking a cat into your life is a huge act which makes you responsible for the cat for the rest of its life.<br>  <br>  Base the decision upon how the cat reacts and interacts with you.<br>  <br>  If you are thinking of breeding cats - don't.<br>  <br>  There are already far too many unwanted kittens and cats.|`|CvsrmBn6aa	Ooooh..my fave is a POlydactyl!<br>  But my 2nd fave is...FROM A SHELTER!
Eyawiwc5aa	Even w/ a "baby" iguana you should not use anything smaller then a 55gallon tank. Smaller the tank you can not process the correct temps nor provide the ig the space he/she needs. Trust me you dont want to start off w/ a 20-30gallon w/in 2-3months youll be moving the ig, less stress on the ig and yourself if you start w/ the 55gallon or larger to begin w/. Moving an ig from space to space can for some igs cause stress.<br>  <br>  Things you need:<br>  * 55 gallon tank (will only last 8-10months of age)<br>  ** Enclosure needs to be at least 1.5-2 times it's total length ... an adult you will need a space of 6-7ft tall x 8-10ft long x 4ft wide.<br>  <br>  * newspaper and/or paper towels for floor covering <br>  ** Floor covering:<br>  BAD floor covering: bark, dirt, moss, sand, pellets are all bad ... at some point your iguana will try and lick swallow and then possibly cause blockage which will then need to be surgically removed or possibly death ... SAFE floor covering: newspaper (unprinted), paper towels, towels, vinyl flooring, indoor/outdoor carpeting - if you have any lose fibers from the carpeting or the towels please remove and replace - unprinted newspaper if you possibly can use is safer just in case your ig likes to try and eat the newspaper some ink may contain soy<br>  <br>  * hide box (some igs like some igs could care less about)<br>  <br>  * 2 water dishes (1 to drink from 1 to soak and possibly use for his/her potty area)<br>  <br>  * food dish (when you bring the ig home he/she may not care to eat for a while - some igs will eat after you switch to a heavy duty plastic lid - of course size of food also matters so may have to try different forms of food - meaning almost slush form, different sizes)<br>  <br>  * basking branch (make sure has a flat surface at the recommend UVB distance)<br>  <br>  * shop light for the UVB ... along w/ the proper wattages for domes for basking light and CHE<br>  <br>  * fake silk leaves (if the ig is trying to eat remove - try and get ones bigger then the ig)<br>  <br>  * thermometer w/ a probe at the end (about 2-3)<br>  <br>  * proper UVB (there is UVB on the market that does not provide the proper UVB for igs after about 100-150hrs of usage also some can cause eye damager - UVB will be listed below)<br>  <br>  * basking light (you can also use a house bulb instead of buying a basking bulb plus cheaper - in a 55gallon tank 60-75w usually will work but you need to make sure which works best for you)<br>  <br>  * CHE (ceramic heat emitter) for night time use (the colored bulbs for night can sometimes cause stress to some igs - the CHE's produce heat no light great for night time use if house drops below recommended igs temps for night)<br>  <br>  * a good herp/reptile vet that knows about iguanas <br>  ** find your state/country for herp/reptile vet: <a href="http://www.herpvetconnection.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.herpvetconnection.com/</a> - <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/vets/#vetlist" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/vets/#vetlist</a><br>  <br>  * daily to every other day bath tub soaking time - the ig will learn to go potty in water (why best to have 2 bowls for water)<br>  <br>  * some ppl use under tank heaters ... not required some do some dont ... its one of those if you want too's<br>  <br>  * timers for lights to turn on and turn off<br>  <br>  * keep a schedule .. when you feed, when bath, etc<br>  <br>  * think thats it other then knowing the proper diet for igs ... all that I can think of<br>  <br>  Temps:<br>  never let drop below 70F ...<br>  basking 92-96F if temp is too low digestion is slowed too high food digests too fast and nutrition is lost<br>  medium/middle (overall) 88-92F<br>  cool 75-84F<br>  at night 73-84F ... having a temp gun works the best to know what your igs body temp truly is.<br>  *** NO HEAT ROCKS PLEASE ... they can cause major burns on the under belly ... igs dont feel heat from below so they will sit there not knowing they are burning themselves ***<br>  - Depending on enclosure size, depends on wattage, but for basking light (along w/ UVB tube) you can use a house bulb for heat during the day, you don't have to use one of those costly basking bulbs you buy at the store (night if your house gets below 70 a CHE should be used - produces heat no light)<br>  - Stick on glass thermometers do not work, they can read incorrect, get a good thermometer w/ a probe at the end, and place where your iguana is basking under and at his/her level, you will get more of a correct temp reading<br>  Humidity:<br>  Iguanas are tropical and do need humidity.

My wife and I had an iguana and as much as we loved it, it was a terrible mistake. Here are some fun tidbits to consider: <br>  <br>  1. they never stop growing.   2. Because of #1 you should buy a 75 gallon tank, but you won't, but you'll end up buying one eventually 3. Their shedding is really annoying 4. They don't bite that often, they don't whip you with their tails that often, BUT they're nails scratch like needles and scar.  5. Eventually it'll get out of the tank and hide...for days.  I've found mine in one of my suits and in the bottom of a stereo speaker.  How did I find it?  Two ways: a. I set up a time lapse video camera because I got sick of him disappearing b. he loved pizza and when I would make it he would run out from wherever he was hiding.<br>  <br>  Which brings me to 6: they steal food they like worse than dogs.  When you eat, have a lemon wedge handy.  Iguanas hate lemons and if they bite you, you'll want to squeeze the lemon into its mouth instead of tear the iguana from your skin.  Think of a miniature pit bull.  When you pull at them, if they didn't release first, their razor sharp teeth are going to take a lot of skin with them.  <br>  <br>  With all of that said, we really loved our iguana. He only bit me twice and that was because I was teasing him to photograph him.  They only puff up, drop their dewlap and bob when they're pissed off (or if they see their reflection and think it's another iguana).  When you see that take a few steps back.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, go with a skink or a small dragon instead.  You'll be much happier.
70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	I would feed the pup four times a day until it is 8 weeks old,then you can reduce the feeding to three times a day and when the dog is 6 months old,twice a day.She should be fed twice daily for the rest of her life.<br>  <br>  Edit: The problem with leaving food down at all times for a puppy of this age is that you will never get it housebroken.Scheduled feeding will let you know that the puppy needs to go out right after it eats and again about 30 minutes later.If you leave food down all the time,the pup will be pooping all the time!|`|TWfDAYK4aa	I am not sure the milk is necessary, however, you would be better off using puppy formula or goat's milk.  Cow's milk is really not good for dogs.  Personally, I would just soak the puppy food in water for it.  And, I would suggest either Innova or Merrick dog foods instead of something like Dad's or the walmart brand.  <br>  As for feeding  the pup, at this age, I would give 4 small feedings a day.  By 8 or 9 weeks old, you should be able to cut back to 3 feedings, not feeding less, but feeding less often, if that makes sense.   By the time your pup is 5-6 months old, you should be able to cut it back to 2 feedings a day, feeding the appropriate amount of food for the size of you dog.  Best of luck with your puppy.|`|moIPv7pFaa	Pups that young should have access to softened food (puppy chow mixed with water or just regular oatmeal) and water available at all times. Since its so young it could get underfed or dehydrated easily. The oatmeal will help fill its belly up and keep it hydrated. If you don't want to leave food out for it all the time, I would offer food evey couple of hours or so. Leave the food down for a few minutes. If the pup starts eating, let it eat until its done. If not, take the food up and offer it later.|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	You need to feed her at least 4-5 times a day to keep the blood sugar levels stable at this age.  Just use small meals each time. If this puppy were still eating from Mom, he would eat all day off and on to regulate his blood sugar. You will need to do the same.|`|eDySIDPQaa	A pup this young needs food 4 times a day, and by 8 wks of age down to 3...then graduate at 16 wks to 2 times a day.<br>  <br>  you need to get some puppy formulated milk, regular milk is not good for a dog, it will give them the never ending poops.<br>  <br>  and get some good puppy food for the baby, no store bought brands at all<br>  <br>  You can a good puppy formula at Pets Mart and the puppy food, Blue Buffalo has a great puppy food,and you need to feed puppy food till is `1 yr old then graduate to adult food.<br>  <br>  good luck.....<br>  <br>  no canned food as well, it will give poops also..just the dry puppy food,with very little warm water to make it soft..not mushy<br>  <br>  and the baby needs to go to the vet, at this age, you need to make sure it has it's vaccinations,,,pups get sick easy....<br>  <br>  good dog foods<br>  <br>  Taste of the Wild, at any feed store<br>  Wellness<br>  Innova<br>  Evo<br>  Canidae<br>  Blue Buffalo<br>  <br>  do not feed these<br>  <br>  Iams<br>  Eukanuba<br>  Science Diet|`|wdKsVqbnaa	I am a breeder of 10+ years, and have always kept my puppies until they are 8 weeks old.  I have found that it's best to keep dry food out 24 hours a day for puppies.  A puppy won't over eat.......they'll only eat when they're hungry.  Since you don't have the mama to clean up after the puppy, it would be best to take the food and water away a few hours before bed time, so that he's not having accidents while you're a sleep.  But you'll have a healthier, happier puppy if you leave food out all the time.|`|3d4XE1Keaa	Don't use the same milk we drink!  Its not good for pets.  It usually gives them diarrhea.  She should be almost completely weaned by now anyway, so you can stick with just the dog food.  If she'll eat the dry by itself, that's fine.  Otherwise maybe add some canned to it.  If you still want to be safe though, pick up some puppy milk replacer at the pet store and add that to the dry food.  As far as how often, that's up to you.  At least twice a day though.  Some people take the daily amount and break it into 3 or 4 feedings.   When my Neapolitan mastiff was a puppy, I fed him three times a day.  But then again, I got him when he was 4 and a half months old and already 40 pounds.|`|CvsrmBn6aa	Her shot YOU gave her-worthless.<br>  Her dewormer YOU gave her-worthless.<br>  Reg. milk?

k2l20XdFaa	Yes, once the female is gravid you can put them together just to mate. I would not recommend keeping them together any longer than that. Once they mate, they can stay together for part of the gestation period. As far as housing, they should each have their own enclosure. Do more research and try it next year. Just please make sure that you will already have a plan together and know how to take care of the babies, and be able to sell them. Remember, they can give birth to many babies.
qzPZf2XPaa	Go to the health food section and you should be able to find 100% Peanut Butter.<br>  It will look hardy on the bottom and oily on top since without the salt or sugar added it isn't stable.<br>  You've got to mix it together with a knife, it's healthy for you and your dog!|`|AA10972366	Any kind.

F3FrZ7eAaa	Green grass snakes?<br>  <br>  Green snakes are insectivores, and are among the few snakes that eat a diet entirely consisting of insects. In the wild they mostly eat a variety of insects (such as crickets, moths, grasshoppers, caterpillars, and fly larvae) and spiders. <br>  In captivity, it is most practical to feed a diet primarily of crickets, although is is extremely important to make sure the diet is varied. Add items such as grasshoppers, spiders, moths, earthworms as much as possible. Meal worms can be fed, but only occasionally as their tough exoskeletons may post a risk of impaction (pick freshly molted meal worms to reduce the chances of this). Other soft feeder worms, such as wax worms, could also be fed occasionally. <br>  <br>  Since they aren't eating large meals like most other snakes, I would say every other day if not daily.|`|01nMRPHVaa	They eat mostly insects.|`|09fdLaeIaa	most grass snakes are thin<br>  they eat at least twice a day
qgeI6Chxaa	A husky would be fine. I live in Washington, and it isn't very hot here (not on the western side of the Cascades, anyway.) Temperatures above 80 are rare, and usually only last for a few days at a time. Some people with dogs like huskies shave them in the summer, but I wouldn't worry about the heat.|`|fxsJjn6jaa	Depends... If you have a fenced in yard with a lot of room to run yes.  If you dont have lots of exercise space, then no.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I wouldn't worry too much about a Husky in Washington ... if you were moving to Phoenix, I'd question your judgement, but Washington?

9mlY5cB1aa	2 goldfish, assuming they're fancy goldfish, need at least 55 gallons. If they are comet goldfish, they need at least 100 gallons, if not more. Goldfish need a LOT of room, people do not realize that. My guess is that their water conditions are terrible, even though you do regular water changes and have a filter, because your tank is probably way to small. I suggest you return the goldfish, and get fish that you can actually keep in the tank you have. There is absolutely no way to keep the tank clean, otherwise, with the fish you have, nor is there anyway to allow them to live to their fullest potential and longest life and to have a good quality of life, because their conditions are too cramped. You should probably get a heater, and have tropical fish instead, because most don't require near as much room, and there are a wide variety to choose from. You can email me for any questions.<br>  <br>  <br>  ---fish guy|`|UbSJPBuNaa	you can do a 25% water change every week, remember that goldfish are a huge bio load, also you could have them in too small of a tank. Could you specify?|`|rWGzVUxOaa	Your being very unspecific.  What type of goldfish are they b/c one of the previous answers describes the size tank youd need for the ones you may have.  What type of filters.  Usually you need a filter that is capable of cleaning more than your tank size.  How much water are you changing? for weekly should be about 10%.  Watch the dosage on the dechlorinater.  I prefer not to use clarifiers because it stresses the fish.  Instead try a larger water change and depending on the size of your tank( which would make this a lot easier to answer) you may need a powerhead (i recommend fluval 100%).  I am assuming that you have no live plants which brings up the question on whether you are actually digging deep throughout your gravel when you do water changes as that is a must if the tank is not planted.|`|AA12385773	Keep the insides of the actual tank itself wiped down.  You can buy something at the pet store that uses magnets to do it in a way that stresses the fish out less than sticking your clean hand in the tank.  DO NOT USE SOAP TO WASH UP!   Just use hot/warm water only.  That goes for ANYTHING the fish may come into contact with, including the tank. (Sorry I was not trying to YELL!  Lol.)  Use a special type of cleaning pad you get from the pet store too.  Rinsing out and/or replacing your filters often makes the biggest difference and it's healthy for your fish.  Good Luck!|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	You can get some Water clearer, it stresses them out though, so it's your choice!<br>  <br>  Good luck~~~|`|d4IJIV05aa	there is this little bottle wih red liquid that you can buy at walmart and it makes the water really clear|`|6f1MNa01aa	clean the tank every week.<br>  and for 34 gold fish you need at least a 29 gallon tank

One side should make a Griding type Noise , The other will make a sound kind of like a toilet flushing.<br>     If you hear very little or no noise , that's a good bet it's colic. <br>  Other then that ,if you didn't change anything from her grain maybe see if she with eat a diffrent type of Grain.

They stay in heat longer then 3 weeks.|`|nYv65TlEaa	well,if she was pregnant,it would show at about 5 weeks pregnant if she is pregnant,so she has been out of heat 3 weeks,and if she mated she would be about 4 to 5 weeks pregnant,<br>  <br>  some dogs just have hormonal problems,so it could be that<br>  <br>  when you have an intact male and a female in heat,you are just asking for a pregnancy<br>  <br>  <br>  10th day to 19th day of start of heat a very good chance of getting pregnant,<br>  I had my dam get pregnant at day 21 of start of heat<br>  <br>  so best is look up whelping,delivery for dogs,and good luck,you'll have to keep a close eye on her,yorkies have been known to have 6 puppies and one yorkie in my area had 8,real should for the owners<br>  <br>  you Pretty much in the dark right now,so unless her tummy gets bigger you won't know how pregnant she is,by 6 to 7 weeks of pregnancy you'll notice her belly getting bigger,her last week is when she'll put on lots,so since You don't know when she mated you won't be able to know exactly when to start giving her puppy food for calcium<br>  <br>  Try the site below,she gives great details in whelping,read read and read,get everything on her list of items you will need for whelping<br>  <br>  24 to 48 hrs before she is ready to whelp,she may not eat,every dog is different no matter what breed<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|TgRLsibGaa	OK first answer was uncalled for, thats harsh.<br>  If your sure that they didn't breed then there is a possibility of a false pregnancy my dog had one and went through everything that a mother dog would go through, she even had milk but no puppies cuz she was never bred, also if you think they might have she should start to show in time and start nesting, etc, but I would call your vet with her being swollen so soon, it usually takes longer for them to show signs of pregnancy, hope this helps :)|`|wdKsVqbnaa	I am a breeder of 10+ years.  3 weeks is too early to tell if she's pregnant.  The only way that you will know for 100% certainty, is if you take her to the vet after 4 weeks and have an x-ray or ultrasound done.  Also, if this was her first heat, her body will go through changes.  She's entering adulthood, and her nipples will swell like she's pregnant.  Also, a female can have a false pregnancy.  Just like being pregnant......swollen, saggy teets, gain weight, milk, and could even look VERY pregnant.  The only way to be sure, is to take her to the vet.  Depending on where you live, and x-ray may not cost that much.  Here, it's only $50 to have it done.  If you can afford 2 Yorkshire Terriers, you can afford a vet visit.|`|TMMqSg6uaa	its very irresponsible to have a male and a female dog when they both are not fixed<br>  and if your not planning on breading you should probably get them fixed (unless your female is pregnant)<br>  but get your male fixed<br>  if your yorkie is pregnant then some of her puppies have puppies<br>  and some of those puppies have puppies<br>  and then some of those puppies have puppies<br>  and so on<br>  then your responsible for those millions of puppies that started from your one dog<br>  and do you wanna know where half of those dogs will end up?<br>  half of those puppies will end up in homeless shelters or live on the streets<br>  and that will be your fault|`|xfBbEgQWaa	Go have your dogs fixed. If you can't tell if you dog is preg. You should not have 2 unfixed dogs!!!|`|nhCzZDE5aa	Go see a vet FAST!

1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	I had this problem.  I forgot to keep the labels from the bottles and when I went to my vet for my dogs neutering they would not take my word for it, so he needed to get vaccinated again.  I have learned now that I need to save the labels.  Those pamphlets are sold from where you order your vaccinations, such as Drs Foster and Smith.  The 5 way combo for Distemper is only like $5.00, but since they need to be shipped  immediately that is where it costs more.  Check out Drsfosterandsmith.com to get an idea.|`|c15rWijuaa	Yes, you should use the label on the bottles. And you should put them in a shot record. <br>  <br>  You can ask you vet for a free one or I have seen them sold at Petsmart for about $3.00. They look like little passports. <br>  <br>  And I'm not really sure how much they are. I would take a guess of maybe $15.00 -$20.00 a vaccine. It's guess. We haven't bought them in a long time so I'm not sure of current prices.|`|LURQBU86aa	Yes you can just get one of those dog shot record sheets/pamphlets and place the sticker inside.

IrdZKYT3aa	You could do a school of cory cats and otto cats.  The cory need to be in groups of 5 or more to be happy and More adventurous, but are great floor cleaners.  The otto cats are voracious little algae eaters.  They need to be kept in groups of 3 or more and max at around 1.5 inches.<br>  You could also have a school of marbles hatchet fish or killi, both are surface dwellers.  Killi can be hard to find but are worth it when you do!<br>  Perhaps a school of cherry barbs?  Or cardinal tetra?  Maybe a couple gourami as well.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|Rdpv91NTaa	this would be nice<br>  <br>  5 platy all male<br>  5 corydoras<br>  6 serpae tetra<br>  6 neon tetra<br>  6 rummy nose tetra|`|6f1MNa01aa	well... for 1 inch of fish you need a gallon of water for a 10 gallon tank since you have 4 2 inch tetras i'd say get 1 more tetra and NO more!|`|ugi4aUZXaa	any other kinds of tetras
e55cjnbJaa	You should move him into an aquarium of about ten gallons and buy more goldfish or black moors so he has company. Make sure you have two snails and regular water changes. For fish and snails I would suggest:<br>  - black moors<br>  - comet goldfish<br>  - oranda goldfish<br>  - apple snail<br>  - fantail goldfish<br>  <br>  Plants to Buy<br>  - Java Fern<br>  - Water Lilies<br>  - Photos Plant<br>  - Plastic Plants are good too<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1YNhKzeqaa	Gold fish grow really big, you really should have at least a 55 gal tank for when hes bigger. Move him into a tank, no fish should be in such a small space. Also, for oxygenation, you need water surface disturbance, so get him a good filter to filter the water and aid in oxygenation. Gold fish are super messy, and if you don't get him a good filter in a large enough tank, he can die from ammonia poisoning.<br>  What you have is not a self sustaining ecosystem... you need to help the fish.<br>  <br>  So definitely get him a tank.|`|yV8fog7Paa	that is cruel to keep it in that, get an aquarium.|`|TYohMrlXaa	Just, wow. I mean, where do I even start. This was a horrible idea, and I'm so sorry someone tried to teach you this was true. <br>  <br>  Your 2 liter soda bottle is nothing like a pond, but their are several key differences. A large surface area for the exchange of gasses and much more water are needed for the fish. Also food. :)  <br>  <br>  A self sustaining ecosystem is not possible here, But you can achieve a much closer replica in a large tank. The one big difference being the need for weekly 25% water changes to maintain water quality. <br>  <br>  The shear volume of water in a pond, the fresh water provided by rainfall, maybe by an underground spring or a river = "water changes"<br>  The filter in a fish tank is necessary as a way to oxygenate the water by providing surface agitation, the carbon that removes harmful wastes, and as the perfect place for the bacteria responsible for eating fish waste to grow. <br>  <br>  In a pond the fish is not subject to horrible water quality that they cannot escape from. There is no way your setup can establish a good bacteria colony to process the waste given off by the fish and snail.<br>  <br>  Learn about the cycle, some real biology for you.<br>  <a href="http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biologicalcycle/a/nitrogencycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...</a><br>  <br>  It would be so much safer and better and wonderful of you to give this fish a tank. Please get a 20 gallon long to start.(yes, just for him) With lights and a filter. Water conditioner and food for the little guy. New fish-only bucket, and a gravel vac siphon hose for water changes.<br>  <br>  Plants will only release oxygen into the water when given proper lighting, they have a "breathing" cycle too, and release carbon dioxide at night. Their must be enough surface area to provide the oxygen, in a tank you will need a filter and ideally an air pump too.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you take it upon yourself to learn some more info about keeping a goldfish tank, and acclimating the fish. Shock your classmates by keeping your fish alive! Common goldfish can reach up to a foot long and live for 15+ years!|`|ad7c42cce90c3663b9c47e1866a1347aaa	actually it is pretty cruel. cause goldfish do get very large. and yes those small things can work, but normally i only seen them with shrimps which stay small that actually work for small bottles.... but even that seems questionable. i do suggest to put the gold fish into a tank with the typical requirements with a filter and such, they really do need a clean water. they make a lot of waste.|`|7erjLpuWaa	wow, that seems kinda cruel to me.  Yes, definitely move these to a tank.  Cut a hole at the top of the bottle to get your specimens out.  Please go with as big of a tank that is possible--preferably over 15 gallons.|`|MG2jo26Oaa	Yes, if you don't have to take it back and you want the fish to live then you need to move it to a tank. But I need more information here. What kind of fish is it?<br>  <br>  -----EDIT:<br>  <br>  It is cruel, no matter how many people have done it, it is cruel. A goldfish. Is it long-bodied with pretty short fins? If it is then its a common or a comet goldfish and they can grow to be 12+ inches long. They need a 50 gallon tank for one fish. This goldfish WILL get MUCH bigger if you move it to a big tank. Goldfish need cold water, powerful filters, and 25% weekly water changes.|`|zqVDJxUIaa	Oh my... the teacher must be a total dumbo! Or maybe he/she is just a plain old fish torturer. Call the SPCA! The bottle is stunting the goldfish's growth, not because 'goldfish stay small'. Goldfish grow up to 4"! If you don't open it, you can't feed it. If you don't feed it, it dies! So much for a 'pretty little self-contained piece of...(dung)!' (I had to try and find a polite word there). Please, find a TANK for your fish. It will die within a week in the silly ecosystem... and if you don't get a tank with a filter quickly enough, and the fish dies, dump it on the teacher's desk, with a little note: saying 'This is what you get for what you do'. Ha!<br>  <br>  You MUST do water changes! No water changes means a buildup of toxic chemicals like ammonia and nitrites, which will KILL YOUR FISH! Oh, yes. It IS CRUEL. Please read this site about caring for goldfish!<br>  <a href="http://www.your-goldfish.com/care-for-goldfish.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.your-goldfish.com/care-for-go...</a><br>  <br>  A pond does in fact have a filter. If you're talking about a large outdoor pond (natural one), keep in mind that it is not a closed climate system like an aquarium (or bottle)! A natural river or lake has a constant flow of water, so obviously, water does not need to be changed.<br>  <br>  There's no such thing as a SMALL goldfish. ALL goldfish grow to at least 3". Your goldfish won't eat micro-organisms. It needs REAL FOOD! Flake food would be perfect.<br>  <br>  Cut out the top part (with the bottle cap) if it's too small. Think creatively! How hard can it be?!?!<br>  <br>  You NEED a filter for your fish. No filter = dead fish, just like your ecosystem. I also highly doubt that the plant is aquatic. It's probably just another normal above ground plant.<br>  <br>  Ecosystem.... more like a old pop container containing one dead fish, one dead plant, and one dead snail.<br>  Please move your fish away from the torture chamber and into a proper home. First, you need to cycle the aquarium (establishing beneficial bacteria) VERY IMPORTANT! For inof on cycling, visit this site:<a href="http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cyclin...</a><br>  <br>  Your teacher should not teach stuff about aquatic species if he doesn't know anything about it. <br>  <br>  I don't intend to be mean, but it's not your fault. However... I just hate seeing people do stuff like that to the poor fishy...<br>  Good Luck!

8Ymsx4Oraa	55 is BARE min for one. A 150 would be BARE min for two. No tank mates. Most will eventually get eaten. Any reputable fish shop should have good quality oscars, if not buy from a local breeder. Don't get two unless you have the room as two males would be tight. Worms and that are ok as long as there safe (who's to say the neighbour didn't just spray that fly?) Best to buy prepacked tho. Any filter that is higher then your recommended flow will do. Not necessarily a HOB. And as for gravel BLACK looks cool!!<br>  <br>  Best of luck Angel<br>  <br>  Edit: lol did she just answer the same q? wtf? 10 gal where does it mention that? Lmao..|`|bD7Yaatkaa	A filter is a must, but TopFin is a pretty reasonable company, you don't really need something too fancy. Sounds like you have a ten gallon, but I'm not 100% on that.<br>  Here's were you have a choice, to get a heater or not. ALL TROPICAL FISH NEED A HEATER. With no heater I recomend a school of white cloud mountain minnow. They need to be in a group, but don't need to be heated, they prefer cooler waters. They're very striking, especially the longer finned variety. I'd avoid goldfish as they are extremlly messy and you'll need excellent increased filtration to keep even one alone in the tank. They need a lot of filtration and a lot of space.<br>  With a heater, about 15 bucks for a ten gallon heater, you've got a lot more options.<br>  I'd suggest fake plants, easir to keep and you won't need special lighting.<br>  As for placing avoid direct sun light. And make sure whatever surface you use can support the ful weight of the aquarium.<br>  As for lighting, with just fish a simple light is fine, plants need a better lighting system.<br>  With pretty much all tropical fish tropical flakes are fine. The minnow will eat these fine as well.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|h4wNRqf9aa	couldn't help you im in chicago<br>  <br>  Marineland Emperor 400, probably may favorite HOB line<br>  <br>  only in a bigger tank...<br>  <br>  sure, it's a crapload better than goldfish<br>  <br>  sure, it's up to you, try not to use any rocks that would react if you driped some vinegar on them, they'll raise the pH of the tank<br>  <br>  a 55 is barely bg enough for one oscar (many myself included would say it isn't big enough at all) stick to just him untill you get a larger tank<br>  <br>  i like black, it cuts glare and brings out the color of the fish
vVAwFgcJaa	Yep, an air pump on a sponge filter would be the way to go.|`|OblSdMaaaa	You need a pump for a filter like this to work.  The only alternative to using a water pump would be an air pump (for a sponge filter).
gUMucKOkaa	You really need to ask your vet about this.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11736483	The cat grass they sell in the pet stores is the kind that is good for cats, but it is expensive. I would stick with that rather than regular outside grass.<br>  I had a cat with constipation problems and we found that lactulose really helped. You get it from your vet. It is not expensive and comes as a syrup in a bottle. You put a little bit in with their food and it keeps the stool soft and moving along. It is dose dependent, that is, the more you use, the softer the stool gets, so you can overdo it and end up with runny stools. There are no real side effects, so I would recommend trying it if you haven't.
iiNAJfGCaa	Sometimes finding a good chiropractor through word of mouth is better than finding one who is certified. Just make sure that they have really good recommendations. I have my horse seen by a chiropractor 5-6 times a year. He always moves better after his sessions. My chiropractor explains how horses get tweaked like this: "It may start out with just a small muscle soreness in their neck (or in this case, your horse's shoulder) but to compensate for that soreness while they are getting ridden they become tight through their back. Then to compensate for that soreness they become tight through their hind end and soon they're stiff and tight everywhere just from a small soreness in their neck that is already gone." So I would say go for it. Your horse will definitely thank you!|`|3bzaDhReaa	Some vets do chiropractor manipulations  as well as acupuncture.  My mare hurt her hip and back at a trainers.  She would not let me near her with a surcingle or saddle.  The vet came and gave her one reasonably priced treatment and she was fine. She had pain in her neck as well.  She now stands to be saddled without being tied.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	I have heard good things about them, I haven't used one myself though.<br>  I would go with a certified equine specialist.|`|AA11211495	I am going to agree with Seeker on this one.  It sounds more like a soft tissue problem to me.  I am a certified equine sports massage therapist.  If this were my horse I would look for a massage therapist before I would call a chiro.  You can visit the International Association of Animal Massage Therapists at <a href="http://www.iaamt.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iaamt.com/</a> and send them an e-mail using the link at the bottom of the page for help locating a massage therapist in your area.  The therapist should do an evaluation of your horse free of charge.|`|DkeNHYWFaa	If money is not an issue then definitely go ahead with a chiropractor. It may sound silly but if your horse needs it to be comfortable, then you need to do what works for him. Also equine massooses are becoming popular and I bet one of them could help you. A friend of ours is an equine masoose and she is gonna work on my qh gelding, Kansas, for his arthritis.|`|q5S8VnuGaa	have been using them for years. give it a go 'certified' or not.|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	equine chiropracters definately work. but unqualified ones, personally i wouldnt risk it. if its the cost that means you cant get a vet to be the chiropracter as much as you could get an unqualified one to then maybe consider using a vet a couple of times and hopefully your horse will get better, this way you get good quality care and no risk.<br>  doing this type of work wrong can damage your horse, it's dangerous if you dont know what you're doing, especially since your horse sounds quite bad .. in the neck area aswell :S i wouldnt risk it personally|`|vtFDRfdzaa	The training exercises you are putting JAZZ through are not natural movements to any horse. They often caused strained/ inflamed tendons and muscle soreness. JAZZ'S particular physiology (not breed specific) may not be suited to dressage. Suspend training for 2 months and ride him for minor exercise in natural movements only and observe his range of motion and weight distribution. If he paddles out or pigeon toes in look into corrective shoeing (inexpensive) to fix his natural stride. Chiropractic bone/ joint manipulation Always increases calcium growth at areas moved. It's great at first but eventually makes people or animals dependent upon it for pain relief. I would only consider it an extreme last resort. Happy Trails...|`|TSc8OE4vaa	This sounds like a good candidate for an equine chiropractor.  Maybe you could have one come in from another state, who is certified in that state, to do his back?  That would only work if you are close to another state which allows equine chiropractors.  <br>  <br>  I think there is no real risk to the horse, as long as you are there watching to keep an eye on things there's no real damage that can be done.  The only risk is it not working and you paying all of that money for it!<br>  <br>  I'd probably go for the chiropractor, if it's been 2 months already this issue isn't going to fix itself.
nQdGGBN4aa	Steps to follow to wash a cat:<br>  <br>  1) Insure an adequate supply of blood which is compatible with your blood type. I am AB+ and can receive any positive type - A, B, AB, O. If you don't know your blood type, ask you doctor to run a test and let you know. I would suggest having at least 3 units of blood standing by before you begin the cat's bath.<br>  <br>  2) Get a hockey goalie's mask to reduce the amount of damage done to your face while you wash the cat.<br>  <br>  3) Wear the thickest gloves you can find which still give you some dexterity.<br>  <br>  4) Put up warning barriers to keep innocent bystanders away from the scene of the action in order to avoid injury to said innocent bystanders.<br>  <br>  5) Remove everything from the counter top, surrounding the sink to be used, to reduce breakage.<br>  <br>  6) Insure that someone is standing by, safely outside the action area, who can administer first aid - such as the application of tourniquets to stem blood flow - as needed.<br>  <br>  7) Adjust the water temperature to about 90 degree Fahrenheit.<br>  <br>  8) Pick up the cat, hold at arms length and put it in the sink. It is at this point that you want your first aid person paying attention to the action.<br>  <br>  9) Wet down the cat, avoiding the face. Again, your first aider should be alert during this procedure.<br>  <br>  10) Apply the shampoo and lather well stay way from the face and ears. Disregard the red color to the shampoo draining off the cat, that's just your blood, the cat is okay.<br>  <br>  11) Rinse off the shampoo, again, the cat is fine, the red is your blood, not the cat's.<br>  <br>  12) Repeat steps 9 through 11 - if you are still able to stand and are not dizzy from blood loss.<br>  <br>  13) Dry the cat well. You can use a hair dryer set on low if you don't hold it on the cat very long. Move the air flow on and off the cat. You can also dry the cat fairly well with a towel. You will want to use an old towel since it is difficult to get blood stains out of cloth.<br>  <br>  14) Go to an emergency room to have them suture the deep scraps and bites you've picked up. You may need that extra blood at this point. It is wise not to drive yourself to the emergency room if you are in the least bit dizzy from blood loss. Have someone take you or call for an ambulance.<br>  <br>  You should be aware that some medical insurance plans will not pay for self inflicted damage and injuries incurred while bathing a cat are generally considered to be self inflicted. <br>  <br>  BETTER IDEA -- forget about bathing the cat. Start combing the cat. Combs generally work better than brushes to remove loose hair.<br>  <br>  The best comb for working out loose hair is actually a flea comb. Go easy with it since you will probably run into mats or tangles.<br>  <br>  I work mats apart by gently pulling at them, with my fingers, from side to side, to break them apart. Try to not pull outwards on mats. Just work at them gently and you'll get them out.<br>  <br>  We once tried to bath two 9 week old kittens and the only thing we accomplished was to learn that they had all 19 of their claws - 10 front, 9 in the back.<br>  <br>  There is nothing that would get me to bath a cat. Even if the cat was sprayed by a skunk I'd not want to wash them. If I had to, I'd want to sedate them first.<br>  <br>  So comb, comb, and comb some more.<br>  <br>  Some cats, it has to be a small percentage, will let you vacuum them, maybe your cat would ???|`|UnA531DNaa	Well, if they're not declawed, then at least clip them.  Some cats, even if they've never had a bath before, are surprisingly calm... I had a siamese that didn't have a problem with me giving him a bath, as long as I kept a firm grip on the back of his neck.  However, a friend of mine tried to give him a bath and he clawed her all up!  <br>  <br>  I would say to use a bucket of warm water and a sponge.  Set your cat in the tub next to the bucket, and just sponge the water on him slowly.  If he freaks out, put the soap on him and start rubbing it in, he'll figure out it's a grooming procedure and calm down.  Make sure you towel him dry and hold him, because that will make the experience more pleasant for him, and he'll likely not fight about it in the future if you end it like that.|`|e1bc9ee12a586a97194ed85c52656355aa	Oh dear lord, don't try a cat bath. Unless your cat has had a bath on a daily basis since it was a kitten, it's not going to like it at all. And there will be no "calming down". <br>  I have 5 indoor cats that are massive shedders during season changes. I use a long silver shedding comb for medium sized dogs. It has been a god send, and the cats love it. Use a shedding blade first get all the loose. Then use the comb to get through the mats and tangles. Be gentle and have fun :) <br>  The brushes combined will cost around 30$ Worth the investment. The shedding blade works awesome on cat tree's and other furniture for quick clean up of hair.|`|QLWPvFmuaa	Since your problem is the cat shedding, I would recommend trying some grooming tools rather than bathing.  I have short to medium length fur on my guys and I like a long-toothed rubber brush called a Kong Zoom Groom.  I have also used a Love glove on short-haired cats.  Regular brushing will keep the dead hair groomed out and you can stay ahead of the problem.  Good luck.  purrs|`|6MMqbzs2aa	My older cat is inclined to scratch me if I have wet hair, she hates water that much. We got a large plastic tub full of water and some shampoo, and we got two people to hold her front paws and back paws and lowered her in. She wriggled a lot, but we held on tight so she couldn't get her paws free. Then we got our friend to do the actual shampooing and it went off without a hitch. No scratches or anything. Just a wet and bedraggled looking cat who went to sulk under the table for an hour. <br>  <br>  Hope that works :]|`|srjPOxW7aa	Almost all cats hate baths or anything like it. Your best bet is to get those pet wash cloths or just get one  of your own and dampen it and wipe away rinse and proceed wiping until all clean :)|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Brushing will do more good than bathing.  Those shampoos don't remove any more hair than the average shampoo - it's just another marketing tool.  If you want the cat to have a great bath & brush go to groomers.  They can get far more hair than you & are used to handling cats. They have high velocity dryers which most cats will only allow for a certain amount of time but it really blows out the loose hair.<br>  <br>  Otherwise investing in a de-shedding comb or a furminator will do much more at removing hair than a bath at home.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Your cat doesn't need a bath. S/he needs daily grooming with a shedding comb and a proper diet.  Feeding low quality foods full of grain fillers and low quality proteins like by-products will add to the problem of shedding.

Jkt3UkTBaa	Yes, you can.<br>  <br>  My Uncle had a Goldfish live in a 2 gallon bowl for 7 years!!!<br>  <br>  But I would not recommend that, get a very efficient filter and bubbler, lots of hiding places and things for him to do.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|yV8fog7Paa	no|`|00RgkZF8aa	No you can't.<br>  <br>  1 Fancy Goldfish needs at least a 20 gallon tank with a filter.<br>  <br>  A 10 gallon tank is too small to allow the fish to grow to its full potential.<br>  <br>  And don't listen to the 1" per 1 gallon rule...|`|bD7Yaatkaa	yes of course. also you might want to add a neon glow fish they are so cool they are fresh water you can put in a (block) of food that they eat when they are hungry and the block lasts for 10 days or you can buy flake food.they are really small and cheap like less than 3.00 so you can get a bunch they glow in the dark and <br>  they are sooo cool|`|G4MKs2wmaa	The general rule for fish in a fishtank is:<br>  <br>   1 inch of fish per 1 gallon|`|ZupV4QNhaa	no, goldfish get quite larger than you think.

Sounds like you have a ten gallon, but I'm not 100% on that.<br>  Here's were you have a choice, to get a heater or not. ALL TROPICAL FISH NEED A HEATER. With no heater I recomend a school of white cloud mountain minnow. They need to be in a group, but don't need to be heated, they prefer cooler waters. They're very striking, especially the longer finned variety. I'd avoid goldfish as they are extremlly messy and you'll need excellent increased filtration to keep even one alone in the tank. They need a lot of filtration and a lot of space.<br>  With a heater, about 15 bucks for a ten gallon heater, you've got a lot more options.<br>  I'd suggest fake plants, easir to keep and you won't need special lighting.<br>  As for placing avoid direct sun light. And make sure whatever surface you use can support the ful weight of the aquarium.<br>  As for lighting, with just fish a simple light is fine, plants need a better lighting system.<br>  With pretty much all tropical fish tropical flakes are fine. The minnow will eat these fine as well.<br>  Best of Luck!

Good choices might be neon tetras, cardinal tetras, guppies, mollies, platies. General rule is 1-2 in per gallon.

e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	She should only be bleeding slightly after all kittens are completely out. If she is not acting uncomfortable, meowing alot, drinking alot, panting or contracting anymore. She should only bleed slightly for a day or so... you should only see a little blood on her backside and/or smeared on blankets. If she is bleeding heavily still she needs to get to a vet asap.. she could have a retain placenta/kitten/or tear.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a good plan, if her bleeding is a small amount and tapering off she should be done in a day or 2.|`|LURQBU86aa	It's not uncommon for cats to "spot" for up to a week after they give birth.

622ea772914089a4e5db758f396fbb8eaa	As the other two persons indicated, Moogie is looking for attention.  All animals--pets, that is--need stimulation, especially if they are confined indoors.  Cats, although most often thought of as lazy because they sleep so much, like to play.  Unfortunately, a cat's idea of play usually involves biting and scratching.  I play with our cat Boo regularly, chasing him around the house, massaging him roughly when I catch him, throwing those small plastic rings around for him to chase after (the rings that are left over when you open a bottle that has a plastic cap), which for some reason he goes bonkers over.  For that I have a lot of healing scratch and bite marks on my hands.  I don't mind, although you might.  <br>  One thing I have observed is that cats, like dogs, each have their own personality.  So Moogie may be doing that for a different reason than I said.  You just have to observe him/her and try different things in order to figure out what he/she wants.|`|UETAqR8Taa	i think moogie wants to play and/or have entertainment|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Because she knows that meowing at the door gets your attention, and probably only wants some petting.

JIdDcTXGaa	OK, I kind of skimmed over the other answers and wanted to give you my advice. First, there are 3 types of rats, not 2, the 3rd type is VERY different from the first 2 and I think it is a safe bet that your rat is not one of these.<br>  <br>  The 3 types are Fancy, Dumbo and Natal.  Fancy rats are actually what some ppl refer to as feeder rats. However, as a breeder of both Fancy and Natal, I can tell you there is a big difference between them. Fancy rats, when socialized, don't usually bite. I breed these for pets, making sure my rats are well socialized by spending (or trying to) time with them everyday. I pet them, love them, cuddle them and mostly, give them time outside of their cage. <br>  <br>  You have 1 rat, which is going to get lonely unless you spend a lot of time with him/her. If possible, try to get your rat a companion, same sex. Usually I tell ppl if you have to ask what sex your rat is, it's probably a girl. By the time a rat (unless you are referring to a natal rat) is weaned, it already has very visible sex organs, for boys. Here's the best way to tell. Take your little guy and hold him in your hand with his back in your hand so you can see his belly, if you see testicles by his/her tail, it's a boy, if not, congratulations, it's a girl.<br>  <br>  Cage: Rats like to climb and are very smart. Get a cage that allows them plenty of room to move about. I usually go with the rule about 2 square feet of space for the first rat and 1 extra foot per additional rat. With rats however, the bigger the better as far as cages go. <br>  <br>  Did you know you can train your rat? Oh yes, You can train him/her to play in water, which is especially useful for bucks or male rats because of their smell, used for marking. Males do tend to smell more than females do. Start with a container that your rat can get into easily and back out of. The person I learned this from used a paint roller pan, brand new, never used. I personally use a hospital basin I had and cut a door into the side of it so my rats could get in and out. Put some small shiny stone and use treats, preferably that don't float, mine love thawed frozen peas. Start with the water low, just above the top of the foot and slowly, every couple of days, raise the water level. You'll find in no time that your rat will actually put her head under the water to reach the peas and it's really fun to watch.<br>  <br>  Food: I use a mix of my own. I start with parrot food, a seed mix. I strain out the smaller seeds, but that's because my Natal's like those better than the larger ones and my fancies like the bigger rather than the smaller ones. I also given them pine nuts, dried and frozen fruit, veggies, and some meat. NEVER give your rats something that is unsafe for you to eat, like spoiled food. Basically, make sure your rat eats a healthy diet of fruits and veggies, protein and starch. I don't use lab blocks for my fancies because to me it is like dry dog food. The healthier you feed your rat, the longer it will live. One of the most important things you can give your rat is love. <br>  <br>  You asked if you could hold it. My answer is yes, yes, YES!!! Rats love to be held and loved. Females are more hyper and exploratory than males are. Male rats like to be snuggled and cuddled, where females are more playful. You can always look on you tube for more training videos. I have listed the links to my web sites and to someone I work with for training videos for my site. My sites are both still under construction, so watch for updates on them. I work on them every week, so things may change from one week to the next. <br>  <br>  So, to recap, love, healthy diet, lots of room, love, you can train them, they are smart and, oh yeah, lots of love and cuddling. <br>  <br>  Natal rats and thought to be the link between rats and mice, having characteristics of both. Much bigger than mice, a 2 month old Natal rat is the size of a full grown mouse. Smaller than Fancy rats, a full grown Natal rat is about the size of a 2 month old rat. They are very, almost wanted to say nippy, but they go for blood, not just a warning nip and are very hard to socialize and keep socialized.|`|79ab050dbcc8861f2c6be1d80f755328aa	?Rats and Mouse Club of America: www.rmca.org<br>  ?Rat and Mouse Fanciers for Excellence: www.RodentFancy.com<br>  ?The Wererat’s Lair: www.wererat.net<br>  ?The Rat Fan Club (Debbie “The Rat Lady” Ducommun): www.RatFanClub.org<br>  ?American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association: www.afrma.org/afrma<br>  ?National Fancy Rat Society: www.nfrs.org<br>  <br>  Do a lot of research, it sounds like you have no idea of how to take care of a rat, but you will learn if you educate yourself. Anyways, good luck and make that rat happy!|`|6W4ZWOetaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Congratulations to you for rescuing the rat.  Since you've never owned a rat, I'm glad to help you enjoy the wonderful little animal that you have taken into your care.<br>  <br>  I think your rat is probably a female because males have extra large testicles that hang off the back, and they're pretty obvious.<br>  <br>  This answer will be long, but I hope it will help you.<br>  <br>  1)  Rats should NEVER be kept in a tank.  That is probably part of the reason she smells so bad.  Rats have a lot of ammonia in their urine that stinks and it is really hard on their respiratory system.  In a tank there is no place for the ammonia to evaporate and it sits in there stinking and harming your rat's lungs.<br>  <br>  The rat should have a wire cage with plenty of room to run around and levels.  Rats need to climb and exercise!<br>  <br>  2) Also, rats need rat friends.  Rats are highly social animals and actually become depressed, lonely, and can die from being alone.  I know that might sound over the top, but it's true!  If your rat is still small, then it's young enough to easily make friends with another rat without too much trouble.  Also, females are generally more apt to make friends (of the same sex, or else you'll have tons of rats) easily.<br>  <br>  3) So once you get a cage and a rat friend, here's what they need to eat!  There are special rat foods out there.  I recommend Harlan brand above all, but it is sometimes difficult to get, so in that case I would recommend Oxbow, Mazuri or Volkmann's rat foods.  Don't feed your rat dog food or cat food because it has too much protein, which is bad for rats.  Supplement your rats diet with snacks of fresh fruits and veggies (except do not give her Oranges or mushrooms, citrus and fungus can be toxic to rats).  A rat can eat pretty much anything you eat, and if you think it would be bad for you, it's probably bad for the rat, only on a much larger scale because the rat is so much smaller than you.<br>  <br>  You can google local breeders in your area.  Your local rat breeder is also going to be a great source of information on rat care, and might be able to recommend good places in your area to buy supplies for your rats.<br>  <br>  4) A rat also needs a nice little box to hide and sleep in.  This will help her feel safe. <br>  <br>  5) As for litter in the cage don't ever use pine, cedar or corn cobs.  Pine and Cedar have aromatic oils that are bad for the rat's lungs.  Rats have delicate respiratory systems.  They also have dust that is bad for the same reason.  Corn cob bedding harbors mold which is also bad for the rat's lungs, and it's expensive and not very soft to sit on, and the rat could eat it which can cause bloat.  I recommend either carefresh bedding (made from recycled paper) or Aspen bedding because it doesn't have the same aromatic oils as pine or cedar.     <br>  <br>  You'll need to clean the rat cage once or twice a week.  This sounds like a lot of work, but it's actually not that bad.  I have eight rats, and I can clean all three cages in an hour or so.  <br>  <br>  6) Water bottles: You can buy the plastic bottles with the little tube and ball on the end.  These are best for cleanliness.  Rats don't do well drinking from a dish because they splash it all over (more wetness in their bedding!) and they pee and poo in it, and it's just yucky for them.  These little bottles come with hanging equipment usually.<br>  <br>  7) Heating... rats need temperature control, but don't like it to be too hot or cold, just like you, so room temperature or a little warmer is fine.  If they are too hot they can get heat exhaustion and get very ill or die, and if they get too cold they can get respiratory and joint problems.<br>  <br>  8) Yes you can hold your rat, and you should!  It might take some time to get used to you at first, but if you give the rat little treats and talk to it, and be patient you'll have a great little pal in no time!<br>  <br>  Rats are very very smart, and they have wonderful personalities.  They also can be extremely affectionate and will sometimes lick you like a dog.  They are all different, but they're awesome pets.  That's why I've had so many over the years.  They are my favorite pet.<br>  <br>  9) Other fun rat things:  Rats' teeth grow their entire lives and they need to chew!  There are tons of little chew toys you can buy at the store for them.  They also like to run through tunnels and sleep in hammocks, it's really cute!<br>  <br>  Wish you the best of luck.  Please feel free to email me or IM me if you have any other questions.|`|BWez86Ldaa	First, I'll answer any questions  you have directly. Heating is not necessary, water bottles are fine, get a new cage, and read this information: <br>  <br>  1. "Rat"<br>  Rats are extremely social creatures and need to be housed in pairs of two or in groups of three or more. Being a lone pet, to a rat, is like being locked up in a room alone for us, so it is absolutely beneficial to have either a pair or group of rats.<br>  <br>  2. Cages:<br>  The one and only thing to remember about cages is that rats' urine has a lot of ammonia in it, and because of this you *must* have an open-air cage if you want to keep your rats healthy. The cages I suggest are Martin's cage ((<a href="http://www.martinscages.com))" rel="nofollow">http://www.martinscages.com))</a> or the Ferret Nation or Critter Nation by Midwest ((<a href="http://www.midwesthomesforpets.com/))." rel="nofollow">http://www.midwesthomesforpets.com/)).</a> All three of these cages are completely awesome for rats and will allow your babies plenty of room for play and furniture!!<br>  <br>  3. Gender<br>  This is a big debate in the rat owner world, it all depends on preference. Males tend to be more "loving" and want to settle down and snuggle, where as females tend to be more outgoing and want to always know what's going on and are always looking for what to get into next. After rat puberty, males can be aggressive toward other rats, so this is something to consider. If neutering isn't a problem and you want a cuddling fluff of joy, choose boys. If you're wanting a classic rat who's into everything, get girls. Personally, I prefer girls.<br>  <br>  4. Food<br>  This is, probably, the biggest debate in the rat world! The one basic thing to remember is that you must do your research! Personally, I serve a mix called SueBee's mix. <br>  <br>  A: SueBee's Mix: is a combonation of cereals, dried fruits, nuts, and so on that you mix together yourself with ingredients you can buy from any common grocery store. Here is the website for more information: ((<a href="http://www.ratsrule.com/diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratsrule.com/diet.html</a> )) Suebee's mix is meant to be served with an equal portion of premium dog food along with fresh fruits and veggies.<br>  <br>  There is also the Molasses diet, which is simular to SueBee's diet only in that you mix it yourself and you can buy all the ingredients from your local grocery store. Here is the website for more information: ((<a href="http://www.ratfanclub.org/diet.html))." rel="nofollow">http://www.ratfanclub.org/diet.html)).</a><br>  <br>  5. Cage Fillers, Accessories, and Bathing:<br>  <br>  A. Bedding:<br>  Personally, I do not use any kind of "bedding" I use only fabrics, mostly fleece because rats tend to get their little nails stuck in other fabrics. I enjoy using fleece and fabrics for "bedding" because it's easy to clean and completely reusable. If you want something for your kids to dig in, CareFresh is the most suggested bedding I can possibly think of. I used it when I had mice and I just loved it, however, it's not easy to clean, and because of it's fluffy nature, it tends to get "all over the place". <br>  <br>  B. Accessories<br>  Almost anything can go in a rat's cage. Hammocks, ropes, ferret toys, bird toys, puppy toys, boxes, igloos, and so on. The more "stuff" the better, and the more fun your little ones will have ruffling around the "junk". Try ((<a href="http://www.Ferret.com))" rel="nofollow">http://www.Ferret.com))</a> for some good ideas!<br>  <br>  C. Bathing<br>  In general rats need only to be bathed once every 6 months or less. Rats are extremely clean creatures, contrary to popular belief. If your cage has a bad "smell", it is for one of two reasons: You're not cleaning the cage often enough, or you are using a glass tank, so either clean the cage more often or  you need to get a new open-air cage for your rat.<br>  <br>  D. Toys<br>  The most funnest thing to do with rats is: fill a box with shredded papers and fruits or veggies, mix it up with the shredded papers and cut a hole in the box. They will love digging through the papers to get the food.<br>  Tunnels & tubes.<br>  Take a TP tube and stuff it with goodies then tie it closed at both ends and hang it in the cage.<br>  Hanging fruit.<br>  Chew toys<br>  Ferret toys (the octoplay is very fun)<br>  Old wine racks make great toys<br>  Cat toys (jingle balls, tennis balls)<br>  Big boxes with holes cut in them as castles <br>  Pea (or other fruits/veggies) diving : put peas in a bowl of water and let them go for it!<br>  Cat towers<br>  Anything to climb on, old cage ladders, wine racks, old shelving, etc.<br>  The BEST toy in the world is other ratties! <3<br>  <br>  6. Handling:<br>  The amount of time you spend with your pets is all on you. Personally, my kids get at least one hour (usually three to four) of free roam per day. The more you handle your rats, the more social and loving they will be. The less you handle them, the more likely they are to be aggressive toward you and other humans. It is, however, suggested that pet rats have at least one hour per day of play time.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm suprised, it actually cut off 7 - 9! >.> If you have more questions, want more information, or just want to chat about being a rat parent, please visit the Goosemoose forums or Email me at PirateCaptainLoo@Yahoo.com!|`|3eSzjwEhaa	well my hamster has never bitten me at all ok well the best cages are called critter trail my cage is the critter trail z or the critter trail x is good too. i have had all my cages be critter trail they are fun to have and very good for active small pets just get it some rat food that says diet on it get it some treats that have honey in them with seeds also.the cages are a little expensive but they last for a long time. you might have trouble putting it together because the are confusing  but once you get another one they are easy. get it some bedding and litter thing it looks like dry grass but it is just thin wood shavings. to hold them let it come to you or tell your friend how he would grab it|`|4f9013b2cc226802e89e2f659281cb46aa	To find if it is a girl or boy check its "private part". Boy have giant balls sticking out. Try to get at least a 10 gallon aquarium or a real rat cage for more room. You can go to petsmart or petco and pick up rat food and a little thing for water. Rats are covered with fur and will easily get heat strokes. Do not put in a heater. Leave the fan on at all times. At the pet store you can buy Oder-free bedding, so you don't have a stinky room! Buy it exercise equipment, like a wheel or ball. Buy a house for it to hide and sleep in. Rats are very smart and cuddly. It needs to be loved and held.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	All rats, no matter if they're dumbo or standard (usually the ones referred to as feeders) will grow to be about a foot in length including the tail. Tanks are not suitable at all for rats, since they have ammonia in their urine, it will build up and become toxic. If you insist on using a tank, get a larger tank and get a "tank topper" to proved airflow and more room to play and climb. But it will usually be cheaper to buy something like a My First Home for Exotics or a small ferret cage when he is larger. There are special bottle holders for tanks that clip over the ledge. You do not need to heat the cage if you keep your house around 70. If not, there are small animal heaters you can place under one side of the cage. However, a humidifier will do a rat good, especially in winter to prevent mycoplasma (nasty respiratory disease that is fatal). There is something pet stores sell called lab blocks, they are large pellet like foods. That is suitable for a rat. If it is a male, there isn't much you can do for the smell other than cleaning out the cage weekly and bathing him with dawn every other week to remove the oily substance they produce called "buck grease".  Rats are very social and affectionate. Just hold a treat for him and let him take it. Let him ride around on your shoulder to get to know you. Move quiet and slowly around the cage so you don't scare him and no loud music around the cage, as rats have very sensitive hearing. Rats are not prone to biting unprovoked, they usually just jump back and squeal when startled. If he does this, just make your hand into a fist and let him sniff your hand. If he bites or nibbles, pucker your lips and make a kissing sound. This is how rats tell each other off. But I wouldn't leave him alone, get it another rat of the same gender to hang out with. Be sure of the sex, (it's obvious if it's a male) because female rats go into heat every 5 days, mating only takes 3 seconds, and the average litter size is 18 babies. Rats are social and need companionship, it's cruel to leave him by himself. PLEASE do research on these guys so you can properly care for them. They are wonderful pets and are fairly simple to take care of, you just have to know how.|`|Njx3roeDaa	Pierre,<br>  <br>     Looks like your doing good. Welcome to owning a rat! It's actually quite fun. I suggest going to pet-smart and getting the following-<br>  <br>  -A about 5-6 gallon aquarium. As he/she grows, they will need a bigger one to run around and have fun with.<br>  <br>  -Reggie Rat food<br>  -Forti Diet (Feed 1-2 a day)<br>  <br>  -Rat Sheddings for the Aquarium/cage<br>  <br>  -Water dispenser<br>  --------<br>  Clean the cage/aquarium every 2 weeks or 1 week if it's pretty bad. Refill it with new water, food, and rat sheddings. Also, if your food or water  \happens to be running out before you clean it, refill it asap.<br>  <br>  Also, you will need to make the rat in a standing position. You will need to look under it to check if it's a boy or girl. You will know if you're about perhaps 11 ages +<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the whole Heater thing. I leave my Heater (Plugged in) in my room on the warm/not too hot switch so its about 70ish degrees. Rats like the temperature perfect.<br>  <br>  Go for holding it. Make it toys, let it explore where it lives in. I let my hyper rat jump around on my bed. She pees at times, but not much. An awesome website for rat activities and toys that I use for my little one is; <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dapper.com.au/toys.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dapper.com.au/toys.htm</a>                     <--- wicked website.<br>  <br>  Well, good luck with your little one. Rats are SOOO much more friendlier, outgoing, cuter, and love able that hamsters, guinea pigs, and other various rodents. Don't freak out if he/she is licking you, that's their own version of kisses. Also, if they nip, it's usually their teeth that are large rubbing against you.<br>  <br>  Once again, good luck!<br>  <br>  -Julz|`|UlOKMInqaa	An aquarium type cage isn't the best for a rat. A wire cage is much better. An aquarium tank doesn't provide for much ventilation and ammonia from the rat's urine builds up much faster which is bad for the rat. That is probably why it smells so bad. You should also be cleaning the tank at least once a week, probably twice a week for an aquarium. <br>  <br>  Rats are social creatures and if you plan on keeping this rat you will want to consider getting it a playmate. If it's a female, get another female. If it's a male, get another male. If you plan on keeping a male with a female you will need to get them fixed so you don't end up with unplanned pregnancies!<br>  <br>  You can go to any pet store and get rat food. Lab blocks should be the staple of their diet but you can get seed mixes for variety, as well. I have three females. I feed them rat food in the morning and some of my dinner for an evening snack. Fruits and veggies are good for them but should not be their main diet. Carrots, peas, mashed potatoes, cooked butternut squash, apples, bananas (ripe not green), cooked rice, cooked pasta, and cheerios are all appropriate snacks. A water bottle is a good way to provide water for your rats since they will usually knock over or pee in a water dish. This can easily be hung in a wire cage. Providing hammocks, cubes, and toys in their cage are a must. Rats love "cave-like" housing. 70-75 degrees is a good temperature for rats. Too cold and they can catch a cold or get pneumonia, too hot and they can overeat. They are very sensitive to temperature. A good bedding for them is "eco fresh" brand. You should never use wood chips or shavings as it is bad for their respiratory system.<br>  <br>  You can definitely hold your rat! If it is shy, you will have to work with him to get him to trust you. Letting him feed from your hands will help build trust. Never hold a rat by its tail. This can cause degloving (the skin to come off) and is very painful for the rat and will result in a trip to the vet's. When picking your rat up, use one hand on the bottom supporting his feet and your other hand on top to help him to feel secure. An hour of play time in a secure area with your rat is best. Females tend to be more active and curious while males are more relaxed and are usually more willing to be hold and cuddled.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|XurYYreBaa	The little guy should be in a bigger tank, or even better, a cage for play room & healthy ventilation.  Part of the smell is b/c of the tank he's in.  "Small" feeder rats are young & won't be small for long.<br>  Don't use cedar or pine bedding for your rat's floor, both are very bad for their health.  We use Carefresh Ultra but there are a lot of good beddings to choose from.  Give him/her paper towels to make a nest with & a box to play & sleep in.  When you get a cage, you can give your rat a hammock to relax in.  All our rats love their hammocks.<br>  You don't need to heat the tank, normal room temperature is fine & don't forget that rats are found in nearly all climates.<br>  Most pet stores have packaged rat food but we give ours a little vegetarian dog kibble mixed with an assortment of whole grains.  The grains include millet & buckwheat from the natural food store, unsweetened cereal & bread which we sometimes toast for variety.  Our rats also get a small amount of vegetables or fruit a few times a week.  Treats include sunflower seeds, dog biscuits & a taste of whatever we're eating unless it's not good for them.  For example, anything high in sugar or fat is bad & oranges aren't good for male rats.<br>  Although rats can drink water from a dish, a water bottle from the pet store will keep the water much cleaner & your rat won't be spilling it that way.<br>  Rats are smart, social & curious.  They learn their names & you can teach them tricks. They can make awesome companions & if they trust you they can be very affectionate.  It might take a little time & patience to gain your rat's trust, or the little guy could be your friend right away.  Socialized rats enjoy sitting on your shoulder, getting petted or tickled & even wrestling with your hand like a kitten would.|`|KToEYmwWaa	You need a way bigger cage and a same gender little rat friend for him/her.  If there are no testicles, its a girl.  It sounds to me like you and your friend have no idea how to care for rats.  You have lots of research to do.
scdOdaTKaa	If your dog was still eating, drinking and showing signs of enjoyment then he probably wasn't suffering too badly. Lymphoma is not known to be a painful cancer but a weakening cancer, it wears on their immune system and tires them out.  You probably made the right decision, letting your dog go out with a bang while he felt good and was happy.  Sometimes people let it go too long, then the dog is miserable and it is hard for the owner to see them liek that and they tend to remember them that way.  I'm so very sorry for your loss. I comend you for doing the chemo as not many people are willing to.  I hope you enjoyed the last 10 months you had with him.|`|eDySIDPQaa	I am very sorry for you loss, it's very hard to let them go..<br>  <br>  <br>  and the type of cancer your dog had, can be painful as the tumors enlarge...the spreading of them...<br>  <br>  I had my Pepper, a Min. Schnauzer, a show chanpion, he developed Testical cancer in 2004 in Feb....we did all the treatments, all the meds they had to give him...he would eat, play and act so fine.<br>  <br>  but near the end, which was September 8, 2004, he was not doing well, he would each day seem to drink and eat a little less, then on this day, I got up to take him out, my boy could not stand up, he was just looking me in the eyes, and I could see he was saying, it't time mom...I called my husband, he came home from work, we took Pepper to our vet, he said yes, it was time, he could not stand up at all, just fell over in the rear area...<br>  <br>  They gave him his shot to put him down, my boy never once took his eyes off of me, I was holding him when they gave him his shot, as his eyes closed he was still focused on me...then he was gone and I could not let go of him..I sat there for 2 hrs holding my boy...<br>  <br>  If your vet said it was time,it was time, they can tell, and if the tumors were not shrinking but growing, yes he was in pain.<br>  <br>  You did the right thing, now that baby is not suffering any longer, and the baby thanks you for that.....he will always be with you,watching over you....<br>  <br>  and you will always have the wonderful memories that the two of you made together and shared....be happy you had him in your life for as long as you did.....but, yes you did the right thing.<br>  <br>  I had Pepper cremated, and he is on my desk in the den is always sitting by me...he is everywhere I go, in my heart, my memories, my life, he will never be forgotten<br>  <br>  It will take time to help you heal...but there is not a day that will go by, that you will not remember your best friend..<br>  <br>  I know it does not seem like it now, but you need another dog when your ready to help through it....and your dog will want you to, and not to be alone.......<br>  <br>  but remember, he is right there by your side every step for the rest of your life<br>  <br>  good luck|`|443578ac145c721ca967e548ac55f900aa	If he was suffering, you would have known if you heard him "whimper".  Whimpering meant he was hurting.  <br>  <br>  I had two golden retrievers, a mother and her son.  The mother, Lady Prancer, passed away with cancer in her back leg.  I didn't wait for it to get worse and would never have had the leg amputated, ever.  Her son, Goldleaves Comet, wound up getting cancer after his mother had it.  He had Carsenoma (sp?) cancer.  He went blind, and though he seemed happy and was able to eat, pee, and walk around and out the doggie door to do his business and return inside again.......I refused to have him suffer in any way.  Neither one suffered as I had them on one of the strongest medication pills I could possibly have them on.  Prancer whimpered one evening very lightly, and I got her on the medication as quickly as I could!   No suffering.  <br>  <br>  So......if he whimpered (dogs can withstand much more pain than humans can withstand), he may have experienced some pain.  A good thing and a blessing your family put him down and into peace.  A wonderful place for him to be, and he's with my two goldens now.  <br>  <br>  :oP|`|Hwybmzg5aa	Don't think he would of suffered that much.It sounds like he was very happy with his life he is probably thankful that you stop his suffering.<br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss my prayers are with you and your dog.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I think you made the right decisions for him.

Braid part of the leg wrap in with the hair and tie the rest around the tail.  Leave the side hairs free from being braided and make sure that the top of the tail is not done too tight.|`|CoAc5hS9aa	I show my morgan horse and of course morgans are famous for their extremely long tails. I wrap my horse's tail with vet wrap. Your horse won't be able to get that out. The only downside is you have to keep it in for months at a time. Changing it only every 2-3 months.<br>  <br>  After you have washed, dried, and brushed your horse's tail follow these steps-<br>  <br>  1.  Start by braiding your horse's tail, starting about 3 inches from the tail bone. Start loose at the top then make it tighter as you work your way away from the tail bone. When you get about 3 inches from the end of the tail put a hair band (one you would put in your hair) in it.<br>  <br>  2.  Now fold the braid once in half and wrap it tightly in one whole roll of vet wrap. Wrap another hair band around where the end of the vet wrap is so it doesn't unravel (which it shouldn't).<br>  <br>  Well.. It is pretty simple. Just redo it in about 2-3 months. Your horse will have a very pretty tail. =D|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	Are you talking about when your riding or the day before the show?

If ur used to braiding tails ur prolly not doing it too tight or loose so that it bugs her but if she's never had a braided tail it may feel strange to her.  Could u maybe braid her tail and then do it up like u would a broodmare's tail with a polo wrap around the top (where the tail bone is), course then she wouldn't be able to swat flies but she wouldn't be able to get it down either.  U need to watch that after u get a braid to stay in that she doesn't go to rubbing her tail bone on things (like trees and fences or the stall wall) to get the braid out.  I'll see if i can post links to the other two braids i talked about.  If u try them pratice a few times, if it is left too tight it could kill your horses tail and make it fall completely off as well as just being uncomfortable much like a tight ponytail would be for you.|`|XnNCNAORaa	If you can't keep it braided then just go out every or every other day and brush it out nice maybe use some detangler or watered down conditioner and spritz it on with a squirt bottle? (I personally don't like braiding my horses tails because have you ever been swatted with one? If you get it at the right time it'll leave a welt x.x Also, their tail loose makes a better fly swatter than just being one solid braid.)<br>  <br>  Or, my friend turned me onto some stuff called Cowboy Magic. The stuff is GREAT and it only takes a tiny tiny bit to get the job done. It helps detangle their main/tail, it makes it very shiny, and helps keep it soft and supple when used right =] I do suggest trying it, that's what I use! ^^<br>  <br>  If the flys are bad then maybe some flyspray so she'll be less inclined to swat constantly at herself?|`|oQmL4IdWaa	This is what I do. <br>  <br>  Take an old bed sheet cut two pieces about 6-10 inches wide.  make one piece the whole length of the sheet or about 2x as long as her tail, plus about 12-24  inches extra.  Make the next piece a little longer than half the length of the long one.  Now fold the long piece in half and then fold a couple inches of your short piece over the middle of the long piece so you have 3 long pieces of sheet about the same length attached at the top.. You could sew it if you wanted, but I just fold it over.<br>  <br>  Now, with her tail tangle free, clean, dry and conditioned take your sheets and snug the top behind her tail and just under the tail bone.  divide the tail into three sections giving each section of hair a section of sheet, and braid a couple braids to secure it and then start wrapping and or folding the hair into the sheet pieces as you braid so all the hair is protected inside the sheet.  Keep the sheet snug around the tail (the hair, not the bone).  Braid until you run out of tail, keeping the hair wrapped in the sheet. You should have some sheet left.  <br>  <br>  I tie it off by tying a basic square or granny knot between two pieces of sheet and then tie another knot between one of the already used pieces and the remaining piece.  trim the excess sheet so that it doesn't drag on the ground, but leave some as a fly swatter.<br>  <br>  That being said, sometimes shorter tails grow better when they are just left out.  Braiding, bagging, etc protects the length on a tail, but it will break some hairs and make the tail a bit thinner.<br>  <br>  Some horses just don't grow a lot of tail, but make sure she is parasite free, and is eating a balanced diet.  You could try feeding her a biotin supplement and veggie oil.<br>  <br>  Also make sure you aren't breaking tail hair by brushing it to often or too harshly.  Make sure you pick out the tangles so you don't break hair, and use a silicone free moisturizer such as Healthy Hair care Moisturizer.
6SeWCfUfaa	Yea, the muzzle is wrong.  Especially since the 4am thing is your fault.<br>  <br>  Yes, your fault.  You responded to it the first time so now the pup knows that if it barks at 4am you'll get up with it.  You're just going to have to start ignoring that.  If you'd ignored it the very first time it happened and continued to ignore it, it would not be the problem it is today.<br>  <br>  So ... skip the muzzle, that's just crule and grit your teeth, find some ear plugs, do what you gotta do to ignore the dog until an hour that you want to have your dog getting up.  It will take a while, but as soon as the pup figures out that barking does not get your attention, it will stop.|`|xQsMPtFGaa	dont muzzle her overnight!!!<br>  try covering her cage with a blanket<br>  or maybe shes ready to sleep outside of the cage at night.<br>  you should try that!|`|QbaP2m9jaa	go to address bar and type in   mike2009.webs.com   for gaming news|`|31wQMeMcaa	You could try putting some coins in a metal pan with a lid and whenever your dog barks shake the can really loudly. Be consistent and shake the can whenever she barks at any time throughout the day. I know it might be hard to do this at 4 in the morning but maybe if you do it during the day or at night enough she will associate the scary noise with her barking so she might stop. It might seem mean to scare her but it is better than using a muzzle overnight. Also, if she barks at 4 or at any time, don't let her out because that is teaching her that barking means she can get what she wants.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi is there any way you could let her sleep in your bedroom with you whether on your bed or in her cage beside your bed?  That way she would be near you and feel more safe.  A muzzle is a terrible thing to have on a dog.  I would rather see a person get a bark collar and use that than a muzzle.  I think what is going to happen if you use the muzzle is you will get her to feeling she is being punished and the behaviors might get worse as she acts out against it.  Just keep her closer to you at least try it and then if it doesn't work then get a bark collar for her.  Good Luck!|`|ZoeS825Kaa	Yeah the muzzle isn't fixing the problem, it's just masking it. <br>  Unfortunately you have to correct her as soon as she starts barking.<br>  Don't do it by talking or trying to reason with her, cause she's a dog it doesn't work. I know it sounds obvious but people always try to reason with their dog.  You have to physically correct her every time, it doesn't mean hit her, it means tug on her collar or turn her on her back, just something to remind her that you are boss and you dont like her barking. DO NOT GIVE IN TO HER BARKING BY LETTING HER OUT, CAUSE SHE IS GETTING EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS|`|TPWs85H1aa	The trick for this takes a while but it works. Teach the dog to speak through positive reinforcement. every time he barks say speak, then reward him. then teach him to bark for his toy or for his food then follow that by enough!  then you can just use the word enough. also placing her in a crate at night with a blanket over it will silence your 4 am wake up call.|`|UURuejLtaa	Call The Dog Whisperer, Caesar.|`|rWGzVUxOaa	I would try to tire her out before bed by running around with her that way she gets sleep.  Try to only put the muzzle on right when she barks at night that way shell get the idea that if she barks, on comes the muzzle.  If its a lab it should learn quickly but keep in mind that all puppies are going to bark when they need something whether it be attention, to go pee, or food/water so try to satisfy those needs before bed and train her while shes young not to do these things so that shell be a good dog when she gets older not that all dogs aren't good dogs.
26PPwzrWaa	Not reputable typically. If you do your research, you might get lucky, but 99% of the time it is bybs and mills advertising. Same with craigslist and kijji(sp?).|`|SkgJYDaCaa	i know a very good breeder who is also a dog trainer. she doesn't advertise her dogs at all. breeders who care about their puppies wouldn't post them online for any random person to buy. good breeders will go to the house and check out the possible living conditions as well as interview the future pet parents. i wouldn't trust a website for anything unless it's local and you can go visit the puppy at their house. i think irresponsible breeders and puppy mills use the internet to make a quick buck. <br>  <br>  a few months ago, this family had like 5 pitbull puppies they were selling on the side of a really busy road. i couldn't believe that they could be so careless as to who gets their puppies. especially pitbulls when there are so many horror stories of fighting them. i think irresponsible local breeders are just as bad as puppy mills.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	Puppy mill.

Out of the 20+ dogs I have on the farm two of them smell pretty badly. They also have very oily skin. Try getting a dog shampoo for oily skin. You may have to go to a real pet store or even get a prescription from a vet, This will help a whole lot, also try drying it with a blow dryer,this will also help. Good luck.|`|3fur16Rgaa	no matter what shampoo you use they always end up smelling the same.  i have this natural dog spray i got at PetCo, its a perfume that smells like sugar cookies i spray my dogs after i brush them every few days. it keeps the mats away and i get a dog biscuit.(get it? they smell like cookies? nevermind it was corny anyhow)|`|XC36OOiTaa	You should have your dog examined by a veterinarian.

Get his temp up to around 78-80, this is the best range for them, they are a tropical fish after all.  Betta can TOLERATE being cold, but they don't WANT to be cold, and just like us, being too cold for too long can lead tot a whole host of health issues. Most pet stores will sell a small 14 dollar heating pad that should do the trick, it's slim and can be placed against a wall or under the gravel.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|AA11708471	Bettas are active when kept in proper conditions<br>  <br>  proper conditions means a 20+ litre filtered and heated aquarium|`|7KxQXHzOaa	If it is a boy it will have long flowing fins and tail.  Their water temperature should be 72-80 degrees F.  their ph level is 7.0.  they are not that active and will swim slowly and steadily.  if it does not eat in a day or 2 than you should do some research.  They also need a 2 or more gallon tank.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	Betta fish aren't active fish, they are very peaceful ( when alone! ) fish.<br>  <br>  Don't expect much from a little fish with pretty fins, get more serious and invest in a 55 gallon Oscar tank!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|kKSpHtDWaa	Bettas don't tend to do much unless there's another betta, in which case they go into attack mode.  He's fine.  Now if there starts to appear white spots, ragged fins, or other stuff, then there's issues.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	warm the tank to 80 F, put a mirror for the fish to see it self|`|1YNhKzeqaa	He needs a tank so you can set up proper filtration and heating. Betas are tropical fish and prefer a water temperature of 72 degrees Fahrenheit. Fish are cold blooded and need proper temperatures to be active and to carry out necessary body functions. You will probably notice he wont eat quite as much, this is also due to cooler temperatures.<br>  <br>  If you don't get him a nice sized tank with heat and filtration, he will remain lethargic.<br>  When you set up the filter, be sure the current it produces is not too strong, as betas prefer slow moving water, and strong currents can tear up their fins.<br>  <br>  You can even get him some tank mates that don't have flowy fins but wont nip at his fins. Like bottom feeders and algae eaters. (but don't plan on getting a pleco unless you plan on getting a 50 gal.)<br>  Guppies are an example of a fish with flowy fins, and danios are an example of a fin nipping fish.|`|IgG5PPjRaa	its fine. bettas are not noturiously active fish. DO NOT PUT A MIRROR IN THE TANK!!! THis is a form of training for fighting Bettas. The betta will most likely attack the mirror or glass of the tank until it cracks or its head cracks. warming the water may healp, just be sure to keep it under 80. ideally it should be between 74 and 79 degrees for optimum health, but it can drop to 70 or go up to 80 before you get serious health problems.|`|gC8NFODSaa	Yeah, he's okay. He'll move around a little more soon when he gets over the change of scenery and realizes he actually can move around now that he's out of that little tiny cup. It's true, they do not tend to do much unless they see another betta, either with a mirror as previously mentioned or another betta. We have three bettas and we keep them all side-by-side on the counter so they can see each other. However, never put two bettas in the same container because they will fight!|`|f4df9712869843dd814c1e02d77242eaaa	nah, bettas don't swim around much at all.  it's best to keep them in a very small tank...not very big at all.
qOiv8d3Laa	Grab the nearest thing to catch the throw-up in!  If you can't catch it, you'll have to clean it up!  I always say you KNOW you're REALLY a "kitty-Mom" when you find yourself catching your cat's throw-up in your HANDS!<br>  <br>  Anyhow... My one cat throws up because he eats too fast.  The ONLY way to control it is to literally control how much he eats.  Let him eat for only a couple of minutes, and remove the food.  Repeat the process periodically throughout the day so he eats his "sufficient" amount of food for the total day, but only in small portions.  This should help.  It doesn't matter if the food is wet or dry.<br>  <br>  <br>  Me... kittyslave23... I know my place.|`|UETAqR8Taa	could there be a reason he may think that someone or another animal may get to his food before he finnishes.<br>  <br>  or let him eat a bit, take the food away, then put it back say 15-30 min later to finnish. should stop the regurgitrate and put him in a habit of not eating so fast in the long run|`|LURQBU86aa	One technique that sometimes works is getting a tray( like a cafeteria tray) and spread his food out on the tray. That way it is harder for him to eat so quickly.
OyNJTWaiaa	The aviary you have might seem large to you, but it really is too small for the amount of birds you will have in it. To add another galah to the mixed aviary and a nesting box or more if you plan on breeding the others too, will create chaos. Its would be considered too small for just flight area for the birds you are cramming into it but adding a nesting box and the other galah, will create stress conditions, territorial fights and deaths and illness.<br>  If you wish to proceed, then the aviary will be fine for a pair of breeding galahs ( at a pinch ) BUT only if all other birds are removed as well. <br>  It seems you havent yet done enough research on your future breeding plans, and you would also need to know their ages, health conditions, breeding season, etc. You have already begun badly by adding a new bird to an aviary with existing birds without any thought or care taken to quarantine the new bird from your existing flock. A sure way to introduce hidden diseases. Add the stress of breeding to the mix and you end up with sick or dead birds. <br>  Please think hard about what you are doing, and try not to "bite the hand that feeds you" by ripping into people who may know more than you do and are only on here to try and help others.<br>  <br>  <br>  ** Shop owners who are about to sell you a  bird will tell you anything you want to hear and not necessarily the truth.|`|8FjfLfiBaa	Don't even think about breeding birds until you have studied everything that's involved. Don't expect the people here to give you a crash course.<br>  You don't even know what questions to ask.<br>  <br>  If you are thinking that raising exotic birds is a quick and easy way to make money, you are SO wrong. Find another "get rich quick" scheme, preferably one that does not involve any living creatures.
369F0dYfaa	My cat used to do this all the time and it turned out in my case that it was just lonely. whenever i got another cat she stopped meowing. another possibility is that if its an inside cat and saw another cat outside it could just want out. and a third thing is that maybe your cat wants to mate(yes im serious about that last answer).|`|AA10411829	There are a number of possibilities.<br>  1] Your cat may be sick and needs a vet to look him over.<br>  2] He may have been scared somehow; this could have been by another animal or he may even be in heat. If he's in heat, he may also start to urinate in one spot or on furniture.<br>  3] One other possibility is that he may be scared from sensing an impending storm or earthquake. Do you live in an area where earthquakes happen? Or where that may be a storm or tornado area?<br>  Are there other animals making a fuss in the neighborhood?|`|vqQsvy4kaa	Are you sure it's a boy?

He is at the age where that may start to happen.  <br>  <br>  I would start with supervised visits, with muzzles on, when you actually start to let them together.  No treats, food or toys when they are together.  Those will only cause an increased urge for competition.  <br>  <br>  And then talk to your vet about a good trainer of behavior consultant that might be able to be at your house when you start to re-introduce, so that you do the right things.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	You should read about dogs and aggression. There is some reason that happened but I can't tell you why. You need to read the dog's communications to one another. <br>  I suggest that you join the Yahoo group called "Agbeh", you must ask to join, and read the success stories and the links.

Or, it may be that they smell a B***h in heat and are really flexing their dominant genes. (They will do this to some extent even though they are both neutered. Check out your community for this possibility. It that's the case, they should be ok in a few days. And, sometimes they just get in a fight. Their memories of incidents is pretty short, anbd they may be OK from now on.<br>  <br>  One of the dogs could be sick and not feeling well and doesn't want to be annoyed. Check that out too.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I have five house dogs, and it's imperative that they get along, but sometimes they get in knock-down drag out fights.

YAPEpa5baa	Mine lived  about 2 weeks shy of living with us for 2 years.  He was about 2 months old when we got him.  So just over 2 years.<br>  <br>  On average they live about 2 years.  Most people have Syrian hamsters that live 6 months to 3 years.  It depends on the cage, care, diet, love, etc.<br>  <br>  Find a healthy food mix that isn't full of sunflower seeds, and doesn't contain Ethoxyquin.  That rules out all Kaytee food products.  Sunflower seeds are like the McDonalds of rodent junk food and high in fat.  A few here and there as a treat are fine, but everyday as the main staple of the food is not good, or healthy.  Ethoxyquin is a pesticide that causes cancer in humans, and is used as a preservative in some brands of pet food (as in ALL Kaytee foods).<br>  <br>  Don't use pine or cedar as a bedding.  Use a cage that has air flow, vs. a bin or aquarium.  Make sure the hamster has an appropriate size wheel for exercise.  Get him hand tame if he's not.  Give him attention, love and care, plus time out of his cage everyday.  If you use a hamster ball - limit the time to about 10 minutes and then wash the ball out.<br>  <br>  Clean the cage thoroughly once a week and don't use harmful or scented chemicals for cleaning.  Vinegar is a perfectly safe cleanser.  Hydrogen Peroxide works with it, but used separately, as a disinfectant.  Get a spare food dish and water bottle, so you can change them out and properly clean them every week, at least.<br>  <br>  Give your hamster some fresh foods to supplement the lousy store bought food.|`|TeJU7MQ4aa	Usually its between 3 to 5 yrs.But a friend of mine had 1 for 8 yrs.He was a pet,she never bred him,just spent time with him,kept him clean and fed him healthy hamster food.|`|2owUaw1paa	Quagmire: Long enough to have sex with giggity giggity<br>  <br>  Around 2-3 years<br>  <br>  Just make sure he is well fed and happy.|`|RDjUl06Oaa	Ive had mine for 3 years|`|HW8ybM2Paa	2-3 years|`|eCNrkHqiaa	my hamster only lasted 6 months|`|8MTN47C9aa	I bought two at the same time and they lived for over two years.

You don't want them to put a ban on Akitas because of your dog, you want your dog to be an ambassador against BSL.
2P5WRadhaa	Well, your expenses, licensing fees, and cost of liability insurance you'll have to get will determine that. You'll need some dog-behavioral training,  a course in how to properly handle dogs when walking, how many dogs can you handle at one time, based on their size and demeanor and social interaction with the othher dogs. knowledge of leash and poop-clean up laws, and of the acceptable areas you can walk a dog in your locality.  You'll need liability insurance in case the dog gets injured while in your care, or in case you lose it. You can also charge depending on the size and demeanor of the dog. Probably 12 - 20 bucks an hour would be a good starting place, but, like I say, it depends on your expenses involved in getting set up legally and effectively.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your venture.

Sometimes they nibble out of curiosity.<br>  <br>  If you mean "biting", as in hard & it hurts, then I suggest you take your piggie to the vet for a checkup. Guinea pigs are not biters. Biting is usually an indication of pain.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Ours bites once then stops.|`|VNDMbJIZaa	It bites sometime but normally its very soft<br>  it will soon stop believe me|`|D75FlRukaa	Maybe its hungry or mad... or maybe it needs its teeth trimmed

Good for you for adopting!! Maybe get a ball, some treats, a Kong toy and some peanut butter to put in it, a squeaky toy.  A soft bed or cushion for him/her to sleep in. You may want a crate to keep the dog in when you pop out to the store.  a few bowls, some poop bags. <br>  <br>  <br>  Why kind of dog did you adopt? How is he/she doing?|`|TWfDAYK4aa	Collar and leash, of course.  Food and water dishes.  Crate or kennel, depending what you call it.  Toys, lots of toys.  And most important, good quality food, not cheap grocery store stuff, but something worthwhile spending your money one.  Innova would be a good choice.  <br>  Wishing you the best with your new dog.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Well what is on your list already? You should have all the things you need BEFORE getting the dog.|`|TPWs85H1aa	You need a Crate that is dog sized, two dishes, one for water and one for food, you need a collar, a leash, nail trimmer, toothbrush, dog tooth paste, and a good vet. You also should get your dog checked up with in 72 hours of adoption to see if it's healthy (kennel cough and all). I also suggest crate training. Good job on adopting. If you take your paperwork of the adoption into petco you will get a coupon book with over $240 of savings. I also suggest a high quality dog food like Natural Balance or Nutro. The name brands have more fat content than nutrition. Check the label for the food amount. Also don't go too healthy like Blue because dogs don't like the taste and wont eat it.|`|kN0Qr52Jaa	Well, dog food is an essential. If it's a pup, get specifically puppy food. It will need those nutrients. A dog food bowl, a water dish, a leash, a collar (possibly get a tag to go with it. You can make one for a few bucks at Wal-Mart.) Dog shampoo, doggie treats (not really a necessity) Dog brush, Dog nail clippers, Training pads if you want it potty trained inside, maybe a dog carrier, and anything else you WANT for your dog to spoil it.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi congratulations on your new dog,  some of the things that will be important to have are:  collar and leash, brush and comb, flea collar or the vials, shampoo and conditioner, bowls for food and water, dog food, toys, chew bones, toothbrush and dog toothpaste, vitamins, if a small dog a few coats for cold weather, puppy papers if a puppy, baby gate to keep in bathroom while your gone, q-tips for cleaning ears, toenail trimmers, clippers if you are going to trim the dog, blanket or bed for him to lay on and LOTS OF LOVE  Good Luck!|`|0k2QYM0eaa	you didn't say how old the dog is, so some of these items may not apply. First of all be sure that the dog has the right food appropriate for it's age. Be sure the dog has access to clean water at all times. A nice soft comfortable bed near where you sleep will help the dog feel comfortable at night. Next are toys to keep him busy when you can't play with him, and depending on his age, something he can chew on. There are endless number of toys to buy for him. Just because the store sells them, doesn't mean that it can't hurt him. Wires, batteries, cardboard and others harmful items are in many dog toys. Be sure to pick one that won't hurt him if you are not right there watching him. A good toy I've found on the internet is called a Muttmop. It is a great chew and tug a war toy to play with. Be sure to get his shots up to date. The worst thing is to become attached to a wonderful dog and then lose them because it he wasn't vaccinated. Also pick up some treats so that when he is a good boy he will be rewarded. I personally use hotdogs. They are cheap, dogs love them, and they last a long time in the frig. Buy a dog brush and brush him regularly. This helps to keep him clean between baths, and helps to spread his skin oils through his fur to keep it shiny. A good leash is also nice to have. Be sure the leash is strong enough to hold him. IF you have to pull really hard to keep him from maybe running into the street, you don't want it to break. And also get him used to being bathed. It is so much easier to give a dog a bath when he is not fighting you. I hope this helps|`|GEXxB6Sjaa	collar and leash. food and water bowl.  good brand food, not grocery store brand.  get food at the pet store.  stuff for him/her to chew on and lots of toys.  make sure you get him a tag with his name on it and your contact number.  getting a kennel would be a good idea and crate train him, you will be happy that you did.

They gulped air. Leave them alone to fart and burp it off, unless they are crying and in pain and discomfort. In that case you need to feed them slower and in a shallow dish and apart from one another so they dont think another pup will take there food. IF they are crying and in pain... you might need to take them into a vet to be sure they haven't twisted there stomachs.<br>  <br>  Do not soak pupppy chow in COWS MILK.. if you want to give them more nutrition then get Dog Milk Replacer or Esbilac from a store and use that.
2P5WRadhaa	Why don't you try a rescue shelter? You can find great dogs, sometimes full blooded, and the cost is minimal compared to some of the outrageous puppy-mill prices you'll pay for high-strung full blooded breeds.

So much that nobody on here can hope to give you good estimates.  What you need to do first is figure out which breed you really want.  Then contact breeders and start talking to them.

So it's important to find the breed you like, then find a breeder that has a breeding program you approve of.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	WOW...you sure are coming off a little aggressive here don't you think?Turn off the !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  You seem a little confused on what you want.

Pure breeds can cost from 500 to 3000 or more. I won't give you an estimate on a puggle, because irreesponsible breeders and puppy mills only breed those. <br>  <br>  The others ones it really depends on where you are, if they are common in your area, etc. <br>  <br>  Needless to say, do not buy from a backyard breeder or a pet store (because those dogs come from puppy mills).<br>  <br>  Get one from a reputable breeder (one from, for example, the Jack Russell Club of America or whatever) that gives you a spay-neuter contract, asks you lots of questions and screens you to make sure you get the right dog for your lifestyle, etc. <br>  <br>  Also try petfinder.com. Try your local shelter (there are lots of pure breeds in shelters!) Try a breed-specific rescue group in your area. All of their fees are cheaper.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have the 700+ dollars every year for a dog's expenses before you get a dog okay?|`|IJr0MR1Aaa	By the range of breeds you're asking about, you must not be researching characteristics and comparing them to your wants and lifestyle.  You should first make a list of characteristics you desire and ones you don't want, then research the breeds.  Things such as coat care, energy level, barking, aggression level, gets along with other animals/people.<br>  <br>  For example: Maltese take very knowledgeable coat care.  Did you know that if you bath them without a thorough comb out first, they will matt severely?  Schipperkes are extremely high energy and Parson's Russell Terriers not far behind.  Chihuahuas are often aggressive if not raised by someone they perceive as being the alpha over them.  They are also hard too housebreak and often too smart for their own good.  Beagles bay.<br>  <br>  These things should be considered first.  Once you have a short list, check out prices.  Look for breeders, not pet stores.  Find many breeders directories on-line or check with the AKC.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	*Thanks for the attitude in your question itself.<br>  <br>  Depends who and where you buy it from. Reputable breeders will obviously charge more, but it is sure worth it because you'll raise a great, well-bred dog. "Puggles" are designer dogs and will most likely come from a BYB, probably costing more than they should. Shelters are always a great place for first time owners, or just about anyone willing to give a dog a second chance. They usually charge from 100-250 dollars.<br>  If you fall for a breeder online who sells 'toy' or 'teacup' (mostly maltese, chihuahua, or yorkies), you'll pay anywhere from 800-2500 dollars. <br>  <br>  So, to sum it all up: your price ranges from 100-2500 dollars, depending on who & where you buy your dog.<br>  <br>  Yorkies are just a short nickname for a Yorkshire Terrier.|`|1WmDOPGtaa	I'm really not much help on the subject, but have only one bit of insight.  Of all the breeds you listed, the Schipperke is likely to be the most expensive.  It's a less common breed, and therefore a bit harder to find.  That said, they're fantastic dogs (and I'm really not a fan of small dogs).  My sister had one for many years and he won me over!|`|zWjXXLSOaa	It all depends on where your getting the dog from.

If you do get Cichlids make sure to get the same species, African and South American Cichlids can not be put together because the African kind are more aggressive and will most likely kill the S. Americans. And also if you get Cichlids be sure to get them all close to the same size if you put a smaller one in with a bigger the bigger will eat the smaller one. And also if you get an algae eater make sure you get a Pocastamus rather than snails, the cichlids will eat the snails but will leave the Pocastamus alone as long as you put the Pocastamus in the tank 1st before the Cichlids. Even though it seems like a lot to deal with i think its worth it because eventually you will get used to it and after a couple of years whenever they get too big you can sell them to Pet Stores for Store credit and can start over again with more fish and supplie.|`|39mwvo8Yaa	Don't forget to add water!

Now, to answer your question, you should definitely get two hamsters, preferably both female, but two males would do too. Don't get a male and female as they will breed very quickly. Dwarfs are very sociable creatures, and if you only get one, unless you handle it at least twice a day, it will get very depressed.

CACiIkS6aa	First of all, make sure you have a large enough cage. The minimum requirements are 30" by 50" for 2 guinea pigs. If the cage is not big enough, take it outside in the backyard daily for some running around. Your local pet store should probably have harnesses which you can attach to your pig, like leashes for dogs. Those will make outdoor activity safe.<br>  <br>  Your cage should have a small hutch or hiding place for your pigs. Try also to get cardboard chubes for it to run around. Some bird or rabbit toys work for piggies too. MAKE SURE that you don't give it an exercise ball or wheel like hamsters, because guinea pig's spines arent as flexable, and these wheels will hurt them. <br>  <br>  Have fun with your piggie!|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Local pet stores will carry wood type pieces that are safe for Guinea Pigs to chew on.

You really should have done some research before getting them. It is always a good idea to make sure you know what fish are compatible before adding them to your tank. Chiclids are agressive fish and should only be housed with other chiclids. You can google to see what fish are compatible. Your tank is a community tank so i would only go with the types of fish that are communtiy. Most pet stores should be able to tell you which species those are.

Your local pet store should probably have harnesses which you can attach to your pig, like leashes for dogs. Those will make outdoor activity safe.<br>  <br>  Your cage should have a small hutch or hiding place for your pigs. Try also to get cardboard chubes for it to run around. Some bird or rabbit toys work for piggies too. Having wooden chews or treats make them happy and content.  MAKE SURE that you don't give it an exercise ball or wheel like hamsters, because guinea pig's spines arent as flexible, and these wheels will hurt them. <br>  <br>  Have fun with your piggie!|`|nrHY3JRMaa	I have had guinea pigs all my life and i think the best thing to do is get it a friend as you are getting 3 they should be pretty well occupied. There aren't many toys for them on the market but just a block of wood keeps them occupied because they chew on it, it is also great for them too keep their teeth clean!<br>  hope that helps a bit :)|`|eaV0ip24aa	You should get them a wheel. It can be noisy, but they really like it. As for chewing, my chinchilla has these things called Natural Nibblers, they are pieces of wood that he really enjoys and it is supposed to help with dental hygiene. So those are two inexpensive things. (The wheel is about 20 bucks but it will last you for a while. The Natural Nibblers are about 5 bucks a package and it has quite a few pieces in it.)|`|ySLO1SnIaa	give them a hamster wheel and use it for your guinea pigs|`|r20s3s7Haa	I just got a guinea pig baby today :) Man there so awesome!  Just get them some little wooden blocks and maybe a pet bed or something like that.  My mom made two little beds for my pig and also I bought little ABC Wooden blocks for it to chew on!
cgctTeK7aa	Some cats just stop purring. It's used for many different reasons; fear, happiness, anger, etc. It's nothing out of the ordinary. I feel safe saying she still loves you.|`|caExWxHbaa	ALL CATS PURR someare louder than others so you just can't hear her purr.  If you put your index finger and middle finger together and put them on her neck, you can feel the vibration.|`|PRvtZK3Iaa	well if it's a really young kitten then it might not purr yet cause kittens are all hyper and stuff and cats purr when there relaxed so maybe your kittens to hyper or not relaxing but wait a while and if not then it might be purring and you might not hear it so put your hand on it's neck and feel!!!
lZevLfjhaa	He's making a bubble nest. It's nothing to worry about and could mean one of two things (or both):<br>  -he is simply very happy or<br>  -he is ready to mate.<br>  You don't have to worry about anything. Even if it is because he is ready to mate you don't have to get him a mate (which I wouldn't recommend doing unless you know how to mate them properly and how to care for the babies). He will stop doing this eventually and may start doing it randomly. <br>  It's totally normal behavior.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	He's happy!...or ready to 'mate'.|`|KtQphX1Taa	Male bettas make "bubble nests," which they put their eggs in. Even if your fish hasn't mated, they still will do this because it's their natural instinct. Normally, they make these nests to put their eggs in for safekeeping.<br>  It's probably a good sign, and your fish is healthy :]|`|fLUwsXBiaa	That is just things they do, nothing to be worried about. He probably is building bubble nests like hamsterlver6215 said.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|cUx1uCBkaa	Its called a bubble nest> It is a sign that he is happy(you must be a good betta owner). It could also mean that if you wanted to attempt breeding you could(just read up first).|`|Rfj2ULibaa	He's healthy and happy.  He's building bubble nests...|`|JQdkDQkWaa	I got a beta too, (he died) But he started making bubbles also. But this was after I got him a girlfriend who he murdered. So I'm not quite sure what this means. Although i bet if you google it it'll show you. Or go to Petsmart and ask them :)|`|0U2qK5Hjaa	I have owned a betta fish in the past and this is  common. Like whales, fish have to come to the top of the bowl for air. I think what you are seeing your fish do is get air. :)|`|1kQXnDmUaa	this is just scum and stuff from the tank. the bubbles form in the water all the time and it is very normal. just clean the tank about once a week and it wont be as bad.|`|5vaFaQoMaa	Bubbles mean he is content! keep doing what you are doing as he must be happy.
IrdZKYT3aa	Well, he's new, and moving can be very stressful on the poor little guys.  I'm also willing to bet he's cold.  Betta's are a tropical fish, and while they can TOLERATE being cold, they don't WANT to be cold, and just like us being too cold for too long can lead to a whole host of health issues.  They tend to become some what dormant when cold, moving less, resting more and losing their appetite.  Most pet stores, including petsmart, will sell a small heating pad that can be placed under the gravel or stuck to the wall.  I use one for two of my boys, it's a small pad that costs about 14 bucks.  I believe the company was Hydor : )<br>  Give him a few days and keep him warm and he'll soon perk up and get used to his new home.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Your betta will not very active as the water is probably a tad too cold for him. The pellets might be too large also. He'll take them in and spit them out until they break up. I always crumble any flakes and use the very small betta pellets for mine. Plus he hasn't had time to adjust. That can take up to a week or more.|`|cUx1uCBkaa	He will just take time to get used to being in a new home
6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Have you changed anything in his new home would be my first thought? Has anyone else been around him that could have really scared him? Is he shedding? I know mine can be real bears when they are shedding.  Just keep working with him, approaching him from the front and not from over top of him. Over top of him, he thinks you are a predator. Take it slow because for some reason you have to regain his trust.
GVR9AjoQaa	Think about it........ your horse is feeling just like you would if you were separated from your brother & sister!<br>  <br>  You might want to make arraingments with the people you are boarding with and you be the person feeding,grooming & mucking- reprove to him that you're still his best friend!<br>  <br>  You mention you bring your other horse- when you leave you're leaving & taking his stable-mate with you!!!  He's probably sad & jealous!  Makes him feel unloved.|`|ijLewIjnaa	Aww, there could be many reasons for his behavior.  First, you might want to put yourself in his position.  I do not mean to sound cheesy, but you had been a really close companion to him and you two spent a lot of time together.  Then, due to reasons (he would not know), he was left to live with another family.  He has also probably adapted to his new home and become close with his "new owners."  If you really do want to reestablish the close companionship you once had with your horse, the only solution I see is to make frequent visits.  I hope this helped (:
B6zl0AJDaa	First of all, I take it you don't know what size tree you currently have.  Generally a mutton withered horse uses a WIDE to EXTRA WIDE tree.  <br>  <br>  The easiest thing for you to do is take a wire coat hanger and undo it, then use the wire to shape it across your horse's withers and take that with you shopping.<br>  <br>  I've got an old Stubben Siegfried that's seemed to fit everything from my very first TB all the way to my mutton withered Azteca.  It's on a WIDE tree and I've ALWAYS used the breastplate that I got with it over 37 years ago.<br>  <br>  You may want to take a look at Stubbens...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stubbennorthamerica.com/stuSaddles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stubbennorthamerica.com/stuSa...</a>|`|iiNAJfGCaa	If the saddle only slips when you mount from the ground, then I would suggest getting on from a mounting block. It's better for your horse's back anyways.|`|oArW3lbJaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  I would advise you to look at our product for this problem,  it is called the betterfit custom contouring saddle pad, and we have developed a pad to be used with english saddles that fits in the pad underneath the saddle.  look at website www.fourquartercircle.com and click on betterfit saddle pad.  please let me know what you think?|`|NevKx5fzaa	I have the same problem! I use a 'No Slip Pad" it goes under the saddle pad. yes mounting from the ground is bad for your horses back but only in the long term.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	Rosie is right! : )<br>  <br>  My Paso Fino, including most paso finos, tend to have short withers and use a wide gullet.  I would first measure him and then find a saddle to match that size.  A tack fitter can also help too.  Wintec and another saddle brand have saddles where you can change out the gullets too, saving lots of money if you horses changes size or you ride multiple horses.  What brand of saddle do you use?<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a video on how to make a saddle fitting template, you can then take this template when you go shopping to find the right gullet size.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.horse.com/horsemanship-training-library.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.horse.com/horsemanship-traini...</a><br>  Steps:<br>  Click on "Tack and Equipment" then click "Saddle fit template"<br>  There are four videos to show you what to do.|`|QPMaoaSIaa	I would say his conformation has caused the saddle to not fit him properly. <br>  1. Is it fine when you ride him?<br>  2. Does the saddle move when you do rising trot?<br>  3. Have you tried jumping in the saddle? Does it move then?<br>  <br>  If you've tightened the girth to the right level (fit one palm underneath it) and it is placed correctly and still moves, it may need a smaller gullet. If you're saddle doesn't have an interchangable gullet system you might have to buy a new saddle which does and have a smaller gullet. However if the saddle only moves whilst mounting (not when riding) and causes your horse no pain, then you could keep it and just simply get someone to put their hand in the other stirrup whilst mounting to stop it from slipping.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your riding.<br>  <br>  Further info-<br>  Ask your local saddlery about its return policy. Purchase the saddle you think will fit (take a rough measurement with you to the store), try out the saddle and if you like it, keep it. If not return it.<br>  If you're prepared to spend more money, get a professional to come out and fit your saddle.<br>  Ask your local trainer, instructor or people at the saddlery for more advice :)|`|m1cAyExiaa	tightning the girth alwayysss works(;<br>  i used to have the same prob!
YR9l82vmaa	she looks like she has a bit of AmStaff in her...|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Sometimes you aren't able to start guessing what they are mixed with until they are a little older.  I see some Pointer in her as well as maybe Terrier or something.  Its really so hard to say.  If both her parents were mutts, and both their parents were mutts..... you get the point.  She could quite literally be a 'Heinz 57'.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Not really sure. But it could be scottish collie, border collie or german sheperd. You can ask breeders or rescues for their opinion|`|mc59Y5vwaa	Is her tail docked or naturally that short?  If its naturally there are not many dogs with naturally short tails--aussies, corgies, oes...(none of which she looks particularly like...maybe an aussie).|`|nfwoTiz4aa	to be a 100% sure you should take her to your local veterinarian or animal shelter problem solved and they can answer the rest of your questions too|`|ZzbuuHsDaa	umm looks like a lab. maybe a bit of waterdog or terrier.|`|6FtqLQm7aa	Maybe she is a mix with a German Shepard?

It looks nothing like a pom or shih tzu.|`|6FtqLQm7aa	It looks like it could be a Maltese puppy. It is very cute!

Jkt3UkTBaa	Here is a sponge filter, it is quite powerful but it will show you what they look like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aquacave.com/hydro-sponge-filters-10.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquacave.com/hydro-sponge-fil...</a><br>  <br>  How they work: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqKImgnB41M" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqKImgnB4...</a>|`|SZOMVGBRaa	It just sits there, the water doesn't really move, you hook and Air pump into the middle of it and it makes bubbles come out that create a slight water flow. They are great because they harbor HUGE amounts beneficial bacteria.  Here's a link to buy them online, Most real pet stores or fish specialty shops will have them. Your not gonna find them in petsmarts and petcos and stuff like that. You will still need to gravel vacuum obvously but they are better than power filters for tanks that small. Good Luck<br>  <br>  Edit to the people that answered before me: Sponge filters are not out dated, they are used by ever single home breeder of fish you fools. They are not used by noobs in the hobby which is why you think they are out dated. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jehmco.com/html/hydro-sponge_filters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jehmco.com/html/hydro-sponge_...</a>|`|nTnS6YS8aa	a sponge filter is great for with holding beneficial bacteria, but you would be best with a sponge filter and a bio filter with carbon in it, the air goes down a tube into the sponge and the bubbles rise and cause a displacement, the water rushes to fill that area and since the air is going up so does that water, and it sucks stuff into the sponge, the water just rises then falls. you can get them at any pet store|`|bD7Yaatkaa	A filter is a must, but TopFin is a pretty reasonable company, you don't really need something too fancy. Sounds like you have a ten gallon, but I'm not 100% on that.<br>  Here's were you have a choice, to get a heater or not. ALL TROPICAL FISH NEED A HEATER. With no heater I recomend a school of white cloud mountain minnow. They need to be in a group, but don't need to be heated, they prefer cooler waters. They're very striking, especially the longer finned variety. I'd avoid goldfish as they are extremlly messy and you'll need excellent increased filtration to keep even one alone in the tank. They need a lot of filtration and a lot of space.<br>  With a heater, about 15 bucks for a ten gallon heater, you've got a lot more options.<br>  I'd suggest fake plants, easir to keep and you won't need special lighting.<br>  As for placing avoid direct sun light. And make sure whatever surface you use can support the ful weight of the aquarium.<br>  As for lighting, with just fish a simple light is fine, plants need a better lighting system.<br>  With pretty much all tropical fish tropical flakes are fine. The minnow will eat these fine as well.<br>  Best of Luck!|`|f8RBtCVAaa	well they are a tad hard to fine because they are kinda old and not popular no more. petco or pets mart may have some.
Wn3LGHTvaa	Lots of luck. Turtles are impossible to keep clean. You might have an easier job if you:<br>  1) Keep a bare tank; no sand; no rocks.<br>  2) Use a filter rated for a tank twice the size of the one you have.<br>  3) Add some snails to the tank.<br>  4) Feed the turtles in a different container.|`|LYnK4xb0aa	the tank is getting too much light
zituIhQ2aa	both nice breeds... what draws you to these breeds? Do your research and make sure you are making the right decision...large breeds come with large responsibilities|`|pc7ZjexJaa	:-)<br>  <br>  of course I am going to say great dane<br>  <br>  although I *love* berners.<br>  <br>  if I could-I would own them. but...my dad doesn't like the fact that they die *so* young (younger than danes!) and the breed has a huge issue with cancer<br>  <br>  the berners I know are great dogs.<br>  but I still love danes more|`|gjD8pndjaa	Tell us a bit about what your lifestyle would be like for the dog?<br>  <br>  From my experiences with both breeds, Berners tend to be slightly more people-oriented to the Danes slightly more independent nature.  But each invidivduals temperament can be drastically different<br>  <br>  One thing to keep in mind is that both breeds on the average have very unfortuantely short life spans (Berners, too, have some of the highest cancer rates of any dog breed)|`|26PPwzrWaa	For cuddling, what fur issues do you have? Surely you will have tons of fur if you go for a bernese. I love both breeds, research which ones personality fits you the best.

If they don't make eye contact a lot, then she should calm down. Also, if the cat is young (under 8 months old) and she scratches and bites your roommates, they can pick her up by the scruff of the neck and tell her 'no' quite firmly so she learns that that sort of behavior is wrong. <br>  <br>  Hope that works :]|`|srjPOxW7aa	just like people a cat doesn't have to like everyone, if she has a particular liking to you, that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?

F3FrZ7eAaa	I would much rather use a free piece of drift wood than paying money for a stick! What you need to do it thoroughly clean it though. Disinfect it completely as you don't want to transfer any mites or ticks.<br>  <br>  How to disinfect?<br>  <br>  There are a bunch of different ways. Freezing the log for a couple days will kill most things but not all eggs are killed this way.  You can soak it in a 5% bleach solution for 24 hours and then let air dry. Better yet is to let dry in the sun, if possible. Dense wood doesn't take that long to get the bleach out. Another way is baking it. Just stick it in the oven at 350 for about 20-25 min.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	As long as you disinfect it first. If not you run the risk of infecting your gecko with mites and other yucky bugs. You can try freezing it, soaking it in bleach water ( a cap full of bleach for a sink full of water) and rinse thoroughly. Some people disinfect by using ovens, but I wouldn't try it with wood lol.|`|OHfcGAgIaa	buy one from the pet store = a lot less hassle and you know it won't casue problems for your gecko.|`|01nMRPHVaa	Yes you could. Just heat them to 300 degrees and make sure there clean!|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	Marco's answer was exactly right. I bake all of mine but wash them first in boiling water.

I agree with the person that getting a puppy right now might not be a good idea.  Puppies are really demanding and with you just starting college it might be too much stress on you.  If your an animal person and have to have a pet to feel ok (i'm the same way).  I would suggest you adopt a cat right now until your lifestyle develops a little more.  When you start to move more into a pattern then get a puppy.  If your not much of a cat person then maybe something else than doesn't require so much attention and training.  You didn't really give enough information for me to recommend a specific breed, but I would definitely not recommend one that is high energy or high maintenance.  Maybe a chihuahua or a bulldog like someone mentioned earlier.  No hounds like a weenie dog because they tend to be a little suborned and take a lot of patience and time in training.  Good luck in your search.  Also you could go to your local SPCA and they would be able to help you search for the right dog for your lifestyle too.  They have some wonderful dogs that are already trained and maybe a little older that don't need as much time as a puppy would.

I tried that site they recommend above and it was really interesting and helpful.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Talk with the apartment manager, some places have size limits on the pets they allow. If you're going to be as busy as you say, you should put off getting a dog for a while unless you have someone to let it out and take it for walks. Dogs take a lot of time and effort in training. If left alone for long periods of time they can become destructive and aggressive. You can go to <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com</a>  and research several breeds of dogs to see which is most suitable for you. But with the combination of apartment living, classes, homework, etc. I do not see that many dogs you'd be able to properly care for. I am not saying that you wouldn't try, but that it would be unfair to the dog. But if you are insistent, do your research and check out local animal shelters and rescues.|`|EIxu1Gtraa	you should get a small breed because of your apartment status...<br>  maybe a Yorkie Terrier or a West Highland Terrier... both have great temperments and both can be left alone somtimes....<br>  <br>  Since you are going to college you might actually want to still save up for a puppy and wait till after college to get one since most of your time will be in your classes and studing =]|`|4rWUv12Maa	Affenpinscher <br>  American Bullnese<br>  American Hairless Terrier<br>  American Lo-Sze Pugg (TM)<br>  Australian Terrier<br>  Basset Hound<br>  Bichon Frise<br>  Bichon/Yorkie<br>  Biewer<br>  Bolognese<br>  Boston Terrier<br>  Brussels Griffon<br>  Bulldog<br>  Cavachon<br>  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel<br>  Cesky Terrier<br>  Chacy Ranior<br>  Chi-Poo<br>  Chihuahua<br>  Chinese Crested (hairless)<br>  Cockapoo<br>  Corgi<br>  Coton De Tulear<br>  Dandie Dinmont Terrier<br>  Dachshund<br>  English Toy Spaniel<br>  French Bulldog<br>  German Spitz<br>  Glen of Imaal Terrier<br>  Griffon Bruxellois<br>  Hairless Khala<br>  Havanese<br>  Italian Greyhound<br>  Japanese Spaniel (Chin)<br>  Kerry Blue Terrier<br>  Kyi-Leo?<br>  Lagotto Romagnolo<br>  Lakeland Terrier<br>  Lancashire Heeler<br>  Lhasa Apso<br>  Lowchen  (Little Lion Dog)<br>  Maltese<br>  Malti-Poo<br>  Manchester Terrier<br>  Mi-Ki<br>  Miniature English Bulldog<br>  Miniature Fox Terrier<br>  Miniature Pinscher<br>  Miniature Poodle<br>  Miniature Schnauzer<br>  Olde Victorian Bulldogge<br>  Ori Pei<br>  Papillon<br>  Pekepoo<br>  Pekingese<br>  Peruvian Inca Orchid<br>  Pocket Beagle <br>  Pomeranian<br>  Prazsky Krysavik<br>  Pug<br>  Queen Elizabeth Pocket Beagle<br>  Russian Toy Terrier<br>  Schipperke<br>  Schnoodle<br>  Scottish Terrier (Scottie)<br>  Sealyham Terrier<br>  Shichon<br>  Shih-Tzu<br>  Silky Terrier<br>  Skye Terrier<br>  Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier<br>  Standard Schnauzer<br>  Tibetan Spaniel<br>  Toy Poodle<br>  Victorian Bulldog<br>  West Highland White Terrier<br>  Yorkshire Terrier<br>   <br>  i hope you get it from the pound!|`|TPWs85H1aa	I recomend not getting a bull anything, most of those are baned in apartments. you need a low energy dog that will complement your lifestyle.

bIf6pvxuaa	It's in LOVE with you, sir!!! <3|`|7HEZhx46aa	1. It could mean he/she is about to poop. If he/she is rubbing on you when he/she does it, he/she's "in love" with your hand (or whatever he/she's rubbing on). LOTs of birds do this, both male and female.<br>  2. He or she is trying to regurgitate for you -- which is another really good sign of affection. My caiques do it (and so far they haven't given me any "presents"). Don't be surprised if you actually get a little "gift" once in a while.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	She's just content. These seem like signs of a happy lovebird. I had two peach faced lovebirds that would do the same thing and "dance" back and forth on their perches if a radio was turned on. It's just their way of goofing off and showing they're happy.|`|b1xnoBSiaa	Tail-wagging is very common as a sign of happiness and often that she is glad to see you! <br>    ALL of our birds do this from time to time, especially if we've been gone for the day.<br>  <br>  Nodding is just being funny, like dancing or being silly. She's playing a game, getting your attention and being a sweetheart!
nrPy4vwRaa	Sounds like calcium and or UV deficiency which means his bones are literally turning soft.

Dogs have a lot of skin & itch problems! And, they will scratch and chew themselves bloody raw trying to get relief.|`|19QSiNqgaa	its an itch problem, he either has a skin condition or really bad fleas, bathing the area with apple cider vinegar can relieve the itch for him temporarily.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Your dog may have skin allergies. See what the Vet says.  ^-^|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	I am glad you are going to the vet. The black scab on the tip of the ear is from a break in the skin there.  He may have an ear infection or be allergic to something. Dogs that are uncomfortable or ill develop neurotic licking which can make open sores.  Only through proper testing will you find <br>  what is causing his problem.  Dogs need lots of exercise <br>  all the time.  When they don't get enough exercise they will get neurotic.|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	well sense its winter, the inside probably has lots of heater, with no moisture in the air, that means his skin is dry so moisturizing shampoo, and he should be fine, <br>  my dog itches from dry skin, cuz her shampoo sux, i keep telling my dad to get better shampoo, but he never does<br>  im gonna think of a plan to get him to buy this shampoo|`|8MTN47C9aa	He may have fleas or it may be a nervous habit. Have you added any new pets to your family? My cat does the same thing and the vet said it was his thyroid that was causing his skin to become itchy and irritated. Good Luck! :)|`|kzLJbZMBaa	sounds like fleas.|`|LURQBU86aa	He is most likely suffering from allergies. Dogs with allergies will scratch, chew and lick areas on their bodies that are itchy to them. It would make sense that it's allergies because the weather is starting to get nice again and flowers/trees are starting to bloom. There are allergy tests that can be performed but there are a tad bit expensive. Allergies in dogs are a very common thing.|`|AA11627842	It could just be fleas or are you bathing him alot ? Are you useing something different at all to bath him thats not meant for dogs? His skin can only take some many baths. That combined with fleas can  make his skin very dry and irritable.Then he can get a skin infection. it would feel like you getting a bad case of posion ivy. It happened to a dog i had. My ex wife did not like the way he smelled and bathed him alot. All the baths  made him miserable and cost me $150 at the vet. The vet gave him a shot for the itching.An anibiotic and of course flea meds. The poor guy chewed on his belly until he whined and it bled. Then of course the vet instructed my ex not the bath him so often.She would not listen to me .|`|fX6ENI8Zaa	Its good you're taking him to the vet, sounds like he definitely needs some sort of diagnoses.<br>  You might find, he has eczema or some sort of dermatitis...or skin condition. Or he may have an obsessive personality which means he focuses on those two spots to nibble or bite and its some sort of weird comfort to him.<br>  Either way...good luck!|`|5a1c8253181a8adf5c06c0040d8f981eaa	You should have your dog examined by a veterinarian.  Whatever is wrong we cannot diagnose over YA.  If you are going to see the vet tomorrow, don't bathe your dog.  They will want to see the skin "as is."|`|xWXCbRXkaa	You should deffinatly take him to the vet.<br>  It sounds like your dog either has fleas or some infected bite.<br>  If it's fleas, buy and use Frontline.|`|yIm2tWryaa	allergies, fleas or mites<br>  <br>  only the vet can really help<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|2LmfQUbKaa	it could be dry skin but ya take him in you never know what it could be good luck to you!|`|3eSzjwEhaa	my dog has some skin allergies but they have stopped for a long time now, he used to make himself bleed a little they tend to nibble they specially nibble close to their private parts try to go to petsmart and get a shampoo that is natural and it is made of oatmeal it is really good for their skin and i think it helps with dog allergies on their skin too the bottle has a world in the middle and it is white its kind of expensive less than 20 but its worth it. go to the vet also|`|Ap4aUgiZaa	well, my grandmas dog did the same thing. i know it seems like there not scracthing themselves but they really are.<br>  they nible with there teeth when its a really bad itch instead of with there paws. you should take your dog to the vet because they might have a skin problem or flees. i really hope you dog gets better.|`|dOkUekW6aa	my rottweiler chews on her right front paw until it is raw. i took her to a vet to see if there may have been something in it. there was not. He advised me that dogs like people can have nervous habits. this being similar to a person picking their nails, or a scab. This may not be your dog's problem , but it is an answer that  a vet gave me .|`|gfhp1Ctnaa	its probably something thats bothering him that makes him want to bite it. just like we really want to scratch an ant bite whenever we get one:) lol<br>  yea the vet sounds like a good idea:)

No matter what go to the nearest exotic pet vet and get them a health check, the vet should also be able to tell you what the baby is.|`|P8hOtEdOaa	That is a baby kangaroo (joey) or wallaby.

xv63biFiaa	Ha, this is funny cause i have the EXACT same problem.  I am 13 btw.  My mom hates dogs too, and a while back I was trying to convince her to let me have a small indoor dog.  When she would say no, I would ask her nicely what the reasons were, and she would tell me, "I don't want dog hair and poop all over the house" or something like that.  ...To the internet I went... I would look up dogs that don't shed, which is this one type of morkie that didn't shed.  Then I asked my bff if she feeds her chiuahua special food to make it's poop hard to it's not a mess to clean up, and she said yea but it only costs a dollar more.  So I went and told my mom that, and explained to her how I promise to take care of it and she should give me a chance at least.  I even told her I could wait until summer so I could have time to pody train it before school starts, and guess what? After months of pestering her she gave in.  I now have the CUTEST little morkie ever. I hope this strategy works for your friend cause I know EXACTLY how she feels. Tell her good luck :)|`|PM23RDycaa	Its not YOUR responsibility or place to help her take care of a dog. Her mother doesn't like dogs so guess what she won't be getting? A dog that's right. Both YOU and your friend need to respect the fact that her mother does NOT like dogs. She doesn't want a dog she doesn't want the responsibility of a dog.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	Your friend's mom hates dogs. That should be an immediate red flag. I would never have a dog live in a home where he or she is not wanted by anyone but, obviously, the person who asked for it. Also, she's the one who has the authority over who lives under the roof, not her 11 year old daughter.

I took her to PetSmart and had to carry her around to protect her.<br>  Anyways, even if a dog has already had vaccinations, but you're not sure, get the dog vaccinated. It's not good to have double vaccinations, but its SOOO much better than the alternative.<br>  Also, make sure they give the dog the vaccination for kennel cough (it goes in the nose) in case he/she ever gets lost and has to go to the pound.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	OMG .. is that actually a myth that's out there??<br>  <br>  The dog will not die.

b015RuNFaa	My guess would be mostly genetics, environment, and poor diet.  And sometimes it's just the (bad) luck of the draw.  There's just a lot of toxic stuff out there that doesn't seem particularly bad on the surface, but over time it builds up and leads to cancer and other diseases.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Mia inbreeding doesn't happen in every dog or breed of dog. Human cancers are on the rise too, so are we Inbred too? However the likely hood of getting cancer can be genetic, and breed specific. We are being exposed to more and more toxins every day and un beknownst to a lot of us, cancer cells are in us all at all times. It just depends what will trigger then to go haywire. So just coming into contact with something harmful can trigger the cells into attacking themselves. It will only get worse before it gets better.|`|d2b13247b0a080e166b6ef614a4f6a7daa	This is only my theory mind you. What one thing do all pets and zoo animals do every day for their entire lives?

But I give my pets filtered water, and have for years now.|`|tB7QK6BTaa	Why do so many people die from Cancer?<br>  <br>  A person who can answer that question definitively will be well on the way to a 'Cure for Cancer', and subsequent Nobel Prize.|`|RSJTy4cdaa	Because so many owners blindly follow the advertisements and feed Purina, Beneful, Puppy Chow, Pedigree.|`|uKW6HUSOaa	Well...I guess the same reason why millions of people around the world also die of cancer.|`|LYnK4xb0aa	they are exposed to the same things we are but they age faster,,at 10 they are 70|`|Wt61EclRaa	Heredity,  a lot of dogs are living much longer now then they did years ago-like people.  I believe diet has a lot to do with it.  So sad..Just today I heard of 2 dogs that were put down for Lymphoma.  In the same conversation a husband and wife that died from cancer within months of each other...in their early 50's.  sucks. I guess the environment could have something to do with it too. I'm sorry for both of your losses.|`|XQAT64toaa	most of the time it is due to overbreeding. different breeds become more susceptible to different diseases when they are overbred. for example, bull mastiffs tend to suffer hip displaisia. i'm sorry to hear about the loss of your dogs, but it does happen often.|`|SfTWwm97aa	I know it is so sad. I think they are just prone like humans are because we are all prone to a lot of crap. But I bet other animals are just  as prone as dogs, but we may not notice since dogs are the most domesticated animal on earth, and we all grow so close to our pups.|`|3fur16Rgaa	Inbreeding can cause tons of defects and also causes certain species to be prone to a disease that is bred into them and some parts of an immune system is weakened through inbreeding.
m16dhfrGaa	One of you is going to be the alpha dog.  It won't be your old Corgi so I suggest it's you.  Show disapproval when this behavior is exhibited.  You can do a low growl, or say No in a really low voice.  The alhpa dog just has to give a low warning growl in a dog pack, but if you have watched dogs behavior you will see the surprise reprimand, so if your No or growl is ignored you can leap up and grab the new dog and yell, "I told you not to do that." And push him away from the old dog firmly, even roughly, but not hurting him.  I would reassure the older dog by voice but not make a big fuss at the time, because you don't want to cause jealousy.  Give it a few days and see if they settle down.<br>  <br>  Edit:  If I have a misbehaving dog around I roll up a newspaper and put some tape round it.  Use it to smack the floor or a piece of furniture.  Don't hit the dog with it.   After you hit the floor  with this a few times you'll probably just have to raise it in the air and that little ratbag will fall in line.|`|SkgJYDaCaa	i think the new dog is trying to establish dominance over your corgi. the best thing to do is to correct the behavior by showing your new dog that you are the leader. i would give it longer than a week. your corgi and new dog need time to adjust to each other. is he being aggressive when he nips her or is he trying to play? there is a huge difference in the two. i suggest taking them for walks together and taking them to a small dogs dog park in your town (if you have one) good luck :)|`|fgxajTiBaa	Did the HS not do a dog intro? Call them tomorrow and talk to them about the situation that's occuring. More than likely it'll work itself out once they establish their individual ranks. Your new dog is probably trying to be a higher rank than the other dog.<br>  <br>  If you do have to rehome her, make sure you bring her back to the HS, they usually have a clause in the adoption contract that states you have to bring them back to them if you can no longer keep the dog.|`|QQqhzuNDaa	Alpha attitude is hard to change. You love your corgi, and she loves you, and owe her a peaceful last few years of life.
4e5c321b3099a1f6ff699e8cd693bc94aa	Of course you should or take the unruly beast for some behavior training. Some people (like me ) are afraid of dogs and that could turn into a bad situation.|`|0nIwKd5Uaa	Yes because if you invite someone into your home and they get hurt you are liable for any damages done. And your dog can get in trouble as well.<br>  <br>  It's the owners responsibility to keep guests safe from their pets.|`|6qsocyK3aa	Of course, why on earth did you need to ask that?|`|F5vsY4rOaa	Unless you want someone bit and a complaint against it that can lead to him being put down|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Yes removed and disciplined.|`|1OnUfhifaa	yup.....straight away|`|JM3ef0d1aa	Yes! Otherwise, you are telling your dog that bad behavior is appropriate and you're trying to teach him not to do that (I hope)

sYjt4xQFaa	it probably won't make a huge difference. when you apply it, you are applying it directly to their skin in between their shoulder blades, not on their hair. so once it starts absorbing in the skin, its not going to rub off as easy. but i would wait until the morning or whenever they wont be in bed for a while, because that stuff can be pretty smelly on your sheets!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I would wait till it dries.|`|hfZSILMNaa	yes, leave it untill the morning, as it does need to dry before going in a small confined space, but im not sure how the dogs sleep, if its a lrgearea then this is fine, but @ least if you leave it untill the morning you will have peace of mind
eDySIDPQaa	It does work the garlic stays in the dogs system, fleas and ticks do not tolerate garlic at all.......that's why you will see no fleas or ticks on dogs that on are Brewers Yeast with Garlic,and the tablets are better, as some dogs will take it in powder form.<br>  <br>  In the long run, yes it does work, this is all I have used on all of my dogs for the past 11-12 years, no health issues with it and side effects due to pesticides or chemicals from flea treatments.....<br>  <br>  Long run, it does repel and will work as long as you keep your dog on their daily doses...I give the dose in half in am and half in pm, you give according to the weight size of the dog and it will tell you on the bottle how to give and how many.....<br>  <br>  The dogs take them right down, over the years never had one dog that refused to take them......they do work and no chemicals to worry about.<br>  <br>  I know lots of dog owners that use them, I mean more than a few but lots......and it all works for them as well......and no side effects at all.<br>  <br>  It is my preference and people galore are starting to use them as well, not just a few.....due to dogs having allergic reactions to the flea controls on the market now, like frontline, advantix, advantage, chemicals.....<br>  <br>  But, again they do work for dogs everywhere, I prefer not to give to dogs, I never have, have seen too many dogs with hair loss, allergies, skin reactions so bad, poor babies.....<br>  <br>  But, like anything, they can be allergic to anything....and like anything else, before starting dogs on anything new, consult your vet.<br>  <br>  this is an opinion, and  not meant to be medical forum solution to flea and tick control....but is my opinion, that it works better than chemicals...<br>  <br>  good luck|`|p7swtBYzaa	It doesn't.  Natural has been used for centuries and dogs have had fleas for centuries.<br>  All the dips, baths, powders, collars in the world only take care of a few adult fleas, eggs and larvae hatch and fleas come right back.<br>  <br>  The ONLY things that work and are worth using are monthly topical liquids like Advantage of Frontline - every single month.  Don't use the cheap crap like bio-spot, those chemicals harm your dog and don't work anyway.<br>  <br>  Frontline Plus or Advantix prevents fleas and ticks, put one or the other on your dog every single month.<br>  <br>  Garlic and onions cause blood disorders in dogs and brewers yeast is useless - old wives tales both.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Ive tried them all, and none of them worked for me.<br>  Beneficial nematodes do work on fleas in the yard.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It doesn't.

I have friends that use it and think it works great, but I don't honestly know how well it works. <br>  <br>  I don't use any flea product on my dog, I don't like the idea of putting pesticide on him, and since I'm not sure how well the garlic works, I don't see the point of using it. I haven't had any fleas thus far and I've had him close to a year. But I think I live in an area where fleas are less prone to being.
c94edb500cc7fe12b1da30dfd93db57caa	It means that the horse is injured, or 'not sound'.  Being lame, (or 'lameness') can be vary from minor to major, and depending on the reason it could mean that you just can't ride/work your horse for a few days, or they may be crippled for life.<br>  <br>  Common causes include things that affect the feet like thrush or founder... but it can also be as simple as a bruise on the bottom of the foot.<br>  <br>  Either way, lameness in any feet should be taken seriously as horse's hoofs are quite sensitive and need to be taken care of.  A horse's feet/hoofs are one of their most critical and important aspects to take care of.|`|31Y7QUmkaa	it can't walk b/c something happened to its leg or hoof. like if it has thrush or another hoof infection. if a horse has an infection then the vet should see it to get proper attention to it.|`|m9ay1tsEaa	not physically right. or if referred to jumping, it means the horse can't jump that high|`|YvjPePdIaa	cripled, handicapped, somehow misfunctional physically|`|88FhtX6Xaa	When a horse is lame, it means that one of their feet is injured or hurting in some way. If it is only a little lame they may not show any signs of weakness, but in worst-case scenarios they may not be able to step on it at all.|`|Bda3CPhjaa	It's like us when we pull a muscle really badly, like the horse cannot be ridden for a period of time until it is better.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	Lame is just a general term meaning that there is something "off" or wrong with the horse's leg or hoof. That it's not moving as it normally would. It could be something as slight as taking a short stride with one leg or as bad as actually hopping on the other three.|`|xLNzdxsOaa	Lame means that their a leg or foot is injured, it may or may not be permanent.

a53golMMaa	This could be a problem of insecurity. Your horse may be feeling anxious about the new trailor.<br>  <br>  Have you been driving rough? (had to stop suddenly, very sharp turns, driving on hills, excellerating fast?) all can play a factor.<br>  <br>  How have lessons been going? Would you dread lessons if you were your horse?<br>  <br>  Could your horse be suffering from pain, in any place at all? If this persists, it may be wise to have a vet look at your horse to rule out pain. In the mean time, try feeding your horse in your new trailor to get him used to being in there.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Can you feel him moving a lot in the new trailer? Sometimes horses actually prefer smaller trailers because they are more or less pinned in. If he has started to feel unbalanced when he is being trailered then this could explain his sudden change in attitude. My TB was a dream to trailer until he slipped one day. He is better now, but for the first few months after that he was an absolute nightmare to get off and on.|`|XL62syrCaa	Did you get a new trailer right before this started happening (aka didn't do it when you had the old trailer, did it as soon as you got the new one)? <br>  <br>  It maybe that he is uncomfortable in this new trailer. Some horses are comfortable in smaller trailers as they feel secure. He sounds really nervous.... <br>  <br>  Maybe work with your trainer on making him feel more comfortable in that trailer. He'll get used to it eventually.

yv91Wl3Zaa	Ariat does make a quality boot, however, those boots that you are interested in are Winter boots, meaning you will not be comfortable in them unless it is below 40 degrees. So they are not a good buy because of that. Try and see if they have any boots in the show line, like the Challenge or any other boot that isn't insulated.|`|x787hJbBaa	They don't seem bad, but personally, I would get a new pair from a saddlery because you can't exactly trust ebay to be the best source.|`|CoAc5hS9aa	As the other answerer's said, these are winter riding boots. It would be a waste unless you live somewhere where it is cold all year around.|`|eOe0uGVzaa	i wouldnt say so, because of one main reason. they're field boots. for hunter or jumper you will need dress boots|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	They're Ariat, so you know they going to be good quality. But since it's Ebay, make sure that you buy from a powerseller or someone with only good reviews. Also, if you could try the boots on at a tack shop to be sure they fit, as Ariats different models fit differently. <br>  <br>  Another thing, these boots are insulated, so they will most likely be too hot for summer riding. So maybe see if Ebay has another model of boots in your size?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Those are boots intended for winter riding, not for showing.

ec1d80b5105e09c381fb6e0b627016c2aa	grids or gynastics are fun...... trotting poles into an x, 1 stride to a verticle, 2 strides to a slightly higher verticle, 3 strides to a small oxer.  You can also reverse and go 3 strides down to the in n out.  Try some X bounce fences  Your horse should land and immediatly spring back up with no strides.  U ride it like an in n out just without the stride in the middle.  I think u want the fences 12 foot apart.  As 12 is one stride (any time ur pacing out lines, and u allow 6 ft for landing and 6 ft for takoff).  As for keeping ur horse going after fences just start riding some five or six stride lines 70 ft for a five stide between the fences.  Just concentrate on riding fwd and keeping ur horse with or in front of ur leg aids.<br>  <br>  Ur fence height can be whatever u and ur horse is used to jumping or will be jumping at the show.  Trust ur trainer/instrutor, she/he sounds like they are preparing u well.|`|ZRv94Pdtaa	You ride it.|`|88FhtX6Xaa	You should try a gymnastic line. <br>  That's where you have 3 trot poles to an X, and after doing that once or twice you add another jump one stride away, and then you keep adding one jump each time you have done the line. Once you have three or four jumps you could start doing bounces, which is a small X or a cavaletti right in the middle in between two jumps that are one stride apart. <br>  Bounce fences are a good exercise to teach your horse to pick its legs up and really use its front end more, and if he tried to stop after a jump there likely wouldn't be enough space. His only choice would be to run out, and that can be easily stopped by adding a wing on the side of the jump.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!  ;)

I have almost got her fully trained now, but I found a LIFESAVER in the meantime so my friends could walk her, and she could still have long walks when I was too tired to fight with her...It is a harness, made by HALTI (the same people who make the gentle leader) and the leash clips on to her chest (not back).  If she tries to pull it makes her front shoulders turn towards me.  It took her 30 seconds to figure this out and she hasn't pulled sincewhen it's on her!!!  <br>  <br>  For leash training, i used the choke chain, but don't pull on it.  If she starts to get ahead of you give it a swift sideways tug.  It is more like a pinch, and say HEEL!  You have to pinch it fast and hard and let go right away, because most bigger dogs will keep pulling, no matter how much they are "choking" on the chain.  Then immediately turn and go the other way.   She will follow, and just keep doing it.  It's annoying, but it totally worked for me.  Also I only give her about 3 feet of leash.  If she tries to pull, she can't cuz I am on the "pinch" right away, instead of when she gets to the end of her 6 foot leash!<br>  <br>  If she is a little smaller, my vet suggested tying the leash around your waist in the house for a while, apparently it helps her learn to follow you around.<br>  Good Luck!!|`|yXUS7jz5aa	What type of dog and how old?

zqVDJxUIaa	Bowl.<br>  There's your problem.<br>  Bowls are living hell for fish. All fish need FILTERS.  Bettas are tropical fish, and ALL tropical fish need HEATERS. Your fish will die, unless you get a tank with a filter and heater. A 5 gallon tank (about $30) would be perfect for your one female. A bowl provides no filtration whatsoever, and in a bowl, beneficial bacteria which remove poisonous chemicals (like ammonia) are not present. The waste your fish is producing will leach ammonia, and the fish is dying from ammonia poisoning. <br>  <br>  Here's how you can solve the problem.<br>  1. Get a 5 gallon tank.<br>  2. If you can't right away, immediately take steps to save the Betta:<br>  -Change 20% of the bowl's water every day (remember to condition the water with a conditioner such as Aqua Plus to remove chlorine)<br>  -use lukewarm water for every water change, because there's no heater<br>  <br>  3. Once you get the tank, cycle your tank before you put in the fish: Cycling is the building up of beneficial bacteria, for more info: <a href="http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cyclin...</a><br>  <br>  4. Use a biological supplement such as Hagen's Cycle to establish the bacteria quicker, if needed<br>  <br>  5. When the aquarium has cycled, put in the Betta.<br>  <br>  6. Meanwhile, during the cycling process, keep doing the 20% water changes, for the bowl.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	Bravo, Nate.

My husband said it would never ever clean up. But here is what I did ...and it does work. Buy 4 things (well 5 if you want to use rubber gloves) 1) The Works Toilet bowl Cleaner (it is hydrogen chloride) 2) A couple Magic Erasers 3) a razor blade <br>  4) Table salt<br>  <br>  Put the empty tank in your bath tub (get hubby to help) <br>  Squirt The works all over the inside of the tank (be real careful as it can burn your skin)<br>  Wait about 5 minutes and rinse it out..most of the deposits will be gone. <br>  Use the razor to get any spots that are left and then rinse rinse and rinse<br>  Then clean it inside and out by pouring a large amount of salt on the magic eraser and go over all the surfaces and then rinse rinse rinse (at least 5 minutes).<br>  I have done this with several tanks ..no ill effects to any fish and the results were like new beautiful tanks that most ppl would have thrown away. <br>  Hope that helps and if you have any questions you can msg me on yim im panndoria|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Hmmm, well, at work we use a solution called LemonQuat, I'm not sure were you can get this commercially but it's a great solution that's non toxic (in small doses) to the fish.  You could check our local hardware stores for it.<br>  Or try a lemon juice and vinegar solution instead, hot/warm water.  You may need to scrub it a couple times before you start to make real progress, and a lot of elbow grease will be required.<br>  Best of Luck!
