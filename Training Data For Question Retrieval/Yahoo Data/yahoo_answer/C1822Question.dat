20090219124117AAhrlBx	Computers & Internet;Software	I need to access content on my other operating system!?! HELP!?	So I had an issue with my registry on my computer.(Windows XP Home) It would only boot in safe mode. I was told that if I was to so an upgrade with Windows XP Pro that it would be fine. Instead I ended up having to make 2 separate operating systems. One with my original XP Home and this new one with XP Pro. Upon start up I get the option to choose which operating system I want to access. However whenever I choose XP Home it says some system files are missing, please reboot with the XP Home disk (or something similar to that)         How can I access my songs (media content) from my XP Home operating system. Can they still be accessed if I go to my C drive or something? And if I can get my hands on my original XP Home disk, is it possible that I can do a repair that will fix the error message I'm getting upon starting and still keep all of my info.         Sorry, I know it's long, but I really need to know. 10pts to whoever can help!

Is there any method that will let me have a reasonable number of images in the database rather than having every single (which would be millions) of all possible images. So basically I need a way of matching images even if they are not 100% the same. Hope that makes sense.

20090220074805AAw8pQC	Computers & Internet;Security	Problem downloading Kaspersky anti virus, can someone help me please?	I purchased Kaspersky anti virus 2009 from Pc World last Saturday which I put into my old tower thinking it would override my old Kaspersky, which had only 7 days left.  It detected it and aborted the download, so I un-installed my old one and tried to run Kaspersky again.  It said preparing to install then keeps asking me to restart my pc, which I did but then nothing happens.  I have been to PC World who were not very helpful and said I had to download a removal tool which I would find off the Kaspersky website under support.  I looked and there was a confusing long list of options, I have no idea of which one to choose.  I am not computer literate and would like to ask for advice as I am tearing my hair out with frustration.  On top of all that a warning sign came up on the Kaspersky trial which I am using saying a trojan with the word fraud in it had been caught and is being held in quarintine, it couldn't be deleted or disinfected because it said it couldn't be found or detected, which has got me worried.  If I uninstall Kaspersky, the trojan might escape.  And what do I choose on the long list of options.  I am stuck with no one to help me, and I need a computer for my gcse work.

20090220081604AAkwrsV	Computers & Internet;Security	I have a Trojan on my computer, how do I stop it?	BEFORE ANSWERING THIS MUST ALL BE READ!!!!   I got a Trojan on my computer on 2/19. It isn't doing anything wrong yet, but I don't want it to do anything. Please tell me step  by step where to find and delete it, or stop it from taking over my computer. I am not very computer smart, so big words and symbols I won't understand unfortunately. I don't want to download ANY anti virus things, I just want to stop this on my own. I have a 2003 Windows XP system on an Acer laptop. I got this Trojan by looking at an article about that woman who got attacked by a chimpanzee in CT. I think  as microsoft put it, it got caught "backdoor" when I left the article, and it attached to my computer. I don't want any files lost at all, it is imperative nothing gets harmed. I just need help deleting this on my own, no downloads. If it helps or not, I know that Trojans give anti virus pop-ups that only contain viruses. This pop up I am getting is XP-Police-Anti virus.      Thank you so much for the help!!

20090220092433AAkROHT	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	What happened to my PC?	Something awful has happened suddenly.      I was using my PC and it was okay. However, a few days ago, when I turned it off and turned it on again, it wouldn't start. However, the fan connected to the motherboard is still working. There is just nothing on the screen. Blank.      The irony is that when I shut it down again and sometimes switch it on, it works perfectly. But on most occasions, I get nothing on the screen.      I then tried to exchange my Windows hard disk with my Linux hard disk and boot the system again. I got the same thing - nothing, only blank screen. I then tried to use new wires. Still the same thing - nothing.      So what could be the problem? My PC is now just not working at all. The monitor is only a blank screen and the monitor led is only blinking. I didn't even get the icons and messages displayed by the motherboard when the system first boots up.      I keep both my OSs on separate hard disks and never interconnect them. I don't use partitions.

Then I installed the new card, it booted to windows using the onboard graphics. I installed all the new drivers for the card from the website. It prompted me to restart windows to finish the install. I did so, but then it wouldnt load past the windows splash screen. I have changed the bios to use the new card, but it still does not work. I dont know what else to do to get the card to work. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

20090203065008AAokRrp	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Is reddit.com quietly censoring users on its comment boards?	I've noticed that some of the messages I leave on reddit's comment boards do not appear when I'm logged out.  They only appear when I'm logged in under my username.  To everyone else, they simply aren't visible.      For instance, try opening up two browers, say Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.  In the first browser, log in as usual.  In the second browser, make sure you're logged out.  Then leave a message on a comment board that is sure to get their moderators' attention.  After a few minutes, view the same comment board in the second browser.  If you got censored, your message will still show up in the first browser, but will have disappeared in the second.      It's a covert method of censorship, probably adopted by the guys who run reddit to generate as little controversy as possible, because the people who get censored are none the wiser.  They think everyone can still read their posts, but in reality, the outside world doesn't even know they're there.  There would be a massive outcry if its userbase knew how routinely they were being censored without their knowledge.  I looked through all my previous comments and discovered that even the most innocuous messages get censored.      This has nothing to do with the number of downvotes that you get either.  Comments that get downvoted beyond the viewing threshold still appear as a single-line "collapsed comment" that you can open up by pressing the "[+]" button.      Anyone notice reddit doing this to their comments or submitted stories too?

Dim RndCard As Integer?   Boolean?   Single?   Well i'd think not integer, and its probably single...is it single? or is it one i didn't even name?

20090220115342AAVteyW	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Excel Macro for Autofill Horizontally.?	If you have a column of data (let's say A1 to A5) and you create a formula in B1linking to A1(let's say B1=A1 *2 or what ever you want) you can simply double click in the lower right corner and it will Automatically fill Cells B2 through B5.  It knows to automatically fill until there is a null cell in Column A.        Does anyone have a macro (or define a macro) that would do the same thing for a horizontal application?      For instance I have values in C1 to C120.  I would like to be able to place a formula in Cell B1 linking to C1 (let's say C1 * 2). I would then have Cell B1 active and run the macro which would automatically fill in Cell B2 to B120 (i.e. B2 = C2 *2, B3 = C3*2, etc.. ).  The macro would know when there is a null cell in row C and it doesn't need to copy further.      Thanks a ton for your help!!!
