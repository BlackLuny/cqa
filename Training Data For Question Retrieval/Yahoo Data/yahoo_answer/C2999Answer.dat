A recent NOAA study found that we've already caused some irreversible changes in the global climate for the next 1,000 years.<br>  <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2009/01/26/noaa-climate-change-irreversible-1000-years-drought-dust-bowls/" rel="nofollow">http://climateprogress.org/2009/01/26/no...</a><br>  <br>  However, what we can do is prevent global warming from causing catastrophic damage.  There's a range of possible future global warming, and the more the planet warms, the worse climate change will be.  A recent MIT study found that if we take action, we can keep global warming down to another 2-3°C, but if we take no action the planet will warm 5-7°C by the year 2100.  If the planet warms 5°C or more, there will almost certainly be catastrophic changes like major droughts, food and water shortages, and desertification which will be extremely difficult for humans to cope with.<br>  <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2009/02/23/mit-doubles-global-warming-projections/" rel="nofollow">http://climateprogress.org/2009/02/23/mi...</a><br>  <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2009/01/11/half-of-worlds-population-could-face-climate-driven-food-crisis-by-2100/" rel="nofollow">http://climateprogress.org/2009/01/11/ha...</a>|`|t1zlbOURaa	It's hard to recover from something that doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  If anything, most of the Northern Hemisphere has been complaining about cold summers and colder winters for a couple of years. <br>  <br>  Think about it... you will discover purely from rational thought, that warmer is better than colder.|`|Nf60Q6UFaa	We will not know unless we try.  Or we could just continue to relentlessly pollute the planet and think that it has no effect.  We may try and still fail, it would beat not trying to save ourselves, would it not?<br>  <br>  Gravity is a theory too, does that mean we can ignore it?|`|ARg18fPcaa	Absolutely actually right now there is a company called carbon sciences(stock symbol CABN) that turns captured CO2 into fuel.  They were in the USA today yesterday in a big article about how they are just about to build the first one this year.  I am about to invest some money in them cause they get to sell carbon credits for removing the carbon then sell the fuel to consumers.  Really cool idea|`|DDw6k8JOaa	Whether your afraid of it or not Global Warming is a natural trend. You can't stop it or prevent it. You can speed it up. But you cant stop it. <br>  <br>  So pretty much yes but we will have to change our way of life during the ice ages|`|eJgEYi8Waa	Not in our lifetimes.  The question is how bad it will be for our descendents.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	Sure. First we have tohalt it,of course.<br>  <br>  But that's going to happen eventually. The propaganda of special interests aside, clean (emission free) energy technology is inherently superior to fossil fuels. It's coming, environmental concerns or no. Wind power is already cost-effective. Solar soon will be. Electric cars use half the power--and cost half as much to run (the problem there is range--storing enough power. But that is being solved).<br>  <br>  The question is two-fold. Will we act quickly enough to haldt CO2 emissions before te  effects become so severe they create problems we can't recover from. So far that is not happening.<br>  <br>  Assuming we do halt global warming--we can also reverse it, at least partially, by reforestration. A few billion trees will extract a lot of CO2 from the atmosphere over time. <br>  <br>  We won't get CO2 levels down to what they were a century ago. But we don't really need to. But we can achieve a stable level that will prevent a mass extinction, keep climate change within tolerale bounds, and our children and grandchildren will have a future to look forward to.|`|Io0ItVDPaa	We can recover from global warming.<br>  <br>  The debate is over about global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of hundreds of scientists from 113 countries, said that based on new research over the last six years, it is 90 percent certain that human-generated greenhouse gases account for most of the global rise in temperatures over the past half-century<br>  <br>  Global warming, or climate change, is something that we can recover from. If we don't turn around our ways soon though, it may be too late. Yes, if we suddenly at this moment stopped emitting green house gasses, we still may lose some land, because there is a "lag effect" with green house gasses we emit today, and how they may affect us tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Species are going extinct, and in many areas water is becoming scarce. There are many emerging technologies that if implemented, we can avert this climate crisis. We can create a hydrogen economy, use this great fuel to power our cars, and use resources such as the wind and the sun to create clean, renewable, energy. We can use nuclear energy, and harness the power of the water with hydro-power. <br>  <br>  We can avert this crises, we just need to do what is needed. Everyone needs to do their part, nations need to collaborate, and we will pull through this.<br>  <br>  Also, if i may point out, it's very interesting that those who are calling man made global warming a "hoax" have presented no evidence, and I am sincerely disappointed in those who have said so in this question without any evidence. I welcome them to present us with evidence.|`|7IfQrwwwaa	Well, you see, there has been abrupt climate change going on for a while now. For thousands of years actually. I think the earth warming just has to do with increased population in certain areas. So please get ALL facts on global warming before you do a paper on it.|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	We have to help the earth and stop global warming. Man made global warming is real. Volcanoes cause smoke and what else does factories and those are man made! Earth can heal itself from global warming, but it is building up and is going to fast earth cant keep up.|`|RkK56aunaa	According to Al Gore (Inventor of the Internet) we are all doomed.  Fortunately for me, I neither believe in man-made "Global Warming" or in fat Al Gore.  Man-made Global Warming is a political hoax.|`|r8tpwmixaa	Sure. Defund the UN and the IPCC.<br>  AGW is the Trojan horse for global socialism.|`|uOE5vuJnaa	For your paper just write that Global Warming is fake and scientists don't realize that this is natural for the climate|`|zqS9E9Acaa	not entirely and not so promptly.<br>  over time the damage can be subsided, <br>  but we must act n ow.
0as2Vcd4aa	After reading your question, I went to my local DNR website. You'll want to check the site for whichever is your homestate. However, I did come across an article: "How to Become a Conservation Officer." I'm pretty sure the basics apply to everyone even if requirements by the states vary.|`|AA11199260	Dear Friend. You can fulfill your desire by getting job in any farm, wherever you will go as a result of your husband transfer to that place. Otherwise you will have to keep your desire as dormant. Good Luck.|`|GgTFxr0jaa	Well sounds like your first step is school.<br>  You can go to college and major in many different conservation-related majors.  (Obviously different colleges will offer different degrees.)<br>  Ones to look for:<br>  Environmental Sciences<br>  Ecology<br>  Wildlife Biology and/or Zoology<br>  Natural Resources Management<br>  Marine Biology<br>  Forestry or Botany<br>  Environmental Engineering|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	You should start off in a junior or community college..they will have more flexible class times (nights, etc.) if you need to be home in the day with your kids, or day classes to take while your kids are in school,  and it will not be a big deal to transfer from one community college to the next. A community college will be less expensive as well to allow you to take all your general ed. at a resonable price.  You should probably major in zoology, biology, wildlife management or something along those lines once you get into a university.

(or cold maybe.)  - turn your house thermostat down a bit.  - (and up in the summer.)  - close the door.  don't let heat escape.   - turn lights off when you're not using them.  - close the refrigerator and freezer doors quickly.  - keep the freezer free of frost.  - if there are rooms you don't use, close the heater vent, and close the door.    you might go around and look at the lights you normally use.  add up the watts of all the bulbs.  if you're like me, you'll be surprised at how much electricity you're using there.    the new swirly light bulbs (CF bulbs) can cut that use quite a bit, because they use about 1/4 as much power for the same amount of light.  you do have to buy them, but in Calif at least, the power company subsidizes the price.    --  is that enough to keep you busy for a while?|`|sfC6L8ybaa	Many simple steps.  These from Progressive Energy Co:  Winter:  With winter temperatures falling and heating systems running for longer periods, it's the best time to take control of your electric bills.    Keep your thermostat at the lowest comfortable setting. If you have a heat pump, adjust your thermostat in small increments to avoid the operation of the supplemental heat strip in your system. Energy consumption is much higher when the heat strip is in use. A steady setting on your heat pump thermostat produces constant comfort and minimizes the use of the less efficient resistance heat strip.   Keep the fan on your central heating unit on "auto" position. Leaving the fan on "on" can add $25 a month to your heating costs.     (Ensure the heating thermostat is on an inside wall and away from windows and doors.)      Clean or replace filters every month. Dirty filters can increase operating costs by 20 percent.      By setting your thermostat back 10 degrees at night (8-10 hours), you'll save 10 percent to 20 percent in heating costs. The lowered thermostat setting saves energy dollars by reducing the length of time the heating system operates throughout the night.    Use ceiling fans in winter to distribute heat around a room.      Close your fireplace damper when not in use. Consider glass doors to help prevent heat loss when your heating system is on.      Make sure registers are not blocked by furniture or draperies.        Use insulated or heavy curtains on windows facing the north side of the house. Keep curtains and shades closed at night or on cloudy days.      When entertaining, lower the thermostat a degree or two before the guests arrive. That way, you won't overheat.|`|pnCOR1UVaa	If you are talking about the energy you use in your home here are a few ideas. Reduce standby energy, many things especially electronics use energy even when they are turned off. Look for things that have clocks, lights, use a remote or charge. Unplug them when they are not in use. If you have a power stip with a switch laying around you can plug them into the strip then flip everything off when you are finished. Here are a list of common items that use standby energy, tv, dvd/vcr, game systems, ipod docking stations, stereos, battery chargers, electric toothbrushes , computers. If you use a desktop computer make sure all the accessories are off as well, monitor, speakers, printer etc.     When you use appliances like washer or dishwasher only wash full loads, and use cold water. LIne dry items when possible. If you use a dryer don't over fill it and take items out as soon as they are finshed to avoid running it again to get the wrinkles out, and don't over dry your clothes. You can also reduce the number of loads you do if you only wash dirty clothes. Many of us are in the habit of tossing items into the laundry even if we have only tried them on, many items may have only been worn for a few hours and items like jeans can often be worn a few times before they need to be laundered.     Wear a sweater in the winter so you don't need to use the heater as much, use a fan in the summer to feel cooler. Take showers instead of baths and make them as short as possible. Using an shampoo and conditioner all in one can save water as well as not washing your hair everyday.    Don't automatically turn on lights when you go into a room, use natural light when possible and turn off lights when you leave. This time of year it is a good idea to do a quick look at night and in the morning to make sure outside lights are turned off as well.|`|0KmJwYunaa	Buy local produce whenever possible.

Once upon a day there was a king. He did not want to make dirty his feet while we walk. So he called a meeting to solve the problem. All ministers offers many different solution such as, covering the country by carpet, or a group of labor keep unrolling and rolling a carpet when the king is walking. Finally a humble shoe maker came and advises to cover the feet of the king by leather. That is how the shoe was invented.     Same as the shoe inventing, we may not do recycling neither land filling but stop using polythene immediately. How does it sound? Wow! I am a genius. I just invented the solution.     Sorry, I did not invent. I have learned this from other humble country as Bangladesh.|`|wHVx9HZVaa	Being a 14 year old girl I would guess that your personal power consumption is pretty high.  Hair straighteners, hairdryers, long baths or showers and strong lightbulbs for applying makeup. Let your hair dry naturally, straighten only when you really need to look amazing, get a decent daylight bulb for applying makeup and a magnifying mirror (ask your mum to buy you one) and cut down on the depth of a bath or the length of a shower.  How many days do you wear the same clothes? Is it really necessary to wash everything after one wear? Perhaps that t-shirt could be aired and worn again or that pair of trousers worn two or three days. What temperature do you or your mother wash at? Turn the temp down. It really isn't necessary to wash things above 40 or even 30C nowadays unless your clothes are covered in mud!  Do you have the use of a computer? Turn it off and unplug when you walk away.  Get your parents to invest in longlife lightbulbs and turn them off when you are not in the room. Shut doors and draw curtains when dark and cold. Make a draught excluder to go at the base of the draughtiest doors.  http://www.hippyshopper.com/draught_excl...  http://www.moneymagpie.com/showPage/make...  If you feel cold put a woolly jumper on and don't turn the thermostat above 18/20C. That is plenty warm enough for anyone.  Eat and drink things when they are hot, don't waste energy microwaving things because you left them to go cold.
