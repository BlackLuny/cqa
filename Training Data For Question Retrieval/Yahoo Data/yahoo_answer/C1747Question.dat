20090304153246AASOnEF	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Is the 'war on drugs' a farce?	Definition of 'farce':  A ludicrous, empty show;      This was a quote from a phone interview with Terence McKenna, Canadian philosopher (August 1996):       http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/art...       "Drugs, prison building and the criminalization of the non-white underclass is a vicious racket that will never be put out of business by proving that this or that drug is harmless or useful. Keeping drugs illegal and highly profitable is near the top of the agenda of international criminal syndicates, mendacious governments, maverick intelligence agencies, the mass media and their stooges."

20090304153105AA0TANp	News & Events;Current Events	What is up with Britain lately?	A bit long but I had to explain what I'm asking about.      Some support Israel's recent defensive operation, some say they should have just shut up and let Hamas bomb their civilians. Each one is entitled to his opinion, but seriously, what is up with what I see on the news during the past week?      * First, Britain announced an academic boycott on Israel[Meaning, they won't cooperate or partake in any research by Israeli scientists and academics].      * Secondly, Britain released an announcement stating we should talk to "Hamas", an organization who stated numerous times that even if peace was signed between the Palestinian authority and Israel, they wouldn't accept it since the only way for the conflict to end is by "killing every Jew in the Middle East". Nice organization to support. One of Hamas's parliament members also stated in a speech that Israel is the first and later they'll conquer the rest of Europe and America:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUVxxjuK-...       * And now - Britain said it will establish relationship with the Hezbollah. Ironically enough, just recently, Hezbollah's leader gave a speech in which he stated, among other things, that his organization won't have any relationship/negotiations with Israel as it wishes to destroy it(Along with its inhabitants). Is this the kind of position Britain partakes in now?      Did all those brainwashing speeches in the mosques against Israel pay off? Did some kind of Muslim lobby took over Britain?    And a bit more far-fetched - Will Britain be the first country to leave the EU and join the OIC[Organization of the Islamic Conference, aka, the Islamic Union], because according to these stances, they certainly seem to be on their way there.       I'd love to hear some opinions/thoughts, especially from British folks. Do you support these stances? Do you support terror organizations? And more importantly - have you forgotten 7/7?
