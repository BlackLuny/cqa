r1D9P4Vyaa	He does sound a little touchy with the brake but they can do it when they want to. Just make sure you have plenty of stopping room (which you did) but apply the brakes ever so slightly early er . Also the instructors want to see the head movement when at stops, look Twice, each way, before going again. And when driving they like to see you always checking your mirrors, again head movement, they can`t tell if just your eyes are moving. And last just try to be calm, I know it is hard but this really helps. When I went for my Big Rig class A license I was a nervous wreck, my co-worker gave me the best advise as to be calm. He said to go into the test as if you don`t care if you pass or not, just drive. It Worked! And I got a 85%!

a69e9e5331e67cb5a7b70b479c19e388aa	Oui, le passage sur le dos est possible depuis 1920, sa durée étant limité sur certains avions par l'injection de carburant, sur d'autres par l'injection d'huile (celle-ci peut être rendue infinie par la mise en place d'un kit "Kristen" par exemple, qui permet la circulation d'huile "dans les deux sens", par un système de bille qui va tant?t permettre la situation "à l'endroit", tant?t "à l'envers").<br>  Par ailleurs il est à noter que les profils d'ailes employés n'étaient pas faits "pour ?a", donc les appareils en vol dos perdaient fortement de leur portance.<br>  Pour finir je pense que le passage sur le dos devait être d'un intérêt tactique très limité pendant la guerre d'Indochine, étant donné que le combat air-air était quasi-inexistant (donc pas d'ennemi à semer ou à descendre en combat canon) et que les avions voués à l'attaque au sol étaient blindés à l'intrados ( "le dessous" de l'avion), donc aucun intérêt pour le pilote de se mettre sur le dos pour exposer la face la moins défendue de l'appareil !<br>  Pour conclure, oui les chasseurs de la guerre d'Indochine pouvaient passer sur le dos mais ?a ne devait pas leur servir à grand chose si ce n'est raconter de chouettes histoires aux petits enfants de pilotes !|`|0d42525af90f48c625c5b5331cf88e92aa	pas de voler sur le dos !!!!!mais de passer en vol dos<br>  oui tous les avions ont cette possibilité !! plus ou moins longue selon leur configuration car certain ne sont plus alimenté en carburant pendant cette phase de vol et d'autre on un réservoir vol dos !! qui permet une alimentation des moteurs pendant un temps assez cour et qui ce remplissent de nouveau en vol normal<br>  pour ce qui ai de la sustentation ce type de phase ne pose aucun probléme même un hélico peu le faire maintenant cela dépend de la maitrise du pilote|`|6f054f71b80786c0da4ad38cba5625f3aa	oui, même dans les années 20!|`|81d460c82ad294cf546f06687abfc813aa	Exact, même dans les années 20 !<br>  Mais bon il faut aussi savoir qu'ils ne passaient pas leur tempas à voler sur le dos, ils en étaient juste capable, voilà tout !|`|1afd21935c15d926cc2c32077bce42a4aa	le f4e aeronavale, le p49 qui etaient assez courant en indochine.<br>  L'aviation francaise d'apres guerre disposait de beaucoup de modeles americains y compris pour les transports de troupes ou de marchandises (dc3), il faudra attendre la deuxieme partie des annees cinquante pour revoir une production d'avion francais|`|b256bbde9624411a4e7395562b043d51aa	Oui, bien s?r, tant qu'il ne passe pas tout leur temps à ?a, quasiment tous les avions peuvent voler sur le dos, il suffit qu'ils adaptent leur angle d'attaque pour que la portance se produise. Evidemment ce n'est pas toujours génial.<br>  <br>  je sais qu'une réponse fausse à la question de la portance est couramment apportée, et implique que les avions ne peuvent pas voler sur le dos.

sJNDP35Raa	Yes, anyone can take business classes and graduate with a business degree.  That is why starting salaries for business majors aren't very high.  <br>  <br>  However, if you are inexplicably drawn to it and think it's the cat's meow....well, you should go to business school.  Just make sure it is accredited.<br>  <br>  Anyone can be a doctor aas long as they are good at memorizing things and have the grades for it.  Honestly, if you're not into the idea of med school and don't have a desire to do it, then it will be a waste of your time and money (regardless of who pays for it).  Becoming a doctor isn't as lucrative as it used to be with the costs of malpractice insurance skyrocketing.  If you want to make serious money in the long run, business is the way to go assuming you have the acumen for it.<br>  <br>  If you want to make lots of money, try becoming an actuary or an CPA/accountant (not kidding).|`|edc776c66ff1bf2284c94dac9f013e3caa	I work at a large medical school. We ALWAYS tell pre-med applicants to study what most interests them - NOT necessarily sciences, anatomy, etc. - as that is the only way they will be able to maintain sufficient grades and have a chance at a successful application. You can always take medical prerequisites alongside your business courses, making sure of course that you don't overload yourself too much to maintain the all-important balance.<br>  <br>  I know several medical students who ran their own businesses before entering med school, and who are doing quite well.<br>  <br>  I do not think 'just anyone' can do it, but if you are interested, work hard, and avoid distractions you have every chance of success. I agree with Amber Eyes' recommendation (actuary/CPA), that would fit with the areas you are interested in.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11504682	Its YOUR life<br>  Do what you want<br>  ...unless they are paying for college...|`|bf02f2f0bef6ab8759f52b2f5e77ca9aaa	Sure, anyone can open a business, but it takes a talented person to run a successful business.

DDYZFcnHaa	I think the real problem involves consumption.  While the company would feel the burden in that month, they would see extra spending for the other 11 months (because somebody else would be boycotted).... so unless consumption of gasoline is decreased permanently and across the board, no company will feel a hurt they can't live with....<br>  <br>  Add to that the difficulty in convincing and organising the boycott (who decides which company to boycott), the regionalization problem (I have oil companies in my state that don't exist in 40 others, and vice versa), how does the information spread.... etc....<br>  <br>  The boycott just isn't something we can pull off with any measure of scale or success (even if it did work... which I contend it wouldn't since we only spend more at other oil companies)....<br>  <br>  Which bring it all back to the real solution.... reducing consumption.  We're a nation of commuters.  Some of the people in my church are driving only half a mile to get there.... that really isn't that far, maybe a five to ten minute walk at the most.... We have to effectively and significantly reduce our consumption before the oil companies will feel anything....<br>  <br>  Of course... for what it's worth.... capitalist economics will prevent even that from truly damaging the companies... because as we reduce consumption, they will simply increase price to an equilibrium we are all willing to live with.... <br>  <br>  On that note... if you've ever studied macro economics, you'll remember the principle of 'willingness to pay'.  Simply that people will pay what they are willing to pay and companies will charge what people are willing to pay (after all... if nobody bought gas at all... from any oil company... ever... the oil companies would eventually fold).  So really and truly, capitalism places the blame squarely on the shoulders of the consumer.... the price is high because we are willing to pay it.<br>  <br>  I remember a few years back, the media went into 'consumer protection' mode and told us all about how the gas prices were going to skyrocket over the summer..... well wouldn't you know it, the very next day the prices had jumped 10-15 cents per gallon everywhere.... the oil companies aren't dumb... if the media says we're going to be paying more, people expect it..... and then people are willing to pay it.... match point to the oil companies...<br>  <br>  Sorry for the rambling.... the solution is to buy less always (not just for a month or not just from a single company) and set realistic thresholds where you refuse to buy gas even if it mean (gasp) that you have to walk a half a mile to church.|`|5BdKnpA2aa	It is not likely that boycotting one per month would do much more than a sneeze since ex:  Conoco, Phillips 66, and Union 76 are intertwined now.<br>  <br>  You have the same conditions with almost every major oil company.<br>  <br>  Also, the problems get tougher since everyone else seems to want everyone else to do what needs to be done and not have to be bothered.<br>  <br>  You would need unity and determination constant for that month and that my dear is something that the government and the oil companies all know will never happen.<br>  <br>  Plus, you have to remember, even if you did get enough people to agree and carry thru, which would be fantastic, our wonderful government would of course have to bail them out due to their loses.  So, we the people still end up in the end paying.<br>  <br>  Of course that is just my personal opinion...|`|JNM6QrIVaa	That would make sense except they would not consider it a loss year round if when your boycotting another station, more people buy from them...it would be a wash.  And IF it did work to lower prices, why would most people wait to pay less for gas, so it wouldnt last and again, prices would go back up.  A better solution would be to use some type of hydrogen on demand from the power already being produced by your alt.  for the mechanically inclined, it would do more good all the time.....
d82fcd44a7e95a000024e72ae8bbffdbaa	Start at one end of the problem and work your way back. Take the connector off the washer pump and hook up a multimeter and have someone move the switch back anf forth. Then see if you get any voltage.

pdVegnQCaa	I have been riding and racing motorcycles for over 40 years. When I started riding there were no quats.<br>  <br>  I am glad that there were no quats when I was young or I may have wound up with one of those stupid things. I think that they were originally called squats because they are for people who squat to p-ss. Later shortened to quats.<br>  <br>  Just kidding; as said above they seem safer but they are actually more dangerous. The platform that seems so stable on flat ground is very unstable on uneven terrain. When they inevitabley roll they tend to roll or fall on top of the rider and they weigh twice as much as a bike. They are extremely dangerous and difficult to handle at high speeds on rough terrain.<br>  <br>  The biggest problem with quats is that they seem so stable and they are so very easy to operate that people who are brain dead ride them without any training whatsoever. People send kids out on them and we experienced offroad riders find ourselves having to dodge them as they ride around seemingly in their own little worlds they never look left or right as the are riding and inevitably we watch helicopters airlifting these idiots out constantly.<br>  <br>  They are fine for women and the elderly. Kids should stay off of them and I can't imagine a real man actually riding one. Me and my riding buddies stay away from them and we won't ride with guys mounted on them. People who try to keep up with us on quats always wind up crashing and getting hurt.<br>  <br>  Conclusions there are no advantages to a squat. Motorcycles on the other hand are fun, light, agile and can handle any terrain. I recommend a motorcycle safety course like the one offered by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF).<br>  <br>  As far as size of bike? You didn't give much information, so it's tuff to say if you are 3 1/2 feet tall get a 50cc bike and if you are 6 1/2 feet tall get a 500cc bike.<br>  <br>  [;-)<br>  <br>  ..|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	With dirt bikes, personal water craft, quads, etc. it's only fun when you have folks to ride with. If all of your riding buddies are on quads, you will have more fun on a quad. If you know people that ride both I would go with a bike. I've ridden quads and dirt bikes and there is just no comparison. Dirt bikes are way more fun and challenging to me. For me the quad was much like the personal water craft, I got really bored with it after a few months. Just my opinion. As far as size, I would look at a 250 4-stroke woods bike like the Honda CRF250X. Yamaha WR-F250 or KTM XC-F 250.|`|5ad48390d67eef1bf45ef9d3d3c02fe2aa	Personally I would go with a dirt bike. More sensation. Honda and Yamaha make great dirtbikes. I wouldn't go with an on road/off road either. I would get a straight up dirt bike. Yamaha's YZ125 or YZ250 are great bikes that really go. So are Honda's CR125 and CR250. The 125 and 250 are the number of cubic centimeters or "cc's". Awesome bikes. Riding them is the most fun I've had in my life. Its a roller coaster!!! Have fun.|`|JgECLY6jaa	Not trying to dump cold water on your interest. But, coming from someone who works in a major trauma center in an ER, there have been tons of people getting seriously hurt & even killed from riding quads lately. Not saying that you can't get just as hurt on a dirtbike. There seems to be a trend of quads flipping or accidentally rolling over. I have a very close friend who is now paralized from the chest down from a quad rollover 10 yrs. ago when he was 18.<br>  Which ever you choose, make sure you are also choosing protective gear as well. Never, never, never ride with out a helmet PLEASE!!! Another thing w/ quad rollovers is that a lot of people can break their femurs (large bone in the thigh of your leg, largest bone in the body) when the quad rolls or if you get flipped off the quad your leg gets stuck under the handle bars and it snaps.<br>  If it were me, I'd go with a dirtbike which is not as heavy and cumbersome and doesn't flip over as easily. I myself am also interested in bikes. To me they seem to be better designed to handle speed, bumps & inclines.<br>  Hope this helps, be careful & good luck!|`|nwlCjANsaa	well i say quad, i have been riding quads for sometime now and they are more stable than any dirt bike going, quads roll when people try to do stupid things with them or they just think ya sit down and ride like in a car, ya need to move your body around when riding on uneven ground and the biggest advantage of a quad is ya can carry extra gear with you when ya want to do a long trail ride, i have pulled a lot of dirt bikes out of some good muddy spots as 4 wheel drive is better than 1 wheel drive any day and as far as accidents go dirt-bikers are high on the list here in b.c.for injuries and deaths and it really has nothing to do with the vehicle it's more so the rider, both unit's are only as safe as the rider on them and oh ya always wear a helmet and a chest protector if ya can get one, good luck.<br>  p.s.<br>  a good starter quad size would be 400 to 500cc utility type

Then again, it may be that the shop did not align your rear tires, or just did a poor job. <br>  <br>  If you get another alignment, ask for a before and after printout of your alignment specs; there will be a suggested range for castor, camber, toe and maybe more factors depending on their software, as well as what your car reads before they adjust its alignment and what it reads afterwards. If your car is within the specs in every category, then you have another problem to correct such as shocks/struts/springs/tie rods/mechanical damage, etc...Best of luck<br>  <br>  [Tires may be at fault in some instances, but if you just got new tires they don't sound like a probable cause for the pull.]

NRtqNelmaa	Your best bet would be to take it somewhere and have a charging system tester put on it. They can load the system with the tester and see if the alternator is capable of putting out it's rated amps. A voltage test alone can be misleading.|`|616ea6a97bb1635f1f5594ca5497b699aa	All you need is a volt meter.  Every multimeter I've ever seen has a "volts" selection.  Just flip the thing to "volts" and touch the electrodes to the battery posts and see if the voltage goes up when the engine is running.<br>  <br>  Some cars with sophisticated regulators may not register an increase in voltage when the battery doesn't need to be charged, but generally speaking, you should see the voltage increase from 12 volts to 13.5 volts when the engine is running.<br>  .|`|DDYZFcnHaa	monitor the voltage with a Voltmeter from idle clear through some upper rpms....<br>  <br>  the system voltage should never be outside of 12.5 - 14.5.... if it is, the VR is probably hosed. (though a tiny bit of deviance would be okay.... 12.4 won't kill you)|`|TbapWhwdaa	Hook a volt meter up to battery. Start engine. of voltage reading increases.  Regulator good.  Or if you want to actually check the voltage regulator and not the whole charging circuit, determine which wire goes from the voltage regulator to the field winding on your alternator or generator.  Check for voltage .  With engine shut down there should be no reading.   when engine reading there should be some reading, although you may need to bring the engine speed above idle to get a reading.  If the alternator/generator is not putting out with engine running and the regulator supplying battery voltage to it, then you have a bad alternator.  Otherwise the regulator is probably bad.  Most alternators have the regulator inside the alternator housing and they are replaced as a unit when either of them goes bad.  One more thing I forgot to mention is that assuming you are dealing with a 12V system when the voltage of the system reaches around 14VDC the voltage regulator should once again stop putting power to the field so that the battery does not get overcharged.  Although whenever I've seen someone that was concerned that their voltage regulator was not working it was a lack of charge rather than an overcharging issue,never the less I felt that I should add that because your question was how to check a voltage regulator, not what should I check if my battery is not getting charged.

If you plan to take it mudding... pull stumps... or live in a snowy climate, it will make itself worth it someday.<br>  <br>  Most trucks are automatics, but they are available in manual transmissions.... if you like manuals, then get the manual... you want a solid transmission in a truck...<br>  <br>  and junk like prerunner, x-runner, whatever... that's just marketing crap...<br>  <br>  Lastly, decide to what extent you need brute strength... if you're really only hauling smaller stuff, and don't plan to pull stumps or do any traditional truck stuff... then you may want to consider a compact truck... better gas mileage, and better for mudding.|`|YcE6oEvEaa	If your "muddin" your gonna want 4X4, or four wheel drive. Go with a FORD.........|`|78b622571d07cef88d557f767a6dcd02aa	Those are just the models of the trucks. Doesn't mean much excpept maybe different motors, and interior. I would recomend either a Ford or Dodge. They have both been rockin out in the truck scene. Ford has the F-450 and they are at the top of the performance truck market. And Dodge is doin good with reliability. Both are exceptional rigs, but the Ford is probably a little more your style. You can get a base 2008 4x4 Ford F-150 (that will serve its purpose for you just fine) for around $30,000. And they are made in America! Support this country and don't buy a crappy import truck. Our trucks are just fine, and most are better. Good luck!

RbsRpcIyaa	Yes, phone GMAC and see what the penalties would be to terminate the lease early. You will be charged for the mileage and whatever early termination fees exist.<br>  <br>  Don't go the repo route, either voluntary or involuntary. You will still be on the hook for the difference between what the car brings at auction and what you owe. With this situation being a lease, it will actually cost you more to do this, as lower lease payments mean less paid-out on the vehicle. You're looking at having to cough up thousands of dollars. Can't pay it? They can get a judgment against you and possibly garnish wages depending on what state you live in.|`|qjtzjC7Vaa	Phone GMAC, legally they are the owners of the car, they may tell you to bring the car to a certain dealer. You are breaking a lease, which means lots of penalties, you are over the allowed miles so again there will be a charge for that. If you don't pay it will count as a repossession on your credit. Basically your credit is ruined for the next 5 to 7 years. And there will be a legal judgment against you for the money you owe, they will try everything possible to get their money. The money you will end up owing will not be forgiven with the repossession.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	You should ANYTHING to avoid a repo. You still owe most of the money, you have no car, and your credit is ruined for seven years. Talk to your lease company to see if they can offer any kind of relief. Otherwise, look into a lease transfer where some takes over your lease. It doesn't affect your credit. Here's more about it:<br>  <a href="http://www.leaseguide.com/Articles/terminate.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.leaseguide.com/Articles/termi...</a><br>  <br>  .
AA10552262	Maybe you need to bring along someone who is a pro at aggressive negotiation. Most of the dealerships specialize in hiring guys that make it seem like they are doing you a favor by even selling to you. You have to make them work very hard making it even appear you are remotely interested. Kinda like if you want a guy to fall for you, you make him feel that if he has any hope of being your boyfriend he has to appease you. In other words you need to be acting very disinterested. You need to be very assertive in telling them "no, this doesn't work for me". While trying to avoid winning a title of "sexist" here, you need to have a strong figured male with you that looks daunting and intimidating. You want to send them a message of :" so you want MY money do you? Well now, that's very nice indeed. Why should I buy from you? What are you going to do for me? I can, especially in this market go and buy from your competitor down the street! I am the boss here...not you. Understand me?" While this may not work in every case, it is going to earn you their respect and they are going to know that they can not just steamroller over you.|`|Dvx9JquIaa	Did you originally intend to lease or did the "nice guy" talk you into it?|`|29WFvvNPaa	Don't pay it.  If you think they are wrong, paying anything on what they say you owe it admitting that you owe it.  I would look for a different company...Go to them and tell them that you want a car with them, but if it is under those conditions, then they can forget it.  If they need the sale badly, they'll give you a break.|`|3804c41362b69be635d5ce9b2c2404d3aa	1st of all , make sure your credit is good so they have no leverage over you. Go in there tell the dealer exactly what you want and how much you are willing to pay. Tell him that you will not stand for the run around and he has one chance to get it right or you are heading down the rd to the next dealership. And mean it!   If he comes back from his finance mgr with some lame offer, go into the finance mgr's  office and say "I gave your salesman 1 chance and he failed-now I am done with him, I will give you the same offer. Either give me the deal I want or see you later!"<br>  <br>  Whatever you do -don't let them do the back and forth game between the salesman and finance mgr.|`|RbsRpcIyaa	Wow... many issues here that are not based on reality, but are based on emotion. <br>  <br>  Not trying to lecture, but I'll take this one at a time based on your quotes:<br>  <br>  "Heres my issue...I have a leased car which I am over mileage on, and I still have 8 months to go. I basically owe $2200 to GMAC which I have been told I will have to roll into another car." --- You would owe this money if you terminated the lease early. If you are merely trading your car in earlier than lease end, it is still bound by what the book value is. Are they asking for $2200 down if you traded in? Or is this $2200 if you terminated the lease early and walked away from the car? Where is this $2200 figure coming from?<br>  <br>  "Now the issue is, I want to buy a car from GM so I can keep my pmt. down and not worry about miles anymore, and I am even willing to "downgrade" to a less expensive car." --- Here is where leasing hurts you. Since you pay lower monthly payments on a lease than a traditional finance option, you will owe more on the car if you try to trade it in. 90% of the time, when a lease is involved, the customer is upside-down on their vehicle when they try to trade it in early. That negative equity has to go somewhere. It doesn't magically go away because you are in a "tough situation and don't want to get screwed". Also, trying to trade into a less expensive vehicle when you have a negative equity situation is always almost impossible. The negative equity has to be added to the new loan somehow (it can be "hidden" to make you think it's not, but it's there), which adds to your payment. <br>  <br>  "The dealerships are not willing to help me, they all are charging me MSRP according to what I have seen online. Then adding in the $2200 into that, making my payment outrageous." --- According to what online? Every car has a different MSRP. And yes, as mentioned before, that $2200 has to go somewhere. the dealer has a harder time discounting a vehicle if they have to overcome the negative equity.<br>  <br>  "I intended on leasing...last time, I had a car which I owed 1800 more than its trade in value, so every dealership would roll that into my payment. This guy paid off the car so I didn't have to roll anything in. And got me into a lease cheaper than I found anywhere else. (looked around for months)." --- I don't think you understand about negative equity. It MUST go somewhere into the new loan unless you have the cash to cover it. It doesn't magically go away as mentioned earlier. So, each time you traded in a car upside-down, you kept adding to the debt on the new car. If you've done this several times, you can really pile up a situation like you've mentioned here... where you have a significant amount owed versus what it's worth. The salesman you mention didn't magically pay off your car. He was able to hide that negative equity by overinflating your trade's worth, using whatever incentive on the car was available, or not discounting the new car. It happens every day. <br>  <br>  "AND I am beginning to think GM deserves to go bankrupt, because when you can't forgive an existing lease balance of 3,000 miles overage charges, and waive 6 lease payments in order to sell a car (which by the way I will be paying for over 6 years!) then you don't want the sale that bad." --- Wow. This whole paragraph is full of BS. Sorry. You signed a lease agreement and are bound to it. So is GM. They cannot just "forgive" anything. And no auto company is going to waive 6 months of payments. This is where I believe your emotion is talking, not your common sense. <br>  <br>  You mentioned that you've been paying on that car "for over 6 years". Was this really a lease? I've never heard of GMAC leasing a car for over 4 years, and even third-party leasing companies hate to go 5 years, but will in a pinch on high-end luxury vehicles. <br>  <br>  Honest advice? Never use leasing just to get a lower payment. This is the end result if you have to trade early or end the lease early. If you go into a deal as a "payment buyer", you lose every single time.<br>  <br>  **EDIT -- folks, you can walk into a dealership and be as aggressive as  you wish, but it always comes down to the numbers. If you're uncomfy with it, walk. Plain and simple. But be reasonable. You can't expect dealers to try and "forgive" or "waive" anything when they are bound legally to not be able to. <br>  <br>  To the poster above me: The person being female has no bearing on this deal. If a salesman is not giving you the attention you deserve and you feel it's because you're female, then walk. Plain and simple. If you're sitting at a desk with the salesman and your male companion, and the salesman keeps directing questions to the male's attention, stop the negotiations and state, "I need to be clear... this is my car, my deal. Now, let's continue with that in mind." A good salesman will indeed do so.|`|gEw83TRTaa	WOW.  just plain wow.<br>  <br>  You really need to just stop at this point.  You think someone should want your business so badly that they would ignore a tremendouse deficit on the lease you are currently in?  Gee, I wonder if that would HELP or HURT the balance sheet?<br>  <br>  Dealers are not in business to be charities.  They are in business to make money.  Thats how they employ salespeople, managers, lube techs, receptionists and clerks.  If they just "forgave" over $3000 in milegage AND the 6 payments (which will likely be over $5000 total) who would pay that? <br>  <br>  You made the contract, its your obligation.<br>  <br>  Rolling the negative from one car to the next is a big financial mistake.  You wind up paying even more for the car than you should, then you end up buried even longer.  They are doing you a financial favor by not letting you do this.  Then, 2-3 yrs from now when you decide you want another car, you will be so buried you cant get out with a backhoe.<br>  <br>  You intend on leasing???  for six years?  There is so much wrong with that idea I dont know where to start.  Leases are not designed for long term ownership.  They are best for 2 yrs, 3 max.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but every idea here is just bad.  You are mking a tremendous financial hole for yourself.  And apparently cant see that you are on the path to fiscal ruin.  Stop now.  Adjust your buying habits or become another repo/bankruptcy statistic soon.<br>  <br>  its not what you want to hear, and I am sure the 'thumbs down' will flow.  But the truth isnt always nice and pretty with a big bow on it.

AA10721138	If your looking for loud and deep for a budget sub. Look into Elemental Designs, they make excellent equipment. Had 2 of their 13Ov.2 subs in my previous car, they shook the whold damn car. I could turn the volume up and just sit there and watch my review mirror just fall with in seconds. They hit hard, fast and low. For the money you will not find anything better, not even Alpine. Google Elemental Designs, you can thank me later. Oh yeah, forgot to mention, everything that they make comes with a  year warranty.|`|2gzy7DwWaa	Iv never hear of the brand. But if your going to spend $150 on each speaker i rather go with 2 alpine type R's they will run you the same price and it is a high quality speaker sounds good for any kind of bass and looks better then the one you looking to. For more questions just email me chubby1_8888@yahoo.com|`|AA11318686	Any subs that you can buy for $300 per pair are going to be crap.  I would suggest going with a pair of MTX 7500 series 12's they're probably going to set you back atleast $250 each but will actually handle what they claim they can and will last forever and a day.
AA11318686	I see your idea behind this and it's also the reason that for years MTX wouldn't make a square sub.  It's because if you use a shape that's not a circle you're going to have points on the cone that will have more stress on them, but in the case of speakers that have an xmax of maybe 1/4" you don't have much to worry about because the amount of stress they're undergoing wouldn't be enough to damage the speakers whereas a sub that can have an xmax of up to an inch would get damaged from having a cone that's not round. but if you take a 6x9 and a 6 1/2 that have the same xmax the 6x9 will be louder because it's got more sd or cone surface area.|`|AA10721138	The answer lies in the cone space, a 6X9 is going to have more cone space that a 5.25" or a 6.5", so yes the 6X9 is going to have the heavier sound. But the 6.5" will sound richer.|`|n8UBfhgpaa	This all depends on your stereo setup. 6x9s tend to give alot more base than a 5" round. If you are setting up subwoofers and an amp in your car than I always reccommend 5 and a quarter rounds in the back and in the front door skin I like 5 and a quarter, and a 2 inch tweet on each side. Because you will get plenty of bass from the subs. But with no base the 6x9s provide a really good sound, so I would put them in the back with the same front setup as before.|`|6u07c7Hraa	6 by 9  is the way to go m8, u will get much better sound!<br>  <br>  FACT

Since he doesn't take himself too seriously, he actually GETS TAKEN SERIOUSLY. <br>  <br>  If HD William is for real, he is exactly the sort of douche that causes other riders to be suspicious of the HD crowd. <br>  <br>  Even though I don't own a HD now, I have in the past, and I will probably own another. I have been around that crowd for years. There are tons of great people and great riders who are out on Harleys. It's a shame that the "fake biker/weekend badass" make the whole group look bad. <br>  <br>  Motorcycles are supposed to be fun. A person should smile when they are riding!|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Amen FTW. No I do not think HD Willy is for real and seriously doubt that he owns a Harley. Sometimes he can be witty and almost funny if you don't take him seriously, but much of the time it is just a sarcastic regurgitation of the same old tired Harley rhetoric. Of course at least he is trying to be funny in his own strange way. It's folks like ninebadthings that really upset me. I don't even own a Harley but attitudes like his that draw a line between fellow motorcyclist aren't good for anyone. He admits in his answer to this question that it is the way some Harley riders look that bothers him. Last time I checked that was just blatant bigotry. There's enough of that in the world as it is. Maybe he just has an inferiority complex, who knows. As to Freak Show's answer, I didn't realize there was some special criteria one has to meet or a certain score on the "cool meter" you had to reach before buying a Harley. Why worry about anyone else's motive for riding whatever they choose?|`|98NiEivhaa	I don't care about hd billy-bob, he's actually pretty entertaining and seems to just want to stir the pot.<br>  ninebadteeth though, there's an idiot, anything harley related he feels it necessary to jump in to sh*t on things, and says he likes a triumph bonneville? wtf??? that is the bike closest to the sportster 883 on the market, same styling, power, everything.... that guy is a douchebag without a clue and too chicken to say anything face to face, always from behind the security of his keyboard|`|b6b39d8ead41fa59eb797e4257979b83aa	Not only is he real, but he's the baddest, most handsome, smartest guy out there.  And he rides a real Harley and is a true enthusiast as evidenced by the excellent and cool HD licensed costumes he wears - sometimes 2 different ones per day.|`|QNAI0jeYaa	He supposedly lives by me and wouldn't even respond to a message i sent him. I really didn't know i was that big and bad.|`|9rzG2shHaa	He is really the Easter Bunny, just wants a new tough-guy HD rider image! Then he can deliver HD products instead of eggs.|`|rL6pjSFnaa	He is a Posser just like Chopperridder ! chopperridder at least sends funny e mails threatening people that upset her !|`|RZmJ8SKVaa	There are a million of these guys out there, but many more people that have HD's that are not like this.<br>  <br>  I am a Honda guy, I always have been, and I likely will be for a long time into the future.  I have no desire to parade around like a jacka**, I can be my own jacka** with or without my bike!<br>  <br>  Folks, the bike is the conveyence, and then there is the journey and destination, in which I enjoy the journey most.<br>  <br>  Have your HD, that is fine, even stir the pot occasionally, that is in good fun too, but please don't ask me to take any of it seriously, there is really nothing to take serious.|`|i6NGGj73aa	No - he's just a clown with a big imagination and a keyboard.Most H.D. owners are just ordinary folk that are proud of their bikes.We don't pull wheelies or scream about the streets like some of the sportsbike crowd.To us it's about the bike - the ride - the freedom.Besides if I have to explain you wouldn't understand.<br>  <br>  Late add on: I ride a sportster Billy boy dip$hit - I don't think I'm god's gift to the biker scene.I'm just Joe average - but if I was gonna hit you I'd use a Kenworth truck!|`|AA11452547	He's hot.  I'd do him.|`|5479a64aee205b311c9247d088f72b60aa	Unfortunatly HD William is probably a real Harley owner.  In recent years there have been a large number of "Rich Urban Bikers" (known as RUBes) who like the image of the Harley, but are not like the core of tough as nails REAL Harley owners who live to ride and ride to live.  Despite guys like HD William Harley will always have the reputation as the best hard core bike on the road.  At least he supports America and rides a real bike with the legandary V Twin dressed like a real biker(unlike the little commies who buy tiny little Jap bikes and ride around in neon color leather unitards with plastic knee pads).  Ride loud and ride proud...
AA10137828	>>>Assuming my internal parts are fine <<<<br>  <br>  If that is the case, why tear it down anyway?<br>  <br>  If the crank is within spec you can polish and re-use it. Same with the cam. Take the heads and the stem seals from the gasket kit and let the shop do those. They will check spring tension and replace as needed. On the block, be sure to remove all "freeze" plugs and flush the water passages very well. Be sure to clean all oil galleys as well. Unless replacing, keep the lifters and pushrods separated so they go back in the same bore.<br>  <br>  It would really be wise to replace the pistons. The way the rings fit in the grooves is critical. Trying to re-use the chain and gears is a false economy also. A new chain and gear set is less than $20.00. You might also want to have the machine shop check the bore and repair as needed. An overbore isn't expensive at all. <br>  <br>  Cost will depend on where you buy your parts and the machine work, but the parts you will need (minus crank and cam but including pistons) would be around 4 to 5 hundred bucks from my supplier. <br>  <br>  If you look online, you can find some good deals on engine kits.|`|sEDGYy03aa	I would just use it a core deposit.  The problem with putting used parts back in is that there is chance they will break too.  you have to tear the engine again.  Yes it is more expensive, but in the long run, the engine will out last the truck.

AA11493630	If you had the money right then and there you could probably talk him down a little.|`|Mdax9soJaa	it really depends on the car...for example, 2007 Toyota Yaris sedan...MSRP is $12,025.    Invoice is: $11,303.  so that means we're talking about $722 margin of profit here for the dealership which is really not a whole lot of room for discount...however, if you happen to go to the dealership ready to buy a car during the weekdays like Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday then you have a good chance to get some discounts off a car..because normally between Tuesday thru Thursday are slow days and they want to make it happen to earn your business...Friday, Sat and Sun are weekend sale event promo...<br>  so with 2007 Toyota Yaris sedan for example again, they might be able to roll the deal for $500 over invoice. good luck|`|FdwX8oFvaa	Offer cash. <br>  <br>  Have something (any junker will work) to trade.

HF4c1y6laa	whichever answer gives me 10 points|`|KtQdOqHKaa	Short answer, no.<br>  <br>  Long answer, VTEC is honda's variable valve timing and lift technology, the only way to "put a vtec" into a bmw would be an engine swap.  This is never a cheap option when going between cars from different manufacturers (and also usually between different models from the same manufaturer).<br>  <br>  The closest technology that bmw offer is VANOS.  This is only a variable valve timing system (no variable lift).|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	VTEC is Honda's proprietary variable valve timing system.  Naturally is uses only Honda parts on Honda motors.  BMW, like most manufacturers today has their own VVT system that does pretty much the same thing so you don't need VTEC.|`|f3e5e4d7af5d1a05594696425078e04faa	yes but WHY?????

ZftI0W4Eaa	I would go to the manager, they probably have camera's there and can prove who took it. if they say that they're not responsible then tell them that you don't hold them responsible but you want to look at the cameras to see who took them, you can then report them to the police and get the stolen items back.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Tell the dealership and ask what they are going to do about it.|`|94faf4d1d380dfc7f0731bbb8873018eaa	While you have probably signed away all your rights, do give a description of the items to the garage manager. If he sees an employee carrying these around he could ask them to hand them in, If there are identifying marks or particular music on there, he may be able to check these for you.<br>   You can't use the garage but they may be able to help you to make sure you keep coming back to them|`|BZMPax7Naa	You may find that there is a policy there that you need to remove all valuables from your car before having work done.  It's just common sense.  Chances are they won't be able to do anything about it.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	I would sure notify the dealer and see what they say. Obviously the have a thief in their service dept.

Just don't expect anything unless it is insured.|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	Do you have homeowners or renter's insurance? if so, check with them SOME will cover items stolen from your car.  NOT your auto insurance... they cover damages and medical.<br>  <br>  You will need to file a police report and of course you should notify the management. They might have an employee with a history of sticky fingers accusations.  Those add up over time and eventually he/she will get caught.|`|J1Frx83haa	HMMMM, idkk ?<br>  most dealerships clean the car after you bring it in.. so maybe thats what they were doing, did you make sure they didnt just move it ?<br>  <br>  i would bring it to the attention, cause they would have to have on record who serviced your car, and then you can get your ipods back :D<br>  i hope it all works out, :/|`|N8DxgAD7aa	Get a new iPod, an iPod in a car is never insured.

i5Y320Wraa	The airbags deploying is not really an inicator to the other persons speed. Airbags deploy so long as their is motion and the place of impact. Based on what you said I would say the car was travelling about 10-15mph.|`|1hciyvKdaa	I hope you called teh police and got a report on that, the pd and your or thier insurance company is trained to estimate speeds on collisions from the type of damage. My airbags went off after I was at a complete stop, so thats not an actual indicator, to me anyhow. My car got hit the other person barely made my car move, he was slowing he was almost stopped too, so like 15 max, and it totalled my car :( he got NO damage but a tiny tiny dent in his front grill you couldnt see wihout looking, my car was thrown away. I hope your ok, dont feel sorry, get that car fixed, and if you are sore at all, go to the Drs today. Ill tell you why, my tiny neck ache the next day, has left me 4 years later with intermident neck problems, I messed up on not getting enough help, dont dismiss any type of injury no matter how small.

Check to see if you left something on like the interior light or the parking lights.|`|3LwTU9duaa	it might have nothing to do with the rain if thats what your thinking..its possible you left your lights on or something else on that would make your battery go dead..|`|X6C6kZKKaa	check you battery conections. clean them up.|`|nvfEqG00aa	battery might be dead. try get someone to jump it for you|`|SBF3S5I8aa	check the contact between the battery and then cable it self your battery may be fine it may just not be connected.

6364919df68080988a9ed48b98d4ee45aa	I just took the train today as I relocated to Daytona from NYC. the previous answer is a good one I must admit. here are some inclusions:<br>  <br>  - if you are going soon the coach accomodations this time of year are not that bad and much cheaper. the train is pretty empty going south as most of the snowbirds are heading up north. i got a seat by myself and could semi stretch out(always be extra nice checking in as the folks are good people and will help you if the accomodations are there).<br>  - no wifi does blow but they do have outlets so you dont have to worry about your battery dying.i loaded up on games and movies and the trip wasnt too bad. they do play a movie several times and it was Enchanted going south<br>  - dinner and a lite continental b'fast are included. you can buy drinks or snacks for extra $$. the only part that can be bad is that to maximize space you have to sit with other folks most times. to be honest I have taken it 3 times and always met nnice and polite people even if they arent the most interesting.<br>  -the last time they will take your car is 3PM. you cannot board until 2:30PM. once you check in and give them your car you cannot get into it again. the train was delayed today and there were people lined up at 11AM to get into the station.why????????????? they would be sitting for hours. when you get to lorton and are early go get something to eat and get snacks from local stores before heading in.<br>  -bring your own blanket and pillow(s). they do give you a tiny pillow and a thin blanket but taking your own makes it much much better<br>  - you can alos contact amtrak if you need kosher, low sodium, etc and they are more than accomodating.<br>  - the only truly annoying part is waiting for your car but to be honest it is always handled better in FLA than VA.<br>  <br>  hope this helps. good luck with your trip and relocation|`|2EVoNHHbaa	Let me clarify.  On the Auto Train, you have a choice of riding coach (which means you have a seat along an aisle), or you can book a private compartment.  There are four types of compartments: Bedroom, Roommette, Family Bedroom, and Handicapped Bedroom.  Traveling by yourself, the Roommette makes the most sense.  During the day it provides you with two seats (one to sit on and one to dump some of your stuff on), which converts at night into a full-length bed, with a door to provide privacy.<br>  <br>  The Auto Train doesn't have wi-fi.  Meals are complimentary for all passengers, including those riding in coach and those riding in compartments.  The meals for those riding in compartments ("first class"), are more up-scale in what they serve.<br>  <br>  Some friends of mine have put together an excellent guide to riding the Auto Train, that will answer any other questions you may have.  Here's a link:<br>  <a href="http://www.on-track-on-line.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.on-track-on-line.com</a><br>  <br>  And then click on "Auto Train Tips".
ZHuQWwWqaa	JB Weld might work if you clean the area good.  Also Marine Tex could work too.  I fixed a Thermostat Housing and a 2 Radiators with it.<br>  <br>    Drill out the hole to cut out the damage and to have a good perfect circle.  The hole should be just big enough to cut out the hole that you are fixing, so use the actual hole as a guide.  The brass plugs comes in different sizes so make the whole to the next smallest.  You do not want to end up with a huge Puka on it.  Be carefull of metal shavings, brass shavings are ok, steel is not a good thing.  To do it even better, remove the oil pan and work it outside the car.<br>  <br>  Use a variable speed drill and go easy with it.  If you go full speed you will sling all the shavings everywhere in the oil pan, if the pan is installed in the engine.  If the hole is at the bottom of the pan, spray Carb cleaner from  the drain hole so it will flush out the oil with the metal shavings.  If is on the side, try to spray from the same hole so will go to the drain hole.  You might want to add some more oil, just enough to get some on the bottom, so when the shavings falls, it will stick to the oil and the cleaner will flush it away.  Try to flush from the top, so it comes out by gravity.<br>  <br>  Use the drill at a low speed, you want to grind it away, not shave it.  So get a variable speed drill.  Also the shavings will not be fliying everywhere inside the pan.<br>  <br>  If the hole is at the bottom of the pan, see if you can use the drain hole and use some carb cleaner.  Spray some from there so it will flush away the shavings and cleans the hole from any oil residues.<br>  <br>  <br>  Use a Brass Plug that you can buy in hardware stores.  <br>  <br>  Use your common sense and drill it small enough to kind of screw it. <br>  <br>  If you have a tap and die set, better yet.  You could "thread" the hole so it will screw in.<br>  <br>  Screw the plug coating really good the threats with Marine Tex and let it dry.  Like 24 or so hrs to be sure.<br>  <br>  That could work but is not a permanent fix. <br>  <br>  Service the engine, put the oil back in it.  Do not fire the engine without oil....!!!!!<br>  <br>  The Marine Tex, I paid $14 for it and $1.25 for a 3/8 Brass Plug in ACE hardware.<br>  <br>  Beyond that... Change the oil pan, see if you can buy one in a junk yard, that is the right way.  Also, if you can pull the pan, you could get it weld at a local welding shop.<br>  <br>    That was El Cheapo repair but at least done it somewhat right.|`|grBxTsK6aa	Yes, but you have to drive 100 miles per hour down a residential street to get it to seal the hole.|`|h9v7SQNlaa	Yes it does work!! I bought that stuff for my husband and he used it out side to hang some flower pots on our brick wall. He also used it to fix some things around the house.<br>  <br>  EDIT: wait....i have mighty putty not magic putty, so i dont know if it's the same stuff! Sorry.|`|3PFe94YGaa	No... it's not really magic... neither are those "magic" mr. clean sponges. You should sue for false advertising. For example, Lucky charms cereal, it isn't really lucky charms. It's food.|`|75y2Khhfaa	lol worth a try|`|mSpogzXCaa	I agree JB Weld is better, but the pan needs to be "very" clean or it will not stick to it.  You would need to take the pan off and clean the hole inside and out.|`|sJr3M0OLaa	ha, don't know
IVjspiStaa	Read the book that your local DMV provides. It is free!!!
zBhwEbUkaa	Motorcycles are generally louder because of the length of the exhaust system, comparatively to an automobile. The shorter you go, the louder you get.<br>  <br>  Motorcycles are under similar laws on noise restrictions as cars, it's just that not many law enforcement agencies crack down on them. This may be because there are not as many motorcycles as cars, so not as much noise pollution, or because there are so many manufacturers that produce these loud pipes. <br>  <br>  I am a bike rider and even I hate the loud bikes. It's just not necessary. I think that more should be done to quite down bikes, but the biker community is a tight-knit one and change does NOT come easily.|`|ttbXQEJ8aa	There are two noise regulations one for cars and one for motorcycles and trucks over 10000 gvwr. The MCs and trucks are allowed to be louder but only by 6 dec. (cars 84 dec trucks & MC 90 dec) and not the amount that is common when running straight or drag pipes.<br>  <br>   It actually comes down to the fact that most cops are too busy with more important things than noise enforcement. Where I live ticket for loud pipes is same as a parking ticket and cost a mere $10 w/ no court appearance. (speeding tickets are $100 and up) (here we have quite a bit of Diesel pick ups, Tuner cars, Lowriders & Hot Rods with exhaust even louder than a Harley with straight pipes)|`|0g2fDpUbaa	Actually, there are noise level restrictions on motorcycles.  I believe it's 90 db at 10 ft or so in my state.  It is enforced at times, usually at bike events.  A good example is one of the guys I ride with occasionally.  He goes to Myrtle Beach's Bike Week every year.  Everyone else comes back with a tshirt.  He comes back with a noise citation.  Yet every year he gets louder.  Last year he changed to gatling gun style pipes.<br>  The laws are on the books but they are not well enforced, same as the tinting laws.|`|48eb2dbb79fba479784347026d54127daa	Because motorcycles are prettier.|`|botH6rIQaa	similar to automobile sound systems,  it is just to big a job to enforce with the amount of police on the street.  The same thing with dirt bikes in the inner city,  police are told to look the other way,  so as not to become involved in a chase.  Loud cars,  small in number compared to bikes,  are easy to stop and they normally don't take off. Also most of the loud bikes are Harleys,  and what do you think the police ride....?|`|5s6iZ7OVaa	108 decibels in my state. My state's state police are cracking down on inspection stations.<br>  <br>  If you get your bike inspected, then switch your pipes after, you are putting your inspection station at risk. Not to mention you might be causing hearing damage.<br>  <br>  Although there's nothing more satisfying than creeping up next to the SUV soccer mom that just cut you off with her windows down, then hammering on the throttle with a race pipe fitted on your bike and catching her reaction in your mirror. Especially on a V-Twin.<br>  <br>  Hearing damage= when your ears feel mushy on the inside after, then when you're laying down to go to sleep you hear this constant ringing sound.|`|qT3bi1Ynaa	Why do people play the stereos loud, that should be illegal too.  Wait----- they are both illegal it is just that I want the police dealing with murders, rapists and thiefs rather than wasting their time on petty stuff.|`|iZypM5jtaa	its actually illegal for a bike to be loud. my bike is illegal at public riding places, i got a fourstroke with an aft mkt pipe and i rejetted it and all that and it blows flames. so im not aloud and its louddd|`|ghaETYwcaa	well loud pipes are illegal but massive civil disobediance makes is hard to enforce.My bikes are loud and will stay that way!

I think cars just can't run straight pipes because of emissions laws, not sound level laws. What I can't understand is why so many people that are obviously anti-bike frequent this section of YA. I find this quite interesting.|`|98NiEivhaa	Because in many jurisdictions, to make a sound ordinance stick... they must lab test the vehicle in a sound proof room for db.  And should the bike pass, they have a liability on their hands.  Opinion does not constitute an accurate measurement.  Cars can be fined because of emissions, where bikes can't be.<br>  Suck it up buttercup, I'm loud and proud
WrXY4Wm9aa	In an autoland type of situation, radar altimeters (usually 2) are wired into the autopilot. Barometric altimeters are not precise enough. The three barometric altimeters are independent of each other. That would give the pilots plenty of information available for them to intervene. Why they didn't do so soon enough will probably be a focus in the investigation.|`|eZGRV683aa	Usually everything is done in 3's (Redundant +1) Not sure about the altimeters, but I know the hydraulic lines are done in 3's (united 232)|`|GB5U7uPraa	Grumpy's answer is spot-on.  And I should caution everyone to severely discount any aircraft accident reporting done by someone who has a BA in English or Journalism.  You can count on them getting it wrong every time.  When they said the pilot's altimeter was wrong I immediately realized the reporter is off in the weeds because that's always a baro altimeter driven by one of two air data computers that each have their own pitot, static, and temp sources.  Autopilots will use baro altimeter for cruise.  (e.g., maintaining altitude and altitude capture)  But autoland, which is what they intimated was going on, always uses the radalt after glideslope capture.  As the ground draws close on short final (e.g., 50-100' above ground) the autoland logic will retard throttles, kickout drift, and flare the airplane.<br>  <br>  BTW, you're right about the redundancy.  There are numerous automatic and procedural crosschecks for altitude verification before an autoland operation commences.  There's something else amiss here in addition to the baro altimeter issue.|`|AA10721549	...or just a plain undercarriage switch, similar to those that autotrigger the FDRs once released after takeoff.<br>  <br>  i believe this is some kind of media twisted information, that has to be verified first.|`|L1cBV8qQaa	umm... don't believe everything you hear from the media...

I would say keep your tint dark, I had my jeep broken into but nothing was taken because well I made the hatch not unlock able without the key (cut the wire) and it won't fit out anywhere else, but they did just leave everything after they figured out they couldn't get it out in under 30 minutes. My tint was dark though they broke in I assume because they heard me driving and recognized the vehicle.<br>  <br>  It always better to be more safe than lose all the money you put into it and then have to repair your vehicle too.

Go to the web sites like NHTSA and do your research.<br>  2. Periodic renewal of driver's licenses is already a law in most states. The renewal process occurs every 3-5 years, and also includes vision, hearing and written tests that must be passed in order to renew the license. Additional rules are in place if the driver has had too many tickets or accidents within the 3 year time period.<br>  3.

Blaming the elderly, as a category is just poor judgement.  It is like when someone sees an example of a bad driver, and then, while pulling alongside of that car, making notice, like, "I KNEW it.  An old driver," or, "AHA! An Asian, just as I suspected," or, "A Hispanic driver.  Probably an illegal without a license or insurance."  The problem with these kinds of judgements is that, not only are they inaccurate stereotypes, if the driver turns out NOT to be one fitting whatever prejudged characateristic, then you don't think much about it and tend to forget the incident that made you look into that other car.<br>  <br>  It is only when the bad driver fits the "bad driver" stereotype that one tends to remember.<br>  <br>  You mentioned ONE, single incident where and 80 year old pulled out and caused a fatal collision.  Do you think that only 80 year olds make that kind of driving error?  Do you have any real data to support your "plan" to get a bill passed?  It seems that what you ARE doing is trying to find data that will support your preconceived notion, instead of doing any research to learn if any such bill SHOULD be introduced.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, look up research material at these sites.  Try the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation.  Try, also, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.  I may also suggest National Safety Council, and, the American Automobile Association Foundation.<br>  <br>  Get the REAL data before making any prejudgements about driving stereotypes.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	its a lot less than younger drivers who dont know how to drive yet.. and i think driver ed should be taught a couple yrs before  let a young person get license and then they should only be let to drive with another driver for like a year before being let lose a lone|`|jFwuiRKxaa	 Not as many as by younger drivers.

32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	It's normal to use the autopilot for most of the flight, including the approach to the airport, but a typical landing is flown by hand, and many pilots like to fly a large part of the approach by hand as well. Regulations require that the pilot take over at a certain point before landing, except for autolands (as explained below).<br>  <br>  It is possible to configure the airliner to land entirely under autopilot control ("autoland"), but this is only done when visibility is so poor that a hand-flown landing is impossible.  Sometimes pilots autoland for practice.  Only certain airports are equipped for autoland.<br>  <br>  When the autopilot is used for landings or the last part of an approach before a landing, functioning radar altimeters are mandatory. Pilots and airlines are supposed to know this, which means that they shouldn't allow planes without reliable radar altimeters to fly without being repaired.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, Turkish Airlines has the worst rate of accidents with fatalties per flights of any airline in the U.S. or Europe combined, by a wide margin.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	No, it is not.  Most runway instrument approach systems do not support autoland.  And even when it is available, the crew must be trained for it and the aircraft must be equipped for it.<br>  <br>  Some flying is automated, but the landings seldom are automated.|`|432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	Yes. <br>  <br>  There is an aviation joke which says that in a few years time, the only flight crew required will be a man and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to bite the man, if he tries to touch any of the controls.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	To land, no. To approach in grimy weather, yes.|`|FuvCgaEMaa	Is it 'normal'? It most certainly can be. Autopilots today can follow the glidepath right to the runway, idle the throttles, touch down on centreline, and deploy brakes and spoilers all by itself in a function known as "autoland".<br>  <br>  Most commercial jets are equipped with the autoland function. However, the airport must have the proper equipment (only found at major international hubs), and the airplane requires special  equipment as well: 3 separate autopilots all in agreement, comparators to ensure all instruments are in agreement, autothrust, among other things.<br>  <br>  Now I don't know much about Turkish Airlines, but at the company I work with (I'm not a pilot there yet, but I am familiar with this policy) the pilots must abort the autoland if ANY of their instruments are in disagreement. So if one altimeter reads 1000ft and the other reads 1050ft, the autolanding must be aborted.  That the altimeters are "misreading" leading to the crash, suggests to me that either all the altimeters on the plane are coincidently misreading the exact same, the pilots foolishly continued the approach violating the law, or the plane was not actually using the autoland.<br>  <br>  Perhaps what the article meant to say is that the aircraft was still on autopilot tracking the glideslope. The pilots wouldn't actually take control and land the plane until a certain altitude above ground (known as "minimums").<br>  <br>  Or you know what? Even when the pilots take over from the autopilot to hand-fly the rest of the landing, the autopilot will still manage the throttle known as "autothrust". Maybe the pilots were hand-flying the approach, but the autothrust either failed, or commanded the engines to power-up but got no response. That's exactly what happened to the British Airways 777 that landed short last year; the autothrottle was managing the power, but the engines just quit. Maybe what happened to British Airways is what happened to this Turkish Airlines flight.|`|91f68d84e5baee88c4ba91159a357ae4aa	Autoland is used in poor weather with some aircraft and at some airports, not all by any means, and very rarely in good visibility unless the pilots are particularly indolent. <br>  <br>  More like they're talking about the autothrottle alone, but any pilot who relies on a system using an already suspect altimeter wants his head examining - if still able. At the very least you'd be watching like a hawk with hand VERY near the controls. Most pilots I know wouldn't trust it an inch in those circumstances, me included.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I know they're dead, but it sounds very like abysmal flying skills.|`|WrXY4Wm9aa	No. While it might be common to fly coupled approaches, most pilots will kick off the autopilot at around somwhere above minimums, and hand fly the plane to touchdown. <br>  <br>  If the news article is anywhere near correct, then it's gonna look like this one will fall into the pilot error column. The radar altimeter is probably the altimeter referred to in the article, since autoland functions are wired with reference to that. The fact that the Capt's, F/O's and standby altimeters are independent and barometric would let them figure out that the thrust was going to idle way before it was supposed to. They could have intervened sooner and landed normally.<br>  All that they would have needed to do would be to kick off the autothrottle and manually adjust the throttles. <br>  <br>  The reliance on automation in recent years has led to a steep decline in actual pilot skills and the piloting thought process.|`|16a24267160ac4013a8664403db6307daa	No, very few aircraft are eqipped with full auto land sysyem, and even fewer airfields have the equipment to allow its use.<br>  As pointed out in other answer, Only a radio altimeter reading would be even close enough to land with. Radars are very accurate fet remember the ground is there not plus or minus anything.

Domestic vehicles with high miles like that are not good because if something goes bad on this vehicle, it is coming out of your pocket. Even if the miles are ALL highway miles, which is never true.

I get my transmission serviced by a guy who knocks $50 off by paying cash in hand.<br>  <br>  Be aware that if you've driven too long with brakes that need to be replaced, you can damage other parts such as the rotor.

TdrgZwnoaa	I've done this in a Pontiac Sunfire Sedan behind a loaded semi trailer on a deserted stretch of highway.<br>  <br>   You have to be close enough that you cannot see the rear bumper of the truck ( 1 metre is good/stupid ) or you hit turbulence. I did this for about 15 miles one afternoon. Had to back off repeatedly because the car kept overheating in the dead air space behind the truck. I rolled down my window and stuck my hand into the airflow and the airstream was flowing gently from the back to front of my car.<br>   This was attempted at an average speed of approx. 70 MPH. and one could hear every little rattle and squeak in the car because there was virtually no air flow over, under or around the car. The loudest noise was the tires on the pavement and engine RPM dropped by about 300 with an automatic transmission. <br>   I do not recommend this and I certainly would never do it again. I just did it because I was curious at the time. And I was perfectly sober.|`|cyFqjkolaa	You better have one hell of an insurance policy.

6e36b9837420adb6b906ae01a1e722d4aa	That's right.<br>  <br>  Those bikes have a permanent magnet AC Alternator.<br>  If Engine turns,,it makes electricity.<br>  There's no "Field Coil" electromagnet to turn OFF and disable charging out.<br>  <br>  What they do have is "3" charging coils.<br>  1)Actual Charge Coil<br>  2)Lighting Coil<br>  3)Hi-Beam Lighting Coil---(which is actually a dual core coil,,,2 coils but I consider it as 1)<br>  <br>  There is a Rectifier on the Charging Coil>><br>  which converts A/C Output to DC then send That DC Current to Charge the Battery.<br>  <br>  There is NO voltage Regulator whatsoever<br>  <br>  With NO lights on---as in the original Old-style system,,<br>  The Headlight switch Connected the COILS to the lights in order to switch them ON.<br>  <br>  Only the Brake Light was directly Battery Powered<br>  <br>  INSIDE the Light Switch,,,the Hi & Lo Beam Lighting Coils are not only Connected to the Lights,,,,but ADDED to the AC Input side of the Rectifier when the Lights are turned On..<br>  <br>  It's a ODD setup----AC from Alternator goes directly to Head Light,,,,<br>  but it's also branched to ADD AC Current from the light coils to Rectifier,,,,which Boosts DC output a BUNCH<br>  <br>  So without the Bulbs drawing AC Current from the Lighting Coil,,,it all goes to Battery.<br>  <br>  "Only Just" Cooking the Battery is a positive outcome.<br>  It's just as capable of Exploding the Battery under certain conditions.<br>  <br>  .........................................<br>  <br>  So while all that everyone has assured You it's OK to "turn off" the Lights is PERFECTLY TRUE & Right............<br>  <br>  What Matters is HOW you achieve that.<br>  <br>  In Principle the CORRECT way is very simple.<br>  While there's a variety of Wrong ways to it.<br>  <br>  BAD>>> just switch the Ground wire to headlite Off/On.<br>  Sure enough that would operate Headlite Off/On.<br>  But that leaves taillite on,,,AND leaves the Lighting Coils Charging the battery,,,OVERcharging it actually.<br>  .........................................<br>  Here's an attempted "picture" of the circuit<br>  <br>  (Gen Hi-Beam Coil)>>>Switch>>>>>>Hi-Bulb& Other stuff<br>  (Gen Lo-Beam Coil)>>>Switch>>>>>>Lo-Bulb& Other stuff<br>  <br>  That shows the Alternator wired DIRECTLY TO the Switch,,,with nothing branched off in between.<br>  <br>  AFTER and AT the Switch other stuff is connected.<br>  <br>  So you MUST open the Light Charging Circuit BEFORE the Switch.<br>  <br>  Simply Splice your New ON/OFF switch Between the Alternator and the bikes existing HI/LOW Switch.<br>  So that the Hi/Low switch never gets any Power when your New Switch is OFF<br>  <br>  (Gen)>>> (New On/Off)>>>>>(Hi/Lo Switch)>>>>>Bulb<br>  <br>  Simple to See how that controls the Lights as well as kills all power Downstream of your new auxilliary On/Off switch when it's OFF.<br>  And when switched ON,,,bike functions totally as-Normal.<br>  <br>  <br>  The "CATCH" is that since the Gen has Dual Coil/Dual Output for Hi and Lo Beams,,<br>  You must Switch BOTH output wires from alternator to Hi/Lo switch.<br>  <br>  That's a common place where many folks go wrong<br>  <br>  <br>  Use a DPST (Double Pole,Single Throw) Toggle switch.<br>  Double Pole means it's a Pair of Contacts,,,like 2 separate switches side-by-side.<br>  <br>  Single Throw means it's either OFF of ON.<br>  A Common household light switch is one example.<br>  <br>  Hi-Beam---- \....... (Off Position,,,contacts are OPEN)<br>  Lo-Beam---- \......<br>  <br>  <br>  Hi-Beam----x-----(ON Position,,,contacts are CLOSED)<br>  Lo-Beam----x----<br>  <br>  ..........................<br>  Most Switches have 6 Connection lugs.<br>  Long story why,,,but it gives the switch some versatility.<br>  Simplest is the choice of either BOTH Off/BOTH On (All or None)<br>  <br>  Or "A"-On/ "B" Off & "A"-OFF/ "B" ON (Either~Or, always on)<br>  <br>  Ignore the CENTER terminal and use it as All or None>>Both off or Both On.<br>  That is the equivalent of Honda's Early scheme when lights had Off/On switches originally.<br>  <br>  ......................................<br>  Installation---mounting location of the Switch is strictly Your Choice.<br>  You could Drill a hole in Headlite Shell to mount switch Thru,,,<br>  Or make a simple rectangle bracket with a hole for the switch and a hole to mount the bracket to an existing bolt so no permanent changes needed to Bike---a "Bolt On Bracket",,,no holes drilled in bike.<br>  <br>  Or just lash the switch to the handlebars with some duct tape,,,or build a trailer to tow it behind your CT,,,LOL.<br>  However,,Wherever ya wanna put it is strictly up to you.<br>  <br>  Here's what ya DO need to Know.<br>  You'll have 4 Wires at the Switch.<br>  2 FROM the Switch,,,and 2 TO the switch.<br>  <br>  Figure the required Length,,,then Tape them together to make neat sub-harness.<br>  <br>  To Splice them into the Circuit,,<br>  You DO NOT NEED TO CUT any original wires.<br>  <br>  Recall that the Original wires go "DIRECTLY" from alternator to Hi/LO Switch.<br>  Sorta.<br>  <br>  The Alternator has a pigtaill from the "engine" which uses a multi-connector block to the Main Wiring Harness.<br>  <br>  The Harness then goes UP & Forward thru the bike,,,and ends in the Headlite Shell.<br>  <br>  Ok,,,here's where You make your SPLICE---inside the Headlite shell.<br>  <br>  The Harness and the Wires from the Hi-Lo switch Join in Headlight with Plug In Connectors.<br>  <br>  Unplug the PAIR (HI and LOW) so you have "4 loose ends",,,2 males and 2 females.<br>  <br>  Jumper Each Pair with the wires from your New On/Off Switch.<br>  <br>  Each single pair,,,Hi or Low,,,Doesnt matter which way they are connected into the splice.<br>  Meaning,,,each pole set in the switch is NOT polarized.<br>  <br>  Hi Beam wire Colours<br>  --From Harness is WHITE<br>  Then,<br>  From that White to the SWITCH is White & YELLOW.<br>  "2 different colored wires plug together"<br>  <br>  Harness(W)--><----Switch(W/Y)<br>  Pop those loose in the headlite,,,and plug the New switch wires into them.<br>  Done.<br>  <br>  <br>  LOW Beam wire colour<br>  -YELLOW at the Harness<br>  -Yellow from the switch<br>  Unplug them from each other,,,and Reconnect with the Other 2 wires from your New Switch.<br>  <br>  The ON/OFF switch will now totally Isolate the Lighting Coils From from the entire circuit when turned OFF.<br>  It then CANNOT overcharge because they are completely disconnected from Everything.<br>  <br>  When You switch the Lights ON using your new On/Off switch,,,,,the bike reverts to it's Original Function.<br>  Exactly same as Stock operation of all lights,charging,etc.<br>  It doesnt even know the switch is there.<br>  <br>  ------------------------------<br>  You'll need:<br>  1)A DPST Switch,,,(Double Pole-SingleThrow)<br>  --10~15Amp rating is Good,,,,Higher is Better ,,but they become increasingly expensive<br>  <br>  2)WIRE,,,,get "automotive" wire,,,,16 or 18 Gauge is plenty good.<br>  It's Nice to have it Colour Coded,,,but Not Necessary as long as You provide some means of Identification.<br>  ---2 wires can be White for Hi-Beam & 2 wires any Color for Low.<br>  <br>  --Or ALL the wires from the Switch can be SAME color,,,,but Mark one Pair to ID it.<br>  Some Tape,,,or a felt-tip pen .<br>  Make it Easy on yourself,,,anything will do.<br>  .<br>  3) Some crimp-on connectors for your new wires' ends,,,to plug into the "Old Wires".<br>  It's just simpler,neater,,and easiest to Revert/Undo<br>  .........................................<br>  Sorry this has been so long winded<br>  <br>  It's a LOT easier to Do it than to type it,,,or Read it.<br>  <br>  Main theme here is,,,"You Cannot just "DO IT" any sorta way.<br>  <br>  You MUST get the 2 lighting coils OUT of the circuit.<br>  <br>  All-the-Above Bullshit is just saying>><br>  *Unplug the 2 Coils from the Hi/Low Switch,,,,<br>  their connection is Inside the Headlite.<br>  *Jumper those 2 broken connections with a 2 pole switch<br>  <br>  *It's NOT necessary to Cut,Modify,or Damage Anything.<br>  Bike can be returned to Original Condition by merely unplugging and removing switch & reconnecting original wires.<br>  <br>  Hope any of that is understandable.<br>  I struggle to communicate it,,,but honest to goodness it's Very simply to do it Right and Nice.|`|ttbXQEJ8aa	These

AA12261615	the  money and the mileage are both good on that one,that might sound like a lot of miles but its not,i had an 08 in the shop that had well over 60 thousand on it,and it wasn't giving any problems,and for 13 cash you cant go wrong on it,if you decide you don't want to keep it you can always resale it and make your money back on it,check it over good before you buy it and make sure you do a car fax report on this one,good luck.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	Are you kidding!?!? thats a GREAT deal.

QDe5ZyFKaa	Since you've "crashed" twice, the fear may be there for awhile. My mom took the MSF course, fell over once and hasn't ridden since. Good for you for being willing to keep after your dreams! When you have professional instruction, it is not hard to learn to ride a bike safely. <br>  <br>  With an MSF or Harley-Davidson Rider's Edge course, you will start feeling more and more comfortable in about a week. After a month of riding, you'll feel a lot more confident. <br>  <br>  The best bike for you is any bike that lets you put both feet flat on the ground. After taking the class, you should be able to ride anything from 250cc to 1,000cc. Motor size isn't really the issue. You need something with a gentle power curve and low seat height--Harley Sportster or Electraglide, but not a Buell (probably too tall). Honda Shadow. Yamaha Star. Suzuki Boulevard or maybe a GS500F (if you can touch the ground). Check out the Ride Like a Pro videos (link below) to see what small framed women can do on a big touring bike (way cool). <br>  <br>  Safety tips? <br>  <br>  *  Helmet, jacket, boots, gloves. <br>  *  Learn to look where you are going. By watching the vanishing point (the farthest point you can see down the road), you can visually travel back and forth through time and keep yourself safe. <br>  *  You also need to know that bikes turn by "counter steering." To go right, you turn left and the bike falls into a right hand turn. Really. So, to go right, you can either push forward on the right handlebar, or pull backward with the left handlebar. Most experts will teach you to push with the inside hand. This is okay, but when you apply a lot of brakes or panic, you won't be able to push because both your arms will automatically lock out. So, I believe you are better to think of turning as pulling the bike over with your outside arm. This will teach you to unlock your arms and turn even with you are scared silly. Sound hard? After half an hour out on the road you'll see exactly what I mean.<br>  *  Oh, and I highly recommend a bike with a windshield or fairing--they're just SO much more comfortable. <br>  <br>  Recently my wife road my Suzuki Burgman 650 into school. Everyone had a blast teasing her and asking her how cool it was to ride a bike. She took the MSF course and passed her riding test with a 1200 touring bike. You can do this. <br>  <br>  Keep your eyes up and stay safe.|`|botH6rIQaa	Harley Davidson dealers will answer all of your questions,  regardless of your situation,  male or female and give you all the support and encouragement you need.  They will show you all the models and let you decide which one suits you best.  No high pressure sales pitch,  just good information in a relaxing atmosphere.  Go baby,  see you on the road.|`|dNrR8sJGaa	Go to the local Harley dealer and sign up for the motorcycle training class. Its a great class takes a weekend to complete and once you pass the course they give you the documents so you go to the DMV and get your endorsement. Plus you get a discount on your MC insurance for taking the course.|`|Dvx9JquIaa	If you can ride a bicycle, you have the basic skill to ride a motorcycle. If you know how to drive a car with a clutch then you have a second skill.<br>  <br>  Once you start to get comfortable the fear will subside. <br>  <br>  Getting comfortable really depends on how much riding you do when you start. Like anything else, the more practice you get the faster you will feel comfortable.<br>  <br>  Something like a Honda Rebel 250 would be a pretty decent bike to learn on. If you are going to take a course this summer, they will most likely teach you on something no larger than a 250. Once you get through the class you can decide if you want something a little larger. I would say something in the 400cc range wouldn't be bad.<br>  <br>  It is not very hard to learn. If you are taking a course through the MSF they will take you through each step at a very easy pace. The basic MSF class is designed for people that have never ridden before so they will go over everything step by step.<br>  <br>  One of the more imortant issues when dealing with fear is to understand that initially you will feel that you are going very fast even when only going about 30 mph. That is because you are not used to being out in the open as oppsed to being inside of a car.|`|AJmCHSwmaa	First time I rode a bike I remember going like 30mph and thinking wow I really don't like this. It was scary and I couldn't imagine wanting to go any faster or wanting to ride in traffic. <br>  <br>  I think alot of it has to do with the bike. If your on a safe reliable bike, which the first time I rode on it wasn't, you will feel alot safter. Also, if your comfortable on the bike as in not too big, not too much power you will also feel safer. <br>  <br>  You'll get over it you can do it. I will however say that some people never get over that fear and never enjoy riding, that's why you often see a 10 year old bike being sold with like 1,000 miles on it and looking like it just came out of the showroom|`|R4BK9lc6aa	I recommend you take Dept of Public safety Motorcycle education course in your area.  Start with the beginner level, and take the intermediate level too if they offer one.  This will walk you into it, and get you accustomed to the bike and how it works, as well as road safety stuff.  I dont recommend you just jump on and start riding.  I think the best way to learn is to first learn at least the fundamentals about how a motorcycle works, ie. clutch , gas, brakes, and then learn to use them properly.  <br>  <br>  As for what bike, a smaller bike to be sure, I have a real disdain for the Honda Rebel, but thats just my personal taste, but a low seat height such as that will be best.  The courses that you take will allow you to sample the Rebel, they almost always have a few of those, and a other styles, such as enduro bikes.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck, and be safe.|`|Ua2fgdoHaa	Go for it. <br>  <br>  The fear quickly subsides, unless you're like me and crash within two minutes of owning your first bike lol, but even then you'll get over it quickly.<br>  <br>  It took me about a week to feel comfortable with the basics.<br>  <br>  I'm 5'6 and started on a 2008 Ninja 250R, they're nice and pretty quick and you should fit it pretty well.<br>  <br>  Safety tips? Wear gear. Use very little rear brake,<br>  <br>  Motorcycles are just as dangerous as cars, only difference is they're more vulnerable.|`|AA10582974	The easiest way to get over fear is, JUST DO IT.<br>  I'm not saying jump on a bike and ride, that would be irresponsible of me.<br>  Depending on what bike your boyfriend has, if it will accommodate 2 riders, ask him to let you ride it.<br>  Have him sit on the back seat and help you work the controls.<br>  I've taught many girls how to ride that way.<br>  It will help you get over your fear, knowing your boyfriend can take over if you panic.<br>  That's how little kids learn to ride a bicycle.<br>  Their parents help them, until they can do it on their own.|`|rCBRTlGhaa	The fear should go away once you start feeling comfortable on the motorcycle and get a little experience. It is not hard to learn, Many  people have learned and are still enjoying the excitement of riding a motorcycle. The best advice I can offer is while taking the safety course, don't over think your abilities. Just let it happen.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sam - Why the sarcastic advice of mixing alcohol and motorcycles? That is a recipe for becoming a statistic.
c6b895fa8ab23ac2b2739c41d2cb4643aa	"bigger", SUV, and "fuel efficient" don't go together. The only SUV's that are reasonably fuel efficient are smaller ones with 4 cylinder engines. <br>  <br>  it being reliable (or not) is always dicey when you're talking about a car that's going to be older, even Honda's and Toyota's will have problems if they weren't properly cared for. If the 4 cylinder SUV's are too small for you, you won't be getting a fuel efficient vehicle. <br>  <br>  Do you really need an SUV? Or would a car with AWD suffice? If so, consider a Subaru, the Legacy wagon is pretty roomy inside, and more efficient than almost any SUV. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|85ca49f4cb5e82905e646bf35f1e0361aa	After driving Honda's for 20 years, i wanted a crv too, but even Crv's are high priced Used...because of Honda brand.

JwLJq05Iaa	A- Is a camera viewing the exact area of the crash ??<br>  B- If so, would get the from State Department of transportation.  But since no state/country of accident listed, you would have to find contact information yourself.|`|IVjspiStaa	Here's what happened...you were on the cell phone or texting...why do you need a picture of that?
AA11366224	The seat is a temporary device to prevent seated passengers from falling in.  It should be raised when not in use.  Many public lavatories in continental Europe have sprung seats that cannot be left down.<br>  <br>  There is a common misconception among the female gender that the seat should be left down. They should be grateful that a man invented something that provides them with so much comfort. When women invent something, they can make up the rules.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	In an vehicle with a toilet, it would make sense to have the toilet seat behind the steering wheel, so that the driver could use the toilet while continuing to drive.  However, in most vehicles with toilets, the toilet is in the back of the vehicle.  Therefore, to use the toilet, the driver must either park or have someone else drive.<br>  <br>  See - there is a way to interpret the question so that it relates to vehicles.|`|IVjspiStaa	Here is the NEW answer. UP!!! It has always been down, but women pee on them all of the time. I want them to be spring loaded to stay up. So NO ONE PEE's on it.<br>  Every public shared single use rest room is a mess, with papers all over the floor etc. women have to GET the fact that someone would like to use the restroom after them.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	If your a female it has to be kept down. If your a guy who really cares if it's up or down.|`|AA11908567	What has this got to do with cars & transportation?|`|a0b22cb268673a1f7a7236eae4cc3019aa	<br>  You leave it down in case someone sits down without looking they don't fall in.<br>  <br>  Girls don't always look because they never leave it up.<br>  <br>  It also looks cleaner if the bowl isn't perfectly clean.<br>  <br>  Make it a habit because if you leave it up at a girl's house it is rude|`|ywVR8mjyaa	you posh sod, so you have a toilet seat do you.<br>  Better leave it up, that when you don't pi$$ allover it when you're drunk.|`|zruhNGKbaa	It needs to be open so the dog can drink whenever it is thirsty.|`|112df36a825c8dcc63c42fa517f4cb4baa	Remove it altogether. Problem solved!|`|rQFNivhNaa	Down. It stops the dogs drinking out of there!!!!|`|AA11528998	You have a toilet seat in your car<br>  <br>  Wow that's cool<br>  <br>  Check the catagory|`|adTUcnIGaa	Down.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	i always say look before you sit and you wont get your butt wet or worse|`|J1OXz8o9aa	Up, if you're peeing<br>  <br>  if you sit on it, make sure it's down<br>  <br>  If you're not using it, keep closed.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Yes you would, but as it is men who urinate standing up and quite often spray the rim of the toilet bowl with urine, which then touches the seat - you have to ask yourself WHY a woman should touch your urine to put the seat back down.<br>  <br>  Just do it yourself, then it is your urine, and it shouldn't be a problem to you, don't be so un-chivalrous.
0Ou6N6abaa	It would all depend on budget and your experience/skill out of the ones you have listed the ZZR would be the cheapest to buy, run and insure. <br>  <br>  With the other bikes you have listed if its the CBR600f you are thinking about they are great bikes and more forgiving than the race replicas if you are not used to sportbikes, although they still give plenty on thrills and have all the pace you need on the roads. <br>  <br>  I wanted to jump on a race rep when I did my DA test but ended up on a 600 sport/tourer. Spent a year on that and then moved to sports bikes.<br>  <br>  Its probably best to do a whole load of research, search through the mag's/biketrader and MCN to get an idea of the type of bikes.<br>  <br>  Don't feel like you have to jump in the fast lane... I have seen people get onto all sorts of bikes and trash them cause they were not ready to ride the bike they were on, a new rider on a gixer lost control and hit me almost head on, he destroyed my one month old CBR and almost my foot too, so I always advise a 'bit' of caution to new riders. <br>  <br>  Before I start rambling I have to recomend the magazine that I would still refer too when looking for a bike and thats the Used Bike Guide (even if you are buying new) as they give good reviews, spec details and insurance groups on the main selling bikes. I checked out a ton of places including the Used Bike Guide before buying my Ninja, but for a first time rider the main thing may well end up being the insurance costs that decide your first bike.<br>  <br>  I have put a link to the Used Bike Guides online "Bike Buyers Bible" which gives some details but the mag has the up to date info/details.<br>  <br>  Best of luck for your test though.|`|iZypM5jtaa	the gsxr's are comfy to ride on. the cbr is the same way. i like honda performance and reliability but suzukis comfort. NO kawi and no yamaha there uncomfy|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	I'd learn to actually ride if i was you before getting a focused sports bike. Plenty of people do get them, some even go straight for a litre bike and are fine but 3 years down the line they still can't ride for ****. All of the best and fastest riders i ride with did a couple years thrashing the pants off stuff like sv650's, fazers etc Where the limits of their skill slowly came to match the limits of the bike, something you can never do on the road with a full on sportsbike.<br>  <br>  The zzr is a good choice as it's still a quick bike but it's better on the road then the others. Freshen up the suspension, stick some braided hoses and EBC HH pads in all round and a good rider will run rings around a squid on any of the others. <br>  <br>  It all depends whether you want to be a biker or you want to ride a bike. There is a big difference.|`|lYBLEwaWaa	I own a 1998 CBR 600 and it is a fantastic bike You can tour round on it and you can give some of the race reps a bit of a run as well. I have tried to put myself on my ar.se a few times (never on purpose) and the bike has saved me. Shop around for insurance and you will get an affordable quote. Cost of bikes varies depending on condition. If you have around 3 grand you will get a great bike.|`|lsjMmZuiaa	between those you listed, I have a soft spot in my heart for the Honda.  They're just so practical with so little compromise...<br>  <br>  but i'd really suggest looking at the SV650 or EX650-R. the insurance on either should be down with the ZZR, and they're all you need for the street.<br>  <br>  the 600cc class has become saturated with true "race replica" bikes - they're just not made to do WELL on the street, they're de-tuned just enough to be TOLERABLE on the street.|`|AA12099537	I bought a '99 CBR600F as my first bike after passing my test last year - No regrets! It's fast, comfortable looks good and is easier to ride than the GS500 i took my test on.<br>  <br>  Paid about ￡2k and insured it TPF&T for ￡140. Just renewed with one year no claims bonus at ￡84.<br>  <br>  The CBR will hold its value aswell.|`|74zKhLxQaa	Id say go for the VFR (nc30) RVF (nc35) 400cc .. awesome bikes, good to ride, look amazing, can keep up with a 600cc if you no how to ride it.. and will be cheaper on the insurance. <br>  <br>  might be a tad more expensive .. but def worth the money.|`|fVDEWVgQaa	Good Luck with your direct access. <br>  The main point you don't mention is your budget. X6R, CBR and GSXR's will be expensive to insure and also to buy. The ZZR600 is a bigger, heavier bike and is something I looked at (I did my DAS last November)<br>  My First Choice was a CBR600F around a 1998 but this broke my rather small budget. <br>  I eventually settled for a 1995 Suzuki GSF600 Bandit, Paid ￡500 for it. It's good for 130mph and is a smooth ride. Insurance is costing me ￡29 per month with Kwikfit. <br>  You say you are after something sporty, Personally i would stay away from the Gixxers they are far too common now, personally I would be looking at Triumph as an alternative or go for the CBR600F.|`|AA12200264	Of the choice you've given i'd go for CBR600 simply because they are a more forgiving bike to ride, cheap to run, rarely go wrong and hold it's value better than the rest. Also, if you're an all weather rider then they survive the elements better.|`|3LaC2VFUaa	Why not stray slightly from your choices and try out the Honda Hornet 600. They are built around a '98 CBR engine so they have all the same power and are cheaper to insure and have more comfort. I drive one and find it a fabulous bike. Just another option for you.
muPiBQ3Uaa	The one with the wrench is the maintenance lamp.<br>  <br>  The one of the outline of the engine is the new equivalent of the "Check Engine" or "Service Engine Soon" lamp. You need to have it scanned to find out why it is on; do NOT ignore it.|`|CkTJiBEXaa	Means something is wrong go to a shop and get it fixed.|`|LgYCslyVaa	1st of all you should definitely not wait on oil changes. Oil is the lifeline of your engine.  Check engine light means your cars computer has thrown a code and on such a new car it could be for hundreds of things. You need to go to a shop and have a OBD2 (On Board Diagnostic) Scanner put on the car to find out on what the problem is. It could be anything from a bad oxygen sensor to actually engine trouble. Go get that checked!!
FDeoPn89aa	Mileage depends a lot on how you ride. <br>  <br>  I think that Kawasaki claims that you get about 75mpg on those bikes. I think 60 is more realistic. If you ride very aggressively, it could be as low as 40.<br>  <br>  I think MSRP on a new one should be around $4000.00. Typically you have to add taxes and dealer prep to that, so you might wind up writing a check for 5K or more.<br>  <br>  If you're looking at used bikes, its going to depend a lot on the year. Post 2007, Kawa made some radical and popular changes to the 250's. Since then, demand for those bikes has been very strong, and they're hard to find (expect to pay close to new prices). 2007 or earlier should be a lot cheaper.|`|lsjMmZuiaa	the EX250 should get between 55 and 65 mpg consistently, and realistically during a reasonable mix of city and highway riding.<br>  <br>  You'll see people say 70mpg, but that's just not practical.  Sure, it's possible if you go 55mph in 6th gear on a dead flat (or down hill) road, tucked onto the tank like you're racing, but "around 60" is going to be much more common.<br>  <br>  $4,000 from a dealer is the "new" cost - but a lot depends on demand in your area.  at their 2008 introduction, I heard of them going for over $7k new. ridiculous, but true. <br>  <br>  do yourself a favor and buy used.  Low mileage examples can be found for $2,000 or less.  most people don't intend to stay on the 250 forever, so there's a lot of them for sale.
fl60KL8oaa	If she is looking toward the 600RR the logical start would be the smallest sportbike, the Kawasaki 250R, aka the Baby Ninja.|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	I think the Honda would be the best choice,(wife has one also) It is light weight, easy for her to handle, and very dependable. <br>  Great starter bike.|`|AA10768351	My son rides on a Hyosung 250.  It's based in a Suzuki style frame (Hyosung used to make engines for Suzuki) and is a "full size" bike.  It's been a nice bike and the price was way lower then the Kawi.  <br>  <br>  I ride a CBR and would definitely recommend it when she's ready to move up!|`|jFwuiRKxaa	THe Hyosung is a great choice and if it matters it will own the ninja250r and cost less and is just as reliable. Hyosung is not a chinese import. A 250 honda rebel is a loser no matter  how  you compare motorcycles|`|miyAb7cQaa	Ninja 250R.|`|ZcMqiFDNaa	get her a real bike
AA11260610	well you'd have to give more details...<br>  How many miles was it taken care of or not?<br>  did you do a carfax report on both cars...<br>  <br>  knowing only what you've stated then my only suggestion is...<br>  Caddy parts generally cost more so the Tahoe would be a tad bit cheaper in the long run|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	07 Tahoe.<br>  <br>  The Tahoe is the same car as the 2007 Caddy Escalade.<br>  <br>  Only differences are that the Escalade is more expensive because it wears the Cadillac name and has more luxurious features standard.<br>  <br>  Tahoe is newer, and better.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	07 Tahoe.|`|nfua6A4paa	these people are funny if you owned a tahoe or a esclade you would think diffrently...chevy tahoe and  cadillac escalade are the same suv... if you take an 03 tahoe and a 03 escalade and take off the body you will see the drivetrain and chassy are exactly the same... they use the same parts.. only diff is the body and interior option..... but the engine is the same vortec 5.3l or 6.0l....i have an 03 tahoe with a 5.3l and it hauls ***..rides better than an expedition and cheaper than toyota sequoia.<br>  i bout mine new in 03 and the only problem i had was a faulty speaker and they replaced while i had the warranty... gas mileage isnt bad... but you already know what you are getting into when looking to buy a suv...if you want to save 10-15k and dont mine getiing 17-18 per gallon go with an escalade but if you want efficiancy and  spending a bit more than go with the tahoe!|`|QnxvlOqMaa	They both suck, and guzzle gas don't get either.  Gas may be cheap now but it WILL get expensive again, and you will wish you didn't have a SUV. But if you're really determined to get one i'd look at the mileage and the cost of each, features etc. Just going by the model year doesn't tell us much.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	I agree with bigbadwolf. More information would yield a much better answer for you. Just on the info you have provided, Newer is better. Go with the tahoe.|`|MIyuDtc0aa	Neither.  They are obnoxious and bad for the environment.  Buy something with better gas mileage or at least buy the hybrid version.|`|68d4d4f4566a20affea781e7789c9a94aa	07 Tahoe!!! You are more likely to have problems with the 03 escalade.
r1D9P4Vyaa	Have that clunk looked at, and as far as the floating, it could be as simple as low tire pressure. That will give you a tire roll and the car will fell floaty, not stable.<br>  Also look at he tire wear for how is the alignment. You may want to have a 4-wheel alignment done also.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	Could be tie rod end. or control arm. You might want to get it looked at ASAP, you can run the risk of literally having the wheel fall off while your driving. technically it should be towed.|`|ckfFD9Icaa	i have a '96 caddilac sls, i have a similar prob, my rear suspension has been worn.  sometimes it wabbles in the rear sorta fishtailing when i go over 60mph.  but rather than pay 2k to fix it i just dont speed too often.  <br>  <br>  the wheels wont come off its just suspension and when i hit  abump it squeaks but its no biggy, ya just gotta learn how to caddy roll.<br>  <br>  ive driven with this shity suspension for over 2 yrs, no probs.
cx6YwezWaa	Risky But Should Make It, My Westcoast Done 180 Miles With Same Probs. ;)
IZE6QaSnaa	What does "dose" mean?  By the way, your "Caps Lock" key is stuck.|`|xnsoQzInaa	The closest place to go legally is Tug Hill NY. You must have it registered and there are tons of great trails to ride. Its a little bit of a trip from the city but its a awesome place to go for a short weekend trip.
EnaCCMQJaa	Take no notice about the ignition system being 'more powerful', your source is talking out of his backside. Have the engine set up properly i.e 'Crypton' tuned as the mixture will be far too rich - black smoke & sooty deposits on plugs, excessive fuel consumption etc|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it could be the 02 sensor. i know when i had a bad 02 sensor on my oldsmobile it made the plugs black. it also could be the choke sticking too letting it load up and causing black smoke. check the choke and the pull-off to see if the pull-off is opening the choke part way open and make sure the choke flap is wide open when it,s warmed up.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	the black film on every thing tells me that you have a rich running situation, too much fuel and not enough air. the ignition system has very little to do with this. as a matter  of fact. if you do not feel a miss than the ignition system is doing its part. i am curious how you chance a engine chamber. perhaps we have a mis-communication. if you replaced the heads and the combustion chamber is part of that then ok that i understand.   if you replaced the block, and the cylinders are a part of that, once again i see what you are saying , but out of that range, i am at a loss.
zruhNGKbaa	With a good set of Aggressive slightly over sized  ( increase 10 points on the P2XX number over the factory size specified on the door jamb ) tires that baby has absolutely everything you need to hit the trails except a winch.<br>  <br>  As long as the engine, transmission and transfer case and lock out hubs are all working correctly the Wrangler is one of the top 5 off road vehicles ever built - right out of the box.  <br>  <br>  Other than a winch, any "Upgrades" you may choose to do are more window dressing  than anything which will seriously improve it's off road performance unless you want to spend some serious dough to build it with off road racing components.|`|asEV10aXaa	First upgrade would be a little more agressive tire or a light bar<br>  my wrangler is red and I got neoprene red and black seat covers, they look badass<br>  After than here are some suggestions to save up for<br>  <br>  - lift kit ( I would suggest a 4-6 inch suspension lift and 1 inch body lift)<br>  - Mud tires (33-35 if u have 4in. suspension lift + body lift, 38's if you have 6 inch suspension lift + body lift) <br>  -wagon wheels for the mud tires (get black)<br>  -then you want a step <br>  - a winch<br>  -fog lights<br>  -  Lockers or you could do an axle swap to the dana 44 because it has air lockers<br>  -snorkel <br>  - and eventually a long arm rock crawling kit (only if you are seriously into offroading)<br>  <br>  that's pretty much everything I'm planning on doing to my 2000 wrangler but everything costs so much and I work at Dairy Queen so I'm not making much money lol|`|b13e67e09be2c5a888d65427678b9383aa	If you just bought it change the oil and the diff luid in the axles,  then you can buy a nice suspension lift i would about a 3" and stick with some 32's or 33's and it would look great, stay witht he 3" lift and you wont have to buy new control amrs, or new driveshafts and alot of problems start happening dont go above a 35" tire because the axles in the wrangler are not the best you have a dana 35 axle in the rear which is one of the worst axles ever built, your front dana 30 is better than the 35.   Look for some jeep forums and look at their jeeps for some ideas.  Try www.jeepsunlimited.com<br>  <br>  <br>  or www.wranglerforum.com   there are tons of forums out there for jeeps

BytY1eL1aa	Well, you need money (Obviously), an insurance agency, and a titling agency.  I'd say, when you test it out, you NEED to get it taken to your family mechanic to check it out to see if it's got any problems.  If it's a dealership, they'll say ANYTHING just go get some commission.  If it's an independent seller and they claim to have taken it to their mechanic, I wouldn't hold that as credible.  Ask to test it, take it to your most trusted mechanic like I mentioned before, get him/her to check it.  If they sign off on it, then you might have a good investment in the works.  If not, well, that's self explanatory.  If you do buy it, don't forget to haggle like crazy.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	All states are different but most require a clean Title, or B.O.S<br>       signed in the right place ( that's important ).<br>  <br>       It's always good to have a separate piece of paper that states<br>       The Seller name and Signature is selling my (Name of Car )<br>       to ( Your Name ) on such (Date ) for XXX amount of dollars.<br>       as is.  <br>  <br>       This is always good to have.

b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	A jet engine has the following steps:<br>  <br>  1) Intake of air 2) Compression, where the air is compressed 3) Ignition, release of chemical energy into the compressed air 4) expansion, release of the hot air into the atmosphere at high velocity and thus generating the thrust. Now if you dump more fuel into the expansion stage, it further increases the energy and hence the thrust. This process is called afterburning.<br>  <br>  As the name suggests, it is burning after the regular jet cycles.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Its an extension on the end of a jet engine where fuel can be burnt to increase thrust. It does not have compressor blades like the engine itself, and so it has very little compression of the air, so it is very inefficient. <br>  Its meant to give a jet an extra boost of power when it really needs it, but without having to install a larger, more expensive engine.|`|628354eb8f7435b3ae5db56f6ecf4b14aa	it is a bypass valve that dumps raw fuel into the post combustion jet stream creating a large boost in speed at the expense of a super high rate of fuel consumption|`|L1cBV8qQaa	redirects where the fuel goes... this causes flames that come out of aircraft|`|evnZABsSaa	An afterburner (or reheat) is an additional component added to some jet engines, primarily those on military supersonic aircraft. Its purpose is to provide a temporary increase in thrust, both for supersonic flight and for takeoff (as the high wing loading typical of supersonic aircraft designs means that take-off speed is very high). On military aircraft the extra thrust is also useful for combat situations. This is achieved by injecting additional fuel into the jet pipe downstream of (i.e. after) the turbine. The advantage of afterburning is significantly increased thrust; the disadvantage is its very high fuel consumption and inefficiency, though this is often regarded as acceptable for the short periods during which it is usually used.<br>  <br>  Jet engines are referred to as operating wet when afterburning is being used and dry when the engine is used without afterburning.[1] An engine producing maximum thrust wet is at maximum power (this is the maximum power the engine can produce); an engine producing maximum thrust dry is at military power.|`|KhyPqoFIaa	Hello there <br>  <br>  The afterburner is a device meant to inject extra fuel and provide extra speed to a jet<br>  <br>  It′s the turbo speed, too bad it′s only for short periods of time because it does consume large percentage of fuel!|`|GB5U7uPraa	Good answers.  BTW, the Brits call it "reheat".|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The afterburner is a feature that sprays fuel directly into the exhaust of a jet engine, where it burns and produces a huge amount of additional thrust (along with a huge amount of noise and an impressive flame).  It usually also consumes a great deal of fuel. It is useful for going very fast and for exceeding the speed of sound.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	It is the part of some turboramjet engines, aft of the turbines, where fuel is injected and burned.

As for it adding value to your car I don't think it will.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	I'd mention it.  You've saved the next buyer the expense of paying for the rebuild.  The warranty is also a big plus if it's transferrable to the next owner.<br>  <br>  As far as what value it "adds" to the car, that depends on how you look at it.  Your car probably isn't worth a whole lot more than a similar 2002 Neon with the original trans still functioning properly.  That being said, your Neon is worth a lot more now with a fully functioning rebuilt trans than it would be worth with a broken down original transmission - probably about as much more as what you paid to have it rebuilt.
