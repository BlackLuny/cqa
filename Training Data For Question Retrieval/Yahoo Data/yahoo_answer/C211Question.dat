20090309232430AAUCvrd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	What do the judges look at?	I am getting ready to take my oldest daughters father to court for child support. And I was wondering what I would have to prove or show to the judge to prove the father unfit to have visitations.   He has been in and out of jail for drug use and spent time for stabbing my husband a few years ago. I have had 2 protection orders on him but the courts dropped the last one after he got out of jail for the stabbing. Unsure why though. He was given supervised visits with her when she was 8 months old but refused to show up for them.      I am trying to find out if these things will be enough to make sure he doesn't get rights to visitations with her. (He has not seen my daughter since she was 8 months old and she will be 8 years old in Aug) And she is deal thy afraid of her father due to the threats and things he has done in the past to us.
20090309232812AAzO5yi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Need some help with going from being a full time working mom to part time working mom...?	Well I have a 21 month old son and I am currently 10 weeks pregnant with my second child. I work nights from 8:00 pm - 4:30 am. I get MAYBE 4 hours of sleep a day. And thats only in pieces. I get about 2 hours after I get home and finally fall asleep and then maybe another 2 when my son takes a nap. This schedule and lack of sleep on top of being pregnant and sick is absolutely killing me! My hubby works full time during the day and I work at night because we can't afford daycare and we don't want our son in it. I really want to switch to working part time. Probably two 10 hour days on the weekend nights. I have gone over all over our bills and as long as I downgrade the cable, the cell phone, get rid of the internet, and conserve more of electricity and spenidng on things like eating out and shopping I think we can make it fine. We will have to cut back on going out and doing things but we are fine with that. I just can't go on with this schedule. I am literally ready to fall over and just call it quits! I am nervous about asking my manager for fear that she may say no. I was thinking of asking my Dr. to give me some kind of recommendation to switch to part time because this schedule just isn't healthy for me. Do you think a Dr. would do this? Does anyone have any tips on how to save more money on bills? I would like to get rid of my hubby's car but we would be way in the whole on that one. I just need some advice and sugestions. Do you think it is plausible? I currently make 12.52 per hour. Plus another 1.50 on top of that for night differential. And if I work on the weekends at night i would make another 1.50 on top of that an hour for weekend differential. That would put me at about 15.52 an hour. I think just my portion of the bills will still cost me around $1000 per month. So what do you think? I need advice and encouragement! This is a big step and a big change. I am really scared.

I am so lost and confused and could use some guidance--   I am now on CD 40 and 16 DPO, and AF is 9 days late!   I got 2 postiive preggo tests at 10 DPO, one BFN at 12 DPO, and another faint BFP at 13 DPO.    I went today for a checkup and he did another urine test (pregnancy) and it came back BFN!!!!!!!   He said it looks like the baby had died and he prescribed me some pills that he said "will flush my system, press reset on my body, and ill start my period and I could try again next month"   But I have had no cramping, no spotting, no bleeding! NOTHING!   I have a blood test scheduled for in the morning, even if its neg i hear that some people didnt get BFP until there period was 3 weeks late or later!!   Is there still a chance I am still pregnant as long as I dont bleed, or the baby is still alive? I am having the worst time but trying not to stress so much so that I dont miscarry.   Anything bit of information will be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much! :)

20090309232952AA0EAcH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My period is late 4 days already, am i pregnant?	Last time i had my period was on feb. 9, i was supposted to start on Mar. 6. Now it is almost march 10. I am having some cramps but only for a few minutes and it goes away. I have had intercourse on march 4th. right about when i was supposted to start. i also had intercourse 1 or 2 weeks before that. (without protection, but my bf did not ejaculate inside of me).       one important thing that is happening to me is that i have been going to the chiropractor for a week now for my herniated disc in my lower spine. i believe because of the movement of my pelvic bone, this might be the reason why my period is late. but i am still scared i am pregnant. i have taken 2 pregnancy tests 2 days ago and both came out negative.      and please can somebody suggest to me what i should do if i am pregnant, because i am going to need an abortion. should i get an abortion pill or get the surgery and is there any free abortion clinics? thank you so much for those who answer

I have a two month old and since she was born I made it clear to my mother and fiance NOT to smoke in the house. This morning my fiance told me to look by our computer in the living room and BAMM there was a ashtray with TWO cigarette butts and ashes. I asked her did she smoke in the house, she said NO she just put the cigarette butts in the ashtray after she was finished smoking outside [which she was lying]. I feel disrespected and I need to confront her again. It wouldn't bother me so much if I was staying with her - but she's staying with us because she's getting a divorce -until she finds a place of her own.

20090225091706AAMdIiB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Does my baby have a virus?	She's 5 months old and has had a bad cough and a running nose, but no other symptoms, for about a month. I took her to the doctor twice and he said it was just a regular cold. Day before yesterday (23rd) she had diarrhea about four times in one day. It wasn't pure water but it was very runny. Yesterday, she threw up while with my mom who said it happened at the end of a coughing spell. Then, she threw up again at the doctor's office (but it was when he put the popcicle stick thing down her throat) Then last night, she had diarrhea and when I was changing her, she started gagging and gasping for breath. When I sat her up, she threw up some milk. Then she had diarrhea a few hours later. She felt really warm in the night, but I couldn't find her thermometer and will buy a new one today. She's really happy all the time and doesn't cry before or after she throws up. She doesn't act like her tummy hurts. Does she have a virus or is something else wrong?

I've only been on the pill for about 3 months and I stopped taking it last month.  Before taking the pill and while I was on it, my period was extremely consistent as a 28 day cycle.  The first day of my last period was Jan 29, which would have given me an expected start this month of today but so far I do not feel at all like I will get it.  I've been pregnant before and have one child... for some reason, I feel like I could be pregnant but I don't know if it's my imagination or what.  I took a home preg test and it was negative this morning but I feel nauseous, have been getting heartburn for 2 days (which I never ever get) and just have this content, calm feeling that I had when I was pregnant before.  Is it possible that stopping the pill changed my cycle or do you think that it could have been a false negative?  I didn't have many early symptoms with my first pregnancy.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.

20090225092510AA33vM3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Paternity question, please help?	Hey. I did a really stupid thing a while ago. Im married but I had a one night stand with another guy and I ended up pregnant. Plz don't judge me, I already feel like a horrible person, and I feel so guilty. Im so scared, cuz I really want this baby to be my husbands, I love him so much. I know I need to take a paternity test once the babies born, but thats still months away, and it kills me not knowing. I was wondering if anyone could tell me the chances that it could be my husbands. During the week ovulation occured, we had sex almost every day, and I had the sex with the the other guy one time. I know it only takes one time, but since my husband and I were having sex alot more, would that make him more probable to be the father. Also, the doctor told me I conceived sometime within a five day span. The day I had sex with the other guy is a day after the doctors estimate. For example. The doctor said I conceived days 3-7 and I had sex with the other guy on day 8. I was wondering why the doctor wouldn't include day eight as well, because day eight was the 14th day of my cycle. Wouldn't he think I would ovulate on that day? How do doctors figure out the estimated conception? Thanks for your time. Sorry its long.

He got evicted from his last apartment dand so we took him in temporarily until he got his life back together. He's been here almost a year now and I am going insane. I need him OUT. He didn't pay us rent for the longest time because he had no job. He doesnt clean up after himself, doesnt have respect for me, my daughter or Josh. He stays up all night and I have to go wake him up in the morning to get him to go to work. I stay home all day and take care of my daughter while Josh works.       Anyways, today Ken comes up to me and says so if my work calls tell them I am sick again. WTF? are you kidding me! He was just off on Monday and its only Wednesday!!! He is a lazy little creep and its gettig on my nerves. We want him to save money so that he can get the heck out of here. We gave him a dead line where he knows he has to leave, he will be 20 in May so thats his dead line to get his own place. I swear, just last year he had like 20 jobs all of which he got fired from.       And we cant kick him out because he would literally be on the streets. and my boyfriend Josh loves his brother very much but i dont think he realizes how much his brother drives me nuts!! what would you do? any advice?

I watch this 19 month old for a friend, Problem is.. she has babied him so much to the point where if he even so much as wimpers she grabs him and rocks him, She breastfeeds all sorts of times in the day and not that I am against that this gilr hasnt introduced him to a bottle for when she is gone, I mean Breastfeeding is your own choice but this is bad, He wont even hold his own sippy cuyp and he knows how to.. all he ever says is MAMA while screaming and kicking at the door.. he can go for 3 hours.. I try everything and my will is running dry I have a toddler of my own and cant do this with him all day.. I try everything but the money just isnt worth this.. he is horrible. My daughter also needs attention and she acts like its just no big deal that he SCREAMS for HOURS.  He is just so bad and Some days he will be okay but then she doesnt bring him over the weekend and he just goes right back to it.. so she drops him off at 7 and he wakes up my gilr with his yelling and then she is yelling and its only because he wont stop.. shes always happy and tries to play he wont play.. he is totally unsocialized and I am just in awe. I personally dont think it was a good idea to NOT SOCIALIZE her baby AT ALL. I mean her husband is divorcing her because she sleeps with her baby in betwwen them and hasnt slept with him for 8 months.

20090225054335AADvO4m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Until my 6 week sonogram and checkup how do I know everything is ok with my baby?	Until my 6 week sonogram and checkup how do I know everything is ok with my baby? I am 4 weeks and a few days pregnant confirmed by a blood test last Monday. The nurse called and said my progesterone was great at 28 and that my hcg level was a 106 and I am very early about 4 weeks pregnant. I have my 6 week checkup March 9th. The nurse said I shouldn't need anymore bloodwork but to call if something should happen like i start spotting or bleeding or cramping! I am SO nervous and scared although optomistic that my baby will be healthy. I am trying to remain optomistic. So how do I know in the meantime that everything really is ok? Thanks for all your help. I had a miscarriage 1 time before (the only other pregnancy before this one) and it was very early chemical pregnancy due to low progesterone. Thanks soooo much!!
20090225094227AACR5WD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How To Deal With A Toddler's Irrational Fears....?	My daughter is going to be one in two weeks (how did that happen?) and just this past week, she has developed an intense, irrational (to me anyways) fear of the vacuum cleaner.  Even if it's not turned on, if she sees it she bolts in the opposite direction, shakes, screams and cries.  I asked her father if he knew of anything that could have caused this and he did admit that he was vacuuming the floor once and he bumped her toes when she crawled in front of it, she had no reaction that time and a few times afterward, and then this!  How can I help her to get used to it and not totally freak out every time it's out if she doesn't even like the sight of it?

Even if they don't stay fresh it's not like I'm screwed just throw them away and then we couldn't use them I'm out a while 5.00. What do you think will they stay fresh if frozen.
20090225091152AAB84iE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How big of servings do you feed your toddler?	Just curious about mealtime.  I sometimes feel like I am not giving my kids enough food, but if I make them more, they don't usually eat it.  They only eat the amount I would normally give them.  Here is what I do currently:      Snack things I do give them a full adult serving usually.  Like they will eat a whole banana instead of a half.  They eat a full yogurt (6 oz).  They eat an adult recommended serving of green beans (1/2 cup).  But at meal time I find myself giving them 1/2 an adult serving, like for spaghetti and meat and stuff.  Like if they are having chicken nuggets and 6 is the recommended, I give them 3 each.  They eat rice with one meal a day and they get almost 1/2 a cup each (I make 3/4 cup uncooked, and divide it in half for them).  They eat a full piece of toast each with peanut butter for breakfast, along with cheerios and yogurt or fruit.        So I am just curious how old your toddler is, and how big of servings you give them.  I guess my average "mealtime" serving for them is 1/2 an adult.  My boy will be 3 on April 29 and my girl will be 2 on May 3.  My son is 39 inches 35 pounds and my daughter is about 33-34 inches  and about 25 pounds, so I think they are growing just fine.  I just have a hard time judging because I know what I feed them wouldn't fill me up!  But they don't act hungry, and I know they are smaller than me!
20090225081828AA34CAN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What and when does your baby/toddler drink?	My daughter is 17 months and drinks only water.  She has a fresh cup of water available all day so she can drink whenever she is thirsty.  I was speaking to some mums at a baby group, and they give their children of similar ages all sorts - never water (boring, apparently), but rather juice, ribena, fizzy drinks, milkshakes etc. and they only give drinks with a meal or snack.  They say that I am doing wrong by only giving her water (she loves it and shows no interest in other drinks, so I don't see the point in encouraging her to drink things that will rot her teeth!) and by allowing her to have it whenever she wants it.  They say drinks should only be with meals/snacks or it teaches baby/toddler to 'graze' over food and drink, and not to eat/drink properly.  What do you think?  When and what does your baby/toddler drink?

20061213092318AAA2uTF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	When Is The Best Time To Have Sex After A Miscarriage!!!!?	I had a miscarriage on the 4th. It did not end in a D&C. I was only 6 weeks so my body pushed the baby out naturally that day. I stopped bleeding about 4-5 days ago. I feel fine and I havnt been in any pain since the day of my miscarriage. The Dr. at the E.R. said that I couldnt have sex for 6 weeks! On the other hand I have read that as soon as you stop bleeding it is okay and that is for woman who had had a d&c which is more dangerous than having a natural miscarriage. Also, the Dr. said that we couldnt try to get pregnant again for at least 3 months. I have read that as soon as you are able to have sex or you can wait a cycle it is safe because you are more fertile and more likely to get pregnant within three months following the miscarraige. What should we do???

I see the directions suggests giving 2-3 tablets at one time and states you can give 2 tablets every hour for up to 6 doses! That's 12 tablets in 6 hours! I have read on their website (if I understood it correctly) that even if the baby were to take the whole bottle, there would be no harm since it's an all-natural combination of ingredients. Still, some herbs can be dangerous to people even in small doses so it kind of scares me.      I've started using Hyland's in the last few days. I'm wondering what other mommies feel the maximum number of tablets should be in one day. I've consulted with my pediatrician on this but he tends to be wayyyyyy conservative on everything. I'm just exploring to see what others think.      Thanks!

20090225085819AAy9ZWV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Worried- If you had implantation bleeding.....?	I got my period twice this month, I got it on 2.14 & it was gone by 2.19 I had normal old blood spotting after, then it cleared up completely. I check my cervix & everything was "clean" up there. Then the morning of 2.22 I woke up to light pink spotting on the tp. Throughout the day it got a little heavier, it went from light pink to brownish red to red then back to just spotting.I had sex that night & I started bleeding lightly for 5 min then nothing. The next morning there was nothing on my underwear then when i went pee there was light pink again. Today it seems like the pinkish, brownish red. is gone and i'm only having brown CM so far and maybe a dot of pink. What could this be? I cld a pregnancy hot line and they told me that they see many ppl that get pregnant on there period, so my question is, does this sound like implantation bleeding? If you have had implantation bleeding when did you get your next pregnancy symptoms

20090225081613AAe4n9u	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Four year old wetting the bed?	I have a four year old step daughter you has recently started wetting the bed when she is over at our house.  She has never done this before.  She was potty trained very early and never had a problem not making it to the bathroom.  However, recently she has started wetting the bed in the early hours of the morning before we wake up.  She does not live with us 24/7 so we asked her mom (who has custody) if she had been doing this at her house and she confirmed that she had done it a couple of times over there, but that it was "no big deal".       This seems like a big deal to me. Any advice on this is greatly appreciated. Is there anything I can do to prevent this from continuing?
20090225082847AADQsJj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pre *** and Day After Pill? What are pregnancy chances.?	Wow. I write at age 23 with extreme nervousness and scared. On Feb 23 my girlfriend and I had sex for the first time together but the condom ripped midway through the intercourse. I pulled out as soon as I realized.  We quickly went to the pharmacy to get the day after pill.  She must have taken the pill no more than 2 hours after discovering the condom was broken.   She is not on the birth control pill and I did not ejaculate but there had to be precum.  She started her period on the Feb 14th. I am so scared even though I've heard chances are low. I just know I will learn from this scare and hopefully it just turns out to be a scare.   Any thoughts about this???

20090225091029AAxpSDq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Disconnection between a mom and her daughter?	This is kind of long, but the situation means a lot to me.  My niece is 18 months old, her mom being my sister. My sister, brother in law and my niece all live with us because he lost his job.  They now both have jobs but are staying until they are financially stable again. My sister does not bond with my niece at all and it is not due to postpartum depression. It very hard to see this day after day. Here is an example of a day for my niece: wakes up at 7:00 am, her dad puts her in her high chair in front of the tv while she eats breakfast, either made by myself or her dad. Her mom wakes up at 7:10 and takes a shower (does not see her).  Once my sister is out of the shower she takes her daughter to the babysitter at 7:30 (the time the babysitter allows the kids to come over), my sister then comes back home and gets ready for work. Either myself or the baby's grandma picks her up at 4:30, makes her dinner and plays with her.Then she goes to bed at 7:00pm.  My sister gets home and is with her maybe 45 minutes and then puts her to bed, sometimes we have to put her to bed. She never sees her! Even on the weekends they drag her along for miscellaneous errands, just because my sister wants to get out of the house.  On Sunday's they go to family brunch... how enjoyable is that for a 18 month old? I would imagine she would want to play and not sit in a highchair. When my sister and brother in law have a day off due to holidays they still drop the baby at the sitter. I'm appalled. I can't imagine having a day off without my child.  Between "after work activites" that my sister and brother in law have to do during the week, I would say they see the baby at most 6 hours during Mon-Fri. They see her during the weekends but in a car seat or stroller!!  If I was her I would be getting up early to get ready so when my daughter wakes up I could spend sometime with her.  I work full time and am in college and I manage to see her more.  What my question is, is there something wrong here? What can I do to make my sister realize that this is not normal without stepping my boundaries as an aunt? Both my sister and brother in law are college educated and were not brought up this way. PLEASE HELP!

The reason I ask is because I'm 37 weeks and I've been having constant contractions since Sunday every 2-3 minutes. I was sent home from the hospital 3 times because nothing is changing with my cervix. This morning when I woke up I noticed that my panties were a little wet and there was a line of fluid from the middle of my panties to the back. I was laying on my back. I took a shower and I still feel a lot of wetness down there but not a flow. Will my contractions get stronger

20070420190028AAv17Wf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I still be pregnant even though a pregnancy blood test came back negative?	I have been throwing up for the past 4-5 days and I've been sleeping at least 14 hours a day because I feel exhausted all of a sudden. I only throw up around noon to 3pm. My breasts are starting to hurt. My period is still a week away but my parents insisted on me seeing a doctor right away because of my constant vomitting. The doctor said I appear to be fine, everything seemed normal so he gave me a blood pregnancy test but it came back normal. Is it possible I may be pregnant but it's too soon to tell? Or could I just have the flu? Even though I feel fine, no stomach ache, no headache, no coughing...nothing...just throwing up and feeling tired.
20070413184424AAGGppq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Babies 1st tooth?	My daughter is 5 1/2 months old and cut her 1st bottom tooth on April 1st. During the last 3 days she has vomitted twice, had loose stools, fevers of around 99 to 100 on and off, and has been constantly irritibility. I love my baby but I'm going nuts. The screaming, biting and moodiness is heartbreaking.  I have tried everything and little relieves her pain. I've tried tylenol, teething rings, wet washcloth, frozen rings, teething pills,orajel and tonight I gave her a dose of Ibuprofen. Is her 2nd tooth coming in or is all this pain related to the 1st tooth she already cut? Also how long does it take for the 2nd bottom tooth to follow the first?

She is staying completely dry even at night. The problem we have is she wakes up several times a night to use the bathroom and stands in the bathroom crying until we come help her.  We try to encourage her to pull her own pj down and get on the toilet but she just cries and asks for help. We have installed night lights and leave the bathroom light on. We also have her potty seat and step stool in place to make it as easy as possible. She calls out for us to come help and cries until everyone in the house is awake.

20070303043038AAopS1A	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Pregnancy symptoms w/ negative tests?	Hello all.  I am going crazy!  I am currently 7 days late for my period.  I have to date taken 3 tests, all negative.  I took the first two before I was a week late so kinda expected they would be negative.  I just took the 3rd this morning on the 7th day.  I have had many symptoms throughout the last week and a half.  I am extremely tired, eating like it's going out of style, tender/tingling breasts, bloating with some back pain.  I also felt cramping as if I was going to start the first few days I was due but nothing has happened.  I've also experience some clear watery discharge.  I have a four year old and didn't test until I was two weeks late with her.  I've had 2 miscarriages but both times was able to get a positive result around a week late.  Could I still be pregnant or just assume that I've missed a period.  I am trying not to psych myself up or out about the possiblity of being pregnant.  Any advice would be appreciated!

20090227101159AAhv6nj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	OH MY GOSH! I am sooooo angry?	My daughter is 18m. She still takes a bottle once a day at night, sometimes she takes it, some night she doesnt. She takes a sippy or a sports bottle through the day. And I give her an open cup once a day or when she asks for it - ie, if i give her a sippy and she says ''no big girl'' meaning she wants the ''big girl cup''      Anyway, at t ime she gets frustrated with it. It is the one with the lid and the small hole. So sometimes she turns it round so her mouth isnt at the hole.      My parents were in adn she started to get ratty with it. Once she starts drinking from it, generally she wants to continue. My mother started making remarks about how she was still too young (its an 18m+ cup) and other remarks.      I go to the toilet and I come back in and there is my daughter drinking JUICE from a BOTTLE.       Im so angry, she totally undermined me. She then went on to say my sister took a dummy to school with her and why was I rushing her. I felt totally humiliated and incompetent.      So my question is has anyone ever undermined you like this, if so what happened.

But, My last period was January 29th- 3rd.   my period is due next week. BUT I had spotting for 2 days. VERY VERY LIGHT only needed to change my tampon 1 time, and there was a line of blood on it . Then I wiped and there was nothing (the 1st day) the 2nd day I wiped 1 time and there was spotting light pink. Nothing the rest of the day. Today no blood, but feeling nauseous, light annoying cramping, backache, sleeping a lot, dizzy. (flu like symptoms) .       I took the 1st pill of the pack late (due to picking up the prescription, and having trouble with insurance paying for it.)        I know, that you can have pregnancy signs with the pill. But, the 2 day light spotting through me off when my period is due next week. Just wondering was that implantation bleeding?      according to my last period I would be 4 weeks pregnant. I feel so sick. I don't know whats going on, and that darn spotting through me off. What do you think?

I have a bumbo for him but b/c he is on the smaller side he looks like he is going to topple out of it when he turns to look at other stuff close by...      is there something else that could work for him to sit in like when we eat supper and stuff (after he has already eaten)?  he's still not overly fond of sitting in his little highchair.      I know our days are limited with his bouncy seat since he tries to sit up in it sometimes...fortunately though, like now, it still works when he is dozing off...

I still haven't gotten my period,so when should I test again. Just a little background info: I experienced some type of naseau on 2/15, 2/16, 2/17 and 2/18. I still get little waves now and again,but I remember it being really bad on those days. Also, I've been having cramps like my cycle is about to start, but to no avail. Lastly, I've been eating like there is no tomorrow. But only certain things cuz some stuff makes me naseous. Ok... another thing I though was wierd is that my boobs get really sore right b4 my cycle starts,but they haven't been sore at all so far. I read somewhere that breast sensitivity was a pretty major sign of pregnancy.  Anyway, I really wanted to just get some opinions because I've never been pregnant b4. So... should I test again... If so, when? And if that is still negative, then what???

I have really bad anxiety and I usually take something for it but since I am pregnant and have had some previous complications I dn't want to put nething in my body that isn't totally needed. I am just so worried about having a m/c. I keep trying to not think about it but I have already been through so much with this pregnancy that I am sooo worried. Please don't tell me that I need to not think about it b/c anyone who has anxiety knows its easier said than done!! My dr told me that the chance of having a m/c is next to nothing now and I asked a question earlier and heard of people having a m/c even after seeing a heart beat. But how common is this?? And what can I do to get through this anxiety?? (My dr does a scan every week and @ his office they only follow you to 10 weeks and send you to another ob)          *9wks 1 day   *yesterdays appt baby was moving his/her nubs heart rate was 176   *last week heart beat was 140   *previous week 120   *have a blood clot and the dr says it looks like its reabsorbing itself and very common in pregnancy      If anyone has any insight I would really REALLY appreciate it!!!! <3<3
20081029133008AA3hSIx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do or did you get baby to sleep on their own?	My daughter is 8.5 months old, I have always let her go to sleep in my arms and then transfer her to bed while she is sleeping.  She won't go into the cot while awake she cries and tries to climb out!   I don't see it as a problem but as she gets older I would like her to be able to settle down easier.  She has a bedtime routine which is bath, change into bedtime clothes, bottle or breast then either goes to sleep with me holding her or my boyfriend then carried to bed!   I'm a first time mom and some of you may not like my routine but it's what we are both used to.  I Just would like to know how do you get your little ones to go to sleep at night.

20090227101540AATA8F1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	HCG Rising but Didn't double This time?	The possibility of ectopic was ruled out b/c my doc believed that I miscarried a 2nd baby (fraternal twins run on my mothers side of the family).      My HCG was low when I found out I was pregnant. After 48 hours, it almost tripled. I went in for some bloodwork about 48 hours after that and it only went up about 60.      I know that some women just don't produce HCG that well. But it's bothering me because starting yesterday, my nipples started to get really sore (whereas before they werent) and I still have prominent blue veins all over my body (namingly my hands, legs, feet and left breast).      My doctor did not suggest a D&C, as she said that "it went up," so its hopeful.      What are your experiences ladies? I'm so tired of this emotional rollercoaster. I can't even be 'excited' or happy about all of this because of how draining it is to constantly go through it.      Any thoughts?

20090227102548AA3IvNJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	When your babies wake up in the middle of the night...?	How long does it take you to actually get up and feed or change etc?       When my baby first came home I was up 8 times a night as soon as I heard a little whimper of hunger, but now he's a little older (2.5months,) and it takes me longer. He sleeps in a bassinet right next to me.   I've been feeling guilty about waiting for the crying to begin before I grunt, rub my eyes, take a breath and get up. Sometimes I still get up quickly, but other times, I'm just tired.      So I just wanted to know, if you moms are up quickly, or if getting up is hard.      He only gets up once now.
20090227102736AAqWyPM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I know pregnancy dreams are weird...but yikes!?	So last night i had a dream.  Long story short.  I walked in on my husband with another women.  The main thing is everyone i told kept saying " you really should have seen this coming" and "it's because of all the pressure you put on him".  Now, I don't think my husband is actually having an affair.  But something is really bothering me, obviously.  We are very excited about this baby.  But, it will be a little bit of a strain on our family at first.  This is our third and not planned.  Is this just hormones making this a bigger deal than it is?
20090227075628AAM0VhP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How can i deal with my crazy mom?	I am 13 weeks pregnant with my third. My husband and I, after the initial shock, are very excited. Well, last weekend when i was visiting my mom she asked me if I was gaining weight (which i think is totally rude). I said that i really hadn't noticed but thanks for asking (dripping with sarcasm). Well, she replied "as long as your not pregnant again". Yikes. We did not plan this pregnancy.  But, there isn't a reason in this world it should be considered a "bad" thing. We make a very good living, get along well, and love our children. I have no idea how to tell her now.    btw i love my mom but she really is very over bearing.
20090227112626AArlWf7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can someone answer these questions about pregnancy, I need to know?	I asked this briefly yesterday, sorry for posting twice, but I was typing quickly and didn't add all details.      Well my wife had a miscarriage, happened Jan 11th and we started having sex again nearly 3 weeks later (around the 27th or 28th of Jan probably), if she is pregnant then the foetus could be 4 weeks old (at the most) now? Will the docs be able to tell exactly how old it is?      Two pregnancy tests said positive, but we're not going to assume she's actually pregnant until the doctor appointment next week incase it's still hormone levels from the last pregnancy, but I don't think it is cause those levels dropped back when she had the miscarriage.Will the doctor definitely know for sure if it's a new pregnancy or will we just have to wonder for longer?      If they do an ultrasound at this stage will anything be visible?      Sorry there's a lot of questions but I'm just kinda anxious about it, it's actually really hard for men to understand all this stuff or maybe it's just me lol      Anyway thanks for any answers,      Seth.

20090227102735AADxZ23	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is circumcision mutilation?	it has no function outside of religion(to make masturbation and sex less pleasurable so men dont sin), not a single health organization in the world recommends it.  it damages the penis.  it has no affect whatsoever on UTIs. it does nothing to prevent STIs/STDs.(research on this matter is flawed, and has shown that circumsizion prevents STDs, AND that circumsizion also does the exact opposite)  it is NOT cleaner.  a penis has to be washed whether circumsized or not.      there is no valid argument that can be made to support circumcision.  americans will claim "it looks better" because they were raised to see a mutilated penis as natural.  they dont understand what a healthy penis is supposed to look like.    they dont understand how a healthy penis functions, and why their mutilated penis is deficient.         if you disagree, i would like to hear why, and would also like your source for your info.

I have the 3D silver cross pram system, for the price of it I thought it would be a decent pram but since I have been using it for the past two months its really let me down.    My son is 8 weeks and has already nearly outgrown the pram part of it, but is far too little for the pushchair part as the shoulder straps are really high up and he cant hold his head. So what am I supposed to do? Grrrr....   Also its really bulky, and to take it anywhere is a nightmare, when folded down its in 4 parts!    So im trying to persuade my partner to let me sell it and buy a more suitable pushchair for our son.    But seeing as his mum got it for us and it wasnt cheap hes not keen on selling it....so I have some persuading to do.      Anyway,....

But now I cant look down from things or get down without feeling lightheaded and scared to death I will fall. If I get on a chair to get something out of a cupboard, its hard to get down, I can go up steps, but even 3 steps going down freaks me out, I walk on my fiances back on our bed to pop it for him and if I look down off the bed or think about being up there, I get all light headed. Today I was going down some stairs and slipped on one, the first time in years I have slid on a step, is pregnancy causing this clumbsy-ness/ fear? I am 19 weeks btw, this started it seemed at about 11-12 weeks.

20081010082624AAKR8J5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Nightmares about your kids?	I just woke up from a nap with my 15 month old. I had the worst dream EVER! For some reason I tend to have nightmares about my son, the middle child. He's almost 7 years old. I dreamed that I gave him his medication and out of nowhere he looked really pale and his lips looked blue. Next thing I knew he was unconscious and nurses were doing CPR on him. I was a mess, screaming and crying for them to help my baby. They came to me and told me there was nothing they could do. I went to him to hold him and he started breathing again but was still very sick. I HATE when I have these kids of dreams. They seem sooooo real. Do you other mommies out there ever have horrible dreams where something happens to your kids? I can't wait till he gets home from school so I can hug him and just know he is ok.

20090227103250AAtJkGs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it possible to be pregnant?	Hi Im freaking out yesterday me and my boyfriend where having sex. When we went to change positions we noticed that the condom had broke! He had not yet ejaculated, but I've read way too many questions on here that refer back to "pre-***" and know that there is still the posibility that seman got into my vagina.      Anyways heres the problem I recently started the birth control patch, and have been on it for the past two weeks. Now the patch claims to be 99 % effective after one week of use which is something I don't trust. Also during my first week on gan to the patch it began to come lose and as a result I had to keep it stuck which medical tape and am not sure how effective that method was.      Being so unsure of my birth control I decided to take plan be within about5-6 hours of the condom breaking. I know it's 95 perecent effective but Im still stressing out! Also this sounds horrible but a month ago our condom broke and seeing as I was not on BC I had to take Plan B.      What are the risks of taking Plan B so oftten? If there are any?      and do you think that I am pregnant?
20090227094016AAXxOLy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this common? 7 days late for period......?	Period like cramps while your supposed to be having your period, but were pregnant?      My period was due around the 21st. Its now the 27th and still no sign of period. As far as I know, I ovulated around the 5-6th of feb and did have unprotected sex on the 6th. I have been off the birth control pill since november...      FYI: Last periods went like this,   Jan 21   Dec 21   Nov 19   Oct 24   My periods were very regular after going off the pill. Now it seems to have completely disappeared off the face of the earth.. :P      Symptoms I have experienced:   Slight twinges here and there after ovulation for about a week and a half.   One morning I woke up to immense lower back pain that lasted for 24hrs.   White lotiony discharge   now, my breasts are a bit swollen and nipples are sensitive.   as well as cramps here and there.      I took a pregnancy test three days ago, came back negative. I'm just about going nuts. I've never been pregnant before, but I know my body very well... I shouldnt be this late for my period.. and my cramps are a little different than period cramps are, though, i do get a couple period like cramps here and there.      Anyone experience this? What causes this? is it just our bodies reaction to the blood in your uterus being USED instead of releasing it?   Please help! I'm so confused with myself!

20090227102747AARfmkg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	3-month-old turning over question?	My daughter started rolling from her back to her tummy last week, at 13 weeks!  But she can't figure out how to get from her tummy to her back yet.  Everything I read says this usually happens in the opposite way (from tummy to back first).      She will hang out on her tummy, with her head held high up, for quite awhile just looking around, but then she will get frustrated because she can't figure out how to get over onto her back.  I get concerned that she'll do this while she's sleeping and won't be able to get back over.  She sleeps in a bassinet in our room with us, so I would probably be able to hear if there was a problem, but it still concerns me.      Thoughts?  Any ideas for helping turn over the other way?  Thanks!

I love Egyptology, I love the mysteriousness, and I love that it's spelled/pronounced royally. We want a name that sounds cultural and elegant at the same time, we love the meaning, and that it's an uncommon name without being crazy.      What do you think?       Amunet   Pronunciation: Ah-mu-net   Origin: Ancient Egyptian   Meaning: Egyptian Goddess of Mystery      Please don't suggest other names, flame, or do anything in vein of these things. I've seen some people act very rude to others and it's just ridiculous.      Thank you everyone in advanced. :D

20081016075126AAjxv3X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	My boyfriends having a child with someone else?	I could really do with some help, I don't know if anyone has any experience of this...   I got together with my boyfriend 3 months ago, everything was going great but he stayed to act strange. We were on the verge of parting when he told me that somebody he slept with 2 weeks before we met was this other lady was experiencing a pregnancy scare adn this was putting him under an awful amount of pressure.   She has contacted him recently and told him that she is going through with the pregnancy and that it's a girl.   This other woman put him through the mill, kept ignoring him and wouldn't give him any answers to what she was going to do. She already has a seven year old little girl from a previous relationship.   My partner doesn't particularly like children, he doesn't get the whole thing and is particulary unpaternal.    He's a good guy and he is going to financially assist this other lady with the up bringing of the child. He has also said that he will spent time with the child. The more this goes on the harder I am finding it. She said that for the first few months she wouldn't expect him to have the little girl over night but to spend time with her at her home with both of them. It makes me feel so sick that when we met everything was so simple and all we had in front of us is quality time together.   I would like children one day but if my future partner was un paternal as this one I don't feel I would. It would be more of a burden to him than something to enjoy and I wouldn't ever want to put that on somebody.   I know I'm being selfish and jealous but I don't know if I can be with him and make this whole thing any easier and support him like I should.   It's getting harder than before, before he would refer to the unborn child as "that kid" now it's more like "my daughter" and it's hurting me.   I trust him and the other woman was just a one night stand, someone he used to work with years ago, I'm just so scared of becoming second.   Can anybody offer any help.

I have an ADHD child, but I don't feel like I should tr to cash in on his illness when my husband is making a decent living for us. People who can get it who truly need it deserve it.

20090225100029AAw6aHy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	A little bit of confusion?	On February 15, I had protected sex with my boyfriend. After he ejaculated, the condom got stuck inside me. He noticed right after obviously and managed to get it out with his fingers (Sorry for TMI). We are not sure if any semen got inside me at all because we saw semen inside the condom. When I went to the bathroom, I wiped and there was tons of white/clear on the t.p. I'm not sure if it was all of the lube, me, or the semen. Then later on that day, I felt a lot of stuff come out of me and I went to the bathroom and there was tons of white(SORRY!). I'm not sure what it was exactly though. I probably sound dumb, sorry. I checked my ovulation calender and it says my most fertile day is the 16th or 17th. So I ovulated that whole week.   -3 days ago I had slight slight period cramps.   -2 days ago I went to the bathroom and wiped and there was light light brown and at the end of the day I checked my underwear and there was a tiny amount of brown but I haven't had the cramps or brown since.   -Period is due about March 3rd.   -I have had sex other times besides that day too.         Do you think that was implantation bleeding? Has anyone you know or you gotten pregnant from the condom getting stuck inside? What colour/when does implantation occur? Any additional advice would help, thanks!

20090225100449AAz20Df	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Mom's who didn't want to go back to work FT.  How did you learn to accept it?	I always wanted to be a stay at home mom who homeschools.  As things go, I have realized that once I have this baby (our third), I will have to put the kids in daycare and return to work.  Financially, it isn't sensible for me to be home anymore.  I have no work experience outside of retail management, but I have an MBA.        I am so disappointed in myself that I have to quit on my kids and give them to someone else to raise, but I know that in America that's the norm.  How do people do this and be OK with it?  Please don't suggest that I will will still have them alot of the time because with 8 hours of work, a half hour commute, dinner, and housework, I can't imagine I'll have more than 10 hours a week with my children.         I know some people are going to critisize me for my view on this, but I am sincerely looking to learn how to deal with this.  I would not have brought children into a situation knowing that I wouldn't be able to care for them.  I feel like a complete failure.  I feel like I've been cornered into this desicion though, due to our financial situation.      Please give me advice on how you dealt with having to leave your kids.  I am so ashamed and embarrased.  I feel horrible for what this is going to do to them.  I have considered working an overnight shift already, but realize that aside from the normal 9-5 jobs, there probably won't be enough money in any overnight type job.  I have worked PT for the last two years, but will need to make the transition to daytime work to make more money.      Please tell me how you got over the guilt and embarrassment.
