20090205012103AAxnlEb	Health;Women's Health	Period trouble related to morning after pill?	I took the morning after pill about 2 weeks ago and started my period six days after I took it (it was regular and light most of time and heavy at some points), though I only bled some times. Like during the late afternoon. I still had my normal cramping when I started my period that I usually get.      Now its been nine days and I am still bleeding. My period got heavier and it had been 8 days and I was cramping again. Also a small white sack was on my pad (around size of thumb nail) and was shape of kidney bean from what I remember.       I also started my period the exact same day it got heavier last month.      I am still currently cramping sometimes throughout the day and the bleeding is sort of heavy. I've asked my mum and she said it could be to do with stress.      What could be wrong and could it have something to do with taking morning after pill?

Scusate la ripetizione, mi rendo conto di fare sempre le stesse domande, mi mancher qualche rotellina, ma cercando e ricercando su internet ancora non sono convinta di alcune cose, perch trovo molti articoli in contraddizione..    Allora, sono ipotiroidea e ormai l'avrete capito tutti dalle volte che l'ho ripetuto (scusate!!).. Volevo semplicemente provare dei fanghi Guam, perch ho iniziato a prendere la pillola e nonostante sia passato poco tempo da quando ho iniziato, gi noto dei peggioramenti a livello di ritenzione idrica.. Siccome leggevo che per le propriet che hanno, questi fanghi potrebbero aiutarmi, volevo provarli.. Allo stesso tempo per ho letto che contengono iodio.. Io, essendo ipotiroidea, dovrei essere felice di assumere iodo, ma ho letto che assumere iodio in quantit eccessive potrebbe causare il problema inverso e quindi paradossalmente non mi aiuterebbe a migliorare l'ipotiroidismo e la cellulite allo stesso tempo, ma mi potrebbe provocare problemi..

Per favore, rispondete seriamente e sinceramente a queste domande, come ho detto voglio molto bene alla mia ragazza e non vorrei deluderla, e vorrei che "quel" momento sia speciale. Grazie a tutti.

20090204223812AAh9qLS	Health;Women's Health	Vaginal yeast infection -- Do you have to have sex to get one?	Okay, about two or three days ago, I noticed that my, erm. . . . . . let's be forward. . . . . my vagina has become somewhat reddened on the inner lips and has become moderately itchy at times. I can't scratch, because if my fingers touch the itching parts, it burns! I've been taking a lot of showers lately to try and sooth the itching and burning, but it only works for a while. I thought I could wash away any infection I may have.      So, my question: I have never had sex before, and I haven't masturbated in a LONG time (like, a year!) so how is it possible that I could have a vaginal yeast infection? I'm sure it will go away on its own, but right now I just had to ask because people have started asking me why I look uncomfortable and why I'm sitting funny (on my *** instead of straight up like I used to). It's because it hurts to sit normally!      Could it just be the lips rubbing together or something simple like that? I keep myself very clean down there, but maybe something got inside? It's not a UTI, because it doesn't burn when I urinate, only when the urine touches the inner skin of the vaginal lips.      I know it sounds weird, but I know many people get yeast infections, it's a part of life! Don't laugh, please, I just need a straight answer and reason!      I have no bumps around or on the inner or outer parts of the vagina, so it's nothing like that.      Help, please? Anyone with experience in this sort of topic are VERY welcome here, and anyone with real life medical experience (an obgyn, gynecologist, doctor, nurse. . . . etc,.), I'll love you forever.

We were watching tv one day and an ExtenZe commercial came on and I was trying to be smooth and I was like "ha, if I had a penis, I'd so try that to see if it works or if they were just lying." Just to see what his reaction was and he replied with "haha, yeah I'd like to try it!" So... I got the green light to buy it for him without it being an awkward gift of saying "hey honey, you're small, you obviously didn't get pinched to grown an inch on your birthdays"... but I want to know if actually works first. I mean, Valentine's day is coming up and I could spend 30 bucks towards something else as part of his present, ya know lol      Thanks!      Samantha Jo~

Also, I don't have the headaches upstairs, just on the first floor of the house (furnace in basement).       On the other hand, maybe my headaches are simply stress related or the result of an inoperable brain tumor (*knocking on wood now*).

20090204224813AAOK1ib	Health;Women's Health	How do i stop my period from having such a profound effect on me each cycle?	Every month my cycle seems to be getting worse and worse. As soon as I wake up out of bed I feel like going straight back. I feel unbelievably tired all the time even my bones feel tired. I have my period now and right now I feel like throwing up, also the pain is excruciating, especially sometimes when I am trying to sit down. It also feels like my thoughts are a lot more scattered, like I wouldnt be able to trust myself with making any big decisions in my first few days of having my period, because I always tend to forget something that would come so easily to normally. Is this normal? And is there anyway of making this an easier time for me?

20090204231152AAVTAt3	Health;Men's Health	Why am I one the ugliest, tallest, hated people living?	Why was I even born? I mean, compared to everyone else around me I look like total zombie. I do everything in my power to keep up on my appearance but it is no use, for people seem to avoid me at all costs. I have never been able to befriend anyone before, and now that I'm 19 years old going on 20, I know that never will. With the combination of my hideous face, my huge stature (6'1 and a half!!!,), people are just too afraid of me to even consider talking to me. Why was I born such a monster? I don't even know why I'm hear in the first place. Whenever I have to be out in public I just keep my head down and not look at anyone for fear of offending them, Especially women, who I never look at for fear that the will try and call the police. I a really nice person, it's just that my body makes it impossible for me to show this. I wish I knew who my father was. He ditched my mother when she found out she had "mistakenly gotten pregnant. My mother is a very overweight women who no longer likes to speak to me. She never wanted me in the first place. so what's the point of going on when you know your not going to go anywhere? At age 19 I'm ready for my life to be over with. Is there any reason this monster to keep going? ANY!?
20090204231908AAZpwlh	Health;Alternative Medicine	Brahmi (Bacopa Monnieri) and oral contraceptives?	I have seen it noted that Brahmi promotes fertility, and have furthermore seen it suggested that it may reduce the efficacy of the birth control pill.  Is this simply folk legend, or is there scientific evidence to indicate that Brahmi promotes fertility, and more importantly that it reduces the efficacy of oral contraceptives?  I really want to take Brahmi to help with anxiety, not to mention the general cognitive benefits, but don't want to have concerns regarding the complete effectiveness of my birth control pills.  I know there are other herbal remedies for anxiety, but most either lack sufficient scientific evidence to convince me to try it, or else have harsh side effects (such as damage to the liver).

20090204235643AAjVePJ	Health;Alternative Medicine	I just started taking Adderall for possible ADD (a few questions)?	Long story, I was prescribed Adderall but insurance wouldn't pay for it until I tried Concerta. That didn't work at all, so today I got Adderall. It says on the container to take 1/2 pill twice a day(because it's not XR, I'm supposed to make the same dose last longer). So at about 8PM, I took a half. 30minutes or so later, I quickly get this feeling all over my body that's kind of tingly under my skin. I also get light-headed, slight dizziness, and a fake exhaustion(I felt way tired but had plenty of energy). At the time, I was filling out a tax form at the table and had to stop and lay my head down for a minute. It was the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me. After a while, I feel kind of slowed down, both in mind and body. I can still move quickly, but it feels weird. The thing is, most of the side-effects I experienced were not listed on the Wikipedia page on Adderall.      Are these normal effects? What exactly will I notice if it works? I learned that Adderall is mixed amphetamine salts. So how is it related to methamphetamine?

When it first did this it spread across the top of my head to the hairline from then on its shot down my spine or both it seems to get only more intense. Sometimes it feels like it might engulf my entire body. Within recent weeks it has spread to my face it makes my cheeks feel like they tight also it will sometimes now start on random places along my spine. This has really started to worry me. That is the best way I can describe it. Please give any information on what you think or if you have experience anything similar if you please give as many details as possible. Thanks.
20090204230541AACMMzi	Health;Men's Health	Never reached an orgasm?	Okay so im 16 and lost my virginity a couple of months ago but never reached an orgasm? We went for like 45 minutes and it just never happened... I was drunk so idk if that would effect it but i also wasn't wearing a condom, she was on the pill. And its not like i wasn't "stimulated" or anything, it wasn't a drunk ugly regret it **** is what im trying to say. Well anyways, ive had sex once since then with a different girl and the same thing happened, oral didn't really work either. So im just confused and idk whats going on or what to do at this point. I don't think anythings necessarily wrong with me but i am also circumcised which might decrease sensitivity and such. Any suggestions? And please don't lecture me on how im to young to be having drunk unprotected sex, it wont help me.

Im very strong in the mind so dont be afraid to give me something challenging but I dont want to have another injury.

20090204235922AAY3ktK	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Bad marijuana trip? Has anyone else experienced something like this?	Ok so i have only smoked weed one time before this. I dident even feel high or different in anyway but when i tried it a second time it was the scareist thing that had ever happend to me. First my vision turned red and it felt like my head exploded and my ears were ringing. Then my heart started pounding. Everything went back to normal...for a few seconds. Then my vision went green and i saw moving purple spots. After that i left my friends house and walked to my other friends house. On the way there it looked like i was walking and when i stopped it looked like i was still walking but then it was like i was teleported back to the same place. Weird thing is i never left that spot. Then when we got alittle farther and i felt my jaw vibrating. I ignored it. Bad idea. Then as i was walking it got worse and it went around my ears and the back of my head. I got scared and touched my face and it stopped as soon as i did. Then i was walking and the same thing with the teleported crap started happening AGAIN. I kept walking to my friend houes. When we got there i remember our eyes were red aswell as the skin around them and our faces were dark green. I sat down and looked at the cealing. It looked and felt as if it was coming twored me really fast. I closed m eyes and it still felt like that. That happend for a long time. Then i went and sat on the couch. It felt like my heart literally exploded. It kept doing this several times. Then i started to pass out. I woke up gagging. I ran out into the garage and told the person my friend was staying with what we had done. Then i vomited three times in a row. The guy wanted to check my blood preasure. I remember it was 182 over 62. Then my dad came and got me and then everything started to go away when i got home. Then i started having panic/anxiety attacks. I described what i was feeling to my dad and he said that was what was going on. He has had his panic attacks for almost 30 years so im pretty sure he knows what hes talking about but sometimes it just gets so scary that i dont care what he says. Then one night it got so bad that i had him take me to the ER at 3am. The doctor did some blood tests and EKG and a chest x-ray. Everything came back normal. I was having them for about 2 or 3 weeks after then on a daily baises. Sometimes 2 or 3 in one day. Now i had a very minor one today. Thats an entire week without a panic attack. I feel pain with my panic attacks everytime. Since that day i have been feeling very weird. And now i get cold on certian parts of my head for no reason and i have devloped moderatley severe stomach pain. I havent felt normal in my head since all that happend. It was in the 1st 2nd or 3rd week of january. What i really want to know and what ive been trying to figure out is what was in that marijuana??? Was there anything in it? Is it all in my head or is something making me do this? Can you get panic attacks from smoking weed? Please only serious answers

20090205011032AARQMn9	Health;Diet & Fitness	Losing weight indoors when you're a teenager?	I've been trying to lose weight for years but any time I was really "serious" about losing it, I would always mess up. The most I ever lost was 15 lbs and that was in 2006. I'm sick and tired of being fat and unhealthy and I want to lose the weight once and for all.      The last week I have been dancing more and using the exercise bike more. I've also been watching the way I'm eating, watching portions, writing everything down and drinking a ton more water. I'm still keeping up with this so I figured I'd post here and ask for any smart advice for losing weight? There's no specific amount in mind, I just want to get healthier, stronger and I want to get rid of some health problems (asthma, borderline diabetic, etc)      I have two weights, both are different, not the same. A stepper machine (not really high tech, but it's usable) and an exercise bike. We also have DDR, stairs leading up to the bedrooms, dancing (which I love doing) and a long street that we live on. The only problem about the street is that there's a lot of ice and snow and when walking, depending on how fast of course, my asthma acts up. That's probably the main reason of why I dislike exercising. I also had a knee injury last year that never got fixed/healed/whatever. So I'm not sure. I would go to the doctors but my family has just been having a hard time over the last couple months, so everything is hard.      Any advice, tips or suggestions for weight loss or even eating healthy are very much welcomed and appreciated! Thank you :)

I'm wondering if i get the same nutritional value from a protein powder shake ( amino acids ) than if i ate tuna.      i was running some math, and i found out that tuna, has more protein than the powders.      one of the best powders ( Complete Whey Protein by   CytoSport )  has only 18 grams of protein on a 90 calorie serving size.       where tuna from walmart ( great value ) has 22 grams in 100 calories.       ( 1 can )      that's 5 calories per gram of protein. vs 4.5 with tuna.  ( tuna wins )         so again, my question is. do i get the same amino acids from tuna protein than from shake protein ?      or to boil down my question even more.      is all protein the same ? no matter where you get it from?

20090205021842AAjXucI	Health;Dental	If your on the NHS can you can invisible....?	If you’re on the NHS (National Hospital Service, free. I think =S im 14)    Anyway if you’re on the NHS and getting braces fitted with them, can you get invisible braces? Not the colour of the bands, I mean the wire that is usually silver/metal, I want it to be clear so it’s not visible as im 14 and in year 10 (one year until leaving school, and I think that’s grade 9 in America, btw =D) and I don’t really want them as it would make me look young and I don’t know how long I need them on for as my prom is next year so I might need them on for that D= and I don’t really want them on for going to New York in July! But I might only have them on for six months... anyway, im blabbing on and on and on...    Do you have to pay for invisible braces or can you get them free from the NHS?   Also, does anyone know a good website (please don’t say Photoshop, as I don’t know how to download that onto my laptop, but if you do say that give me instructions on how to get it) that I could post in a picture of me and put braces on me so that I can see what I look like with braces.   How long is the average time to have braces on?   I haven’t been able to ask my dentist yet, as the waiting list was too long for a dentist I was going to, so I got referred to one closer to my house where the waiting list isn’t as long, but the orthodontist sent a letter to my dentist and my home, but not the place I got referred to, so I have been waiting since October/ September so my mam called them and asked them what was going on and they are trying to fit me in as soon as possible, as I have waited ages and there waiting list goes into may, but they’re going to try and fit me in this month, so how long do you have to have braces in, does it hurt, and does it make your lips and just above your mouth stick out? (Im getting braces on the top teeth.)   As you may be able to tell I am quite nervous! And scared!! Any help greatly appreciated and I will give thumbs up to all! =)

20090205020501AAAqnFR	Health;Mental Health	What are my options? I'm not going to school tommorow and I can't keep doing this? *long read: but urgent*?	Ok, so I'm 15 and I've been dealing with depression/insomnia/anexity for 3 years now and it's like it's really catching up to me. . . really bad.       It's 5 A.M. I'm supposed to wake up at 7. It's just not going to happen. My mom is taking care of my grandma and I tried to talk to my dad about it and he was like, "Yeah you'll have a rough day at school tommorow." And I'm just like, "Yeah but dad, I need help, I can't fix my sleeping problem, it's getting really bad."... and he was still like, "Yep rough day tommorow."       I've missed 11 days this year! (which for how bad I am is suprisingly not very many). And I'm going to miss another tommorow, I'm like extreamly sick of missing this many days and being so nervous at school from not sleeping and not eating right. It's like I'm really really screwed right about now. My parents (as loving as I always thought they were, they just aren't.) and I haven't been back to the therapist in 2 months. My mom keeps forgetting to make appointments, and I'm thinking about my options right about now. . . nobody will take me seriously AT ALL, and I'm fed up with it. I'm begining to think my parents are going to let me ruin my damn life and not even try to help me though this.       It's a shame.       What do you think my options should be? Try to get my sleeping and anexity under control. *which I've tried, it just dosen't work well by yourself* Or start missing and hope that people start taking me seriously and get into an online school or something. . .       I know it sounds crazy, but it'll have to happen sooner or later, I can't keep tearing myself up day in and day out.       Advice? I feel like a failer right now. It's freakin terrible.
20090205022202AA2PQnI	Health;Men's Health	I have a problem with masturbation and also with my using of adult phone lines. Can you help me?	Have you had a problem of using adult sex lines when you didn't want to? And have you been able to stop?   I use them and I don't want to. I keep trying not to use them, and I am seeing a therapist about it. I have seen doctors earlier.    I've had this problem for 10 years now. I've constantly been trying not to masturbate and not to go on the adult phone sex lines either. Actually the two things seem to happen in unison. I do wonder if my not masturbation leads me to the sex lines, but I am also aware that the sex lines offer an added excitement. But I feel bad after going to the sex lines. And I feel bad after masturbating too. I know that masturbating is deemed OK and that 99% of men supposedly do it. I seem to end up masturbating and going to the sex lines about every 2 weeks. Pressures, stresses and perhaps my inner biology seem to make it a 2 week thing for me. I resist in the interim - easily at first. I do wonder if it's due to repression or course. I've even attempted making masturbation OK by itself but it seems difficult not to move on to phone sex for me. Obviously also I don't want to fill the pockets of those who run sex phone lines nor empty mine by using them.       I feel bad/dirty if I just masturbate. I feel bad/dirty if I go on the phone lines and do it too but of course I get the added excitement of it on the phone doing things I don't actually want to do for real on the phone first.

20090205031829AAWfgMY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Why am I so opposed to going to doctors for my skin?	Ok...So I've had a bit of trouble with my skin over the last couple of months...I change residence and my skin started to get progressively worse, so I'm now entering the severe acne zone...Ok, so it's probably not severe, but it looks it..my skin pigments easily, and I'm in pain.  But whatever. Here is the deal: I've been to the doctor before for this reason, and I've been through a couple of antibiotics. Didn't work, just made me emotionally unstable.  I did the proactiv thing, but my skin got worse. And I had to get off it because it was too expensive for me. Now i think maybe I should have stuck to it, but still.  When I moved I went to the doctor again, and I asked him about birth control (dianette because they don't have ortho-tricycline here) ...He said it was too strong, and he wanted to try other antibiotics first....I believe he said that it is best to exhaust all milder options...and if that doesn't work then he'll send me to a derm.  Well, the antibiotic he prescribed worked for about a second, and after the 8 weeks of the prescription, I stopped it. Slowly, but surely, my skin just got horrible.  My diet was healthy, but I tried to make it more healthy. I tried natural, gentle remedies like olive oil...which worked for a bit, but i dunno what happened.  I don't want to try another antibiotic after another antibiotic, and accutane....that has a bajillion side effects.  But I feel like my mom is pressuring me to do something about it, and I just want to figure out how to deal with it in a simple, healthy way.

When he got shot it nearly killed me but as he says he loves his job and never wants to leave it or me. I absolutely adore him and cant wait to marry him.

One time i was standing on hot Iron when i was 3 years old and i accidentally fell on it and my head touched the iron and i was treated for severe injury.   Another time there was a nail at my room and i accidentally knocked on it really hard and fainted.   My mom had a car accident and my head had hit the front bumper.   Another time i was trying to fix my computer and my head accidentally touched the reer of the PC while it was still on and my head got electrofied...      I'm still alive, and able to function normally but i feel very weird as if i have no life anymore...      What are your Experiences?

20090205055912AATd3kt	Health;Women's Health	Heavy bleeding for 3 days straight...on birth control?	I have taken my birth control on time for the last 10 months. I've had break through bleeding before and this is not it. I wear a super tampon and pad at the same time and still leak through in about 2 hours. I've taken a pregnancy test worried I could have had a miscarriage but it turned up negative.    When do you think I should be concerned and go to the doctor? I have no insurance so I am waiting to see if it slows down any, but by the looks of it, it hasn't slowed down at all since it started. This isn't even a normal period for me...never in my life have I bled so much before. By the way I am 23 y/o and I have 2 kids.   Since I have no insurance would anyone suggest going to Planned Parenthood to get a pap smear?    Thanks!

Thus three teeth crowded together....I then need a reallt deep filling in one of the teeth!

I'm sure it is because they teeth are so close together....but advise greatly appreciated???

20090205022331AAO2FCB	Health;Diet & Fitness	Do you think this form of dieting is ok?	I have a lot of trouble sticking to calorie restrictions long term, but I can go a few days at a time.  So I was thinking, is it ok to restrict your calories to 1200-1400 a day for around 3 or 4 days, then for 3 or 4 days eat a normal calorie intake?  I don't mean binge eating or eating junk food, but just to give your body a rest from being on caloric restriction.  I also thought that maybe that way you would keep your metabolism going strong because it wouldn't go into starvation mode.      Also, it would work out that over a period of a week, you ate lower calories overall, and isn't that what matters in weight loss?      Do you think this would be safe and effective?

If it means anything, I do have very 'young' looking skin, and even though I'm very overweight I seem quite firm with it, you know?      Anyway I know nobody can say for sure but what are your opinions?  Has anyone experienced a large weight loss?  Thanks.

20090205030838AA8pT79	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	How can I speed up the healing of my severely sprained left foot?	I googled "foot sprain" and discovered (to my dismay) that a severe foot sprain can take up to 2 months to heal!  My foot is swollen and bruised.  I still can't put any weight on the foot (after 5 days) so (according to articles I read) I (unfortunately) have a grade 3, severe foot sprain.      Ok, so here is the deal.  I have been spending my days mostly in bed.  I have been icing my foot every 2 hours.  I have been trying to keep my foot elevated above my heart level, but how the heck am I supposed to remain in that position when I am sound asleep?      Also, if this injury lasts for weeks or even months, am I really expected to lie on my back and keep my foot elevated on pillows every night?  I have a bulging disk in my back.  I was in severe pain for 4 months last summer (and several of you Y/A community members helped me more than you can possibly imagine).  Now my past fear has returned with a vengeance because, while the excruciating pain I was in just suddenly "magically" disappeared last September, about 6 weeks ago I started feeling tingly, numb sensations in my body (mostly in my legs).  Now that I'm literally forced to lay on my back with both my legs stretched out straight in front of me, I have been getting very irritating muscle spasms in both my legs (as well as still feeling weird and tingly in my legs and sometimes in my arms).      I can't ruin my back in order to heal my sprained foot.  I hate the way I feel when I lay on my back and elevate my foot, so I really need to know if doing this will be necessary for the duration of my injury?  Also, should I try to exercise my foot a little bit while I'm laying in bed?  When should I attempt to walk on the foot again?  Will I be in danger of re-injuring the foot?  This injury happened during an extremely stressful, emotionally draining, painful time in my life.  (My 8 year ex "love" recently broke my heart in unimaginable ways.)    I'm at a fragile point in my life where I really can't accept that this "freak accident" happened to me (on top of everything else).      it's Deja vu all over again for me.  Last summer I endured terrible pain so I could sit at the computer and ask questions out here on Yahoo Answers.  Tonight, I couldn't stand another second of laying in bed, so I crawled down the stairs-dragged my crutches along beside me-and used my crutches to help me hop to the computer in the kitchen.  My foot is not painful as long as I don't put any weight on it, but my foot still feels weird whether I am sitting at the computer or laying in my bed.      ***I am not in the kind of terrible pain that I was in last summer, but this situation still really, really sucks:)      I read some articles about foot sprains, but I'm desperate for information that might come from people who have firsthand knowledge of this type of injury.  I would appreciate all of your input and help :)

Hospital never did extensive test, "as I've been told because there is no bleeding, but what they have done was told my child she is pregnant.  They gave her prenatal 19 tabs, and worst yet...In the ER room she was seen by cardiologist.        Hospital has not called me for consent to treat.  My child is on the Depo shot and has been off Seroquil since being informed she was pregnant.  I'm trying to convince child that she needs to get her Depo that is due 2/11 and she's not trying to hear it.  She honestly believes she's pregnant and I know that if she finds out she's not, she'll start self harm.  I just don't know what to do at this point.        I've called Hospital and complained and they were supposed to get back with me as soon as they investigate.  In the meantime, my child is so unstable without her meds, and having a tendency to get irrationally violent.  She's also on Lithium.  This is her long time desire  and that to get pregnant.  Depo shot is current, and has been for the last couple years.

I'm not sure what i have and i don't want to self-diagnose but it's only ever because of my best friend.       I find myself sitting in my room, with no appetite and a horrible feeling of nausea. This is coupled with insecurity, jealousy and the imagination of someone with paranoia.      I can't tell her about it, since it will be very uncomfortable and i can't bring myself to risk distancing her one little bit.   I also had a dream about losing her.      Small things that she does that i interpret as her distancing herself or that she might be replacing me or leaving me.. things that other people would laugh at.

20090205030952AAQ401V	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Are there risks travelling after surgery?	My husband is being very pigheaded at the moment.  He has to go in for open hernia operation tomorrow, its hopefully just day surgery if all goes well, although its in the afternoon so slight possibility of an overnight stay.  In the leaflets that he has been given it says to not to return to a desk job for 2-4 weeks, and manual work for 6 weeks, his job is sort of inbetween .. he works in a hydraulic wholesalers, so receives deliveries from suppliers, packs up customer deliverys, prepares hose assemblies for customers, and other times sits at a desk quoting customers etc etc, anyway to cut the story short, he is telling work he'll be back this Monday!!!  I think he is crazy, he has never had surgery or an anaestetic before, he just doesn't know how he'll feel and I am so worried about him, and then last night to top it all off he comes home telling me that in a week's time his boss wants him to do a job 290 miles away from home, which will entail a 7-8 hour drive (if traffic is ok), stay overnight in a hotel and then do the drive back next day, and to my disbelief he told his boss he will do it and to book it all up - I went up the wall, I can't believe he is even contemplating going back to work so soon, never mind going to a job which involves a nearly 600 mile round trip a week after surgery, he says he won't be driving, which I'm not sure is true but would be illegal to drive so soon after surgery anyhow, he says his colleague will drive but I somehow can't see him driving all that way both days, and he isn't exactly caring as still doesn't help my husband carrying heavy stuff even though he knows about the hernia, but I suspect there is still the risk of DVT as a passenger and this must be raised after surgery and the discomfort he'll feel travelling all that way and the general effect on his health trying to still recover from surgery.  I don't know what to do about it, I am a worrier and really don't think he should go and I don't think his boss really knows what he is having done at hospital tomorrow, I'm almost tempted to ring his boss myself and tell him so he is aware, but I know my husband would never forgive me, he won't listen to me and I just don't know what to do, I didn't sleep a wink last night as he slept on sofa after row and I just couldn't sleep thinking about it all.  Any advice would be most appreciated    x

20090205031548AAwwOK6	Health;Mental Health	Problem with Wife and her sister's (sex related, NO MINORS)?	This happened about a year and a half ago. My (now) wife and I were staying at her mom's for a night. Her house wasn't very big and only accommodated 2 bedrooms and 1 bath. They did have a pull out couch in which I wanted to sleep on however Brandy(wife) insisted on sleeping with her sister in her bed(tootie). So I agreed. The arrangement was I was against the wall, Brandy was in the middle and Tootie was on the end (queen size bed). During the night about 3a.m.ish, tootie got up, and i'm a very light sleeper so i noticed. When she returned to the bedroom she was wearing a long shirt, panties and a bra (in which she was already sleeping in). She took her bra off and then laid back down. A little later I awakened to my wife moving my hand away from her sister saying "Hell No". In a subconscious I knew what i was doing, but on the other hand i was still kinda asleep. So ended it ended up that i was feeling on her sister's body (undershirt) and that's what happened. Ever since them they have labeled me a pervert. I never was really interested in a specific bra size in women, until that moment with her sister (nice sized D's) but now I am, I never masturbated a lot (just occasionally) but now i do, And every now and then that moment will run through my head. My wife keeps bringing it up when she's angry at me about something. Since then she has walked in on me masturbating to her other sister (leigh), It wasn't really intentional, but we were drinking and i was already doing it, and i ran across a picture of leigh in a bikini and that's when she walked in. SO, her mom, step-dad, both sister's, and both of the sister's husbands know of this. (my wife told them). I have apologized numerous times and i do really feel about about both situations, yet i still feel like i can't control the urge, or get the memories out of my head. I hate to be reminded that i messed up. That's not who i am.... I don't think... Any have any advice?      (by the way this is a serious post so don't reply saying, "just enjoy" or "do it again" i need a serious answer. I  don't want to lose my family) Thank you for any help.

I've always heard that when your hair gets too long, it'll make your head hurt.   I haven't had my hair this long in 5 years, so at first I thought that was what might be causing it.   But when I put my hair up into a bun it doesn't help like it's supposed to, my head just keeps pounding.      Then, I thought maybe it's because I am required to sit at the computer for 5+ hours everyday, so maybe that's what is making my head hurt.   But even when I'm not really on all that much it hurts.   Maybe I need glasses, but I've never had any trouble with my vision.            I've tried everything, I've drank more water, I've made sure that I'm getting enough sleep at night, I'm definitely not stressed, and for some reason my head hurts all the time!

20090205032002AAJ3Gd9	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	I really need some feedback?	Recently I have been diagnosed with "migraine with aura"   I have all the symptoms (nausea, dizziness, seeing stars) and usually don't develop a headache.      However,      I can not find anything about my other symptoms on the internet. They are as follows:      Incredibly fast heartbeat   Sweaty palms and feet   Diarrhea      and the most scary of all:   My legs first start to tremble and then: my legs, starting from my hips start to shake!      I always lay down in bed whenever I have one of these episodes. I CAN stand up, it's just very very unpleasant to do so. During the shaking I almost always have really bad abdominal pain, diarrhea and severe nausea.   It also got worse over the years: my first diagnosis was panic attacks, about 3 years ago. Only recently have I discovered on my own that it could be migraines and I told my doctor. He agreed with me   The shaking is NOT a panic attack. Because the meds I get for that don't work at all during these episodes.      Sorry if it seems a little non cohesive, I really can't make sense of it myself.

I have recently got married and me and my husband have been trying for a baby since August.      I have not had a period since September (bit of bleeding last month - January - but not a proper period) so my GP referred me for an ultrasound (all pregnancy tests and blood tests have come back negative for pregnancy and all my hormone levels are normal)      I had my ultrasound yday - well actually it was a transvaginal ultrasound where they use a probe (uncomfortable to say the least) and the tech asked me to contact my GP to tell her to refer me for an urgent gynae appt. she asked me to do this several times when I was there, so I asked her why she was stressing the URGENT bit of it.      She told me that the lining of my womb is very very very thick (her words - not mine) and that I must see a gynae doc urgently to sort it out. She didn't really tell me much else so I left panicking. As soon as I got home I naturally googled "thick womb lining" and got some scary results.      I have been worried sick and am still waiting to hear back from my GP (who will ring me back this afternoon).      I have had a hysteroscopy and a laparoscopy before because my bleeding was very heavy about 7 yrs back, but I am fine now, and since then my periods have been normal and regular (until October - when I missed my first period)      Has anyone got any insight or advice?

I am female of 24 yrs. i have a healthy lifestyle, eat sensibly workout 6 times a week for 3 hours and regular sleep; hate alcohol and never tried smoking and I had a regular menstruation cycle. But i got this desire to grow a few more inches so i took arginine and lysine supplements going on a month now (by the way, it's safe and effective combination as I've reasearched) and I noticed how it raised my HGH levels (so far so good I have growth spurt of an inch in just almost a month), I noticed i'm getting leaner than before and that's a good thing.

Im just worried, my menstruation just stopped, I hope im not paranoid that i may be getting barren (yikes! no way!)

20090205035730AAV723O	Health;Mental Health	I think I have developed a specific social anxiety disorder?	Ok, so its not like I avoid all social situations, I dont have a fear of going to work or going to school or anything      Specific social situations make me feel sick to my stomach, like im going to vomit, and sometimes I actually do vomit. Usually situations involving food.      I think this started early december when the section of the place I work at had a breakfast, and I wasnt feeling too well after eating and threw up in the toilets.      From then on, situations involving other people and food seem to make me feel extremely sick to the point of vomiting, and it has gotten to the stage where I cant eat anything in a social setting if someone else is around. At the same time, I also feel intensely uncomfortable, and sick to the bottom of my stomach, and it takes all my concentration not to vomit which means I dont enjoy the outing at all.      I recently met a girl and want to spend time with her, but everytime I do the above symptoms exhibit themselves and sometimes I have to rush outside to throw up, highly unattractive. This has made me feel very nervous about seeing her. I really want to, but im afraid i'll do something embarrassing.       For some reason I feel fine at parties with all my old school friends, we drink and eat pizza and all is well, the only thing that makes me sick is ofcourse too much alcohol      Im 18, and live by myself while attending university. I feel fine while im at home by myself. Is there some sort of medication I can take to reduce these symptoms? Something I can get over the counter at the pharmacy, or a herbal remedy?      Please help.
20090205035835AAIIwg3	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Spot on the inside of my thumb?	Had a little spot on the inside of my thumb for months now, at first it was small with a tiny hole at the top(no puss or colour/head) but I used to squeeze and it would just release a bit of dry white stuff (had a funny smell too). Anyways started getting abit painful by now, so I attempt to squeeze but it was to painful, then I tried a pin with more painful results (I know its stupid). Got a plaster and some Germolene left the plaster on overnight, and once I took it off I saw!         Basically it now has a head with yellow stuff in it (I think), again to painful to squeeze. It doesnt really hurt now, but closing my fists or grabbing stuff it does, but I guess thats due to it being on the joint of the thumb.      Anyways what is it!?

20090205055538AA5F0SM	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	A few questions on ear wax/ringing?	For the past week, my left ear has been feeling clogged and I'm assuming that it is an ear wax build-up. However, at random intervals during my sleep, I wake up to a slight ringing in my left ear. It's quite a nuisance. THE ONLY WAY that I've found to stop it is by popping my ears, if that helps. Also, whenever I move my jaw with my mouth close, I can feel a click in my left ear.      I'm already familiar with tinnitus, and hopefully that's not what's causing the problem.      Could the slight ringing be due to the ear wax blockage? I already plan on purchasing ear drops (Debrox).      10 points for best answer.   Thanks guys.

The doctors had to cut away part of his leg, and apparently the cold weather, being drunk and having asthma all contributed to his premature death.

20090205072048AAExK01	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Ultrasound guided core biopsy, does it hurt?	Here is my story.  I am a 30 year old female.  I found a small lump in my left breast about a month ago, near the nipple area.  I went to my pcp, he sent me for an ultrasound and mammo. When I got to the breast center they wanted to do the ultrasound first due to my age.  The ultra sound tech said she saw a tumor (i forget the name of it) and said its a benin tumor and she sees them a lot in girls my age and it looked like it was a cluster of grapes.  I have no pain.  They showed the doc at the breast clinic the ultrasound and she still wanted the mammo so i had that done the doc said it was pea sizes and very close to my skin and doesn't think its anything and I can have it checked out again in 6 months or have it removed.  On my way home she called me back and said she called my PCP with the results and he would rather have a biopsy done to for precaution.  I go for an ultrasound guided core needle biopsy on monday.  Will i be able to go to work after?  I am 30 years old and just had my first ultrasound and mammo and now a biopsy, i'm a little overwhelmed.
