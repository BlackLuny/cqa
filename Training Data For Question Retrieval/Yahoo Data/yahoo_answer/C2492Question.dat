I really would like to do Graphics design in the advertising side of things.    I am really interested in photography etc and would really like to get involved in something to do with graphics and advertising.

20090225101229AAB2YEw	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	Is a stripper pole considered to be a pornographic image?	My husband and I have a case going on with DCF because of his ex constantly calling them.  Because we have a pole in our house for exercise purposes, they are saying that we are exposing the children to pornographic images.  I DO NOT use it when they are home and I always use it wearing sweatpants and a tank top not naked.  I teach other women pole tricks to earn extra money and can bring them in to verify and prove the children are not present when I use the pole.  How do we prove it?

20090227120902AAJYXBO	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Calling all fans of 'Percy Jackson' series by Rick Riordan...?	I was wondering if you guys could help me out with my fanfiction.      As you know, from the 'Percy Jackson' series each demi-god has tributes and powers from their parent that is a god/dess.      As daughters/son of athena are wise, ares are strong and tough, hades can summon the dead, poseidon can control water etc...      I was going to make it a little different and make my main character a demi-god whose mother was selene, the moon goddess in titan's rein (golden age).      but what could a daughter of the moon goddess be like?   do you think that she might be strongest at night?   or that she would have power over water as the moon controls the tides?   or maybe she could stun people with light?   or be great at archery alike artemis, the current goddess(in the percy jackson series) of the moon and hunt?   or maybe be great at 'chilling' people out, and resolving arguements?   or maybe great at singing like a siren or musical like satyrs...      what you guys think?   which ideas would work and which wouldn't?   can you explain why?   and can you give me any additional ideas?      thanks for your help!

20090227122001AAElNOH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback on an excerpt of a play/script that i am writing?	this play/script is a spin on a semi famous japanese legend. there were two famous swordsmiths back when samurais existed, one was muramasa and the others name was masamune. muramasas blades were flawless, but he had a bloodlust and a sick and insane mind. it was said that his swords would cause the wielder to go insane and blind with rage, causing people to believe his swords were cursed. masamune on the other hand was calm. tranquil. and everything of a stereotype of discipline. his swords were said to rival that of the muramasa. the legend ended around the late 1500s. i place this story around the 1800s where a man has started murdering with a sword that was made by muramasa. he has killed hundreds. an imperialist samurai named hayate barely survived. he learned about the legend and went to a shrine where the last known masamune blade was kept (since it is said int he legend that the two blades would rival. this is where the excerpt starts as he starts talking to the shrines priest.      ps: for those who dont know, a diasho is a double sword set, a long and a short.      priest: there is no reason i should give you this blade      hayate: if i speak the name of the blade that drew this scar. drew my blood. you would speak very different words.      priest: ...muramasa...since the beginning of time, a legend has been told. a battle between all that is good. tranquil. all that is beautiful against all the darkness. pain. screams of sorrow that is still heard toda--      hayate: stop. i have not come here to listen to your poetry. each word that i speak represents another life taken by the blade of muramasa. i would very well take a stand, but like all the others who had, i would simply be cut down. i need it. to protect      priest: swords are not made to protect. they are meant to take lives.      hayate: i am here for the masamune. weather or not if you give it to me is your choice. but i do promise you, at the end it will be in my possession. it will be used to take a life. but the blood it will draw is very little to nothing compared to the red stained fields and lives already taken by the muramasa. so i stand here now asking you to make a wise choice.      priest: and if i choose to decline?      hayate: you wont. you have burdened yourself with a duty. now it is time for you to fulfill that duty.      priest: ...the masamune itself isnt strong enough to take on the muramasa.      hayate: than give me more.      priest: i will make you a daisho, along with the blade of masamune. even then however, it still will not mean anything. it will still be a simple sharpened steel used to cut through rotting flesh.      hayate: then what must i do?      priest: you must clear your mind. you must cleanse, and shower all the rage caused by the darkness away. this sword will be cut and burnt into your soul. if you are to become one with it, you cannot allow the darkness to consume you as you still draw emotional power from it. you must be in control..      hayate: i have let go of the darkness years ago.      priest: and yet you still have a long way to travel.      hayate: then i will travel with the masamune.      priest: i will see to it..that you do.      hayate: we dont have time.      priest: and yet you will wait a month as i complete the daisho.

What is your take on the style of the language? What mood does it create for you? Please critique it and tell me how you think it could improve, which parts you liked best, etc. Does it create suspense of what is being discussed?   Thanks :)      Setting: The Abbot stands in front of a table. Three aristocratic figures sit around the table facing him. It is dark. Candlesticks are aglow, white drapes are drawn behind the table. Shadows are cast on the walls.         Abbot      It is no doubt a frosty night to call upon you so   Late as it is, my noble friends.   Forgive this man whose beard comes whiter each day   Whose memory fails and falters.   Had I known a better choice, or livelier alternative   I would have died a thousand times   Turning and then burning   Than summon you here on a cold November Eve.      Yet every setting sun is but one occasion lost   A slipping chance from our unclenching fists.   How regretful!   And if conduct can be crime then so   Some acts undone are well-committed crimes   And not to act is enough treason   To incur the holy wrath.      So, let me call for your attention   Undivided and complete   As I divulge my troubles recent   Which pain my heart and tear   Me.      PAUSE      Senior A      Many troubles, Father Abbot   Have moved us to grieve, of recent   The poor are chained with heavier fetters   Of which even wild beasts are free   And the rich do not sleep soundly   Any longer, but nightmares of revolution   Rattle them in their sleep.      Senior B      True. True. Difficult times.   One cannot help but wonder   In these sweet words the poet speaks   "What troubled storms and icy winds   This Our Lady of December brings?"      A MELANCHOLIC FLURRY OF NODS   SENIOR C GETS TO HIS FEET      Senior C      When the coffers are empty, My Lords   And the spiders spin their webs   In the nooks of what were   Olden palaces, gilded stairs   And crystal chandeliers   ‘Tis then we can truly grieve.      Senior A      What do you imply?      Senior C      Let us not shed tears of fear   But lift a finger!   Are we not the pride of Salamanca?   We, skilled wizards, have   Done wonders before   Time and again   Day in and day out!   Our smiles cultivated fields   Our scowls shook the earth!   If heaven disfavours us today   Then let us act with   What little favour   She has thrown our way!      ALL BANGING ON THE TABLE (IN AGREEMENT) SENIOR C RETURNS TO HIS SEAT      Abbot      I am glad I witness this   Sure sign of fortitude   Which my noble friend expresses   In so fine a language.      Gladder, that I find us all agreed   On the course we are to take   To challenge the crises   That threaten to shake   The very foundations   Of our ancient institutions.

20090227134844AA7ZmPq	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Read my chapter 3 CRITIQUE?	I stepped into the warming sunlight of Sanderfeild and searched for my grandma. Than I realized I didn’t know what she looked like. Maybe if I could just find someone that looked a little like my mom. Than I spotted her.    She waved from were she stood; in a crowd of people at the bottom of the stairs which attached to the plane. She looked a lot like mom only her hair was a lighter shade of blonde. She seemed shorter than mom too, smaller. She was much paler, like me.   I smiled and continued down the stairs.   “Olivia, I’m so glad you decided to come” she said bringing me into a big hug.   “Me too, this will be a fun summer” hopefully.    “Now, let me take a good look at you” she took a step back “Just like your mom said, only even prettier in person”    Mom talked to her. So that’s how she knew what I looked like. I didn’t know why it mattered to me. I guess I was just expecting her to be able to take one look at me and know I was her granddaughter.   “Here let me take your bag, now lets go get the rest of your luggage” she took the bag I had slung over my shoulder and then led the way to the small airport. The Sanderfeild airport was much smaller than the Brington airport. But Brington was very large compared to Sanderfeild; who had a population of 812 people. Back home in Brington my own high school over populates this small town.      After we got my luggage, we sat down in grandma’s small car and drove to her house which was somewhere near the coast of Sanderfeild. We talked a lot on the way, about many things. How my mom is, about my school, about whether or not we should go out to dinner. And not once did she ask me about why I suddenly decided to come to Sanderfeild and meet her. Of course my answer would’ve been I don’t know   When really I’d be thinking because I wanted to meet one of the only relatives I have.   Mom never talked about her parents. I don’t know why and I won’t be asking her.    But another reason I wanted to leave was because not only did I want to get away from the life back in Brington, but I also wanted to find out more about myself. Mom never talked about her past and what better way to learn about it than to go to her mom.

20090227161538AAo0hxd	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How does my writing sound? (Begining paragraphs of a story?)?	DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that the man with his daughters are not characters in the story. Robyn Harp is the main character. This is only a prelude in someone else's point of view       A man was just about to shut the refrigerator door in the grocery store after grabbing a box of homemade pizza when his seven year old daughter asked him what he would be giving Mom for their anniversary.     “Is that coming up soon?” he asked her in return, trying to cover up his panic.    “Four days.”    “Okay,” he breathed, “well you can go down and pick out a card for her while we’re here now K?”    “But what are you getting her?” She asked, beginning to come on to him.    “I, I’m getting her a…” he was going to say something silly like “a shirt maybe” but he was cut short by his older daughter Molly running up and squeezing him from behind right above the belt.    “Dad! Guess who I saw! Over in the jewelry place! It’s so cool!” she said with excitement and almost anxiousness mixed in her face at once.     “Who?” replied the father. He didn’t want to make this a guessing game.    “Robyn Harp. She’s over there looking at necklaces with some guy.”    “Is she someone in your class?” the man said spluttering. He couldn’t believe 5th graders could be dating already; he wasn’t ready for that yet.    “In my class? Are you serious?” His daughter almost yelled with her jaw dropping. This was the stage in life when children had attitude. “ She’s famous Dad! God!”    “ What’s she done?” the father asked. “Movies, music?”    “She’s been in movies. Like, nine of them.”     “Oh.” He smiled so he could change the subject off his daughter’s celebrity fixations. “Well, tomorrow you can tell all your friends you saw a famous person in a place like Fred Meyer. It’s Los Angeles we’re living in after all.”       Molly pushed the cart into the checkout line, ignoring her Dad calling out to go into the one on her right labeled ‘Family Friendly’. From where they were standing you had the jewelry section straight ahead, and the woman in the vest behind the counter appeared to be nervously tailing two young people, a girl wearing sunglasses and her hair up with a black fedora. She peered over her shoulder and the father also noticed her lips were stained red. She did this little habit often, wincing when she noticed passerby’s pointing at her.                 “She probably doesn’t want to be asked for an autograph. Let’s just leave her alone girls.” The man told his daughters as the cashier was swiping a Crunch bar he didn’t even know he was paying for. He looked up straight ahead of him again, not being able to help himself.                Not too far behind the young starlet was a young man who looked a couple of years older than her. He too was dressed in nice attire and wearing a hat that was nearly covering his eyes. He looked as though he could have been her boyfriend, although strangely he was keeping his distance from her.                The man decided to focus on what was happening that was more important, until he saw to his left ROBYN HARP on Seventeen magazine. “Now I can see why Molly would like her. She’s only a teenager.” He thought to himself. He ought to ask his wife when they returned home if she was really a good role model for her.   When all of the pizza, toilet paper, and the birthday card for his wife had been paid for, they made their way towards the door passing Harp and the young man, with their faces towards the ground. His younger daughter had her head turned even as she kept on pushing the cart into the security door.                 “You need to be more careful with yourself Amanda.” Molly snapped at her foolish sister, although it was clear she was trying to refrain from laughing. Then she looked back again. “Did you notice how Robyn almost looked kind of scared Dad?”              “It’s probably just fear of being recognized during her everyday errands. Or maybe it’s the boy that was with her.” He sighed.           “Why the boy?” Molly asked as if that was a crazy observation.            “He’s a lot older than her. The media and society may frown upon them if they’re dating.”             “What do you mean?”             “I mean, it’s like other mothers may not want their daughters to be a fan of her if she’s doing something they don’t find role model behavior. For kids like you.”             “Well it’s none of their business what’s she’s doing. She’s still a normal person on the inside.”               “That right there Molly is a lesson many people in the Hollywood business should learn.”

Red and yellow mixed make orange, blue and yellow mixed make green, red and blue mixed make purple. But let's say you mixed a primary color together with a secondary color. For example, if you mixed blue and green, what color would you make? If you mixed blue and orange what color would you make? If you mixed yellow and green what color would you make? I already know that red and green make brown. Also, what colors would you have to mix to get a shiny creative color like gold, silver, and bronze?

20090227162041AASrdGi	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How do you pick out books to buy?	I love reading and I want to own books but I never buy them I just go to the library because like, you don't know about the book until you read it and then once you read it you don't want to buy it since you've read it unless it was super good but even then I usually dont read books more than once. The only books I own are the Twilight books because I read the first one and therefore knew I would like the others and Dreamseller because I love Brandon Novak and even if the book sucked (which it didn't it was awesome) I knew I would like to own the book.

I'm a huge fan of Poppy Z Brites work and two of my favorite books from her are from the Dell Abyss imprint "a line of sophisticated, psychological horror novels"      Apparently the line of books was short lived back in the.. 80s i believe.   Stephen king talked highly of the Abyss and me loving the books by poppy has made me want to find more books from the line.   But i can't seem to find very much info on them, at all.

20090227155525AA2xqMW	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Please read my story and comment!! Thanks for reading!?	Okay. It's a fanfic on New Moon-Edward's point of view-and it takes place right after Edward left Denali. In other words, this is the part where Edward was in Denali at Tanya's house. Please do help me edit. I could send the whole story to you if you want.      I was at the little meadow behind her house, thinking about Bella. I missed her dreadfully, even when I only left for a day.   “Thinking of Bella again?” Alice asked promptly.   I nodded and looked up into the sky.   “I bet she was heartbroken like you,” she complained. She missed Bella too.   I wanted to shout at Alice to gain some relief. In the end, I said a few very long sentences.   “Alice, I miss Bella so much… It was as if I’m in hell since yesterday. The pain of leaving her…it was unbearable, Alice. I miss Bella. I want her back. I…I…I want Bella to be with me, forever. You knew that Alice. It just so happened that I’m a danger to her. I only wanted to be with Bella…” The words came out like a river, no, like an ocean. Alice was quiet, too.   She was my best friend too, Edward. You’re not the only one missing her. She looked sad, like me.   Alice gave me a very tight hug. I hugged her back.   “Let’s keep Bella at the most bottom of our hearts,” I whispered.   “Yes. Let’s,” Alice whispered, too.   It was wrong to hurt the people I loved like this. Although I think it was a right decision to make, and yet I hurt so many people already. I began to suspect that I made a wrong decision.   “Are you okay, Alice?” I asked.   No I’m not, but never mind. I could withstand it, she soothed me.   “We shouldn’t be thinking about Bella anymore. Don’t worry, I wouldn’t peep into her window and watch her sleep,” I said.   Alice nodded lightly.   “But she would try to kill herself or something, we-” she said.   “Bella promised,” I said slowly. “Don’t be looking for her future, either,” I continued. “We’ve done enough damage.”   I don’t want Alice to come and tell me that Bella started a new life and had a new boyfriend. I wouldn’t – and I couldn’t – accept that fact.   “Oh well,” Alice sighed. “I guess that’s true.” Don’t worry; I won’t do anything stupid like you.   I was sad enough not to reply to her thoughts. She ignored me and went on.   I am so attuned to her, I couldn’t say anything like “yes, I wouldn’t look into her future.” Her future comes to me. I don’t need to look for it. She cried.   “That’s so unbearable,” I muttered to myself.   Edward, you better think positive now. Thinking about all sorts of nonsense wouldn’t help, you know, she shouted at me.   “Why am I even a vampire,” I continued mumbling to myself.   Edward, ENOUGH, you moron. You’re telling the whole world not to think about Bella and now you’re thinking about her! Stop it! Now! Her thoughts were as loud as thunder.   “I wanted to stop, but I couldn’t…” I mumbled to myself again.   What if Bella died? Alice asked furiously.   My eyes lit up in horror.   “Alice, how could you…” I cried.   You haven’t answered my question yet. What if Bella died?   “I don’t know!” I complained. “I’ll go die, too, I will, I swear.” I said.   Stupid, sick love.   “I don’t care. I’m leaving now. So goodbye,” Alice said silently. She then mumbled something like “stupid Edward”.   I lied down in the meadow and stared up into the sky. The stars were gone today. All that’s left was the darkness, not even the moon was in sight. It was exactly what I felt now, dark and lonely, without any support.   I heard light footsteps coming towards me. I pounced up immediately, surprised to see Tanya looking at me.   “Edward, you’ve been such a fool,” she exclaimed. “Alice told me everything.”   “That’s her own opinion,” I stated carefully.   “Let me tell you a story,” she said very calmly. She lied down on the tender grass, looking into the sky. I lied down beside her, wondering what she was trying to say.   She begins her story when I settled down.   “I was in love with a human before, too,” she started. “We were in love with each other. I never told him I was a vampire.” she stopped, waiting for my response.   “Then,” I asked, eager to know the next part of the story.   “One day, I bit him accidentally because I haven’t hunted in a long time,” she paused. “I pulled away immediately, but he knew I was a vampire. He never hated me, but he loved me more instead.” I wandered what was the relevance between her case and my case.   “So what?” I said.   “You should listen to the rest of the story,” she explained. “So I pulled away. But from that moment onwards I knew that vampires and humans couldn’t be together.”   Finally, somebody who supported me.   “But,” she continued. “I did not leave him. He…One day, I bit him again. But this time, I sucked all the blood out of him…” she trailed off.   “Sorry that you have to tell me that story,” I apologized.   “I let it down, unlike you. You should learn not to blame yourself on everything. I let it go, because it was my nature. I suck blood, and I killed the one I loved for it. I let it go, because his blood stayed in me,” she said

20090227161854AA1o9Ab	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Some Shakespear translation help? 10 pts for the first one?	I understand it but only a little bit...its the famous "to be or not to be"...what i want is for it to be put in simpler words, ones we use today. i need this because i am going to be reciting it and i want to know what it means exactly so that I can deliver it better. thanks so much...p.s. line by line please, thanks   To be, or not to be : that is the question:    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;    No more; and by a sleep to say we end    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks    That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;    To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,    Must give us pause: there's the respect    That makes calamity of so long life;    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,    The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,    The insolence of office and the spurns    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,    When he himself might his quietus make    With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,    But that the dread of something after death,    The undiscover'd country from whose bourn    No traveller returns, puzzles the will    And makes us rather bear those ills we have    Than fly to others that we know not of?    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;    And thus the native hue of resolution    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,    And enterprises of great pith and moment    With this regard their currents turn awry,    And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!    The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons    Be all my sins remember'd.

Women workers in Petrograd marched in protest, then     organized a general strike.   learned to bake bread.   consulted with Rasputin.   joined the czar's army.      3.   Outwardly, Lenin turned over power to the all-Russian Congress of Soviets, then     invaded Poland with a mercenary army of peasants.   signed a peace treaty with the czar and became deputy czar.   passed real power to a Council of People's Commissars that he controlled.   retired from politics and settled in the Ukraine.      4.   Military opposition or other forms of challenges to the Red Army came from all of the following EXCEPT     Siberian anti-Communists.   Italian royalists who supported Lenin.   Allied material aid to the anti-Communists.   the Ukrainians.      5.   Kerensky's provisional government made the fatal mistake of deciding to     continue the war.   sign a peace treaty with Germany.   assassinate the czar.   continue the 300-year-old Romanov dynasty.

20090227161020AAbS8L1	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What would you do if you discovered everything you know now was an illusion?	Now obviously most of what we perceive as reality is an illusion to a certain sense, at least here in High School. Too frequently people are caught up in what they think is the "now" when their focus remains upon things that were never meant to be anything more than the past. The minor details they take into account: Boyfriend issues, celebrities, etc. But what if life was, by literal translation, an illusion?      Consider both of the following:   1) You awake to find that you are an "alien" and that your life as a human was all just a figment of an overly active, extra terrestrial imagination. There is no such thing as human. Also, in dreams the most ridiculous things can seem rational. What if you discovered mathematics, literature, science and all of the other subjects were really composed of a bunch of gibberish? Having finally awakened, you recognize that the whole ordeal was a vivid nightmare/hallucination. What is your initial reaction?      Or, option number two:   2) You snap out of this reality to discover you are in a mental institution and life is entirely different from what you believed. Nothing you remember (the 9/11, who was elected president, wars…) actually occurred so you cannot pretend to be psychic either.      Consider carefully on both, give good responses. The best will be selected.

20090227160054AAc1PpI	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Guitar Modeler powering a Cabinet Amp?	I have a POD 2.0 Guitar Modeler with a small amp and I am planning to upgrade. I really don't want to buy a combo amp because that basically defeats the purpose of my POD 2.0 because it has the same effects as it. Also because that would be a waste of $200 for the POD 2.0.       So I was wondering, can my POD 2.0 just power a Cabinet itself instead of needing a power amp's emulated line out or instead of having to buy a head?      On the website it says this about their product:   "Other tuning modes allow POD to be optimized for connection to the power amp input of a closed-back system, or into closed-back cabinets. "

20090227155934AAyoZhR	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Twilight vs Salem's Lot?	I have read both books. I prefer Stephen King's book over Stephanie Meyers. Salem's Lot had a more believable vampire and how the characters approached the situation with more skepticism unlike Twilight. Twilight was adequate. It got rather cheesy and I didn't how Stephanie Meyer abused the Thesaurus and had a low vocab use. Also she made a few grammar errors. Those can be over looked. But the books are too different to really compare. So I'm asking you. Which book did you like better and why. If you didn't like one of the books then please state why. And for Twilight fan girls, don't give an answer like: EDWARD IS HOT!. Give a real reason why you liked the book. Although I like Stephen King allot, My favorite Author is Robert Jordan. I started his series The Wheel of Time. As of now I am on the third book The Dragon Reborn.

I was remembering a book that I had read and loved when I was young, but I'd forgotten about for years and years. It's been bothering me that I can't remember what the name of it was, so I was wondering if someone could help me out.       The plot is fuzzy, but I can remember these little details that stuck with me. There was a girl in a red bathing suit was afraid of diving off the high diving board at the pool. She used to build these really intricate designs in the sand, like a replica of the pool itself complete with diving board and all. There was a silver cat with a bell that used to appear to her, but I can't remember why. I seem to remember at the end of the book, she saw the cat on her porch at night and ran out to see it, when she saw a visage of the cat in the stars.       Something like that, in any case. I just remember loving it so much and I really wish I could remember the storyline better or even just the name of it. Does it ring any bells with anyone?

Deliberate thrusts sent   men to ground,    on grassy knolls,   within castle walls.   Chivalry.      Armies met for    Combat.   Announcing their arrival    bugles, and   thundering drums    at designated fields.   Conquered false beliefs   with flag as armor.   Honor      Meet me out back, chump.   Strained faces   inciting words.   through clenched teeth   caught by flying fists   as   boys became men   from crushing blows.   Bravery      Progress?

20090227162510AAzAtF0	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How would you improve my "Small Town Serenade"?	“Small Town Serenade”   By Peter Benoit         Ah, one red light! You blink and it is gone   The once familiar stores with cheerful lights   That cast a glow on dreary nights   Are dark and sad with shutters drawn —   Their hour has come too soon.   Where there were cobbles once, and carriages   And loving households and good marriages   Are sights that a wise man disparages —   Of winos limp on lampposts ‘neath a slivered moon.      The friendly greetings, genuine concern,   Impromptu meetings where we’d swap a tale   Down by the depot of the rail   Are gone for good, and won’t return —   Their time was far too brief.   Gone too are schoolboys playing sandlot ball,   And children’s voices echoed in a hall,   Or daydreaming for long hours on a wall —   Time took them all; I miss them yet there’s no relief.      The yards all manicured and neatly clipped,   The genteel parlors dressed in tatted lace   Are tattered now, and in their place   Discolored china cracked and chipped —   The world’s an unmown lawn.   I wish the life I had could sit and stay   A while, that it had never gone away,   I took for granted each and every day —   One light could not stop time.  You blink and it is gone.

It does not be still,                   in hand or flask      much like the stain of pain,         it's salty pool never existed       so ask humbly...         are we dead before living...              or are we living before death?

20090227170428AAtG1Mp	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?  Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotist?	What are some philosophical reasons not to commit suicide?      Sociobiology teaches that a certain set of egotistical, selfish values remain with us from antiquity and will continue to be cavemen. Certainly the insanity of this Second Great Depression seems to confirm the selfish war of all against war that hides behind the facade of law, civilization and morality.      How can the infinite pains of life be justified in comparison to the calm serenity of nonexistence? Has any man in history lived a life so blessed as to outweigh the pleasures of endless dreamless sleep? Is not man's greatest sin to have been born? What duty is there to continue to live? We did not choose to be born.      Why pass on genes, and sentence another generation to hell for the selfish pleasure of sexual desire?      Schopenhauer said we were in the worst of all possible worlds. If any worst it could not exist as mass suicide would follow. Instead an irrational will to live which we could not control forces us to go on with our wretched lives until we commit the sin of parenthood and sentence another generation to the hell of existance. Sex is the tool the WIll uses to ensure the survival of this hell.      So if there is no rational reason for living, and if one rejects the values of sociobiology and the times, then what is the philsophical argument against suicide?

When home is gone    Lying in the same sheets, surrounded by the same furniture as always I wiped away my black tears before they hit the pillow. I had forgotten to remove my make up before and now mascara was smudged all down my face. I had managed to put on a brave face for the family earlier as I had most days as being unhappy about the move, or just being unhappy in general had been frowned on in the house and all problems were pushed under the subject of ’teen anxiety’ to be forgotten but now I was alone it was to much to hold in.    The day had been  a stressful blur of boxes and removal men. The new room was bigger than my last but was poorly decorated with blank colourless walls and a tired light green carpet. The old familiar sound of the sea I was used to hearing at night was now replaced with the sound of cars driving past my window. trying to remember my old home and life I closed my eyes tight and pressed play to the sadist song on my ipod.

All of my life I dreamed of meeting one   with immense beauty, and once I found her   I would charm her and she'd be mine forever      I have found her and indeed she is all   I wished for and more but she is   not charmed nor intrigued. Then I   think 2 myself "What can I offer her?"   The tears warm my eyes and blur my   vision. I stick 2 my stance of bravado   and give her the same uninterested look   she gave me. She was so beautiful   But what can I offer her.      -Tupac Shakur
