Anyway, they were drunk and cursing constantly and annoying the hell out of everyone on the train. Finally one guy who was around 5'6? told them to keep quiet. Instead of taking his advice they walked up to hit and started putting their hands in his face screaming and threatening him constantly. He told them to **** off after a few minutes and they began slapping him. No one else didn't anything to stop him because people thought it was funny. After a couple seconds of taking their hits the train made its stop and he swung and both of them knocking both of them to the ground and giving one of them a bloody lip. He was really just defending himself, but he was he wrong? He was trying to restrain them at first, but they kept swinging. What do you guys think?

Back track all the major companies that hold preferred shares and the answer will show itself.      After checking it out for yourself. answer my question.
