NIyyDwNVaa	Recombinant DNA is DNA fragments cleaved by restriction enzymes. essentially DNA has been recombined artifically.<br>  <br>  Recombinant DNA would have sticky ends which can be inserted into a plasmid which then can be incorporated into bacteria which then can replicate and produce whatever protein or effect is produced by the recombinant DNA.<br>  <br>  I'm not an expert but the important thing is that when restriction enzymes cleave DNA unevenly leaving hanging overends which can then be inserted into a plasmid that might've been cleaved by the same restriction enzyme.<br>  <br>  here's an example<br>  CCCCCCCCCCCC  GGATCC  AAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>  GGGGGGGGGGGG  CCTAGG  TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br>  <br>  If that is part of the double stranded DNA<br>  <br>  If you cleave this<br>  CCCCCCCCCCC<br>  GGGGGGGGGGG CCTAGG<br>  <br>  GGATCC AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<br>  ------------TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT<br>  <br>  Do you see the overhangs. Well restriction enzymes cleave specific sequences just like that. And so when you mix the DNA with plasmid that has been cut I think the DNA will hybridize with the plasmid. Because if the DNA and plasmid was cleaved by the same restriction enzyme than it probably has complementary overhangs because sequences are specific

NSQaDOhYaa	Assume the hole is drilled vertically through the centre O of the sphere which forms the origin of the coordinate system. The height h is measured along the vertical axis. The central cylinder of material which is drilled out will have a cross-sectional area of πa2 and height h given by Pythagoras<br>  <br>  h2 = (2.a)2 - a2 or h = ±√3.a<br>  <br>  Cylinder volume = 2√3.π.a3<br>  <br>  To this we must add the volume of the two slices of the sphere at the top and bottom of the cylinder. Using the same coordinate system, an annulus at height h above the origin has radius √[(2.a)2 - h2] and hence an area of π.[(2.a)2 - h2]. The volume of one slice is obtained by integrating over h between the limits √3.a and 2.a<br>  <br>  π.∫ (4.a2 - h2).dh = π.(4.a2.h - h3/3) = π.[(8.a3 - 8.a3/3) - (4.√3.a3 - √3.a3)]<br>  <br>  = π.[(16.a3/3) - 3√3.a3]<br>  <br>  So the total volume drilled out is that for the cylinder above and for two of the slices <br>  <br>  Volume cut out = 2.π.[(16/3) - 2√3].a3<br>  <br>  Note added: The result can be obtained more simply using a little-known result discussed in this forum some weeks ago (see reference below). This states that the volume of a sphere (radius unspecified!) with a circular hole of length 2.h through the centre has a residual volume of (4/3)π.h3. In this case h = √3.a and the volume of the original sphere was (4/3)π.(2.a)3, enabling the volume of cut material to be obtained by subtracting these two volumes.

YpUhEviCaa	In evolutionary biology, homology refers to any similarity between characteristics that is due to their shared ancestry. The word homologous derives from the ancient Greek ομολογειν, 'to agree'. There are examples in different branches of biology. Anatomical structures that perform the same function in different biological species and evolved from the same structure in some ancestor species are homologous. In genetics, homology can be observed in DNA sequences that code for proteins (genes) and in noncoding DNA. For protein coding genes, one can compare translated amino-acid sequences of different genes. Sequence homology may also indicate common function. Homologous chromosomes are chromosomes with the same genes, but non-identical nucleotide sequences that can pair (synapse) during meiosis, and are believed to share common ancestry.

NIyyDwNVaa	Enthalpy is a thermodynamic state function that describes (in quantity) changes in heat under constant pressure.<br>  <br>  This is really neat because most reactions usually occur understand constant pressure because everyday we experience atmospheric pressure conditions which don't fluctuate wildly.<br>  <br>  Enthalpy is a state function which means that it is only dependent on change between initial and final state.  That means' the reaction doesn't matter. Enthalpy change is what's important.<br>  <br>  Enthalpy is calculated by the difference between enthalpy of products and enthalpy of reactants<br>  <br>  From enthalpy you can determine whether you're reaction releases heat (exothermic) or if it absorbs heat (endothermic). Exothermic is denoted by a negative enthalpy and Endothermic is denoted by a positive enthalpy.<br>  <br>  Usually it is impossible to calculate enthalpy directly. However a change in enthalpy in reactions can be measured.<br>  <br>  Change in enthalpy for a reaction = (sum of the products' standard heat of formation - sum of the reactants' standard heat of formation)<br>  <br>  Standard heat of formation (H(f)) is just the enthalpy change which would occur if 1 mol of the compound is formed from its elements.|`|9P2yKjOQaa	heat  energy|`|0Fkao56taa	In thermodynamics and molecular chemistry, the enthalpy (denoted as H, h, or rarely as χ) is a quotient or description of thermodynamic potential of a system, which can be used to calculate the heat transfer during a quasistatic process taking place in a closed thermodynamic system under constant pressure.<br>  <br>  The term enthalpy was composed of the prefix en-, meaning "to put into" and the Greek word -thalpein, meaning "to heat", although the original definition is thought to have stemmed from the word "enthalpos"|`|Mkv968graa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy</a>|`|wLLtWGWBaa	its symbol is deltaH<br>  and it is (-) if the reaction is exothermic cause it releases heat<br>  and its (+) if its endothermic because you absorb heat|`|I1XIi8syaa	google it|`|h6GEvhBqaa	Enthalpy can be thought of  as the degree of disorganization of a system.

For a chemist, this is disorganization. The atoms have more room to jump around. A gas has an even higher enthalpy. It's rare to see something go from gas to ice under normal conditions (deposition) because that decreases it's enthalpy. I hope this helps!

AA10267328	Separation by steam distillation is only possible if one of the components forms an azeotrope with water.   It is also theoretically possible if both do but only if the azeotropes boil very far apart.   Generally speaking, it is only practical if only one of the components forms an azeotrope with water.  We did some of these steam distillations on a large scale when I worked in industry.   Unless there is something special about one of the components not forming an azeotrope, you will not get significant separation.

I cannot for the life of me figure out what you're asking, but I'll try:<br>  <br>  A black hole is what happens when any mass becomes so dense that it overcomes the repulsive nuclear forces and becomes compressed into zero volume, thereby being infinitely dense.  Most black holes are several kilometers in size, whereas the larger ones can be hundreds of kilometers across.  As for its color, a black hole has none.  It gets its name from the fact that light cannot escape its gravitational pull, and therefore I suppose it would indeed look black.  It would also warp the image around it.<br>  <br>  When an object approaches a black hole, the force of gravity increases according to the inverse square of the distance; if you're half as far away it'll pull you four times as hard, for example.  Eventually, the object's size becomes an issue as one end is pulled harder than the other, thus ripping it apart.  All of it is funneled into the singularity (the black hole proper), where it is incorporated into its mass.  A black hole slowly radiates its mass via Hawking radiation, a steady stream of random particles, but it takes longer than the age of the universe for large black holes to evaporate.<br>  <br>  Ah!  I finally figured out what the question is.  To put it simply, it's not a black sphere so much as it's a sphere that only looks black; it isn't really there and if you get close it would do some weird stuff.  <br>  Yes, gravity makes it go in.  <br>  Matter sent into a black hole is compressed into a volume of zero, and falls into the singularity once it's finished orbiting.  This can take a while, but the temporal effects of time dilation within the event horizon (the point of no return) are far too complex to explain here.<br>  Any time you hear the phrase "another dimension," it's bull, plain and simple.  That's not what dimensions are.|`|m09snBrEaa	gravity naturally pulls things into spheres so long as their massive enough(planets stars and the a fore mentioned black holes)<br>  <br>  black holes go away but the larger they are the longer it takes for them to "evaporate" the black holes people fear of being created in the LHC, even if they are created, would be so small that they would fall apart in a fraction of a second.<br>  <br>  the stuff is still there, but its crushed under extreme pressure.<br>  <br>  also the blackness of a black hole comes from the fact that the escape velocity, the speed needed to overcome its gravity, is above the speed of light, so no light can reflect off of it.<br>  <br>  this mp3 file talks about the in's and outs of black holes: <a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/astronomycast/AstroCast-070107.mp3" rel="nofollow">http://media.libsyn.com/media/astronomyc...</a>|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Stephen Hawking is the best on this subject.

AA10335036	No. The charged object will attract charge carriers of the opposite polarity in an uncharged conductor. These charges will collect on the near side of the conductor but leave charges of the same polarity on the opposite side. Thus the conductor remains neutral overall, but a net attraction exists. The same effect occurs in an uncharged insulator except the charge mobility is on a smaller scale (atomic rather than body-sized) so the effect will be smaller but still present.

"In nature bacteria often grow as colonies on surfaces. Observation of colony development and morphology has for many years been an important tool for identification and characterization of bacteria because individual species often form colonies of characteristic size and appearance. However, even when a pure bacterial culture is plated out, different morphological colony types often arise. Traditionally, the colony morphology of Escherichia coli is identified as either a rough or a smooth form. The two forms are readily distinguished, as the colonies of the former are rough, flat, and irregular and colonies of the latter are smooth, high, and circular."

There are many series that sum to something involving π. Just take enough terms of any of those series to obtain a sufficiently good approximation of π. For example, arctan(1) = π/4, and the series expansion is 1 -1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ..., so you can approximate π from there.

It normally happens in apartment buildings because in reality...or at least in the entities reality, it is actually one place. Apartments and hotels are like beehives for people. It is really one unit with a lot of cells...metaphorically speaking.<br>  <br>  Let's say a person on the first floor was into some dark magick or was communicating with negative entities...most likely, the people who live above them and those who live on either side, are going to start experiencing some strange activity in their own places. Mostly though, those other people would be experiencing the negative energy residue and not the actual entities...most of the time.<br>  <br>  Your neighbors would have to be into some really heavy dark sh*t in order to "infest" the entire building. <br>  <br>  We all have guardians that watch over us and by being a good person and doing good things, you are creating a protective barrier for yourself. Also, keeping your home free and clear of clutter makes your spot less attractive to negative entities and negativity. Negative entities like chaos, negativity, mess and stagnancy...it attracts them. <br>  <br>  There are other things that you can do, such as smudging your place on a regular basis. Having lots of plants helps and making sure that your place gets lots of fresh air flow basically makes your home welcoming to positivity and repelling to negativity. <br>  <br>  BTW, negative entities are different than ghosts. They are not bound to one place, they are not lost and they were never living human beings. The things that prevent them from traveling wherever they like are Divine beings, purposeful protection put in place...and other positivity related things.|`|500d6fc36eb98b82443dc02f01ab5214aa	If that happens, there is one think that does work if your able to control it.

Several years ago some highly perceptive people along with members of our ESP group were having a Ouija board spiritual encounter. One of the group began playing in the munchies making an image of what appeared to be a giant Madagascar cockroach. At the very moment 'giant roach' was spelled out on the Ouija board. You could imagine this was undoubtedly thought of as some kind of sign. It nearly hit everyone at the same time. Soon it felt like smoke was shrouding the room. I remember a kind of bubbling noise I thought perhaps it was what the roach spiritual world communicating to us. Then someone said take a deep breath and some kinda of bong device was passed. It all seemed so weird like none of it made sense. What did all this have to do with roaches. Then they said they were sacrificing roaches that they were in the gong or bong what ever it was. I wanted to leave but many of them were neighbors and I didn't want a spiritual negligence lawsuit filed against me. I stayed and I will tell you this before I left I was so hungry I ate that giant Madagascar cockroach and anything else I could get my hands on.

You have to be sure that you have completed the dehydtation or evaporation. So after some time of heating/cooling you weigh the sample. Record the mass. Repeat the heating/cooling. Weigh the the sample. Now if the second mass is smaller than the first mass, you have to do the cycle again. It indicates to you that when the first sample was weighed it still contained some solvent or water. Can you see the error that would have been caused if you had merely accepted the first mass? After the third weighing you should have the second and third mass equal to within a few mg. This is called drying to constant mass. You can now accept the third mass as the final mass. Some solvents and hydrated salts are very stubborn and it may take a few cyles to reach a constant mass. But working to constsnt mass is a requirement of all gravimetric analyses.

ossCVxPqaa	By and large, the solubity of compounds increases with increase in temperature. A saturated solution is one where more solute is added than can be dissolved at that temperature. If you have a saturated solution at 20°C, then heating the solution may result in the excess dissolving, as long as so much excess is not added so as to exceed the solubility at the higher temperature. <br>  If you make a saturated solution at 80°C and decant the solution, as it cools down the solute will start to saturate out of the solution. This is how crystals are grown.

You can expect that around 75% will get bred on the first try, so 25% will need two straws. The approximately 5% that miss on the second breeding are run with a bull. We figure that we need 1.25 straws per cows, on the average. I would guess that dairy breeders would be similar, except that most would be likely to breed AI a third time and not use a bull, or use a beef bull.|`|1l8KBXsbaa	In beef cattle, you hope for one straw per cow. However, about 20% of cows (depending on cow breed and AI technician) wont settle and will need to be AI'ed again, or turned out with a bull. Dairy cattle, however, have been selected so heavily for milking qualities that they are reproductively poorer than beef cattle and will very often not stick the first time and need to be bred again. Another variation is in collecting embryos. If you plan on collecting embryos from a cow, you will have her shed multiple eggs at once and therefor may use 3 or 4 straws at a time to compensate.|`|61mSBfrSaa	You usually only use one straw per breeding.

How difficult is it for life to come into existence out of non-life.<br>  2. How unique is the Earth's environment and its environmental history in the universe and how necessary was that environmental history to the development of intelligent life (man).<br>  <br>  The first question addresses whether, given the right environment, would it be likely that life would start up anywhere?  We suspect that the answer to that question is: Very Likely.  The reason is that the more we look around the universe the more precursors to life we find.  The more we look around the Earth the more we find evidence that life on the Earth happened very soon after the Earth was created (geologically speaking).  The question of life elsewhere in our solar system is probably the most important question that all of our space exploration is aimed at answering.  We have not found any slam-dunk evidence for life elsewhere but we continue to find places where it could have developed and we continue to look.<br>  <br>  The second question addresses the nurturing of primitive life into complex organisms.  On Earth (our only example of life we currently have) it took over 3.5 billion years to come up with man; three and a half billion years where the environment on the Earth was relatively stable.  For about 3 billion of those years life was mostly single celled.  During this immense time period the environment on Earth was favorable to the continued development of life even in the face of a drastically changing solar environment.  Is it likely that such a planet would exist elsewhere in the universe?  The numbers of stars are staggering so it might seem a virtual certainty that there are “Earth-like Planets” elsewhere in the universe.   Consider this: the Earth has developed life and as far as we currently know Mars and Venus have not.  They are Earth-like planets - very similar planets to the Earth.  The answer must be more complicated than just “Earth-like planets.”<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider: our sun, Sol, has over the last 4 billion years increased its output by about 25% due to normal stellar evolution.  That is an enormous change in output and without some compensating factor the Earth, over that time period, would have gone from an ice ball to a barren Venus like planet.  It didn't- but we don't know what the factor or factors were that maintained such a constant environment.  It is highly unlikely that another “Earth-Like Planet” would have a continuously nurturing environment over a multi-billion year span.<br>  <br>  Now consider the likelihood of the Earth receiving visits from aliens.  The chances of alien life forms visiting us come down to three additional questions.  One addresses the spatial problem and one the temporal problem.  The third addresses actual travel possibilities.<br>  <br>  1. If a technologically sophisticated life form did develop elsewhere in the universe would it be likely that they would be contemporaneous with man when he is also technologically sophisticated. <br>  2. Is it likely that a technologically sophisticated life form could develop near enough to us so that they could reasonably visit the Earth?<br>  3. Does there really exist a “new physics” that would allow travel over immense distances in reasonable times?<br>  <br>  When alien extraterrestrial life is considered what we usually referred to is: technologically sophisticated life.  We aren’t usually talking about bacteria or worms or even Homo Erectus visiting the Earth.  Humans have been technologically sophisticated for only about 100 years with radio communications and rockets. Our first satellite to orbit another body was only 42 years ago. That is 100 years out of a total history for the Solar System of 4,500,000,000 years and of 13,500,000,000 years for the universe.  The chances of a second life form becoming technologically sophisticated and also overlapping in time with man- also being technologically sophisticated seem vanishing small.  Alien civilizations may have come into being, developed and become extinct hundreds of millions of years before or after Earth’s man became technologically sophisticated.<br>  <br>  The problem of travel is also daunting.  With all of our present sophistication we do not have the ability to travel to even the nearest star.  The development of super-sophisticated intelligent extraterrestrial life capable of traveling to nearby stars would first require a nurturing environment existing for billions of years and then the development of science and technology far beyond ours. Put all together- that in itself is very, very, very unlikely.  For intelligent life to happen a second time NEAR enough to our star, Sol, so travel would be possible is also vanishingly small.  In talking about alien visitors to Earth there is an implied uncovering of a ‘new physics’ that would allow what our present physics does not allow- travel over large distances in reasonable time frames.  It may be that that physics actually does NOT exist.  If you indulge in new physics then you are opening yourself up to creating a fantasy world that may not exist in reality<br>  <br>  Man presently might have the technology and ability to send a man to Neptune.  At the speed of 50,000 miles per hour we would need to provide life support to the astronauts for several years.  It would take 6.4 years at 50,000 mph to go to Neptune – one way.  Now consider the NEAREST star.  At a speed of 1,000,000 miles per hour it would take 2,885 years just to get there AND that is only to the nearest star!<br>  <br>  Unless there really is a new physics unknown to man there is essentially no way for aliens to visit the Earth or for Earthlings to visit any other star.  If you accept physics as we know it- then there are too few nearby stars for there to be a high probability for the development of technologically sophisticated life forms.  <br>  <br>  Consider this: if the sun were about the size of a golf ball, 1 inch in diameter, the closest approach between Earth and Mars would be about four and a half feet and the orbit of Neptune would be 300 feet away.  At that scale the NEAREST star would be 461 MILES away.|`|xDPQ700baa	Lets face it, if I was an alien I wouldn't worry about putting bits back, you would be in the pie with the rest of the meat after an examination.<br>  <br>  So no, fanciful mumbo methinks.

Seriously. They could cross enormous distances but they can't study us from a far? No.|`|g3Uogm7Haa	I'd first like to compliment David D on his answer.  It was well written and well thought out.  However, I have a few thoughts that may conflict with his conclusions.<br>  <br>  The universe is incredibly large.  It is bigger than our human brains are capable of comprehending.  Now, we know how difficult it is to create life as we know it on an earth-like planet.  We've yet to find anything remotely close.  However, given the fact that it DID happen on earth, and given the fact that the universe is so incredibly large, I have to believe that life exists elsewhere.  I've read that the Big Bang, which is the birth of the universe, occurred approximately 13.85 billion years ago.  The Earth may only be 4.6 billion years old.  Now, given the vast difference in age between Earth and the universe, it is possible that there are civilizations out there who are much more advanced than we were because they've had a 9 BILLION year head start on us.  Think about how far we've grown in just the past One HUNDRED years.  If that holds true, then the possibility exists that they would be capable of travelling in some form to our planet.<br>  <br>  Now, your question asked if I think it's true that people are abducted by aliens.  I truly believe that SOMETHING is happening.  One can argue against my belief and ask:  "Where is the proof?"  I believe the proof is in the experience.  So many people, for so many years, have had similar experiences.  We do not have a smoking gun, but proof is all around us.  There are references in the bible to chariots of fire in the sky and a burning bush that was on fire but did not burn (artificial light).  The Egyptians had heiroglyphics depicting beings in aircrafts.  Several paintings throughout history have depicted space craft in the background before the concept of human flight even existed.  The list can go on.  My point is, there are references right under our noses throughout time of an advanced technology among us, but society has forced us to dismiss it as folklore, lies, or 'crazy talk.'  Is it?<br>  <br>  As for actual abductions, so many people have reported similar experiences.  Now, I will agree that some of those stories were probably influenced by movies and popular culture.  But all of them were not.  What about the young child who tells his parents of beings visiting him at night and doing things to him that he should have no knowledge of?  Or the pictures he draws of beings with large eyes?  These children have no knowledge of those movies and books.  If the children are honestly reporting what they are experiencing, then it is highly possible there is truth behind what the adult population is saying as well.  <br>  <br>  If this holds true, if abductions really are occurring, the question is raised as to who the abductors are and where are they coming from. We've already discussed the theory of beings coming from another planet.  But what if these beings are just as terresterial as we are?  75% of this earth is ocean, and we have yet to explore their vastness.  The Discovery Channel is frequently running specials on USO's (Unidentified Submerged Objects).  The US Government has many documented encounters with craft that fly through the sky and then disappear under the ocean without a trace, performing maneuvers that do not exist for human technology.  I recommend catching one of these episods if you get the chance.  <br>  <br>  Another aspect I'd like to mention is the spiritual aspect of an abduction.  These beings have the capability to contact us in a dream-like state.  It is similar to an out of body experience induced by the abductors.  Now, if this holds true, a being would not need technology to traverse the universe or ocean.  Humans have already documented our ability to astrally project.  Whose to say a more advanced race can't do it too?<br>  <br>  So, although the universe is so incredibly large, we've mentioned two other possible answers as to where these beings may be coming from and their methods of travel.  We've identified, from an investigative standpoint, ways to corroborate statements made by abductees and also noted their historical presence dating as far back as Genesis.  In answer to your question, I would say YES, I do believe there is truth behind the stories that people tell.  The challenging is weeding through the lies, deceit, and fiction to get to the truth.<br>  <br>  I run a group on Yahoo called TruthSeikers.

It's not so important for shorter structures, like culverts, but if longer bridges were not allowed to expand, the forces would build to a point where the bridge could be damaged.<br>  <br>  New bridges are built on rubbery elastomeric bearing pads instead of rockers, partly because the bridge is less likely to get knocked off its rocker during an earthquake or similar event.

GASTNilgaa	The explanation that comes most readily to mind would be to give an explanation how the values of a function (any function) can be recovered from the values of its Laplace transform.  (In other words, to prove that the Laplace transform is injective by exhibiting a formula that gives a left inverse to it).  <br>  <br>  For the question you're asking, the specifics are not very important--- and you can find them in a textbook, or on the web--- the basic idea is that if f is a function and L its laplace transform, then for any t you can recover f(t) as the integral of a certain function (depending on t), times L, over a set in the complex plane (you have some choice about what this set is).  So if L is zero everywhere, then for any t, the value f(t) is the integral of 0 over some set, and hence 0 for all t.<br>  <br>  I cannot think of an "abstract" way of seeing that the Laplace transform is injective; I think you really do need to work with its definition explicitly to provide an explicit formula.  (If you already knew that the Fourier transform is injective, you could get injectivity of the Laplace transform out of that, provided you had a formula relating the two transforms.)  Sooner or later you have to deal with actual formulas.  You can find some on the pages below
gReXjl6Kaa	In brief: since vanadium is electron-poor, it can only takes part in coordination bonds as a Lewis acid (electron pair acceptor).<br>  <br>  <br>  Firstly, metallic vanadium has the electronic configuration [Ar]4s23d3, so compounds of vanadium are relatively electron-poor. Consequently, most binary compounds are Lewis acids (electron pair acceptors); examples are all the halides forming octahedral adducts with the formula VXnL6-n (X = halide; L = other ligand). <br>  <br>  Secondly, the vanadium ion is rather large and can achieve coordination numbers higher than 6, as is the case in [V(CN)7]4?. Thirdly, the vanadyl ion, VO2+, is featured in many complexes of vanadium(IV) such as vanadyl acetylacetonate (V(=O)(acac)2). In this complex, the vanadium is 5-coordinate, square pyramidal, meaning that a sixth ligand, such as pyridine, may be attached, though the association constant of this process is small.|`|fHR8FMp8aa	Vanadium is in group Va of the periodic table so should have a maximum valency of 5 in which it acts as an acid anhydride, Vanadium pentoxide.

3LAgaDzXaa	The question does seem confusing, because you would expect a point on the sphere to have an x, y, AND z coordinate, not just x and y.  However, the sphere is x^2 + y^2 +z^2 = 1 so if you know x and y you have z up to a + or - sign.<br>  <br>  Remember, meridians are great circles passing though the North and South poles.  So this problem is saying that if you project a meridian onto the plane that passing through the equator (the complex plane), projecting from the North pole of the sphere as if you had a light there and the shadow of the meridian were the projection, the result would be a straight line through the origin on the complex plane, having the same angle as the meridian had (wrt say the prime or zero meridian).  Intuitively this is totally obvious, but you need a proof.<br>  <br>  The formulas for stereographic projection come from similar triangles.  Let (x,y,z) be a point on the sphere, and let s be stereographic projection.  Then s(x,y,z) = x/(1-z) + iy/(1-z) is the mapping from the sphere to the complex plane.  Note that z=1 is the North pole and the mapping is undefined for that single point.<br>  <br>  Now the "meridian of longitude θ" consists of the points on the sphere (rcosθ, rsinθ, ±√(1-r^2) ), where r varies from 0 to 1.  Thus s maps these points to the complex numbers (r / (1±√(1-r^2)) (cosθ + isinθ).  These complex numbers all have argument θ, and the magnitude is (r / (1±√(1-r^2)) which varies from 0 to infinity depending on r.  Thus the image is the line through the origin on the complex plane, with argument θ.<br>  <br>  Anyway, that's the way I see it, and I agree with you that the problem could have been stated more clearly.
4xiOcnJtaa	Zero is definately an even number. Here are several good reasons and proofs:<br>  <br>  1. Zero can be halved to give a whole number. If you half zero you get zero which is a whole number.<br>  <br>  2. If you add two even numbers you always get an even number. Take -2 and 2 and add them together, you get -2 + 2 = 0. Therefore the rule says the result must be even.<br>  <br>  3. If a number has more than 1 digit it is the last digit which defines if it is even. We know that 10 is even, so the last digit must therefore be even.<br>  <br>  All numbers must be classed as even or odd; there is no neither. It either halves to give a whole number and it is even or it does not half to give a whole number and it is odd.|`|TqtzzsHjaa	it is even, as 0, is divisible by 2, and leaves no remainder.|`|0hxK0khKaa	Eveennn (:|`|897f9782bd9356ff775df4cf6a07496faa	Even: Zero was identified before the idea of 'negative integers' was accepted.

If one medium has a particular curved shape, it functions as a lens. The cornea, humours, and crystalline lens of the eye together form a lens that focuses images on the retina. Our eyes are adapted for viewing in air. Water, however, has approximately the same refractive index as the cornea (both about 1.33), effectively eliminating the cornea's focusing properties. When our eyes are in water, instead of their focusing images on the retina, they now focus them far behind the retina, resulting in an extremely blurred image from hypermetropia.|`|iMULlxdgaa	Here is a helpful article about the topic: <a href="http://www.divetheblue.net/pdf/DiveMed126.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.divetheblue.net/pdf/DiveMed12...</a>

b4ZDxiykaa	In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, geologists assumed that the Earth's major features were fixed, and that most geologic features such as mountain ranges could be explained by vertical crustal movement, through geosynclinal theory. It was observed as early as 1596 that the opposite coasts of the Atlantic Ocean—or, more precisely, the edges of the continental shelves—have similar shapes and seem to have once fitted together.[2] Since that time many theories were proposed to explain this apparent compatibility, but the assumption of a solid earth made the various proposals difficult to explain.[3]<br>  <br>  The discovery of radium and its associated heating properties in 1896 prompted a re-examination of the apparent age of the Earth,[4] since this had previously been estimated by its cooling rate and assumption the Earth's surface radiated like a black body.[5] Those calculations implied that, even if it started at red heat, the Earth would have dropped to its present temperature in a few tens of millions of years. Armed with the knowledge of a new heat source, scientists reasoned it was credible that the Earth was much older, and also that its core was still sufficiently hot to be liquid.<br>  <br>  Plate tectonic theory arose out of the hypothesis of continental drift proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912[6] and expanded in his 1915 book The Origin of Continents and Oceans. He suggested that the present continents once formed a single land mass that drifted apart, thus releasing the continents from the Earth's core and likening them to "icebergs" of low density granite floating on a sea of denser basalt.[7][8] But without detailed evidence and a force sufficient to drive the movement, the theory was not generally accepted: the Earth might have a solid crust and a liquid core, but there seemed to be no way that portions of the crust could move around. Later science supported theories proposed by English geologist Arthur Holmes in 1920 that plate junctions might lie beneath the sea and Holmes' 1928 suggestion of convection currents within the mantle as the driving force.[9][10][3]<br>  <br>  The first evidence that the lithospheric plates did move came with the discovery of variable magnetic field direction in rocks of differing ages, first revealed at a symposium in Tasmania in 1956. Initially theorized as an expansion of the global crust,[11] later collaborations developed the plate tectonic theory, which accounted for spreading as the consequence of new rock upwelling, but avoided the need for an expanding globe by recognizing subduction zones and conservative translation faults. It was at this point that Wegener's theory became generally accepted by the scientific community. Additional work on the association of seafloor spreading and magnetic field reversals by Harry Hess and Ron G. Mason[12][13][14][15] pinpointed the precise mechanism which accounted for new rock upwelling.<br>  <br>  Following the recognition of magnetic anomalies defined by symmetric, parallel stripes of similar magnetization on the seafloor on either side of a mid-ocean ridge, plate tectonics quickly became broadly accepted. Simultaneous advances in early seismic imaging techniques in and around Wadati-Benioff zones together with many other geologic observations soon made plate tectonics a theory with extraordinary explanatory and predictive power.<br>  <br>  Study of the deep ocean floor was critical to development of the theory; the field of deep sea marine geology accelerated in the 1960s. Correspondingly, plate tectonic theory was developed during the late 1960s and has since been accepted by almost all scientists throughout all geoscientific disciplines. The theory revolutionized the Earth sciences, explaining a diverse range of geological phenomena and their implications in other studies such as paleogeography and paleobiology.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Key principles<br>  The outer layers of the Earth are divided into lithosphere and asthenosphere. This is based on differences in mechanical properties and in the method for the transfer of heat. Mechanically, the lithosphere is cooler and more rigid, while the asthenosphere is hotter and flows more easily. In terms of heat transfer, the lithosphere loses heat by conduction whereas the asthenosphere also transfers heat by convection and has a nearly adiabatic temperature gradient. This division should not be confused with the chemical subdivision of these same layers into the mantle (comprising both the asthenosphere and the mantle portion of the lithosphere) and the crust: a given piece of mantle may be part of the lithosphere or the asthenosphere at different times, depending on its temperature and pressure.<br>  <br>  The key principle of plate tectonics is that the lithosphere exists as separate and distinct tectonic plates, which ride on the fluid-like (visco-elastic solid) asthenosphere. Plate motions range up to a typical 10-40 mm/a (Mid-Atlantic Ridge; about as fast as fingernails grow), to about 160 mm/a (Nazca Plate; about as|`|jiBEG95Uaa	i was wonderiing the same thing, r u someone frm ms. bartholomews class?|`|YpUhEviCaa	The geological history of Earth began 4.567 billion years ago[1] when the planets of the Solar System were formed out of the solar nebula, a disk-shaped mass of dust and gas left over from the formation of the Sun. Initially molten, the outer layer of the planet Earth cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10% of the Earth's mass,[2] known as Theia, impacting the Earth in a glancing blow.[3] Some of this object's mass merged with the Earth and a portion was ejected into space, but enough material survived to form an orbiting moon.<br>  <br>  Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, augmented by ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans.[4] As the surface continually reshaped itself, over hundreds of millions of years, continents formed and broke up. The continents migrated across the surface, occasionally combining to form a supercontinent. Roughly 750  Ma (million years ago) (ICS 2004), the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia, 600–540  Ma (ICS 2004), then finally Pangaea, which broke apart 180 Ma (ICS 2004).[5] The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 Ma (ICS 2004), then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 Ma (ICS 2004). The polar regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating every 40,000–100,000 years. The last glacial period of the current ice age ended about 10,000 years ago.[6]<br>  <br>  The geological history of the Earth can be broadly classified into two periods: the Precambrian supereon and the Phanerozoic eon.<br>  <br>  Because the Earth lacked an atmosphere immediately after the giant impact, cooling must have been fast. Within 150 million years a solid crust with a basaltis composition must have formed. The felsic continental crust of today did not yet exist. Within the Earth, further differentiation could only begin when the mantle had at least partly solidified again. Nevertheless, during the early Archaean (about 3.0 billion years ago) the mantle was still much hotter than today, probably around 1600°C. This means its fraction that was partially molten was still much larger than today.<br>  <br>  Steam escaped from the crust, and more gases were released by volcanoes, completing the second atmosphere. Additional water was imported by bolide collisions, probably from asteroids ejected from the outer asteroid belt under the influence of Jupiter's gravity.<br>  <br>  The large amount of water on Earth can never have been produced by volcanism and degassing alone. It is assumed the water was derived from impacting comets that contained ice.[21] Though most comets are today in orbits further away form the Sun than Neptune, computer simulations show they were originally far more common in the inner parts of the solar system. However, most of the water on Earth was probably derived from small impacting protoplanets, objects comparable with today's small icy moons of the outer planets.[22] Impacts of these objects can have enriched the terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, the Earth and Mars) with water, carbon dioxide, methane, ammonia, nitrogen and other volatiles. If all water in the Earth's oceans was derived from comets alone, a million impacting comets are required to explain the oceans. Computer simulations show this is not an unreasonable number.<br>  <br>  As the planet cooled, clouds formed. Rain gave rise to the oceans. Recent evidence suggests the oceans may have begun forming by 4.2 billion years ago.[23] At the start of the Archaean eon, the Earth was already covered with oceans. The new atmosphere probably contained ammonia, methane, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, as well as smaller amounts of other gases. Any free oxygen would have been bound by hydrogen or minerals on the surface.

That means the dimensions of the box are:<br>  <br>  Height = x<br>  Width = 6 - 2x<br>  Length = 14 - 2x<br>  <br>  The volume is the product of all three, which comes out to:<br>  <br>  Volume = 4x3  - 40x2  + 84x<br>  <br>  At both x = 0 and x = 3, this comes out to V = 0.

NbdTgyLPaa	These are almost all the same problem, just with different numbers.  The basic idea is that (Value of A)*(Amount of A) mixed with (Value of B)*(Amount of B) = (New value for combined A and B)*(Amount of A + Amount of B)<br>  <br>  For the first one, let x be the amount of coffee at $6/lb, then<br>  10 * 50 + 6 * x = 8.5 * (50 + x)<br>  500 + 6x = 425 + 8.5x<br>  75 = 2.5x<br>  x = 30 pounds<br>  <br>  For the second one, let x be the amount of water to be added, then<br>  0.2 * 25 + 0 * x = .1 * (25 + x)<br>  5 + 0 = 2.5 + .1x<br>  2.5 = .1x<br>  25 = x<br>  Note that this is a special case as the "value" of the water is zero.  As you do more of these problems, the simple cases like this should become more intuitive.  In a case like this you should realize that since you wanted something with half the "value," that you needed to double the amount, so the amount of water added would be the same as the amount of your initial boric acid solution, i.e. 25 ounces.<br>  <br>  For the third one, let x be the amount of the 10% solution, then<br>  0.6 * 40 + 0.1 * x = 0.2 * (40 + x)<br>  24 + .1x = 8 + .2x<br>  16 = .1x<br>  x = 160 liters<br>  <br>  For the fourth one, things are slightly different.  This time we are given the amount of the final combination, but not the amount of each part.  But we know that the two parts must add to the same amount as the result.  So let x be the amount of the 70% solution, then the amount of the 40% solution must be (20 - x), so<br>  0.4 * (20-x) + 0.7 * x = 0.52 * 20<br>  8 - .4x + .7x = 10.4<br>  .3x = 2.4<br>  x = 8<br>  So the amount of the 70% solution is 8 grams and the amount of the 40% solution is 20 - 8 = 12 grams.<br>  <br>  For the fifth, there is again something a little different, that is we're taking away something instead of adding it.  But we can still work it the same way, so let x be the amount of solution to be drained off and also the amount of water to be added, then<br>  0.6 * 40 - 0.6 * x + 0 * x = 0.45 * 40<br>  24 - 0.6x + 0 = 18<br>  6 = 0.6x<br>  x = 10 liters<br>  Note in this case we subtract x amount of the solution *and* we add x amount of water (which has a "value" of zero) to end up with a total of 40 liters of a solution.  Again like the second problem, you should eventually be able to see this is a simple ratio, and that we removed 1/4 of the original solution because the resultant solution has 1/4 less value than the original.

stAeoUeSaa	If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.<br>  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:<br>  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodingers_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence</a> <br>   <br>  The Bible also alludes to the ‘Big Rip’: <br>  Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip</a> <br>  <br>  If you don't have a good basic grasp of quantum mechanics, then you are more apt to think a Creator and the theory are mutually exclusive which is not the case at all.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	I trust your belief is the result of weighing the evidence, and is contingent upon that evidence and not a matter of faith.|`|0gNlwcaVaa	Evolution yes , that is one of man's greatest and proven theories, The Big Bang  NO. that is utter nonsense .

YYLybWHSaa	When there is a solute gradient across a membrane barrier the water is usually drawn towards the more concentrated side. Halophytes are plants that can survive this so have a mechanism to resist the internal water loss to environmental salinity or they adjust themselves to match the salt water they live in. This reduces to salt avoidance or salt tolerance. Plants in terrestrial situations with high salinity must use a biochemical pathway to exclude the salt and take up the water at their roots. Others take up the salt water and then separate the salt by biochemical pathways and sequester it inside.<br>  These pathways are expensive but allowed the plants to occupy a niche. Other plants lack these specialized adaptations.<br>  <a href="http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/lifeforms/halophytes/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanyt...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/lifeforms/halophytes/fulltextonly.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanyt...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tutorvista.com/content/biology/biology-iv/organisms-environment/ecological-adaptations-halophytes.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tutorvista.com/content/biolog...</a>|`|UmtOV8mRaa	It is because a salt solution is a hypertonic solution for freshwater plants.

Make x = 0, therefore y = 4. (0,4) is a co-ordinate that it crosses.<br>  <br>  Next, the x-intercepts.

stAeoUeSaa	Winter solstice- December 21, 2012 - is just the revealing of the 'antichrist' or the 'man of perdition' at the mid-point of what Christians call the 7 year Tribulation (just subtract 1260 days to get the start and add 1260 days to get the end). Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

The angle at the center of the polygon is<br>  180/n degrees<br>  where n is the number of sides. (You could also use the other angle, but since the formula is the same for either one, this is the simplest.)<br>  <br>  The radius r is the hypotenuse of each right triangle. That means that the perpendicular sides of the right triangle measure<br>  r sin (180/n) and<br>  r cos (180/n)<br>  <br>  The area of one of the right triangles is therefore<br>  r^2 sin (180/n) cos (180/n) / 2<br>  <br>  There are two right triangles to each of the isosceles triangles radiating from the center of the polygon, and there are n such triangles, so the area of the regular polygon is<br>  nr^2 sin(180/n) cos(180/n)<br>  <br>  For example, in the case of a nonagon, 180/n=20, so the area would be<br>  9r^2 sin 20 cos 20<br>  = about 2.89 r^2

FY4cCjsOaa	(a) For a complete model, the probabilities of all possible outcomes must add up to 1. So the probability of losing your $3 stake is<br>  1 - (0.009 + 0.1 + 0.6) = 1 - 0.709 = 0.291<br>  <br>  (b) The expected value is the some of the products of all payoffs and their probabilities.<br>  <br>  By the way, I assume here from the way the table is written that if you win your stake is returned. That is, if you win $50, you get your $3 back.<br>  <br>  The expected value is<br>  50 * 0.009 + 5 * 0.1 + 1 * 0.6 - 3 * 0.291<br>  = 0.45 + 0.5 + 0.6 - 0.873<br>  = 0.677<br>  and (c) after 100 plays you would expect to be $67.70 ahead.<br>  <br>  This does not necessarily mean playing is a good idea. For one thing, that $50 win comes around less than once every 100 plays, and if you don't hit it, your actual winnings won't be much.<br>  <br>  For another thing, any time someone is banking a game that appears to be loaded in your favor, you should always suspect something hidden is affecting the chances. Three Card Monte is a famous example of this rule.<br>  <br>  I once recalculated the chances in a craps game in which not only 7 and 11 but 9 were considered "passes" (immediate wins for the player), after hearing of an underground casino where that rule was followed. I concluded it might have been interesting (and dangerous) to bring a magnetic compass near that table during play.|`|nUYuqUQTaa	Samwise wrote:<br>  # "that $50 win comes around less than once every 100 plays" <br>   <br>  No. The probability of not getting a $50 win in 100 plays is: <br>  P{no $50 win} = (1 - 0.009)^100 = 0.991^100 = 0.405 <br>   <br>  so the probability of one or more $50 wins in 100 plays is: <br>  P{one or more $50 wins} = 1 - 0.405 = 0.595 <br>   <br>  therefore the most likely outcome from 100 plays is one or more $50 wins.

Therefore the endothermic sign convention is positive. A good example of endothermic reaction is photosynthesis! It needs sunlight to convert CO2 and H20 into glucose and O2.<br>  If its an exothermic reaction, this reaction gives off energy as the products formed give off energy because there was an energy gain in the process.<br>  I hope it helps if its not clear enough msg me!

8Y7LQ6TGaa	1) What is a solar flare? <br>  <br>  wikipedia:<br>  A solar flare is a violent explosion in a star's (like the Sun's) atmosphere releasing as much energy as 6 × 1025 Joules. Solar flares affect all layers of the solar atmosphere (photosphere, corona, and chromosphere), heating plasma to tens of million Kelvin and accelerating electrons, protons and heavier ions to near the speed of light. They produce radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum at all wavelengths, from radio waves to gamma rays. Most flares occur in active regions around sunspots, where intense magnetic fields penetrate the photosphere to link the corona to the solar interior. Flares are powered by the sudden (timescales of minutes to tens of minutes) release of magnetic energy stored in the corona.<br>  X-rays and UV radiation emitted by solar flares can affect Earth's ionosphere and disrupt long-range radio communications. Direct radio emission at decimetric wavelengths may disturb operation of radars and other devices operating at these frequencies.<br>  Solar flares were first observed on the Sun by Richard Christopher Carrington and independently by Richard Hodgson in 1859 as localized visible brightenings of small areas within a sunspot group. Stellar flares have also been observed on a variety of other stars.<br>  The frequency of occurrence of solar flares varies, from several per day when the Sun is particularly "active" to less than one each week when the Sun is "quiet". Large flares are less frequent than smaller ones. Solar activity varies with an 11-year cycle (the solar cycle). At the peak of the cycle there are typically more sunspots on the Sun, and hence more solar flares.<br>  <br>  2) What does the national grid do?<br>  <br>  distributes electric power throughout the country<br>  <br>  3) Name a reason why we can see stars at the night (Other than the fact that they're big)<br>  <br>  They are big and very bright.<br>  <br>  4) How do solar flares affect satellite signals?<br>  <br>  disrupt them<br>  <br>  5) What are comets made of?<br>  <br>  wikipedia<br>  Comet nuclei are known to range from about 100 meters to 40+ kilometers across and are composed of rock, dust, water ice, and frozen gases such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia. They are often popularly described as "dirty snowballs", though recent observations have revealed dry dusty or rocky surfaces, suggesting that the ices are hidden beneath the crust (see Debate over comet composition). Comets also contain a variety of organic compounds; in addition to the gases already mentioned, these may include methanol, hydrogen cyanide, formaldehyde, ethanol and ethane, and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain hydrocarbons and amino acids. Comet nuclei are irregularly shaped: they have insufficient mass (and hence gravity) to become spherical.<br>  <br>  Surprisingly, cometary nuclei are among the darkest objects known to exist in the solar system. The Giotto probe found that Comet Halley's nucleus reflects approximately 4% of the light that falls on it, and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly's surface reflects only 2.4% to 3% of the light that falls on it; by comparison, asphalt reflects 7% of the light that falls on it. It is thought that complex organic compounds are the dark surface material. Solar heating drives off volatile compounds leaving behind heavy long-chain organics that tend to be very dark, like tar or crude oil. The very darkness of cometary surfaces allows them to absorb the heat necessary to drive their outgassing.<br>  <br>  .
RRFiy9CAaa	In general, you can just use an array of unsigned integers. But since you are doing this in the context of encryption, which I assume you will want running as fast as possible, the choice of data type to use in the array will be important. For example, if your encryption scheme uses arithmetic operations modulo 2^32 e.g. Rivest's RC6 block cipher, a 32-bit unsigned integer data type would be appropriate. On the other hand, if your scheme mostly does 8-bit lookup tables, an array of unsigned 8-bit chars may be more appropriate. These days it is unlikely that you'll want to do 64-bit wide block encryption, but if that happens to be your thing. the long long (yes, two longs) data type may be suitable.|`|UcnhRNNwaa	Well, there is a 'long' integer type that has a greater capacity than 'int', just like 'double' has mroe than 'float'.

Trigonometry. The angle <OLM is a right angle, so you have a right triangle there.

Hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of glucose and amino acids within the active site contribute to binding. Prior to glucose binding, hexokinase is said to be in the open configuration. ATP is bound within the large lobe, but relatively far from the glucose binding site, and in a different position than it will assume in the operational active site. When glucose binds to the enzyme, a large conformational change occurs that closes the two lobes around the sugar substrate. This structural change occurs as a result of a new pattern of hydrogen bond contacts within the enzyme and between the enzyme and substrates. <br>  <br>   Go to<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com:8100/legacy/college/boyer/0471661791/structure/hexokinase/hexokinase.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www3.interscience.wiley.com:8100/...</a><br>  <br>  for structural tutorial for Hexokinase

But both C and F scales are linear, and have different rates of growth (1C is not equal to 1F).

JDK33laKaa	This is hard to explain without drawing a diagram. The outline is below. First, you need to solve for the triangle that is the lower half of the quadrilateral. Use the 1/2 (side a) x (side b) x sin(included angle) formula for area and you will be able to see that the area of that lower triangle is: 4*5/8 = (5/2). Note that you need to use the formula repeatedly for different triangles taking advantage of the fact that sin(pi - angle) = sin(angle).<br>  <br>  Assume the area of upper triangle of the quadrilateral to be "x" and then setup equations using the same area formula -- you will get area of upper triangle:<br>  <br>  [5 + (5/2)][4 + (5/2)]/[8 - (5/2)] = [15*13]/22<br>  <br>  thus area of quadrilateral = (5/2) + ([15*13]/22)<br>  <br>  I didn't double check the answer. but the approach should work.

KHSOVxViaa	Above iron the reactions are endothermic.  They need to absorb more energy than they produce.  It only happens because the gravitational force so compresses the stellar material that there is enough thermal energy to enable the reaction.<br>  <br>  Because this absorbs so much energy, the fusion doesn't last long.  The core implodes, and the shell explodes as a reaction.  It goes supernova.|`|lMN59lv2aa	This is because Iron-56 has the lowest mass per nucleon of all the isotopes. Each nuclear fusion up to that point loses net mass, releasing that mass as energy via Einstein's famous E=mc^2 equation. However, fusion between iron and anything else would cause a GAIN in mass, and that means a corresponding ABSORPTION of energy. This causes a drastic and sudden temperature drop in the star's core. The pressure generated by heat is the only thing preventing gravitation collapse of the stellar core, but since fusion of iron suddenly lowers that temperature, the pressure likewise drops — and the stellar core collapses very quickly in a dramatic implosion. This collapse sends a disruptive shockwave through the entire star, literally ripping it apart from the inside out, resulting in a supernova.<br>  <br>  So I'd say it's a little bit less efficient than using a rock as fuel.

DO1ebm95aa	A great homemade way of seeing movement (vibrations) like a seismograph is to use a laser and a mirror.  Put a very small or lightweight mirror on the thing that you want to track vibrations.  With the laser held in a clamp on a solid surface, shine the light at the mirror and project the reflection onto a distant wall.  The slightest movement will be highly exaggerated as a bouncing beam on the wall far away. You'll barely be able to move or breathe without causing the beam to bounce.  You'll just have to be careful to tell the difference between movements from footsteps on the ground versus vibrations on your object of interest.  <br>  <br>  You can also experiment with focusing the laser with a small lens so that the focal point lands on something shiny (not necessarily a mirror)--that focus point is so small that you'll get some diffraction patterns bounce off that will change with the slightest movement--it can be very pretty.  It may even detect heat currents in the air.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	what kind of surface, what do you want to measure? If an insect walks around on a piece of paper you can measure the vibrations, though you woulnd't have much luck on a piece of granit. <br>  <br>  What do you want to measure and why?|`|03ba4Vp2aa	Use a calibrated motion sensor that is connected to a computer that has the appropriate computer application for that device.

AA10132204	It depends on the sample and the machine.  If you are running solutions, you should definitely run a blank.  If you are running a plastic film, a standard is not needed because there is no "matrix" you need to subtract. The same is true for polymers and fibers.  If you are running a gas, it depends on the containers used.<br>  <br>  So if you want more info, describe the sample type and what state it is in.
Xj6BYev8aa	If you want to build an arch bridge, you should first build the deck of the bridge. Of course, the arch is going to be more difficult, but it's possible. One way to get the wood to curve you could try soaking it in water. This will make the wood more flexible. Then just make sure you support the bridge like crazy. Also, don't forget to include as many triangles as possible, they're the strongest shape. I did this project senior year in high school, its pretty fun. Good luck, and I hope this helped!|`|wo5cqmJyaa	<a href="http://www.garrettsbridges.com/photos/toothpick-arch-bridge" rel="nofollow">http://www.garrettsbridges.com/photos/to...</a><br>  Try this site it might give you some help. an Awsome arch bridge here. hope it works|`|MsnVIjbnaa	An arch bridge will be stunning but will take more time and materials.

UF2cLqs0aa	Start with 4 points in a three-dimensional space:<br>  P (0,5,4)<br>  Y (-2,7,4)<br>  R (0,7,4)<br>  A (0,7,6)<br>  <br>  Recall that these points are represented as (X,Y,Z).<br>  <br>  Our directions are to:<br>  1. Reflect over xz plane<br>  2. Translate 3 units back, 2 left, and 4 units up.<br>  <br>  To reflect over the XZ plane we just multiply the Y-coordinate by -1.<br>  Thus, our points become:<br>  <br>  P (0,-5,4)<br>  Y (-2,-7,4)<br>  R (0,-7,4)<br>  A (0,-7,6)<br>  <br>  I am going to assume that the y axis is "up", the x axis is to the right, and the z axis is "forward". But, this could be different depending on how one defines the coordinate system. The question is very ambiguous and should really define this for us.<br>  <br>  Thus, to move 3 units "back" means to subtract 3 from the z-coordinate. To move 2 left we subtract 2 from the x-coordinate. To move 4 units up we add 3 to the y-coordinate.<br>  <br>  So, from our translated points we get:<br>  P (0-2,-5+3,4-3)<br>  Y (-2-2,-7+3,4-3)<br>  R (0-2,-7+3,4-3)<br>  A (0-2,-7+3,6-3)<br>  <br>  Which simplifies to:<br>  P (-2,-2,1)<br>  Y (-4,-4,1)<br>  R (-2,-4,1)<br>  A (-2,-4,3)

z7BiMSWmaa	C. a complete set of their genes, but lose the ability to express most of those genes.
Ftkr9jqYaa	The answer is:<br>  <br>  B. Certain cells in the limb dedifferentiate, divide, and then redifferentiate to form a new limb.<br>  <br>  Reason:  In salamanders, the regeneration process begins immediately after amputation. Limb regeneration in the axolotl and newt have been extensively studied. After amputation, the epidermis migrates to cover the stump in less than 12 hours, forming a structure called the apical epidermal cap (AEC). Over the next several days there are changes in the underlying stump tissues that result in the formation of a blastema (a mass of dedifferentiated proliferating cells). As the blastema forms, pattern formation genes – such as HoxA and HoxD – are activated as they were when the limb was formed in the embryo.  The distal tip of the limb (the autopod, which is the hand or foot) is formed first in the blastema. The intermediate portions of the pattern are filled in during growth of the blastema by the process of intercalation.  Motor neurons, muscle, and blood vessels grow with the regenerated limb, and reestablish the connections that were present prior to amputation. The time that this entire process takes varies according to the age of the animal, ranging from about a month to around three months in the adult and then the limb becomes fully functional.

z7BiMSWmaa	B).serves as a master control gene that functions during embryonic development by controlling the developmental fate of groups of cells. <br>  AND <br>  D).produces a product that controls the transcription of other genes.
Ftkr9jqYaa	The answer is:<br>  <br>  E. cell-to-cell signaling and signal transduction pathways<br>  <br>  Reason:  CELL-TO-CELL SIGNALING is part of a complex system of communication that governs basic cellular activities and coordinates cell actions.  The ability of cells to perceive and correctly respond to their microenvironment is the basis of development.  Furthermore, there are three stages in the process of cell signaling or communication:<br>  <br>  1. Reception-a protein at the cell surface detects chemical signals. <br>  <br>  2. SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION-a change in protein stimulates other changes including signal-transduction pathways. <br>  <br>  3. Response-almost any cellular activity

5H7Wgaknaa	I suppose it's possible for the Moon's penumbral shadow to just miss the Earth but enter the upper atmosphere. The shadow would be roughly above the day-night terminator because the Sun would be on the horizon. I've never heard of anyone predicting these events.

UduT0agRaa	Bacterium<br>  <br>  <br>  In nature, many strains of bacteria exchange genetic information during a process known as conjugation, and the new genetic information is passed on to subsequent generations. The advantage of using bacteria relates to the single-celled nature of the organisms. Only one cell needs to be changed in order to integrate the new genetic information and allow for its transmission to the next  generation. This natural exchange of genetic information allows the organism an increased capacity to adapt to its environment.<br>  <br>  Example: In the pharmaceutical industry, bacteria and yeast are transformed with human genes of interest in order to produce therapeutics to treat human disorders.

We are talking about a time span of 50-70 million years here, and so prolific are possums that what is surprising is that they haven't spread further.|`|E2AUPvgOaa	wow  i have know idea...where did this come from?|`|nhwvYAJ6aa	Opossums don't get any respect. "This morning, I was talking to my vet about a worming medication for our opossums," says biologist Donna Holmes, who studies the species at Harvard University. "He said it sometimes affected an animal's central nervous system. Then the vet laughed and said, `But with opossums we don't have to worry about that.'" Holmes is a courteous, mild-mannered sort, but she took offense immediately. "You know, opossums have brains, too," she responded.<br>  <br>  As Holmes was reminded that day, the poor 'possum has never been held in very high regard. Purdue biologist Durward Allen once dismissed it as "a sluggish, smelly, disreputable critter without a semblance of character or self-respect." The biological literature itself is full of slights. Opossums are primitive "living fossils," we're told, barely differentiated from the earliest mammals. Opossums' social skills, we read, are rudimentary, more reptilian than typically mammalian. Says Steven Austad, associate professor of biology at Harvard and another expert on the species: "I think some biologists forget that opossums are mammals."<br>  <br>  That may be changing now. Recent studies by Austad, Holmes and others are now arousing new respect, if not affection, for this country's only marsupial. At the heart of this research are clear indications that opossums are more highly adapted, more sociable and more sophisticated in their survival strategies than any scientists had suspected.<br>  <br>  There are some 70 species of opossum in the New World, but only one is seen north of the Rio Grande-as often as not, lying flattened in the road at dawn. One of its earliest descriptions is also one of the most vivid: "An Opossum hath a head like a Swine & a taile like a Rat," wrote Jamestown's Captain John Smith in 1612, five years after his rescue by Pocahontas.<br>  <br>  More modern biologists emphasize that marsupial wonder, the fur-lined abdominal pouch. Inside that pouch, suckling opossum babies in the course of two months grow from roughly the size of honeybees to about the size of chipmunks. Once weaned, the young opossums are essentially on their own, pursuing a largely solitary existence of sleeping by day, foraging by night.<br>  <br>  But that doesn't mean they're rootless, uncommunicative, antisocial nomads, says Donna Holmes. "People used to say that opossums were so primitive, they did not even have a stable home range. They just stumbled around at night until they found a female and managed to copulate." To Holmes, that's just irresponsible opossum-bashing, due in large part to the fact that biologists in the field (who do stumble around at night) can neither see nor smell what the opossums they're tracking can see and smell.<br>  <br>  Working with a small colony of captive opossums at Bowling Green State University, Holmes has shown that the animals are capable of social interactions long thought to be too complex for a mere marsupial. They mark home ranges, establish pecking orders and sometimes even share nests. Holmes has evidence that odors are the hidden language of the opossum's social world-used not only for marking home ranges but also for keeping tabs on one's fellows, perhaps even gauging a prospective mate's virility.<br>  <br>  Opossums, fortunately, are highly odoriferous animals. "Opossums in the wild usually smell like dead fish or something," she says. "It can be pretty disgusting." Holmes speculates that each opossum may leave behind in its travels an olfactory signature, a unique "eau d'opossum" composed of substances both excreted and secreted. "It could be a very complicated bouquet of odors that let other animals identify that individual." Perhaps such findings don't vault the opossum into the gregarious company of whales and chimpanzees, but the discovery does indicate a capacity for purposeful interaction.<br>  <br>  Another oft-heard knock against opossums is that they ramble around aimlessly when foraging; to humans, the looping, meandering night travels can seem confused, even dim-witted. Yet the people who know opossums best attribute this seeming aimlessness to an overlooked but highly evolved adaptation: unsurpassed omnivorousness.<br>  <br>  "Opossums are essentially living vacuum cleaners-they eat anything," says Alfred Gardner, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist stationed at the National Museum of Natural History. To opossums, square meals can include fruit, nuts, insects, earthworms, small mammals, snakes, bird eggs, garbage, dog food and the occasional chicken. The opossum has evolved an immunity to snake venom so that rattlesnakes are part of the animal's preferred diet. In addition, opossums have been known to gobble up soil, bits of paper, even cellophane. "I'm convinced a lot of this had insect eggs, blood or something else on it," says Gardner. The opossum swallows the whole thing, and its digestive tract extracts whatever nutrients are available.<br>  <br>  An opossum is an omnivore with capital 0, in other words, which has survival value. Super-omnivor|`|u1T5TQP7aa	okay honestly I do not know the answer but this totally makes me laugh because last week I was by my granpdarents house with my sister and her boyfriend and I saw one!! it was so cool!
sr02Eoweaa	I go through depression as well. The long standing effect of depression is that you just dont want to do anything, even though you really want to and be happy and everything like that, really cant be bothered. <br>  <br>  I also questioned my sexuality once. When depression was really bad, I would walk down the street looking at all these women and have no desire to be with any of them thinking that none of them could spark my interest with having a relationship. So if I didnt like any women, could I be gay? In saying that, I never wanted a relationship with anyone else either, but I wanted someone to love and understand me which is what you feel but unfortunately that wont happen. Not when your suffering depression.<br>  <br>  The first place to go is www.beyondblue.org.au but thats an australian site so there should be one exactly the same in your country. <br>  <br>  My way of tackling depression is going on holidays by myself to places like asia, real tourist towns with tonnes to do and people who will talk to you because your foreign and will sound interesting. <br>  <br>  Most of the time, depression is nothing but mind games and can be sorted out by keeping your mind from going into overdrive and thinking too much. Its widely recommended joining a social club with people the same interests as you, lets just say for motorcycles and going out for rides and stuff. Depression will stop you from going, but you really have to try hard from chickening out, and you might not like it but you need to be social to the max to stop depression. <br>  <br>  Oh I almost forgot. I had a plan to do 10 things this year that I never did before. Writing a list and sticking to it, will get you out and motivated again. Whats the reason of life? To do all the cool **** you always wanted to do!!!! 1 was travelling to Thailand, done, the next was making my own porn film, done (hey Im a guy, every guys dream), next was promoting a concert and hanging out with the band, done. Once you do these things, you'll find a reason to live. Your just not having fun or expanding your mind at the moment, it doesnt have to be huge things at the start, why not just start with writing down like films that you'll get round to watching that you never watched before.<br>  <br>  All you need to do is stop thinking so much.

I too have occasionally had problems being satisfied with my life.  I recommend several things.  First of all, at least try to snap out of it.  No matter what people tell you, give you, or do for you, the main person that matters is you.  No matter how much help you get, if you WANT to stay depressed you will.<br>     Second, I would try opening up to your friends.  If they just don't listen or don't seem to care, find some new friends.<br>     Next, eat healthy.  This may seem unrelated but fast foods, candy, deep-fried foods, etc get me down because I get unhappy with my physical appearance.<br>     If none of the above work, try taking an herbal anti-depressant such as ginkgo-bilboa OR Saint John's Wort.  These may help with depression if it is only mild.  They can be found at any CVS, Rite-aid, etc and are relatively cheap.<br>     As a last result, talk to your doctor.  Nobody should be depressed their entire life and you may have a chemical imbalance in your brain.

The only place where such mutations can occur is in the production of the haploid cells (cells with a single set of chromosomes) in the sperm and egg, or in the joining of the two in conception. A reproduction accident anywhere else in the body will affect only the cell that suffers the accident. Such accidents will not be added into the gene pool and thus are not mutations. In such an accident, the sick cell is quickly replaced by a well one and the incident is over. Yet when such an accident occurs in the sperm or egg, it will appear in every cell in the offspring. This mutation then has a 50% chance of occurring in each grandchild. If the recipient of the mutation has several children, the odds are that the mutation will join the species gene pool by way of one or more of his children.<br>  <br>  Natural selection then determines the fate of the mutation in the species gene pool. The test is not survivability or excellence. The test is in species population growth. If the mutation aids the growth of the species population then it is successful and will remain in the gene pool.

NASA has the smallest budget of any government agency - I know it sounds like a lot, but it's peanuts compared to everything else, especially the war.<br>  <br>  The missions are expensive because they employ lots of people and have to buy a lot of materials - it can take 15 years to go from someone proposing a spacecraft to it actually being launched.  Contractors, builders, programmers, students, teachers, researchers, lawyers, architects, and many, many engineers spend years building and programming these spacecraft.  That's thousands of jobs, right here in the US.  We're not throwing the money down a black hole or something - it's all being spent right here in our economy.  NASA is actually one of the major government agencies driving the economy.|`|MMUGLjsPaa	You've gotten some good posts as to who's paying for the missions.. However, the first part of question is why are they so expensive?<br>  <br>  Besides the upfront planning that has to occur, here's what you need to consider:<br>  1) The Science: Experiments have to be designed and tested much of the equipment is a one-of-a-kind design.  So they're very expensive to produce. <br>  2) The science package has to "cleaned" such that there are no microbes living on it.  Microbes can corrode sensitive equipment even in space. Thus,  the entire package has to be assembled in a clean room by employees who are not only trained in how to put the equipment together but know how to follow clean room protocol.<br>  3) The package has to be tested to make sure it's functioning properly. <br>  4) Many times a second mock-up is created for parallel testing on earth.<br>  5) Parts have to have full traceability.<br>  6) the launch vehicle needs to be assembled and ten moved to the pad.<br>  7) The launch system has to fueled.<br>  8) Flight personnel have to be readied.<br>  9) a Mission team has to be assembled and on good working relations with each other.  They will come to work every day to monitor the spacecraft to make sure that it's operating correctly. Depending on how long the mission lasts they may be working for years on the project.<br>  10) Each employee is bringing home a weekly paycheck and health benefits to their families.  Not to mention Quality inspectors, accountants, budgetary review committee members, etc.  Everyone carries home a little piece of the pie.<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way all those rocket scientists aren't working for minimum wage either.

HsLx92qFaa	The Earth has always fluctuated between glacial and interglacial (warm) periods due to changes in the amount of solar radiation the planet receives. The Milankovitch cycles are one cause of this natural fluctuation. The three variables in the Milankovitch cycles are eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession (wobble of the axis). Eccentricity fluctuates between high and low every 100,000 years, axial tilt around >40,000 years, and wobble around >20,000 years. These variables add up to determine whether a certain time period will be glacial or interglacial.<br>  <br>  The Milankovitch cycles predict that Earth should be starting to cool off (head into an ice age) currently. However, the Earth is heating up, as evident from rising sea levels, melting ice caps, lower ocean pH. Why is this happening? Because human effects have overriden this natural cycle.<br>  <br>  A time series of global temperature anomalies also correlate with atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The recent spike in CO2 is due to human input. Coincidentally, just as humans increased CO2 dramatically, temperatures shot up.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Flower growth stages mirror other living things with a beginning, reproductive, and ending stage, except some flowers have an additional dormant stage. The terms for these stages are: Vegetative, Reproductive, Senescence, and Dormancy.<br>  <br>  Life begins as a seed.  A flower seed is similar to a fertilized egg. It contains a food store for the new flower's life, and a protective outer shell. In the first stage of plant growth, the Vegetative stage, the seedling absorbs moisture and nutrients from the inner food store inside the seed. When the flower has absorbed the seed foods and starts growing the root stem, and the shoot that becomes leaves, it penetrates the seed's protective wall and begins growth. The root grows down into the warm moist earth, while the shoot rises upwards towards the sunlight and warm air. Upon emergence, leaves unfold, and the roots continue to grow and spread. This continues until the flower seedling is fully developed with extensive roots, root hairs and leaves. The roots and leaves absorb moisture and nutrients from soil, water, and air.<br>  <br>  The next flower growth phase is the Reproductive stage. At this point, when the seedling has matured, it will produce a flower that has either male or female parts, or both. The flower contains pollen, which is then transferred to the egg part of the flower.  Transformations into new seeds, or pods containing seeds, begins to occur, as reproductive cells grow to maturity. Pollination can occur with the help of wind, vibrations, insects like bees, and animals. Alternatively, humans can artificially breed and cross-breed flowers through pollination efforts, or the splicing branches to other plants. The benefit of seed pollination is gene diversity, which may enhance the likelihood of species survival.<br>  <br>  A third growth stage, Senescence (i.e., old age), occurs after new seeds or pods have been produced and spread to make new plant life.  Flowers show deterioration similar to other organisms in old age, such as damage from free radicals and telomere shortening.<br>  <br>  Another growth phase that is different from Senescence is the Dormancy stage. In Dormancy, the flower goes into a state of hibernation, allowing it to survive intense winter weather and revive in the springtime with new growth, without going through a seed stage.  Dormancy can give a flower an edge, because it can build on the prior year's growth instead of starting over from a seed. This gives it a competitive edge in competition for sunlight and soil, because it is already big enough to dominate seedlings.

The atmosphere traps the small amount of energy from the sun that does reach the surface along with the heat the planet itself releases. This greenhouse effect has made the surface and lower atmosphere of Venus one of the hottest places in the solar system! If you were on the surface of the planet, the air above you would be about 90 times heavier than the Earth's atmosphere. This is like what a submarine experiences at 3000 ft below the surface of the Earth's ocean.

Atm74ULtaa	There are four reasons why Venus appears so bright to the naked eye.<br>  <br>  1) It has a high albedo, which means it reflects a large percentage of the light that it receives from the Sun. In fact, Venus has the highest albedo (65%) of any planet in the Solar System. Almost two-thirds of all the light that Venus receives from the Sun is reflected back out into space.<br>  <br>  2) Being the second planet from the Sun, it receives a lot of light from the Sun. Keep in mind that light intensity drops off rapidly with increasing distance.<br>  <br>  3) The entire planet is covered with white clouds, which reflect a lot of light. This sort of ties together with the high albedo that I've already mentioned.<br>  <br>  4) Being a neighboring planet, it is quite close to us and therefore the light doesn't have far to travel. Remember, light intensity drops off rapidly with increasing distance, so being close to Earth means that not too much of the light intensity is lost.<br>  <br>  I hope that you like this answer.

qXciQ9xBaa	Leaving out the complexities of "punctuated equilibrium," when you fill a gap you create two gaps on either side of it. Fill those gaps, you then have four gaps. Continue and you end up with smaller and smaller gaps eventually separating very very similar creatures.<br>  <br>  There are known to be gradual changes over time in a group of life forms. For example, aplodontids (primitive rodents that survive today as the sewellel or mountain beaver) show change from 3 molars in each jaw to 2 by gradual loss of the middle molar. On the other hand, prosauropods show abrupt transition to sauropod dinosaurs, although of course this could be from a single change in a regulatory gene producing a big change in the phenotype (body appearance).<br>  <br>  Don't let creationists sidetrack you by allowing changes "within kinds" but denying changes "between kinds." These are non-scientific terms that are so flexible as to be essentially meaningless.|`|GeIwAUvNaa	If a living thing dies, what are the odds of it becoming a fossil?|`|2TcvDn0yaa	The gaps argument is flawed for several reasons. First of all, the gaps argument is usually part of a false dichotomy argument. This is where they try to prove their position by disproving the other position (evolution). False dichotomy arguments are flawed because it leaves out other valid positions. That is why saying, "Evolution is wrong, therefore intelligent design is correct" is flawed.<br>  <br>  The gaps argument also suffers from an unsatisfiable flaw. It doesn't matter how many transitional fossils are found. It is impossible to find a fossil for every living thing that has ever been on this planet. So even though the fossil record shows clear transitions between species, the intelligent design proponents are never, ever, satisfied. That is a second reason why their gaps argument is flawed.
1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	It's actually pretty hard to fossilize something naturally - the vast majority of animals will simply decay or get eaten instead of leaving fossils behind for us to find.  We can't find every step along the way, because that would involve fossilizing every single generation of a species.  But it's ridiculous to claim that these 'gaps' imply that evolution isn't true, especially when we can trace it through genetic evidence.  It's like saying you're going to watch me walk to school in the morning.  You turn around for 10 minutes and I've walked 1/4 of a mile.  You can either assume I kept walking while your back was turned (very reasonable, since you know I can walk) or assume that some god must have picked me up and moved me while you weren't watching (very unreasonable, since that's never been shown to happen and gods haven't been shown to exist).|`|HTmj2BXDaa	I don't think any particular arguement that is supported by intelligent design proponents is any more or less flawed than any other.  Intelligent design (as a theory of evolution of species on earth) is fundamentally flawed from the outset.  If you believe that the bible is literally true and believe that the earth is only 6000 years old, you obviously will not be swayed from your faith by rational arguement or scientific evidence. <br>  <br>  To answer your question...  by this argument, a jig saw puzzle of a pink elephant can not be a picture of a pink elephant because there is a piece missing.

ejodXS5naa	I would say radio emitters can be tuned over the largest range.  Lasers are generally only tunable by less than a factor of 2.  Microwaves can easily be tuned over an order of magnitude.  But their are devices that can tune from kHz to many MHz in the radio wave range.  So if you are specifically looking for tunability, I would say radio waves are your best bet.  Why do you ask?

The first, the sum of two numbers equals 28, x+y=28.  The next equation will be x-y=4.  Next we will solve for x in the first equation.  We get x=28-y.  We will then plug what x equals into the second equation.  So, 28-y-y=4.  Now solve for y.  28-2y=4.  Y should equal 12.  Then your going to plug in the value that you got for y into the first equation to solve for y.  The first equation is x+y=28.  So... x+12=28.  Solve for x and you get x=16.

In this type of bond, Chlorine will share its own electrons between itself and the other atom with which it has bonded. <br>  <br>  When forming an ionic bond, the same principle applies: Chlorine will bond with an atom from which it can borrow just 1 electron, in order to satisfy the octet rule. However in this type of bond, Chlorine will NOT "share" its electrons with the other atom. Instead, Chlorine (which in its unbonded state exists with a charge of -1) will participate in a charge interaction with an atom of a charge +1 (ex- Na+, K+, etc), thus forming an ionic salt.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	it 'grabs' an electron from something else to complete it's outer shell.

nhwvYAJ6aa	Parthenogenesis is a form of asexual reproduction in which females produce eggs that develop without fertilization. Parthenogenesis is seen to occur naturally in aphids, daphnia, rotifers, and some other invertebrates, as well as in many plants. Komodo dragons and the hammerhead- and blacktip sharks have recently been added to the list of vertebrates—along with several genera of fish, amphibians, and reptiles—that exhibit differing forms of asexual reproduction, including true parthenogenesis, gynogenesis, and hybridogenesis (an incomplete form of parthenogenesis).<br>  <br>  The offspring of parthenogenesis will be all female if two like chromosomes determine the female sex (such as the XY sex-determination system), but they will be male if two like chromosomes determine the male sex (such as the ZW sex-determination system), because the process involves the inheritance and subsequent duplication of only a single sex chromosome. The offspring may be capable of sexual reproduction, if this mode exists in the species.[clarification needed] A parthenogenetic offspring is sometimes called a parthenogen. As with all types of asexual reproduction, there are both costs (low genetic diversity and susceptibility to adverse mutations that might occur) and benefits (reproduction without the need for a male) associated with parthenogenesis. There are species, such as some Kalanchoe plants, that once had the capacity to reproduce sexually, but no males have ever been discovered.<br>  <br>  Parthenogenesis is distinct from artificial animal cloning, a process where the new organism is necessarily genetically identical to the cell donor. In cloning, the nucleus of a diploid cell from a donor organism is inserted into an enucleated egg cell and the cell is then stimulated to undergo continued mitosis, resulting in an organism that is genetically identical to the donor. Parthenogenesis is different, in that it originates from the genetic material contained within an egg cell. Egg cells may be produced via meiosis or mitosis oogenesis.[4] If by mitosis, the egg that undergoes parthenogenesis can be either haploid or diploid, leading to a number of possible outcomes in terms of the genetic fingerprint of the parthenogen. Whether the parthenogen is haploid or diploid, because meiosis was involved in forming the gamete that subsequently underwent parthenogenesis, incidence of crossing over would effectively create a new genetic fingerprint; this would be of particular importance in the case of a haploid parthenogen, in which crossing over would drastically alter its single chromosome genotype.[clarification needed] Because there are so many variables in parthenogenesis, there is little that can be said for sure unless the specific methods of the particular parthenogenetic tendencies of an organism are known.<br>  <br>  What is for sure, though, is that a litter of offspring resulting from parthenogenesis may contain genetically unique siblings. In organisms possessing an XY chromosome system in which parthenogenic offspring are female, parthenogenic offspring of a parthenogen would be genetically identical to that parthogen because all offsprings of parthenogenesis would be homozygous.<br>  <br>  Parthenogenesis may be achieved through an artificial process as described below under the discussion of mammals.<br>  <br>  The alternation between parthenogenesis and sexual reproduction is called heterogamy. Forms of reproduction related to parthenogenesis, but that only require the presence of sperm that do not fertilize an egg, are known as gynogenesis and hybridogenesis.|`|HtsyRRXzaa	when the woman was growing up, and producing eggs, there was a problem in meiosis, one of the cells split yet the chromosomes did not, giving an egg that has all the chromosomes, just like a normal cell in the body - (it can also be done by mitosis)<br>  when that egg was released and if it attached to the womb, it would grow and be basically a clone of the woman giving birth (it would have to be a woman)<br>  <br>  this is rare in humans but common in some animals

oKRbe6XYaa	The Northern Bobwhite, Virginia Quail or (in its home range) Bobwhite Quail (Colinus virginianus) is a ground-dwelling bird native to North America and northern Central America and the Caribbean. It is a member of the group of species known as New World quails (Odontophoridae). They were initially placed with the Old World quails in the pheasant family (Phasianidae), but are not particularly closely related. The name "bobwhite" derives from its characteristic whistling call.<br>  <br>  Description<br>  Northern Bobwhites are distinguished by a dark cap stripe behind the eye along the head, black in males and brown in females. The area in between is white on males and yellow-brown on females. The body is brown, speckled in places with black or white on both sexes, and average weight is five to six ounces (145-200 grams).<br>  <br>  The Northern Bobwhite's song is a rising, clear whistle, bob-White! or bob-bob-White! The call is most often given by males in spring and summertime. Other vocalizations include a range of squeaky whistles.<br>  <br>  Ecology<br>  This fowl primarily inhabits areas of early successional growth dominated by various species of pine, hardwood, woody, and herbaceous growth. However, quail habitat varies greatly throughout its range which extends from Mexico east to Florida and north into the Upper Midwest and Northeast. In the southern U.S., pearl millet has been identified as a preferred food source for Bobwhite Quail.<br>  <br>  It forms what are known as "coveys", groups of five to 30 birds, during the non-breeding season (roughly October-April). During the breeding season, typically beginning in mid-April, the Bobwhite coveys dissolve. Social pairs are typically formed between individuals of unknown relationship. These social pairings potentially result in the formation of a mate bond and subsequent female fertilization and egg formation. Eggs are laid at a rate of approximately 1 per day, and they hatch after 23 days. Eggs are normally white in color with a more pointed end than normal chicken eggs.<br>  <br>  Both males and females can incubate nests, with most nests predominantly incubated by females. If the first clutch of eggs is unsuccessful, a breeding pair (may be the same pair or a different pair as that which led to the previous nesting attempt) will attempt to lay, incubate, and hatch additional clutches. If the clutch is successful, chicks are precocial and will leave the nest approximately 24 hours following hatching. The breeding season continues until mid-October, and successful nesters (females) can potentially lay, incubate, and hatch up to 3 clutches.<br>  <br>  The Bobwhite Quail is a popular and economically important gamebird, particularly in the US Southern States. It is the official game bird of the U.S. States of Tennessee, Georgia, and Washington. Habitat degradation threatens wild populations, so it is propagated in captivity in large numbers for release on hunting preserves or natural areas as required by US wildlife agencies. It is moderately resilient to hunting pressure, and locally can disappear entirely from overhunting, as has occurred time and again[1]. It is also found in many aviaries and is on display in some zoos.<br>  <br>  If a bobwhite quail is stationary, it is nearly impossible to see (in a forest). This coat of camo is important because quail are heavily preyed upon. Foxes, coyotes, racoons, possums, hawks, owls, and humans eat quail.

This is because the instrument can resonate in different modes which are not necessarily related in frequency.<br>  For instance the classic church bell has two main resonances, one caused by the bell widening and narrowing, and the other caused by it distorting into an ellipse. Bell makers tune a bell by shaving off metal until the two tones are close to harmony.<br>  In contrast, in other instruments there is usually only one sound source per note, such as an air column or a vibrating string, so only integer harmonics are produced.

8htt2mjRaa	Yes, you can start at a community college. I recommend it because it is a great way to save money. GE is always a good start and is mandatory anyways. Find out a nursing school in your area that you would like to attend and find out the requirements for admission into their nursing program. Any 4-year college offering nursing will suffice, just as long as you obtain a bachelor's degree in nursing.<br>  <br>  When you start college, you will be considered pre-nursing major. This phase is usually 2 years depending on how quickly you finish the required classes. Required classes are usually anatomy, physiology, intro to general chemistry, intro to organic chem, microbiology, and some other courses that fulfill GE such as communication, english, etc. Find out the requirements for admission to the school so you know what you need to do to get admitted.<br>  <br>  Once admitted into a nursing program, you will be considered a nursing major. Programs last 2-3 years depending on the school. Get good grades, especially in nursing classes. While in a nursing program, expect to take organic chemistry and/or biochemistry because these are usually required for admission into CRNA school. And do well in these courses.<br>  <br>  After graduation, you must work in an ICU environment for at least one year in order to be eligible to apply. Of course, the more experience, the more likely you are to get admitted. It would be a good idea to work in a well-known hospital that is known for their intensive/acute care. CRNA school is quite competitive so anything you can do at the start of college and thereafter to make yourself a strong candidate is something I highly recommended.<br>  <br>  What you need to do now is find a 4-year college that you plan on attending that has a nursing program and find out the requirements. Nursing programs are usually highly competitive to get into since there are limited number of spots and many applicants. And get excited and motivated! I did not consider becoming a CRNA until recently when I found out there was such a thing. Work hard, keep that GPA as high as possible when in college, and good luck!|`|AA11432707	First of all, most female anesthesiologists that I know have families.  I have a husband and three kids.

People used to believe the Earth was flat and if you sailed far enough, you would fall off the edge. On maps, this unknown edge was labeled simply, "Here there be dragons." In the universe, we have the same thing, an unknown edge of sorts. We know certain things about the stars. One thing we know is about the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect is the classic train whistle, which when the train is rapidly approaching is apparently pitched higher than when the train has past and is moving away. Light, as with sound, bunches up as a star approaches (higher pitch), and spreads out as it recedes (lower pitch), just as the sound from the whistle does. The approaching star tends to shift towards blue, and the receding star shifts toward red. More stars are showing a red shift than a blue shift which that from our point of view, more stars are receding from us than approaching toward us, which tends to point to an expanding universe.

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	There is nothing that says it WILL burst. Weather balloons, for example, do NOT burst, but reach equilibrium where they displace as much air as they weigh and no longer rise in the atmosphere. Look at the Hindenburg for example, floating at a constant altitude, displacing exactly the same amount of air as it weighs. And then it crashed and burned, but never mind that...  Before it crashed, it was in equilibrium and simply floated. If the balloon does not have enough room for the internal gas to expand or isn't a strong enough material, then it will burst. There is no determining how high it will go before it either can retain the internal gas pressure and float at some altitude, or it isn't strong enough and it pops. Weather balloons, by the way, usually have a timer to release gas after some amount of time so they come down in a relatively rapid predictable manner instead of simply slowly losing altitude and becoming a hazard to aircraft. No balloon can completely contain helium. Some helium molecules are slowly leaking out. You've seen how a helium balloon you got for your birthday slowly loses helium and when new will bounce hard against the ceiling and over days, the rising force becomes less and less and then one day, it slowly drops from the ceiling on the weight of the ribbon alone and eventually settles to the ground. THAT is from helium leakage, which no material can completely stop, only slow down.

TBsVmUoCaa	In chemistry, polarity refers to the dipole-dipole intermolecular forces between the slightly positively-charged end of one molecule to the negative end of another or the same molecule. Molecular polarity is dependent on the difference in electronegativity between atoms in a compound and the asymmetry of the compound's structure.<br>  <br>  Electronegativities of the elements(Chart):<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronega...</a><br>  <br>  The answer is 4.CH3F since F is the most electronegative of all F>Cl>Br>I<br>  <br>  Note: CH4 is non-polar because forces are equal on all sides of C exerted by H.|`|Cx5YSqIZaa	It's easy... CH3F is the most polar because Fluorine is the most electronegative in the alogens serie.<br>  <br>  answer 4
TBsVmUoCaa	1. SO2- the molecular structure of SO2 is basically identical with that of water. Both are polar due to the angle between the bonds.<br>  <br>  2. CH3Br- see the other question you posted, which I also answered :)<br>  <br>  3. H2O- see 1.<br>  <br>  4. BF3- structure of BF3 is boron(group iii) central atom surrounded by 3 fluorine atoms. boron has no lone pair of electrons so the 3 bond pairs space themselves out equally to for a trigonal planar shape. the shape of BF3 is thus a perfect equilateral triangle. there is no imbalance due to this shape, thus no polarising effect.<br>  <br>  5.NF3- nitrogen being a group V element has 5 valence electrons. 3 are used to bond to fluorines so the last 2 electrons form a lone pair. 3 bond bairs and 1 lone pair space themselves out according to VSEPR theory to form a tetrahedron. the F atoms themselves appear as a trigonal pyramid (the lone pair is not seen). since the 3 F atoms are pushed to one side of the central atom N, the molecule is polar.<br>  <br>  The answer is 4.BF3|`|MV1DPvHGaa	BF3 is non-polar <br>  its symmetry cancels the individual bond moments..|`|KJHw0oI3aa	BF3 has a trigonal planar geometry.  Even thought the bonds between boron and fluorine are polar covalent, the charges are distributed symmetrically making the molecule nonpolar.  All of the other molecules have polar covalent bond, but there is always a greater concentration of positive and negative charges at opposite ends of each molecule making all of them polar.<br>  <br>  Answer:  BF3 is a nonpolar molecule

Otherwise, talk to your doctor about getting a different medication.  I have no clue if the cold extraction process works, but playing "chemistry set" with your medications is a bad idea.

EN32vSsCaa	A Pro-drug is any medication which must first be metabolized into its active form before it can exert any pharmacologic activity.  It is usually given orally but can be (rarely) given via injection.  An example would be Vasotec (enalapril).  It needs to be converted to enalaprilat before it can function as an ACE inhibitor.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  A Pro-drug given intravenously will undergo activation by the liver just like one given orally.  As far as concentration is concerned, the IV administered one will be higher.  This has to do with bio-availability.  A drug administered via the IV route is 100% bioavailable, therefore higher concentration.  An orally administered drug must first undergo absorption and is usually not 100% bioavailable, so a lower concentration.  Hope this makes sense, it's a complicated subject.

In between, the parabola is inverted.  Since you are integrating from 2 to 6 you can just integrate the quadratic and drop the abs value.  If you were integrating where it is inverted, you would have to drop the abs value and change the sign of each term in the parabola (ie negate the parabola).<br>  <br>  The 2nd FTC tells you how to take the derivative of an integral.  Basically, you ignore the 2 because it is constant and you just plug the x^2 into the square root(x^3-2x+6) and drop off the integral sign.  Multiply this by the derivative of x^2.

lKXLaJ0Taa	First the substance must be volatile to some extent.  That means that the substance must be able to diffuse and has some liquid/air partition coefficient.  Once the substance becomes volatile, it enters the nose and dissolves in the mucus membrane of the olfactory epithelium where it attaches to a specific receptor.  It is beleived that only a small part of the molecules is recognized by the receptor and thus a large molecule can stimulate multiple receptors each at a different epitope on the molecule.  Attachement of the chemical to the receptors stimulates the neuron which sends the signal to the olfactory cortex via the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I). Depolarization of the neuron is through cAMP, calcium influx and chloride ion channels.  The olfactory cortex then decodes the signal based on which receptor was activated and the frequency of firing of the nerve.  The olfactory nerve synapses in the olfactory bulb where mitral cells are stimulated and send the signal to the entorhinal cortex, the amygdala (where a specific emotion is tagged to the smell), the olfactory tubercle and the piriform cortex.   Humans have much less receptors and a much smaller olfactory cortex than most other animals.  It is believe that we have only about a thousand different receptors that differentiate smells. And our olfactory epithelium is small compared to other mammals.

You do this automatically. If acidity decreases, your respiratory rate will decrease. You will be trying to "hold on" to acid in your blood, so you won't breathe so frequently. Remember that increased acidity means lower pH, alkalinity means that pH rises.<br>  If your acidosis problem isn't corrected by faster breathing in 24 hrs, your kidneys kick in, and will dump baking soda into your blood stream to try to buffer the acid. This is metabolic compensation for acidosis.<br>  If you need details, talk to a respiratory therapist, or look up "arterial blood gases" on the internet.

524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	1) The Mayan calendar does not end.  That was an invention by José A. who wanted to sell books (back in the 1980s), pretending that he had found something important about the Meso-American calendar (of which the Mayan calendar is now the best-known example).<br>  <br>  On the date we call 2012.12.21 (not 12/12/12), the Mayan calendar will reach day number 13.00.00.00.00 and the next day will be 13.00.00.00.01 (and it will continue).<br>  <br>  In fact, the Mayans themselves used their calendar to date an event they thought would take place (on Earth, involving humans), after the year we call 4000.<br>  <br>  Obviously, they expected neither the world nor their calendar to end.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  2) Nibiru does not exist.  At least, not as a separate planet.  The name was used by Babylonians to identify the planet we call Jupiter.<br>  <br>  When working on very old document, Zecharia S. invented the idea of a planet on a strange eccentric orbit that came to the inner solar system every 3600 years or so.  In his story, the next return was scheduled for 2085.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  3) Nemesis does not exist.  In a theory published in 1984, David Raup and Jack Sepkoski thought that a brown dwarf orbiting the Sun could be responsible (indirectly) for the major extinctions on Earth.  The data on Nemesis was based on an apparent cycle in the extinctions.<br>  <br>  By the middle of the 1990s, better paleontological observations (and better infrared astronomical observations) showed that the cycle was not as regular as the theory required and that the brown dwarf did not exist.  The theory was dropped (and Nemesis along with it).  In any event, based on the data in the hypothesis, the next return of Nemesis was to be in 13 million years.<br>  <br>  Do not confuse the non-existent brown dwarf Nemesis (the one used in the Big 2012 Hoax) with the Minor Planet Nemesis, the asteroid that will miss us in 2029 and in 2036.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  4) Planet X does not exist.  It was invented by charlatans, based on the "messages" from aliens received by Nancy L.  They used Planet X to explain their prediction of the end-of-the-world for... 2003.  They had a book for sale on how to survive the passage of Planet X.<br>  <br>  2003 passed and many of us managed to survive without giving them money.  So they revised the book, used José's date and enhanced their Planet X by adding stuff from Nibiru and Nemesis.<br>  <br>  They then created fake documentaries for television and YouTube.<br>  <br>  They also created most of the "Ancient Prophesies" (Nostradamus, the Bible, the Egyptians...) after 2003 -- otherwise they would have clashed with their 2003 prediction.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  5) There is a movie that will come out soon, called "2012".  It is a story about Earth facing the end-of-the-world because of (you guessed it) a planet X coming out way.  In the movie, there will be a lottery to determine who gets to survive.<br>  <br>  I expect the science in that movie to be awful (as it was in Armageddon).<br>  <br>  As we know, movies need a lot of hype before they are released, so we are bound to hear a lot more about 2012 and Planet X.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  The Sun does NOT line up with the Galactic centre.  It can't.  The Sun's southernmost declination (at Winter solstice every year) is 23.44 deg. South.<br>  <br>  The declination of the Galactic centre is 29.0 South.<br>  <br>  The Sun misses by over 5.5 degrees.<br>  <br>  And it gets that close every year, around Dec. 21 (for a few centuries).|`|AA10744471	Historical futurist scenarios<br>  <br>  Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), who was involved in alchemy and many other things in addition to science and mathematics, studied old texts and surmised that the end of the world would happen no earlier than 2060, although he was reluctant to put an exact date on it.<br>  <br>  Many believe that the Maya civilization's Long Count calendar ends abruptly on December 21, 2012. This misconception is due to the Maya practice of using only five places in Long Count Calendar inscriptions. On some monuments the Maya calculated dates far into the past and future but there is no end of the world date. There will be a Piktun ending (a cycle of 13 144,000 day Bak'tuns) on December 21st, 2012. A Piktun marks the end of a 1,872,000 day or approximately 5125 year period and is a significant event in the Maya calendar.

There are many people with Mayan ancestry alive today, so the Mayans have not died technically. The Catholic Church did its best to wipe out their culture, but some of it still remains today.<br>  <br>  All that is going to happen on Dec. 21, 2012 is that the sun will align with the center of Milky Way galaxy on the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. The dying of plants, the dying of the year, and, in the Mayan long count calendar, the end of the 13th cycle of 13,000 year cycles has a lot of symbolism attached. The Mayan calendar does not end. All that will happen is that the fourth Mayan "world" will die and the fifth Mayan world will be born with the beginning of new cycle of cycles. The Greco-Roman civilization equivalent is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius, which happened 41 years ago (??). 13,000 years from 2012, the sun will align with the center of the Milky Way galaxy on the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, as long as the Earth's orbital parameters remain approximately the same. The only other thing that is predicted to happen in 2012 is that solar activity for solar activity cycle 24 will be at a maximum.<br>  <br>  The Mayan - Aztec sun-stone calendar is round. A round calendar cannot end.<br>  <br>  Ok. I'll try to explain a little more. Remember, this is important because it happens at a WINTER SOLSTICE in the northern hemipshere. The Sun will align within 1 degree of the center of the Milky Way Galaxy on a winter solstice as predicted by the Mayans. There is a radio star call Sagitarius A*, usually abbreviated Sag A*, at -6 degrees declination on the celestial sphere. Sag A* is not AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. There is a 30 million solar mass black hole, a dimensional singulairty AT the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Anything else AT the center goes down the black hole, which is NOT made of the densenst material known. If you want to look toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy, go outside in mid August abhout half an hour after sunset. Look to the south. The Constellation Sagitarius has a famous asterism known as "The Teapot". Wait until it almost completely dark and you might be able to see the Milky Way running from Sagitarius through the Summer Trinage of the bright stars <br>  Altair in Aquila, Vega in Lyra, (which is straight overhead at sunset in mid-August), and Deneb in Cygnus, which is also known as the Northern Cross.<br>  <br>  PLEASE, stop screaming, Apollo.

The "world" or, more precisely, the planet Earth will end in approximately 5 billion years from now, when the sun starts turning into a red giant. The increased heat and radiation will burn our atmosphere away and evaporate all oceans, rendering the planet uninhabitable.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, by that time we will have explored space enough to establish permanent colonies elsewhere in space. Or, perhaps, the humanity will die out long before that due to nuclear wars, pollution, epidemies, etc. In that case, our "world" will end but the planet Earth will happily carry on without us.<br>  <br>  Whichever way it happens, it won't be in your lifetime.

The Earth will then be engulfed by the sun, and burning up.  <br>  <br>  Our galaxy will collide with the Andromeda galaxy in about 10 billion years, ending all worlds near the collision, even though we will already be gone.<br>  <br>  Finally, according to a new scientific theory, the universe will be taken over by dark matter in about 40 billion years, and the universe will start all over again.  According to that theory, our world will never end.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helped you, and if it did, rate this the best answer.  Thank you for reading.|`|GPQnyI0Daa	As far as we as individuals are concerned it will be when we die.<br>  It may well continue to exist thereafter but we will have lost the opportunity to be of any significant purpose in the life of the world.<br>  Predictions of the end of the world have been around for thousands of years so we become sceptical and de-sensitised to world events. Current scientific predictions  give us plenty of time to get our house in order so if you are a materialist that means when you die you will de-materialise and become lawn feed for man and beast.<br>  <br>  On the other hand if you believe you have a unique heart and soul that survives such an inglorious fate then cheer up ,the existence of the world in its present form is not something that you should feel sorry about . That's because the very best social and economic forecasts of the day predict gloom and doom on a catastrophic scale , such that the survivors will be nothing like as well off as they are in our privileged society but instead share the same third world conditions. That means rather worse terrestrial and atmospheric conditions that will be difficult to sustain a healthy existence, despite or because of all the technological revolutions we are caught up in.<br>  <br>  Personally, I am an optimist as I believe the human Soul to be intended for eternity only far more fulfilling and pure. But also it is self destructible and we have the choice here and now to prepare for a new world order that transcends physical boundaries .<br>  <br>  The Earth was designed with a protective hi tech shield against all kinds of attack. Asteroids, deadly and incessant radiation , a very delicate gravitational and magnetic control system as between our tiny sun and an even tinier satellite moon to keep the land to water masses within very important perameters.<br>  Indications are that Earths amazing core is kept in check but, once unleashed ,as once was the Powerof the Sea, then  Earth would be wrecked by all kinds of havoc.( Tsunami being a warning perhaps)<br>  <br>  The timetable for Earths existence is programmed already and will not be a result of accidents but of coincidences between our present world order and administration at a higher level.<br>  <br>  To spell this out presents a problem as todays society has a mental block over anything to do with prophecy .Thats because so many expected the world wars of politics to be the catalyst.<br>  <br>  In fact the final war, even now possible at the throw of a switch in the middle east will certainty be the beginning of a New Conquest whereby the present world order disappears forever.|`|2tdokuWvaa	Here, go to this.

I have witnessed a Vet clean the tongue of a dog with an OraBrush tongue cleaner and completely cure the dog's bad breath.  Look on your tongue for some white stuff, especially on the back of the tongue.  That is the bacteria and must be removed in order to get rid of bad breath.

BhumxInEaa	1. The use of the phrase "refused to rule out" when the official actually said "cannot rule out". <br>  <br>  "refuse" has the connotation of willfulness by the person in the face of choice; "cannot" has the connotation that it is not in the person's control. The implication is that the author knows the terrorists were domestic and that the government official was being unreasonable in not admitting it.<br>  <br>  2. The use of "nuclear-armed Pakistan, teetering on political and economic crisis" as opposed to just "Pakistan" tries to make this incident more important than it is by linking it to people's fear of a rogue nuclear power.<br>  <br>  Pay attention to adjectives. I'm sure you know the old joke about men vs. women: "men are firm, women are stubborn"<br>  <br>  3. Similarly, though there seems to be no evidence of which militants were involved, the paragraph, "For decades, Pakistan's ISI military intelligence agency has fostered Islamist extremists in Kashmir and Afghanistan to counter-balance arch rival India and there are suspicions that some ISI elements have links to militants." tries to link the ISI with the perpetrators of this attack.

7ZBRP6R5aa	Water is a substance that has the ability to dissolve most acids and bases. Its able to do so because of  its polarity. Although it cannot dissolve some compounds like oil, it is still known as the most soluable solvent. Therefore the statement is true. The structure of the water molecule plays an important role in this property. How well a liquid can surround and stabilize an ion to "shield" its charge determines how well ionic compounds will dissolve(exceptions are organic compounds,oil).

You can't see those objects even with the most powerful earth based telescope because atmospheric disturbance prevents imaging at such high powers.<br>  <br>  However, the Japanese SELENE probe in orbit around the moon was recently able to image the blast area from the lunar module of one of the Apollo missions - 15 if I remember correctly.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Because they're 250,000 miles away !|`|e0227973f38e13ea78ebdb8fcda760efaa	Because you can't. The moon is too far away and the objects are two small. Plus we don't have the resolving power.<br>  <br>  Question... Why can't you see the atoms in you hand?|`|AA10929465	They're too small.  You can see the moon even though it's so far away because it's very large.  Even the Hubble telescope is less than 1000 power.  I did the math and decided you'd need about a million power telescope to see the trash we littered on the moon.  A million power telescope would have to be hundreds of feet in diameter.  The largest optical telescope under construction I know of is only 1/10th that.  Put simply, nobody has come up with the money to build a telescope anywhere near big enough.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	The moon is about 400,000 km away.   <br>  Even the Hubble telescope, as good as it is, can only see objects around 10 meters in diameter at the distance of the moon (and the rovers and flags are a lot smaller than that).|`|yaq7oaH6aa	You eyes are far too small to see something that small at that distance.|`|5EIrFbHkaa	The moon is far away, and if the hubble is directed to the moon it probably see this objects, but the moon is too brilliant for the normal telescopes because it reflects the light of the sun, and is necessary various corrections to adjust the lens. The telescopes from the earth has this problem of oscillation of the light which is the influence of the atmospheric heat in the air(like you watch over a long road heated by the sun - the image tremble)<br>  But, why you want see this, if the astronauts was there to put them in those places?<br>  In the Nasa museums they has several rocks collected from the moon.<br>  <br>  collecting rocks:<br>  <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/samples/apollo/tools/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/samples/ap...</a><br>  collections of rocks:<br>  <a href="http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/in...</a><br>  spaceships on moon:<br>  <a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread287147/pg1" rel="nofollow">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thre...</a><br>  <br>  Ho!|`|AA10265178	Because you don't have telescopes for eyes :]|`|x2mgUMb6aa	your eyes are not strong enough.|`|99b10f4e17c90f53aac6dadc4e974c00aa	they r too faaaaaaaar away to be noticed|`|UpZFb6X5aa	It's too far away.|`|ceQqYxtnaa	...because you're looking for them where they are not there

vxSXsn59aa	I would recommend waiting a while before embarking on such a venture. A new technology is developing which could potentially make a Mars mission much easier, much more productive in terms of discoveries, and much safer for the astronauts. It could provide a limitless supply of oxygen, drinking water (or other beverages, even), food, and power, all created directly from the Martian environment, and make space suits much more comfortable, lightweight, and even including a kind of built-in, odor-free toilet which could be used without de-suiting. <br>  I'm referring to nanotechnology, a buzzword that's been all over the place for some time now, and there's good reason. The potential applications for this are limitless, quite literally. It's coming, it's coming sooner than people expect, and it will change everything. It really has every bit of the potential I have written of, and I feel that it's of critical importance that people educate themselves about it, ahead of its development, and give very careful thought to it, because its potential for MISuse is even greater. We will have to be very cautious in how we allow it to be applied. The military uses are the biggest worry, to me. <br>  <br>  The online book below is sort of a nano-primer, and goes into more detail than I can, as well as explaining better. It's well worth a read.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.foresight.org/UTF/Unbound_LBW/" rel="nofollow">http://www.foresight.org/UTF/Unbound_LBW...</a>|`|iN91UZvdaa	Most probably everything.

It's impossible, and a waist of time. We don't even know the simplest basics of life on Earth. How could we live on Mars? <br>  You can calculate the effects of gravity, and electromagnetism, and such.... But we will never know the cause for these forces.... And we live alone, on a lonely world. Earth is Home.|`|scNQnnbraa	We have the technology, but we need the money and time. Here are the steps to terraform (or make a planet able to support life) Mars.<br>  <br>  1. Send spacecraft to set up a base.<br>  2. Send spacecraft to set up mirrors to concentrate sun on the planet and heat it up. This will cause trapped gasses to be freed and thicken the atmosphere.<br>  3. Send spacecraft with plants and stuff to keep them alive. The huge amount of CO2 will cause the plants to thrive. The plants will release Oxygen.<br>  4. After many years we will have to send a spacecraft to monitor conditions and check if Mars is life supporting.<br>  5. If Mars can support life then we will send a manned spacecraft to voyage to Mars and land at the base.<br>  6. If Mars cannot yet support life then we will send more plants and put up more mirrors in orbit.|`|thlWLeGMaa	Theoretically we could use slightly modified Apollo spacecraft to get to mars, and build some sort of habitable environment pod.
