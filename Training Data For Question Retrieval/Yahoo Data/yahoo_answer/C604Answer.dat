757f10afa027007eb6d9e797f2776feaaa	I dont think you should be wearing a suit, unless you are a guest. If you are strictly the photographer, you should dress for the job.   Our photographer wore black pants, black shoes, and a black shirt tucked in. And we had a nice wedding.  I assume you will be carrying heavy equipment and moving your upper body a lot, so a dress shirt or suit will prevent you from moving freely. Remember, if you are the photographer you will not be in the any of the pictures, either. However, no khakis or tshirts please!|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Get a suit that is comfortable.  One that fits well, so you don't feel it is pulling when you stretch or bend.|`|pFS2LZGKaa	I dont think there's any convention, since Ive been to many weddings and photographers usually wear something simple but formal, such as a button down shirt and black pants and black shoes.|`|DqetlSB6aa	slacks and a shirt and tie or a tux- maybe coordinate with the wedding colors|`|69qn7muFaa	Well, I think you should dress appropriate for a wedding. I mean, two reasons. It's your family's wedding, so I'm guessing you're gonna be in the family pictures right? and because you're gonna be all over the place that people will see you and won't take you seriously as a photographer.|`|tBODwcqXaa	A lot of wedding photographers wear black slacks, flat shoes, and a button-up shirt. It kind of lets people know you are a worker and it allows you to, like you said, go around everyone comfortably. Hope this helped!|`|ZfleGhXLaa	A wedding photographer dresses at the same respectable formality of any other invited guest.  (This applies to other invited vendors that do not have a specific uniform to wear, as well)      Wear exactly what you would have worn if you were attending as just her brother.  I cannot suggest exactly what to wear, because the formality of events varies greatly, large evening receptions usually being the most formal, and daytime receptions usually being a bit more relaxed.    Yes, dress comfortably enough to work, but also dress to blend in among the other guests.  My sisters 7-month pregnant photographer did the job in a tea-length cocktail dress, and pantyhose after all.|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	you want to disappear as much as possible.  Wear a black dress shirt, black pants, and shoes that don't make noise.|`|gt5Zdy1uaa	I agree with the others...    Dress for a wedding as if you are a guest, which you are but you just have an extra job to do. I would suggest slacks ( tan or black )  and a button shirt and a tie. I hope this helps and good luck with the photographys but dont forget to include yourself in the pictures as well.|`|QNuW7ivyaa	Dress as a guest.  You want to blend in.  You arent going to be the only one there with a camera, you dont want to stick out in someone elses photos by being under or over dressed.|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	could you not get a pair of comfortable black pants? maybe not super expensive dressy ones, but at least a slack that comfortable for one, and can be dressed up for two. if the wedding isn't in the summer, find a nice sweater to pull it all together, or a button up shirt or something, I think you can for sure dress on the casual side, but you need to look Professional, that's the key here.
VXBulo3Yaa	I would tell him that since you have had no contact with him...by his choice, that you think it is something that you would rather not attend.  If you did go, would he treat you like garbage?  One of my friends did that to her dad.  Did not include him in wedding pics and put him at a table with just random people.  His wife was mortified.  They left before dinner was served at the reception due to being so humiliated.  Her dad had always been there for her, but after she got out of high school, her parents divorced and the mom is bitter and nasty.  We all saw it coming, just one of those things where they were waiting on the kids to grow.  I felt so bad for him...he did nothing wrong but her bitter mom in her ear all the time made it that way.  I hope that same scenario would not happen to you.|`|g6zhJQRyaa	my advice is that you totally accept yourself as the mom for all your children, and ignore bad feelings from the past ...  concentrate only on the present and on the fact that you love your children unconditionally ...   ignore your divorced husband as much as possible, yet be polite to him ... treat him with the same respect you would give to any person you do not know ... that you no longer know.    do not talk about the past ... focus on finding out what your children are interested in today ... develop the ability to have a good conversation with them, and if they mention anger from the past, have the good nature to tell them you are sorry for any hurt they suffered and that you hope they will forgive you if you were the source of their pain, and then you take the lead in the family, and you move on.      As you move on, and as you forgive all of them, and show them that they are not to blame for anything that happened, and that you do not have any hurt feelings from they past, they will follow your lead and move on too.    If your son invites you to his wedding, you should tell him you feel honored to attend.  Go to his wedding and wish him all happiness.   Be a mom.  Let them grow up, get married and be happy.    ---|`|gt5Zdy1uaa	Im sorry to hear about your problem. Did your son invite you to the wedding? If anything my best advice, would be to call him and talk to him about everything and hopefully try to put together the remainents of your and his relationship and also talk about the wedding.     good luck|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	what's wrong with this picture? You are the Mom, the grown up one in this situation since the kids were little.  It was your responsibility to keep in touch and to invent ways to stay close to your children.  If you are invited to the wedding you should go and don't make any scenes.  If you are not invited, don't go, but do send a nice gift and a best wishes letter.  It's not too late to have some sort of relationship.  Years of no contact except Christmas?  That's your fault, too.  You may be missing a sensitivity chip since you say 'why can't everyone move on'.  This is your child!|`|rJJhMQ37aa	If my son invited me to his wedding, I'd go.  Better to do that than to continue hard feelings.  If he didn't invite me, I'd feel sad.      But, I'd try to hold out an olive branch, not hold a grudge.|`|0AShsMsoaa	the phone works both ways.  quite the queen on the throne insisting that your children bow to you with you making no effort yourself.      you feel you dont want to attend?  how dare you.  really.      the result of the parent child relationship rests on the parent. not the child.  you are bitter, you are spiteful, and you wear your ugliness on your sleeve.  it is a sin to be as vengeful as you are to your own children.  they have done nothing to you but try to live their lives.     be grateful you have a healthy son who has found happiness, go to his wedding with a big smile, fake it if you have to, wish them both well, and everyone else you encounter, and, by doing this you will find that it will help make the huge chip on your shoulder easier to bear.  and open a door to more contact.      it is the right, the only thing to do.  it is easy to be cruel. it is harder to be kind and loving.  but it is the right thing to do.     shame.  shame.  shame.|`|z4c7zGKmaa	If you really want everyone to just move on, use this as a stepping stone.  Attend your son's wedding - You will regret it later on if you don't.  Go, be civil and at the end of the day, you will be glad that you were the bigger person.|`|pub2GLZPaa	Did your son invite you?    If he did, then go.    If he didn't, then don't.
JGGbQhCaaa	It may be a question of how to break up. Y'all got to come to some real clear understanding about the violence. It's totally unacceptable, unless you think being a punching bag is part of the deal.     Boy friend sounds insecure and immature. Or are you behaving inappropriately? Y'all better do some talking before you walk down that aisle. And make it clear by your words and actions with that other/those other guy(s) that  you are absolutely not interested.  Peace.|`|OAvQvEIUaa	Do you really want to make up???He doesn't seem to trust you at all .
Ectn7tkSaa	Firstly, it isn't fair and she probably didn't mean what she said...she only said it because she was angry and upset.  But if this goes on all the time I suggest you end the relationship because no one should stay in a relationship where the other person makes them feel bad about themselves, upset or unhappy.  Relationships are meant to make you feel happy.  Also, she may have some psychological problem which she should see a psychologist about.  Just an idea as you said it seems to happen often.  If it happens over nothing then I think she should look into that further.  Something needs to be done as I don't think you want to be in a relationship like this for the rest of your life.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You are a glutton for punishment; why would you even stay with her???? Do you enjoy being yelled at? She is clearly deranged and needs psychiatric help and you need to stop enabling her to bully you. Her crying is contrived and phony, and you need to get her out of your life NOW.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	You don't want to lose her?  Why not?  She is abusive, and she makes you miserable.    Ask yourself if you could live your whole life long with a mate who is constantly abusing you?    There are nicer girls out there.  Please go and find one.  You will be much, much happier.  I promise.|`|F3UjXpmTaa	Girls think it is alright to have that double standard.  Well, it isn't right and neither is what she's doing.    You should end it, that's not very loving towards you and I'm sure you deserve better.  She's going to cry over the break-up as well, but only to make you feel bad and get you to stay.  The trick is to not give in to her guilt trips.|`|Z0KQenm9aa	um... dump the girl... she needs to get her act together and no one is gonna whale on me bro... scream at me and call me names consistently and hit me... no no no i aint no punching bag for anyone... i am a female... life is tough enough... you dont need anyone male or female if they treat you like dirt... she has issues and she needs to solve them before before before she is good for anyone ... you are worth Jesus... He gave His life for you so you dont deserve to be treated like that... and dont feel sorry for her... because she will screw up your life like you dont know... let her solve her own mess ... work on improving your life... you gotta live with you!!|`|ARLr7k0Faa	I really think you need to breakup with her! You need to lay down the law i dont really think she is good for you if all she ever does is make you feel bad!|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Unhealthy relationship.  You need to bail.|`|blWqFlxgaa	grow some balls and break up with the *****|`|HVG32PWuaa	get a new girl  yeah I know you love her but dump her and act like you dont want her. she will come back and tell her that you will take her back but she better respect you and one out burst will result in another break up. you 2 will break up and you wont get married cause no1 marries a person who they fight with a lot. so break up and get a new girl..i swear you will wish you listened to me when your older.|`|rIOD8tgvaa	Get out of this relationship.  Can you imagine how you both will interact if you ever get married...WWII.  Your relationship is not healthy.  You are going to need help to stay in this relationship...serious counseling.  I don't think you really want to stay in this relationship.  It is more of an addiction than happiness.  I think you have already made your decision by writing your own comments.|`|Dud46s2Daa	She's probably not used to anyone stepping up and defending themselves, hence one of many boyfriends.  They probably just got rid of her so they didn't have to deal with the screaming and hollering all the time.  Sad thing is, she probably doesn't even know that she is doing what she's doing because she's done it for so long.  Sit and talk and see if maybe she has a disorder that can be medicated.  Your feelings are just as important as hers and relationships have to be 50/50 or they won't work.|`|TKHA5okpaa	GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It sounds like now it's her turn to feel like ****  And I dont think you should feel guilty for yelling at her if you are only defending yourself, if you start becoming the one who goes into attack for no reason thats not good either, but if she starts to cross her line then you need to lay the smack down.  I've done exactly what she is doing too, believe me us girls will walk ALL OVER a guy if we can get away with it. And I dont believe the physical harm stuff she is claiming either, if you've never physically hurt her then she has no reason to throw that in your face if you've never touched her.  Also I know I am totally being a traitor to women but let me tell you what I learned from my present relationship.  Sometimes us girls need to be put in our place. Especially if she's gotten comfortable pushing you around. And it's abuse just like if a guy was doing it to a girl, little by little they find out "hey, I can get away with this and he's just gonna take it"  So, I used to talk **** to my boyfriend all the time and trust me I have a really big mouth and one day I guess I went too far, I did it in public and he had enough, he calmly told me it was enough and he was going to teach me a lesson...so he didnt talk to me for a few days, then everytime I almost started to go back to my old ways, he would scream right back at me and as much as I hate to admit it, he has basically put me in my place. And if she is doing it in your own house, or in front of your family or friends she needs to learn to have some respect. If someone sees a girl yelling and belittling a guy they dont think the girl is a b**** , no, the first thing they think is that guy is a p***y, and has no respect for himself, it's an embarrassment.  So the next time she does it to you, you have to keep putting her in her place, trust me she's gonna learn eventually.  And your not a shitty boyfriend, it sounds like she's a shitty girlfriend, DO NOT CRY when you tell her things are going to change, she cannot scream and talk down to you anymore and she needs to have some respect for you as a man, if not then she's not a woman just some stupid loud mouth b****.  Think about it, do you really want people looking at you saying "look at this idiot he lets this girl talk to him like he's a donkey????"    And this advice is coming from a girl okay!
AX3DQw3Paa	Don't let her go, emotionally or physically. She's obviously having problems and she needs you. She needs you to be there as physical comfort and as emotional. Ask her what's going on. Be there. Ask her. Hope everything goes well.|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	Ask her what you can do for her! Be a friend let her stay the night comfort her!!! I have an idea it is a boyfriend that broke up with her! Just be there for her!|`|vk1TcfTeaa	just be there for her. tell her you won't let her go. ask what you can do for her, but best of all... listen. sometimes just spilling your heart to another person is enough to help you feel better. And just honestly respond to what she tells you. Just accepting her and welcoming her thoughts and tears will help her get through whatever it is she's struggling with right now.|`|9GUuVYinaa	maybe she had a nightmare and she was glad it wasn't true and that you were fine!....???

GSzQWlccaa	Love is love man, you cannot explain why a man and a woman fall in love, there is no need to explain or highlight a trend here, it happened because whoever involved gave it a chance to happen, and so it did.|`|C46DNX11aa	ha, ha, thats funny. Yummy mommies. ha, ha,|`|wWBkIkTNaa	I thought most Asian men were married to Asian girls. Out of all the ethnic groups in the world, Asians are the ones most likely to stick to their own kind.

hvFN0JLVaa	Im 18.  Ive had terrible experiences with both my parents.  My parents were divorced when I was 9.  When I turned 17 my mom turned psychotic and abusive towards me.  When CPS becme involved it was the BEST thing for me.  the things in my life now are not well, but a whole lot better than before.  I recommend getting CPS involved.  what you need to do is file a report with CPS.  then they get involved and they will advise you about legal action.  email me for questions.  I understand what it is to have terrible harmful parents. jeffreymward@gmail.com|`|HbSKFnDxaa	Bring her to court!

29I8PWrxaa	My fiance and I are experiencing the same thing lol.  I posted the same question a couple weeks ago on the Men's Health board and a whole bunch of guys told me that he should try masturbating earlier in the day if he thinks he might be getting lucky that night.  That makes a guy last longer the second time around.  My fiance has tried it and says it helps.  Other than that, I can tell you that my fiance asked his doctor about it when he was there for a check-up and the doctor told him that it's pretty much normal, but wanted to check to make sure he didn't have any STDs because that can make a man more sensitive and orgasm quicker.  (By the way, the doctor checked and he didn't have any.)  The other thing the doctor said was that health, fitness, and diet can have an impact on how long a man lasts in bed.    The other thing the guys on the Men's Health board said is that he could just be excited about getting engaged and stuff ... and he could just be "really into you", more in love with you than other partners he has been with.  And actually, the doctor backed that up ... seems cliche, but that's what they told us!     I guess he might want to get checked out  by a doctor if it's a real problem to rule anything out, and as long as nothing is wrong health-wise, then just try to be understanding.  As long as he tries his best, and finishes you off afterwards (or beforehand), then it's not a big deal.  Movies and the media makes people believe that a man is meant to be able to last for hours ... but that's not realistic at all.|`|k6F9zkIRaa	I've noticed that if I have sex wit my fiance earlier in the day, then have it again later in the day or at night he tends to last longer. Or what you could also do is when he thinks he is close he could stop and then give you more attention, like oral. Then he can go at it again! Good Luck!|`|BBlfetz3aa	try switching positions or telling him to slow down when he is getting close. that works for me|`|JdNhezdIaa	you need to spice it up maybe things getting abit stayil try sumthing diffrent, or you not giving it up enough how often do you have sex maybe more is whats needed|`|6mZJSqBgaa	First, please refrain from referring to having sex with your fiance as 'give it up'.  That's so demeaning and juvinile!  You're getting something too, aren't you??    Anyway, have you communicated this to him already?  If you let him know how you feel, he'll probably make an effort to last longer for you.    Either things are becoming too routine, or maybe he doesn't see you getting pleasure from it and ends it quickly for your benefit.  Whatever the reason, it's important that you tell him you want more.
y4SUDnpaaa	This a legal question and if your attorney can't give you a straight and specif answer, I would change lawyers. Is this a lawyer one who specializes in divorce cases, that's the kind you need.|`|5k7BexD3aa	If she doesn't have an attorney then yes, your attorney should let her know.|`|CP1VYev4aa	too confusing. who is her, and who is him???????????
ybpJUWRnaa	The best thing you can do is even if you and your ex husband's relationship with each other is dead you still have to be united parents. It is extremely bad form for parents to try to play off of each other in regards to the kids. It is still important that the two of you, if possible, can agree on uniformed rules for both of your houses. That then negates the "if you don't do what I say I'll go to Dad's/Mom's."     Don't negotiate with your kids though. You have to be the parent and if you set rules, your son has to follow them. That's just good parenting. It will be infinitely easier if at least on this one issue you and your ex are on the same page. In the long run, if you two can still both be parents together it will work out for the best for both of your kids.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Let him go live with his dad until he calms down, the more you oppose him the more he will want to go.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	oh for heavens sake...grow up and be a parent.

He doesn't NEED t.v. he needs a parent, a grown up who will take care of him and love him...not THINGS.|`|bNhyEJHsaa	Sit him down for a nice,long talk.  Ask him what he is mad about. Maybe he misses his father?|`|f1i6DPHFaa	I did this to my dad when I was a kid. I think the best thing would be to tell him that when he turns 10 he can decide to live with you or his dad. Make sure he knows that he can either decide to live there or to live with you, but he can't move back and forth when he doesn't like what one parent says. It's important for you to make him realize that you are trying the best you can.   Maybe you should have a family night or something where you two play games, etc. I know this was always special to me and I looked forward to it every week.  How long ago since his brother moved out? He could just be trying to express the hurt of being left, so he's acting the way his brother did and thinks it is acceptable.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	when you are 8 and are being a brat you will say anything especially when you are not getting your way|`|6C24kJhaaa	he's influenced by your 15 yr old.

The kid probably just misses his dad a lot. Anyone would get mad at a parent for sending them to bed early if they're 8 years old. He was likely just trying to get you to let him stay up later. It's temporary.    Give your child a serious talk about the hard times during the economic crisis. Tell him how others do the same thing, tell him it's not going to be that way forever, but you just need him to be strong.    And if you have internet, let him watch tv online every now and then.    And if you don't do something similar already, have a family dinner every so often. Maybe once a week, just you, your kid, and your husband.|`|JO3HiGfHaa	Alright, I'm not a dad but I was an 8 year old kid only around 10 or 11 years ago so I might have a shot at this.    First off, his brother is obviously a huge impact on his life. He probably misses him, he's gotta be mad you killed the TV, and he's just full of emotion; you realise you seperated him from his brother... their's clearly got to be some feelings of regret that he didn't follow his brother. I'm not saying you have to be a bad parent but I know if when I was 8 my older brother said he was living with dad I would say I was living with dad too.|`|HbSKFnDxaa	He's just copying his brother.

Ask him why does he want to go to his dads', Ask him is something going wrong ar the house. He is really missing his brother he is also acting like his brother, he feels as though if he can do it why can't I. He doesn't mean to be disrespectful or rude, but from what I hear he has been hurt a good deal(I'm talking about losing his brother and his dad). He doesn't hate you, he's just hurting inside and he needs away to show it. Most kids take there anger on there parents(mainly mothers) especially when there loved ones aren't together. He's really following his brother if you just sit down and talk to him and try to understand where he is coming from. He truly loves you he was speaking in anger. He may need to just let some steam off. Hope I could help. later!

You sound like a really wonderful person who would make a great friend . Slow down , don't push yourself or people . Be yourself at all time neither  trying to impress people nor trying to make them be your friend . Talk to other people and give them a chance to know you , you will find that there are many more girls around that want someone like you to strike out in a conversation with you . I was a teacher of English in high schools for 26 years and one thing I learned was that in order to get to be friendly with my students , I had to get to know them and give them the opportunity to get to know me . I would stand at the door every day and as each student came in , I would smile and hold may hand out to shake their hand and tell them I sure was glad they were in my class . By the end of the year , I had students coming from other classes to shake my hand because they had not had their hand shake for the day . They loved it and so did I .

NhOQ3mRxaa	Hi!  Ok, Take him to his favorite place this could be a resteraunt a family's house and have dinner or some place he really likes to go to! Have a nice dinner and sit close to him give him kisses tell him that you love him so much and possibly say you never want to lose him and then take a hold of his hand look him in the eye and make sure he is looking at you and say "baby will you marry me?" that sounds so romantic to me!!!|`|wBxXGASgaa	set him up on a date romantic dinner with a great view of the night... hey wait its suppose to be the other way around wtf|`|AAaux2Ryaa	I'd say don't take that moment away from him... let him propose.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Personally l think your making a mountain out of a mole hill When this unfortunate incident happened you were together.It's only voyeurism.All guys like porn and especially soft porn.You've a right to be cross but to stop his sexual activity is'nt the answer.After all he Was'nt secreted away in some dark dungeon slavering over some hot chick.No he was right there in front of you browsing.Let him know your displeasure without any demands.Don't spoil a good healthy relationship on such a trivial incident.Be happy you love each other and your child.Don't rock the boat.It's not worth it|`|wE2etBzbaa	I checked your original question and I thought the answers are so angry..   I think you should be angry if it was in front of your kid.. otherwise, I don't think it is a big deal.  since he didn't look like someone who was hiding that from you, otherwise he would be watching for the door.        just my thought, but each couple has their rules, but that online girl was definitely insane, maybe I should play uno too, jk|`|lhgYaMn2aa	I don't agree with alexander w - yes guys watch porn, they get off on visual stimulation.  However, unlike porn this was a real live person performing at the other end of a webcam for another person....    I think you've got the right attitude here, if he wants to get his fun jacking off to girls on a webcam then let him know you'll be getting yours the same way, regardless of whether you actually intend to do it.  I'm sure he'll soon see things your way after he's thought about that!  if he doesn't seem bothered then maybe you need to re-consider a relationship where he thinks this is acceptable behaviour.  it's one step away from cheating, would his next move be to go and see the 'live' show??!  Just because her boyfriend doesn't seem bothered has nothing to do with it either - that's their business!

Accept it as natural because it is and its not going to change.|`|CjkT6ZjNaa	because we are taught that they are feminine, since we are little kids we are taught not to stare at them, that women are supposed to cover them, etc. and so they become this part of the woman that men love, crave, obsess over. think about it, are most men attracted to hands, arms, knees, feet...no. It is the parts of the body that are covered, and we men...are visual people.|`|jUK4qp60aa	Okay here is one of many reasons but perhaps the most common: Guys like sexual portions on a girls body that they themselves do not possess. Yes, guys have breasts but  cannot have A cup, B cup, and so on sizes unless they have surgery or a weight problem.    Guys like boobs for the same reason guys like vagina's (because it is a sexual part of a girl  guys do not have )     Also, it is taboo  for a girl to walk around with her breast exposed.Guys like what they can't have or see without a girls permission.    There are many more reasons...but all guys will agree with those two reasons.|`|n3ScHJU6aa	thier really atractive like eye color or something else thier just a majesti thing

Childhood is the one time you can truly enjoy life. Enjoy highschool. Enjoy 12th grade. They have college for a reason. If you are planning on going to a college, then study and enjoy life until you graduate. College is meant for you to see what you want to do. You choose classes according to what you like to do and they have majors for that. If you don't like it, then you can change it. Don't worry. Just keep like, 4 professions that you like and select a college accordingly. College is a time to find your place in this world. So chillax. I'm a junior in highschool and all I have done is plan to go to college. Many of my friends are doing the same. Dont panic or have anxiety.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	College is usually a good next step. I would find one close to home if you're worried about going far away. I did the opposite and regretted it because I missed family so I moved to a college 3 hours from home instead of 20 hours. Now I'm all the way across the country from them and it's not as hard on me.    Really, don't worry though, college is a good time because there is still time you can go home to see family, and you get to spend all summer at home, so it won't be that bad.     Some people are just homebodies and want to live close to where they grew up. I personally don't want to live anywhere near where I grew up mainly because of the weather. I have a friend that wants to move back to where her parents are when she's done with college and try to find a job close to there.     If college isn't for you, maybe either a job or a trade (hair cutting, plumming, air conditioning, etc)  would be good. You could stay at home until you are ready to find an apartment or home close to your family.|`|7U0sPJ2saa	Three years is a long time, brosef. Chill.|`|HVG32PWuaa	you need to graduate to get a diploma to go to college to get a real job to leave home.

Have your parents told you that you have to move out the minute you finish high school? Have you decided if you're interested in attending university or learning a trade? You could look up what your country seems to be short on worker wise and see if anything appeals to you. That might help you feel like you're at least planning things and you have goals.    A lot of people don't know what they want to study when they are your age. Talk to your parents, find out their expectations. If they insist you're out the door at 18 then I'd recommend having some kind of job in mind and perhaps a friend with whom you could share a place with. Or maybe a relative with an extra room.     Whatever the case, it's best not to stress over it. It won't do you any good and the events you are worried about haven't even happened yet. If this really bothers you, there's no harm in talking to a counselor - they could help you get some coping skills and put things into perspective. Good luck.|`|wCZ3T5QLaa	Don't sweat it. Your still a freshman in highschool and you have two more years before you need to even begin to committing yourself to your future. Most of my friends who have graduated felt the same way but everything slides together around your junior or senior year. Highschool is the time to enjoy yourself as a kid and experience everything kids do before they grow up. Don't worry yourself just yet. Even my friends in college have no clue what they want to do. I hear from a lot of adults that college is the time where you find yourself...where you discover who you are and what your ultimate goal in life is. Just sit back for now and relax. Just take highschool seriously (but still have fun) and whatever you decide to do after highschool will come easily to you.|`|3001gVA4aa	I completely understand you. I have an anxiety disorder and it flares up ever now and again. When I was a freshman I could not imagine leaving home. It was so scary to me! I couldn't imagine leaving my mom forever. All my friends would talk about how they hated their parents and my mother and I have always had a good relationship.    Trust me, one day you will want to leave. Maybe not far. FOr instance, I go to college like 10 minutes away from my mother. I'm not that far, and she still helps me out with stuff as I learn yo live on my own. Moving out doesn't mean no contact. It can be as much or as little contact as you want. I see my mother at least once every other week or so. It also does not always mean leaving your home/town. Like I said, I live in the same town. I know it is annoying, and that fear may not go away for a bit, until you're mind begins to feel more comfortable with the idea of moving out.    I hope this helped.|`|46e2a496285e8eb37e4ada2aac6111b8aa	Please do yourself a HUGE favor, and not just hear the advice everyone is giving you, LISTEN to it. Believe it.|`|eoZJO3J8aa	wait until you graduate.   go to college and find a part time job.  that way you could entertain your mind in HW and in your job.  that way you dont have to leave home, pay rent, bills, or cook your own meal..  Bcuz im sure your parents do all that for you. yes parents could be annoying and sometimes you feel like getting away from it all but just hang in there for a couple of more years (2-3yrs) until you know you are truly ready to be on your own..|`|Qj1i8NXnaa	Its good that your thinking ahead instead of waiting until the last minute. You can do anything you chose, just apply yourself. It won't be easy but i believe you can do it.
U1chPjvPaa	Because your husband noticed, means you were being obvious.  It does not mean it was something special and you should act on it.    Allot of times in a marriage you will feel twinges of feelings for another person, for what ever reason, maybe you were bored or ignored. It's not a good idea to act on these thoughts, it will pass and you will be glad you didn't screw up your marriage.     Try to focus on all the good things with you and your husband.  Maybe its a good time to go on a long weekend or at least a date night.    good luck|`|t5lwrC9Caa	sound like you want this person|`|c6a9a1a3c9c51130f64f579fb6522cf3aa	sure, why not? isn't that how most, if not all, affairs start?  why would it be impossible? humans are fickle creatures.|`|BBlfetz3aa	like already mentioned go out just the two of you and see if the chemistry returns. also try to steer clear of the other person for a little and see if it just an infatuation or actually true feelings

This is because you think that they do love you and than they take your heart and crush it. When you are fighting hard to get someone to love you is different because you haven't won them over yet and that bond and trust isn't there yet. Being cheated feels like someone just stomped over everything good in your life, while not getting someone to love you is just a let down. Whatever you figure out remember that there are plenty of fish in the sea, and I am speaking from experience.|`|XchMS5o3aa	I say the first one...

AA10423276	I'm sorry you endured so much emotional pain. it must have been a terrible feeling to lose all your family in one day. have you reported it to the police? do you have any aunts or uncles who might be wondering about your family too? i hope you'll find them but till then, you should find solace in the fact that we at yahoo answers are always here to listen to you and give you as much support as possible. if you need any suggestion you can always post here. are you trying to find your family or have you made peace with this reality as its been 16 years now. how old are you and what do you do? i'll pray for you specially. good luck!|`|7539ec184c5979d90293e53cc6ea20fcaa	What the F*** are you talking about?!!!!!
1Z0Lmrk1aa	If you don't want to ruin what you have, then I suggest you don't move in with him and get a place on your own or with some one else. Besides, he has a woman and I'm guessing she won't to keen on that living arrangement.|`|9jWjyKeuaa	I'm in this situation right now, except from the guys end.  I was best friends with a girl for quite a while, and there wasn't much between us at all until all of a sudden she upped and told me she liked me.  At first I was shocked, and didn't know what to do at all.  I actually had scared myself into not liking her for some stupid reason.  What ended up happening was that I came to truth that I had also felt strongly for her but by then it was too late...     Our whole issue was that our friendship would never be the same if we went out, but at the same time will it ever be the same anyways?  Really think about it, now that you think you love him will you ever be able to look at him the same way, or have the same conversations?      It's a difficult decision to make and there's no real right answer.  You just have to follow what YOU think is best, not what someone says on this site.      So my main advice to you is not to think of how it could ruin your relationship because in truth, you having feelings for him already ruined it.  Not exactly in a bad way, but it won't ever be able to be the same between you two.      So now you can take the risk of bringing up how you feel or ignore the problem.  Both have their pros and cons.  Bringing it up can result in a very awkward relationship if he doesn't feel that way about you, or on the other side it could bring you the best relationship you ever had.  Ignoring it will leave him oblivious and will, externally, keep your relationship the same but deep down you might really hurt, especially if you let it build inside of you for a while.    I hope this helps!|`|RvmYqQtRaa	Nothing or tell him honestly how you feel and as your best friend knowing far better than anyone on here could ever he'd have a 50 times better answer than all of us combined. that's the biggest run on sentence I've ever written btw.|`|UyULJUx1aa	Wait until this girlfriend passes (and she will pass).

So if you are abiding respectfully by her rules and expectations, helping out with household chores, being diligent with school and maintaining a positive attitude, she's riding high on cloud nine.  Peace and Joy.|`|0d2f0d1dc0ce34a02a90647e43e5524caa	Nothing elaborate...something sincere. Like perhaps your time and your presence. Moms don't ask for much but only to know that they are appreciated and being listened too. Make her feel important by listening to her.|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	Before my Mom passed away, I would make her something crafty and she loved it and would hang it up or put it on her dresser or shelve right away. I would clean the house for her while she was at work so she didn't have to worry about it, cook meals sometimes (she liked my cooking more than her own...lol) When she got home at 3pm, she always looked forward to my coffee, it would put a smile on her face. Sometimes I would buy her favorite dessert from the bakery shop in the next town over if i was going that way and I always kept the litter box clean because she threaten to get rid of my cat...lol I always told her I loved her and gave her more hugs than she can handle..lol She was a Great Mom and I miss her soooooooooooooooooooooo much. Sounds like your Mom is pretty awesome too :o)|`|aLq8tT6Qaa	give her hugs whenever you think is a good time to..when she needs cheered up or when you want to thank her|`|MSJEyhSJaa	Depending on what you're good at. Make her something or give her something personal to say thanks.  I like to draw and play music, and I know my mum loves the songs that I write and cards that I make her. Give her something from you she can keep.|`|J2uxLxDPaa	easy go visit her every once in a while, get her some kind of dessert, and give her a hug when she opens the door, and then, you talk to your mom. My mom loves it when I do that.     If you're not old enough to be out of your parent's house, then do simple things, help with chores, try to do something together, watch a funny movie, as long as there is some contact, you should be fine...|`|EiX4L2xQaa	Keep your room clean and help out with chores,like wash dishes clean the house etc. that will show her just how much you care
wAGtyj3Raa	when i was a young'en i dated a guy who was.... much older. and being young i didnt know how to take things, and it warped my perception on dating for a long time... probably even still to this day.  but... you just have to pick yourself up and move on... everything in life is a learning experience, if you choose to see it that way.|`|IubfHhnMaa	yes i have i was 13 and went out with a 17  at was funnn!!|`|SNaxiArHaa	Well I'm 17 and when i was 15 I met my first boyfriend when he was 23 now he's 26 and I'm 17.

3MKHCgE3aa	A gentle, simple, short termed kiss in public is great. A long term lip lock, body kissing, etc is not appropriate in public.|`|GQ8aKXr6aa	Depends on the type of kissing    Mouth kissing is fine.. Oral sex may be a little hard to pass off though|`|epQXDf9Kaa	As long as it is not overdone, just a little kiss, it s ok. But more demonstration, i refuse|`|AA11313204	a little, but not a constant almost pornographic thing
80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Lawyers are really expensive.  Here in Virginia, its about $10,000 each time the daughter and her ex-husband go back to court to fight over things.    Court is suppose to (sometimes they do, sometimes they don't) take into account the cost of raising a child and then determine how this money should be raised based upon the income of both parents.  Notice I said "income" not expenses of each parent.  Say the father goes out and buys an expensive truck - does that mean his child support payment should go down? No.  Or if he fathers another child, should his child support payment to the first child be reduced - NO.    While you child is due some level of support from the father, it will be argued that the father already had an obligation to support his first child when he decided to have a second child.  So the burden of making enough money to support both children is the responsibility of the father.     But judges are allowed to pick the amount of child support based upon what they perceive to be the "best answer".  Nothing is 100% certain in court.|`|YvxWxJHdaa	go to the court guidlines in your state on line and look up the laws and read... both children,, all children are taken into account in a new hearing. Often the person seeking the modification if not the state is in a position to benefit by undisclosed means require discovery to be served to the other parent to make sure you get a fair hearing. Thats important read about disclosure and discovery talk to as many lawyers as you can then  speak with a privite Investigator get loads of info.|`|Dud46s2Daa	Most states are first come first serve.  If one has filed for support, they take a certain percentage of his income.  When the second order is filed they take a percentage off the remainder of the income after the first is deducted.|`|jLSHwhZcaa	Call the court house and see if you can do a modification of child support yourself. What you will need to do is fill out the necessary forms, pay a filing fee, and court cost. Each state has guidelines for child support so it is not like you will be going in to battle over  $$$ amounts. These amount has already been set.  At least this is what I did.
1vKiGBF4aa	Honestly, I think a nice dinner and a movie at your place =)|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	Get her some roses and chocalte take her to dinner no where to romantic!

GQ8aKXr6aa	The reason women complain about the lack of decent guys is most if not all) refuse to ask a guy out themselves, because society says guys should do it and hey, why waste energy?    So they wait for a guy to approach them, the problem is nice guys are usually too shy or nervous to approach a girl because most of us fear rejection.    So since we don't approach, the assholes who want arm candy/punching bags/sex slaves approach the women because they know that 90% of the time they will get the girl because the girl is too afraid/lazy to get a guy herself.      Of course that's just my opinion and I'm jaded.. but it's seemed to hold pretty true.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	what they mean to say is why aren't their any good guys that look like brad pit and do spontaneous thing and have a big penis and treat me the way i want to be treated and have a good job and a nice house and a cool car|`|FPT6pstraa	There is a main difference between what a woman say they want in a man and how they respond. You communicate to their emotions, not their logic.|`|1KajpBdaaa	lol u gots to watch carlos mencia he made an episode about this...right now all the gurls go for the badaz guys but later in life they will complain about not finding a decent guy when their badaz bf gets beat up, shot, arrested, killed, or raped..|`|h31I5hSAaa	you sound like a great guy. thats what every girl wants. its just that so many guys a pervs and DONT treat them with love an respect that it can seem like a lot of guys are not good boyfriends. start being a really good friend that will warm her up. ps girls think shy guys are really cute! it is so totally ewwww if a guy is like waaay too sure of himself and wayyy too smooth. so dont worry!|`|2QFe7onpaa	Be her friend, tell her what you think (honestly). Don't listen to the guys who obviously answered before that said act like a "badass." If she really wants to find "that guy" she will see you. Don't give up hope. Be the sweet guy that you obviously are and tell her how you feel.|`|0Q9FiDYqaa	Just act like a badass, get sum bichez|`|J5E4o0N5aa	get a harley and and a leather jacket  beat up some bad guys and the bishez will be all over you|`|47puykLGaa	cause they always fall for the bad asses and get mad when they get dumped|`|e7I0PXBNaa	Okay your such a sweetie! She had better be good enough for you! My advice would be to warm up her friends, since they are the cause of all the problems. Don't try and date them or anything just maybe be nice, smile politely, have a friendly conversation with a few of them (they aren't going to reject you cuz you don't want them). Show them the nice guy I'm sure you are. Don't be afraid to hide who you are, because the truth in a relationship is the only thing that will keep it going for a long time. Open doors, pick up books, walk her to her locker, complmeent her and her friends. Maybe the friends need some love and affection too, maybe some of your friends might fit well with them. I am sure you can do it! chances are she is just as nervous about being rejected as you are! Good Luck, I wanna know more when you guys start dating!|`|fFnfFROQaa	How about you spend less time worrying about others on what they think of others and concentrate only on you and what you want?    Who cares what her friends think.  The only thing matters is what you want and what she wants.  Never mind her friends.    You want to be with her?  Make a good impression towards her.  The one reason most of them are having crappy luck is that they are attractive to certain types which treat them like that...they like those kind of guys despite that they mistreat them...    Get over the observations, get over your shyness.  She doesn't want someone who keeps her happy and safe.  She isn't looking for a husband yet!    She wants someone to hang out with, someone who is fun, outgoing, interesting, and treats her well.  That is it.    Show her that you are of those qualities without being shy, insecure and unsure.  Win her friends and they will back you up.  Girls will turn to their girl friends for advice..so if you can win them, you can win her...|`|0dbwA1dVaa	I always say that there isn't a decent guy out there, but I know there are plenty of awesome guys out there.    The reason I say it, mostly, is because I am intensely jealous and hurt that there isn't a guy out there who likes me, or thinks of me as a romantic interest. I'm not pretty in any way. I don't believe I'm even somewhat remotely attractive. However, I'm a nice person, and yet nobody can see that... most men are too busy looking at the blonde with big boobs. That's what bothers me. I just want some guy to see that I COULD be dateable... even if I'm not pretty.     Ugh.  Sorry to vent.    God bless.
EsnFmcMFaa	hes bored with you    this girl that i talk to keeps writing so much stuff to me on facebook   i go so annoyed because she would talk about such boring things  so i just started writing less and less until it stopped    you could ask him why he does this  then you can see where you stand    ask him if he thinks you are boring|`|ZzdVlioOaa	well no offense but if guys like u they will provide the conversation, if he is just answering ur questions he doesnt like you... im sorry=/|`|bgWfcplBaa	He is losing interest.
qXiuDkzxaa	Sometimes when a girl tells you she just wants to be friends it doesn't have anything to do with you at all. Other times it does.    Maybe you should look more carefully at her situation. Has she ever been in a serious relationship? Has she dated many guys before? Is she insecure, shy etc.    Sometimes when a woman just wants to be friends she's too scared to start a new relationship and you may be able to grow on her.    The kissing cheek thing could be taken a few ways:  - You could be growing on her and she may be starting to develop feelings and the kissing thing was to let you know she's open to the idea after all  - She could be just thanking you for a very nice evening and not wanting to hurt your feelings    Depending on who she is, try reading into it the way a girl would. Is she normally the type of person to show physical affection like that? Try to get inside her head.    Good luck|`|vxhQWwaHaa	become the first person sahe texts in the mourniong...and so on   get in side her head laugh.  be sencitive and compassionate when she tells you her feelings  she is sceptical,  not much your doing the right thing  take it very slow  ur growing on her    she likes you but is confused  i      if u want ths to work then bevery slow!!!!  take ur time relationships like this take time and love...|`|kULqytREaa	dude i have had the same thing i asked out a girl and she said she wasn't ready for that tipe of relation so i would say no|`|RnQFwIuUaa	She is probably getting used to the idea of you as boyfriend potential. You can ask her why she kissed you. I know it makes for a very confusing relationship, but, if she is becoming more intimate with you, she may be changing her mind about you. good luck|`|O716Z3HRaa	You're in the friend zone, and no it is not a dead set thing, you can get out of it, but it would take too much. The kissing thing, I don't think you should read much into it unless it's on the lips, it's just a friendly kiss.
jlXPsVfdaa	Classy sexy is not slutty.|`|1KajpBdaaa	so um...ure saying ure a slut? lol jk jk ure not a slut but every gurl in ure school will sure think u are one lol|`|1kSRPadaaa	dunno, depends with who and how much you are flirting with people.     my friend thought i was a MEGA slut b4 she knew me jst cos i had a shortish skirt and i hung out with a girl with a bad rep and ya i was a virgin|`|nnQhkhhsaa	Well in people's eyes u may seem like a slut because they don't know if u have had sex b4 but if they know u then they just know u like to dress that way. so it could go both ways|`|WNskx1JGaa	Yes most definitely you are considered a slut. Especially to the guys because they feel that women who are easy to flirt with are easy to get in bed.     Also other women feel that women who flirt with every guy they can get their hands on portray themselves as low class and whorish.

z4m5LV2raa	I think this stimulus is giving money out to low and middle income earners only, unless I didn't read everything yet.    "Workers earning up to $80,000 a year can expect a handout of $950, those on a salary of $80,000 to $90,000 will receive a $650, and $300 will be awarded to people earning between $90,000 and $100,000. Those on incomes above $100,000 will not receive a bonus."    The payments are being sent out in April.
chZFmJOPaa	Alright well my story. I was talking to this guy for a while and he mentioned how he felt good about dressing like a woman for halloween.... it kinda scared me because that could lead to many things.    I ignored it and we went on a date. I seriously questioned his manliness... A guy that does that stuff is fine for girls who are into that sort of thing, but a lot of girls want guys who are manly. Who would push that stuff away.    You just need to figure out what you want and who you are. Then find someone who will accept you for that.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	most cross dressing guys are straight, and it can be fun in a role playing environment, you just need to get yourself a more open-minded girlfriend.|`|nnQhkhhsaa	Hey well i shop at hollister and those brands and people judge me becuz they think gay people shop their but i like it cuz it's expensive and at least when it's cold ur nipples don't show through.

I always laugh when I'm totally and utterly surprised. But I don't think I'd dump him.... at least not right away.

As someone else here mentioned, gender identity and sexual preference are different things, so there is no reason for a girlfriend to concern herself with your sexual orientation.  Your old girlfriend sounds like an idiot.  That said, she is entitled to seek or reject as she pleases and you will have to find a girlfriend who is not quite so stupid.

0ec82562a26aa12a1149c87e311c0d12aa	don't ask her out via facebook.  always ask out in person if possible.  it allows you to keep much more power because you see her response right away-- if she's not intersted you will see it.  plus, you aren't kept waiting which increases your stress and gives her more power.    she might avoid you here (even if she likes you).  just act cool with it no matter what (because it is often an unconscious test) and there is a pretty big chance (some chance at least depending ont he girl) that she will come around and like you once you see that you don't want to marry her and are cool no matter her response.  she has to know that you can handle her ups and downs and remain cool and collected in spite of how she is acting.|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	You asked her out via Facebook!!!.

But yeah if shes not talking to you, then maybe she wants nothing to do with you. You could try to apologize if you offended her at the party too. Let her know you're into her but you didnt know how to approach her about it. So like a dummy you tried to play it off and dance with other chicks.|`|7MzhXmRqaa	You have noo game....zero. Facebook?

Might as well get used to playing the 'I dont care' game cause it will become very useful in the future haha.    Good luck.|`|uc2jjgXVaa	It sounds like you liked him a fair bit. Here's a little food for thought:    When I look at it, I wonder why he would call you babe one day and dump you the next. What I'm saying is, his objective out of your relationship is questionable. Someone who was genuinely interested in another person would generally give a lot more effort to a relationship. The fickleness of this guy is possibly saying a lot about what he thought of you and what he could get out your being together.|`|XchMS5o3aa	Your still young... You have plenty of time to meet someone you will like, So don't even trip... Give it time you find some one new... =D
JGGbQhCaaa	Because one or the other is a control freak, has self-esteem and insecurity issues and has been taught by some means or other  that violence is the way to control or compensate. Women are usually the targets because men are usually physically stronger. The first sign of that sort of character is the time to draw the line and be ready for a quick exit.  Peace.|`|BK2ammwzaa	Abuse or violence in a relationship is about a pattern of behaviour that one person uses against another to intimidate them and to get them to do what they want. Abuse is not just physical violence. Emotional or sexual abuse can be just as harmful as physical violence.  http://www.dvirc.org.au/whenlove/infospa...    If you'd like to do a quiz on the warning signs, see the first link below.  The second link is to a page about the 'cycle of violence'.    As to why women are usually the targets.  Abuse is a pattern of behaviour that one person uses to try to control and dominate another person.  Research shows that the most common pattern is male-to-female abuse in a relationship. However, girls and women can also be abusive in relationships.    Inequalities in our society and different expectations about how men and women should behave can explain why it is most commonly boys or men who are abusive in relationships. In our society, men have traditionally been expected to be in control, tough or 'macho', dominant and aggressive.    Some guys think that they have to dominate girls and 'keep them in line' so they can see themselves as a 'real man'. Our society also encourages men to see girlfriends as their possessions, and to see sex as a kind of competition (like when guys say "did you score?") rather than being part of a relationship with another person. More on this see the dvirc link.    The last link is to a great site called no to violence for men who want to take responsibility for their violence.    I hope this answers your questions.|`|iRhNx3yhaa	When trust dies abuse enter.If two people are involved & one dicides 2 go astray,comes back some times later & the other party forgives,its a mistake bcos they don't forget and later starts the abuse.About women being victims its not true brothers are abused too only they are silent.|`|9iEzXDqWaa	Dear infamous, Most abuse starts with verbal abuse,then if the victim doesn't seem willing to do anything about it,then the physical abuse begins. Women are thought too be the weaker of the two sexes,this is why. If someone you know is being abused then get the proper help for them if they will allow you too do so. Make them get out if they want,before it gets any worst. Inform the law if you have too. Good Luck and God Bless You and Whomever Your Trying Too Help.
dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	I think that whatever works for a couple is the right answer but I believe that once every 10 days is not enough. I don't think you have a problem at all. Usually when a person loses interest in sex it has more to do with  them and how they feel about their body or their relationship.    My wife and I have been married ten years and sex fluctuates with us. We might go three weeks without having sex and then we may have sex 15 times in 10 days.     I would guess that we average 5 times a week of actual intercourse. Sometimes we sprinkle in a few things here and there that are sexual acts but not full-on sex.    The thing is that we are lucky that we both work 8-5 M-F and have weekends off. We usually turn in at the same time at night and when a man and women that are attracted to each other find themselves in bed together.... lots of good things can happen.    Don't let your wife label you some kind of a pervert. 3 times a week is not asking too much. I mean c'mon... sometimes making love is slow and patient and romantic.... sometimes it lasts 8 minutes and then you both go to sleep... she needs to be willing to mix it up a bit. Good Luck.|`|2ap4EYqBaa	I think that's a nice amount, my husband and I have sex 3 or 4 times a week as well. I'm happy, he's happy - it works! It's not abnormal at all, maybe your wife is just tired and doesn't want to put forth the energy, lol. Try giving her massages or helping her to relax in some way before hand to get her in the mood. Sometimes as women it's hard to go from mommy-mode to wife mode. But you as her husband can help that transition by making her feel sexy and appreciated! :)|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	Use to be when ever he wanted it now after 32 years together it's once a month.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	My husband and i have sex 2-3 times a week.    She is the abnormal one not you by thinking every 10 days is enough and you dont need to see anybody because you dont have a problem she does.|`|hMS2BUzIaa	Ummm it's called masturbation.  But... I think you're wife is very lucky to have someone who still wants her that much... even after kids :P  No you don't need to see a "specialist"... you probably have a very healthy sex drive!  BTW... I don't think most married couples after the "honeymoon phase" have sex 3 times a week... ("like many other men I like have sex with my wife almost 3 times a week.") I think once a week or every two weeks is more realistic... I do on the other hand think you need to see a specialist about your spelling and grammar.|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Two or three times, but only once with my wife.|`|hWuS3AlLaa	About a many times as this question gets asked every week.    Seriously, I think it is different for each couple. My house it is 3 times a week on average but we don't have little ones wearing us out every day.|`|C46DNX11aa	Married sex is usually two times a week, three if you are lucky. Sound like your wife is either tired because of raising the two kids or tired of sex with you. Are you one of those"wham, bam, thank you mam" guys.Try helping out around the house more with the kids and cooking and cleaning so that she won't be so tired.I know you may have a job but beleive me, yours is nothing compared to hers. Remember you can catch more flies or sex with honey , than with vinegar.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Male, married 25+ years, current rate of sex - 3 times/week.  Me 57, wife 62.    When younger, wife and I had it more often and more times per session.    Son-in-law, age 40, maybe 3 times per month.  His wife complains.    Each person has their own frequency.  Someone else on Yahoo tonight stating her husband will not touch her.|`|1kSRPadaaa	i would love to have sex that often, and im a chick and not even married to my guy|`|AA11313204	your normal. and so is she. my hubby wanted it a LOT more than i did too. maybe you should see a specialist together if you cant work something out between the two of you that you can both agree on.|`|6Oprylquaa	As many times as you're responsibilities allow. Only valid excuses are tired from kids or work, sick, or busy attending to a responsibility.|`|Dud46s2Daa	My first marriage was like that and by the time I got remarried, I never, honestly, knew sex could be so good and so often.|`|3MKHCgE3aa	She should be flattered that you desire her so much.   Sex 3x a week is not abnormal. Some married couples have sex daily, those that are lucky have sex more than once a day.   It really depends on where you are at in your life.  If your wife is taking care of children all day, she is tired and needs some rest.  Maybe you can give her some special attention (like a back rub, foot rub, or just cuddling) that does not have to lead to sex, but just might.  Talk to each other honestly and you may be able to solve the problem without professional help.

I am old school however--so I think giving him a nice smile and eye contact a few times and if he doesn't respond by coming over and saying hi himself would be my cue. Guys hit a certain age and wham-they have no problem letting a girl know they are interested if they are--so just get him to notice you ;p   if you choose to approach him think of him as anyone else, just like you would any of your girlfriends....he is no more special then you or any one else so try not to put him on a pedestal in your mind as that is what creates this block from being YOU.  If you like him...you know some things about him--use your knowledge to your advantage and pick a topic that you know he will be inspired to continue and make sure it is truly something you are knowledged on yourself so you come across as real and truly interested in what he is saying.  ASk open ended question too-don;t give him an easy yes or no answer cos that conversation could die quickly!Guys love a sense of humour and they love girls who are having a great time smiling and having fun--a great smile can take you very far-so can confidence :) I say get noticed...if he likes a certain band or sport that you share-wear something with the logo and just be near him and see if he notices and says something to you :)|`|0D4q4Q2Raa	Ask him if you can borrow a pencil.

aXOyK3uBaa	The problem is -->> AMERICAN WOMEN.    It's not you.    Read the paperback "The Cultural Devastation of American Women: The Strange and Frightening decline of the American Female." - by Nancy Levant.    That will answer your question perfectly.    American women have such an off-the-chart sense of entitlement - it's simply unbelievable.     I live in Calfornia, and while they seem to grow the most "beautiful" women here.... they are universally the most - unattractive.... on a GLOBAL scale.    I am also non-American... and I refuse to date American women. Stick to European, Eastern European, Brazilian, and Asian women. They are much more worth your time.|`|TKHA5okpaa	I think in other contries they are used to Foreigners, but in America for some reason foreigners are usually considered jokes (especially guys), not always but usually their portrayed on T.V in a comedy style...I'm not sure where your from but say for example a middle-eastern guy in America if you watch T.V our image is that of Borat or a greasy hairy guy with gold chains and lots and lots of cologne etc...Asian's are always smiling and running liquor stores etc... Even for women say a Russian woman would be considered a mail-order bride.  I know it sucks but it's true!!!! America is filled with stereo types.   So if your going to get a date your going to have to find someone who has a specific attraction for foreigners especially if you have an accent.|`|FRokosDjaa	maybe they just have a certain type and you don't fall under that for them. thats just the way it is sometimes. but im pretty sure you could find one. My friend is a beautiful blonde who has been dating a guy from Bosnia for 3 years now and she said she would never date an American guy again.|`|5MxKdoixaa	scandinavian/polish/ukranian girls don't waste time, they can be very aggressive in what they want.

ZYUpEdcqaa	haha, I think it is just a girl thing.  However I totally agree with you.  my mom asked me once if my ex boyfriend and I ever talk and I was like, no.  Why would I want to if he broke up with me?  I have nothing to say to him.  I don't get it when people do that.|`|aXOyK3uBaa	I take it you're a guy.  And you're EXACTLY RIGHT.    "We can still be friends" is just woman-speak for -->> "Please keep paying attention to me while I keep you at arms lengths for as long as I can get away with it".    Don't be "friends" with a girl. Because  a Man would rather spend his time with a worthwhile girlfriend (or lover) than a woman who is NEITHER.    Do you really want to go to the mall and watch her pick out shoes???    Please.    Tell her to get a GIRLfriend for that.  You have better things to do... and better women to know.    Cheers|`|jj9G0BBraa	Better question: Why are you dating at all? Let God choose the man or woman.|`|p4hWHIN9aa	That's only true if it was a bad relationship, hence bad break up. There are many people who are fine as friends but you date and find you aren't right for each other.|`|aC9dBaNqaa	that is not always the case sometimes two people are not meant to be together in a relationship but otherwise they make great friends and vice versa I feel like if the relationship didn't end on a bad note then why act like there was never any history between people if feelings have been resolved I don't see the problem with that but that same rule does not apply for everyone sometimes its better to let everything go|`|uFAoq4idaa	You are right. But you know woman is always a woman. Please just be patient with women. I know that when man say quit it's really quit and you can not change the situation anymore. This happened to my best friend once. Every time she and her boyfriend had misunderstanding she would challenge him to break up. At last her boyfriend had found another girl. She would like to make friend again but her boyfriend wanted to get rid of her for good. Sorry for her, as I told her to forget her ex.

UnvACqOWaa	Statistics show that couples who wait to live together or have sex until they're married are more likely to stay married.    Reason being: if you marry someone that you haven't lived with you are 100% willing to accept any flaws they have. Most people who live together before hand think their partner will change after marriage.    As for the sex thing: if you both wait until marriage to have sex and it sucks...you really don't know any better because you've never had good sex to|`|vI3Ihd6gaa	idk maybe its that guy jesus or something that everyone keeps talking about......|`|EMKuBql8aa	Most people wait for religious purposes. And the bible says this:    "Sex is God's Gift to Married People"    Proverbs 5:15-21    If you are religious at all, thats why people do it.|`|5R6sYwzDaa	...Allergic to semen? Haha. sorry . made me laugh.    Anyways...honestly, let people do what they want. If you didn't wait or don't want to wait ...then don't. It is your choice just as they have theirs. And if people are preaching to you, ignore them. It is your life. Just be safe about it of course.    It could also be cultural or religious.  Some cultures look down on people have who many sexual partners.    Some people simply want that romantic love, where they want to give themself only to one person.    It is a big deal to some people. Just like it isn't a big deal to you.  It is all personal opinion.    You should respect others views on this.  Just as I believe they should respect yours.    In the end, it's not your life. So why worry whether someone is screwing 20 people or wants to wait for "the one". I say let them be.|`|d5duruQaaa	it's either because of religion or they just want to do it right for the last time

f03976a153802da6a244397db068fdeaaa	defend her...    make others realize how it would have been if they were in her shoes!|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Its human nature. Dont worry about it.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	What is her disability???      Stand by her.  If students are harassing  her they could be in big trouble.  The school has some responsibility to make sure that this doesn't happen.    People are ignorant and making fun of someone with a disability is just wrong.  It is also very bad for your karma.  When I was in junior high, I slipped a disc in gymnastics.  I was out of school for 3 months with a private tutor and then came back.  I had to wear a huge back brace and some people were mean.  One girl in particular.  15 years later I ran into her at a softball game.  She came up to me and apologized over and over.  2 years earlier, he broke her back in a boating accident and went through what I did.   See -  what comes around goes around.  It might take 15 years, but it does.      Be a good friend and stick by her.|`|wE89gFMfaa	Just stick by her, stand up for her when you can, and make sure she knows that you're her friend no matter what. a person who is picked on frequently is likely to have pretty low self esteem and having one or more steady friends is definitely a good thing for them.|`|q7I1Ek3kaa	support her, comfort her if she knows she is being picked on. And if she does or does not know, defend her!|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Be there for her as a friend. I was notorious in middle and high school for speaking out and defending those who got bullied, because I was bullied as well. I always found it easier to stand up for someone else more than I stood up for myself. My grandma used to say "God does not expect much from those who were not given much, but he expects much from all those he gifted." Whether you believe in God or not is not the point. Follow your gut instincts. If your gut says "Back those bastids DOWN" do it. Spend time helping her to learn to stand up for herself. It's all you can do. Humans can be very cruel. Sad but true. Good for you for being concerned for her. That shows good character.|`|WyasZnFCaa	find a cure for her disability duh silly :P
7IbT8cUiaa	Check this out- Get your story straight and if he put his hands on your little boy, give him his walking ticket- if he would hurt a child he would hurt you without a minutes thought|`|AA11313204	what a stupid question. you should press charges on the guy and appologize to your kid and never see the guy again.|`|chZFmJOPaa	Leave him/her! He/She's hurting your child. He/She might be a nut case haha.|`|3MKHCgE3aa	Dump them. Your child does not deserve this treatment and you shouldn't tolerate it.  Keeping this person in your life is putting your child in danger.    Find someone who knows how to treat you and your child with respect, not the way you described.|`|RZfDrdIRaa	You already know what needs to be done!!! Your child is a small version/extension of yourself!! I have to wonder?!?!? How are you being treated???|`|AA11391968	You do not say how old your child is and why your bf became so angry with him.  I think you should provide the facts so we can give detailed answers.
lg8gqyWVaa	i noticed that too! oh and when you eat their food it tastes like their house smells. ew my grandmas house smells like vitamins lol.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	because people who live in the house, SMELL...all people smell. So do their pets, their food, their clothes, their furniture..everything in the world has a smell...did you just notice ???|`|fdP9UJOsaa	lol yea i've always noticed    Some people like to use nice air fresheners and others are just old fashion (love to use the window). I honestly have no clue as to why to happens but its one of those things that reminds you of home.|`|89lEF1bwaa	ive wondered that to. and also why doesnt your own home smell diffrent?|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	It's butt gas from what they eat|`|y93pJSi1aa	Simply because each family has a different lifestyle.    It can be the products they use and when they use them, or it can be what's around the house.|`|ZeKnInbjaa	it's the combination of products used. I sure hope my family and I are known for smelling like potpourri febreze...lol|`|oM0mUoW5aa	I HAVE NO IDEA BUT ID LIKETO KNOW    maybe their laundry soap...food they cook/eat.. candles they light.. incense they burn..|`|1kSRPadaaa	pheramones?  air freshner?    i dont really know|`|bITTzzcVaa	Each house has its own scent because we all cook different things, wear different perfumes, have different types of pets, use different cleaning products, have different air fresheners, and all of us put off different smells.|`|KEbn0z4uaa	hahahahha coz of hygiene it's the pplz odor! the penetrating smell of cultured food! all sort's of little stuff like that goes along way!|`|c6a9a1a3c9c51130f64f579fb6522cf3aa	body odor (doesn't necessarily mean stinky, sweaty smells).  unless they OD on glade or febreze to make their house smell nice.|`|G3NqFgYlaa	Different People: Different Smells    Your nose isn't familiar with the scent and you easily sense it and adapting to it. For say if you were in your own home somebody else would smell it different and you wouldn't be able to tell.|`|29sXUFETaa	smells of their perfume/cologne, incense/candles,shampoo/ personal hygiene, food/breath, materials of everything mixed together. and stuff in the air.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	Yes, no two people or families use the exact same combination of soap, laundry detergent, cleaners, etc. Also every person's body secretes pheromones. They are like fingerprints, in which no two on the planet are alike.|`|XADP739faa	Yeah i noticed that, no idea why|`|yV5xKI0Xaa	different soaps, shampoo, and the other more yuck stuff lol, deodorant, insence, food, animals,

3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Match.com and Yahoo Personals are the most popular as far as I know. Unfortunately I live in a smallish, somewhat isolated rural area so there aren't enough women on any service.    Keep in mind that eharmony.com is more or less intended to be for religious people.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	lavalife|`|AA11441704	eharmony is too long..........match.com...........I'm not sure.................others i don't know .........|`|b8LM28bVaa	adultfriendfinder.com|`|XhpLwjCuaa	I hear a lot bad about fling and random spam i would go AFF, but meh I think dating people you can see is better but to each his own.|`|X1YVUA5oaa	adultfriendfinder and fling are scam sites, I can't believe someone recommended them. I would try chemistry.com, it's not cheap but I think it's a decent site, and I actually did meet a girl that I was matched up with on there. If I'd of stuck with it and kept subscribing who knows how many I'd of met by now.  I've never tried match.com so I guess I can't really say which one is the "best". I'm on E-Harmony right now and I'm still deciding if I like it or not, only been on it like a month.  I disagree with DM, online dating is not just for loser girls, that is old old old early 90's thinking, look how many people are happy that have met on E-Harmony.|`|0b5OTYbeaa	pornhub.com    F.u.c.k real people just masturbate!|`|pkcuVg3Oaa	fling.com|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	Uh, out in the open if you ask me.

I've gotten a lot of emails and I cant read them till I pay $30 a month for it!!! I really want to, but its expensive.... So I'm not sure. Maybe someone can answer this for me too lol.|`|82SHBZ82aa	plentyoffish.com|`|k86KdyYOaa	Since myspace is the most popular internet service, I'd say that, even though it isn't a specialised dating site, I guess it could still work.|`|fFnfFROQaa	Depends on what you are looking for.  If you are looking for hot looking and/or sane women, don't go for internet dating sites. Hot looking and/or sane women have no issues on finding dates so they wouldn't be advertising themselves on internet dating sites.    Social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook are your better sites to look for hot and/or sane women.  It isn't a dating site, it is site where they chat with friends near and far, show their interests and stuff which are far more informative than those internet dating ads.|`|FXHJSvGLaa	person.com is a good one. and hi5.com but that's more of finding friends but that's where i found my bf and we have been together for 2 years now
4W8fHj5Gaa	proably need more sleep bud. thats what happened when I seemed to care about how others looked. after I got some sleep I was fine again, it really does mess with your mind. maybe just focus on what they're saying and how their voice sounds instead of the clothes or wtv that they are wearing. Goodluck.|`|eUeTEmCeaa	ya I am 20 and never kissed a girl.  Im in college|`|0wkUKcUuaa	-_-  yu just answered your own question !        &* yes highschool sucks .|`|gRsuXxkbaa	way to answer urself there|`|RnQFwIuUaa	You're right, high school is a tough time. There are so many undercurrents and rules that it affects the way you talk, dress, feel, act, etc. Many people don't like the time there. You are not alone. Do you mean you care about girls looks or what groups people are in? The girl is just a person, she likes when boys talk to her. See if you can start a conversation with her, or at least say hi and how are you today. Good luck|`|R1vos19Caa	I know what you mean bro.... I have like ...reverse body dismorphic disorder or something. cuz I'm ugly as hell but I think I'm the sexiest thing in the world and I think most girls in hollywood are ugly too:P
JGGbQhCaaa	If you and your ex are clear and he understands and appreciates your love for the family,  and if the family understands and loves you, that's all that's necessary.  If you had that kind of relationship with them while the relationship was on, it ought not be too hard to keep it going.    The openness or closeness of the mind of the ex could be the critical factor. If he knows it's over and why it's over and can move on maturely, you should have no problems. Otherwise it might be awkward for a future beau that you might want to bring around. Good luck. Peace.|`|ZeKnInbjaa	call his sister periodically and just chat sometimes. Other times why don't you and her go to movies and shopping and all? Go see his dad and take him things like freshly baked cookies or just go over to cook and visit sometimes. My cousin's ex and I are are still best friends after a loooooong time. His wife finds this bizarre but she and I have been close friends for so long that it wouldn't make sense to stop...we are like sisters!|`|BBlfetz3aa	as far as your ex is concerned, who cares what he thinks/ feels. as far as you future bf it would be very weird if coming into a relationship and a girl is friends with her ex in laws. i would be weirded out . but that is just me.  basically its ok for now but later may be a problem
a22e2dd3dac334f4cdeb57e3ca3f55faaa	i like the ligghter idea, lol,  but it wont work and she will think ur nuts...    will you be my gf  never works man,  unless she really likes you and your like 13...          drive her around and watch the sunset,  then  kiss her and tell her how much u like her more than anyone else,   get her a pink rose too c0ck boy
XfjoDHo2aa	keep doing what your doing eventually you will find the right guy there is no since in going around chasing guys and wasting your time if the guy is worth all the effort of chasing then go after him othewise just wait ......|`|Tao9nkkiaa	M male 18 n alone.can u be my frnd.?mail me at monish_sippy@yahoo.com.am waitng for ur reply.byee..|`|AA11812482	us guys like to be approached...it shouldnt be to complicated, dont overthink this|`|8ltKj9VKaa	I SERIOUSLY USE TO THINK THAT WAY...2 but the truth came to me that guys were intimidated by me because i am so pretty and they think i might bite or really hurt there feelings or even when you come on to strong....because im a scorpio and some people think there mean but n e ways yea your totally fine it just that it take sometime and you need to open up a little bit and just be nice to the guys and tell them ur name or go out some time have fun FOR LIKE GOODNESS SAKE GRL.
WkfuwUVRaa	both. but i think the scruffy look is cute. with a little shorter hair than  you described, though.|`|cj8iM1Olaa	You think men in the military are women...    You fail|`|VSnj6b7zaa	I prefer a guy with clean hair cut and trimmed and clean facial hair. That's just sexy and it shows he cares about himself.|`|JO3HiGfHaa	From my experience (not sure if it's just what fits me better then the other look) most girls like short hair all around and no facial hair... this is just what I've always been told about me, it could be different for others.    I think clean cut short hair is more professional, are you trying to tell me police officers are women?|`|IXCAJdBiaa	clean cut is always my preffered choice not a guy who looks girly but has a "fresh line up" type guys and long hairs cool if can pull it off like troy polamalu|`|Fls9Zwr4aa	Personally i like shorter hair but a little scruffy on the face. i just find it sexy on a guy.     But every girl is different with their tastes.|`|f17RG50taa	clean cut~~ neat looking people gives a better impression
UAWiu1hUaa	well since im NOT into theater and nothing like that i wouldnt be upset..  but for YOU i can deff understand why ur feeling this way.  UR NOT CRAZY!!!  that is redic someone would do that.  im sorry.    i graduated 08' as well haha|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Yes you are rational and no you are not crazy.  I'd be furious at this creep.  Did they catch him?  Does anyone who did this?  Find him and string his butt up by the rafters.      It is unfortunate that future grades won't be able to read the fond memories from previous years.  Is there any chance that someone took pictures of this wall maybe for a yearbook?  Apparently your friend that told you that you were being ridiculous doesn't realize the affinity you have with the theatre.  It was a comfort and home and some creep came in and desecrated it.   I'd find out who he is and then write to the revenge guy for some creative ways to get back at him and teach him a little respect.  Sorry.  You still have the memories in your heart.|`|wAGtyj3Raa	not at all!!! i would be very angry if something happened to my sanctuary|`|gNfpw9imaa	It is most definitely NOT irrational for you to be upset about this!  The theatre was YOUR special place.  As you said, it made you feel like you belonged...like you were accepted.  Being attached to something that important to you--especially if it made a huge difference in your life-- is not being stupid or irrational.  It's called having depth to your soul; being able to hold on to something so close to your heart is good.    But just remember that no jerk with a spray can and a few paint brushes can erase the memories you had there and make you forget about the "good times" :]|`|AuclJaXHaa	This isn't ridiculous at all! High school is a huge time in your life and the memories will stay with you forever. And that is just it, the memories will stay with you forever. As much as it sucks to have those "physical" or tangible memories "covered up" they will always be there in your mind...and the people you shared them with will keep them as well.
qeUoAW6naa	Don't be scared. Be brave, and ask him out. I mean, what are you scared of? What could happen? The worst that could happen is, he might turn you down. Would that be the end of the world for you? No! I would expect you to take that gracefully too, and to move on. So just ask him, and see what happens. Start off with casual suggestions, like going for a movie or coffee or something. See how he reacts. And it's not yet time to give him anything for Valentine's yet. Wait till you are an item. Only then is a person worth buying stuff for. Good luck!|`|5k7BexD3aa	take this to singles and dating|`|hWuS3AlLaa	Your links are worthless, looks have nothing to do with if two people make a good couple and if you want to get him a gift, make it simple, like a card or a big Hershey Kiss.|`|NOhfm4qdaa	For some reason the picture didn't pull up. Most guys would be flattered to receive a unexpected Valentines card. Keep it simple and not to mushy. Make sure it indicates in a subtle way that you look at him as possibly being more then a friend. Girls don't be afraid to make the first move. My girlfriend pursued me because I wasn't reading her intentions correctly. I though see saw me as a friend only. I had no idea she was into me. Because I would have made the first move if it didn't seem like want all she wanted in friendship. Mixed messages are confusing. We've been going out for 5 months and I'm truly in love with her.|`|1o3OqSioaa	If you are not dating him, then do not buy him a present. You will look desperate, will lose face, and he will not respect you.  Guys love the chase! If you throw yourself at them, they will see you as an easy booty call, and quickly become bored with you.  Guys love girls who are hard to get (not impossible) but ones that they have to chase and work on getting, because guys love to win, including their women's hearts.  Good luck, and play it cool. You will win your hearts desire soon enough.|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	No, not if the person you are asking out is the girl. Ikkk!!!
a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I would contact their consulate and admissions of foriegn affairs.
mqjj1O3Saa	Ahhh..    ive done this beforee..kinda  hahaha  i got over it..    im guessin she will too.      just keep telling her  and get her friend to tell her too...
QY10Hmq7aa	Haha.. that's funny. She's so full of it.|`|WRbbpRZzaa	She's just embarrassed.|`|AA11371251	my mom is the same way and I will vouch in all my 23 years I've never heard my mom pass gas but she constantly complains of stomach problems so I'm guessing that has a lot to do with it. Your girlfriend might not but she'll regret it. haha!|`|8bETrOtqaa	Because women dont find farting lady like, therefore some women dont own up to these things|`|eUeTEmCeaa	fart haha|`|HuJmTs8xaa	She's lying. Girls think that it's nasty that they have to fart like everyone else, so most of them hide it and even act like they don't use the bathroom, which is totally weird. She does, everyone does.|`|MgiK02Zbaa	ahahahahahaha! everybody farts.|`|1gJ92tJaaa	everyone farts and burps it happens it needs to happen. shes just shy.|`|I0g24Jmkaa	haha, she's probably ripping them when you're around.|`|odiTRvpvaa	HAHAHAHA  shes just trying to be lady like in front of you. its not really sexual to admit to your boyfriend that you fart. but trust me. its normal. and everyone does it|`|dzDWmq9Paa	bull ******* ****!|`|qdsVS1dDaa	For some reason, gals do this much less than guys do. I have never heard my wife fart in 8 years.    Regards,  Dan|`|XfjoDHo2aa	its normal for a girl not to want to fart around her man but admitted girl you do fart as well as all the other goody good girls lol|`|Oi8Oh6zHaa	Shes in denial. Of course she farts. She poops too---TMI though.|`|SghwXlQ9aa	Of course it's normal. Everyone farts and she is just denying it.|`|JO3HiGfHaa	Girls don't fart nor do they poop. Have you been living under a rock?|`|beTBfCkTaa	yeah..but its embarassing so she just doesnt want to talk about that. don't ask her about it.|`|AA10718199	it is normal you cant not fart, but maybe she hates doing it for some reason|`|XADP739faa	she probably gets embarassed lol.|`|F5gtYbDVaa	shes mentally retarded and deaf..  that might just be the problem. i am sorry to inform you.|`|YqSI2j90aa	dude. everybody farts. its a normal process.|`|q6NGnYjJaa	Well everyone farts, she may be embarrassed to talk about her farts|`|z7l0BF1raa	ha ha ha!~ fart on her! she just doesn't want to admit it just drop it.|`|1hlIzEnTaa	She's lying through her teeth  haha  unattractive yes, but necessary|`|KAXWo7Baaa	its normal but who would actually tell you that she farts. to be honest i don't want my girl to tell me that she farts either|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	dude if she doesn't fart then her belly would be huge with gas and it'll probably pop!    She doesn't want to gross you out but saying that she doesn't fart that just freaks me out she an't normal!!!|`|y93pJSi1aa	dude, I was in a relationship for 3 years and I didn't fart in front of my girlfriend, and she didnt in front of me. Its just the whole embarassment factor you have to get over, it isn't something you should be concerned about at all.    Personally flatulance shouldn't be something everyone is so concerned about I mean its natural and necessary, but hey thats society for you.|`|hzBILdNvaa	Farting is most definitely normal.  My brothers girlfriend is the same way.  She feels that farting is a really disgusting thing and swore that she never did it... until i cooked up a nice big batch of chili one night when they came over for dinner.  I heard that the ride home was ....lets just say musical even though she tried to hide it.    I think a nice big bowl of chili would help you in your quest for the truth.    Good luck|`|t5lwrC9Caa	normal she just don't fart around you when i was in the philippines i didnt fart maybe it was all of the rice hehe|`|chZFmJOPaa	Well she's making herself look stupid.|`|5f6c8f16d3b0eff919c4db41f4c72b72aa	She's lying.|`|IXCAJdBiaa	...yes all girls do fart shes probably just embarressed about it....jsut let her know u dont care and let them rip together...! ahahah|`|LMMsjn6aaa	shes lying   farting is natural and happens to everyone. she just doesn't talk to you about it because she is embarrassed.|`|AA11714512	I read a science books about things like that and it said the average person farts 11 - 12 times a day.|`|WPVpOfuwaa	just a priss.|`|Bngsrgpgaa	It's embarrassing!|`|AA12213723	u guess some girls just try to be perfect for their men,even if they must lie or suffer for it?give her a break and let her believe that she's almost perfect this time.plus, it's pro bally your fault anyways?she's trying to say the right thing and do the right thing, so you won't think she's gross or something?the stuff we go through just to please our men?are they really worth it?|`|dsiuzvTHaa	believe me if she doesn't fart at all she would be dead cause a humans body has to release some of the gas in our bodies.
k47vgSLKaa	ignore him...he'll be back and if he dont come back then his loss .....but ignoring him for a while should work.. Wateva u do dont hit him flirtingly i hate it wen that happens to me|`|FJ6960c8aa	show some **** and ***... the dude will be all over you like bees on honey,|`|e7I0PXBNaa	make sure he knows you mean a date, and try to work with his schedule,if he cant make time for you then chances are he's not as interested. Its weird but most guys like to be chased, instead of doing the chasing... what is this world coming too?|`|chZFmJOPaa	Ask him straight up. =]|`|zt0wLQzVaa	sorry but it sounds like hes just not into you =[|`|sLGlL17naa	ASK HIM. Go for it. He probably wants to ask you but just doesnt have the courage.|`|8YNLZp5Faa	ask him and if he says no or is too "busy" forget about him...|`|pkcuVg3Oaa	Just come out and tell him that you like him and invite him out for lunch or something. What's the worst that can happen? He'll turn you down? If he turns you down, it obviously wasn't meant to be. At least you'll know that you tried.
duupRLplaa	I can't answer why exactly it is that way... since the feeling hasn't changed even after you and your girlfriend are back together, it could be just a weird phase thing. Lots of people feel that way at some point in their life and can look back at it objectively in the future. You should talk to your girlfriend and try being more open about how you feel. She might be able to advise you... or at least take your mind off of it.    We're human, so we're pretty much born hollow. Jesus fills up the empty space. That's just how its been for me.|`|3jWaexYOaa	maybe it never settled in yet your trying to deal from the pain from the break up that -which hurt you a lot you cannot function straight now ... don't worry it will hit u..trust me your not a monster... its happened to me before everything but the diagnoses (sorry about that)|`|mHZvOhsDaa	uh depression?? i dunno.. thats something you gotta figure out cause we cant visually see you..    something is bothering you tho your right about that ;P    but uh.. maybe its because your gf, the 1 your getting back together you dont feel is going to last and its temporary? if that be the case your gonna have to think hard about you forming a relationship. its better to stab your heart now before it gets "2 big" and hurts more..  the more you dig yorself a hole the farther you fall into it.|`|AA10090215	cause thats the way the cookie crumbles|`|uUWdxKSWaa	Y'all ****** gay|`|Pq14cO3Faa	Im really sorry about what's been happing to you.

Be sure to tell him that his ex girlfriend was harrassing you and that you had no choice but to say some things to shut her up. you weren't trying to brag to her, but you were trying to get her off your back.

jchCJZxTaa	ok well they are over parenting if your 16,   parents sometimes dont want you to grow up too fast thats why they do these things, maybe get one of your friends parents to brag about how good their kid has been even though they go to bed late.  or get your friends to talk to randomly talk to them like if you have a sleepover or if they comme over for th day... ask them to just randomly say something like:  you say "whatd you do last nyt?"  they say "watched this awsome show and its very educational! yet fuuny"    you wouldnt have to actully watch some educational show but it should ease your parents down,,  and no offence to your parents (even theough they no best for your well being) i am pretty sure its 8 hours sleep!    hope i helped and goodluck!|`|Z0KQenm9aa	if they yell at you ... your room is a good place to be away from them... it does sound unreasonable to make you go to bed at that time even on the weekends... i am sure they want the best for you but perhaps you can ask them about a later time to go to bed on friday and saturday nights...|`|q6NGnYjJaa	wow that is a little odd, but the `best thing i can recommend is to try and sit down with your parents and have a talk with them and express how you are feeling. They are not going to change right away but should start seeing results in little steps. Hope this helped.. Good Luck!!!!|`|AA12213723	go to bed, give them a break from kids, i know you believe 16 is grown-up?well, your almost their, but 16 year old can be very stressful on adults or parents, they pro bally want you in bed so they can have some quiet time?so, do as your told, soon you'll be old enough to get your own place, then your bed time will be in your control?|`|hj4fXGH9aa	hhmmmm.....hi, i read your question and i was just trying to figure it out......i was just wondering whats your parents background? where are you from...what religion are you?. but 8:30 is very early for a 16 yr old but what time do you have to get up every morning?. and its healthy to have 8hrs sleep a night not ten...|`|WcvVMCSOaa	well the just want the best for you and in the long run it will pay off  trust it is nothing out there but trouble these days
f03976a153802da6a244397db068fdeaaa	tell them that you don't like the idea.. it won't be possible...    or let them know that you're gay...|`|9LoHPvopaa	they're not your friends! that's all|`|EIr9e67eaa	TELL THEM 'FXCK NO , *****'|`|kcbEWzYwaa	Just let them know that your not comfortable drinking. Especially because of your age. This is called peer pressure. Everyone goes through it.     As far as you being gay, do they know that your gay? I'm assuming that your a girl and that you have feelings for these girls. Just assuming though. Sorry I'm not trying to offend you. Its ok to be gay. I'm bisexual and some of my friends are gay too. So its okay.     Hope I helped a little bit.|`|5nQjGlkVaa	WTF,, there the reckless one's they wanna get drunk..|`|CDpwCvmLaa	I started drinking at 14. I regret it, I've done stupid things.    Please don't allow them to do it at your house. Don't make it easy for them, let them be responsible for it themselves. Tell them how you feel, tell them that you think they'd be better off without the alcohol. If you feel like punishment will benefit them, tell a trusted adult. It's not the best solution for everybody, it really depends on who they are.    When I first drank, my throat burned, I ran out of cash, I ended up vomitting in a car and I woke up with a wicked hangover. It was enough to put me off getting drunk for eternity. If they choose to go against your advice, they'll regret it too.    PS: Dude - the fact that you care so much shows that you're a really good friend. Good work. :)
sr7jX2wYaa	If you have no agreement on medical cost for your son, you can ask her to pay 1/2 . Since you share 50/50 custody, if  she says no, I don't think you can force  her  to pay 1/2. But maybe  before  future medical bills   come up you may want to go back to court & get an order  that says you both are  responsible  for them 50/50*.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Divorcee decrees usually cover this kind of issue because it comes up often in divorced couples. Read your decree again and see it it spells out how to handle this situation.

Get something in writing from her (e-mail at least preferably notarized statement agreeing to pay) or at least something acknowledging the debt.     You can take her to small claims.|`|BK42HJ44aa	I would ask and hopefully she will agree that her son's health is worth her chipping in. But in the end if she says no then tell her what about last month when you asked for the money for daycare. Other than that you need to report it to the court if she is faulting in her end of the deal. But as far as the dental goes if she doesnt agree not much you can do. Unless you want to go to court all over again.|`|AA11789493	Ask her to pay for half the dental bill--actually, with 50/50 custody, everything should be split in half.  Who pays for the health insurance.  Can you get dental insurance.  Who makes the most money, or is it equal.|`|4qL7oRrVaa	Would you have asked her if she was paying child support? I think it's fair.    I would say ask her, but also seek advice from your lawyer before you call her, if you really do need the help and believe it should be a child rearing cost she should help with, you'll want to make sure you know your opions.

And I think he's correct thinking that this isn't working out - this sort of hectic, sneaking around, keeping secrets from friends, etc., wouldn't put alot of trust into you if I was the guy either - it would make me wonder what sorts of things your keeping from me too!    Let him go, however maybe ask if you can contact him again when your divorce is settled and you can date him openly.|`|vebgaPNiaa	I had a girlfriend that I really loved a lot and she was quite a bit older than myself.  The sex was great and she was allowing me all I wanted then it became an issue that I wouldn't take her out to be with my friends.  I told her that she would feel uncomfortable because at first my friends would tease her because thats the way my friends are.  I don't agree with them but I can't change them.  So, after dating for about 1 year it became hard on her because I met all of her friends and she had only met one of mine.  Slowly we became just booty calls and then nothing more after a couple of months.  I couldn't give her what she wanted and we both moved on.  It is now after being married 10 years I realize how good I really had it with her.  We parted being friends and I think she is still alive somewhere in America!  I know she would get a kick knowing that I wrote something about her.
dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	Well there is harmless flirting that we all tend to do and then there is serious flirting that becomes uncomfortable, especially in the work place. Men are attracted to women and women are attracted to men. Most of us that spend 40+ hours with coworkers tend to develop friendships with people of the opposite sex.     Sometimes you share a couple of interests or similar senses of humor... you can joke and tease a bit without it crossing the line into anything inappropriate... That is healthy. If I thought for one minute that a woman at my office really wanted to get into my pants it would freak me out and I would put an abrupt end to it.    I love my wife and that ring on my finger is not just a reminder... it is a source of great pride for me.|`|AA11391968	That really depends on the man and whose around him.  That is, how "secure" the married man is feeling.  Being happy in the marriage or not isn't always the reason.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Have worked in a lot of offices where there was a joke "Best way to keep the boss off your back, is to keep him between your legs".  These guys expected - and demanded, sexual favors.    Usual thing I have seen is if you flirt - you are expected to follow thur if someone flirts back.    I once supervised about 8 women.  We developed computer applications and had a workroom with computers around the wall.  One female employee would pick up the hem of her skirt (and slip) and raise it to her head every time I came into the room - she would say she was "hot".  I tend to count to 3, so the 3rd time she did it - I told her I wasn't hot (I was married) and she needed to keep her skirt down.  The other women heard this.  And she stopped doing it.  She did then start dating my boss, who made my life a living hell.|`|NuCu5RbTaa	i hope mine definitely would|`|ciZcjostaa	i think he SHOULD steer away, especially if the girl does not know that he is married.. for example if he doesn't wear a ring, has no photos, doesn't talk about her, etc. that happened to me and i fell for a guy that was married and eventually he had to tell me he was married. we use to flirt with each other a lot. and not only was it bad for his wife and marriage, but he lead me on to believe that something could have been possible for MONTHS. it was a real blow and hurt me a lot.    so i really agree with you that people who are married should NOT flirt unless if it's innocent flirting.. sometimes that's ok if no one has a hidden agenda. it just helps make work more pleasant and helps the day go by.|`|NOhfm4qdaa	I don't see a crime in simple flirting as long as no boundaries have been crossed. It's natural for people to flirt even if they are happy within their relationship. If he's doing this in front of you. Then he is rude. But if happens to be a little playful no lines are crossed. I say it's alright as long as you don't feel threatened by the situation.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	its not just the guy's women like that extra attention from guys too.

MLdykhQNaa	I'd recommend going back to the bar and seeing if you can run into her again or one of her friends and plead insanity.|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	Maybe, just maybe, you can try and go to that bar more often hoping that she might stop by one night? I mean it's hard finding a person in a big city so your chances of finding her electronically aren't good. I'd say just keep going to that bar, she might be there you just never know. Hope this helps man... good luck!|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Go back to the bar and look for her there. This time, hang on  to her number and don't drink as much.|`|XXplwfhVaa	myspace, flicker,....  do you know what she is majoring in? like any university? go to the university website and search her name  where she works? you can go there and ask about her  what does she like to do most of the time? for example jogging, take a jog in the morning maybe you will bump into her..    i mean anything about her other than location and name will help you ind her...
MLdykhQNaa	I think that if that's all you have to worry about in your relationship you're miles above nearly everyone else in the world.  Stop nit-picking.
80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Probably not.  If he has been doing this not only multiple times on you, and his ex's - why would he suddenly stop now unless he was ill?    I have worked in several  offices over the years and  there is always a few males out to have an affair with a female co-worker.  One guy, Fred was dating 3 women at work at the same time - and they were all married.  In my opinion, Fred was ugly and the married women he was dating were knock-outs.  I asked one of them why she was ..dating Fred and she said she got tired of him asking for it all the time so she just let him have it.    Another guy, Larry, told me he didn't want to look back one day with regret for having turned something down.  So he didn't turn down anything.  He had a great looking wife and several of the girls in the office that he dated were dogs.  He kept 5 women on staff who's main assignment was to date him - they would compete each day to see which one of them Larry would pick to go out with at lunch time for a little R&R.  I saw this go on for years.     My first experience with any of this was when I was 21.  At break time, me and 2 of my male buddies would go talk with a female secretary.  One day something was said and she told me that I should ask her out.  I told her "but you are married!".  She said "That's okay.  My husband and I have a deal - he dates who-ever he wants and I date who-ever I want."  And this was back in 1973 when things were more conservative than today.|`|Ipnnj07uaa	the guy is incorrigible......he'll never stop. y did u guys ever married u could have just lived together........and been lot more happy. this doubt must be tough to live with given his past. my view speak to him openely and find out but watch out for the reaction both in u and him.|`|AA11313204	wow. what a bastard! you gave him a chance even though he had a bad track record. i think you need to move on. you will never be able to fully trust him again.|`|8LoiVz88aa	I really don't want to say anything that might hurt or upset you...But, if you have a feeling deep in your heart that it is happening again, than more than likely, it is. I would do what any woman in this type of situation would do......Ask him. There are many ways to tell if he's lying to you, or not. If he can't look you straight in the eyes, that's one way of possibly telling..I have been in this type of situation, although I have never been married. My gut instinct always tells me a leopard never changes it's spots. If he did this to his other two wives, and then did it to you once...To the extent of moving out for a while...He very well may be doing it again and I would suggest you both seek some marriage counseling, for your own sake.....Not his. If he doesn't want to change, he'll only make you miserable in the long run. I hate hearing stories like this, especially when there are children involved. Also, go and get yourself checked, just to be on the safe side that you don't have anything from your husband. Good Luck.........|`|3MKHCgE3aa	Ask him, he told you before, but  be prepared for the answer and what you will do if he says yes he is having an affair.  If you feel it, he probably is straying again.  You know in your heart what you need to do and only you can make that decision.|`|AA11789493	Obviously, the children come first.  They didn't ask to be brought into this world, so I'd wait it out until they are out of the house.  What incentive does he have to be a faithful husband.  He has his cake and eats it too.  He's a selfish SOB, as you already know.  Stop bending over backwards to be nice to him.  Start doing some special things for yourself, including putting as much money away as you possibly can over the next few years.  Keep a journal of all of his absences and whatever he says and when the time comes kick his *** out. If you don't care that he's cheating on you and like your life, than continue on as you have--women have done it for years.  The decision is yours, but he will never change.  Don't blame this on yourself, because it is not you.|`|z7l0BF1raa	tell him your going out of town. have the kids go to there friends and show up later in the night if hes cheating you'll catch him!
X7i59NeIaa	Your question is  very confusing, but what I think you are trying to say is that your boyfriend has finally asked you to marry him but that he also wants his mother to live with you. It really doesn't matter if she likes you or not, he wants her to be part of your marriage. Where do you live now? With his parents or by yourselves? I have to say that I think this is a terrible idea and if he wants to live with his mother tell him to go ahead and do that but that you will not be coming along. I know that will not be easy because you love him and have waited for the time to come that the two of you would get married but if you marry him under these circumstances you will live to regret it. Your home will not be your home, it will be his mother's home. It will be her that makes the choices and decides where the furniture goes and even what kind of furniture you get, she will decide on the meals, not you. Everything will depend on what she wants and you will fade into the back ground. Please girl, if you want to be happy do not accept this arrangement. The price is much to high.|`|vI3Ihd6gaa	You 2 do deserve your privacy especially in your own home when you get one. Put your foot down girl and tell him whatsup =)|`|5jMNBO2naa	yes  the son is weak  he is a momma's boy  and why would you marry a son like that?  and not a man?|`|AA11313204	i agree with you 100%. without alone time you will not last long together. he needs to make a choice.|`|qeUoAW6naa	This is very unfortunate, and a bit tricky. However, don't always think that his mom just wants to keep an eye on you and doesn't trust you. do not question her motives so much. maybe indeed she needs someone to look after her. yes you are grown ups and don't need his mother to be around, but maybe she needs the two of you to look after her in her old age! and maybe having her around will indeed be beneficial to you in terms of housework etc. Maybe you will prove to her that you are not the "gold digger" that she thinks you are. Or maybe she doesn't think that way about you altogether! however, if you still don't prefer.... continue explaining to your bf that you are not up for it, and give him good reasons. if you still don't reach any sort of adjustment/compromise/consensus.... then I'm afraid this relationship may not be the one for you! I know 4 years is a long time... but sometimes we do have to take huge steps out of compulsion.|`|t1NTGuIZaa	If you don't know what top do, this is a sign to step back and take a breather for awhile.  Then, after you can think rationally, you can make a decision on what's best for you.|`|z7l0BF1raa	um ya ....I think mom needs to let you to live alone that's to much! tell him he is a big boy now mommy doesn't need to clean the house and make dinner!|`|umsyPxlEaa	Totally agree with you|`|EqTrzzixaa	if she moves in you will end up in divorce

Omgosh, awesome movie. There's a book they use in the movie called Love Dare. You can buy it at any Christian bookstore and probably Wal-Mart.

It's so sweet!|`|AA11313204	spend alone time together. go out on dates. share a secret with him. ask him to do the same.|`|3MKHCgE3aa	The longer you are together the closer you become. Working through those difficulties you talked about, help to bring you closer and makes your marriage stronger.  Taking time for each other, date night, cuddling together, and talking about the future and your dreams can make it better.|`|yptHq9gEaa	Respect each other!  I cannot stress this enough.  Yes, love, honesty, communication and all that other stuff is extremely important.  I'm not downplaying it at all.  But if you don't respect each other, none of that other stuff will be enough to make the marriage last.  By respect, I mean, don't insult each other, call each other names or make comments just to make the other person angry.  Always be considerate of your spouse and treat him or her as an equal.|`|q92ySEjkaa	I would say the best way to make your marriage better, even if it is great, is to always rediscover your partner.  husbands and wife's tend to grow use to one another and may at times do or say things that they wouldn't do or say had it been in the beginning of the marriage. Also sometimes us wife's get so use to our husbands that we tend to forget about our appearances and become normal housewife's in the sense of we never dress up for our husbands.  The best way to make things better is to treat each other, the way you would treat one another, in the beginning of your relationship.  you should grow together as well, a lot of marriages consist of husbands going out on men's nights and the wife's going out on ladies nights.  That is the biggest no-no.  If they need to meet more people they should rather go out together and meet other husbands & wife's together so that it is mutually beneficial to each one.  When it comes to difficulties, the best way to solve it is communication.  And you shouldn't try and Communicate in the heat of an argument.  When you and your partner is sitting at home and it may seem like there's nothing to talk about, that's the time to communicate about the things you'd like to change or rearrange or just plainly things that might get you worked up.  Also when communicating keep in mind that its just communicating and not a time to pass blame...      I personally believe that any man and woman who decides to get married can be happily married, because if both are willing to put in a 100% and if both focus more on their partner than themselves they will keep each other happy.  If both partners make it their challenge in life, to fulfill their partners needs, they will have a lasting, happy and succesful marriage.|`|jswDLpJzaa	try to keep talking, stay open & honest. don't get easily offended, don't be a suspicious person....    try to make him happy, & hopefully he will do the same... marriage now seems more like a board game than marriage.|`|EKL9JCL9aa	laugh together but dont be afraid to cry together too. Keep open lines of communication and dont lose yourself.
jswDLpJzaa	ok i know ill get a lot of flak for giving my honest opinion here but, I was raised by my grandparents, very old fashioned, very christian. I was raised to believe that a woman who is married, is to respect her husband in all ways. he should take her opinion into consideration but the man is the head of the family & it is a wife's job to love, respect, & obey (as long as he is faithful, & not abusive & she is not the sole breadwinner, then tables are slightly turned, its also biblical... research it.) the head of the household, as is the mans duty to love respect, & obey Christ as he is the head of the church.    I really am not a church goer any longer, & have no business preaching, so I don't, & i dont only think that a woman is to obey her husband "just because it is written" but I am traditional in my mindset.    If you have a traditional wife, & traditional marriage, then the choice is up to you on allowing her out of her duties. but if she also works & contributes to the household financially, then you both need to share duties, & if you want "to be thoughtful" you can take over some of her usual duties several times a month.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Women dont have to obey their husbands    She is a grown woman not a child.

They learn to obey the master. Get it Dude? Women are not dogs---they do not need to obey because they are not property.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	I think your man card is up for review.|`|AA10461616	Hmm.  Do you even have a wife?  I am thinking not as women don't "obey" very well.  In fact my husband and I had traditional marriage vows with a few things added.  We for got to take out the part where the minister asked if I promised to obey him.  So, when he asked, I said "NO!" and everyone laughed, including my husband.  We had already been together 3 years at that point so he knew it was no negotiable. ;)      Be a good husband.  A good husband wouldn't even want a wife that obeyed him.  If you love her and treat her right, she will do much more for you than if you are silly enough to think she is going to obey you.  YOU try doing something like running errands and cooking dinner for HER pretty often and you won't need words like obey in your marriage!|`|rH33ty23aa	No wife should have to have "get out of obeying me free cards" are you kidding me?

If both of you are working I dont believe it would be fair for her to get home and still do the household chores. Think about like sex... do you want to be left with all the "work" put into it? I belive not.. it feels better when your partner put their share in the "work". I do hope you are able to understand where I am coming from. Also make sure next time you watch your words because they can be taken into a wrong aspect and I dont believe you want to come out as a dog.|`|AA11789493	I didn't know that spouses owned each other like master and slave.

I don't like you at all.|`|4szonXiRaa	When I first read this...I thought...  Are you kidding!?!?  Then I tried to delve deeper...  Most women hate the word obey, because men have used that on women far too long!  (And did not even take their wives (ideas/opinions) into account).    Far too many men use the Bible for an excuse to control women!  In the Christian culture the men do not read the scriptures well enough!  Women are to submit to their husbands.  (Men far to often, ignore this part)...  that men are to (lovingly) submit to their wives!  WIVES ARE NOT TO BE TREATED LIKE   FOOTSTOOLS OR DOORMATS!  Men are to be the "spiritual leaders" as well as the business leaders  of the home.  And I do believe that if the man does not excel in the business area he can delegate those decisions and tasks to his wife if she is more  capable.  A man should love his wife into submission...through his loving-kindness  and his gentle ways and be with her in patience and long suffering!    It would be kind of fun for a man and a women to have what I call... "slave" cards.  That is where a women does a task for the man that she does not  traditionally do!  This can be practiced by the man also!  Example:  You could really use your immagination with this one!  You could have 10 cards for the man and 10 cards for the woman.  If a man and women are both sitting down and the man says...  Will you go get me a drink or draw my bath water?  Then they could turn in their "slave" card for doing something that they  do not have to do.  Then the next time the women might be busy reading or something and ask her husband to get her a drink, give a backrub, etc. and he could give her a card for doing something unexpected.  Then you could take inventory in a week and see who has the most cards left!  Sounds fun!|`|EqTrzzixaa	you are an idiot, i don't believe this is how you think at all, you are an attenion seeker and all you want is for women to go ape sh*t so you can laugh...quit waisting yours and everyone elses time........if you are serious, your wife needs to b*itch slap your stupid ***|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Mr. Jefferson forgot that husbands are to "Love their wives as Christ so loved the Church and gave Himself for it".  Christ died for the Church, how many husbands are willing to die for their wife?    The word "subject" means that a wife is to RESPECT, NOT obey.|`|9cTlVoVXaa	NONE!!! Are you kidding me... get back in the kitchen. LOL    I'm joking, but the question does lend itself to some humor.     Nevertheless, if asked differently... my response would be that at least once a week you should do something for her that she usually does willingly for you (i.e. cook, wash and/or fold the clothes, clean the house entirely by yourself, etc.).
nujen4dmaa	I'm terribly sorry you are going through this.  Its must be a very trying time with so much emotion involved.    I would be getting a refund for 2 reasons.    1.  You don't know whether this will happen again and whether he will be so willing to refund  the next time!  2.  It could take awhile to find you an eyeclean stone..your money will be tied up.  He needs to find the stone first, then you pay.    When shopping for diamonds you need to look at the stone under a jewelers loupe of 10x magnification.  Most jewelers have at least 30x magnifier in their shops.  Did the jeweler loupe the stone himself?    Can you take some detailed photographs of the setting before returning it. Most skilled benchman can replicate something fairly accurately given a photo.    You could always try purchasing the diamond and setting or just the diamond online.  There are many trusted online vendors who will run a stone through very stringent tests, give you high magnification photos and when they tell you the stone is eyeclean - it will be!  They will also work to your definition of eyeclean.     Some vendors online offer a 10 day money back guarantee, a 1 year buy back at a % of original purchase price and a lifetime upgrade policy.    You could try these guys.    http://whiteflash.com  http://goodoldgold.com    If you link to this website http://www.pricescope.com you will find Australians who have purchased online and talk about their experience in doing so...    Take heart...it is possible to find an eyeclean SI2 with a little patience.    I hope this issue is resolved quickly so you can put this all behind you.     IdealD|`|ce2d39efe7704aa1e6113b2de3007055aa	i would have a look in the other stores to see if there is a ring you fall in love with before deciding to go the refund route|`|zaSyEcnqaa	so, did you examine the diamond before you bought it? Seems kind of odd that you are just now noticing the inclusions. SI2 does mean that you may see the flaws with your eyes. I am sorry, but I cannot see you blaming the jeweler when you did buy an SI2  and should have had the chance to closely examine the diamond. Unless of course you bought it online and did not personally see the diamond. I know that my jeweler would not allow for a refund because I suddenly was unhappy with the quality of my stone due to my own negligence in examining it.   It is nice of them to offer an exchange.   I would keep your setting and choose a different center stone and be sure to inspect it thouroughly  with your own eyes through a loupe, in the natural light etc.       I examined my diamond on more than one occasion before making the final choice. I could point out every facet and every nuance of the diamond as well as the others I was looking at.     I have seen $10,000 diamonds with "pepper" in them . All the 4 c's come into play.   Just inspect closely.    Your jeweler sounds kinda lame, how could he, a professional, not have noticed this?|`|TgfSqo9maa	Hi there. Ugh, that sucks. I'm so sorry to hear that that happened to you.    I'm in Sydney as well, and a Gregory's Jeweller's store can help. We got my engagement and wedding ring from there and all their diamonds are pretty much flawless. My advice is to shop around and if you're not satisfied, go back and get a refund, though another diamond may work out better for the both of you, and much cheaper.     Good luck!    Kelly|`|uTdEdpAeaa	well the big question is who is the diamond certified with. si2 doesn't mean you can't see the inclusion with the naked eye. si2 mean slightly included and is also border line with i1. now if the diamond is certified under gia "chances" are that the inclusions would be harder to see. now my guess is that you paid around $6,400 USD which means by what you described as far as color, clarity and cut you got no more then 1 carat... you didn't mention what the carat weight here so i'm assuming that your diamond is no more then 1 carat based on the description you've supplied. if i'm correct it sounds about right what you paid for... just because you got a very good color won't make your clarity better...i've worked in a jewelry store for 7 years and i always recommend that if people are very adamant about getting a colorless then stick with a F color and nothing lower then a si1 off gia standards. gia is the most reputable diamond certification known internationally.  now if you have a budget on how much you want to spend a G color is also a very good color and is borderline with a F and if you hold the two diamonds side by side under natural lighting not artificial lighting the color between to two is very subtle if any. if you get a G color and stick with a good cut you can upgrade on the clarity which means you can get a vs2 for about the same price if not maybe a tad bit more but not excessive.  also you have to take it into consideration diamonds for some reason attract dirt like crazy and sometimes it can appear that your diamond is included. I've seen this so many time where i've seen diamonds that look very low in clarity but after i've cleaned then that diamond looks like the day you bought it.  if i were you, before i spend that much on a diamond... please educate yourself on the 4C's which you can find at bluenile.com and that will let you know everything you need to know about diamonds. the 4C's is based off gia standards so you won't go wrong there.  my advise is to never go by with the sales person tells you so make sure that you edcuated yourself before buying anything that your actually investing money into.  to answer your question if you decide to exchange your diamond for another one make sure you see the diamond under a gem scope and not a 10 power loupe therefore you'll see anything you'll need to see when that diamond is under the gem scope. but like i said before you go ahead and do that make sure you know the 4C's and understand it.  but if you heart is telling you to get a refund then get a refund because you want to be able to feel 100% sure that you made the right decision and if your second guessing for one second then the right thing to do is get a refund. once that trust is gone then it's gone.  i hope this helps you.|`|1wPnh9Ltaa	I know what you are going through; my husband upgraded my diamond for a F, SI1, "good" princess cut diamond, and I could clearly see a large black inclusion in the diamond. We traded it in. He then got me a G, SI2, "ideal" princess cut solitaire, and this one has absolutely no visible flaws in it at all! The funny thing is the color and clarity downgraded, but it ended up being a better diamond--well, at least to the naked eye! I also have a custom setting, so all we did was swap the diamond out. Hopefully you get this sorted out.

Feeling wronged, many of these prisoners have attempted to sue the prison for legal redress, but often to no avail. Federal courts have commonly cited the fact that, even when prisons deny phone privileges, the inmates are often still free to receive visits from people or send and receive letters, so their ability to communicate is not unreasonably restricted. Also, because of the many illegal activities that can be arranged over the phone, including drug deals, murder orders and prison breaks, the courts have often upheld the right of prisons to restrict phone use as a reasonable security measure    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDJ1Z5Duu...|`|avhgLEu8aa	A not very good father, that's who.|`|HBM1qu0Saa	wow, hard to say!

uwjfMV9Naa	Ohhh, dear.    First, call the elder abuse hotline in your area.  If you can't find a number for them, go through the local welfare agency.  Even if your mother is not a senior citizen, they'll be able to help - and if they can't, they'll definitely put you in touch with someone who can.  Also, if she has a terminal illness, there's a chance that hospice is involved.  Get in touch with your local hospice(s) and find out.    It's a good possibility that your mother is being abused and/or neglected by this person who claims to be looking out for her "best interest."    Don't be afraid to call the police.  Unless there's more to the story and you and your mother have a violent history, it's insane for anyone to say you shouldn't see her when she's hurting and vulnerable.  It's important that you feel as though you've said the things you want to say to your mom, and that you've gotten what you needed back from her in order for you to live a productive life, emotionally.  You never want to be stuck wondering what you should have said, what you should have done.    Good luck to you.  It might be a tough road, but if you walk down it, you'll be glad you did.|`|KEAfTavqaa	what if your mom is the one telling him not to let you in because she doesn't want you to see her this way? but seriously CALL THE POLICE!!! I am not kidding!!! or Go down to their office and tell them what is going on and that stupid husband of hers will have to let you in if there are cops with you.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	that's horrible i couldn't imaging some thing like that happening to me . maybe you can sneak into your house when he lives on day . try to ask the cops if they can do anything legally i think you have some say over things of that matter . you also might want to see if he has any life insurance things on her like if she dies he gets money|`|aGno0HAwaa	I haven't been where you have been but the only thing you can do is get into the house when her husband is not there and anyways try and see your mom.

Good luck.|`|rOzdSnYLaa	dear  Simply take the help of the law and police or take the help of your other relatives. it will work.
55oy2i5caa	I think it's perfectly fine to feel like you don't need a gf! Sounds like you are very secure with yourself, and that's a good place to be.

xDTwWM5Xaa	Just give it time|`|nRAzraS7aa	Friends hang out with friends or do you not have any|`|1B7hQ0Gmaa	She was probably too scared to come up to you alone, or shy.

She was worried about what else you might say and brought a friend to make sure you didn't say anything more.  If you want to salvage your friendship you should apologize to her for expressing these feelings, but you can't help that you feel them for her but that you would still like to be friends.  If you don't want to be friends with her if she doesn't love you back, you should leave it.  I don't think that she feels the same way...sorry.
h9U55JAFaa	Well it could be possible that he only wanted you for sex and if that is the case I would try to move on and find someone else. However, if he actually is interested in you he would be happy with just spending time with you without always needing to get intimate. Just go to public places and try not to get intimate and if he is actually interested in you he will still want to hang out and if he only wanted you for sex then he will get bored look for someone else.|`|yBnmqLZ7aa	First off, what do you want from the relationship? You don't really like him or you wouldn't have broken up with him in the first place. Or do you think you would like him as a BF now? So if you don't like him, do you want him for sex? That's fine too, but I want you to ask yourself what you want from him....Second off, quit playing games with him. You have no clue how freaking stupid it is when girls play games with guys. Maybe he had a legitimate reason for not being able to hang out, but instead you turn him down everytime he calls you now. Why? You're jealous/insecure about him and you want revenge by playing hard to get. That's just plain mean and selfish. So ask yourself what you want, and that should answer your question|`|qdsVS1dDaa	It sounds to me as though you are a cheap date, and it is just sex and hang-out.

There are resources on base to help both of you cope with the reunion and the changes in both of you. Talk to your chaplain for resource advice no matter what your religion or lack of, he is your best resource,   Hang in there, just because there is change it doesn't have to be a bad thing, it can be an opportunity to grow.

Your support and understanding is very important to him. Stay true to him and assure him that you are there to help him through everything.|`|yFKP8f0Aaa	I'm a military wife and we just got married to and he got deployed, before he left he was all lovey dovey with me and i felt really special just the way he was. he went on deployment for 6 months and when he came back he totally changed into somebody i didn't know. I've heard a lot about them guys out there that they get their taste since they are there for a long period of time if you know what i mean. I'm the type of person who's very jealous and i guess i believe people too quickly but i have my own reasons. so my husband and i are going through a counseling because i dont even know this person anymore and its sad to feel this way..i say wait and see. people act differently and who knows maybe yours will turn out to be the best husband.  good luck and my godbless hope he is ok out there. my heart is with you|`|OOL4XdjPaa	I'm not a military wife..    but I dated a guy in high school.. who joined the Marines. He didn't go over seas yet.. but after boot and some other training...     he changed. a TOTALLY different person...    for the worse.    he's brainwashed... and he's heartless now.. and mean.    he's not the one I fell in love with.            BUt that doesn't happen to everyone... he was young.. maybe his mind just wasn't strong enough to think freely
5nQjGlkVaa	im wierd too dnt worry,, tell them to FxCK OFF.
OGLulBtwaa	Um, a boy asked me to help him shoot a video for some FIU students' project. I was booming (sound) and he shot it. I live north he lives like 45 minutes south of me, and the shoot was about an hour south of him! but he picked me up and we went, the whole shoot was great, i loved being around him. Then after we went to a mall close by and we spent the money we had just made on the shoot. He took me home and that was that. We became best friends. He had to go to super north florida with him mom who was dying. While he was in the hotel alone we sat up all night and talked and i like to think i helped take his mind off his mother. He stopped by my house on his way home from the hospital after his mom passed we had our first little pop kiss on the cheek and that was it. We were young and it was such a delicate and tender moment because our love came from extreme sadness and loss. My mom and I sat in his moms place at his high school graduation and he basically lives with us now. We have been together for 2 years and i have never felt so close to, or comfortable around a person, i know that we will be together for an incredibly long time and that this is true love.|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	yes I was in LOVE big time until we got married and it turned out to be a horrific nightmare and I really dont want to get into it and I will never trust another guy again (crying)|`|KncPJwIaaa	when it happen i will get back at you
hzBILdNvaa	If I understand you correctly then you definitely have some major decisions to make.  From experience I understand how crack can mess up a person and their family and I definitely don't think that you should expose your child to anyone that is doing drugs.  At the same time, have you calculated the expenses of moving out and can you afford to move out.  Have you found out if they are any agencies that might be able to help you with food and living expenses?  Why are you not in school?    If you can find any agencies that can help you please do so and try to get back into school and get an education.    Good Luck and God Bless|`|ETo6Tv8Saa	are you 14 now, because thats what that sounds like.

That's what I did to my little sister  lol|`|Z0KQenm9aa	where are her and your parents and why are you trying to get after her when its their job... bratty kids usually have parents that dont deal correctly with their precious little darlings ... children have parents for a reason... so parents get after your children correct them teach them manners respect discipline... israel women must serve in the military for 2 years... i think its a good idea...|`|0CeBJDNOaa	spank her *** and send her to her room  to do the homework    and not to come out until it is done|`|WcvVMCSOaa	man wipe that *** and show her who is the boss|`|bKjJtSRPaa	Consistency is the only way to get a child to behave properly. When you tell a child something, they should do it, or if they don't there should be some sort of immediate punishment. What kind of punishment is up to you. I recommend time outs for everyday and spankings as a last resort when every other kind of punishment fails.
NUvc8VJMaa	Yea, i cn understand Ur feelings. And ofcourse ur thoughts are similar to me :)    i just wanna say two things for You    1st. think about yourself. why you talk with very less people? it seems you are a -ve thinker who fear about people. so if you find some good people with whom you can feel comfortable with, u are developing a strong relation with them. please just try to come out of YOur SMALL ZONE and make new friends. so that you can mingle with ppl.    2nd.     if people are neglecting you, it means U are a BORING person and they are not finding anything new in you.    If U r really selective about friends and if you dont want to loose someone   You have to tell them that THEY ARE SPECIAL FOR YOU. make them SMILE always. wish them on small ocations.  be a good listener. show interest to share their problems (sugest the solutions if you can). make them surprize with small gifts.  and last but not the least OPEN ur Heart infront of them. wht i meant is "Share your everyfeeling with them.". dont try to pretend and hide something.    Even now also they neglecting you, just LEAVE those unlucky fellows who cant understand their TRUE frnd's feelings. Because they'r not deserve Ur frndship.    All the best  Kip smiling. U'll definitely get a good frnd who understands U. :)|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Join social service organisation of your city &help people  -read more ,listen radio  -write more answers in yahoo   -study religious books and mental books  -listen good music,learn music,teach music  -learn painting ,drawing|`|el2blDi4aa	true|`|kqh8vAAeaa	JUST TRY TO DO THAT AS I HAD DONE ALWAYS IN MY LIFE...............      actually the thing is they r humans...............and we r angels....|`|AA11571111	you start to mail me, I will find out what type of man or woman are youand then can give you a suggession.|`|a1dpU3JMaa	heyy dear i can understand your feelings but listen you have to change yourself a little bit well like first of all find the reasons why people are avoiding you as i don't know you i can't tell you but you can do following things:  1 try to speak to all your mates  2 don't expect anything from anyone  3 smile everytime  4 be positive thinker  5 try to crack jokes and laugh with them  6 spend more time with them  7 tell them they matters for you  8 share your feelings with them  9 listen to them sometimes some people talks only about themsleves so listen them and respond them nicely  10 you should always ready to help others  11 don't be possesive give them some space    i think all this will help you so  good luck
ea6NWQ78aa	I have to say, I am curious what these lies were.  If he lied saying he did not have an STD for example and he did and you slept with him, then I would say that could and probably would (for me) be make or break stuff.  If he lied about the relationship he has with his family because he has a bad relationship with them and didn't want to bring you into his mess (again, just an example) that is another story.  Also, did these lies come early in the relationship when certain topics may have been "taboo" or too early to bring up to you?   You don't have to answer - they are more for you to think about.  All I can say is not to give one person soo much power in your life that he makes you depressed - easier said than done, I know.  Personally it happened to me and almost destroyed me and I am still getting over it and I don't want to se that happen to anyone else.  I wish you all the best.  -Dan|`|SNaxiArHaa	I am going through the same thing right now. The first months are always the best then things settle doing. He didn't tell you about those things because he knew what kind of effect they would have on you, which is the same with my boyfriend. But I told him that It would be better if he were honest with me that way the trust could grow and I could be able to forgive him knowing that he didn't lie to me. My bf is also my first love. In act he is my first everything and he makes my life better. Knowing that he is there makes it a lot better since my dad died and my mother is a drug addict so I consider her to be sick.  If he sees you acting like this he will be less likely to tell you things in the future which will result in you feeling more hurt if you had to find out for yourself like I have.|`|jRa5ksWSaa	Its hard to be lied to. But you might just need to take some time for yourself and fix that first. Let your mom get better, see your dad, etc. And if things have gotten this bad after only 6 months, the relationship may not be worth pursuing anymore.|`|ZcVhWxoiaa	First off, the whole point of being in a relationship is because they make you feel happy. If this man isnt giving you those feelings, it is not worth your time. Also, you cannot trust him, which is a major factor in a relationship. You say his lies werent "horrible" but they must have been horrible enough to hurt you. He knew they were horrible enough by lying about them. So in a way he intentionally hurt you - multiple times.    You need to have a little more confidence and find someone who will treat you better. If your mother is sick (hopefully not seriously ill), spend time with her. Try connecting with your father. Whatever is bothering you, only you have the power to fix it or at least cope.     Good luck.|`|Wrf5orAuaa	Don't repair it, move on. Lies are no way to conduct a relationship. Going back to it will only cause you a lot more pain and sadness.  Concentrate on your family for now, then find yourself some who will treat you right.|`|VajrBj7Saa	If this is affecting your life to the point of you being depressed, I think you should just move on and find a better guy who you can trust.    But I understand that it's really hard to let go because I've gone through that too, If you really can't end things. Talk to him, find out if he's going to change and never lie to you again. If his answer is doubtful, I think it sounds obvious. But if he's genuine, you both should just move past it.     I know it's really hard to just forgive and forget, I've been there and it's one of the saddest things to go through, but if you want to move past it, just think about all the good times you guys have had and decide if it's worth being depressed over some mistake. Don't let something minor stand in the way of a good relationship, if you let that happen, you're only going to look back and realize that you wasted a lot of time being depressed rather than making things right.    PS: Will someone please help me with my recent question? I really need help.|`|cUYunFvHaa	well once a cheeter always a cheeter!!!! at least in that relationship, so if he cheeted he wont stop, he might take a break butt thats it, so dumb his ***|`|0b5OTYbeaa	Man this sounds exactly like what my girlfriend and I are going through, the only thing that we have found to work is to talk about it and find a compromise. This is really up to the 'guy' to put the effort in to win your trust back but the thing that you have to look for is that he isn't telling lies anymore, because that means he doesn't respect your wish to know. But on that same note you also have to be understanding that you don't have to know every little detail. Hopefully I helped.|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	Honey, this happens with every "True" relationship. Things go horribly wrong. Dont know why. People tend to get bored of each other, and things get out of hand. Only thing i can tell you is that you should try to forget, if you really do love him. Or, get him to explain why he lied that way, if you still feel depressed, ask him to make it up to you.|`|0fc2ad2f54c939749f02f202ed8efb98aa	People don't lie to those they care about :S    Sorry, but I'd end it.  You're clearly not happy anymore.  You're no longer thinking about him, but of all the lies he's told you. That's not a healthy relationship.  Best to find someone who would never lie to you.|`|3a0wa0Lwaa	Its at times not easy , my cure has been to move on as fast as possible, If you met and enjoyed say for example the night club scene , then go dancing ball room or old time, or a community group like Rotary, coast guard, recreational flying, But move on as fast as possible. do not hang out in the same places , ok|`|7dmmgSVfaa	see it seems from your question that you made little hurry in deciding about your love,and you failed to recognise is he just a flirt and playing with your emotions.  but no need to think what you hv done,rather you should think what you can do,go with yopur frnz and try to hang out most of day time,make new frnz and stay away from flirts .  just be happy and youn will get someone someday who will love you with all his heart.  my wishes with you.|`|zqWJWKrbaa	I was in the same situation with the guy I'm with now not too long ago. He's also my first true love. But I found out some things that were rather unpleasant. It was hard to trust him after that and it a LONG time to get back to that point. It took several months of us talking things over and me beating him up mentally. We didn't see counselors or anything, we just stayed up multiple nights until obscene hours, him talking and mostly me yelling.   If he truly loves you, he'll listen to what you have to say. My guy did, and we're still together. It was so hard in the beginning to stay sane. Try talking in a car. That's how we worked it out. We'd drive somewhere so we couldn't slam or lock doors.  I hope things work out for you and your man

OGLulBtwaa	start talking to boys! when you find someone you like then kiss him! dont rush it, but let it happen. when you dont talk to boys your preventing it from happening.|`|UETyPTAWaa	make the move first, especially since many boys now are pretty shy. i know coz i m a boy. we really want some sweet kisses but dont dare to approach the girl. also, the girl would seem far better in any aspect as compared to us. so we feel that we are inferior to them, and not dare to lead the girl. juz make the move first, u will not regret it. unless u are really unlucky on that day and everything screws up. then u would feel bad. but overall, take my advice and gif the boy some sugar, babe!|`|ZkporQ3gaa	lol.

AUargJTaaa	I think if a guy likes you, then he'll want to be just as clingy.     Otherwise, you aren't on the same level which means it will not work. You want to find someone who wants you as much as you want them. Then, you won't have to worry about things like that. Relationships should be fun and make you happy and not tired from thinking about trivial things.
bpFacWHRaa	Well he could have mixed feelings about being in the relationship and talking to someone else because of the distance or he could just  be hurt being with you knowing he'll be even more hurt without you because hes very into you and wants to be with you more than anything OR..he could just be busy working or doing a hobby.

Or it's someone pretending to be someone they are not.... or something along those lines.|`|4qL7oRrVaa	He was lying, using you, or didn't really care about you..

HuJmTs8xaa	He's sooo likes you. Guys always act so stupid around girls they like. He's showing off. This is a no-brainer.|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	He either likes you or he's just immature. As a guy, if I like someone I'd tell them. I'm not gonna beat around the bush and not be able to get my point across. The part where you said you guys played footsies, maybe that's a sign that he does like your presence, but the rest of the things he does is a bit immature. Hope this helps, good luck!|`|w4ZPcamlaa	Of course he sure acts like he does play hard to get 4 a while then wait 4 him to ask u out. You shouldn't have to ask him out he should ask u.

846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	Re-purpose something old and give it to her.  Something from your childhood, preferably, that says "I love you".  Moms always enjoy thoughtful gifts more than expensive gifts.  Get a great picture of her and you and have something done with it, or even better- if there are any pics with you her and new hubby, copy it, blow it up and make a great portrait, put it in a nice, ornate frame and write on back a sweet letter about how much you love her, support her and wish her all the happiness in the world with (name of hubby). I promise she will get all gooey and maybe even cry, in a good way.  Good Luck!

I was just looking at pictures of him when he was a baby.      I went a little crazy those first months.  I never slept.  My significant other wasn't much help.  I had no social life.

5WB2yZUFaa	sweetie, if he doesn't respect you now, i promise he never will. he sounds like a jerk. and if it hurts when he's touching you, think about how sex would be with him.... ouch. you don't want your first time to be with someone who doesn't absolutely adore you, especially since you've  waited this long. i wish i wouldn't have given it up to someone who didn't care about me, and i hope you don't. i think you should get rid of him. good luck!|`|OwfoyXpraa	hey, if you're not ready or you don't feel comfortable with it, keep telling him what you've been telling him so far; that you don't want to, that you want him to stop.    If he really cares about you hun, he'll understand.  but if he's in this relationship just for the sex, he's not worth getting upset about. :)|`|NBCPfaXaaa	Ok, well when he starts touching you, laugh and make sure he is in a positive mood so it won't hurt him as much. Just say, "Hey, that hurts!" and then say, "I think we need to talk." Then tell him all about how you feel, because if he does truly love you then he should understand and respect that.  Also, tell him that you're just not ready for sex. If he gets mad, then tell him that he needs to respect that if he wants to continue to be with you. NEVER let a loved one pressure you into something you don't want to do. If he continues, then break up with him.    Good luck!|`|c9z51gqlaa	im ALSO 18 and a virgin, tell him to chill out keep it simple . chill im not ready for intercourse yet if you cant respect that then i cant be with you. peace. JUST LIKE THAT. then he will be scared of losing you , if he actually likes you. and will definitely stop touching you in ways youre not ready for.     he seeems he only wants to pleasure himself by touching you and doesnt care that you are not enjoying it.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Yes, break up with him.  You haven't been dating that long and the longer you are with him the worse things are going to get.  You are right, he does not respect you.  No one should pressure you into doing anything that you are no comfortable with.  He is your boyfriend and supposed to care about you.  It seems like he just cares about himself.  When a boy /man touches you, it should be soft, caring.  It should not hurt.  If he can't understand that he is hurting you and continues to pressure you and gets frustrated, this boy has serious problems.    Get out before you are a victim of date rape.  I've seen this before and all the warning signs are there.  This boy doesn't want to take no for an answer.  Your virginity might be something he wants to take from you - something he thinks he deserves - it doesn't matter if you want to give it to him or not.    Please get away from this guy.  I have such a bad feeling that something awful is going to happen if you are alone with him again. Do not go anywhere near him if you think he has been drinking or on drugs.   This guy is trouble.|`|NENNHNVPaa	Learn this now!   No means no!  Stop means stop!    If he can not respect your wishes not to take things further, then yes, you need to break up with him.  Anyone who is pressuring you into doing anything you don't wish to do, has no respect for you as a human and isn't worth your time.|`|aHXunLb3aa	don't let him pressure you into anything.  If you don't want to then its no. he has to understand that.  maybe if he's to hard with his hands try telling him that.  If he doesn't change his way break up with him.  you need someone that will respect you more.|`|54f4721ccf359bec18327f26ddcbb78caa	It's hard for guys to understand. That's why you have to tell him why you don't wanna do it. The answer can't be, "just because." It has to be straight and clear. Maybe you're not in the mood? If he's too rough, tell him to be gentle. Maybe you don't believe sex before marriage? This needs to be discuss w/ him.  Don't let him pressure you or else you'll regret it for the rest of your life.     Your body belongs to you only.|`|6Oprylquaa	You only get one chance at your first time. It sounds so cliche' but if he is really worth anything then he will wait for you to be ready. You could tell him that he is too rough and that he might wanna try a different approach. Tell him how you feel, if it is obvious he doesn't care then it's time to move on. Best of luck.

In fact, he'll come home after say, I have met a new employees of his, or a business contact, and comment that guy said something very complimentary about me.  He's proud of the fact that after 20 plus years of marriage that still happens often.      I think most guys would be proud that their wife was found attractive by others, as long as he knows her heart is his and she behaves like a lady and it truly is about her good looks, not say, sleazy manner of dress or actions that bring on the response.|`|5jMNBO2naa	no  they can hit on her as much as they want  but it's me she goes to bed with every night  and if she leaves  then oh well  i'll find another one  there are plenty of them|`|AA11313204	thats dumb, be proud of her and keep her happy, she will stay with you or she wont. ugly girls cheat too. dont be afraid of being happy.|`|koXcq0l1aa	It makes me feel good to be hit on by other men because I can just give them that look of, "Get lost.

Who raised her to be so promiscuous! jeeze|`|U1LknLaWaa	WOW. She should have waited till she was 90. What a hoe bag.|`|chZFmJOPaa	85!? Jesus! haha kidding. No I first got kissed when I was 12. A **** is someone who has sex when they are 14 and preaches it on YA.|`|vaulPrAmaa	omg ditch her what a loser|`|cvh6u58Daa	Well I'm twenty and I just lost my virginity, so i'm the **** and she's  just a tease! lol.|`|qj67XVicaa	your best friend is 85? wow that is impressive...|`|AA11043457	Are you hung up on ****?  No one is a **** for having a kiss, no matter when it occurs.      If your best friend waited this long, then it must have been very special or she sure didn't get around very much.  I'm surprised that she began now with a kiss after all this time.  Moe power to her.    She certainly didn't have her first kiss too early.  However, many do have kisses too early and when they are still kids themselves.  They have children when they are children.  There is much too much of a hurry to grow up.  However, that certainly can't go for an 85 year old.  Kids shouldn't even be dating until at least 15 and then more in groups.  There is too much of life to mess it up when you are young by trying to grow up too soon and having adult responsiblity when you are too young to perform the responsibilities  you have and perform them well.  I wonder sometimes wehre the parents are and what they are thinking.  This lady sure took a long time, but better a long time than to begin too young.|`|jW0Oy6Vvaa	first kiss is ageless-can have it at any age......|`|AA11266289	wow the girl thats pregneant at 14 is a whore|`|zbQzbyKAaa	85? Wowwww|`|WXCa8zQoaa	oh you know she is such a sL*UT maybe you better call he parents and tell them haha
U1LknLaWaa	As long as they all put out I say it is all good.     BTW I am pergonewt and your the mom.|`|vaulPrAmaa	sista, that's nothing compared to what i have    XD|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	Do you mean dating wise? or just as friends? Cause if you mean it as friends there's no limit as i see it. And for dating, call me old fashioned no more than one...|`|chZFmJOPaa	Haha pre-teen online relationship ftw!|`|fuia2Z6Maa	with how many did u sleep|`|NvCcdszsaa	I think only one true boyfrined is good, and if you swing that way, get a girlfriend and introduce them ;)|`|5c90f2b23c6015ec4fbb62bdcf506e9aaa	hahahahaha..................as long as you feel good and have fun..................|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	if you are talented you could handle five.  Mouth ..hand...hand..|`|sqNsOIzkaa	One is too many...
8YfYh3y0aa	Living with that guy till July, that's not too long and it seems like your bf needs a place to stay.  You've told him about your concerns, and the choice is his.  Hopefully, he's got enough character to stay out of trouble while he's there.   I think you really need to back-off a little.      And he gets mad because you are giving him the impression that you don't trust him.    You are giving me that impression too.
gRsuXxkbaa	u have the biggest  - hugest  - most lovely  - brain in the world...the one guys mostly think with ....  lol|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Well, I'm 24, but I don't really care to hear about anything relating to appearance. I'm not physically attractive, and I've come to terms with that. All I really want to know is that I'm valuable as a person and as a mate. Maybe that I'm smart, creative, loving or caring. I'd want to hear about the things that would let me know that she would stay with me and never leave me for another.    In a world that judges you based on shallow, superficial appearance, when you're kicked to the curb so many times, all you really want is to know that you mean something to someone. All you want to know is that you matter.|`|mSedRDDsaa	That there HOTT!|`|AA11266289	what sydney said
XH2o1MM6aa	.Eye contact,smiling and acknowledging your presence. Look if this guy has any interest he'll be showing you openly. Of course you must be sure he's free|`|ueIAKRb5aa	once hes right next to you, he will revolve his hand around and slap your *** once he passes    I do it, and it drives the girls bananas!
dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	That is a tough one and each person is different and wants different things from a relationship. To me a woman that has her act together has these things going for her.    - Strong sense of self  - Sticks to her beliefs  - Has a career   - Has goals and dreams for the future  - Is fiscally responsible and has not amassed irresponsible debt  - Can stand on her own but is not afraid to ask for help  - Likes men but that is not dependent on one    That is my take. Of course at one time or another most of us struggle with one or all of these things. Good luck in finding someone that appreciates you for you.|`|MLdykhQNaa	He's probably looking for someone who has their life in order, minimal drama and is working towards their goals.  I don't think he means independent or dependant really.  Apparently there's something going on in your life he can't deal with.|`|AA11789493	Yeah, it's easy to blame all of your problems on the someone else like saying 'you want a woman with her act together.' That way, you don't have to take any responsibilities for the problems.   As you say, we are who we are and if that's not good enough then let Mr. Perfect find someone who can live up to his specifications.  But guess what, it won't happen.  We are all human, with strengths and weaknesses--not perfect, but not imperfect either.  You probably are a very gentle person who goes along to get along and it still isn't good enough.  You get treated like a doormat and it's time to stand up and say I'm not taking this disrespect any more.  There is someone out there who will love you just the way you are.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	He means he doesn't know what you want out of life. He can't possibly help you get somewhere if you don't know what you want.    Pick a direction that makes you happy and pursue it, so he can assist you on the way.|`|5jMNBO2naa	it's usually means to set up you life  after all who want to be with someone  with bad credit  is going no where in life  is drama and high maintenance  is emotionally insecure  is needy and so on    in other words he wants you to grow up
jHUAfrojaa	STOP IT NOW. You are just getting yourself attached and he is just using you because his girlfriend won't give it up. Tell him you will no longer participate in this nonsense and he should be respecting you more if he is truly your friend.|`|Tq2ecVxNaa	My cousin's name is Nick. And this definitely sounds like him. Thats kinda funny. How old is everyone that your talking about..? Because that changes things.|`|sKto5Hucaa	I would leave him alone, regardless if him and his girlfriend do anything or not. Its disrespectful on both parts.|`|AA11520256	Are you kidding me holy god you have to say somethin that is messed up!! Why would you even do that knowing he has a girlfriend??!!! :-/
lRemKlvOaa	did you actually do anything or do you think they know something about you? maybe the one guy didnt look likes you and his friends know and want to check you out for themselves. if they keep staring at you ask them if they want something or atleast look at them and smile|`|aXOyK3uBaa	Your mistake is thinking you are REQUIRED to respond.    They're just smiling at you.    You should probably ask yourself:    WHY A KNOWING SMILE BOTHERS YOU.....   to the point where you feel "tense" and "put on the spot".    Would you prefer men looked at you with an "angry" face???  Or not pay any attention to you AT ALL.    Think about it.|`|AA11266289	tell them their weird as ****, cause thats retarded to walk past a girl and say "i know something about you"|`|5nQjGlkVaa	Just be like "BOO"....|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	You need to have more confidence in yourself.  A group of guys look and you and pay attention and smile when you walk past?  Well, honey, just looking at you must give them something to smile about! Think of it that way    Don't try to overanalyse a guy smiling at you. If he wants something more, no doubt he'll come and ask for it. They are pretty simple, you know    xx|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	ask them why do they keep staring at you...?|`|12MNsMQFaa	If you know that guy likes you then I would just smile back until he makes his move. Otherwise I wouldn't overthink it because it might get you upset when you find out that the guy doesn't actually like you.
f03976a153802da6a244397db068fdeaaa	the best possible way is to befriend someone.. then you'll find it better there..    or pick up your favorite subject for a while and concentrate on it.. will make you feel better awhile...|`|uW4npxzFaa	To make friends you need to find people with common interests. So what are you interested in?   P.S I always found that if you brought candy or whatever and you offered it to people in class or whatever (especially if its there fav) you'll have friends for life................well at least until the end of class.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	The first thing you have to do, is get to know your way around.  Get a map of the high school and highlight the rooms where your classes are. Not finding your class, with all these new people all around you, can be frightening and frustrating.  Getting to class late can draw unwanted attention to you.      Try to concentrate on the class and what you are studying.  I like to sit in the back because I can observe the people in the class.  Watch and see if there is someone that laughs at the same things you do.  Maybe this is someone you want to get to know better.      Ok, so you suck at sports.  Why can't you join any clubs?  There must be something that you are interested in.  Good luck.|`|ftZzvkNCaa	join a club and get to know people or play sports  thgen you wont feel so alone|`|q7I1Ek3kaa	If you sit next to a girl who seems nice, talk to her and make friendly conversation during the free time in class. Maybe eventually ask to eat lunch together. As for being lost around the high school...for everyone elses second day they r still getting lost around too im sure ..if you want to stop that in its tracks early then arrive to school a little earlier and find your classes before they all start!    Things will get better! Remember, you've only just began!!!!!!!|`|vQ6zwJqZaa	aawwww shame! I know exactly how you feel! I started my first day at a new High School today and needed to de-stress myself on Y/A so here i am. I'm in year 12 now (if you're in the U.S i think it's 12th grade) and i feel like a right loner. I'm academically a year advanced so i'm 15 and in a class of 16/17 year olds who are all about make up, sex and boys. I'm the only new kid in my class everyone else knows each other from the previous years and i (embarrisingly) keep on having to ask the teachers for directions. :( At lunch i wonder aimlessly around thinking i need to go somewhere, I can't find any info displayed on soprts clubs (any clubs) and I can't even make out the timetable because it's always changing for the planned week ahead.      BUT remember that it will get better! You just need time to settle down in a different environment, but different doesn't have to be bad! Cry. Cry silently in your room, into your pillow before you go to sleep if it helps and let the emotions out. You should feel more refreshed by the next school day. Take it head on! See it as a challenge that you want to take on in your stride. BE CONFIDENT! Even if you're acting it (which is what i'm doing) coz no one will talk to someone on their own, not saying anything and with their face to the wall. And look out for other new kids who are probably feeling the same as you and talk. Finally, contact me to say how things are going ok?!  Hope this is of some help!  SMILE  :)
x7vux4Veaa	A guy told me how he felt after I started dating somebody else, and it just made a huge awkward mess because i didnt want to flake on the guy I was dating. I would just keep it down and wait it out, you dont want to be the bad girl and you def will be in this situation! If they're gonna work out, then they're gonna work out and it wont help you any, but they may break up too, you just dont know. I say let yourself move on, because you deserve someone who is not already in a relationship and maybe by the time youve moved on he'll surface single again!|`|gRsuXxkbaa	dont tell him so his life wont be complicated and so u 2 wont be awkward
chZFmJOPaa	I wish I knew, cause I have the same issue it seems like.
q5cZ2UbVaa	i dont think you were being pushy at all... i have a couple of guys that say that sorta thing to me my response is always(or usually) really what are you thinking about them??? or well is there a certain reason that your thinking about this person if he didn tex back it probably was because he didn get your tex...if you ever think that maybe you should resend it one more time and see if he says anything!!!  if not he is jus being a normal guy and ignoring it or found something else to do or think about guys are jus like that sometimes|`|tAlJxSnNaa	Talk to him...|`|pPOiqaHBaa	here's a thought Fricken call him!|`|ZlC654Dkaa	Finally a female finds out what it's like.|`|AA11313204	move on  he is playing games with you|`|AA11520256	He's playin hard to get I've done it many a times|`|x7vux4Veaa	He might just be embarrassed. Stop talking to him until he talks to you again, and if he actually likes you, he'll bring it up again on his own. I just wouldnt mention it.|`|ohwWCcNHaa	Relax... obviously you were the girl that he is thinking about and he isn't quite ready to let you know how he feels. Just be patient and wait for him to text back before you send another text. patience is the strongest virtue.
mHZvOhsDaa	weekends?     ur both in the same city.. and whatnot right? so weekends you get it off? im in america so i dont know how it works in aussie land but yeah..    you know theirs myspace for mail.. and the phone.. and stuff.|`|lVNYRSs8aa	talk to her a lot online using AIM or whatever Australia has    just continue to keep the convos going until you see each other again|`|O1WxKk7uaa	ask her out on dates or just to hang out when both of you are free.. call her etc
lpgEJzS6aa	i think you would have to give it a bit more time. sometimes when someones gone you get use to them not being around, and you like it like that.   maybe talk to him, he is your dad so he should understand. just sit him down and talk to him.|`|aGno0HAwaa	Yes you are wrong. Why do you want someone who cares about you to leave you? That's idiotic.|`|ROVhLgH7aa	Dude, he was in IRAQ and I am not sure what planet you live on BUT thats  THEE WAR zone. You should even be thanking God that he didnt come back crazy, ready to kill your *** and the rest of family. So what he has changed, has he ever abused you verbally, physically or mentally? Has ever called you stupid for the longest time? I mean think about it before you wish for something bad because once it happens, it is too late to take it back, its like breaking an egg and expecting to put it back together!|`|HBM1qu0Saa	Your dad has been through an experience that all of us hope you will never have to endure.   Some of his actions could be because he had to learn a different way to act in order to survive    It is hard to "make space" for someone who wasn't there for awhile, but, right now, he needs his family, your understanding and yes, gratitude for what he did for your family.    You, yourself, will grow by exercising the attribute of graciousness. You can choose to be gracious and welcoming to him, or you can choose to be irritated.     Feeling irritated interrupts your peace, perhaps even your sleep.   Being gracious makes your heart swell, and gives you a feeling of togetherness.  You have a choice, which one will you choose?|`|WXCa8zQoaa	no because you have gotten used to a certain way of life and now he is part of the family again so you'll just have to readjust even with the cussing thing
f03976a153802da6a244397db068fdeaaa	when i can't forget someone or something, i meditate, do yoga(really helps!)    then listen to music...    do something that you like or talk to someone for hours.. will make you stop thinking about her for a while..    and final and best option is to replace her with someone else....     good luck :)|`|m7lHSV7waa	I had this same problem with a guy and it hurt a lot, but over time I kept thinking about it and I knew it wouldn't have worked anyway and so when I was around him I tried to not focus on him and instead talk to other people that were in our group.  I also found that it helps to make yourself think of other things when you're around them, like daydream.    Hope this helps.|`|t5lwrC9Caa	move away|`|Zg1ih6gcaa	I've experienced the same with a coworker.  The only consolation I've found is in reminding myself he does not feel the same.  If I let on how I feel at all, it would only turn him away more.  It is heart wrenching, especially when he brings his new girlfriend (ditz) around.  I wish I could say it gets better with time but it doesn't.  Just put on a good face when you're around her and try to get invovled in some new activities.  You'll still see her obviously but if you're busy with other things too it wont bother you quite as much.
vI3Ihd6gaa	I would focus on finding a job 1st, you need to support your son and yourself and the job will distract you from thinking about losses all day. After you find some security things should become easier and little less stressful.|`|JWZEuuhTaa	I am so sorry. Go out and have fun with your son, & be thankful for him. I know from my mom. That when ever you need him he will always be their. Like I am with my mom see my dad was a drug attic and my dad went to prison when my little sister was just a couple of months old. so my mom got left with 3 kid no husband & living at my my grandma's house. My mom and I cheered each other up & made each other stronger. I also think you need to go and make friends.So your mind is off your sadness and trying to go back into the light.|`|kwYbe4n6aa	Get any job, keep urself busy helps|`|chZFmJOPaa	I'm really sorry hun... that's terrible...  Its hard to get back on your feet, even after a break up, but you're mom being gone and all too... its hard.    Its just going to take time. Maybe it would help looking for another guy? I wouldnt have your hopes up too high bout that because if you dont meet anyone, you'll end up like me...depressed and a loser haha.    I'm truly sorry though....|`|xYAx0q4Paa	I'm so sorry about your mom :(...You have my prayer    Be Strong!|`|q6NGnYjJaa	First off i am truly sorry for your lost. You are really in a delicate situation. Well i would suggest that you need to develop your social life. Its not healthy to sit around with no friends. You may want to keep busy. Go out enjoy life, raise your beautiful child the best way you can. The main thing is to fix your social life.|`|7gMtph8vaa	Go to Church or a support group. I'm sure you'll find someone. :)|`|EIr9e67eaa	Just think of all the happy things.. you have a healthy 9 month old kid.    That should make up for what you lost.    Just take a deep breath.. tomorrows a new day|`|RpgoBWZ2aa	I'm sure it's very hard, but get out and have fun with your son. Take him to a park, or anywhere...you'll meet other mothers, and you will find friends in unlikely places.|`|ALyq4Xwzaa	Uh, try to focus on things like your 9 month old son. One look at his face should do it. You have to realize you affect him, if you show this behavior around him. The world is cruel, and only things that give us reason to live help us get through the day.|`|j0Qd9Iayaa	Try to find a daddy for your son, then maybe you two wouldn't be so lonely. Maybe get apart time job, use that money to get a babysitter and then go out to find a better job. I'm sure you'll be okay! ;-)|`|aycP5Krtaa	well you've come to the right place because were all going to try and help you. I'm sincerely sorry for the loss of your mother and your boyfriend doesn't seem fitting to leave you in your time of need. Your broken heart can only really be mended with happy thoughts of your mother and time to settle your emotions. (time is not what you want to hear but really its the only answer)|`|9DQDFiLuaa	i am sorry to hear this i know it is hard to lose some one and breaking up came in a verry bad time but what i think you what you have to do is bring your self together consentrate on somthing try stoping your heart for a while heart every one think with his heart and with his mind but the heart can give you pain sometimes but your mind never will give so try to think with your mind now for the sake of your baby make a list plan list first thing you should put in your list is finding a job second your world is open now close it build your life around your baby he is the only one how will not let you down and you dont need letting down now live for him and your self and believ me about the heart thing dont listen to it now concentrate your baby need you
52otNiElaa	Why are you going to do such a horrible thing like that to your old man. There are things he'd rather not know, tell them ur going to a friends house.|`|V4VGFyxlaa	Do you still live at home with your parents? If so than it's a hard one. You live under their roof so you live by their rules. Sounds messed up I know but we've all heard it. How long have you been with your boyfriend? It also depends on your relationship with your parents. To be honest...when I was 18 I would've not told my mother (especially my Dad) I was going to a hotel with my boyfriend. But that's good you want to be honest!|`|op4gBJRJaa	Don't tell her your going to a hotel with your boyfriend, tell her your gonna go stay the weekend at your friends because your having a girls night or something|`|jHUAfrojaa	Honestly, you shouldn't have to ask. You're eighteen, you are legally an adult. Inform her that you are going to be spending time with your boyfriend, also, it depends how long you two have been together. If it has been for a while, I'm talking about a year or more, then just flat out say it. If shorter, I don't know...    When my Marine came home for Christmas, I told my parents we were getting a room, they didn't say anything because I'm eighteen now. I pay my bills, I support myself. So they let me do my own things.|`|xYAx0q4Paa	Be Honest, and tell them how you feel about this guy!, AND BE BRAVE!!...THERES NO SCOND CHANCE!!...YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM! TELL THEM HOW YA FEEL ABOUT THE GUY!..AND TELL THEM YOUR SPENDING A WEEKEND AT THE HOTEL WITH  GUY!!.. BE BRAVE!!|`|XnaSrzUoaa	That's just a difficult question all together to ask a parent. It's good that you are being honest with your parents instead of going behind their backs. They should feel good about that at least. Honestly, I never asked my parents about staying with a chick. Most of the time they knew what I was doing anyway. Some things parents don't know, won't hurt them. Good luck.|`|AA11099449	why not just say you are staying with a g/f. Your parents don't really need to know you are sleeping with your b/f like that.
ALyq4Xwzaa	Always depends on the type of girl your dealing with. Every girl has their way of getting treated. If she is the kind where you can say a joke like that, go ahead. If she's not, dont. Catch my drift?|`|jK9yiQq6aa	if my equipment is up to par, maybe i could do some work at your place.|`|RswPfvtEaa	haha thank you anya!  thats exactly what i was going to say.|`|b3b3121a95e04fe0e32caacaeb5dda53aa	if you get caught staring at a girl's chest, do you like it when she says something about it?|`|yBnmqLZ7aa	ask her if she likes what she sees|`|OxnyOaxGaa	Ignore it and talk about something else if you are unable to politely leave.  If you can, politely excuse yourself and leave. She will get the message that she made you uncomfortable and hopefully be cautious of it if you are ever together another time.|`|ZlC654Dkaa	I would at least smile, then continue talking as if nothing happened.  Totally cool.|`|lVNYRSs8aa	do what i do, look at them, and right when you catch them looking away, say "hi"
3NKQUIglaa	If she is getting abused, its time to call the proper authorities. Even if your friend does not want that, I'm sure she does not want to get abused more.|`|8FiJ5i81aa	wtf is dad doing. get ur parents involved or call cps on that abuse woman cuz that is abuse that is serious|`|jIYNDnW1aa	Be the one to ask if your buddy can play! i mean what can you lose? Yea she could get mad and yell but she can't beat you, right? Make her mom dinner one night, give her cookies, do things for the mom without letting your friend know. It might change the way she feels about herself. your friends mom may also be stressed with life, if she has younger siblings offer to babysit! Also talk to your friend and tell her to sacrifice some of her free time and do extra chores and get dinner ready and set the table! It will show her mom she cares and like i said it might change her mind on how she feels about treating her! Also tell your friend to NEVER TALK BACK!!!! (that will blow her moms gasket!) Im only thirteen and i believe i could stand up to her mom, after all your friend will thank you!!! =D|`|u4rHgRWdaa	Firstly, WTF? If you EVER heard anything like that, no matter how much this friend of yours may love her mum, if that mother even lays a hand on her to hurt her and abuse her, call police. Duhh.....Its kind of obvious. Get a councillor, tell a teacher, another adult, this is just silly. If this is all true, head to the police station now.

Hope i helped!  xoxoxo  jackie|`|1UWicXxdaa	First off you should comfort her and tell her that your here fo her.  second i don't know but maybe talk to her about talking to someone, like a person who can help the family, and see were it goes from there. Tell her that everything will get better, and that she pretty and nice and smart. Make her feel special, and NOT worthless.  Maybe talk to your family about it and see if you can get any ideas or if they can help in any way. And if this gets out of hand which it is already, I say cops.

f03976a153802da6a244397db068fdeaaa	sorry.. i never faced this.. and don't want to...    best solution can be find someone of your own nationality over there who also lives in Canada like you.. through him make such more friends.. you won't feel so bad...    then get a person or two (canadians) who share the same interest as you... be with them...    whenever you feel like they are all staring at you, think of some funny incident you know of and just smile or laugh...    then when you feel they are dumb, good thing, it means you're smart... and when you fell the other way round then just say and do what you want to... this will make them like you, and you'll make more friends..    good luck..:)|`|bEbkV69naa	C'mon---are you really facing reality? Are you really trying. It doesn't sound like you want to make the best of things, that you feel sorry for yourself. 2 years is a long time not to make any friends. How can you when all you seem to do is find fault with them? When you go to a foreign country or new place, sometimes you have to do the changing. Ever heard, 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do?' I went to Germany for 5 years. I didn't speak German, but I tried and learned a little bit, and when I tried to speak German, they would try to speak more English. I knew other people kind of like you that just felt unhappy there and never tried to learn any customs or culture and just wished they were back in America. I suggest you give it more effort. Meet a few people and try to make the best of it and stop looking for so much to complain about. Things may get better before you think. Best wishes.|`|q0QYDtH7aa	something new isn't always easy to adapt to. It may seem best to turn around and go back but it would be a greater challenge and boost for you to overcome this and try and enjoy it. Most of those thoughts you have are just you thinking them, we perceive much more around us than what is actually occuring.|`|8Xr8ynhnaa	Pray my love. Your Angels will find a way to make it better. I'm not religious, but prayers give me strength. I feel like someone is listening who really cares and I always feel better after. And I sleep very well when I pray before bed. God bless you and I send a prayer out to you.|`|XZX9aQVOaa	You need to talk to the people and don't be afraid of that,because I believe that don't be afraid if you don't do bad things.So be friend because whatever happens "Life goes on"|`|7Ez5gFcOaa	Read the book "First Impressions: What you don't know how others see you", if you can find. or order it from Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/First-Impressions-...   Or take a look at the tables from this site firstimpressionsconsulting.com to evaluate your first impression style.
8YfYh3y0aa	That sounds very sweet to me.... don't listen to your friends on this one.   Try to find a situation where you can talk to him one-on-one.  Don't try to talk about important things, just make small talk until you two get to know one another better.   Take small steps, eventually you will become friends and maybe more.       Tell him that Auntie Nikki said hi.

She doesn't want you that way.     Even if you "made" someone fall in love with you, it wouldn't be real love, they have to love you for you. And obviously she doesn't sweetie.    You probably are a great person, and there will be plenty of other girls out there that WILL realize it and love you for YOU.

HqkZA842aa	IT CAN MEAN SEVERAL THINGS ACTUALLY. I AM TELLING YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. IT CAN MEAN THAT THE PERSON MISSES YOU AND WANTS TO BE WITH YOU...OR IT CAN MEAN THAT THE PERSON IS JEALOUS BECAUSE THEY ARE TERRITORIAL. THEY DONT WANT TO IMAGINE YOU WITH ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE IN THEIR MIND YOU BELONG TO THEM. MY EX AND I DECIDED TO STAY FRIENDS AND WHEN HE NOTICED I HAD SOME GUY ON MYSPACE ON MY TOPS (YEAH ITS FUNNY) HE CALLED ME AND ASKED ME WHO HE WAS.. AND I TOLD HIM HE WAS MY NEW BOYFRIEND. THEN HE WENT INTO HIS PROFILE AND STARTED TELLING ME "NO IM BETTER LOOKING, NO ONE WILL GIVE IT TO YOU LIKE I DID, DONT BELIEVE HIM HE IS PROBABLY SWEET TALKING TO YOU, ETC" I TOLD HIM THAT HE IS MY FRIEND BECAUSE HE FAILED ME AS A BOYFRIEND. THAT I APPRECIATE HIS CONCERN, BUT THAT IT DIDNT SEEM FROM A FRIENDS POINT OF VIEW. THE ONLY THING I DO RECOMMEND IS IF YOU BELIEVE HE IS JEALOUS BECAUSE HE WANTS YOU BACK DONT TRY TO DO IT ON PURPOSE. ALSO, IF IT TOOK HIM THIS LONG TO REALIZE WHAT HE HAD WAS GOOD THAN ITS NOT WORTH IT.|`|3jWaexYOaa	who knows mine guys are like that maybe they think that mentally yur still u still belong to themm (which is a no-no)|`|AA11313204	STAY IN SCHOOL.|`|chZFmJOPaa	Ohhh man............... worry about school.|`|qeUoAW6naa	Yes it may mean that the person is still interested in you and wants you in his life. However, if his jealousy is causing you mental anxiety or giving you pain, then it's bad!
IPS3hWweaa	This guy was just playin with you. He really finds you attractive but he had no intention of starting any kind of real relationship with you. He just wanted to see if he had the courage to get you to sleep with him, it was such a huge thrill for him to see you every once in a while but he was never serious. Just forget the guy and find someone who is genuine.    You didn't miss out on anything with that guy, except maybe drama. I'm sure he'll be around again at some point, a guy like that won't stay married for long. Keep clear of him and don't even show interest in that fool.    If you really would like to start dating, how about meeting someone through a dating site like eHarmony? I've never used it but maybe it works. Wouldn't hurt to try!    Good luck darlin, I hope you find happiness!|`|R0ZWMW5laa	I know how you feel exactly, but to the extent of how long this "affair" went on for. I get the shyness, and how he actually tried to pursue you in an unspoken way, yet still more than others. In the end, I don't think you've missed out. His past sounds a little sketchy, not to be so judge mental, but now he's with some other girl, engaged or married, you might be thankful when he possibly divorces this girl to. Not to be so harsh on him. But I think above all you want the idea of him, especially being that so much time passed Between you guys, and you never really knew him. Speaking for myself as well, I think we want that great guy to come along, when one does show us the right attention we let shyness overshadow then regret being so shy. I don't think you missed out, there will be many guys that come along, in the meantime find ways to challenge your shyness, and change your actions when a guy does try to pursue you.     :)|`|2fajO1AKaa	umm...im not sure what your question was but, "if i may"..."because i will" lol...sweetie you really need to kick your "shyness"  i know your story all too well, im as A-Social as it gets, a total introvert and it just snowballs and snowballs until it becomes this gigantic mountain of Fear & confusion  but its a paper tiger, a bag full of air--i really cant "judge" this guy, but really since you're looking for a "someone", a boyfriend etc...  you'll need to focus on more than one person and actually make it clear thats how you'd like to persue it...  glances, glares & smiles will come by the hundreds a week but if its not real "contact"-not much will come from it|`|9inngmg7aa	I think you probably didn't miss anything but what makes you feel crushed is the prospect of not knowing what would have happened had you guys made a go at it. On the other hand you should not feel bad or crushed but take it as a lesson that the next time something potentially good comes along - grab the opportunity with both hands.     kick the shyness to the curb and never let it get in the way of good things that might happen to you. i feel your pain but we have all loved and lost so just move on and live your life.    do not blame yourself for this and neither should you blame him. just accept it and come to terms with it as something that could have been but never was and let go . period!
Qu7GIg6Haa	Personally I hope the doctor that gave her the fertility meds will be prosecuted. What doc in their right mind would do in vitro on a young woman who already had 6 kids and lives with her Mama!?!? I am assuming she has no husband. If you can't afford them without government assistance (unless it is temporary and due to unforeseen circumstances) do NOT breed!!!!!  I am thinking she may have a mental disorder, so she may in fact be mentally disabled. However, I am of the mindset that if you can't afford kids, then you should not have them. I am 53, voluntarily childless, because I did not want to repeat the patterns of my family history, where men came and went and women were left holding the bag. I might have had them had I not been programmed early on that men walk away, and women raise the kids in a collective effort (moms, grandmoms, aunts, etc.).|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	She certainly should not be, that would be unjust enrichment.|`|AA11796667	I don't know but I think the woman is deranged and addicted to pregnancies, they should take all of her children away her acts are crazy and very very selfish, and the doctors who did this they are addicted to the media and need recognition and popularity this has nothing to do with the babies this is all about publicity.. Shame on all of them..|`|4qL7oRrVaa	No, if she has any sort of money to live off of, she is not eligible.

If she is on welfare now then they would take it off of her if she gets that much money.

Tq2ecVxNaa	I'm in the same situation. This guy used to like one of my friends and I've seen him before but never talked to him in person. Now we text and talk all the time but I would feel like I look desperate if I go out with him. But I've decided I don't care what people think and I'm just going to do what makes me happy. :)  Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|x7vux4Veaa	Just go with the flow. If you meet someone else then you meet someone else, but your feelings for this guy might grow! You never know! I dont think you need to be exclusive with this guy, but he has a right to know if you're seeing other people. Maybe just ask him where hes at, if he would date right now if he met somebody else.|`|oPEzV2EGaa	first of all you should weigh the pros and cons about this relationship. for example: IS HE the real thing? if another guy came up and asked you out on a date would you say yes or no? if yes than obviously something deep down thinks there is something else out there for you. it don'tt make you desperate its just you think or may have found that someone. theresnothingn like eye to eye contact so you should wait it out and see what the future holds. i always say things happen for a reason and there are no accidents in life.
6b8cbbdcbfb34ad6e49d598a03f113a0aa	First of all, try to understand what is the first thing that got into your mind when you saw a person. If the first thought is physical, then it probably is not love. But if you are excited and overwhelmed by a desire to get to know the person better and take things slowly so they work out for you, then it might be a good sign for a deeper relationship.     However,love is blind and Falling in love with someone means wanting to know everything about that person, from their likes and dislikes,behaviourial pattern, moods, habits good and bad.Now ask urself do u know everything ??     You must understand that this kind of things do happen, but not as often as they would like them to. And if out of nowhere you just suddenly start feeling the growing wings behind your back, still try to keep your feet on the ground because if he ruly loves u and has true feeling, nothing will ever happen to it, but when things go bad then disappointment from falling back on the ground can be very, very painful. Remember u are still young and do not understand how cruel life can be when u find out that the boy u loved was only wanting to use u and it was not true love. That is the the time when u are backed by ur family.

KblMZiHpaa	i actually understand what you're feeling because i just kind of went through a similar situation. idk if this is how you feel but i felt like the wind had been knocked out of me and my stomach dropped. it was a nasty feeling because i felt really hollow on the inside like i was watching my worst nightmare play out, even though it sounds more dramatic than it actually is.    i bet you're thinking something along the lines of "wtf you didn't like him before and now all of a sudden you guys are friends by association..." and feels like shes kind of stealing your life...    don't say anything to her about it because she'll feel like she has the upper hand and maybe she just likes the attention. the only reason i'm saying this is because you sound like you really mistrust her, and if you have that kind of feeling its definitely for a reason... self preservation. don't act differently with her but don't tell her anything important just make your life sound like its boring, let her think she's the center of attention. also make sure you keep yourself busy and this reallly will all go away.    and if you and the guy are still on good terms just be casual with him. don't bring up your friend to him at all. because you can get through this and it will be ok :)    i always reallly reallly hate when someone knows me really well and then all of a sudden starts acting wierd and out of character. it drives me INSANE. and i understand that you're not jealous but i feel like she's acting this way because she likes the attention....    i hope something i said helps & goodluck :)|`|j0Qd9Iayaa	I would feel betrayed too and i don't really know why.|`|8FiJ5i81aa	tell her what u just told us. how u feel. if she a tru friend she will listen.|`|t5lwrC9Caa	you can trust me|`|AA11784548	just dont talk to her and if it comes down to it pop her in mouth a few times she'll get the picture|`|6Oprylquaa	Before you get mad at her you should make sure you explained your feelings.

aGno0HAwaa	Don't degrade yourself like that because liking a guy does not has to do anything with being a ***** or ****. Take care.
3NKQUIglaa	Just let him know how you feel. You should be able to tell how he feels by his reaction. Do it in person if possible, but don't try to put him on the spot.
KPXwwwMMaa	you have options here. You can:    1) realize that your best friend means a lot to you, and that you would never sacrifice that by coming between him and his girl. Shut your mouth about your feelings, and hope that your friend breaks up with her soon.    2) Be upfront, open and honest to her and your best friend. Tell them both that you like her, and insist that she should be YOUR girlfriend. It sounds like you've already rationalized in your mind that he's interested in another girl, anyway. It will end the friendship with your best friend, but you have a good chance of walking away with a keen new girlfriend!     Years later you can think about that best friend that you stabbed in the back, and how he never talked to you again... all because you wanted a girl who you ended up only dating for a week.|`|aHXunLb3aa	Honestly don't be the one to get in between.  wait it out then go for it.  you don't want to risk losing a friend all because you couldn't wait.

People who are unhappy with their outies can have plastic surgery but it is easier to just accept your uniqueness. If you have an outie, flaunt it - it makes you special.  Make up odds facts about outies.

Not every naked woman turns every man on. That's why well-chosen lingerie is actually SEXIER (and more of a turn-on) than being naked.    .... just like YOU would rather see a "sexy" guy on the street in jeans and a black t-shirt -->> instead of seeing him walking around naked.|`|iol2xcBfaa	I would feel like there is something wrong with me.

But he is relunctant because I told him my biggest fear that was a reality and so he doesn't want to do anything I wouldn't approve of.    I would end up talking to him because either he doesn't find me attractive sexually which is a BIG problem, or he is not ready for something like that now, even if its happened before.|`|ysJA71Bpaa	I would die    ask him what's wrong. Duh!     if i were you i would have probably gone mad.
p7xOo5Hyaa	Ignore that first nasty comment.  Obviously some strange religious person trying to force their beliefs on to someone else.  It may be that he is just tired, or he could be very self concious.  Hey may feel threatened about how open you are about sex and so he gets shy.  He may even feel that (no offence) you always come on to him, rather than give him the oppurtunity to come on to you maybe? Test the water, from now on, don't be open about sex and dont come on to him or pay him any sexual attention and see what happens.  I'm sure he will realise what he is missing.  If not, maybe you should talk to him, tell him you feel that he doesnt show any interest in you sexually, and see what he says.    Goodluck :)|`|BBlfetz3aa	it could be two things. one it may be that he may not find your body as attractive as before or two he's just not that into you. or possibly both. sorry to be the bearer of bad news. keep your head up though he is probably a douche anyway|`|q5cZ2UbVaa	maybe you should just keep your clothes on and wait for him to ask or signal for you to take them off i myself have never had this happen to me and i dont think your obsessed over sex...i would think your just horny lol or would like to please your man ignore the comments about you being obsessed girl!!!  jus wait for him to give you a sign that he wants you to take it off or maybe even ask him wats wrong!!!  hope this helped girl!!!! best of luck|`|p5TnVlWpaa	i guess id probablly feel as bad as your feeling right now! its a major blow on self confidence, and i think the best thing to do is ask him what the problem is.     try watching a movie with a great sex scene in it, you never know he might get a bit excited and want to reinact it!!! :):)|`|0ec82562a26aa12a1149c87e311c0d12aa	as a guy i recommend keeping your clothes on until he seduces you to take them off.  as a guy i like the girl to be the vulnerable one and for me to take her.  i like to feel like it's my decision and that she isn't trying to force me.  if she is walking around naked i might think she was trying to manipulate me into having sex with her and it might be a mental block because i might feel that she was trying to control me.  i like things to be much more subtle than that.|`|Tq2ecVxNaa	The sounds like that Sex in the City episode. You know the one with Charlotte and her husbandd.... Anyways. I would do what she did.   She was like naked and then kinda went off on him asking why he wouldn't have sex with her. Lol|`|HVIccDqlaa	iT S0UNDS LiK 2 ME HE'S CHEATiNG 0R GAY. 0R MAYB B0TH.

Does he not find you  exciting anymore? or has the  flame between the two of you  gone out? Try another approach  go out with your girlfriends...  have fun and leave him alone  for a while then maybe when  you return he'll be the one wanting  it you never know! ~Good Luck|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	Maybe hes GAY, some men wont tell you that they are GAY even if your in a serious relationship. men are good at hiding there thoughts, that's why they are so angry because they wont talk about their feelings or cry about it. There is nothing wrong with a man CRYING, at least I know he has feelings and hes not such an angry guy.|`|aGno0HAwaa	I am not a slot and so will I never be one. If I did no guys would like me and they will be disguised my character. By the way it is usually guys obsessed with sex, but in this case it is you! What a shame.|`|UmxxBr6uaa	I would feel pretty crappy. But maybe you should stop obbessing over sex. Start being more modest and see what happens. Let him come to you next time.
y4SUDnpaaa	You said you were on and off for a year so it was never a stable relationship. Who knows why anyone does anything and what does it matter, the results are what matters. She probably met a guy she thinks will solve her self esteem problems. If that's the case,  she obviously doesn't realize only she can solve self esteem problems and is in for a big surprise. Chances are she will eventually want to come back to you. It will be your decision on whether you want to keep this drama in your life or better yet make your decision right now.|`|jswDLpJzaa	it sounds like shes using you. for emotional, financial, & other reasons. you need to lose her, for you own good.|`|elhcuN19aa	She is playing you man  cut your losses now......  She is wasting your time    and her lack of self esteem does not help the cause|`|HhSUyOs1aa	Sometimes people react in a very mysterious ways, without any clue of what happened.     Sometimes in this care your girl acts very selfish, she hooks you up. making sure you are not going anywhere, and will be there for her, at the same time she goes out and finds another one. She will for sure come back to you, when she need to treat her low selfesteem.    Sorry to say but she is taking advantage of you, and you let her do it. By shoeing her you are there for her, nomatter what.     You have to put your self in focus, and control what you want. Push her away, because I think she will come back.     I sounds tuff but I think you should go out flirt and date other girls. and then see what the future brings.    Read this acticle     http://girlfriendback.blogspot.com/2009/...    I think it will help you, because you are way to nice of a guy for her.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	some married men will try to hit on any girl to see if they can. maybe they like what they see, and just want to see how far they can get.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	You probably are pretty. You're also probably nice, patient, caring, innocent and a good listener.    How are you surprised?|`|5jMNBO2naa	what are you wearing at work?  and a you very attractive?|`|Ipnnj07uaa	and i am supposing u are not married..........well married men in my experience are coming at everybody......ususaly they are frustrated in their marriages and look for comfort outside. i dont think its u.|`|VBdXray0aa	That is the way they are.  Now you know why women do not want to marry anymore.   When their 'loved one' cheats, they can just walk with no repercussions.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	For many men, not all, the chase is the turn-on, and in marriage, they see the chase as over. But they still want to chase, it's built into the DNA. Ignore their hints, flirtations, etc. Act like you do not have a clue they are coming n to you. If they are persistent, sneak an anonymous message to their wives.  It is NOT about how you look or how you dress. A dog will sniff ANY available skirt. Cute girls, ugly girls, fat or skinny. They probably come one to every woman they see, just waiting for one of them to take the bait or to be gullible to fall for all that crap about "My wife does not understand me, she's lazy, we have no sex life, I'm only there for the kids, etc." Generally it's all lies anyway.   There are skanky folks everywhere, male AND female. IGNORE them. If it rises to the level of harassment, tell a supervisor.|`|AMDoV0ecaa	Dont pay them any attention maybe it's something your doing are your passing signs to them.|`|elhcuN19aa	Maybe you are an attractive person  but those guys are losers who dont respect their wives|`|WvYro8nVaa	Single girls are always target of men, especially the married ones b/c it's a chance to have an affair and play with them. You'll find them everywhere, not all but many guys even when married likes to feel they still got it. just ignore them and stick hanging around single men.|`|vlhp0Cxmaa	Seriously- who knows why people do the things they do. Possibly the thrill of getting caught? The thrill of the game? People such as these obviously have issues. It does not matter how you look or what you wear to work, the problem is with them! Hopefully you do the right thing. Remember- if they are doing this to their wives, they WILL most likely do it to you. Good luck!|`|JYgMqRPgaa	casue some guys dont care an some guys see certain kind of videos  an they have this idea in there head  an maybe cause you might be sexxy|`|HqkZA842aa	Sweetie I have been in the same shoes. You feel like you have a married husband magnet. What I recommend is just know your limits. They are probably doing it because they want action on the side and want to find a gullable person. If you realize the majority of married men tell you their wife doesnt cook for them, wash their clothes, etc. If the married guy doesnt know you know he is married is because he wants to take advantage, I dont know how you may be at work, but you do have something that attracts them. Wish you the best and be careful.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	maybe he felt that things could get out of hand, and if he is a man who values his family he may not feel comfortable, maybe feels it could turn into something else that would cost him his family. i think u should cut all ties, he is married and does have a family and if he wanted to make contact he would.|`|iD4ejChZaa	who do you think you're fooling sister?|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	I think that if you are even minutely attracted to each other then you don't really need to intrude on his happiness with his wife and family.  You should leave him alone and find a single friend to be friends with.|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Back off and leave him alone.  You know full well that you are entertaining an attraction with a married man, which will, in time, become a full blown affair.    How would you like it if your husband or boyfriend was having a 'friendly attraction-type friendship' with some chick?  No?  Didn't think so.  Leave him alone
XH2o1MM6aa	.Nothing worse than an over zealous partner.Of either gender.This guy has all the hallmarks of jealousy,now.Do yourself a favor and cut him adrift.He demands too much attention and this is already infringing on your own quality time.He already wants to control you and your actions.Dump him before he makes yourlife a misery
AA11704353	I love all the dresses!!!!!!!!!!!!  but the last one is really pretty and elegant!!!!!!!  But girl where whatever you want its your day!!!!!!  Congrats....|`|HqtdnJvqaa	if you have the body for the first dress i say go for it. the dress is pretty and if your guests really care about your dress then they are there for the wrong reasons. you should be happy on your wedding day and wear whatever makes you feel like the vixen you are/ want to be.     **edit just make sure you feel comfortable showing off that much skin.|`|cd8f30c22031713366cdb6b1bfaa4f5faa	the second dress is lovely for your reception and the veil suits both dresses.|`|LK4bJr62aa	The second one... absolutely. Congrats and Good luck!|`|kHEFi3ttaa	I have to agree while the 1st dress is a very pretty dress it is a little to showy. I love the 2nd. It's similar to the first but covers you up better.    I think it's a nice compliment to your over all wedding style.    Good Luck and congratulations.|`|7a9ca1e0d676415430d900245a7c2d25aa	I like the first dress for the reception, but it does look a bit inappropriate. The second one is so pretty. I like it better for a reception.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I love the veil!|`|HEvSVMeVaa	Both reception dresses are very beautiful! But I would go with the second one. I think it will really pull your look together! Congrats!|`|846b3af290613f2b0cdb0b7edc68ce91aa	I would take a vintage dress you love and alter it to be similar to those you linked to, taking up the front hem and adding frills to skirt, but keeping the vintage neckline.  I think it will be exaclty your style, because you had a hand it creating it.  Congrats on you big day!

uttbqGB9aa	*****EDIT - To big boy up there with the HUGE penis, the penis only internally stimulates, By having the HUMONGOUS penis that you do ONLY PROVIDES  pressure pleasure.    So your 2 inch pinch be amusing your gal pal :)  &&.. a Huge penis does not compensate for ability.     Just FyI :)...The more you know *Rainbows*    ***********************      Don't feel bad honey, It took me til 23.     Some will tell you its the guy he sucks, but that is NOT true a lot of times.    Female climaxing is not like males. There is a lot of emotions involved, a majority is in your head.    Also, a lot of girls expect the guy to get her to finish, but not all girls can. (YOU & ME)    You have to find a position and an angle that works best with you.     You are not doing anything wrong sweetheart, you just havent found out what to do right...for yourself.    Figure out a postion that stimulates that special area...you know where.    You might need an angle where a part of him is rubbing against your special area.    Some girls can only climax off of direct stimulation to that area.    You will figure it out.    If he does not mind, try some toys during sex. it helps until you get it on your own :)    You will. Good luck Kitten :)|`|07YBD5mJaa	here are some great sites that may help you=]  best wishes!  http://living.health.com/2008/02/07/12-s...    http://honeymoons.about.com/gi/dynamic/o...  http://www.talksexwithsue.com/index2.htm...

If you need to, get a personal massager.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	keep practicing|`|4TNavgDuaa	Maybe he isnt lasting long enough for you.  They sell a vibrating ring you can get them anywhere that sells condoms and he puts it on and that seems to work.|`|SNaxiArHaa	He's probably not hitting your g-spot. Try and find what works for you. Maybe you need to have oral to finish. Most girls never finish with intercourse and need foreplay and clitoral stimulation.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	maybe you aren't that comfortable.|`|HSsqa0Vgaa	Maybe his penis is too small.  Maybe he is bad at working it. Luckily, I have a huge one and am good and always pleasure my gf.|`|kwYbe4n6aa	Find ur G-spot and tell ur guy to touch it more|`|gRsuXxkbaa	try more foreplay and ask him to orally stimulate u as well|`|gAuIixm6aa	well why don't you get a vibrator and figure out what you like? also you can't expect to come EVERY time... but I think once you figure out what you aren't doing right things will improve.|`|HlDORDadaa	maybe you're not really attracted to him.  call me up sometime and vote me for best answer ;)|`|QtaPF83iaa	It's perfectly normal.  your not doing anything wrong.  It'll take time and experiementing to figure out what works for you.  It's not easy for every girl to finish.  Some of them have sex for years before they can do it.  I knew a woman who didn't have her first orgasm during intercourse until she was 30.  It just takes getting to know your body.|`|cvh6u58Daa	Are you relaxed when your with him? are you two in a place where you feel completely safe and alone? If not that could be what is making you not finish, relax, enjoy what's going on, show him what you like and let him help you finish.  Intercourse doesn't always help a girl finish, sometimes you have to touch, kiss, and relax.|`|2G0a5zUSaa	RELAX, you are working to hard at this.  Just enjoy the experience and pretty soon it will happen for you.|`|cCUVwsMvaa	good luck sweetheart. you cant orgasm without clitoral stimulation and 90 percent of the time when having intercourse there is none. try going on top, thats probably the best way to finish in a matter of ten minutes. good luck.|`|HpPNg0heaa	"girls only" rofl!|`|4f3017e9314ece0d4dcec124019bf954aa	oral.  works everytime.  but he can't stop and you cant push him away.  have fun!|`|SIfrAHxraa	Maybe it's not you....it could be him.  Try a little foreplay before you start doing....."it".  Tell him to go down, and not to be licking like he's like the creme off an oreo....more like, suck a little hard on the "cli(t)" area and bite it a little.  Then tell him to "finger" you, but there is a certain way to make you scream.  When he uses maybe 1 or 2, when he gets to his second knuckle in, curve it up, and instead of going in and out, tell him to go up and down real fast.|`|MdYQlMfeaa	well theres alot of woman who can orgasm actually, its not just you.... have you tried clitoral stimulation? Or different positions? maybe even using Toys might help..|`|9WN7Yt8Qaa	many women are unable to finish with vaginal stimulation alone. Some women can only climax by clitoral stimuli. So keep practicing and you will find what makes you finish.
Ly2tIgUKaa	no idea man but ya left the t out of miltf ( its mother id like TO f*** not mother id like f***)|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Lol, if they're horny enough|`|vpeZTL9Laa	mmmmmmM.I.L.F!|`|b8LM28bVaa	They love young studs......trust me!|`|iol2xcBfaa	it totally matters how they think.  Read the signs, if she flirts with the guy and how she acts when he's there.|`|t1NTGuIZaa	you watch too much porn....
EULDW1Kwaa	There is no 100 percent way.  And lol, don't use 2 condoms.|`|N1qKXDs2aa	dont usse 2. the friction from the 2 condoms wil most likely cause one of them to break. not a smart idea.    you should wait until you get married anyway. that way you wont have to be concerned about this|`|J3iBuHAHaa	dude, first of all you need to chill. a girl can tell immediately when a guy is scared about his first time and it's a turn off..it also may lessen your performance (if you know what i mean).     secondly, using a condom is easy...just slip it on all the way..believe me, its like the easiest thing to do. lol.    I would suggest using a strong trojan kind to prevent a tear or broken condom, and if you want to be doubly carful, tell her to take a birth control pill (preferablly YAZ because it won't make her gain weight like most birth control pills will, and it will also help her when its "that time of the month"). You should also watch which days you have sex on..a girl is most firtle 14 days after her period..and there are up to 5 extremely firtle days, so you may want to keep her cycle in mind.    Also, a great sex tip: Massage the Clitoris when you are making sweet love to her...and read her body language...and avoid asking too many questions during the sex, it takes the pleasure out of it. For more tips, you can e-mail me.    Good luck, and remember to have fun and relax :)|`|cj8iM1Olaa	The only way to be 100 percent protective is not to do it at all...    But i'm not for abstinence, so condoms give you pretty good odds too.|`|6GdeuiCgaa	The only way to totally, 100% avoid pregnancy is not to have sex.|`|b5UV15gCaa	the only way is not to be 100% is not to have sex. Just wait if you are young you have a lot of years to be frisky. You don't want any babies too early.|`|9DQDFiLuaa	you cant be sure and dont wear 2 it is same as one|`|zrQVmRO3aa	100% protected = Abstinence    How old are you? Doesn't sound like old enough if you   1.) don't know how to use a condom  2.) feel ready to lay down and do an adult thing but not ready to handle the consequences of your actions. Now if you were married it would maybe be a blessing....but to me sounds like you are not ready.|`|PAY58zPNaa	just to let you know, condoms are not 100% effective and protective. it only protects 96-99% of the time.   Put the condom on when the penis is erect, before there is any contact between the penis and your partner's body. Fluid released from the penis during the early stages of an erection can contain sperm and organisms that can caused STI''s.  Open the condom package at one corner being careful not to tear the condom with your fingernails, your teeth, or through being too rough. Make sure the package and condom appear to be in good condition, and check that the expiry date has not passed.  Place the rolled condom over the tip of the hard penis, and if the condom does not have a reservoir top, pinch the tip of the condom enough to leave a half inch space to collect semen. When putting a condom on an uncircumcised penis, pull back the foreskin before rolling the condom on.   Pinch the air out of the condom tip with one hand and unroll the condom over the penis with the other hand. Roll the condom all the way down to the base of the penis, and smooth out any air bubbles, as they can cause the condom to break. If the condom comes off, withdraw the penis and put on a new condom before intercourse continues.     Soon after ejaculation, withdraw the penis while it is still erect by holding the condom firmly in place. Remove the condom only when the penis is fully withdrawn. Keep both the penis and condom clear from contact with your partner's body.   Dispose of the used condom hygienically. Wrap the condom in a tissue and place it in a bin, do not flush it down the toilet. Make sure never use a condom more than once.|`|xDTwWM5Xaa	Use a condom, have her on the pill, and have that PLAN B thingy just in case. I really don't recommend it|`|yJQpxV75aa	Anal.|`|hzBILdNvaa	There is no way to be 100% sure that she won't get pregnant except for...ABSTINENCE.  If you still plan on proceeding then use only one condom and make sure that it is a condom with spermicide.  Also use a spermicidal foam(you will find the directions on the container on how to use all of these items).    Make sure that this is the peron that you want to loose your virginity too as you can only loose it once in you entire life.    Good Luck|`|cvh6u58Daa	First off, are you really ready for sex? it's a huge step in a relationship and you have to think things through first, If you are. Then the best advice we can give you is for the both of you to use birth control, you use condoms every time, and use condoms with spermicidal lubricant just in case.    Also, it would be a good idea to go on the pill, or take the depo shot, so that she doesn't get pregnant. ask her what she wants to do, but always always use a condom.|`|8vLfJMCMaa	The fact you want to be responsible is a noble thing.     You probably will do it anyway so I don't want you leaving here uninformed with your only advice to be abstinent, which either comes from a girl or a grown up. I don't know many guys that would offer the advice to chill on losing your virginity and the pressure must be a real biatch to lose it.    I can only hope you aren't pushing some virgin girl into doing it with you to benefit your machismo contest.     Go to youtube.com and search 'how to put on a condom" and "losing your virginity". I know its sounds lame but know one has to know and obviously your lost and need help.     The problem isn't that it will break but that it will slip off.     BTW: you will always remember your first time...no matter how bad it was, and it is always bad if you are doing it just to do it!!|`|dcqJjHN6aa	if you are asking on here you are too young or not ready yet so dont|`|AA10572614	Read the condom instructions, turn 18, and make sure your serious girlfriend is on the pill.|`|fuia2Z6Maa	one is fine and remove it out as soon as u orgasm|`|AA11266289	hahahahahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahahahah...|`|AA11811299	2 condoms wouldnt help at all. theyre more likely to slip off|`|x7vux4Veaa	2 is actually worse than one because the friction can cause them to break.

You will probably feel really horrible for giving yourself to someone...I know i have regretted it,good feeling AT THE TIME or not..
nfynTFnTaa	You need to explain why you do not want to transfer. Is it a top college or university? Are you enjoying the freedom of being on our own and away from you parents? Be specific.    It does not sound as though you have made any commitments to/with her. you talk of love but are still doing your own thing. It may be nice to know that she is not doing anything while you are out on the town but it is not fair to her. Relationships require effort. It seems pretty one-sided as you describe it. Long distance relationships are tough- I know, my wife and I were apart for over a year though neither person's fault.    Do not do anything in the heat of the moment. Give it time. You both need to talk about your future goals. I think if you do the answer will become obvious.|`|nq5SlmYHaa	It's up to you but it sounds like she is missing you loads. If she is constantly trying to talk to you she may feel left out. I think that she needs to learn to be more independent, therefore i would dump her. It's not good for you to be constantly harassed by someone. Clingyness is so annoying. She is making you feel down. If you finish her you will find a much better girl nearer your college. She is being selfish and not respected your choice and that's not fair. You need to ask yourself this question: Can you see yourself having a future with her? If no then finish her it's not fair on you both to be in a relationship that is basically not going anywhere. She needs to be on her own and gain confidence. Hope I've help and good luck.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	You are young. Don't let her or anyone hassle you into moving away just for her. If you just started dating her, it's way too soon to get such an attachment. Finish school, live your life.    Tell her that you don't want to change your life so soon.|`|AA11266289	uhh your going to a nice college and are going to do something with your life and shes in community college asking you to transfer closer, dump her *** and find a smarter girl at your school unless shes reallly hot|`|VajrBj7Saa	My opinion on guys considering to end a relationship is to NEVER impulsively throw something away when you're not sure if this relationship could have a potential to be good.     If you see what her problems are, then confront her about it. Tell her you don't appreciate her doing that, tell her that you value the relationship but you won't transfer to be with her. Tell you that you are seriously having second thoughts on this relationship due to her actions. If that doesn't shut her up or make her change her clingy ways. Then maybe it is time to end things.

Does she have friends? she should go out with them, she needs to understand that you are in school, and you have work to do you have to study and work towards your degree. I wouldn't blame you for telling her your not going to transfer, good school's are hard to get into and i'm sure you worked your butt off to get where you are today.    If she can't understand that, than maybe it is best to cool off for awhile.|`|GKLIyfKQaa	You should spray feces at her when she passes by.|`|AA10572614	You need to break it off.

XH2o1MM6aa	.Buy her a nice necklace with her birth sign as a pendant
V7grzObHaa	i would probably want to introduce myself and let him know who i was.  the most important question i would want to know is if he knew that she was married?  then i would wish them well and move on.  never give anyone the upper hand or power of you by acting violent or saying crazy things.  self control is the power.  unfortunately, your ex wife neither had self control nor the power of love to remain faithful.  you really dont deserve someone like that, no matter how much you may have loved her.  she is tainted and dirty with no self respect.  God will judge her and him, especially her because she knew that she was still married to you whether legally or scripturally (i am a Christian)|`|AA11313204	i would want to punch him in the face. but it depends on the situation. did he know you? did he know she was married? what did she tell him about you? ultimately you are better off just ignoring him.|`|elhcuN19aa	I would say hi and keep it moving like nothing happened between us...  That chapter is done for good|`|ffxB7EdZaa	Not only would hitting the man be assault (and could land you in jail) it wouldn't resolve anything. It wouldn't reverse the adultery, it wouldn't fix your all ready ended marriage, and it wouldn't make you feel better if you really thought about it.    Even if you still have hard feelings towards your former spouse, it should never cause you to act out in violence.     It was your ex-wife's ultimate decision to commit the act of adultery, which in no way removes the fault from the other man, but shows how little self-control and love for you your former spouse had. You should be glad to be a free man and realize what a fool the other man was for thinking your former spouse was anything special. If anything, you should pity the man for being so blind.    The least attractive thing in the world is when someone flirts or responds positively to flirting when they are in a committed relationship. It yells out dishonesty and carelessness.    I wouldn't give the man more than a passing glance once I realized who he was and I'd move on with my life. Being angry would give my former spouse power over me that they should never have had to begin with. And being violent would either land me in jail or leave me feeling empty inside knowing that it did nothing more than inflate my ego for a moment (or possible put me, him or both of us in the hospital.)    I'm not Christian, but I believe the philosophy of non-judgment and forgiveness is a good rule to follow. Mostly because it prevents others from having power over me.|`|K6vEbdqxaa	It's not the guys fault that your ex is a sl*t!  Move on and just leave him alone.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Be the better person and ignore him.    Violence isn't the answer.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	My hubby had that with both his exes.  One of them actually married (and is still married to) the guy she cheated with.  In the early days, when I first met my hubby, I remember he felt like punching him in the face, but he restrained himself because there was his son in the picture, so he had to think of his son.    These days, we get along with them both of them fine.  There is no love lost, but he has no problems at all with it any more.  He has forgiven her for cheating on him, and now realises, since our relationship and marriage, that their relationship was not the right one for them, otherwise this wouldn't have happened in the first place.     In simple terms, he moved on and has no anger.|`|5jMNBO2naa	that happened in a restaurant  just as we ( my new Gf and my best friend and his gf ) we leaving, they were entering  it was an odd moment, we froze in our tracks  my best friend knew the back story on the guy  he was my ex's co worker  he goes up to the guy and shakes his hands, and say so you are Mike...  and then says hi to my ex  i smiled and said hi to me ex ands we left  laughing our asses off  i thanks him for breaking that odd silence|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	You can acknowledge his presence with a cold hard stare. Keep going to the gym, do not allow his presence to intimidate you.  I would not start a fight w/ him, this will lower you to his level. She is the real guilty party, he was just there when she made her decision.  Vengeance is a dish best served ice cold, and living well is the best revenge of all.|`|8Hlvv8a4aa	Thank him and wish him luck. She will do it to him as well.

Girls LOVE complements!!!!  What you should say:    Junior: Hey, I was just sitting over there and I noticed that you have a really cool shirt.    Freshman: Thanks.    Junior: Ya, no problem. You have a really cool style. Do you go to the mall a lot?        (girls love shopping)    Freshman: Yes/No/Sometimes      (whatever her answer is)    Junior: Oh, that's cool, maybe we should go together sometime and you could help me with my style.                (maybe you need help maybe you don't but girls love the idea of giving a boy a make over!)    BAM!! Instant date. Be confident.      Get her number or give yours to her, and if you see her during school smile at her when you make eye contact.|`|AA11441704	Let your friend introduce you.|`|eu9czRUSaa	ask her something|`|dZrLotpgaa	say Hi

He will probably ask whats wrong, you just respond "Nothing, just playing hard to get". If not, you can always tell him.|`|ZkR1Y2fTaa	sorry I am not a dude, but you should just tell him, pretty much all women need foreplay to be aroused it shouldn't hurt his ego its just a fact of life. just tell him,|`|7DyrzgpAaa	Just tell him that you would like it if you & him did foreplay more often as it arouses you quicker and makes it not "just sex". From Personal experience it will not hurt his ego. Make him want you more (teasing him), etc.|`|zFx7NT2Baa	Next time tell him the way it is for you, but with a smile and make a bit of a game of it, tell him, for example, "I want you to have a hug coming and want to see if we can do more playing around and if that playing around takes time, and you enjoy it (as I will) and then after you burst tell me if it was better for you".... that sort of message.    I have found taking a bath together leads to great foreplay.  Have him dry your hair afterward; he has to be naked, lights low, and you can have a little play with him as he drys your hair.  Get the picture.  You will be getting the message too and it delays getting under the covers.    Hope that helps.  Lucky guy.
08y217Rdaa	Guys don't waste time on girls they don't care about. Why on earth should you ever regret telling him? If he has all those traits you like so much, just tell him. Spontaneously.|`|HuJmTs8xaa	I really think the best thing to confront this is to write him a letter. You can explain everything and say everything you need to say without being embarrassed. But if he's not the type who is shy about face-to-face talks, then you should tell him face-to-face. With a letter, there's that chance that he'll be too embarrassed to say anything, but in person, he might say, hey, I love you too, and then kiss you or something. By the way, he totally likes you.|`|AA11376721	Trust me when I say...you HAVE to tell him. I went through something similar and I never told him. That was over 2 years ago. Now, he's engaged and getting married soon. I blew my chance. To this day, I regret so much not telling him. Don't let the same thing happen to you. If you don't tell him, you will always wonder what could have been...and trust me...that is a horrible feeling. Someway or another, you have to tell him.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	look i know what you mean because i was in love with this guy and we were friends... and i really iked him and i regret it because he moved to another state and i never told him what i felt because i was scared of being rejcted so my advice to you is: TELL HI HOW YOU FEEL!!! you never know maybe he still has feelings for you...and hell give it another try.. good luck :)|`|uNlbvD5vaa	Yes, tell him.  Don't live with regret you will kick yourself later for it.  What is the worst that can happen? He will laugh at you? You will be humiliated?  He doesn't sound like he would do that, by the way you are describing your current relationship with him.  Do not bring up past things though, when and if the time is right, you will discuss things that happened in the past relationship.|`|pJ7icz0taa	Ok you know if you tell him you love him and he doesn't feel the same way you will be hurt.  If you don't tell him you might regret it.    Tell him, it's worth the chance of getting hurt, you will at least know if he feels the same way.  Ask him to go to the park or to a special place that is quiet so you can talk. Tell him all that you feel and ask him if he wants to take another chance at it.  If he says no then at least you can move on with your life knowing you tried and gave it your all, with no guilt.  Good luck.|`|jW0Oy6Vvaa	yes you should. you should express your feeling b 4 its too late n b4 someone else take away the person from you.. best of luck.|`|lCWIYPLtaa	Of course there is no reason for you not to try again!|`|qj67XVicaa	this seems almost identical to what i'm going through with my ex. I saw go for it! He sounds into you. good luck :)
wMWfCjBpaa	I don't see why you can't. But I would still go with a cake from a bakery shop of some kind. Many grocery stores, including Wal-Mart use frozen cakes. Meaning it's sent frozen and they defrost it then use their own frosting. I used to work at Ralphs for a month in that dept. That was five years ago, so maybe things have changed.    I'm getting a cake with fondant. Only two tiers will be real and the others fake. I just want nice pictures. We'll be serving most of the guests a piece from a huge flat sheet. It's so much cheaper this way. I have 400 guests.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Walmart cakes are yummy. They're not near as dry as other grocery store bakeries. I don't personally know anyone who has gotten a wedding cake there though, but the cake itself is the same as what you get from their bakery section for any other occasion in the 8" rounds or cupcakes. You will have to go in and ask them what the price is because there is no way to predict that based on the size and what area of the country you are in.|`|oYoRlRsKaa	yes I got the most wonderful wedding cake from Wal-Mart. It was delicious,moist and exactly what we ordered. It cost us approx $1.oo a slice. that is the norm for wal-mart bakeries will charge from 1.50 to 2.oo dollars a slice. I have been to other weddings with the cake from wal-mart and have not heard any complaints|`|k6F9zkIRaa	They are good! And they look nice as well. My cousin however got hers from walmart. She got a 3 tier cake and her top layer was leaning! It was so incredibly noticeable. They called walmart, they apologized and said the person who was supposed to make the cake quit so they had to have someone else fill in and quick! They of course gave her a full refund. Unless this happens to you I don't see anything wrong with getting the cake from walmart. Good Luck!|`|AA11082914	I work at Walmart in the Deli (right next to the bakery). Their cakes are pretty good, but the only problem is that their cakes aren't really all that big. Their basic 3 tier cake runs about $120 or so, but only feeds about that many people (118, plus the top tier). Your best bet would be to get one of their cascading cakes with 5 "tiers". That might be enough to feed 250 people. MIGHT. Can check into it tomorrow and add an edit to this answer with a price for that cake, and a for sure serving amount. My only problem with walmart cakes is that the biggest round cake size they have is only 12 or 14 inch. My cake can't come from there, as my bottom is a 18, the middle a 16, and the top a 12. My smallest tier is their largest. Also, something to think about- Walmart doesn't actually bake their cakes. They come in frozen (even the sheets) and they just thaw them out and decorate them. Same thing for their cupcakes. Also, at Walmart, their wedding cakes ONLY come in white cake. Just some more stuff for you to consider first.    *ADD* OK. Just got home from work. The five "tier" cascading wedding cake is $231, and with all five tiers, it serves 215 people. You would still be getting it way cheaper than $650. I know that the 215 servings wouldn't be enough, but you could get a couple of sheet cake "grooms cakes" in addition to the wedding cake, and be able to save a "tier" for your first anniversary. Even with the sheets, you'd come out under $300.    My prices are for the 2 Walmart stores in Findlay, Ohio- might be a little higher (probably not much, though- it is walmart afterall) if you're in New York City or LA or something.|`|NglVonEUaa	I got my wedding cake from Walmart almost 5 years ago. It was a 3 tier cake and it cost me $150. It was decent. It wasn't great though. And I don't know about now, but they wouldn't do my cake in anything but white cake. So we got a chocolate sheet cake for about $40 as our "groom's cake". We had about 250 people that attended and those cakes fed them all.     Good luck! And congrats!|`|AA12360257	sams club better|`|A4G03Bzbaa	baller son!!!!!|`|sqNsOIzkaa	I know I'm no help but WAL MART SELLS WEDDING CAKES?!

Much cheaper.|`|kOlZqhSdaa	ACtually they are not bad but if you have a Costco nearby theirs are better....actually the costco wedding cake is the best wedding cake I have tasted.  It might not be the fanciest but it does the trick.  I went to a very extravagant wedding at the Legend Hall in the San Francisco Presudio. They had a cake that cost the $1500. It was Very very very beautiful but...the cake was dry and the frosting paste stuff they used was not what you would want to eat.|`|VlzlPAEwaa	At the last minute, the place my cake was coming from told me, they couldn't;t do it, The only choice I had left, was Safeway, 110 people cost me $249.00 I got so many compliments on the taste, and look, it was crazy...it was so moist, and delicious, I was stunned when my husband ans I shared our first bite together...You can do a tasting on site...you would surely not be making a mistake.|`|PqGCeIelaa	I didn't know Wal-Mart does cakes, I asked Sam's Club and they didn't.   I would try going to a local grocery store. One that does a lot of wedding cakes. I got mine from a local grocery store and it was the best cake I have ever had. I'm not just saying this b/c it's my wedding cake. I normally don't like cake.   I had it for 200 people and I payed $2.50 per person. But that's b/c I had it flavored and stuff.  If you a lot on a cake, I would ask the baker to make you a smaller version of the cake that you will be cutting and then have them make sheet cakes for you that the venue can cut for you in the back. You can save a lot of money on this. Also your 250 guests are not all going to eat your cake. You baker will tell you this and they will advise you to cut the   down to like 200 or something.   You should go to a few cake tastings. And then make a decision.|`|4SjwTCASaa	If you have a Rosauers or an Albertson's their cakes are delicious and cheap.

Haha. ;)|`|aXOyK3uBaa	GREAT question.    No it doesn't make sense.... unless you look at it more closely.    They are -->> TESTING you.    75% of women FLAKE.  (especially on a first date)    Why? Because they want to see how YOU will react.  ITS A TEST. And some women are not even AWARE that they do it.    Part of not being a "wuss" is understand that women will TEST you - ALL THE TIME. You must ASSUME that a woman will flake. And know exactly how to handle it.    ? Sometimes they want to see if you are serious.  ? Sometimes they want to know if you are willing to chase after them  ? Sometimes they want to know if you have standards enough to ***** HER OUT for it... instead of saying "it's ok, we'll do it another time".    You need to -->> MAKE SURE she doesn't flake.    Here's how.    Make FIRM plans with her - including a time and place.  Then say right then and there: "You're definitely going to be there , right? Because I don't tolerate flakiness."    If she says "Oh yeah! Im definitely going to be there"  You just made an impact, and you AVOID THE PROBLEM BEFORE ITS A PROBLEM. If she still flakes, then she just told you she's not worth your time --- and you IGNORE her.    I never have this problem. Now you know why.    Cheers.

ype5N1qEaa	well all that really matters as far as your relationship is concerned is how your girlfriend feels about it. Hopefully if she says she is ok with that means that she actually is.  If she really isn't then it is her responsibility to be honest with you and work out whatever problems there may be.    However, if my best friends boyfriend did that, I would be pissed, and I would tell my best friend that she should be too.  The fact of the matter is that while nothing DID happen, it was extremely irresponsible of you to put yourself in that situation.  Hanging out with someone that you have had a physical relationship with in the past, combining that with alcohol and the intimate setting of your bed is pretty much asking for something to "happen".  You're lucky that it didn't, but thats like walking out in a lightning storm holding a 20 foot metal pole.  If you get out of it unscathed, its a miracle. I would recommend not doing something like that again if you have any respect for your girlfriend at all.|`|3f0439ebe7cdf100832cada550ab973caa	Lucky guy. If I found out or was told by my man his ex slept in our bed with him I'd whoop his ****.  You obviously have a very trusting girl, respect her and ditch your the friends with benefits.|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	Wow you have a really remarkable girlfriend.  I'd be really really upset and most likely break up with you.  Since her best friend is pissed (that is what you said right?) You really need to be careful because there's a fight coming.  As far as your behavior, I think you need to be more considerate of your girlfriend and quit hanging out with your friend with benefits unless she's around.  That is unless you want to lose her.   Would you believe your girl if she "slept" with someone she's been with in the past and told you nothing happened?  Would you believe her if she went out with someone else and said nothing happened?   I hope you start treating her with the same respect she treats you.  But as much as I hate to say it.  This is really only between you and your girl and the best friend needs to stay out of it. (even though they should both kick your @  !!! lol)|`|chZFmJOPaa	Well thats a terribly bad thing to do. I wouldnt keep doing it. Shes trusting you, and I'm surprised she trusted you actually didnt do anything.     I just think her friend is trying to protect her and she has a right to.
41LpZrOxaa	Depends on what YOU are comfortable in giving up.   IF you feel you cant afford to lose anything- then let your partner know. If he doesnt respect your wishes -let him go.it may be the main thing he was intrested in in the first place. You deserve to be treated as a valuable jewel- Dont let someone take your needs as second to their own- your needs should be what is most important to your partner. If they arent- then let that selfish person go. you deserve better.  Good luck!|`|672GbObaaa	not sure what you really want is this person single? & do you know this for sure ? do you love this person? if this person loves you you should not have to give up your things & dont give in.|`|l4ubklbdaa	I put it this way first a sturdy friendship and relationship must exist, and pretty much after that what u do, that u think is romantic will definitely be.  I'm not saying what your partner think would be romantic is not what u should do, because we all try to please each other, but sometimes we try to hard.|`|AA10057370	mind  lol
CaPNcD82aa	I don't think your step-kids do "hate" you.  They may resent the fact that there blood father is not in the picture and therefore react a certain to wards you for taking his place.  The thing is you say you take them every where and that they even call you dad.  In a lot of this type of situations the kids wouldn't want to be with you at all, and they certainly wouldn't want to call you dad.  There may be some confused emotions.  That would only be natural, but don't get overly paranoid.  Sounds like you are way ahead than in so many other cases of step children.    Just enjoy yourself and your new family.  Things will only get better!!!|`|aYY7hvHQaa	No, not all step-children hate their step-fathers, but you've got to keep in mind that most step-children feel that their step-fathers have not only usurped their father's place but have "stolen" their mothers. I don't think it is wise to let them call you "Dad", either, because that only reinforces their resentment and feelings that you have usurped their real Dad's place - and your step-children might even suspect that it is because of you that they never see their real father. Why don't you suggest to them that they call you by your name rather than "Dad"? They might well feel great relief in this, as well as feel less resentment against you.     Another thing, is there any possibility for you to arrange for them to see and spend time with their real father? At any rate, I think it would be wise for you to go to family counseling where trained professionals know how to deal with such issues.    Best of luck - I hope you'll soon develope true bonding with your step-children and have a family life that is full of love and joy.|`|d23aca13370978e420b62a034a5c1c41aa	it's misplaced anger. their birth dad has signed them over to you and they resent that.  but, they are mad at the wrong person, they should be mad at him, not you. you are the one that is making them a home and trying to take care of their future.  i hope someday they wake up and realize this.|`|AA12029758	try to love them they never see there real dad thats annoying try u to love them and take care of them and do not ever let them feel that u hate them surely if u do this they will love u|`|6UUsFFnOaa	its hard bc ur taking the place of their real dad, they have resentment towards their real dad for not being there and they take it out on you.
jwAYxrKBaa	Other than the obvious looks, brains, and sense of humor, the main thing i care about in a girl is if she loves me back equally...    It is SOO hard to find a girl with all the things you are looking for, get connected with her, but feel like you're spilling a lot more into the relationship.. its a sucky feeling and it makes a person not want to pursue and instead wait...|`|W3HQwrgBaa	Great legs!

I think you should tell him that him saying that is hurting you much more. : /|`|el2blDi4aa	hahaha|`|bbIUTevlaa	Wow, whatta playa.   Don't worry girrlie; I'm going through something like this right now, but I'm not sure yet on which side his feelings are on.   Just forget about him.  It's gonna hurt real bad, but after a few tears and a nice shower (haha) just think of it as a lesson learned.   Every girl's going to run into a player.|`|3RrD3Rs6aa	he probly sees u as more of a "main girl"  which for u is good...means he wants to play around more with other  girls till he either gets nowhere with them or just gets tired  of running around like that....and then he'll probly wanna   come back to u....of course he wouldnt tell u that    basically saying that the "other girls r just side dishes  he wants to have have as much ice cream as he can before  he thinks it finally time to settle with the main course    or i could be wrong about all that stuff  and maybe hes just an idiot-lol
PCBQbQmraa	Well i talk a lot so she can't talk more then me. JK i like a friend that talks as much as me a good friend is someone who won't stab you in the back someone that i click with from the start is pretty damn awsome!|`|teNUDFtGaa	that have to be fun good sense of humor, have same interests, like the same fashion i do,be in shape and good hygiene so when we go out togther or at school we always look good :D|`|exHroh8Maa	pretty, intellegent, good taste in music, no history of being slutty :)|`|SS0Aqvuzaa	Girl you cant pick a friend it comes to you, but this is what  a friend is! Someone who is always there, through thick and thin; Someone who is only a phone call away.Someone who is there to share your thoughts with; Someone to listen, no matter the subject.Someone who will guard your deepest secrets; Someone who will never let you down.    That's what a real friend does!|`|5tl1uLgVaa	For me I don't have any requirements or standards, I love people. When I meet someone new it's either we click or we don't. But there are the obvious qualities that no one likes, fake, egocentric, rude, shallow; you know. I tend to stay away from girls who are flirts. It drives me nuts to be with a girl who non-stop talks about guy or in the middle of a conversation she turns and starts jabbering to Ryan over there. Those are girls I try to click with but I just can't, I mean I don't hate them and I can tolerate them for a short period of time but not as a long term friend    My bestfriend is absolutely amazing. She's honestly like a big sister to me. Only she gets my retarded jokes and only I get her stupid humour. When she farts I laugh and she laughs and then we're both laughing our heads off till we don't know what just happened. When she sees me crying she'll come over and hug my head like Lloyd and Harry from Dumb and Dumber. When either of us is sad we bring each other Taco Bell :) I'm the only one she can pray aloud in front of. for us, silence is GOLDEN. When friends can go 5 minutes without talking and not be akward, that's a good sign of a strong friendship. For me that is what I look for in a friend :)|`|MAAxboH7aa	When I smile at them, even though we didn't know each other then, they smile back. And well, I guess you could say that my buddies are all very talkative.    They also listen to you, they tell you their stories, allow them to hold their pet hamsters, allow them to sleepover, give them their number.     They don't necessarily like the same things as I do, so we argue jokingly quite a lot then go out to have coffee and see a movie, and all arguments are forgotten. Those are the kind of friends mine are.|`|XAFsuIBYaa	What I look for in a friend are sense of humor, they respect everyone the way they want to be treated. I would stay away from stuck, 2 faced people. Just remember that 1st impressions are very important.|`|rqSVDNbbaa	Iam male by gender its an interesting question so I just got peeped in..     By law  I would never choose my friends on conditions & qualities but i love to GAIN them with time by not leaving chance OF doubtfulness in mind, Knowing friendship is Destiny Life is journey we have to carry them al through the way of our life in good & bads .......I have lot of friends   with fake smiles....... just being ignorant with out knowing the meaning friendship....  A good friend will treat your mistakes with his/her smile by leaving the hope that you should never try again for bad  & bad friend is the one who laughs on your mistakes........
PYyUvN05aa	1.  Mostly eyes.  Pretty eyes get to me. =-)  At the same time, I like girls with nice eyes.  My sis commented that one of the girls that I thought of as cute was "ordinary-looking."  Must be because she has that nice smile haha.      2. Depends.  I find 'em all attractive.  =D      Make-up - NO.  I think women tend to look nicer without it on average.  Eye-liner and mascara occasionally tends to scare me.
4vv1ElyJaa	Well if the only sign you have is her talking to you, then I doubt it. Just coz I talk to a guy after he talks to me doesnt mean I like him. I usually dont start conversations because I'm shy.|`|TfSIOwaSaa	you first ask them
qLwBd2yfaa	both|`|9xVwpZ0faa	they seem creepy|`|LPKHGAgEaa	Abvious..  He was hitting on you n yeah He likes you..|`|C2DBglhnaa	I think these guys were just hitting on you. If they were serious, they would have most likely asked for your number, or they would have asked you to meet up with them again.|`|xaDK9Dceaa	he just wanted to stare at someone probably|`|tFC13Xsgaa	usually when i like a girl  i look at her a lot
aXOyK3uBaa	Man . . . . women are willing to take off their clothes IMMEDIATELY.     The only reason they WON'T is because -->> they want to see how long you will be stupid enough to date them while thinking you have to date them for as long as they can keep you at arms length.    Don't put out unless women do.    Dating is not enjoyable (or worth your time) otherwise.    Cheers.    OH! And I love the above answers from other women -->> "wait a few months". Jesus. Do women really think men are interested in getting involved with women who INTENTIONALLY go into a "relationship" being UNFULFILLING??? Its a wonder these women call men "cheaters" ...... when they work that hard to CHEAT MEN OUT OF IT.    Why don't you girls just stay home and stay single.    .....instead of making men feel like they should APOLOGIZE for wanting to have sex with women. That's the entire biological POINT between men and women in the first place. Unbelievable.|`|ykADw6ldaa	that is a stupid question|`|EqTrzzixaa	it's all chemistry....if she's "into you" you will know....just don't be all weird about it, the less you think about getting into her pants the quicker you probablly will|`|r2gonS44aa	Shoot, on average if I like a guy, a couple months... BUT there is a loop hole.       If you know any gals, that you used to hang out with, but haven't banged.   Get out your little black book and call up some old numbers, let them know you just want to get together for a movie and some wine if they are down.  (Make it casual)      Then start the mack attack.    I just went to see a guy I hadn't seen for 4 years or so... we've known eachother for about 7-8 years, and we'd never slept together... long story short.           3 days...|`|i1rDJY2aaa	After my divorce, I dated for a while until I met my now husband. We dated for a few months, and it wasn't until we were committed to each other and we both said "I love you" and meant it, that we slept together.   In this day and age, there are too many married men looking to cheat, STD's, and players for women to hop into bed with just anyone. We have to be very careful.|`|qBhVZbnTaa	Whatever you're comfortable with. If you want to sleep with him after the first date then do it, but understand that he may only be after sex.     And honestly, the whole thing is your comfort level. If you're feeling it/into it then go for it.|`|tPlJX0Jmaa	Well just go with the flow and see where it leads if it doesnt go anywhere after that oh well just tick off to some experience huh cant hurt either way|`|75SSAFsPaa	It depends on the guy.If he is just after sex like you seem to be I use him dry then leave him with big blue balls.|`|sYwkpH7Jaa	after some couples of months !!!!!! it cant be after 1 date isn't it !!!!!!|`|TjMZ9Lbxaa	take her to dinner,movie then take her home a bang her good and if she doesnt give it up move on|`|HlfgMoi4aa	that is up to u. it is your body. if u want ot wait then do so. if he really cares he will wait.  mildred is my leader|`|498JdszFaa	Well we're all different so it depends on the woman and what she expects of you. If it's sex then why delay it?    Oh and about taking the lead, again depends on the woman. If she is dominant you will find out soon enough. I personally like some convincing behavior by my partner.|`|XjtZAFOyaa	wait a couple months|`|AA11313204	i dont know about legth of time. but i do think there has to be some sort of trust established.|`|aY3s1B9xaa	If you're looking for a relationship that'll last, wait a few months.  That'll show her you can treat her like a lady and show her some respect.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	depends on how many you can handle!|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	When do you think your going to shut the hell up and do something worth typing you retard? :)    Eat ME! GO WASH YOURSefffffffffff YOU FILTH PIGS! :)|`|rlayqcGjaa	3 dates|`|GRuIq6Igaa	It depends on the woman and what your expectations are.  Are you dating simply for sex?  Or are you seeking another relationship that ends in marriage.  If you are simply looking for sex, then you will find those types of women who will want you to tear their clothes off and go at it.  They usually want you to leave some cash behind when your done.  You will find what you are looking for.|`|uReFjOONaa	umm wait for a week
fkH2VnFUaa	This is where you find out who you married. If he is your husband, he will be a man and stand up for you. If he doesn't you didn't marry a "man" and you will never have a "husband".    This is the difference between men and boys - men know better than to let their mommies be the "other" woman.|`|AA10461616	As long as you and your husband know the baby is his, that is all that matters.  What should you do?  Have a talk with your husband about what she is saying.  It's up to him to tell her he won't tolerate his wife and future child to be disrespected.  If she can't act respectful to you, then he needs to cut ties with her, mother or not. A mature man would realize his mother isn't stable and set some very clear rules for her now.  He is an adult making a family.  If she wants to be part of your lives, she needs to follow your rules as a new family.  Traditional marriage vows say the spouse and children come before parents when one marries.|`|498JdszFaa	Tell her to mind her own business. Also: talk to your hubby and explain to him he should take a stand with you. You need his support.|`|chZFmJOPaa	Sounds like his mother needs to take a hike and get her ovaries removed.|`|9bdEPcWIaa	Your husband has to step up and protect his family, you and the baby, he has to tell his mom to butt out.|`|AA11996507	The only thing you need to do is leave your mama's boy of a husband IF he doesn't step up to the plate and stand up for you.  It is HIS job to tell his mother that she is out of line.|`|0VBESmFQaa	If he is a gown man he will know who comes first in his life,Now if he is buying into it then you need to set him right and let him know that it's all about you 2.No one else has any say in your relationship with him|`|AA10080676	"Kill the with kindness"    that's my mother used to sy.    Be sincere, be cheery (even when she insults you) and pull your weight.(be proactive not helpless)    Your qualities will shine through and by being the bigger person you will avoid the stress of constant conflict and people ill se your mother-in-la and as mall person and you are great person.    It will not be easy but if you can do it, it will work.|`|iWOrlfotaa	Go ahead and let your husband know in advance that you will be discussing this with her. Let her know that while you understand that she loves her son and that yes he is still her son but that he is married . Which means he has his own family. Let her know that you are aware of her lack of preference to you. And while she can despise you  all she wants she will not put that on your child. And that if she continues to say and behave in the manner she does that she wont be a part of her grandchild's life . PERIOD. and if your husband isn't on the same boat then that means hes not on your boat at all. When your pregnant he is either all on board or not at all. Your hormones are going to be all over the place. The last thing you need is an unstable husband who cant stand up to his mother, who is creating difficulty, for his pregnant wife and  a mother in law who is encouraging his son to what?! since the baby isn't for him to what not have the baby?!?!? what is she insinuating with that remark anyway. Anyone that isn't going to be positive in your life now. remove them. it will make for a happy transition into the best part of your life. Being a MOM!|`|AA11587827	what are u saying, that the baby isnt for him, or do u mean the baby isnt his, why would she say that, does she have reason to, i can not see that much hate in a person to say something like that, for no reason|`|eT9cRbgFaa	my ex mother in law did the same thing, i fell prego, told the father and then he left me the same night!! the stress and heart break caused me to lose it!!!!!!!!!!     the bast thing to do is not to fight it!!!! dont allow her to get to you, it cause unwanted stress to the child!!! (been through 2 miscarriages!!!!!)    speak to your husband and explain to him how you feel and that you feel shes tying to get between you too, he will probally take his mothers side, but talk to him and explain to him how or why shes doing it, confront his mother and ask her why she thinks its not his.....     find out what her problem is and try sort it out but dont cause meaningless stress for the kid!!!!!!!!|`|GoEaSOSraa	Sit down with that woman and let her know that she isn't going to break you and that you have a child coming into this world and if she is going to keep up that negativity, then she won't be allowed to see her grandbaby...not until she gets her act straight at least. And really, you're husband must be lacking a pair of balls if he is letting his mom disrespect you like that. You are his wife. He better recognize
59CaFeS8aa	Get professional help of doctors or counsellors.    Otherwise, use physical threat- Threaten to break legs, if you can.|`|yfRVFBmwaa	Well if you're dedicated to the cause, just take his mind off it with sex every time he wants to drink ;)|`|bk2K8NMsaa	Just take him to a anti-alcoholic treatment centre(If there is one).|`|IB36yrr6aa	Best to stop him to drink :    1. You have to become rude after having beer and it effected you more.  2.  Do feel unwell next morning because of heavy drink.  3. Give him the drink more than he wanted.  4. Mix cigarette ash in the drink|`|5aKUV5afaa	This is a bad situation waiting to get worse.  Also, there are many variables.  I am not judging or talking out of my but.  I am really talking to you as a wife of an alcoholic.  Stop drinking with him or around him.  And quit putting up with it.  Tell him, when he is sober, I'm done.  And mean it.  Move out or at least make it look like you moved out.  The variables are, do you have children? Do you have somewhere to go?  Is he ever violent when he's drunk?    If you don't have any children with him, you might be better off just parting company.|`|KjkOT5rfaa	Try to talk to your husband about why he drinks. If you can get him to open up to you, then maybe you can find a substitute for drinking.|`|0VBESmFQaa	Don't leave him because that will just give him another reason,Help in through it and things will be okay|`|GqPHkGHxaa	show him some people who have died becuase of drinking,take him to slum & show they drink impure water due to fate but he drinks purposely a conatminated water decently said as wine,in that slum show the disabled,poor people in need of money for education etc,take him to rehabitualisation center & meditation center|`|h3yQMguraa	Next time he's drunk and acting stupid, like pissing on the TV, videotape him and show it to him when he's sober.|`|2wt9bZGQaa	go to like sessions to deal wiv the problem|`|eLxcDtItaa	Go to Alcoholics Anonymous with him. it sounds like he may have a serious problem.|`|AA12311278	Threaten him with the one thing that matters the most to him...you. Tell him your tired of it and you'll leave him if he doesn't quit. It's harsh but effective.|`|DGIUaDLYaa	He has a drinking problem and needs professional help. Send himto AA. If he does not go, well, that is his choice. You either have to accept this or move on.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Stand up for yourself.    Do not ask. Demand.  Tell him to go to therapy - and if he refuses, he can pack his things and go.    Enjoying a beer or being so totally drunk that you urinate on the TV are different things.   He has an alcohol addiction, or is an alcoholic - and should go for therapy.     If he does not want to - then it is simple - he does not love you, and by his unwillingness he actually says that he thinks that his urges and desires (for drink) are more important than you.    So, that would mean, if he refuses, you should kick him out, permanently. Painful for now, but saves you lot of pain and hurt in the (near) future.|`|Vv6BQU4laa	tell him if u dont stop   i will start drinking  & if  still he drinks then start drinking but in presence of him just act it|`|T2EscNssaa	consulting a specialist is the best thing to be done. bt if u want to ackle it urslf dn c to d fact dat y did he gt in to this habit all of a sudden. most of the trime ppl resort to these means b'cz of tension so u cn talk to him! n make him read articles or watch programmes showing adverse effect of drinking! try spending mre time with him so dat he doesnt gt time to drink as he doesnt do dat in front of u!hope he'll gt over gud luck|`|frtnEo4Uaa	please tell your husband serious adverse effects on liver on regular drinking.convince him in such a way that he will feel fear of liver cirrhosis.also if u have children tell himthat beer have ruined many families and it can also happen in case of your family|`|HumLQPDhaa	I think you should join him and see what your missing out on honey.

People with substance abuse issues often must hit bottom and see no way out before they choose to make up their mind to quit.  Ultimately he has to want want to only then will he chose to seek help.|`|xxvLfLrYaa	don't give him sex|`|t26ctJdraa	u cant do crap. when he is ready he will quit! until then good luck|`|qy07K2k5aa	I think you should just tell him how much it's hurting you, how much you love him and want him to stop.

J0RJ3MS7aa	when she has no interest in me but uses me for free food while she scopes out other guys|`|CvZSW1wjaa	Q: Is there something you dont wanna see in your date?  A: If I go out to dinner on a date and he doesn't say "thank you" or is just not very polite with the waiter/waitress then I usually know things are not going to work out.  Makes me wonder how he will start treating me...    Q: When do you consider your date a nightmare?  A: Hahah if he is into Journey.  Dont ask me why that is my answer.

fJodD2WSaa	first....what u did may scared the heck out of her....    next,....she slapped u cos she's scared and she's embarrassed    DOn't worry...guess what she'll do next....    You'll be in her dreams...she will think about u all da time and wonder why you licked her arm....she will thought that you liked her, probably....    try wait the next day and see if she look straight into your eyes...    if she do, then she's probably mad or trying to have a good look at you and decide what to do, either to like you or not...    sometimes shy girls can avoid eye contacts no matter how they like you unless you address them...    If you really like her, try approach her again and apologize and said that what you did isn't for purpose...its just by accident or whatever reasons you can come up with....    Beware also, cos some girls can be rough and they also have a lot of pride in them...try to have a time alone with her and apologize to her for what you did and maybe to start over again...that'll work also...    Just be careful not to mumbling to yourself like some boys that have the lack of courage...    DOn't worry you'll do fine...Just be courageous and be cautious . Then all will be fine...    Good Luck...She'll probably thinking of you right now...    Good Luck    Hope it helps...|`|N1qKXDs2aa	......................seriously?|`|lK3TXGBOaa	eeeewwww no!!! why would you do something like that!!! you probably scared her away...sorry but no i dont think she likes you.
EZKe92TTaa	you've got to involve social services immediately and tell them everything. you didn't mention anything about your father. is there one? if so is he in the picture at all? regardless, act quickly, time is essential. talk to his school advisor, they can be very helpful too and are obligated to keep things confidential. you were lucky to get out of a very sticky situation, you could have easily ended up in the streets or worse. your brother may not be so lucky, so get the authorities involved now. he is in an abusive home and her treatment of him (and you of course) is considered neglect.|`|KxAmrVBfaa	Just get him to leave     Or talk to child services and tell them everything     They will put in care and probably into your care|`|7eI0kW5Uaa	IT WAS YOUR FAULT, AND YOUR CHOSE FOR CHOOSING TO SMOKE WEEK AND DRINK.      it is not all her fault that he's failing, or smoking weed, or even drinking,  he should know better for doing this. with a mother like this, the best thing that may happen to me is education, be successful and get the hell out of here.      yes, you can get custody of him.

If you like being with more than one women then maybe you should just forget about having a girlfriend and just have "sex buddies" or "one-night stands".  It's not fair to your gf.

I'm not suggesting that you are, I'm just laying out the different scenarios. Unless you are attracted to other men, you are not gay.

K6vEbdqxaa	It is absolutely not wrong!  Trusting someone is one thing but being stupid is a whole nother thing!  Once in a while, though I trust my man, I still look through his phone.  I have absolutely no problem if he does the same to mine!  I have nothing to hide, and since we are engaged to be married, he shouldn't either!  Trust only goes so far, and I was cheated on by my ex husband, a man who I KNEW would never do something like that to me!  Yet he did, and I won't ever be put into that situation again!  My current fiancee knows about by past and my issues, so if he loves me he will deal with it!  I have no problem with dealing with his issues from his past either!|`|FYi8nNzcaa	Most people who have nothing to hide probably wouldn't have a problem with it, if they were in a serious relationship.  But as it goes I would ask before doing so.  How would you feel if your spouse did it?.  I think sometimes a little common courtesy goes a long way, just like not opening mail addressed to someone else (it's actually illegal).  I think Emails and Phone Messages etc fall in this category.    I personally wouldn't.  If its anything important or relevant to you your spouse I would image would let you know.|`|kGMzw5YNaa	you can see but in limit you have to inform (him or her) that you have seen.never make your spouses angry and take (him or her) in confidence for a better and happier life.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	I don't go though my husband's things (email ,phone, internet history etc). He used to go through mine constantly until we started counseling. He would even delete my new text messages from people HE didn't like (man or woman)     For a long time I didn't care because I had nothing to hide. But it gets to a point when it becomes irritating when they constantly look through your things expecting to find something wrong. They are blatantly saying "I don''t trust you". They need to explain what they're constantly looking for.     And to clarify, I only mean this is if it's every single day, not just once a month or something.Curiosity is human nature.|`|f8fs6kycaa	Friend...according to me spouse is some1 who you dont expect to hide anything from you...and i think that if my partner wants his or her own space then there's no problem...(doesnot mean that he should do something against your relation)i think if my partner wants to tell me something which i should know he will tell for sure...    when will you feel like checking your partners mails or phone (not extactly)but if you feel a little doubt inside inside your heart...u maynot even know that...    and some spouse donot like chaecking their mails or phone...its their nature...i guess...    finally it all depends on how strong your relation is...|`|c3d7df69e794159e65f7371d58243a42aa	Once trust is real in a relationship then that alone will be the guide to  not have to look at phone texts, or e-mails, and until both parties have  that , then it's whatever one feels to do to the other, but until the trust  is established, then the relationship is never guaranteed to be a lasting  one. I know because I and my hubby have gotten the trust part and I  never check his cell, , or anything else, and he does not  have to check any of my e-mails, etc, and that trust has been going  on over 22yrs now, and that is one of the things why we are happily  married.|`|ff808798af8598e0f6e73fd47f6bb690aa	I think when you are married there should not be any secrets.

So although people say things like it's an invasion of privacy I think anyone would look if their spouses phone was left sitting right beside them and also if no one ever glanced then cheaters would never get caught.|`|dnA6sAFqaa	It's only fine to do so if the other person doesn't mind and you have their permission - otherwise it is an invasion of privacy.  When people are married or living together they may be a couple but that doesn't mean that they shouldn't lose their individuality too. It is still important to respect one another. We do not own the other person - nor do we have a right to rummage through all their things.    As I said, this is only acceptable if neither partner minds.|`|AA10413046	Looking at your spouse's emails or phone is perfectly acceptable.  When you are married you and your life should be an open book to your spouse period.|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	It IS an invasion of privacy. Of course people have some things to hide! EVERYONE does. Hard to throw a surprise party or vent about a minor problem to your mom if your spouse is spying on you. People have private thoughts and opinions, and even a spouse does not have a right to interfere with every single one. That is just looking for trouble. I agree that relationships are about honesty and trust... one more reason NOT to invade their privacy. If you have honesty and trust, there is no reason to look at their private stuff.    The exception: if you have a concrete REASON to think your spouse is hiding something important: i.e. an affair, illegal activity, or serious money problem.|`|KncPJwIaaa	Its the principle about it when you just be nosy it ain't cool and we don't have nothing to hide if you don't look for nothing to find|`|vy5TCwTjaa	Very interesting question. I believe that when you marry someone you have to agree to lose all your privacy and everything should be transparent. so it should be ok to listen in because if they dont have anything to hide it shouldnt matter|`|Q79IWCBxaa	Heck no it's NOT wrong to look at spouses phone.

Marriage does not mean that you cease to exist as a person. I trust my wife and she has never given me any reason not to.|`|AA10772811	If there is nothing to hide then it should be okay. I dont hide my phone or e-mail... but my ex did and he had very good reason to.... he was cheating!!!|`|PRUXtYh5aa	Never okay under any circumstances.  My wife snooped into my personal job related stuff for one of my jobs once and only once.  She was having self confidence issues and thought I was doing something that could hurt her.  She found out otherwise and was so shocked and ashamed that I doubt she will do it again. I fortunately don't work with any data like that anymore so there is nothing to hide, but boy was she suspicious for a time.  Why is it that women are so paranoid?  My wife, her sisters, my mom, ex girlfriends, couple women at work, and on and on.  All dealing with paranoia and believing there husbands may be having an affair, chatting, or whatever.  Self esteem and confidence issues I'm sure.  Trust. You must have trust.  If you don't have that, you have very little to build on.  Don't look.    Wow.  reading some of these responses I am shocked at how many women think it is okay to look.  That is appalling.  Trust means nothing?  Where is the integrity.  If a man looked at your email or phone or whatever you would be disgusted.  Shameful.|`|d5duruQaaa	For me, yes I think it's an invasion of privacy, i wouldn't like it if my husband invaded my e-mails... i know we should be able to share everything with our husband but we still need our private space. Even if we have nothing to hide it makes no difference, sometimes we need to be an individual and independent just like how we need our own friends (don't know if the last sentence made sense)|`|umsyPxlEaa	I agree with the 2nd part, there shouldnt b a problem in less they are hiding something.|`|bITTzzcVaa	Theres nothing wrong with it!    If a spouse makes a big deal of it, its probably because they DO have something to hide.|`|SIfrAHxraa	If your spouse is hiding something....then yes....by all means, invade their privacy.  But if you do, and you don't like what you see and you become paranoid....just ask questions.  Don't go in there thinking your gonna find something you don't like.

It shouldn't matter if you look at each others phones or emails. If neither of you have nothing to hide, no harm done.|`|HqkZA842aa	Its sounds as if though you have trust issues. I wonder if he has cheated before and thats why you are doing it. I would understand that he knows that you check on it, but if you are doing it behind his back than that seems more wrong. Just thing about it this way if he was snooping around your phone and email with out you noticing would it bother you? Even though you say you have nothing to hide, but just the fact that he doubted you will hurt you. Wish you the best!|`|MLdykhQNaa	I'd recommend staying with your avatar's name and not doing it.  It's not going to be about hiding something when he finds out.  It's going to come down to trust and respect for him.  Once someone loses that it's really hard to get back.|`|fLASTynLaa	I believe it's wrong, everyone needs they're own personal space.  Assuming that most people that look through phones and emails feel they will find something, otherwise why do it.Besides, why be with someone you can't trust?|`|gNFPy6S0aa	My wife and I would never dream of reading each other's email without being specifically invited to.  Being married doesn't mean you cease to be separate people.  There's a difference between "combining" your lives, and sharing them with each other.  Everybody needs space of their own, and everybody is entitled to privacy.  If you're so mistrustful of your spouse that you feel that you need to spy on them, then you need to examine why there's no trust there. If there's no real reason for the lack of trust, then spying on them is going to guarantee that they will also lose trust in you.  If there IS a reason for the lack of trust, then you probably know what it is already, and that's the problem you need to confront.|`|GuK9yLGJaa	i would say its fine to do that, why is it wrong and why is the privacy needed if he or she has nothing to hide then they wont have a problem with it if. the only reason someone would have a problem with it is if they were doing something wrong.|`|U3bGuLPraa	yes and no! the intention can speak for it. if youre both open its a great and its not really a big deal, but i do believe in woman instinct.... just the same managing your emotion will play a great role. alert not to lead to serious matter. let him know to keep your family safe from intruder. your goodwill is the best solution|`|q92ySEjkaa	This deserves a star.    If both parties feel its ok, like in your case where you feel your husband should tell you if there's new msgs its ok.  It also depends on why you want to look at his personal things.  I sometimes look at my husbands phone to see the msg that came through but other times when I doubt him or our marriage i look to see who's been calling and its wrong.  And the reason why I say that is because in looking at his phone or emails you have already in your mind established a reason for not trusting him.  And any marriage will fail without trust whether you find something on the phone or in his emails today, tomorrow or never.      We should trust our partners and have faith in God that our partners will be faithful to us.  You and your partner should share everything, that really is the best solution to every marriage and I personally think that if he doesn't want you going through his stuff, he probably does have something to hide, but in saying that aren't I already in my mind convicting him of something he might not have done.      Keep in mind that some people just like their privacy more than others not because they're hiding stuff but because that's how they were raised for instance.|`|5d32Q1Craa	You should only want to see your spouses e-mail if you have a valid reason to.. Even in marriage there is such a thing as respecting and trusting someones privacy. A valid reason would be is if you suspect an affair, or if you find internet transactions on bank statements which confirmations are usually sent to an e-mail address.. When an X of mine was acting suspicious I got into her e-mail and found that she was telling some guy she was single and wanting to meet.. She got the boot that night :)

People would tell me about it and I would always assume it was just a cover for some other reason they may have chosen to back away from me.  It wasn't until I dated my first clingy girl that it dawned on me.  From then on, I was free of my clingy problem.   I suspect the clingers will change also, when it's done to them.  Most people just don't realize they're smothering you.|`|bC5XeVEIaa	I think your boyfriend needs to dump you and find someone who deserves him. I think too many women are insatiable, and will label a guy as clingy if he loves her and shows it, but an insensitive jerk if he doesn't make his world revolve around her. I think girls like you believe that a boyfriend is only to be of use at your convenience, not at his, and on call 24/7. That's what I think.    Get over yourself.|`|rmC59Zv9aa	im a guy but i think clingy guys would make better bf's then those who aren't... They will always be there for you|`|mbuB22D2aa	I dont have a problem with it at all

Don't lie about big things, but there's no need to tell him about "stretching the truth" on little things. Its all gonna be fine, just stop thinking about it and dont feel guilty. The things you told him, you did it just because you liked him, and if he ever finds out just say that you really cared for him and you didn't want him to stop liking you if you told him the truth. it'll be fine =]]

gIeRIrQoaa	What I take from this, is that your parents are concerned with the lifestyle you are choosing to have.That's great that you're handling your finances in a responsible way, but that's not the issue here.I dont know exactly how much you drink or smoke so I cant tell you its because you do it excessively. I'm just saying that going to bars often, and smoking (weed maybe?) alot isn't considered living healthy lifestyle. That's probably why they're upset with you..    You're doing a great job being responsible! But I think once you shave off the edges,(changing some bad habits) you're parents will get off your case for good! That seems to be the only area that could use some improvement for you thus far.. Hope I was of help to you.|`|DR0GRkueaa	I hate situations like this because it's just so sad. First, depending on  your father's circumstances you should probably stop supporting him, and your mother is not right in letting you pay the bills while she goes about telling you who you can date and where you can go.

Yes, they are your parents, but you're not financially responsible for them. Did your father ever pay child support on your behalf? I'm sure if he didn't, he would be quite surprised how much back pay he owes. No one can take advantage of you unless you allow them to. Good parents deserve respect and love, not financial gain from their children.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	They are adults and they need to grow up. If you leave, they will be forced to act like adults for once.

Next time they complain say, Im going to quit, if you treat me like a kid, you need to support me like one.|`|4SFHGHyfaa	Stop typing in caps,  All will respect you.|`|sVrkjixAaa	Tell them to shut up. Why you are supporting your father when you haven't seen him for fifteen years is beyond me. There comes a point where generosity crosses into stupidity. Cut him off and make him get a job, if he can't get a job make him get welfare. It sounds rude to speak to your parents in this way, but you are an adult and you are basically enabling their lifestyles and they are unappreciative of it if they treat you like that.|`|AA11091233	WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU CAN STOP WRITING IN CAPS AS IT IS WIDELY KNOWN AS YELLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  lol    If moving is not an option...I would simply sit down with your parents and explain exactly what you said here. Perhaps they may be seeing a side of you they are concerned about...like drinking too much or the kind of people you hang out with. A lot of times people that know us best see things we don't see ourselves. By the way...don't you have to be 21 before you drink?    I have no idea how YOU got stuck at the age of 19 caring for 2 parents when your life should be more carefree and focused on friends, career etc. How did that happen? They are not being fair to you in any way. I dont' know how they can live with themselves knowing you are supporting them and can't have a life of your own. I just have a feeling getting out on weekends and partying is like you saying you deserve to let loose...and that could possibly what they see...you take it as them trying to control you...it could possibly be just concern.    If that is not the case...you just have to set some serious boundaries. You MUST tell them you are not a child, you are paying the bills and it simply is not at all okay for them to try and control you. Be strong and firm.    Maybe you live in Canada, thus the drinking age is different. Anyway...are you absolutely positive there isn't a way for them to get some money or assistance of their own? What would happen to them if you weren't around? Why are you paying for a father who you haven't seen? All of this is extremely unhealthy and not good for YOU honey.    You are one heck of a daughter...they should be kissing you and thanking God they have such a wonderful daughter.|`|y999LLxdaa	Sound like you have the right to do what you want. Now how to deal with your mom, fighting is not the best choices because it does nothing to prove your grown up it does the opposite, try laying down your rules and stick with them be firm don't fight and don't back down just let them know that thats what you decided and thats how it will be. Good Luck.|`|AA10852092	get ur own crib|`|sxKrb98Caa	First off, you are too young to have that big of a burden. I don't know the story about your parents and its good you feel that way, that you want to take care of them. But right now is the time in your life where you have to worry about yourself and your future. Sit down have a talk with them tell them how you really feel, how tired you are and everything you want to say. I don't know but if you dont do anything now, it might get worst, might lead to other things. Goodluck and don't hold anything in|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	Dude no offence but your dad is a jackass you havn't seen him since you were 4 so what the hell is he doing with the money that you are giving him?? Seriously your parents are a huge problem. Your mum needs a part time job and so does your dad. Its not fair for you to do all this work you should be enjoying your time with friends and going out like any other teenager you shouldn't be put in the middle by your parents. SInce your parents live in separate places there is seriously a problem in between they and they are using you.|`|wCZ3T5QLaa	Well consider this, your father who havent seen since your four years old doesnt exactly deserve everything your doing for him. Your mother of course, if shes incapable of  working, does deserve this help, however if shes capable of work get out now. Your 19 and they are holding you back. You are 110% right in this situation. If you decide to move out try finding a roommate to split the bills. But definitely dont let them rule your life. Do what you want to do and do it well. Dont let anyone hold you back on your pursuit to happiness.|`|DEHxp2eTaa	Tell your mom get a damn job & if she says "get out", then leave, she's not doing nothing for the bills, you're bread winner & you're ONLY 19! I feels sorry for you....|`|iIu41fRXaa	Take a deep breath. Don't get so up tight about this situation. You can go to court and emancipate yourself if you want. You might need to find a lawyer. You deserve a better life and I can see how you don't want to abandon your parents. Tell your mom you are thinking of emancipating yourself, she'll realize how much you do for her and start supporting for the both of you and most importantly herself. After she starts supporting herself you go find a apartment thats affordable and close to work and possibly school. If you aren't in college try to work in a community college near you. I do not know you very well but from what you've told me you don't sound very grown up "I'm 19 years old....I go to bars and drink and smoke." 1st of all drinking is an issue I can see already you go every weekend and your 19. If you think your an adult you aren't quit one if you cant handle alcohol maturely or follow laws correctly. I think I've said enough. Follow my advice please, you'll live a happier fuller life.
e5cbcb4ac6c942012d08df3df6d9915baa	If you go to bed at the usual hour that you do then set an alarm on your cell phone to vibe about 2 hours later just in case you actaully end up falling asleep. Then if you have a car you get in, put it in Nuetral (keep the lights off) and push it to the end of the street (a lot easier then it sounds once you get it going) once you are at the end of the street you can start the car and turn the lights on when you turn the corner.    If you tell your parents you are staying at a friends house do not have that same friend tell her parents she is staying at yours. Way to risky. Tell them you are staying at "Beths" and have Beth tell her parents she is staying at someone else's house. That way you dont have her parents possibly calling your. You will only have to worry about your parents trying to get a hold of the Beth's.     GOOD LUCK!|`|412167FVaa	Dangerous,dangerous, dangerous.  This is fire, touch and it will certainly burn your fingers|`|df9a2bc65b9256f2948d5b73efcf40fdaa	well if your parents dont check on you after you go to sleep you could always remove the screen off your window and just leave. my friend removed the screen from her window and propped it in the bushes outside during the daytime while her parents weren't home to get rid of the noise problem, and then later that night after she went to bed she just opened up the window and left. the only problem is getting back in, she lived in a safe neighborhood so she left the window cracked just enough so she could fit her wrist through to open it back up. if youre worried about your parents finding out just leave a note saying you went for a drive because you were stressed out and will be back shortly or something...good luck! :D    and you could try setting your clocks forward so they go to bed earlier? i'm just saying things off the top of my head now x)|`|AA11313204	dont do it. period. stop trying to grow up so fast. you want your kids sneaking out? whats wrong with you?|`|gRsuXxkbaa	stay @ home
QLiNak0Naa	OMG u are in my exact same position about 6  months ago. i am 18 and about 6 months ago i was feeling exactly the same as you.i too used to think about being kissed all the time and watched romance and had pitty for myself. i was pretty but no guys in school ever noticed me. u know what? here is ur answer:  when u have been around a bunch of people for a while, they tend to think of you as that little kid even when u are older and gorgeous. so its not ur problem but the guys problem. for me, i was so confused until i got a job this summer and met some one who really made me happy. my first boyfriend and my first kiss. we say we want it to be special but its no possible because once u leave them, the first kiss will become such a bitter memory u wanna spit it out.  anyway, what we saw in the movies is not true! they are so unrealistic. real relationships are different. after 4 months when he left me for another girl, that is when i understood the true meaning of a relationship. it was sweet while it lasted but left a scar for the left of my life in my heart.  so i guess my advise is i know its really hard to wait and u wanna resist the urge but once u kiss, it will even become worse. so if u cant resist it now, after u kiss u get out of control. wait and the boy will find u. if u want a BF u need to put urself in a new group of pple where u can meet new pple and choose among them. thats my advise. i can totally help u with this i know how u feel. feel free to talk to me  honeygirl_001@yahoo.ca|`|WXCa8zQoaa	woa this is so the same situation im in i guess all i can tell you is that your not alone in this world|`|nK8n2uSgaa	You can't force love. When the love of your life comes along you will know. You ahould just try dating around for now. Be yourself and oneday you will find the one|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	It's nice that you want to save your kiss for someone special. If that's what you want to do, that should be reason enough for you not to kiss or do anything.|`|eMFRN0HCaa	Hmmm.... I am a guy and this is a hard one. It is very hard to find your one true love the first time. If you would like to know what it is like, I would just do it. Kissing doesn't make you a bad person if you are religious. Saving yourself is different and good. I guess it also matters how old you are. Go for it|`|m5aenb6qaa	I believe you are in love with love because technically you did not yet find the right person to be in love with. You should wait for the right guy to come. coz love comes naturally and as a destiny. you cannot ask for it to come because you only want to feel "in love".     being in love with a person is different than being in love with love. Being in love with a person means you are ready to accept him as who he is rather than expecting the type of relationship that you wanted to be in with him. have fun while you are still young because when you get into a relationship, the first few months to one year is still fun but afterwards you may need to dedicate your time and a lot more of responsibilities to be done in order for a relationship to work up.     Goodluck!|`|lK3TXGBOaa	OMG i know what you mean!! im just like you! i love romantic movies and i always dream of having like this big adventure with a special guy.Ive always wanted to remember my first kiss and always wanted it to be something special. i just had my first kiss too and i was saving it for somebody special... its the greatest thing to make out with a guy!!! (especially if they have big lips)but i think that you just have to wait..for that guy.. he will come.. i believe that we all have a soul mate. SO dnt worry k. Oh and just because your desperate to know what it feels like ...DOnt Just kiss any random guy cuz you'll regret it.. you have to be in love and feel the butterflies in your stomach.. Maybe going out more and hanging with your friends can hold off that urge to kiss a guy. hope i helped, good luck :)|`|QdXvBOL7aa	its not a "problem" as you see it. Love simply takes time. you cannot expect it to come whenever you want. i waited 2 years without a boyfriend and now i have the love of my life. Patience will reward you honey.|`|lCWIYPLtaa	saving your first kiss is pretty intense but ok.. just get yourself out there in the game go to speed dating or dat nights or join a club or sports group or look around for someone you can really get to know to give this gift you have ready and waiting..|`|bbIUTevlaa	Omg. Hopeless Romantics   The best you can do is just play the field, yknow? Get to know different guys and you never know; one of them might just be the one for you. But don't try searching too hard, he'll find you.   To hold off the urge to kiss a guy? Hm..you can try imagining the guy as someone you don't like? ahha. I'm not sure, but don't worry I've only had one boyfriend and we lasted 5 days max; so it wasn't even worth it. Don't be in a rushhh like I was -__-   The guy's going to come along soon.
b7smO9h1aa	no but i think there's a certain thing when you first see someone really ' hot ' to you that you feel suddenly closer to them but how can you love someone before even talking to them, you don't even know what they are like or there personality. Love at first sight is basing your opinion of love by appearance.|`|gsS0c3yVaa	No but I can attest to an erection at first sight.  She was slutty smoking hot!!!!!!|`|KVd8aKDoaa	No way.  I believe in lust at first sight.  But love at first sight is completely impossible.  You don't know the person, you don't know their personality, how could you possibly be in love with somebody you don't know?|`|el2blDi4aa	noo|`|QTjnxatraa	Well...I met my future husband about 10 years ago and I can still see him coming thru the door at the party I was at.  I was instantly floored and we became good friends as I was with someone else at the time.  Now we have been together for 15 months and he stills floors me...nothing better to fall in love with your best friend...and I believe he had me at first sight.|`|iKUnaAlfaa	yes i do...i can meet someone and love him as i would love myself, for example: a kid is lost and crying at the mall, begging for he's parents...let security know (that's love)...but romance?  dat ain't love at first sight...men and women see each and first sight is all about the physical|`|f8fs6kycaa	Noo..not in real life...Love and true love according to me just happens and you never know also sometimes...
hL3VsoYTaa	It depends on the "chick." Some might think "Hun" is too cutesy, or for married couples.  "Babe" or "baby" are usually both safe bets, and every girl loves being called "Beautiful."   Try mixing it up. "Babe" on a day-to-day basis, "Sweetheart" or "Beautiful" when you're getting romantic.|`|EIAxj0eNaa	Not chicks. Try using her first name instead.|`|dduWesM5aa	definetly not  " chicks".|`|eX8i4vwRaa	beautiful.. always beautiful ?|`|V4VGFyxlaa	Mamas|`|35274e2053698369bf4a9870b0cdac59aa	hot, my bf calls me babe, and I like it.|`|j2cttqpuaa	i absolutely melted when the guy i loved called me baby.  and now my boyfriend calls me babe.  it's cute too.  i love these because it makes me feel in a way protected and at the same time, his.  I, on the other hand, call my boyfriend love because he is older and i feel a bit awkward calling him baby (nonetheless i still do at times).  So just to wrap it up,  babe/baby/love  and some more random ones that i think are cute are  boo (but i think its best not to overuse this one but keep it on the spontaneous side)/my ___ (fill in the blank with anything. her name, baby, whatever! it's just significant that you put "my" in front of it)/ etc!    good luck (:|`|L69jZMXQaa	baby or baby girl:))
8314e0c5ee765b606d480c267bf5f6cbaa	1. Approach him  2. Say 'Hi'  3. Say 'Would you like to get a cup of coffee sometime later'
z3xO2BT2aa	First and foremost for me is personality..........if the guy is not a little weird then it is not worth the conversations. If he has a great personality and is not stuck on himself, that makes him attractive.     Has to love Sci-Fi and weird things, since I am into them as well    Confident and strong but is not a perv. They also need to be very honest and not start with stories to try and impress people, that is a turn off and starts it off with lies. Not good.....    All other things fall into place afterwards when you get to know them.
XpaLyWYOaa	Mmm... fairly similar to what a guy looks for in a girl actually. Any guy with loud, boisterous, obnoxious, machismo, and arrogant qualities isn't very approachable, nor someone I would be compelled to get to know any better.     I would probably be interested in getting to know a guy more if he were calm, easy-going, confident(but not arrogant), good looking, well kept, clean, polite (gentleman), a happy and smiling person.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	Well speaking for myself i don't really have a type of guy i go after just basing on observation, i do however think guys who have great charisma are more approachable
rMq9D06Faa	I think about the last time we talked/spent time together, how I can't wait to see her again, is she thinking about me right now too?|`|08y217Rdaa	Yup, usually it's about the last time and stuff. By the way, girls are the ones who can't get screwing out of their minds. Men think about it when provoked.|`|2zd9OjeMaa	If I like a woman and she's on my mind all day, I mainly think about just hanging out with her, cuddling, stuff like that.|`|lK3TXGBOaa	idk im a girl but i wana see what the guys wrote..interesting question|`|8P6MmLv0aa	I have thoughts of making love to her but also of walking in the woods being romantic with her, and talking to her she great fun to be with, I like to hold her in my arms and just be with her.  Every moment with her is Precious.|`|t5lwrC9Caa	i like to think about driven it so deep that i knock her bladder lose then stand her on her head and do the pile drive...really rock her world is this a good answer?|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	How to not think abut her 24/7.|`|JZsPHstqaa	yea sometimes thoughts of just talking with her or kissing|`|4vv1ElyJaa	Her boobs, her ***, her boobs, her ***, umm doing it with her... maybe what music or sports she likes. Her boobs, ***, boobs... etc    P.S. Meow, girls have sex on their minds 24/7 too. A lot of girls do, I mean.|`|lRemKlvOaa	i usually think how my life would be with them|`|AA10423276	guys don't think the way gals do. guys have sex on their minds 24/7 and they think of sex every 15 seconds. if a gal is on their mind all day, they've either haven't had sex with her yet and he's thinking of ways to get her in the sac. or he's obsessed with her and a psycho. beware!|`|gHHMzAS2aa	her laugh, her smile, the way she talks, the way she makes me feel...    where we might be years from now. and i wont lie, sex too, but not as much as some of you obviously think we do.|`|pa43dGvxaa	how i think of all the possiblities were i can do everything right so that our bond is strong. I always think that i will see her or bump into her and i think about times were we are together in the future having a good time and loving each other. When i really like a girl for who they are i forget more about sex and thats what happens to me. the girl is on my mind 24/7. i want to text her but i dont want to seem like a stalker or i want to see her and i want to be with her|`|eZltpbHeaa	What she may doing at any given time.|`|Ch3uQ3rjaa	Seriously, for me sexual thoughts aren't as prominent. I think about getting to see her and hear her voice and hear her laugh. Granted I think about her boobs and ***, but I spend a lot of time thinking about just being with her and how happy that makes me.    Believe it or not, there are a lot of guys like that...they just don't like to admit it because it's not very macho. Even if they do when they're young, they'll grow up one day and be thinking about the woman...not the sex.|`|cMfiJueXaa	When I'm thinking about a girl 24/7 like I'm doing right now I wonder if she likes me back the same way. Also I think about the last time I spent w/ her. the thing is I don't think about anything sexual w/ her. That is a fact. Plus I think about the next time we will see each other again.
ENWrHP3Raa	Absolutely. We picked a venue that is a state park reducing our venue cost to about 300 dollars, Some have chairs and tables for rent or you can go to a rental company and they run about a dollar per chair for rental. We chose not to do a full dinner and just doing some "appetizers" and snacks. My dress.. Craigslist.. I bought it for 50 dollars.. Amazing gown. Cake... we are going to do a pretty simple "wedding" cake that probably wont serve everyone but we are going to do a giant costco cake and have it cut up and set out with the real 'wedding cake". Napkins and table settings. You can buy a case of napkins from costco for like 20 bux and they are the good dinner napkins you would find at a restraunt. Foam or chinet plate work just as well as some fine china and you can get those at costco too.. For the guys tux we are doing black slacks and then a vest and a nice white shirt rather that the whole enesemble. Drinks... dont do alcahol. thats where you are going to lose alot of your budget. Stick with a simple punch.. We will do sprite and hawian punch mix. Its really tasty. Do you have any friends who like to do hair?? I will ask a bridesmaid to do my hair and that will be her "duty" for the wedding. Simple is in with weddings and hair. Want to get your nails done? Ask your local beauty school how much they charge as to compared to your normal nail salon you can tend to get them 10 dollars or so cheaper and sometimes better quality! Use your venue for both wedding and reception if possible. You will save on transportation for you and your groom and bridal party. Also u can incorporate the decoration from the ceremony to your reception and save money. If you arent super picky silk flowers are the way to go. If you wish to do real flowers my bridesmaids are only carrying a single stem rose with a ribbon tied around it. Flower girls... go with silk flowers because these are going to be stepped on and mangled if they are real. Go simple for centerpieces. We are doing like a small fish bowl with a small tea light. I have heard a cute suggestion doing candy in your centerpieces and that much less you have to haul home. Music... do you have a stereo of your own at home that you could have say like a brother or best man hook up and just do that for music? I think its better than super booming bass and what not. Photographer.. The ceremony is more important than anything and dont skimp. These are your memories... The Reception I would buy 5 or 10 disposable cameras... (i know they have been on sale thru the knot store for liked 3 dollars a piece) and have your attendees take pictures during the reception and then you will have some cute snapshots! Invitations.. we are doing wiltons create your own a box of 50 runs 17-18 dollars at walmart. Rings... we got my engagement ring at Fred Meyer Jeweler for 300 dollars! Its beautiful... Fred meyers also has a trade in with a ring you buy meaning.. I bought mine for 300 in a year or 2 if i want to upgrade I can go in and find something double what i bought it for 600+ and they will give me 300 dollars towards my purchase of my next ring. Limo.. do you neeeeed a limo? We dont... Just use your own car you already have it why not! Keep it simple when you do favors because alot of the times they end up gettin thrown out. Do a small piece of tulle and some candy and a ribbon tied around it. Simple and they will get eatn. You could probably do without a planner too. Just ask your mom your maid of honor and your bridesmaids to help with whatever you need thats what they are there for.. I use theknot.com budgeter and i typed in how much i want my wedding to be and it estimates what I should spend on each catergory... Sorry if this was really long but i really hope it helps!!!!|`|ZxJw85hfaa	well to be honest i think there is no way to cut budget in a wedding...just don't have a wedding.they  are a bit costly and leave debt. for me i got married had a dinner for close family and friends...and instead of having a big wedding i bought me a house. so i guess everyone voices their opinion and thinks differently so i wish you the best on a budget wedding.|`|uFDc66Shaa	hire a band, and not a dj.  bands need exposure, and they'd probably be grateful, and take less of a pay, because they'd be great full just for the chance.|`|JAdNkzENaa	flowers are outrageous these days. if possible get your flowers from a wholesaler and do it yourself. its surprisingly not that hard to do - plus you know what you want =)|`|5WP9rLTlaa	A lot of the really good service providers rely on word of mouth for advertising, ask around your friends and associates if they know of any good priced venues or caterers (one of my friends found a caterer that did three course meals for $13 a head this way!) This is how I got my reception venue- a steal at $150 which is less than half of the going rate for my local area.  Contacting your local council is anther good idea, they will have a list of venues that can be booked for functions and some of these might even be free!  Also you can do it yourself or get an artsy friend to decorate the venue, make your stationary and do the floral arrangments for the bridal party.  Borrowing cars can save you thousands and doing your own hair and makeup is also a good idea|`|RxBe4y3Waa	i did my own flowers. my sister and i made the bouquets and corsages ourselves. we got the flowers at costco, it was inexpensive and fun.|`|oXfvBdNHaa	I don't know how tight your budget is, but I am having a dessert redception, and am calling every single place to get things a bit cheaper.|`|uReFjOONaa	what is your budget?|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Try do as much as possible on your own  My budget was also more or less 10,000  I bought my flowers and made my own "centrepieces" it was cheap and effective  The wedding cake was made by a friend and looked stunning  Hiring alot of the things is cheaper than buying

8emYO8DFaa	Not impossible, just a waste of your time.... You see I am an ex party boy.... From experience, our mindset is this..... Before I get married, I need to get this out of my system. (do you realize how long this can take, especially if he has set goals for himself, ie.... certain amount of girls he wants to sleep with before he settles down) It's gonna take sometime for him to realize that, he should just settle down, because he is headed down an endless spiral.    As for you, I would implore you not to waste your time.... No matter how much you like him, All he is thinking about you is that he must have you on his check list. Especially since you turned him down twice. Even if you do get together with him, there is no guarantee that he will stay faithful. Trust me, no matter how trust worthy a party boy seems, He is out there partying for one reason.|`|93821bdb5da3d5a2f104f4b3594f9053aa	i made party girls good girls.. and good girls into party girls. good luck! hahaha|`|YzhYFu0eaa	You really can't "tame" someone like they're an animal.  The only thing you can do is be up front, tell him that you're only interested in a relationship and not sex, and see where things go from there.  If he's not into that, then move on.|`|chZFmJOPaa	First things first. With dating anyone, you cant expect to change them. One of the worst qualities us women have.... the need to change men haha.  You either accept who they are leave them in the dust.|`|oPEzV2EGaa	girl im in the same situation your in but were dating and all he wants do is ya know.....but i havnt givin it up to anyone yet so all i can say is hang in there and be as sexy as you can be and just make him want to get to know you for you and not just under clothes|`|dNhgIMIPaa	Your doing the right thing! Just keep doing what your doing.  Don't put out for him, because that's what he's wants, So if he's really wanting to be with you, he will ask you out... you could settle him down, but then again, he could be handing you the player card. Don't be fool, I was many times.  I found my man and settled my party boy, but then again I was somewhat a party girl too, I loved to go out with my girlfriends! I didn't bed many guys, just liked to dance and drink! We hung out for 2 weeks before he asked me out and we didn't even kiss till that point! Now we are very low key. lol  If he wants you bad enough he'll ask you out. And even if you two do go out, again be cautious....make him wait a while till your sure ; ) Good luck snagging him!|`|L69jZMXQaa	not really, become a partier too
osQYdJPnaa	The answer is simple.  Give what you can afford.    I just got married in November.  I got anywhere from $30 to $100 from friends and co-workers.|`|wMWfCjBpaa	In the asian culture we only give cash. For a guest $50-$100 would be appropriate.

AA12219091	I don't think you can judge a book by its cover.  A good looking guy could be the most wonderful person ever, or could be a complete a**.  It depends on his personality.  And don't think an unattractive man won't cheat or be a player, sometimes they are even worse.
cUYunFvHaa	well i tried once when i was 16, i drove my mustang off the freeway at 100mph, but i hit a tree after my flight path wasnt what i thought it was gunna be, the guardrail shot me kinda sideway, not into a barrelroll, anyway the tree broke, but decelerated my car enough and made it not land on the roof, i dropped like 30-35 feet off the freeway, 23 south and landed on hillcrest, airbags didnt go off, i woke up in the backseet, shattered 2 vertebre, collapsed sternum, broken ribs, tore a tendon on my leg, and a million cuts, and fiberglass splinters all over my arms, i was lucky    i was pissed at the time and the depression was terrible, not even able to leave it all and ruining the only love u had, my car my freedom, my social reputation as "that kid" now    im 23 now, im healed totally, im stil apathetic twords alot, but generally happy, and i wouldnt do it again,    but if ur sayin ideal way to die........................dunno    i just know not by burning to death, wouldnt want to drown either, maybe gunshots, or maybe in my sleep, i dunno|`|Y4Pr3s7Jaa	This is just the wish but nobody know when and where they die.|`|r2gonS44aa	I don't think anyone 'likes' to die.

618b7a7fb061a6baeaab007ae982e20aaa	i think that in our world today, everyone just befriend you for something that you have or something that they want from you.    real friends are hard to find, there are heaps of ppl out there that will call you their "friends " but seriously deep down, when your in trouble , only a few will come to your aid. keep searching, and when you do come across one, keep em close.    good luck|`|AA11426515	Everyone of us loses loved ones at some point in our lives. We learn to deal with the pain and given time, the pain will lessen but the memories will always remain.    You still have 2 real friends. Treasure them and enjoy your time with them. Some people have tons of fair weather friends but no real friends who can share their thoughts with.     You have a lifetime ahead and you are bound to make friends along the way.|`|AA12029758	i am so sorry for your loss just try to find another real friend and if u wanna anything i will be there for u my friend just contact me honey and always remember good moments u lived with each other|`|J7mSnQPpaa	I am so sorry for your loss, at least you have 2.Visit church sometime, you will make new friends.Try the United Pentecostal Church they are friendly.|`|4d86ab59253d21723e78ab46b486eb25aa	just find some friends  god will give u lot of friends  maybe theres a right time  and u need to wait...  also my friend died b/c   she has a bf and, theyre going  to have a party at night  while her bf is driving...  theyre drinking  while theyre drinking  my friend kissed her bf  then they bumped into another  car...so its not her bf who died  she died b/c she covered the body  of her bf while kissing him|`|8152ccf0cf65faba7e3da55b4e6b173caa	i'm really sorry for your lose...losing ppl you care about is not easy  if you want we can be friends, i love making new friends especially from other countries. so if you're interested email me okay ;)     take care

qLwBd2yfaa	that you're weird|`|CHCPnvksaa	I'd probably be very self conscious and wonder why you're just staring at me. if you included the occassional head nod, or mmm hmm, then that would be ok.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I would imagine you're trying to intimidate me.|`|j5ethbfeaa	Basically be weirded out.

c78mAitdaa	I would seriously say no...    Not until you have the right chance, cause making a move like asking someone out on a date, and being rejected is really painful. Especially when it is in-front of your friends...     You usually feel it when it is the right moment hopefully...     But it is your choice, and it is only and opinion.     :)|`|el2blDi4aa	no|`|Ro4H1kT8aa	go get her from her friends and tell her u need 2 say something too her and tell her u like her and always have and see her reaction...good luck!|`|HGVUSCqVaa	Yes, i believe.|`|3RrD3Rs6aa	yea just ask her out  if she says no...suck it up and take it like a man
x0flaLfUaa	No you're not wrong. But you may have a slightly warped view of how close they were and perhaps the jealousy is colouring it slightly. If they were really that close they wouldn't have stopped seeing her so much. His mother must like you as she's respecting your feelings as is your boyfriend. You need to see if you can find something to help your jealousy, perhaps you need to change the way you see yourself and stop comparing. Your boyfriend loves you.|`|NLxcfGplaa	No your not wrong for feeling like this, did your boyfriend have a problem with her staying their and her relationship with mom?  help his mom out a bit and spend extra time together and your bond will grow|`|r07mkYWHaa	Yes, you are a little wrong. IT IS POSSIBLE FOR SOME ONE TO LOVE OTHER PEOPLE!!!! Face it, he's been in love before and you can't change that, and you shouldn't want to take that away from him. The past is the past and you taking some one out of some one else's life, that you love is wrong. It's called containing your emotions and being confident in who you are and why he is with you. Im sure he and his family has lost some respect for you because of what you are doing. They will appreciate and love you more if you are secure with who you are. You stopping him from seeing her is only breaking the trust he as with you and making him feel like you are trapping him. He is a HUMAN BEING and humans have the right to socialize with other humans.|`|YSbCVt3Uaa	Yeah, that wouldn't sit right with me either. He may not be the guy for you. How a guys family treats you lets you know how serious he is about you.    I dated a guy for 3 1/2 years and every time his parents were in town. His dad would not come to dinner with us. Later on, my ex-boyfriend told me his parents expected him to marry a girl from his hometown; which is not even in the U.S. That was really the last straw. Because when guys talk like that; these momma's boys usually do what is expected of them. Go with your gut, if you don't feel welcomed in his family. Let him go.|`|vtm8lpFDaa	I kind of had a similar situation before. My boyfriend at that time has gone out with the daugther of his family's close friends. They even lived across from eachother. So when it came time for the holidays, we all had dinner together... with his ex gf's entire family. And the girl was Always over at his house with his family, or he's over at the girl's house with her family. I used to think she was drop dead gorgeous too.    What I did to calm myself down is to try to get to like this girl. On the outside anyway. For example, we used to both have hamsters and I used to go up to her and ask her about her hamster and such... just meaningless conversations. I tried so hard to like her. But of course I hated her. But at least his family sees that i'm not some kind of jealous controlling girlfriend and that I'm taking the high road.
c2YcBbXyaa	if you want to date her..... then what's wrong with her thinking the concert is a date?  is it a money issue? is it because everything is expensive at concerts and you don't wanna pay for her drinks etc?  weird|`|08y217Rdaa	Then it's time to get to know her. Make it a date.|`|rSzvXjiqaa	time to make it a date man.|`|Tu7UOK3Waa	one way is to take some of her friends and your friends with (if $ isn't that much of an issue)    but she might know that you are trying to get to know her

I dont think so, he was looking for a clothes showroom, and if he was trying to hit on you, he aborted mission about 75% of the way there.
ec4552cc0681df2ba00b4ddc564a7691aa	Take it for what its worth. You should look into other options as well. you should not have a problem moving on, but know that things like this are special moments that you could look back on.|`|KjkOT5rfaa	If you are truly in love with him you will find a way to make it work.|`|wWi0I37zaa	mmm, well, I think you should forget about that soldier.

I dont think you can do much.|`|L69jZMXQaa	get over him|`|O0pYOOpAaa	get married and go live with him|`|ZxJw85hfaa	well you have to sacrifice for love, so if you love your man you join him for good.If i were you i would move with him to the states.|`|YlQcy0Xzaa	Tell it to him... reciporcate|`|b82ybE3gaa	It depends on how much he feels for you, and Military men either love whole heartily or know they can't get attached. Its usually either or, I'm dating a Marine now, and have pretty much only dated marines since i started dating (not on purpose I just seem to only be interested in them even ones that I don't know are military) so i kinda got experience.    And are you willing to move for him?? Is it that serious? Would you both like it to be? these are all questions you HAVE to talk with him before he leaves, its only feb, but July isn't that far away.|`|y76xRnbtaa	Dont' be sad baby,true love never fails the one who worship it.Wait for him to come back,if you put faith,he will surely come back.pray for his success and wish him all the best.He will surely appreciate your love and loyalty,after all he will fight for the country.|`|n0cJVKYEaa	do you believe in destiny? well if you do, then you met by destiny...so leave it to your destiny coz true love would always find a way out. trust me on that one.|`|6c4D4Ereaa	see if he wants you to move back with him?|`|tGBTrq0eaa	i dont know...take a part of him..have it..se*|`|LPKHGAgEaa	Well..

Could you still leave your home to live here permanently? The best answer you`ll get is from your folks, who have your best interests at heart. Take their advise instead of that of strangers who don`t know you. Lots of luck, you`re going to need it.|`|269a22963227ace39bc99fecd062b0d5aa	If you truly love him .. you should go with him. Otherwise, you will wonder for the rest of your life ... what if?|`|GMA3pDCGaa	My question, once more, is, are you in LOVE or in Lust (Heat).  Because if is the first choice, i'd say, married the guy, star a house, kids, a dog , a cat, and so on' if is the second one; is for sure that he will be recall up to action pretty soon , so I would have to say  tell you to use your time with him wisely.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	You may be pleasantly surprised with a marriage proposal & I will say it will happen in the early summer.|`|N1qKXDs2aa	move to the states. we'd love ti have you, and its warmer over here anyway    but you will miss out on the sun being up at 9pm during the summer.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I think that what you should do depends on your current relationship with him.|`|e7I0PXBNaa	thats a tough situation. For now enjoy his company and pray for the best. BTW does he feel the same way?|`|cSOpcKOWaa	How does he feel about you? If he loves you as you love him then he will welcome you to go with him. Keep in mind though, moving away from family and friends is a very lonely road. You must be able to handle separation. It is a very depressing thing to cope with if you aren't that good at separation. I am from the USA, and I had severe separation anxiety during holidays for a long time before I became used to being here in Australia. So, for your sake you should weigh it out.. I hope he loves you as much as you love him.|`|ec55348158c3fd8764f5daba79c0af3daa	How does he feel about you?  If he is in love with you the two of you will find a way.  If he isn't then there is nothing you can do that will help things.    You are young.  If this isn't meant to be you will have plenty of other opportunities to fall in love with other good people.    Just don't ever give up on yourself.
OxnFnyqPaa	First of all sorry about the way she broke up with you.  That was really a very improper way of breaking up with someone, but it happens.  I guess she felt the same way but then something came up that she had to break up with you.  Don't worry I know you love her and all and she probably likes you to death as well. But maybe something really happened, like her parents found out and she couldn't tell you the reason.    Just give her space and don't bother her.  If she comes back then she's yours but if she doesn't then you have to let her go even if she means the world to you.     Good luck and hope this helps! ^__^
6GB5P7ojaa	Of course it is. That's really unselfish and thoughtful. She has to mean a lot to you for you to give her something as special as that.    There's really nothing wrong with putting something precious in an urn.|`|P4Jc76GPaa	The question is how much does your husband cherish the necklace. You should have let him know what your intentions were. with that said, it sounds like it was a great idea. it's something that you cherish, just like your friendship with her. I think it was the right thing to do. My condolences for your loss.|`|aqsUNGfEaa	Why not? It's fitting that it's a cross too.|`|ivPHFhWvaa	what is a hub? Does g/f stand for girlfriend or good friend?|`|KKPsTOXgaa	if that was once of your greatest friends, and she meant a lot to you, then why are you regretting your decision?    worrying about this is worthless since you can't do anything.  if she meant that much to you then she deserves something valuable to you.     so yes it was a OK thing to do.|`|nyeUUojFaa	i think its a very nice thing to do.|`|5WB2yZUFaa	That is so sweet. you're a great friend, and so thoughtful! she was lucky to have you! i'm sorry for your loss.
59CaFeS8aa	Attraction over good looks is one thing. But there are many other factors that make you beautiful.    IT COULD BE  THE SMILE, THE POSTURE, THE WAY YOU TALK, LOOK, MAKE OTHERS COMFORTABLE, THE COZINESS, THE STRAIGHTFORWARDNESS, THE COMFORT YOU RADIATE AROUND.    Look inward and find out these factors in you.    Get close ans cozy with your hubby. He shud not be ur hubby just fir ur looks and money. He shud have other factors bonding to you.    He shud not be worrying abt your wrinkles or marks.    Rahther those marks can be something that add to the kick in the bed.    Just make it ur USP for a good work out in bed.    Just dont worry abt the marks,.    Enjoy ur life.    U are lucky , good looking and have lots of frnds around.    Good wishes.    Lets know after a few months or yeras after ur marriage,|`|PsBKkj5Faa	Hi! i m amarjeet . and i know the problem u had written in mail it is serious problem any girl who are going to marry .but i have solution to you about that stretch, just use lacto calamine lotion or eraser or erytop lotion at every nigth before to go sleep .this lotion is mostly available on every medical store .I hope you will get satisfact result as soon as possible.and you will be good and relax against you problem. good luck and i wish u a very happy married life and i pray to god that's ur husband did not get any chance to go any other women because i know that u r be so beautiful .|`|5nfqY9T7aa	First off, if you guys are in love, the guy isn't going to care that much about some stretch marks.    That said, try cocoa/shea butter.  And/or look around the lotion section for products specifically to minimize stretch marks.  They shouldn't be too costly.
HDyqzvUkaa	I am 21 now and i had a falling out with my parents at 18, when i stopped speaking with them so I could punish them and show them how much they'd miss me, to foolishly prove that they should have treated me better.  I don't not mean to say "I've been in your worn shoes, lemme tell ya".  It is quite common for you to seek your own independence.  Most everyone goes through a "rocky" period where they are trying to be respected as a adults yet their parents still treat them as children.    I can also understand how it is humiliating to be treated as lesser than your twin sister.  She is your peer and should be given equal responsibility, and it is an obvious shame that you have to be submission to a peer.  Regardless of whether they don't feel you can be trusted this is a shameful tactic to be employed by your parents.  Honestly i don't think they realize how mind-******* it is to have to bow down to your former equal.  Everytime you do this your brain relates it as negative status in your family-tribe.   You should definitely talk about it with the one you are more comfortable with.  Don't bring it up during a fight because it will lose most of its power, as it will be brushed of as thoughts of rage.  Bring it up in a very serious, this is where things stand conversation.  Don't attack, trust me don't attack.  Your best tactic is never to attack, their weapons are better and more expensive.  At best you want them to empathize with you so they can "see where your coming from" and this can't be accomplished if their busy thinking about themselves, and how you made them angry.           Before you decide to say "**** ya'll i'm rollin' out" consider these two thoughts:  1) You will eventually have to mend whatever damage is done, it won't just go away and neither will your family.  You will know them until they die.   2) Living on your own is tough **** without parents. At 18 i imagine you don't have a degree or any experience in a paid skill.    When you rebelled and bought that laptop, that car, how do you think you were able to afford it? Even if you slaved to earn the money to pay for it, you still didn't have to spend your hard-earn money on rent, food, electricity, children.  Think about   Think about how much you earn on your own compared to how much you consume.  This should give you a good grounding for where your parents stand with you.      Still you need to talk with them and remind them that you feel pushed away.    All in all, respect them and they will respect you.  Kind words are generally harder for men than women (that's probably a big reason why your sister is given more respect)|`|eMFYNGI2aa	I wasn't the best behaved teen i can admit that, I'm 17 now and married, but have been on my own since I was 15.  My mom and I have no relationship at all... my dad's cool, but he acts younger than I do.  Will Smith said it best, parents just don't understand.  Some parents I've noticed get on this authority kick and abuse their power, I'm not going to say that your parents aren't necessarily doing what's best for you and trying to protect you, but that's ridiculous, parents need to have boundaries just like kids do.|`|0cCV9Litaa	Everyone has parent issues as a teenager, it's part of the ride. You'll grow out of it soon.|`|AA11420742	I'm only 14 and I'm not exactly in your position. My Mom trusts me too much and I hate it because it makes me feel like I can't do anything wrong if I do then it would be horrible, I've always asked her if she trusts me and she always says yes and if I pretend to do something wrong they don't believe me, I broke my mom's old glass and didn't get in trouble for some reason I want to know what it feels like to get in trouble. My mom never grounds me and I feel that's worse then always being grounded. I feel bad for you I truly do just explain to them you deserve they're trust and if they don't want to give it to you because of something that happened a long time ago then you don't feel it's right to stay there and if they don't start making you feel trusted you'll never call them again or something maybe that will show them. Even explain to them you feel 2nd best in the house I used to go through the whole favorites game when I was little my mom always loved my sister more until she made huge mistakes now I feel equally loved sometimes even more loved which of course I feel bad for my sister but still. If you don't want to do it in person then leave a note or something when you leave that way it gives them time to think and they can contact you when they are ready to talk or explain. I hope I helped. I hope things get better for you and your family issues. If you ever want to talk contact me. =)|`|LWpUjTHmaa	My relationship with my parents are horrible, my dad never trust me on anything. A month before my high school graduation the school sent us a mail saying I lost one of their books and I won't be able to graduate unless I pay the fee, I've never even borrowed such a book from the first place, I told my dad it was a mistake from the bookstore but he didn't believe me and just took money out of my bank and paid for it. Afterwards I went to the school to find out why it was marked as a lost book under my name and the book keeper somehow find the "lost book" in the back of the book room. I told my dad that it was a mistake and the school is giving me my money back and he didn't even apologize to me. Every since then I told myself that there's no reason for their trust, I don't care about them anymore, in fact my feelings for them points toward the negative side. I started doing everything myself and I never tell them anything.  And as for people who say your parents cares about you blah blah blah, you should treat people the way you want to be treated. That is just full of bullshit. People are selfish, greedy, glutton,people kill people, people are the source of hatred in this world. It doesn't matter how you treat them, they'll always treat you the way they want to, parents are no different.|`|AwAw0uiKaa	I have this same things with my parents, and I am 21. My personal view is that if parents are going to be that hard-a$$ about trust to the extent of house arrest, it's not worth trying. I swear my parents love the "control" of it because they've never truly been able to control my decisions, so I just don't give them the satisfaction. It's been getting better since I pretty much went on my own.|`|rSzvXjiqaa	Hi,  It seems to me that your parents lost their trust in you a long time ago, and it wouldnt have taken so long for you to gain it back, but you werent willing.  My friends parent lost their trust in her, and even though she didnt try to gain it back for awhile, she realized that she will never get it back if she doesnt try.  So she sat down with them and they talked about the things she did that made then lose their trust.    She fixed it and now they are ok.    Try to earn their trust, there is no point in acting like it doesnt matter to you, because obviously it does.    Talk to them, be slightly more respectful and they wil respnd in the same way.  Good luck! =]|`|yJQpxV75aa	Mine were murdered when I was 4, so I don't know.|`|2XTkSV4daa	Hey Cory!    Yes, teens all over the world feel that way (if not that extreme for some). I suggest you can do a few things...(1) do stuff to regain their trust (2) I know this is going to sound hard, but treat them as you want to be treated...this will make them realize you are more mature and (3) apologize for stuff in the past. I know it sounds hard but it will help you have a better relationship with them and also be able to get more privledges.|`|kLPaq30Eaa	Geez, your parents have taken things a little far. When I was younger, I got into trouble just like you by lying, not hanging out with the best friends... among various other things that are too shameful to say. But I'm 18 now and my parents have completely forgiven me for everything. We've had a close relationship for the past couple of years. If I were you, I would continue doing the same as you are doing. Move out and do your own thing. They're holding a grudge against you for things you did as a teenager. Teenagers do stupid things. Good luck =]|`|wlOUQIRjaa	The way you described it, nothing sounds too abnormal. Many (most?) teenagers have some tension with their parents in the years before they move on. (I sure did)    Hang in there, things get better. Being a teenager sucks for everyone.

As far as the half hour lunch goes, I'd rather have a half hour, a one hour lunch is too long.

As for switching to a job you would like better, make sure you get into a field that is more secure, like healthcare.  And mind you, you don't have to take care of patients to be employed in the healthcare field.    As for your boss, have you tried talking to him?  Sometimes it works to have a heart-to-heart with somebody and tell them exactly how you feel (with tact, of course)
5WB2yZUFaa	I don't know if there is anything you can do. i had a lot of guy friends when i met my husband and he wasn't comfortable with it, so as he became more important to me than they did, i stopped being friends with them out of respect for him. i'm 22 and we've been married 4 years. some guys are just the jealous type and it sounds like your one of those guys. and that's ok as long as you aren't trying to control her every move. there are very few guys that are friends with a girl just because they enjoy her company. guys almost always want more. you're a guy, think about it. if he's going over there everyday, he wants more than her friendship. i think you're right to be jealous. ask her how she would feel if you had a girl over everyday. if she cares about you as much as you think she does, she won't have a problem spending a little less time with this guy. good luck.

I am British and have never heard of anyone do this. Its not a typically British thing, so don't go blaming groups of people. Seek some advice and I hope something good comes of this for you.|`|kzkrll3Xaa	sorry to hear of your loss next time be more careful who you marry. u will probably see ur children when they are older. otherwise seriously think twice before you get married, at least sign a prenuptual agreement and use contraception until u know ur wife isnt a cow.|`|a7364c50b7e6712ee3c77218a3232b45aa	I really feel for you - divorce/separation across borders always seems to result in turmoil when there are children involved.  From your wife's point of view she is probably afraid of the children not being allowed back from USA, and her limited rights if they were born there.    Often it is the woman who loses her children in this way to countries unsympathetic to "outsiders", particularly the ones where fathers have automatic custody because of the lesser position of women.  In Western countries the mother seems to have favour though I'm surprised the UK courts were so unsympathetic to you.    Have you approached any support groups such as the US version of Fathers For Justice?  They might have experience of a similar situation.    I hope you get some contact with our children as they as well as you are losing out.  Have you tried emailing your wife (or children)?  The written word can be more controlled compared to phone conversations where emotions can get heated.
bbIUTevlaa	That's really up to you. If I loved someone I wouldn't put them down or hold them back from their own personal life. It seems to me she's a bit too controlling. Try talking to her about it. Her control over you is probably because she does love you. She just doesn't realize what it does to you.|`|yMyJ9Y6Aaa	She says she loves you but her actions speak differently.  How long before you stop believing what she says and see how she reall treats you?|`|QSxdmwAjaa	She may really love you, but not enough to stop. If you know that she's done this before, she'll probably do it again. I  think the question you need to ask yourself is whether or not the good things about your relationship over power these lash outs.  But it's not okay for her to be doing that, and I think it's good you told her you wanted to take a break because it will help to send her that message. She needs to understand that she's hurting you and that if she  wants to be with you, she needs to learn to control her feelings.   You should probably also consider what causes her to do this and try to help her in the future (if you stay with her) before it gets to that point.  Talk about whatever the problem is and try to reach an agreement before she has a chance to get really angry (if it's possible....... sadly, it's often not). Good luck!|`|Tu7UOK3Waa	I think a break would make things worse bc she would be confused, you should tough through it because then she will know how much you love her, you guys should talk about your needs because she obviously doesn't know what the lines are and she seems a bit insecure and controlling|`|AA11692457	Just depends on how much love you have for her, if it is limitless, if I were you, I would suck it up. Be easy going about it, try not to get too emotional.
OTT79NAtaa	Would a girl go up to a guy while they were with a girl? - I think this answer would be similar.|`|gRsuXxkbaa	idiots do stuff like that|`|HGVUSCqVaa	Yes i believe so.
9C95aiM4aa	Well the main problem is you...you're the biggest piece of monkey trailer trash walking god's green earth. You will eventually drop out of college because you will realize you're nothing but a piece of ****. When I take a **** and look in the toilet, I think of you. Hopefully your dad shoves his boot right up your *** when he sees you. You ******* asshole.|`|knNzAv2Kaa	It is okay how u feel but please understand that ur father is a person too.  In life, we all make mistakes and all do things that may not have been using foresight.  However,  please look at the bigger picture and think of how many people don't have the oppurtunity to even know who there dad is etc.  Yes, we cannot make up for lost time but u can be the better person and start a relationship slowly on ur terms.  Even if its just saying hi dad have a good day.  then moving to dad I just want to let u know how i feel...to seeing him as a person.   My dad was not perfect and I don't expect him to be.  I see him for who he is and am grateful for knowing that he is alive and doing better these days.  Know which battles to fight and which battles to reconcile.  Life is too short and ur wasting so much time being mad when u could actually use that energy to find ways to  have him now be part of ur life.  Think about it before it's too late.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	How does he try to manipulate you into being something you're not?  Don't take his calls anymore.  It is not good for your mental health or well being.|`|rSzvXjiqaa	I think that i agree - u have every right to hate him.  A father is someone who comes home and notices right away that something is wrong.    A father is someone who cares for the very thing he helped to bring into this world (i.e. - you)  A father is someone who loves and respects other people.  This is only a couple of things that a father is.  If he is none of those and more, than u have full right to hate him, even though it might hurt u to do so.  Have you ever tried talking about these feelings towards him?    Good luck! =]|`|GyG0g6rOaa	yes u do. a father doesnt have to be blood     a father is a person in your life who loves u and is there to give you advice and give support     hes not doin n e of those     so hes family but u dont need to like them|`|AA11420742	I sort of know how you feel. no matter how much you sometimes don't want to admit it your dad is your dad if you want him to be or not he might not be the guy who was there when you were sick or the guy who helped you learn how to drive or even was there for your first disney world vacation! but he is still a part of your life. some people choose to not contact the guy or whatever but I believe give him a chance,I just think you should talk to him and tell him how you feel it will be very very difficult im sure but chances are you'll feel better in the end it will hurt to tell him your true emotions but love can be painful hopefully afterward he'll understand and maybe even have a way to fix it and make it better. hope i helped|`|JqKBkP4vaa	You do have the right but can you live with it? I hated my dad for a long time b/c of past experiences(and him being EXTREMELY strict) that hurt me but he was always there. My mom understood and just always reminded me that even though things were bad he was still there. She grew up w/o her father. They had an argument when she was 18 and didn't talk for yrs. She forgave him but not until I was about 8 or 9. I have also come to accept my father as i have gotten older( and so has he). He is who he is. I cant change that. I can only change me. My dad now is somewhat more understanding and easier to talk to. I'm not saying your dad will ever change but really think on what you can live with. If its never speaking to him again,then you have your answer but if not.....   Any change in both parties will not happen overnight.
yptHq9gEaa	Please call a suicide hotline right this second!  This is a national suicide hotline number 1-800-273 TALK     You do have another choice.  Your brother will always be with you, especially because he was your twin.  And he would never blame you for what happened and you know it.  Please get some help right away.|`|oUDDsVu5aa	Amber sweet heart please hear this I know how you feel I have had to bury both of my brothers I am the youngest of three I felt the very same way you do right now it sux I know it hurts like h*ll I know but the only way I was able to beat it was first know that god is in control second you Destiny is determined before you are ever conceived god has planed out every part of your life including your death before you ever conceived the good and the bad you have to give this pain to god that is the only way it will never go completely away because of the strong love you have for him it has never gone away for me but it has become much easier each day that i remember how bad it hurt and thought how bad it would hurt though who love me here if I was to go my self and how they would feel if I stopped living because they died before me how bad that would hurt them.  live your life in honor of him put his mark on this world for him in his memory and honor of the love you shared don't tarnish the love he has for you with the sting of death this is not what he would want you to do he loves you you love him that is obvious would you want him to hurt his self if it had happen to you? I think not would it totally break your heart to see him suffer as you are and would you cry out NO don't do it if you seen him trying to harm his self to be with you if you had passed before him? Please just think about what I have said here I know you are mad at god right now I know I was for a while but I see now that death to us here is birth to ever lasting life with god there.  this will not be easy to overcome I know but you can do it with the help of the love and memory of your brother and knowing with you he will live on in your heart andd your memory and with the help of god you will make it and go on to do great things in this world in his honor and his name putting his mark on this world so that he and his life here is never forgotten.  I really hope this helps and you think long and hard about this and I pray that god will give you the peace that he has blessed me with in my time of great need and that he will bless you in all that you do|`|sCGWcJTFaa	move on, he doesn't want to see you hurt and you both know that it's an accident anyway. So why hurt yourself when he already forgives you? Do you think he'll be happy to see you kill yourself just to see him? Of course not, he wants you to be happy. So get up on your knees and keep moving while keeping him in your heart. I'm sorry to hear about that and I know it hurts, but just can't do anything about it anymore.|`|odacqJuEaa	Death isnt the answer in these situations, you know that your brother loves you and im sure that hes watching down seeing you cry is making him cry he doesnt wanna see you in pain.    i know how it feels and it isnt a great feeling, im sorry you had to do this.   if u need someone to talk to ill gladly be here for you.
rSzvXjiqaa	honey, please dont do something that everyone will regret.  Im sorry about what happened to your brother; i know these things are hard to get over.  You need to stay strong, would your brother want you to do this to yourself?    Try to talk to someone about your feelings, maybe your parents, or a best friend, or anyone who you feel you can totally trust.    Trust me on this, you wont be helping anyone to destroy yourself like this.  You need to calm down and relax, as sad as it is, the accident happened and you need to slow down and see what options you have to help, instead of destroy.  My friend had a twin who was in an accident wiht he and he died and she didnt.  she beat herself up over it for months, and then instead of letting herslef go, she wanted to be an example for others.  She started volunteering at high schools telling her story and about safe driving and the outcome of not being safe.  she feels a lot better now.  Try to stay strong, itll be ok..  Good luck! =]|`|jYMlAN4Paa	This isn't something you can do alone. You need to see a counselor trained in grief and loss. You could even go to a church for help (and you don't have to be religious to get help). There are clinics and hospitals even have grief counselors or ways to find one for you. You need to talk to someone. Dealing with this by yourself is not the way.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	Suicide is the one sin that is not forgiven, so if you want to see him again, let God decide when it's your time.     Sorry about your brother. Grief is very hard, there's no easy way to overcome it. Time does make it a little easier to deal with, but it's always there.     You should talk to a church person, dr. or call an 800 suicide hotline. Pray, talk to God, let Him help you through this.|`|QFf9phAmaa	it is GOD will. time will come when be happy. may god bless you peace.|`|QONFn7vXaa	Well hun, think about what he would want you to do?  My sister was a driver in a car wreck that killed her best friend, I don't know how you feel but I've seen the pain.  I'm very sorry that your going through this.  If the roles were reversed what would you want.  I know that I would want my sister to focus on living, find ways to make my life help someone else.  What was Jadons favorite thing?  Why not do something in his honor?  Help people remember him by the good things.  Even starting a funding for something he would have loved that could be named after him.  Maybe a skate park that you could help fund?  I don't know what he loved but you do, and if you go away you can't ever help people know him.  I'm sure your hurting now more than you'll ever hurt, but doing something to put your feelings into can help that.  Seek someone who loved him that you can talk to, especially if you have a church, getting close to God will get you closer to Jadon while your still living.  I'll be praying for you.|`|ZNCGui3eaa	I am sorry this happened. As you said, it was an accident, nobody knows when our time comes for us to live this world. But remember that each one of us have a purpose in this world, find yours. If you believe, you can understand that after death there is haven and that is our end from this world. So reach and prepare yourself to be in haven where we all deserve to be. Give your sorrows and worries to the God you believe and ask for guidance.|`|0cCV9Litaa	I've been going through something like this for the past few years.

Go to sleep and when you wake up tomorrow do something about this.|`|gKwKxJyNaa	Amber sweetie, just please think about your brother, think how he would want you to live your life and enjoy it, live your life for your brother, make your happiness his happinnes, don't end it, enjoy life for your brother. Remember him and love him, don't forget him but don't end it, life is precious and i'm sure your brother would want you to live it to the fullest.    You should really try talking to your family and getting professional help, it will help you so much I hope the best for you.|`|QPPcUyyyaa	Please call this phone number immediately:    1-800-273-TALK    Please.

Killing yourself is never a good option. Think of all the people who would be heartbroken if you hurt yourself. Think of everything you'd be giving up.  Family, love, children, success, happiness.      It may seem dark now but don't give up and please seek help.     Try calling the suicide prevention hotline at this website. Don't give up on yourself    http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org...|`|yptHq9gEaa	Think about all the other people who are mourning the loss of your brother.  Can you imagine how much more pain you'll be inflicting on them if you do this to yourself?  Especially when they find out it was done on purpose!  If you don't value your life without your brother enough to not go through with this, then please let your love for the rest of your family and friends be the reason to keep going.  Otherwise, you will be putting them through the same thing you are going through right now.|`|odacqJuEaa	i emailed you check it im here for you if you need someone to talk to.    i know what your going through believe me this pain hurts and it just doesnt go away,    There is no cure for a broken heart only things to coat the pain you need a friend, someone to actually be there for you, i hope someones there for you.
aXOyK3uBaa	NOTHING about a woman's dating profile "turns me ON".   Not even the pictures.     Her profile exists to generate attention to herself. And you definitely don't want to communicate that you are "turned on" by her carefully chosen REHEARSED and CALCULATED words. The only thing a profile should acomplish is whether or not you want to MEET her.    She can work on being a turn-on at THAT time.  ????    What turns me OFF?   Now that's where it gets interesting.    With a female dating profile you have to "read between the lines".    Many American women are so boring , uninteresting, and have nothing to say that they actually think listing favorite TV shows - and favorite music - is what makes her have a "personality".    ? "I like going out for dinner"    Yeah so does everyone else. Are you buying??    ? "I want a man who KNOWS how to treat me like a lady"    And what if you don't know how to BEHAVE like one??    ? "I want to meet my Prince. He should treat me like this. He should treat me like that. He would look like this. He should act like that. He would dress like this. He would tell me exactly what I want to hear...... and he should never want "THAT".    Really?  Wow!!! that's alot of hoops to jump through, lady. Even before the first cup of coffee. I think I just lost 20 pounds. Should your happiness be my CARDIO??  No thanks.    You should really get a puppy dog for that.    NEXT.    If you REALLY PAY ATTENTION to women's dating profiles..... they go on and on and on and on about what you can do for THEM. They almost NEVER talk about what's in it for the guy. And these are women who are looking for men to LOVE and CARE about them???    Please.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	ive never been to one but heres what i think    Turn Offs: them telling there life storys..i mean every single detail about their life|`|chZFmJOPaa	I dont like when guys come out and say "I go to the bar a lot" or "I watch sports." for hobbies.

If I know from the start that they're gold diggers it's a turn off.  I don't want a princess that I have to take care of and groom.  As for turn ons, someone who's down to earth and doesn't take huge priority in the material aspects.
4T9fZzITaa	yes you can. you can tell him some girls don't bleed. cuz its true!
Jh0yyYizaa	I wear glasses and nobody ever teases me about it,  I think every girl looks smart and sophisticated with glasses.     Don't be worried about some boy. He just hasn't grown up yet.   Wear your glasses with confidence and don't even look his way.   If he looks at you and teases you, ignore him and go on to talk to someone else or simply just walk away.

Um... "hello. I like you. tralala"|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Don't confess.    Guys would rather not know.    If he knows you are not exclusive, what does that say about your relationship?

4T9fZzITaa	hec yes. i am a virgin & it'd be awesome to marry a man who is a virgin.  when it starts to get serious is when you should let em know.. and how  well ask em how they would feel about it and what their input about it is  just talk about it..   and im soo glad to see that even thru some ppls dumb & unneccessary negativity you don't let it faze you.|`|AA11313204	that would suck. no thanks|`|QtaPF83iaa	I kinda wish I did.  I was a virgin, so didn't have much experience and am still experiencing new things in sex.  Unfortuneately sometimes he gets bored and I wish I could share the enthusiasm with him.

Just bring up a conversation of morals.|`|chZFmJOPaa	Well thats a tough one. Specially if the other person isnt a virgin still. I think I would wait until kissing starts leading to other things.

Today... I'm not very sure on that!|`|zAT1nrcyaa	When my boyfriend told me that he wanted to wait..i was really glad.  People have different opinions through, i'm sure you will find a girl that would be happy to be with you and  wants to wait also.|`|5620d16d0782c9b2d509fdb5252b9d1daa	Definitly No!!!    For a man to be sexual experienced he needs YEARS and a LOT OF PRACTICE ...and most women are seduce by experienced men in bed.    women body is too complicated, you need to know what you are doing, is hard to make a woman have an orgasm even when  you are experienced ..can you imagine if you don't even know what you are doing?? ...the only possiblitly you got is to marry a virgen as then she won't notice your lack of expertise and you wont' lose when a woman compares you to an experienced and great man in bed...    Also you can not say you will only love your wife, how do you know that? as far as everybody is concern all men and women say that when they get married...and look at the divorce rate!!      you sound very inmature and full of fantasies about love, marriage and sex, and is nice but is not practical,..you are extremly naive.    marriage is something else, even love is not enought, is more about understanding one another, compatibility, respect, similar backgrounds, morals and goals, and ability to tolerate and forgive a lot of things..  anyway, I wish you luck but i really believe you waste a lot of time for not having sex earlier, is not just bad for you..but poor of the woman that will have to teach you (not many probabilities you will find a virgen women these days..and if you do, you won't have many to choose from!!)|`|KILFoc6kaa	Yes there are girls that do. I did, and I was also a virgin, we had our personal reasons for doing so, and wanting that.There are still plenty of people today that choose to wait for marriage, and if its something you are wanting to do, then the girl you are meant to marry will understand and honor that.  I think that in a relationship you can feel when it has come to a point where you need to discuss this naturally.      To the people that think that men need some kind of training in sex it simply isnt true.  My husband and I were both virgins as I said and we have enjoyed the experience of learning new things together, never once did I feel  lack of experience hindered our intimate life at all, quite the opposite I think it has enhanced in speaking to some of my friends who have made other choices.    I personally think its a choice each person has to make for themselves. I have no quarrel with people whom choose to have sex before marriage, that's fine and something they chose.  What I have a problem with is people that assume that waiting makes you less able to please each other.      If you want to wait, the person you are meant to be with will be the one that respects your choice, without fail, without fuss and without question.

chZFmJOPaa	Thats normal. Sometimes its the only questions you should ask is if he has ever been with a guy. Thats the best question to ask lol. You'd be surprised.     Think of it this way, he didnt know he was going to meet you. He didnt know how long it was going to be before he found the girl he wanted, if it ever would happen.  It did and hes with you. Just think of that. Youre the best thing that has happened to him in his opinion. He wouldnt be marrying you if you werent.|`|GRuIq6Igaa	Ok, is he still seeing these women?  Is he having inappropiate relationships with them?  IF the answer is NO then why does it bother you now?  You have been married to him for a year.  Trust him and enjoy your life together.  He dated those women in the PAST.  Leave it back there.  If you are jealous all the time, you will spoil your relationship with the distrust and hurt.  Is it worth it?    If he is seeing them NOW, then get out of the relationship.  If he isn't willing to change, then why should you put up with it?  If he loves you, he is only with you and no other women.    If it REALLY bothers you, then get marriage counseling for both of you so you two can have a healthy marriage.|`|AA11178855	HAPPY ANNIVERSARY BABY!  Are u happy?  If you are?

Ask him to come clean about all of them and if you think you can't deal with knowing all of this, end it.  However, smartest thing to do (after talking to him about it) is to get pre-marriage counseling before you get married.  If he won't go or if you don't complete the suggested   of sessions, don't marry the dude!    I asked my hubby about his past while we were dating and BEFORE we were engaged.  We were open about it all.|`|GuK9yLGJaa	i wouldnt worry about it if you dont suspect him of cheating his ex is exactly that his ex and the fact that they were off and on should tell you that it didnt work for them for a reason and if he has a brain he wont screw up and ruin his marrage|`|AA11313204	i didnt ask because i already knew. i think if it is something you are concerned about you should find out ahead of time. the important thing is the future not the past. try to let it go. be glad you won him over. you must have something special they didnt have
1dQsvw2kaa	never fear, if he WAS using you he would just deny it smoothly and carry on scabbing answers.    i think you have yourself a nice sensitive dude, just give him sum space, then start again, like just small things first  etc, and it will be faster this time, i promise, and POOF back to normal, just know now hese sensitive, and make your "sarcastic" comments a little more obvious. :P|`|N1qKXDs2aa	i think he is hurt, especially since he's avoiding you and forfeiting free history answers|`|bec16h7Taa	Approach him. Talk to him. Its impossible for us to tell you how he feels without seeing it happen. But it sounded like he was interested in you. Just be like "Hey...did I do something to make you mad at me?"
Wy47JwOQaa	Well, I wanted to write you a list of possible options, but your question asked for a single question, so I tried to narrow it down to one for you.  Here it is:    "What question(s) could I ask you that would scare you?"|`|dgoZCrt0aa	Ask him if cares about you. 3 months I say is not enough to ask do you love me. If he says he cares about you and shows it to you right away it means your relationship is going great. If he says No tell him good because your seeing someone else and break up wit him.|`|08y217Rdaa	Ask him if he's tired of waiting
XH2o1MM6aa	.Seems to me your sister is the fly in ointment.Just deal with him without even considering the other issue.It's you and him.Nothing else matters|`|el2blDi4aa	aaahhh
2FA9qNHzaa	When all else fails, ask about the other person, their interests, hobbies, favorite TV show, anything so you can listen and they talk.   Your accent is foreign, but I bet it's more interesting than a laughing stock. Give it time, and listen to people. It is a lost art.|`|6bKws0fAaa	thing is   when you become you and stop trying to impress other people  people will accept you and respect you more cause they see your not fake or just trying to fit in  and if they don't like you, you just keep being yourself  but still try to enjoy life :]|`|dzDWmq9Paa	http://i278.photobucket.com/albums/kk111...|`|ExSTxiBWaa	I used to be the exact same way! I found that the more I just forced myself to talk to people, the more comfortable I got, and then the more people liked to talk to me. Confidence has a lot to do with being able to chit chat with people and make friends, and the only way to build up your confidence is to practice. So just try and do it as much as you can, even if its really hard right now, and one of these days you'll find yourself striking up a conversation without even giving it a second thought :]|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	Your english seems fab. Some people are just mean, and not everyone likes to talk about class related topics, try talking to them about things you like. And if that still doesn't work just work on the friendships that you have, after all they are the ones that matter. I understand how  you feel, being in college and not making many friends is hard too. Never feel that way about yourself again, i'm sure you're a joy to your parents and mean very much to them and your friends. You have every right to be there as the next person.|`|HI5aBVYgaa	Be yourself and stay away from peer pressure or teen cliques cause tho suk im in the 11 grade and i've learned that in high school you never really know who your friends are so just be yourself and dont try too hard to fit in. You'll settle soon.|`|2Pv7OlcTaa	that happened to me too...but i pushed myself and became outgoing  and now i have a whole lunch table filled with good friends that always wanna sit by me =]|`|DBoxelmlaa	yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa|`|Heux22X5aa	I've always been kinda shy and quiet myself. It's tough getting used to people sometimes, though being quiet usually pays off. You don't get into trouble that much, so that's a plus. Maybe join a club that you are interested in.|`|eMFRN0HCaa	Find a way to stand out. Cheerleader, talent show, sports, awards boyfriend,  prom queen. Don't try to hard. Just be yourself, and girls with accents are hot, so don't be hard on yourself.|`|ykCZfC3laa	I know exactly how you feel, ive been through the same thing, this may not be the exact answer to your question but its what i have lernt.  People that make fun of your accent is either them being losers or them trying to communicate and get to know you betters, so just go along with it and share in the laughs. Hanging around the people with the same interests as you also helps. as far as small talk goes, don't come on to strong, just ask the person next to you for help if you need, ask about what subject is next and you can build from there. Always have a smile of your face and be friendly. some one will eventualy notice you and things should go easier. I hope this helps ;D|`|NwT6CpRUaa	what are your hobbies? if you dont have a hobbie get one. hobbies dictate your click usually people will disagree with that but finding common ground leads to friendship and good conversations.   there is nothing wrong with being shy or awkward i used to be. join a club or find some one into what your into. try sticking to your same sex for a little bit because those are the easiest friendships to start without awkward silence. maybe try a sport even if ur not big into sports try it out see how it goes.     as far as ur accent goes have a sense of humor about it. that is a common thing to make fun of people for. my girlfriend has a long island accent and i make fun of her all the time. its actually a good in as long as its play full. if its mean then those are kids to avoid. but dont be turned away by jokes about ur accent its a good ice breaker.     to give u a example of what im trying to say. when i was younger i did everything alone didnt get along with any one and had issues with friends. when i was about 11 i bought a dirt bike started racing got some confidence and stopped trying to impress people. by the time i was 12 i had made tons of friends who rode 4-wheelers and dirtbikes and when i graduated last year i was friends with every one and in the end i could talk my way into and out of any situation..     in essence just be confident and talk about what your into. if its computer games find some one into computer games. if ur into soccer join the team and ask a few team mates to come hang out and watch a game or something after you have gotten to know them.     hope i helped i reolize i was a little scattered but i think i answered ur question.     its not easy to put ureself out there and meet new people but its just about doing it and putting it behind you if it doesnt work out.    u seem like a good hearted person dont shoot yourself down by saying stuff like "I even feel bad for them having to sit next to me" you need to like yourself befor you can have any one else like you just like love lol.|`|eeHgm5hGaa	I use to be shy because I thought people wouldn't like me at school and wouldn't talk and then later on I started getting less shy and when I eventually stopped shy and thought why would someone dislike I did nothing and If they don't like me well I don't care because I'm not here for them and now Im friendly to just about every person I meet. I can honestly make friends super fast because of personality crazy funny can be mean if made and likeable and my shyness had blocked that all out. My record is fast because I became friends with this kid named daniel at lunch in less than a minute I'm serious and you'll stop being shy when you want to it all depends on you|`|5WB2yZUFaa	try showing an interest in whoever it is you would like to be friends with. i find it easiest to break the ice with a sincere compliment. you love her shoes, where did she get them? keep it simple so you don't seem needy or desperate. just hang in there, you sound like a sweetheart! i would love to be your friend! and an accent makes you unique so anyone making fun of you is just insecure. good luck!|`|smdYwFfRaa	yeah I'm the same, apart from the moving countries but. I've been at a school for a few years and have basically no friends. I'm not boring, but I must come across that way because I find conversations hard when I don't automatically click with someone. Conversation always dies and they're talking to their closest mates again and I'm sitting there screaming inside!  You sound like a nice person and you deserve a chance. Don't bother with the people who make fun of your accent and find some people who look like they could be good friends. Find a small group though because big groups are hard for people like you and me (well I find that).   I'm still searching for the friends, but there isn't much option left in my grade. Not sure about your situation, but just go for it and find a small group who will like you for you.  If you wanna talk, just email me.  :)
7CmkRkEMaa	Even though this might not be the answer, I thought that it was interesting that your parents have no idea about your school situation. Obviously, that means your communications are not good at home. I have a alluded to this home thing before, however if it is an option to tell your parents, perhaps that could alleviate some of the trauma by them just knowing. It is just a thought and probably a bigger problem than school upon reflection. But that is the real problem; at home.    Also, going somewhere else, finding new friends, and just getting away will not fix anything. The problem still exists regarding your understanding about society. Ultimately, it is not your fault though, but we do create challenges in each lifetime if one believes in reincarnation. I do insofar as how does one become so smart in one lifetime? I am always amazed at how well you articulate your problems, but cannot seem to solve any? Sometimes I think your questions are written by professionals to see what my answer will be? I know this sounds paranoid, but, in reality, I am kidding. It just is that you write so well for one so young. When I was your age, I couldn't write my name in the ground with a stick (stolen line from Woody Allen). Have you ever considered writing? It is a great escape world and until you sort your social problem it could help. Many authors do this very same thing, get rid of problems by writing stories.     You see, the main thing is that people need outflow and creativity. It is the same with friends. They must be people, you can be yourself with and not put-up some phony facade. Finding the self is the first step, but sometimes this takes years. People assume that they know themselves just by being born, but this is not true. Aforesaid, it is not your fault that you do not know these things since your schooling and home-life have not provided the data. How is it lost in these places is not important because it always happens in history. It is the nature of positive and negative scientific polarities in time and space. The last statement is part of the science that is missing. Believe it or not, man needs proper knowledge before he can act in the world. It would be like driving a car, you must have the skill ahead of time before getting behind the wheel. This skill takes knowledge just as living life in society. It is very didactic and simple advise is not going to answer it. It took me many years to sort my problems, but I was fortunate and succeeded. It does not mean no problems existed for me after self-realisation. However, the nice thing about problems after knowing the self, they are not as big, troublesome, and unmanageable. When developing detachment in which I have alluded in previous answers, you can look at things as distance star, at times, seeing the whole thing as a gigantic comedy for your amusement. When this view happens, you have self-realisation knowing that you cannot control everything, but you can relax about what you cannot.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	Finish out 12, and then move away to go to college...    Just endure until the current situation comes to an tidy end...|`|j5ethbfeaa	Yeah, just wait it off.  Find ways to entertain yourself or if you still wanna bother and try, you can find people who you didn't know about before and try to talk to them.|`|NO43XYA2aa	you should check out stormwind darnassus or ironforge. I 'll bet you anything that you will get along with everybody.|`|9xVwpZ0faa	i am in a similar sitiuation as you. it is day 4 at my new college and i absolutely hate it. but i have no choice but to live through it as my parents will kill me if i fo not have a certificate. i personally would rather work. i cant get along with my school mates too, the things we talk about are so superficial.|`|W8krObaCaa	Well, I've started in a new school this year, doing year 11, it was day 2 and I was alone at lunchtime, although day 1 was just a short day. I talked to a few people briefly but no one has invited me to hang out with them or whatever.    I guess I may have to wait it out as well.
LWpUjTHmaa	I don't have a lot music for funerals but I think this one is great http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsR8tY2ps... It's a song called Lilium, I first heard it from an opening theme of a anime, The singer is Japanese so I assume the lyrics are Japanese but it also sounds like Italian so I'm not sure about that part.|`|en9Xk0h2aa	Forever by Stratovarius is a beautiful song and should go well for your slideshow.|`|hiY7CCc7aa	I'll be missing you by puff daddy  or the theme song from Pearl Harbour???|`|LLR14l3Uaa	If your relative was a Christian, you can use any number of 'gospel' type songs.  My wife always pulls the car over and cries when "Go Rest High on that Mountain." by Vince Gill comes on the radio.  They played it at her grandfather's funeral a few years back.  It's a nice song.  Talks about taking a rest, that the decease's work is done.  They get to go be with God.      If your relative wasn't Christian, I am afraid I don't know any good mourning songs that have a positive spin.  I am sure they are out there, I just haven't been exposed to them.      Good luck in your search.  And deepest sympathies at your loss.|`|4KtPFzz5aa	Do Not Stand At My Grave And Weep  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jynpGNaSA...    I am very sorry for your loss.

Some one who wants to hang out with you.  She is a waste of your time.  She will continue to play you and take your feelings for granted.  It will get easier once you take that first step.  Good luck|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	7 months....come on....|`|yDctxo1paa	get playboy and have fun|`|hfru4jp8aa	hey you are not alone i lost my first true love 6months ago  im 22 and she was 19 and it would have been 3 years in march but one day she came too me and said i dont love you anymore get out of my life and when she said that i fell too the floor and passed out. It killed me inside she was me princess.I did all i could too get her back.But after 6months I still think about her but not as much as i used too.I know that she is with a new guy has sex with him it tears me up too.When i think about her at times still i just break down and cry. I threw away the few pictures i had.But I try too keep me self busy and it helps me out.I think if she doning drugs it most likely will get worse and i would not want that at all.She could be trying too keep you from being happy.I feel bad for you i really do.You just got to try your best and take it day by day.Now I have no one either.You and me have been hurt and walked on and most of the timeif women do that i think that means they really didnt care about there man or not knowing they had someone who really cared and never saw it.  If you ever want too talk send me a email  rcbrinker@att.net|`|0267b4b30705032220d53177414ef86aaa	Yeah, I was feeling your pain, until you got to the point about her being 15 and you being 16, and well......    pwwwaahahahhHAHHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!...    Are you serious??? What are you going to accomplish with somebody who's 15? "I'll show you mine if you show me yours?"    Are you even in the REALM of reality here??    She's 15!!!!! She was watching "Dora The Explorer" 3 years ago, man!!!! What the hell's wrong with you?!!   You ain't ready for anything serious! Do you even have a job? Does she?? Concentrate on school!!!! Find a good job after you're done with school! Stop being ridiculous! 15 year old girls DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT. The only thing they know is that they want older guys to treat them like they're adults! Ya hear me? They're IDIOTS. Why else would she be making out with "guys in the ocean?" Because, like an idiot, she's willing to do whatever it takes for guys to treat her like an adult! Even sacrifice her integrity. Only a CHILD would be willing to act like an idiot in order to be viewed like an adult! ONLY A CHILD.     What time is it?? You should be in bed!!!! Go to sleep!!!    Good grief!|`|chZFmJOPaa	Drop her. Move on. Work on yourself.

She's obviously got many issues from drugs to whatever else you may not be aware of.     Only time will heal you. However, if you hook up with someone new that usually helps you heal faster. Only because your not stuck in the past. If you do meet someone new treat her with respect and kindness. Remember that not all girls are like your ex.|`|r07mkYWHaa	Your worried because you care. She needs to get her **** together though or shes going to end in a bad bad spot. You are also destroying your confidence by playing her games. Stand up to her and tell her how you really feel. Yes, you have slept with other people, you weren't together. Obviously you have both hurt each other, and if you can both be mature enough to except this and rust one another again and cut the crap then you might be able to stabilize. It really sounds hopeless to me though.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	You are 16! Why are you sleeping around and letting this girl play games with you? So much unnecessary drama. You do deserve better. I understand that she was your 'first', but I don't see why you need to keep her in you life when all she does is make you feel confused and miserable. Can you drop her and dating altogether and spend your time on making it through school and making positive friendships instead? Then maybe the 'craziness' will go away.|`|uReFjOONaa	only 7months C'mon|`|k0JPpmC7aa	i know exactly how you feel with the whole 7 months kinda-thing...its hard and i havent even had the guts to delete pictures/messages|`|KKhc5UiYaa	Want to know what Skate decides??????|`|vYwNPF9Uaa	move on, you are young and you can meet a lot of girls. don't waste your time with her. one day you might meet a girl that you would want to be her for the rest of your life without fooling around. don't do to others that you don't want others done to you|`|J6X14hWIaa	go for other girls and try and move on but dont forget about her. friendship is good and if you get the chance to hookup with her thats fine but dont get into a relationship because she is a crazy bipolar *****. just try to find a new girl and make her your girl on the side just like your her fallback.|`|Pmt56tnzaa	It's been about 6 months for me. And i agree with the other guy i can't even delete pics or messages. But my situation is different. Dude all i can really tell you is to ask you're self if you love her. It might take awhile to figure it out for sure but when you answer the question then you will know what to do trust me. Good luck bro and God Bless.
5ph71VMvaa	He wants to have sex with you now and it's more important to him than you waiting to get married.  And that is what is making the situation awkward.    That is my honest opinion and I'm sticking to it.|`|sdoHia3Xaa	He definately has feelings for you, and i think youre in a position where you dont know what you want. i say this because i can relate myself to this guy not exactly but i was attracted to a friend who was exactly how you describe yourself, we would flirt and get pretty flirtacious at certain periods, but like you i dont think she knew what she wanted i think she saw us as more as friends then anything and like this guy i thought she was playing with my feelings so i tried my hardest to not have feelings for her but it was always on my mind. the fact that he tells you hes fooling around with woman and saying he hasnt found the right girl yet is telling you that he seems to attracted to you, those other girls are an excuse to see how you would react. because he wants you to know his business. Long story short he still has feelings for you.
1ViGcF3xaa	Ok, I'm no dating expert but if he is being a jerk to you then why put up with him?  You're right, the logical thing to do is just leave and the reason you probably can't is because you're a little scared which is normal.  Once you do it you'll be sad for a little bit but will be happier in the long run.  (BTW, doing this could also be the solution to your other question)!|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Hi Friend    You know I love Ya, You're one of the Best Friends I've ever had these past 2 years, and I think You are a truly wonderful and unique Person.     I'll tell You plain, if He's being a Jerk towards You that pisses Me off, You deserve about 10 tons better, and frankly behaviour like that rarely if ever changes. The longer You continue the relationship the worse it will probably get.     You need a Guy that'll treat You like a Goddess, cause that's what You are, not somebody that acts like a Jackass towards You. There are decent Guys out there and since You're in College now, well I bet there are a ton there.    The best advice I can give You is don't stay in a bad relationship one minute longer.|`|0a88332d968993b9b9d62ec94243eb24aa	I am sorry you have this dilemma.  I don't know enough about you or your friend to be able to give a more profound answer that would really help you make a decision.  From personal experience I can tell you that it might be difficult to go back from a romantic involvement to "let's be buddies"  friendship , at least not soon. It took me over 10 years, a marriage ( 2 marriages in my friend's case) to be able to find a common ground to feel comfortable again. We are best friends now and I accept our past, present and future. And in my case we did not even sever our affair in bad terms, no drama or War of the Roses we went through.....but the human being is complex.    The only thing I hope is whatever you are going through does not affect your studies and your emotional well being. Look for ways to distract yourself, work out and go out with your friends there to feel better. Setting limits and putting an end to some things is also part of the phenomenon of growing up and becoming an adult. You are a smart young lady so I am sure you will make the right choices!    *** great tune Will! Now you made me think of one also!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE7sGbnbq...|`|AA11234673	I think it's time for you to move on...|`|XOgvpDiZaa	Since last summer??    He shouldn't have changed; he should be the same person you knew as a friend. That's strike  1. You should've ended things when this first happened.    End it already. What do you think is there if you said that this isn't going anywhere?|`|pJ7icz0taa	Move on..it's never going to change..you both are growing apart and you are wasting time,  end it.   Go on and enjoy yourself and meet someone that is going to make you happy.  you are in a "I am stuck" in a bad situation and only YOU can get out of it.   Do it before it's too late and the years pass you by.|`|h9XfQDxNaa	?|`|chZFmJOPaa	I went through this. Unfortunately in a situation like that, where its not a relationship, but youre more than friends. Its hard to stay strictly friends.    You just cut off connections for a while. You dont call and answer his calls. Dont waste your time with someone who doesnt want anything more.|`|IQq0wNqQaa	It seems like it's over. He tries to pull you back in because he is probably afraid of losing his backup girl (which is you, by the way). If he has made no move to make your relationship a serious one (after you have been dating almost a year now), then I assure you - he has other things going on elsewhere. You should quit while you are ahead. Don't go visit him at college, just distance yourself from him for a while. You have seen the pattern of the ups and downs, and every time you try to back off he tries to give you incentive to stay. He is not making the effort to make your relationship worthwhile until you threaten to get out of it. That's not good or healthy, nor is it going to turn good or healthy. At this point, you should try and salvage your friendship (after taking some time to be a part). Move on romantically, you don't need to be with a person who makes you question whether or not you should be wasting your time with him to people online! You deserve better than that, and I think you know that - you are just waiting to hear it out loud from someone else. If you have to question whether or not it's time to move on, then it most certainly is time to move on.|`|GrhiWC4uaa	I think you answered your own question....I would say move on and if possible try to mend things...Do not wait til the point of you guys hating each other..It is not worth it..Do not pretend and lie to yourself or each other and pretend that everything will work out if it has not already...Just quit dating and just remain friends or w/e...Do not date just because you want to be in a relationship with someone..There might be someone waiting for you who will be a lot better and a lot closer to your area than the guy your with..If you two stay together?you might miss that nice guy that is probably in your area...Doesn't sound like it is going anywhere..Long distance relationships are really hard to do and rarely work out..|`|il0Rch2Eaa	You know its time when you ask the question you have just asked UnhappyFace Meep. Dragging it out will cause the friendship to ultimately end in a not so happy way but only you can make that choice HH. Either way I'm always here for you as I know others here are too!!   Here's a tune that may help bring things into perspective...  Peace to you Lil Purp!!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfgGUlBry...
OxnFnyqPaa	I personally think that this guy is just not into you.  You should let him go.  He is giving you obvious signs and reasons that he doesn't like you as much.  Don't contact him and let him run towards you.  You should know that there are many other guys who would die to be with someone like you.    So give it time and meet new people.    Good luck and hope this helps! ^__^|`|KxAmrVBfaa	I think hes just playing around with your feelings    I had an ex that did that     One moment he hated my guts and was calling me every name under the sun the next he was questioning me about where i was going and telling me he loved me and then the next he was being a jerk    You just get to a point where you know yourself that your sick and tired of being dragged along and then months later he s still saying he loves me but ive moved on now because its not good for a person to keep getting everything dragged up and not letting the past go     He will regret it     Just move on it will be for the best

fzIeGPZYaa	wow you sound like a total @$$ 145 is not fat, seriously i doubt you are perfect and even if you were that doesnt give you an excuse to treat a woman like a piece of meat that lives for your pleasure|`|AA10461616	Honestly,  you couldn't help your physical reaction, BUT you could have helped your verbal reaction- BIG TIME.  Anything would have been better than how you handled it, even a fib such as you were not feeling well.  If you knew this lady well enough to know her exact weight of 145 lbs, then you certainly knew her long enough to know you were not attracted to her, unless you are also so shallow you ask a lady you don't even know what her weight is right off the bat.    That being said, having worked for a major ladies lingerie company for many years, in which I had to learn how to do bra fittings, I'd say I have seen more female breasts than most guys.  Even the very very skinny girls that have very large breasts are not going to look very good with their shirts off unless they have implants.  Breasts are composed of fat and even 18 year olds have some sag when very large breasted.  And unless she was very short, 145 is not that big.      And did your big ego ever think there might have been another reason she was crying hysterically?  Maybe it was your limp body part and SHE was turned off!    And no, I am not heavy- just the opposite, 5"8" and 120 lbs if I eat a ton, so it's not just ladies that weigh more that are going to nail you on this one.|`|weBvwrloaa	ok, so you found yourself "suddenly" unattracted to a "large"(?) girl. Fine, but there were a million ways that you could have handled that situation so much better then you did. You could have told a white lie and told her that you werent feeling well due to the alcohol or whatever and thought maybe it was a good idea if she just went home. You did not have to be so curt to her or tell her in such a away to make her feel horrible and cry.  As I tell my kid..THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK. Yes, you did really do her wrong.|`|AA12400627	You are a TROLL and this has been posted up before! You're a repeat poster!~|`|aY3s1B9xaa	Oh my...boy, someone needs to slap you upside the head!

hBFSQ9bbaa	when my husband and i first went on our first "hangout" we talked about funny stories from our past.  embarrassing moments from childhood like running into a screen door or getting depanced.  its a good opportunity to let your guard down slightly, be able to admit humility, imperfection.  when we ran out of stories about ourselves, it led to stories our friends told us or some cool war story froma  long lost uncle...just roll with it.  be yourself and laugh a lot.  if someone likes you, the best way to make them happy is to be yourself and keep laughing, they'll love it!
hBFSQ9bbaa	i live in alaska and when i was in high school theres always scraggly-looking men camping on the beach trying to get a fishing job.  some me and my female friends used to go around and ask them for alcohol.  they always had some.  and if they didn't they'd buy it for us.  : )  alaska is so great like that.  this of course also applied to weed.|`|1e2a96e8b8d3f5e2b82c65ea8e07b92daa	well it isnt legal to do that so, uh ya might wanna stop|`|BY6CneFFaa	Wow that is interesting.

q1EuhTD9aa	-Not thinking or saying or mentioning or acting like you are superior and better than the rest.(even if you are)    -Being nice to everyone and being respectful.Treat others the way you want to be treated.    -Treating everyone equally and not having "favorites".    -Be an inspiration to the rest of the employess/people and make them want to succeed higher and higher.    Those i personally think are the main qualities of a good and loyal boss.=]|`|41LpZrOxaa	I believe a good boss is someone who not only leads- but also knows how to follow. Someone who willing to work with his subordinates not work above, delegate, keep the lines of communication open and listen . those whom i had to supervise knew i had there back in any situation as long as they had mine when it came to job performance. i made it a point to provide recognition when recognition was due. and also punished in private. a good boss knows their strengths and also- their limitations. good luck!|`|PYg016ZRaa	ones that call u over to their house to spend the night :)|`|ow5JEbt9aa	u must be genuine and be and true.

41LpZrOxaa	i am military and i have been to korea- and i know you can relate when i say- it is a fishbowl there. you said he told you he was married- going through a divorce- but he went back to his wife when his time in korea was over- and same w/ you. - i believe you should move on. i knew of a couple of couples who met in korea -'fell in love' and got married and came back to the states and within a few years divorced because things are surreal in korea and they were finally able to create a relationship in the 'real world' and realized they had nothing in common. you may be just hung up on the 'what ifs'. remain friends for a few years-see where it takes you. in the mean time- i would keep my options open... good luck!
c6685a97496f5bbace11430b49254facaa	Stop it ' ever heard of codependency when you leave an  abusive relationship you tend to carry on or express unhealthy behaviors due to the abuse' unknown you find yourself think-en that its you because  the abuse  is no longer there' your not loved ..unhealthy  in your mind  the abuse feels good to you'  because  you wont to be love' give yourself time to heal what is broken' in you before you start a new relationship if not..YOU will find yourself provoke Eng your new mate to abuse you because your way of reasoning is not healthy' what ever love your seeking its in you' when you start loving you' Than is when the right love will come your way' because others will notice that you love yourself' and then  they will be wanting you' to love them ..don't ask why but it is what is. what you do' to the inside of your body trust' It will show on the out side of your body so start loving you so that others will know that you are worthy to be loved..|`|AA11426515	After an abusive relationship, you are able to relate to the hurt and pain of another person. Therefore, you are probably more sensitive. Having been in an abusive relationship can also affect your overall outlook of people in general and tends to mistrust. Perhaps counselling may help you get back to your old self. You need confidence booster to regain your confidence.    At least, you are no longer in the rut and have moved on. There are thousands of others in an abusive relationship who doesn't have the determination to send to end the ordeal.    Good luck!|`|nn0uj8Hhaa	Surely I felt the same way.. Try to pretend that this is not that way, just imagination.|`|Fck1Vx0waa	I allowed myself to be in an abusive relationship for 3 years, not physically but mentally he brought me down hard. He always told me I was fat (size 4, 114 lbs, I'm 5'5) so I only had maybe 2 or 3 meals a week, he told me that no one else would want me, called me ugly (I don't feel I am now and was never told that before). My mother saw a difference in my mood, I was never happy and always had mood swings and my temper was horrible. She begged me to try counseling, so I did. I ended up quitting the counseling when she told me it was my boyfriend that was making me who I was. Finally one day it clicked and I broke up with him. My self esteem was horrible still after that and I basically didn't understand why I couldn't look as good as everyone else. Then I met a man that changed my life, he brought me back up so much. Still though to this day, I can be very vain about myself. I always try to look my best and if I can't reach that "best" status to myself, I get mad at myself but my fiance is helping with that everyday and he understands.    The point to all of that is that it's tough to get back to your normal self after being in a bad relationship like that but eventually you will come out of it and the people you meet and feel comfortable explaining your situation to and why you may act in certain ways, they'll be there to lift you back up. God has a plan and it turns out to be amazing! Good luck.
tnbFzvxkaa	My brother. We were always tight, had the most amazing bond (mummys gone, its just us now) but as we got older he got on the drugs, grog, hit me, I moved away immediately, it upset him...... he hasnt worked in 17 years..dole bludger... has 2 kids he doesnt see, doesnt pay child support. the world owes him, everyone is out to get him. only rings for money, steals my engagement ring and other stuff to sell..... Gave him plenty of chances. after 3 years i went to visit. he got drunk and called me every name under the sun because i have assets now, he has nothing.... I still love him and would like to think id be there for him, but hes given me such a battering i couldnt be too sure..... but honestly i wouldnt care if i never saw him again.... im so sick of victims.|`|AA11426515	My sister-in-law for 2 years. She is just insanely jealous about every tiny thing my parents-in-law does for me. She has done a lot of emotional damage to me and my husband. I don't plan to talk to her for the rest of my life.|`|3ef361cea1b14ac260b9597c3dd279ecaa	My sister, 5 years, she was totally addicted to coke and in her own weird world.
AA11426515	First, you have to identify what is the real problem that caused the breakup. I don't think rushing into things was the reason. You were best friends so you both would have known each other very much. Then you moved on to become lovers - what happened? It must be something about either of your atttitude, behavior or some issues between the two of you. Looks like both of you love each other but there are hurdles that both of you cannot handle. In order to sort out the relationship, you have to work on the issues that caused the break-up in the 1st place. Or, could it be that he is not ready for a permanent relationship?
AA11426515	I have put up with craps for 10yrs and when I left the relationship, I felt tons lighter. It felt so good to be single, doing things only for myself, at my own time and no worries about the other person in my life. Then I began to reorganize my social life and made new friends.     You will be amazed by how good you feel about yourself. When you feel good about yourself, others will feel good being around you too. Don't rush into finding a new guy. After all the craps, you will be wiser in the next relationship. When you are ready, make sure you find a guy who will make life even better than being single!    Good luck!|`|rMq9D06Faa	If you have put up with crap for 7 years, are you sure you are in the right frame of mind to look for another guy?    Make sure you aren't still harbouring resentment because it is not fair to bring that judgement/baggage into the next relationship!      Don't let the new guy pay for the sins of the last jerk!    How do you find a new guy?    Just make yourself open and receptive to men.  This time you might want to choose a different kind of guy!    You could also be proactive and approach a guy that you like.|`|jQBDxh17aa	be patient.  I was married for 7 and a half years and put up with so much crap it was unreal.  Coming out of a relationship where you had to deal with stress caused by the other person sometimes makes trusting and setting healthy boundries an issue.      Take your time, don't jump into anything too quickly and enjoy yourself.  Take time to figure out who you are and what you want in life.    I know it's difficult to do, I'm 34 and feel like my life is slipping away.  But I'm speaking from experience when I say this.  Do not jump into anything too fast.      Good luck.|`|9DBCf6sDaa	The same way you found the first one. Plan oneveryone you meet to have  crap to put up with .     By the way you don't give anybody crap?|`|El2HTKaUaa	If you had to put up with so much crap you should have left his *** after year one    start from scratch, but this time it will be better because if you had 7 years putting up with crap, you will be able to smell the guys that are full of crap from a mile away.    If it dont kill you, it will only make you stronger    good luck|`|jJhzRKPNaa	First off honey good for u.  You hav desided that u are better then that and u deserve better.  High 5 to u.  Second take your time.  When God thinks your ready then it will happen.  Remember that it has to happen in Gods time not your own.  Talk to people.  Go out. Take time for yourself.  Don't rush.  I know it's hard to be alone.  I was married for 7 years to a real jerk.  I have been single about a year and a half.  It is ok to b alone for awile.  I have been on a few dates.

In a long-term relationship, things are changing all the time.  There are ups and downs.  Sometimes the feelings will be stronger and sometimes not.    I think many people will tell you that "if the feeling isn't there, then move on".  However, this is exactly why we have this society of divorce.     There isn't a constant state of 100% adoration, bliss, affection, desire and whatever else you want to call it.   This is a myth.     You don't feel the same.  Did you think you would feel the same for the rest of you life?  Embrace the changes in life and make your decisions on something other than emotions.  Emotions will trick you and send you on an endless trail of fulfillment, that never comes.    Base your relationship on shared goals, respect, truth, love, family...these are actual qualities that you can judge.  Emotions like happy, fulfilled, excited, infatuated....these are qualities that can't be judged because they will change too often and are fickle.
AA11426515	Continue with the friendship - keep in touch via email, phone, text or IM on a regular basis. With things planned for the future, go for it. Let it flow for awhile and see how she reacts.    If she is keen, she will always be there for you and will appear eager and happy when you are around. Given time, she will show signs of interest as I am sure she will want indications from you too, if she is keen.    Give yourself a time frame to see how things will move from here. Rushing her may force her to reject you if she is not ready.|`|7lvVMzGHaa	Ask her out or something, but it seems like she's into you. Ask her if she thinks of you as a friend.|`|ggTF431Qaa	friends

Just make sure to take it slow and gently the first time and don't be to discouraged if you don;t like it all that much the first time is always weird and next time will be better.

If you do find her attractive and want to persue a physical relationship you may want to talk to her about it and get things clarified before you two become all out buddies.

Yes, I do. They are the most important people in my life. Without them, I won't even be here. I try my best to keep them happy and do what I can for them. I don't want to have any regrets when they leave me someday.    They may appear uncooperative, disagree with you or prevent you from doing things you like BUT whatever parents do for their children, its always for the best interest of their children. Parents are the only people who will love you UNCONDITIONALLY.

b9b93c4c3e1a1b177789014898e199e5aa	oh.. ouch.. that's tough because i mean guys do have feeligns and the jealousy thing does kick in if they see you moved on and say they didnt.. and they have a bad relationship.. it MIGHT work out if you try it... MIGHT!!! im not saying it will because it might not but hey I COULD BE TOTALLY WRONG! and it could work out you two could be very happy together and have little courtney's and somthings running around the house lol ya know? Think of the future be smart and follow your heart.. do what you think is right.. i mean i honestly have been in the situation where i had a gf told her the same stuff (cept the first kiss thing...haha) and then broke up with her... went for someone else she moved on and so did i.. i had a relationship going on with this girl.. thing is that she played me... and yeah... then i had a few late lonely nights and started saying those same things again.. it was a mistake all in all because i mean i honestly dont feel that way and i regret it and all.. but if you trust him then you have every right to believe it should work out.. NOT EVERY GUY IS LIKE ME! lol.. i didnt mean to lie so please dont think wrong of me.. there are some nights i do think of her tho so yeah dont think im a total prick because right now we are together yet she lives in wisconsin and live in california.. yeah.. see.. lol but yeah GOOD LUCK|`|3c0d1554940166e4a75ccdc1800e7a83aa	if it didnt work out twice then it probably wont work out a 3rd time. he probably just wants to make sure u dont go out with other guys. hes jealous. :D|`|cbc5b506edc1f2467288ec9315aabce5aa	they say third times the charm but he's playing the green eye monster game he is jealous there is a time to let go or give it another try if you feel like he is just messing with your feelings don't give him the time of day ask him to look you in the eye and say that he doesn't love you anymore it's just a test|`|5l2ngAuWaa	umm i think maybe he cares for you alot and thinks he loves you and maybe the only reason he said that he didnt love you was because he was upset and tried to hurt your feelings.  & then when he found out you were going to go with other people it probably opened his eyes and made him realize what he's done.  && he is most likely just jealous and wants to be with you again...

fDiVd44Raa	Io son fidanzata da 4 anni col mio migliore amico. Prima di metterci insieme ci conoscevamo da 8 anni e anche se sapevo che lui aveva un debole per me (confessato e respinto per due volte), eravamo molto amici, lui era il mio migliore amico e ci raccontavamo tutto, lui mi faceva partecipe delle sue infatuazioni e io gli ho parlato quasi tutti i giorni per 3 anni del mio ex fidanzato, che era anche suo caro amico. Anche se la mia amicizia era sincera (a me lui non piaceva proprio ed era l'ultima persona con la quale mi sarei messa) lui per, in fondo nutriva sempre la speranza di star con me e quando si  accorto che non c'era nulla da fare mi ha iniziata a trascurare un p, a cercare seriamente un altra,poi  partito per fare il militare ed  stato proprio quando si  allantonato che ho capito quanto era imporante lui per me, e quanto in realt mi piaceva, quanto ci stavo bene e quanto mi mancava. Ho lasciato il mio ex per lui e nel giro di pochissimo stavamo insieme. All'inizio  stato stranissimo, non lo riuscivo neanche a baciare(mi sembrava di baciare mio fratello!) e mi mettava molto imbarazzo stare con lui da sola, senza la nostra compagnia di amici , oppure avere atteggiamenti pi intimi per me era un problema!Infatti il primo bacio ce lo siamo dati dopo 2 settimane...ma se devo essere sincera  stata una buona scelta. Il rapporto che c' fra di noi  molto profondo, anche se le cose da amici a fidanzati cambiano e si complicano tantissimo. A volte penso che forse sarebbe stato meglio rimanere amici, perch mi manca la sua amicizia, mi manca potergli parlare in maniera libera e disinteressata come si fa pi con gli amici...e ho una paura bestiale del fatto che se un giorno dovessimo lasciarci perderei il mio pi caro amico e il mio pi dolce "amante"...|`|0q8BjPAraa	Sono stata con un mio amico ma non credo fosse proprio amore, comunque dopo quell'esperienza ci siamo legati di pi!

Dopo   averla raccolta le spine continueranno ad esserci ma conoscendone la dislocazione sar pi facile tenerla in mano   per apprezzarne il profumo e la bellezza.

8jJEEhyTaa	Ma quello  perch a volte le donne non hanno orgoglio,comunque il mantenimento dovrebbe essere calcolato in base alla situazione finanziaria dei due coniugi.  Se il medico passa 1900 euro vuol dire che vive pi che decentemente anche senza.  Io per esempio conosco una signora benestante che passa il mantenimento al marito disoccupato e lei lavora e ha 2 figli a carico.  Ti do ragione in parte perch da donna non tollero quelle donne che fanno le mantenute,godono del privilegio e neanche cercano un lavoro,si fanno la bella vita alle spalle degli ex mariti anche quando vivono con un nuovo compagno.  Tirate fuori le palle!!!|`|WW0tqq3zaa	beh io direi che questa non se la passa male..........  ma sai il sesso pi debole siamo sempre noi donne e i bambini...  al lavoro ci assumono soltanto a part time o in determinato  raro che ci assumono in  indeterminato.....  ovvio vhe i bambini non possono lavorare per cui giuridicamente sono incapaci di agire.............  naturale che vengono diffesi prima degli uomini..........  non cerco di protteggere noi soggetti deboli ma spiego la realt .......ovvio che anche l'uomo quando  incapace di agire viene retribuito....o no?!!|`|76VxS3Rtaa	si le donne si mettono con i ricchi ,per io ti dico che i ricchi cele fanno mettere ,cos sono pari, perche non credo che una donna vada con la pistola da un ricco e gli dica o ti metti con me o ti sparo, se si mettono in sieme  perche gli piace anche a lui .  io ammetto  che la giovane (perche credimi sono sempre quelle pi giovani e belle che vanno a caccia dei soldi) vada cercando chi la mantiene bene, per l'uomo  molto lusingato di farlo specialmente se  un p su con gli anni,e tu mi vieni a dire che la legge  ingiusta con gli uomini ,ma se lui ci casca e si f prendere per il naso da una furbetta ,io dico perche non si  fatto pi furbo lui e non ci cascava ,rispondere con un mi dispiace ,ma non sei il mio tipo non ci vuole molto ,in questo modo si sarebbe preservato da tante delusioni e grane|`|1f023db3e89570f0653cae6cb45b9862aa	Questi sono discorsi da morti di fame. E se permetti, un uomo che raschia il barile sul mantenimento del proprio figlio, mi fa pure un po' schifo.    In ogni caso, le mie figlie le mantengo io, cos non devo rendere grazie a nessun morto di fame.|`|8648d3cecfa397a24e46e7eb1e95785faa	Non facciamo confusione.  Se la moglie lavora per cui  in grado di potersi mantenere non le v nessun assegno di mantenimento, almeno che non sia una tamtum per altre questioni(propriet in comune o prestiti o mutui in comune ecc.).  Al figlio va mantenuto lo stesso tenore di vita che aveva prima della separazione.  L'assegno di mantenimento viene calcolato in base al reddito(Unico o 730 o 740)e non dovrebbe superare il 1/5 del reddito.  Sono d'accordo non nostante io sia una donna nella separazione  sempre l'uomo che paga il prezzo pi alto e moltissime volte non lo meritano.|`|05a5a3288fda04aa8846fb2266a0b774aa	conosco tante donne avide e spudorate cos come conosco  persone che si sono trovate da sole a tirare su un figlio  senza un lavoro  e senza marito, a 19 anni...  se capitasse a me, sinceramente me ne fregherei dell'assegno (per me), se non ho il mio uomo accanto  non  vivere.    Chi poi decide di aggrapparsi ai soldi  senza dubbio una donna di bassa lega... e provo pena per queste persone,  non hanno trovato il piacere della vita (per me, l' amore) e lo cercano al livello pi basso, i soldi|`|KLdPqugVaa	per uno che sborsa 1900 euro ce ne sono 10 che non ti danno niente e neppure si interessano della prole. vai tranquillo che non vi rovinate!|`|f5IFEtWKaa	Nel caso di separazione gli unici ad avere il diritto ad essere tutelati sono i figli.  Purtroppo si devono fissare delle cifre, che non sono affatto rappresentative.  Nel senso che quando si  una famiglia le spese vanno e vengono, secondo i bisogni e le esigenze.  Quando ci si separa, si guarda al reddito: anche se sono molte le donne che lucrano su questa cosa, magari perch hanno lavori sommersi, che consentono loro di mantenersi, ma poich non risultano, non possono essere documentate e messe in un verbale di separazione.  E' un discorso complesso, anche se qualcosa mi dice che a rendere complicate e ingiuste le separazioni  la stupidit dei coniugi, su cui nessun giudice, anche il pi illuminato,pu riuscire a legiferare.|`|oW0PRv3Maa	Ti parlo da "donna che guarda ai soldi".  Sono separata , ho due figli piccoli e per loro  previsto un mantenimento di 500 euro. E 100 euro per me.  Sono 600 al mese, hai presente? E bisogna VIVERCI, bollette e tutto.  Tu prova, e dimmi come si sta.  Se il medico in questione, secondo reddito, pu privarsi di quella cifra, figuriamoci qual' il suo guadagno. Parli di tutela, ma io non credo che il signore in questione possa trovarsi nella condizione di morire di fame.    Io vorrei solo che la si smettesse con questa solfa trita e ritrita delle donne parassite, che pensano solo al soldo, che si mettono con i ricchi, che vogliono solo fare le mantenute.  E basta...sempre a farne una questione di genere, come se poi l'uomo, al soldo, non guardasse mai.  Ce ne sono tante altre di donne, che si sbattono tra uffici comunali ed assistenti sociali dalla mattina alla sera, che si devono far uscire dal fianco i soldi per gli avvocati perch il marito non passa loro gli assegni, perch non dichiara il vero guadagno, perch una volta separato improvvisamente dimentica di essere un padre ed abbandona ogni responsabilit.  Parliamo adesso, di tutela?  Se voi solo sapeste quante e quali altre realt sommerse che ci sono, la piantereste di mietere a piene mani tra filari di preconcetti e luoghi comuni....sveglia.|`|wp2kB0gQaa	Io anzi che sposarmi per interesse anzi rimanere zittella!|`|eS5Gg3OCaa	hai perfettamente ragione tu il minimo che si pu fare per tutelarsi dai danni postmatrimoniali  fare la diviasione dei beni come ho fatto io con mia moglie.|`|uzPQL8SGaa	Guarda secondo me dipende da tante cose. Se  il marito a tradire ripetutamente la moglie,  lui a lasciarla, a mettersi con una nuova compagna e a fare figli con altre cos a cuor leggero e magari la moglie ha rinunciato a tante cose compreso il lavoro per la famiglia io direi che alla moglie spetta il mantenimento finch non trova un lavoro. Il figlio costa tanto con l'euro, forse non 1000 euro ma almeno 500/700. Comunque dipende sempre dal lavoro del padre. Se il padre  impiegato e guadagna 1300,00 euro io direi che al figlio ne pu dare 500 ma se guadagna molto di pi allora la cosa  diversa. Poi diciamo pure che molti uomini non lo dnno questo mantenimento, saltano dei mesi e l sono le ex mogli a dover fare i salti mortali.|`|yCiMy1Qcaa	stai tranquillo che i padri non vanno in galera a parole...magari il mio ex  libero e io spendo soldi dall avvocato per ottenere cio che mi spetta che sono 200 euro el suo stipendio  di 2000 comunque non penso che quando ti sposi se lo fai per amore pensi al mantenimento che ti viene se ti separi...e se il medico da quella cifra vuol dire che il suo stipendio glielo permette

e995af7792f3a3d4a5dbc91bdf3d8d6caa	What do you mean you are expecting more? Dating is just the normal stuffs; movies, strolling, sharing a drink together etc, it's basically things you usually do with your friends, just that this time you are doing it with someone you like.  Maybe you should rethink if you like this guy.|`|y5NNYM5iaa	just take it step by step you am still quite young so there is no need to rush anything.... make the most of being young|`|zNqOc8lBaa	Think positive and get to make somthing nice for to feel better, talk to a good friend about it, it can make you feel better.

ASDqdTpUaa	Whatever you feel and want to do, do not call him first!    You already made the first move once. If he doesn't respond right away it could be because he's shy or playing the game, but it could also mean that he's just not very interested in you. If it's the last one then you risk ending up looking desperate. Which is something you definitely don't want.     Play hard to get. It is human instinct to want something we cannot have. If you wait to call him he will be wondering why you haven't called him and will think about you more.     Trust me, this has always worked for me. Don't risk feeling desperate for someone you met in a club. There are sooo many guys out there, and if this one isn't taking the initiative, you will find someone who does.     I have a feeling that if you don't call him, it will work to your benefit.     Good Luck and stop stressing girl!|`|074a932a2047927589dd952d4be5e933aa	well Im sorry he dosent really like u if he says that he going to call u back and he dosent!

Try to go on a date to somewhere you can talk. That'll give both of you an idea of who the other is. Right now, neither of you have a clue.

Everything about us seems so right. You can show you love him by hugging and kissing him (the forehead and cheeks are sweet, endearing places to kiss), smiling and laughing a lot. If being in his presence makes your heart happy, don't hold anything back--be completely you. There's nothing like telling a person you love them by being so comfortable with them and showing every side of you: the silly side, the serious side, the vulnerable side. You get the picture. It never hurts to just verbally tell him you love him, as well. =)

XrFtiHqeaa	I read a few responses without any intent on answering but... the answers were so bad and not what I guy wants.  So.... let me start by saying it's a cute idea for a girl but guys don't want birthday cards.  Maybe if he was 4-9 years old.      At 18 he just wants you to acknowledge it is his birthday and say something nice.  Then, you can talk to him later to see how his birthday went.  If he likes you he will talk... and if he talks this is your chance to say that "we" never did anything for your b-day.  But, for all the guys I know - a card isn't going to do anything for him.  That's just a fact for most guys.|`|43b3fc46f5e0746407f46b876475c618aa	tell him his birthday present is wrapped up in your clothing and he should hurry and unwrap it.

And in reference to your freinds, get new ones!|`|128b03f5cbdd1dfaf8b251c808f25c2baa	the answer is there. she rearranged the story because of this guy! why would you leave someone who seems wonderful for a "friend" who puts guys between the two of you? there is no guy worth for friendship, but if that's the kind of friend you have, who needs enemies? and she's even setting a deal with you in pay for your friendship! wtf?? stay with him. they should grow up. and your "friend" should eat her heart out.|`|UtCV0qjWaa	I hate to say it but this really is very childish and my thoughts are that you and your friends are pretty young.  If you could sit down and have a civil conversation with your "friend" then you should tell her what you think. In my experience, if your friends and your boyfriend don't get along and it ends up being serious you will pull away from your friends.  In the end your friends are the ones who will save you and always be at your side.  Do you really want a best friend who gives you ultimatums?|`|H52k20ykaa	ok well i think u shud talk to ur other friends about wat she sed just to let them no how rude she waz to u....dont break up with him. also let him no wat she sed just so if rumors start to spread he will no not to believe them!    o and one more thing if ur friends really dont talk to u again then there not ur real friends!
tUj5LEZyaa	First focusing on friends is the best idea and then eventually you might meet the girl of your dreams if you go somewhere with your friends like clubbing and other things you never know maybe you might have feelings for your friend but i suggest getting friends first|`|128b03f5cbdd1dfaf8b251c808f25c2baa	you try out new things, like if you've never done something extreme before, do it. example, skydiving, bungee-jumping, wall climbing, camping . . . dare yourself. not only you'll have fun, but you'll meet loads of people. don't be afraid to travel/drive and check out new places, or make new friends. not all friends last, but at least they give you a fun time even for a while. dont get stuck in just a certain part in aussie. it's a great country, more on a big one. so roam around- eventually you'll end up with a handful. good luck and be safe, tho!|`|n6lgxa7Xaa	Hey Jori,  Where are you?

40cfed9792172bab06d656f704d86938aa	No, it's not essential.  But I do usually find myself with the ones that are supposed to be good matches.  With others, you may have to work harder at it.  Some personalities just clash.  pp|`|AA11929241	I would say most likely not. Even if you believe horoscopes would have an effect...once you would be married to a sign that might be wrong for you...you couldn't really fix it based on that, because you can't change your sign ( unless by fixing, you mean finding someone new)....      I would say try marriage counseling first, and if that doesn't work...then try your best to part peacefully...especially if children are involved.|`|vfreOmoRaa	Not at all....There are some people who believe in them...but as long as yo comfortable with ur partner horoscopes are all crap.....|`|D2MACoNMaa	no itz not essential.............i dunt believe in dis horoscope match n all...|`|AA10726404	Only if you are aged 12.

She might want to see you...but it's hard for her to make it happen. ( I could be wrong about this of course...but it's just a feeling).      Even still...I don't suggest that you continue to see her unless you know it is ok with her folks...being that you will legally be an adult, and she is not.      Let her know that you are interested in a serious relationship..and ask her if she wants the same. Try not to pressure her into giving the the answer you want..let her decide what she wants or needs now...and above all...make it clear to her that you want her parents to know about the relationship and approve, if they don't already.|`|1a890b6fbc082d906f66fd607580784baa	Sounds great, just don't get caught.  Once you turn 18, the saying goes 15 will get you 20 (years in prison).|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Depending on the state you live in, 14-15 may not just be bad, but illegal!      2-3 years difference doesn't mean much when she's 25 and you're 28, but there is a HUGE difference between a 14 year old and a 17 year old.  Like I said, it can also be illegal and if your relationship becomes physical, you could be charged with statutory rape.  (Note: this has nothing to do with whether the girl gives consent.  At 14-15, she is considered too young to consent to sex or sexual behavior.)    I'm sorry, but if she were my daughter (or you my son) as a responsible parent, I could not approve of this relationship.  You'd be better off finding someone closer to your own age.|`|0K6s4K9Raa	Ok.  This is the deal: When you are that age (17 almost 18), and she is 14 almost 15, the age difference is only going to seem like a lot for a couple of years at most.      What I am saying is that the older you both get, the difference in your ages will actually become smaller with respect to the ratio of your age and the difference between you.      When I was 16, I met my first husband who was 19.  I felt it was the perfect age difference.  And it probably was.  (We are still good friends to this day and I am 46 now).    Another thing to consider is the family situation.  Here's why: If she happens to have really possessive parent(s), and they don't exactly like the idea of her being with a guy who is at the  adult age, the parent could bring charges against you for statuatory (might have spelled that wrong) rape.  I don't know if that varies from state to state here in the usa, but, I live in California and one of my sons friends was with a younger girl (the ages were 18 & 15 also), the mother freaked out and made his life miserable and tried to press charges but her husband stopped her. Anyway...you see the possible problem?    My parents were fine with my situation and even let us get married 3 months short of my 18th birthday.    I know I am going on and on. I don't mean to.      If her parents seem like they are ok with the idea, just be patient.  Be strong, hang in there.  She may only need a little more time for that age gap to close in.     Good luck to you and I wish you well and that you both get together in time and have a great relationship!!    By the way, me and my fiance that I have been with for 4 years (getting married this august), are 9 years apart and loving it.|`|QNTwYVcuaa	Shes too young, if you were in your 20's I would say no big deal but shes still in high school and your about to be graduating...find someone your own age hun!|`|M6EpMJpDaa	its not to bad...i mean my last boyfriend was 20 and im 15...it just depends on how mature the girl is...people shouldnt really care about age as long as the younger one isnt immature and make sure she doesnt lie to her parents about your age...thatll mess things up its not good to lie|`|3vAagWd0aa	As mature as she may seem she is not an adult and you are soon to be, only life experience can make her more mature, and since she is now entering highschool and your leaving, look at all the experiences you had in those years and the growing you did. At her age she is not ready for a serious relationship and you are, I dont think you are a perv i just think you are kids who already think your grown up. You should date around for  while.|`|3f41f6b67dcbcf31431f01a783e57bf0aa	Age does matter when your an adolescent! You're 17 and she's 14 not if something happens sexually then you automatically can service 10yrs in prison for rape or molestation.  It's not something I would think twice about I just wouldn't do it...  There has been way to many incidents here in GA with 4 different boys same age went to jail for having consentual sex with 14/15 yr olds.  Good Luck!|`|8661def80bfd404f175685ab28ab37feaa	Here's the problem: if you two connect and really like each other and it leads to sex, you will have committed statutory rape. Proceed with caution.|`|Sydtlzj9aa	im 19 and 20 next month and im dating a guy thats 26 and 27 in september.. i dont think an age difference is nothing i dont care what people think...     the only problem is that you will be 18 and you could really get introuble with dating someone younger than 18 just because thats like some kind of law and crap.. but if her parents agree than hell GO FOR IT hehe|`|SURr3gf3aa	I think in this situation yes age is a big deal...Usually I think it is not, but she is not mature enough to know if she likes you or not.  Just be her friend for now.  Don't push relationships on her and all that.  And after you are friends for awhile maybe you both will see where your paths may go.  Weather it as a couple or as friends.|`|TrMhgzQ3aa	I don't see the problem with that age difference. Disregard society for it is retarded and doesn't know anything about anything.|`|UZ1WkuSsaa	It is right now, society would label you as a pedophile. But in a few years, when she's 18, it won't make any difference. If you like her, don't move too fast. Take it slow and casually.|`|cBLTFriIaa	Man you are wrong, you knew when you asked this ? that you were out of line! your are about to be 18 yrs. old you need to find a women that can help you adapt to manhood, not someone who still finds interest in dolls!|`|lGSsI0B5aa	I met my ex the week after my 15th birthday, he was exactly (to the day) 3 years older than me, so 18 at the time. We stay together for 6 years, moved in together, got a dog, got engaged. Needless to say he cheated on me in the end and I got rid, but we had some fun times while we were together.    I can't really comment too much as I don't know what she or you are like as people, but I would suggest you stay aware of the fact that she is still only 14 and things that may appeal to you, might not appeal to her, which could be a big factor contributing to the fact that this is likely to not last forever if it does start at all.    Me and my ex grew together as people, lucky for me he was relatively inexperienced for his age and I was relatively mature for mine, so we kind of met in the middle and it worked for, as I say, 6 years. But by the end we both knew that we were still together through habbit, we'd been together throughout our whole growing up period and now we'd grown in to the people we were, we realized we weren't the people we used to be, and not 'made for each other' anymore. I don't regret it, but I'm very pleased it ended when it did, as now I can really live the life I've always known I've wanted.|`|YHaGNPpyaa	i think u r too young yourself buddy dont take any decisions now she is still in a playfull age its not the age to get into serious relationships this is just infactuation if u come out of it  now and think about the same after your teens you will feel laughing at yourself i swear... wait for 4 to 5 years even after that if u have the same feeling towrds her then you can try after that may be you will not like my answer now but this is fact now its time for you to study and get settled in your life  after that u will see many girls who will be more suitable for u than the girl u like now . u like this girl just bcoz you are not exposed to oter better options so read well keep your desires aside for some time

"I don't expect you to say it back, but if i don't get it off my chest i'm going to go insane...I LOVE YOU!"    needless to say he didn't say it back right away, but i felt a million times better after i told him.

If you have been together for a while and feel obligated to that person, they deserve the respect of hearing from the one that they love that it is time to move on.  There is no easy way to go about it...and ultimately someone is going to get hurt.  But when all is said and done and the pain subsides...wouldn't you feel better looking back and knowing that your boyfriend respected you enough to have a face to face with you telling you why it was time to move on rather than saying that he would call...and never hearing from him again.      Also, if times were not so good and problems were getting worse..it was most likely time to move on anyhow.  There are many people out there in this world who will love you and care about you and you may have to go through a few losers to find the potential winner.  In the process it s likely that you will learn alot about yourself as an individual and your strengths and weaknesses as a lover to a potential mate.  Just make sure not to settle...there is always someone out there for everyone.      And, when breaking up it is useful to keep this in mind...you might not be right for each other...but you will be right for "Mr. or Mrs." Right when they come along.|`|AA10246260	If someone is a real jackass I feel they are not worth the words of me saying "I don`t think its working out"...On the other hand if someone did nothing wrong I feel I owe it to them to say it`s over....How to do it????

I mean to say, how 'stoooopid' do you want to be if you 'stuck' out two bad years before he had to say that. It does take two to tango,I know, but you would never have accepted a mutually agreed separation, so he had no choice but to "see you later." and so that's what he said.    At least it has worked. Obviously it is still playing on you a year later. Get a life. Not his, your own. He has gone and is never coming back.    You are not the only one it has ever happened to. You should have known after only one year at the most that this "affair" was not going to work out. Oh, well, you will perhaps next time around.

They charge $50.00 a month or something close to that, but I figure if someone really wants to meet a decent person without all the games go for it.  If someone is willing to pay a monthly fee they must be looking for the real thing as well unlike sites like myspace or chat rooms.. |`|Kp6JYaMAaa	gotta keep lookin, but eventually they will find you when you least expect it
prm1FfyCaa	Dear Ms Baal (The Storm God),    We all have bad thoughts every once in a while. But here is the issue in reality. You are wishing it to rain because you don't like the way your husband's "friend's girlfriend" is acting like a spoiled provocative girl.  But the issue is really that you don't want your husband's friend to want her in his life. Sometimes you need to evaluate what is more important in this situation.    1. How you feel about her and how you see her, or    2. How does he feel about her being in his life?    Most likely if you can not convince him that she is bad for him, then you will have to allow him to learn by his mistakes on his own. Sometimes the relationship last forever. And sometimes it doesn't.  But you did your part in making your feelings known to your friend, concerning the type of woman that she is and that's all you can do.  If your friend doesn't see it your way, then they will never see it your way, until his life goes downhill and he tries to evaluate what happen in his life.  Let him know that you will be there for his support when the time comes and he needs a shoulder. Only then will he realize his mistake.  Unfortunately there are guys out there who only want one thing in there life. It's up to him to decide what that is.  It will be fun for him for a while and when things get tough, he'd wish he hadn't. So don't give up on your friend, just be there when he needs your shoulder afterwards.  Keep being a friend.  |`|k6ufvOzhaa	No, not really.  After all, arn't you caring for the goodwill of the groom?    Hope this helped, and Good luck!!:]    Xoxo,  Meaghan;];]|`|72b6993f9667bd62915efbb06bf7d890aa	that is called jealousy my friend. We all get it. Just try and control it and be happy your friend has found love for himself.|`|oCztXCcSaa	it is mean if she's not bad and you just think that.    but it isn't if she is really slutty and spoilt.  i'll hope it rains too :)    but think of her husband-to-be, would you want his day to be ruined as well? x|`|CB9a6q9Waa	No, but it's your brother's wedding and your brother's choice, not yours.|`|0c6ca298bfb2c525a1855a0052583340aa	Yeah that is pretty mean. A wedding is a wedding. Let them have a day of joy. Would you like it if something unfortunate happened during an event that was important to you? It's bad karma.|`|cXYUxK2caa	Well, depending on where you are, you just might get your wish! Don't worry - you're not a bad person. It's common for people to feel happy, for instance, when a person they like gains weight. |`|KNZr7mQjaa	It is something kinda mean, why not wish for good weather on her wedding bcos any ones wedding is suppose to be the best day of their life. Just wish for bad weather on her honeymoon! j/k that's mean too.|`|VSiVFMiaaa	the fact that the groom said "just another day" is even meaner that what you had to say about her. |`|Lb6RFzlNaa	Not really. it is common for people to wish harm for the people they hate. But it IS kinda mean to do this =P|`|Qtgrd4RPaa	You could may well be the antichrist, yes.........|`|cRwuYzipaa	it is kinda mean, and it sounds like ur a little jealous! it happens to every1, lol|`|cEmI2aQ0aa	NOT!|`|w9bHUZdLaa	I always heard that its good luck for it to rain on your wedding day. so you'd be wishing them good luck then|`|yPqmV2Kqaa	nope.|`|O4dkkqj2aa	I don't know that you're a bad person, it just sounds like you aren't high on his fiancee. That's all.|`|8fT10Lvbaa	you are mean |`|128b03f5cbdd1dfaf8b251c808f25c2baa	at some point, yes. but if you're hoping for the best for your friend, there is not one mean thing about it at all. in fact, you should talk this over with your friend. i mean, we're talking about a lifetime (if possible) here. talk personally.    if he refuses to listen, then just let them be. in the end, if everything turns out as you expected, you'd have the last laugh and you could proudly tell your friend, "I told you so . . ."|`|nbBbRFxbaa	Nah its cool .  Just keep it to your self , because then you might not be invited to any other weddings after this one ...|`|b3zGfYMpaa	Its good that you want this guy to happy since your so close to him, but if this girl hes marrying is what makes him happy than you need to learn to be okay with that. If shes really as awful as you say she is he'll figure it out on his own sooner or later.|`|jF1xH89Caa	No, not at all. You just really care about your friend and his future. My boyfriend's good friend just got married to an awful woman. Nobody in the group likes her. She wears the pants, shirt, jacket in that relationship. He is not allowed to do anything! Since they have been married, we have not seen him. He doesn't come over anymore. Before they were married, he did come over, but could only spend 30 minutes. If any longer, his phone was blowing up. But, he is happy, so nobody says anything. It is his life and if that is how he likes it, you can't do anything about it. Sucks...I know.|`|FknQXMzRaa	 You have a husband and you LOVE HIS FRIEND ?      I think that's the problem right there. And you don't like his gf .. and you wish her harm     I don't think it's a brotherly crush you got on him sounds like something more.    
OxnFnyqPaa	WoW...  You should definitely tell her.  She has the right to know as you are sleeping with her.  Your business is her business.    She might get mad because you lied to her but I think she'll support you.    Good luck and hope this helps! ^__^    PS  Don't forget to tell her!
tFC13Xsgaa	well see a therapist|`|weBvwrloaa	seek counseling or prepare for a divorce. The thought or desire to touch is one thing, to act on it is  wrong and highly inappropriate. You could get nailed for sexual assault.|`|hEFthejvaa	wow you just need to keep it as your private thoughts. there's nothing wrong to think about your sisters jugs but grabbing it is a whole other story. try to concentrate more on your wife. i'm not accusing you but it seems like your relationship with her is not as healthy as it used to be.  think about it.|`|aY3s1B9xaa	Are you in middle school?

Have fun and stay away from boobies that don't belong to your wife or you'll end up in jail - which is were you would belong if you assaulted a woman in this way in real life.

4AwWgUhqaa	Hi     A card is always cute when you are young. As a young male I liked getting a funny rather than a mushy card.     I was in Cairns in Sept which is best time to go as Festival Cairns was underway.     I found this website which may help you keep in touch with you local community.   http://www.cairns.com.au/entertainment/i...    Enjoy your special day.     Owen 31|`|L69jZMXQaa	give him a sexual act
RTNz05ywaa	First, don't ever say she could do better than you. You sound like a very sweet guy, sweeter than most.    Second, if you want to get her attention you have to sweep her off her feet. Make her see you as you are. Find out things she really enjoys and do them with her. For instance, if she loves to skate then take her skating or if she loves to go out to movies take her. You don't have to make it something expensive. Even just going for a walk and talking to her would be good. Do things she likes. Make her feel as if she is the only thing that matters to you. A girl wants to know she is special to her guy. Show her what a sweet guy you can be. That's probably the best thing you can do.  Most important, be there for her. She will come around.     good luck and i hope everything works out for you!|`|YzhYFu0eaa	You can't really change her mind.  She just doesn't like you that way.  She likes you as a friend, and she doesn't want to lose that.  The only thing you can really do is move on.  In most cases it's easier said than done, but if you hang yourself up on that one person you may never learn to move on.|`|E4s5K6smaa	well girl wont what they cant have :) Try and act like u dont wont her, i kno it sound crazy but try it.. make her believe you dont wont her. It will make her wont you :) worth a try good luck|`|HhSUyOs1aa	you wrote it yourself, She is one of your best friend.     I am afraid in this sitaution for her, you are getting the role MR NICE Guy. The nice guy she can cry out with, talking about with.    the big problem is. Girls Do not fall in love with Mr Nice Guys, the want a guy, that goes his own ways, do his stuf, thinking about themselves, instead of being there for her and solving her problems.    You got break out of the role Mr, Nice Guy if you want to be with her. Show her you are you, you are a man, that take care of him selves, do wahtever he want s. Which includes flirting and dating other women.     Yep you heard it, Dating other Women. Why not? right now she is just a friend. It is not gonna push her away, but she will be aware of that she could loose you to someone else. And will not then take you for granted anymore.     Read this article. There is a couple of good tricks you can use    http://girlfriendback.blogspot.com/2009/...
pQBjqMkoaa	i think hes retarded    and he is a drama queen|`|1KajpBdaaa	hes just bein an ***...testingu to see if u loved him? **** you this **** you that wtf is up with that?  i think he should just go **** himself...its not ure fault u didnt do anything wrong u had every right to throw that drink at him|`|afkygHMgaa	You want an honest answer? Here it is: You are being used. This is a guy who is using your phone, having you do his taxes (does he even still work?), having you drive him around, having you buy him Starbucks.....then he talks to you like you are a low class piece of crap. If you want to beg forgiveness to a guy like that, good luck. You KNOW you can do better than a free loader like him who has a temper and bad language towards you. Good luck|`|IQq0wNqQaa	I agree that he is using you. I also think that he is looking for any reason to break up with you. He was trying to piss you off by deleting all your pictures, in hopes that you'd break up with him. Then he decided that you throwing a drink near him was reason enough to end it with you - so he did. Consider yourself lucky. Good riddance, he's trash.|`|ESsQeH8Aaa	I got the feeling you left out some critical information about the conversation in the car.    You JUST communicated that you weren't angry over the deleted pictures and suddenly he's making accusations that this is coming between you guys.  Why would he do that?  You weren't angry over the deletion of the photos... so why did he say, "he can't believe that something like this could come between us"   This makes no sense.   "I'm mad at you for deleting pictures" does NOT translate into "the relationship is over."   Either he's a semi-moron and can't have intelligent conversations with adults, or you left out the detail of what you said/did right before he said that.      I have to admit, I'm leaning toward your leaving out critical details.  After all, what female in her right mind would be dating a moron for 2 years ?    So,  with THAT said, onto the topic of the thrown coffee cup.    Is it unforgivable?  You have to understand, a thrown coffee cup, whether it struck the intended target or not, still constitutes violence.    Personally, if that had been me you just threw a coffee cup at, I'd have turned around and asked you if that had just "slipped" from your hand.  Because accidents do happen.  (but please don't take me for a fool and expect me to believe it was an accident.)   That act of violence, albeit minor, was still a HUGE sign that you are prone to physical altercations.  And if you can't handle the stress of a minor argument without throwing something at me, then what will you be doing when we have a major one?    The law says I cannot hit, strike, push, or impliment like physical acts against your person.   And I have no problem with that.  But by God, what standards I am held to, YOU damn sure will be held accountable to as well.    However, if Mr. Boyfriend is what I think he is, then I HIGHLY doubt any of what I just said was occuring to him.   More likely, he was just simply looking for an excuse to leave you, found one, and blew it up into something "unforgivable".    Give him a couple of days to cool off.  If he doesn't, then you got lucky.  He wasn't worth your time anyway.       If he DOES cool off and come back, you can start counting the days until the relationship ends on a more perament note.   After all, if what you described in your question is even remotely accurate, it's only a matter of time.
r2gonS44aa	No, I don't think you need to break up.       I think you two need seperate friends and lives and maybe you are spending a little too much time together.      She might not be able to tell you what is really bothering her when you say something to her, because she doesn't know whats honestly bothering her.      You two need to have a little jealousy- a little foreplay- a little passion - and stop doing whatever it is that you are doing 24/7.       Because you BOTH seem bored, surprise this girl with a romantic dinner, (Either made or go out) and do something super sweet for her.   Wake her up a little.  If there is nothing else to focus on in a relationship then you start to focus on the little stuff, that doesn't matter.      Buy her a back massage.    put rose pedals in her car    Put sweet notes in her windsheild wipers    FLOWERS,FLOWERS,FLOWERS.    Take her to the pound to play with the dogs        Bring some breath back into what you have, because once the chase is gone, it gets boring.|`|QTjnxatraa	Sounds like she is unsure of what she whats.  She sounds frustrated and angry.  Maybe something is going on at home or with friends that you don't know about.      But you shouldn't have to put up with the stuff either so I would sit her down and tell her to tell you what is going on and take it from there...|`|1hlIzEnTaa	sounds like she's at war with herself! Something might be bothering her that she doesn't want to tell you about, or maybe something you said/did got to her, even though she wont tell you what it is, she's bitter and trying to hold her anger in but ends up lashing out at you instead..expecting you to know why.Straight out ask her what's getting to her. whether it's even you or not!|`|wDG3yQ3Gaa	trust you gut    ...and if at the end of the day you still want to see her or you still think about her     ....and if the time that the two of you spend together when she isn't mad out weighs the times when she is...    ...then you should stay with her.|`|JhvYXbMmaa	You should talk to her before you do break up. If you cant solve it in like  month or two, break up. Its probably the only way you'll both be happy.

He might be saying it because he knows you don't like him as more than a friend..and doesn't want to admit he likes you more than that because he'll feel stupid since it's not mutual.If that's not the case, he may not feel that way about you but simpy feels really comfortable around you and just likes having the pysical relationship|`|gRsuXxkbaa	a drunk  mind speaks a sober mind thought and does a sober minds actions|`|AA11817078	give more details to have a better answer

Come on, cant you see he is only using you? He's using you for what you've got, after he's done with you he doesn't want to be with you, he's just all for the physical being. He is doing this because he is a jerk, you dont deserve this. You deserve better! Move on, and stop talking to this jerk. Find a new person to talk to or something.|`|KxAmrVBfaa	Oh my     Stop talking to him     Just every time he contacts u DONT pick up dont email back dont speak to him every again and he will get the message     You can do so much better!!|`|35274e2053698369bf4a9870b0cdac59aa	He's a jerk.

And he most probably isn't just sleeping with you. Do you really want a STD?|`|gRsuXxkbaa	STOP HAVIN SEX WITH HIM !!!!!! thats how u end it|`|AA10950898	He does this because he's immature and ignorant and is only doing this for his own self gratification.  Don't give in to him.  You are the winner every time you say NO. He will either walk away and try it on someone else or act all huffy in an attempt to sway your decision.  Ignore the loser.|`|Uz6OKwGxaa	Awwww!! thats messsed up!  hes only using u for 1 thing...u should tell him straight up how it is...  dnt let him do that to u n show him ur strong...that u will not giv n..jus stop talkin to him..|`|6X7qTFvhaa	Its your fault he just wanted to hit it come on your 15 that what you get talking to a 19 year old|`|ca3yPJZRaa	I think you should ignore him.Don't reply any of his calls,email,etc.    He`s obviously using you just for sex.    His love is not true.    He has a extreme hunger i.e sex    So after knowing  all this u must know what to do.    Do anything but don`t have sex with him coz he will probably leave u after u have sex with him.|`|wLcZATmKaa	He is using u all he wants is sex|`|JZsPHstqaa	aww this is sad how easy he tricked u into having sex and now he's done with u. should have listened when people say guys just want sex.  he obviously didnt really want to date u bc ur 15 ur relationship would have never been long term in the first place. srry to say but u were just a booty call next time dont be so easily manipulated|`|ZRbTdQ6iaa	Hes just using you for sex|`|qVQlU4uqaa	JUST KICK HIM IN THE NUTS AND SMILE AND SAY, its over honey|`|8oGTduFAaa	that is horrible! some guys are like that, not all.  hes a lot older than you also, he could get in a lot of trouble for having sex with you, but anyways..you really just need to tell him that he needs to stop acting like a little horny school boy and grow up and that you are completely done with him. tell him that you have found a guy that treats you a hundred times better, and the sex is so much better with him becaues he cares..it is lying but obviously hes lying to you to so f*ck him right? good luck, dont put up with that NO ONE deserves that!|`|iWOrlfotaa	um thats easy he did it to you because he knew he could . he is using you for sex so drop him and leave him alone before he gives you something. Hes having sex with someone else. Once every 3 months?? your just a jump off when he cant find it anywhere else. Be a big girl and stand up for yourself. If you dont respect yourself no one will  oh snap I just read your only 15!!! girl you need to close them legs if you cant deal with this mess. It only gets more complicated...|`|VOIxBNTXaa	He is a straight up jerk. There is some guys out there just want to have sex with you and that's all they wanted. He is still probably immature. You know, you have the right to put him in jail right? He's an adult and you're still a minor. He should know better than do this to you. Girl, I know you are still young but you have to learn to be strong. Never ever let them have sex with you so easily or they won't cherish you. You have to be hard to get, at least 1 year of dating or longer. Just forget that asshole. Don't even think about him anymore, stop talking to him. Keep yourself busy and hang out with your girlfriends.|`|m3L6pLBaaa	dang sex predators did he have a van with free candy on the side of it.|`|Otby0xvYaa	U should have been very firm the very first time when he forced u for IT. Now things have gone too far probably u should be away from him.If he doesnt texts u even u dont do not even once in 3 months.Have some diginity within urself girl! We all are there with u for any help any time. Right now what u need to do is HAVE PATIENCE|`|r07mkYWHaa	First off... You need to understand that as much as you want him and have feelings for him, he has none for you. Plain and simple. And he's not going to, ever. He is 19, he has his own life, doing his own thing, and you should be doing the same. Date some one your own age, for the better of your self. All he is doing is knocking your confidence down and making you feel like you shouldn't feel. You are to young and alive to worry about this guy. Your going to miss out on a lot of things if you sit abed worry about him. He will never be what you want him to be.|`|ec4552cc0681df2ba00b4ddc564a7691aa	SWEETIE!! Look at this experience as a way to make you stronger as a person. You have to move on and know that the next predator that does not respect you will not be able to get the upper hand. You can end it by not having sex with him. And technically, it is statutory rape since he is a legal adult. All you have to do is tell your parents and his parents. But do that only if he starts being aggressive. You will move on with a better outlook. You should gain from this situation and never let anyone walk all over you agian!!|`|AA10423276	he was nice to you coz he wanted to trap you in his web of lies and have sex with you. now that he's had you, he's out for more conquests. you're just a member of his imaginary haram now. its very normal and you'll find countless guys in life who'll just want to use you for sex. they'll tell you all kinds of lies to get you to bed with them. the trick is to turn the tables around now that you know that sex is all the men want. DON'T GIVE THEM SEX. and they'll come after you like dogs. they'll be your buddies. they'll bring your flowers and be nice to you TILL YOU HAVE SEX WITH THEM so the thing is that you don't have sex with anyone till you get married. or have no strings attached sex only when you feel horny. that way no one will be able to hurt your feelings. PLAY THE GAME ON YOUR TERMS. galz have lots of power over men. we're all they have on their minds all day all their lives. don't get all weak by having feelings for them. thats what makes us girls weak FEELINGS... have feelings for a dog or a cat or your family or even for the poor people of the world but not for some sex starved guy looking for a hole.   as for this scum bag whoz using you. play with him. tell him you have no feelings left for him and you don't feel like having sex with him coz he's not good in bed. tell him therez something really wrong with his penis and its repulsive and stinky. say it all like you really sympathizing with him. then say no gal will ever want him you feel so sorry for him and then just close all communication.   next time, get to know a guy really well (for like 2 to 5 years) before having any sexual contact. good luck|`|L69jZMXQaa	cut him off|`|N24wkFROaa	2 words:    STATUTORY RAPE.|`|hRRsnfglaa	TIME TO WAKE UP FOR U GET TOO DEEP HE USED U FOR SEX SO JUST REJECT HIM AND WHEN U GET THE CHANCE TO GET HIM BACK U DO IT|`|N1qKXDs2aa	because he only talks to you for one reason.    dont reply to his texts/phone calls/etc|`|8JWH82wLaa	hey r u stupid,is this age to thinkabout sex.if ur parents heared all the nonsense that u done with tat guy.will u think tat they tolerate u.my adive is to u his slap that guy with sleepers.|`|qHMBkLx2aa	sex|`|wXGRJEQCaa	you've become a booty call|`|cl83KGQoaa	He only wants sex    The guy is a total douche lol.    Just tell him to go to hell.      But why would you have sex with him if you dont even go out?|`|YzhYFu0eaa	Most older guys around 19 and older that date teenagers do it for sex.  They do it because they know a lot of younger girls are into older (read: more "mature") guys.|`|cUYunFvHaa	well, never answer his calls, he's a@sshole and a perv, u should not even want to talk to him............|`|X5F7h3l4aa	just using you,why don't you get him back by going to the police and telling him yous had sex and hes charged for having intercourse with a minor.  tell your dad he would go to the police.|`|rSzvXjiqaa	hes a jerk.    u dont want him! hes using u!|`|weBvwrloaa	I think that he did it because he does it to other girls..if you think that you were special, I hate to say that you are not kiddo. You were the goal, he pressured you and you fell to his pressing the issue.He got what he wanted-your virginity and ditched. Now  your the safety net..he knows that you havent been with any one else ( correct?) so he playes upon your feelings for him to get booty when he has the urge. He does not really want to be your friend. He does not want to be your boyfriend.  block his phone number and be strong and cut your ties....he's a waste of your time, your energy and emotions..|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	He's 19 and you're 15 and having sex with him?  He can (and should) go to prison for that.  File statutory rape charges on him.  That will end it immediately.|`|rmC59Zv9aa	he was just using you sorry dear|`|8u0BV5U7aa	Hes obviously just using you for sex. Just stop all communication with him.

All that matters is that you love each other.  Marriage is for life and isn't about the wedding.  My husband proposed to me in hospital after he had had an operation and realised that I really would stand by him through the good times and the bad.  It wasn't a romantic setting but we both just knew we wanted to be with each other forever.

b69f867cd0e8c768ad08a228c35f9b04aa	I'm definitely in the same situation, but I'm starting to sense a little bit of a change for the better. I get the distinct impression from my fiance that his mom took it hard when I came along. Apparently she always wanted him to do stuff where he could meet girls, but when it actually happened, she had a rough time accepting that he was indeed growing up. That definitely added tension between us because it caused her to allegedly say and do things that I saw as completely smothering.    The other issue is that I'm not a natural conversationalist. I try, but I don't know what to say, especially in nerve-wracking situations (and a FMIL certainly qualifies as a nerve-wracking situation!!). :) And I don't think that she'll start a conversation either. So we've been kind of doing that uncomfortable dance for almost four years.    Lately though it's been loosening up a bit. I think she's finally accepting that my fiance is building a life of his own (evidenced by the fact that she stopped guilt-tripping him into making the 3-hour trip there with literally moment's notice....).    And I've been trying really hard to make sure she's in the loop with things that any family member should know about. I try to directly let her know about things going on, rather than rely on my fiance to tell her everything. I really think that's been helping because it's a line of communication directly between us that is open. And it shows that I think enough of her to let her into the things (good and bad) that are going on in our lives. Trust me, that communication is definitely still awkward a lot of times especially in person, but the effort seems to be helping.    With our differences in communication style, who knows if it'll ever be completely comfortable, but I definitely hope so.|`|kLyOacUiaa	i had that problem. she loved me before he proposed then she went crazy lol. (we got engaged after only 4 months) she even talked bad about me to my crazy cousin at my bridal shower! but we've been married over a yr now and it got better. i think she stopped worrying enough to realize we are truly in love and so happy. my advice is to just love your soon to be husband and take good care of him. and even tho its hard give her a call like once a month just to check up. we see our families alot (italians lol) and i think that helped too. and i think kinda just pretend there isnt tension and everything is great and soon it will be. my mother in law still bugs me sometimes but so does my own mother lol|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Maybe you should do more fun things together, like girl stuff.  Give it some time ^-^|`|2k2ZeUwkaa	Im in the same situation, my mother-in-law doesnt really like me either. I reckon its because she is jealous that her son has somebody else in his life that is taking care of him. Now that you are around, he will ask you to do things for him that he would im sure otherwise have asked his mother to do...maybe you just need to explain to her how you feel.Maybe find out what she likes, and surprise her by setting up a date to do that special thing. Its tough, but some mother-in-laws will never change.|`|AA11953643	I'm having trouble with his father (which I scram at yesterday) I guess I couldn't take the build up from soooo long ago that he's created and I've stayed quiet way too long. Either way, I'm the opposite situation from you but before it continues to get more uncomfortable I would say talk to her, maybe invite her to dine & wine, or do something nice for her. Maybe try and find out what is it that makes her uncomfortable (ask your fiance) about you. I mean be straight forward unlike me who let it build up for so long.|`|znq808AKaa	Same here...we just don't click. But I love my father in law!!!!|`|VpCtXEMGaa	I have a sister in law that has hated me since day one. And my mother in law, well she just seems oblivious. My sister in law is a rotten person all around. I would suggest that you go about your business, and don't mind her. If and when she ever comes around, then let her make the first move.     good luck.|`|VO58huGvaa	I can get along with my future mother in law. I'm kind of in a different situation. I try to stay away from her as much as possible, because, well basically she can be a mooch. i don't want to sound rude, she is a very sweet lady, but you give an inch she takes a mile. She is ALWAYS calling me I really does get quite annoying. Seriously she can call you ten times in a min or less. If is don't answer she send out a missing persons report. It's really hard getting along with the in laws especially the mom. You taking her baby boy away from her.    I gues you can sorta be happy you cant sort of get aloing with her rather that her buggin you all the time.   This really happened to me. My fiance and I had been out of twon and got in late, we live like 23 miles from her. Anyways she said god woke her up in the middle of the night and needed to call us to turn of our gas in the house. She did and couldn't get ahold of us. We were wore out and didn't even hear the phone ringing. She took it upon her self to have the police come to our house at 2:00 in the mornignto see if we were ok. my fiance answered the door with an AK in his hands. Ya pretty crazy. We don't really talk much after that.|`|0BhzYXrTaa	Well my future mother in law doesn't like me too well cause im not spanish and it goes against her culture. Also different religons. I hope she'll open up to me and once she sees her grandchildren things will change. Theres always that hope that makes you keep going. Why dont you try making her a special meal? Alot of times mothers might feel threatened their son's wives are taking their place. They might take a friendly signal and turn it into a threat, however this is perfectly normal. I dont think this happens in every cause though. Well i suggest planning different activities with her that you know she enjoys. Maybe spending time alone with her and talking about your differences will smoothen things out. Tell her how much you love her son and care for him, and if you ask him questions about what he did when he was little or funny memories she might open up and realise she had nothing to worry about and her baby's in good hands =D Momma's boy XD|`|zdpp7cubaa	My future mother in law hates me. Okay maybe hate is a strong word, she dislikes me. Her son was her only child and I think she feels I'm taking her baby away. I adore my future father in law and I'm sure he adores me, we will get along fine. I always try to be extremely nice to my future mother in law and go out of my way to keep her informed on things going on with us (the wedding etc), I am not really sure if I'm making progress though...|`|eg7uZjk5aa	You know, some in-laws are set in their own ways.  It will probably take some time for her to get use to you.  Some times it depends on how old they are, or how many daughter-in-laws or son-in-laws they have already had.  So, give the situation a little time.  If this does not help, I would not worry about it.  As long as you and your husband/boyfriend are getting along well and love each other, it should not matter whether she likes you or not.|`|JAdNkzENaa	sooo many people that ive talked to have the same problem as you are describing! if its her problem, let your fiance know about it and have him set her straight. hes the only one who can. good luck!|`|287be9eed813282b97683e4edde034f8aa	You have to realize relationships take time and work to develop.  It doesn't happen overnight.      If you are uncomfortable you can always talk about her son.  Ask questions about his growing up and look at pictures with her.  She will love the fact you show an interest in her family.  Have her teach you how to cook his favorite foods.    Don't shut her out.  As females we tend to tell our own mothers things about our lives, I know I do.  But she is a Mom too, as I am a mom with only a son.  She doesn't need to know everything, just keep her involved.   She is no less a mother by giving birth to a son.  We still have the same hearts and feelings as mother's with daughters.    Personally, I think sometimes our daughter-in-laws look at their hubby's as "theirs".  He is still a son, brother, uncle, cousin.  Almost always they have enough love for everyone.
HI5aBVYgaa	typical snobby high school girl trust me there's a lot of those at my school and I'm in the same grade as you. I think she is not worth it to have your friendship leave her alone and when she tries to come back to you once she realizes popularity and her friends are not evrything! that's when you have to give her the cold sholder for a while cause she has to learn. But if she doesnt come back o well forget her. Let her be surrounded by fakeness.|`|teNUDFtGaa	forget her! if shes going to be a totally different person when shes with other people than forget her .  ask her why shes like that, but don't get mad over her,shes not worth it!|`|sVkSrUqNaa	Sophmore friend|`|uReFjOONaa	forget her|`|5WB2yZUFaa	she's a jerk! i wouldn't even worry about it. you can't control anyone else, so don't let someone control you! and that's exactly what she's doing if you have been mad all day!|`|6GB5P7ojaa	don't mind her. She's just trying to get attention. She's a loser. Forget her and move on and you should really choose well on who you should trust.
u70TaWI5aa	I am sure you will bump into her again if your classes are around the same area. Just let it happen and when it does ask her for her number next time. Cause that way you know you will bump into her again instead of leaving it to chance.|`|e7I0PXBNaa	why not? it might be nice to bump into her again. Sometimes if you leave it alone, it will find its own way tho...good luck!!|`|jNQbVDHSaa	lost chance to ask phone contact. do not leave it toluck next time!|`|qy07K2k5aa	I think you did really well the first time, very impressive. It's an excellent start to getting to know a girl. Perhaps at the end of your next conversation with her, you can ask for her number if you want. Just talk about what you're comfortable with, maybe ask her how she's been or about her opinion on something. Judging from your first conversation with her, I trust that you know what to say to her. Overall, you're doing really great. Good luck to you.|`|tFC13Xsgaa	you should try and bump into her again and ask her out for coffee or something    GOOD LUCK|`|gHHMzAS2aa	just let it happen dude. if its meant to be, it will find a way to be.|`|5d32Q1Craa	Go find her.. get her phone   ..  Don't be over the top about it.. Just tell her you enjoyed the conversation you had and you'd like to talk more :)|`|uReFjOONaa	.|`|O0pYOOpAaa	Dude, be careful. Some of those women give of the signals that they are available, want someone, or just simply want a BF, but the truth may be far from that.    I was in the situation with this girl once where she made eye contact with me. Then we both started flirting, and she was even touching on me. And when I asked her for her phone number, she said that she was engaged. I was 100% flabbergasted. You know that feeling when you get hit in the face with a pillow. Yeah, that's the feeling.    So from then on, when I talk to chicks, within the first 5 minutes I try to find out if 1) she's available or 2) she has a BF. If she does have a BF, then I just talk to her like other random person. If she doesn't then I up the ante by flirting and or I try to get some strategic information on her.    And keep in mind, most girls are scared to approach guys. Only a few elite women have the courage to approach a man like a man approaches a woman.    While you're conversing with them, ask them something like "Oh, does your boyfriend goes out here?" Or something else to that effect. If she says no, ask her  if she has a boyfriend anyways.     If she is unavailable (has a BF, has kids), then find another girl in the vicinity. The most a reasonable guy can get to be with a girl that is already taken is "friends" WITHOUT benefits.    Don't waste your time with the time wasters. Stop them dead in their tracks.|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	congrats. don't let it slip
JhvYXbMmaa	I think he was just having a bad day. Especially if it was just one off day. Say Hi again on a non-stressful day and see what happens, cuz people hardly ever change that fast.     Maybe something happened in his life. You dont always have to assume that youre the cause of your crush's problems, even though it seems that way cuz you pay attention alot. But if he treats you diff. than everyone else, maybe he found out and is weirded out.      GOOD LUCK! =]  I hate tht feeling of not knowing! Hahahh|`|df9a2bc65b9256f2948d5b73efcf40fdaa	He probably doesn't realize what a jerk he's being. The same thing happened to me! What I did is I brought a big bag of candy to school the next day and when he asked for one i just said, "no, you're mean" and he asked how, and i explained to him and he realized he was being a jerk and apologized. i'm a sophomore in high school, so this might work or might not depending on your age. usually if you tell the person they're mean, but not exactly in a rude tone, they will be curious to know what they're doing wrong. if not, just move on. good luck.|`|ad6YgqZlaa	Do the same to him, if he does nothing then I don't think it's going anywhere  but, if he reacts then the chances are he feels the same!    well that's my theory anyway haha  good luck!|`|uReFjOONaa	well i think he liked u than found a new girl|`|Uz6OKwGxaa	act like ur not soo interested.....hes gunna soon wonder why u arent teasing him n sayin hi to him anymore...then he will fill the same way u r feeling now ..n maybe u mite find out if he likes u bak...  cuz if he cares for u he would ask u why u rnt talkin to hm or sumthin  if he duznt care for u hes not gunna say nuthin to u|`|GrhiWC4uaa	It is possible that he may have found and got a girlfriend.It could also be possible that he has a lot on his mind and is having a bad day,It could be possible that he got offended when you called him rude and pretty much made it obvious that you expect him to do something and react to things you do..He may not be in the mood for fun..When it comes to guys?Don't expect too much out of them,(not dissing guys)also some guys can't tell that your flirting...A lot of guys Ive talked to? and i have told them later that i liked them and that i was flirting with them?Said"I had no idea that you were flirting or even liked me.If you liked me,you should have just come out and said it,or told me"Could be many things Hun.Hope i helped you a little bit..|`|J14tPA9Eaa	i think he finally figured out that being nice gets you nothing..|`|PYyUvN05aa	I don't know to be honest.    It's possible he's trying to push you away.  But nice guys usually don't mind too much if girls dig them.    On the other hand...he might just be going through some tough times.  You may want to try getting to know him better.  Hardship can make some people clam up.    Ask around and see if his friends are seeing the same kind of reaction.|`|e427f1751a7fb777857f75ee66d0bf16aa	He probably found out you liked him and wants to find a way to push you away....    Or, he's just a major D-bag. Be happy you found out before dating him, I've had a boyfriend before who lets the D-bag out weeks after dating... At least this guy saved you time.|`|CiEdaoRgaa	every boy has their own internal problem..  it wont last forever..dont worry..  try to keep smiling and one day he would realize how beauty your smile is...|`|6c4D4Ereaa	i bet he likes you and thats why hes acting weird|`|AA10423276	i think he's irritated by your over friendly attitude. i'm sure he knows you have a crush on him and he has no feelings or attraction for you so he's trying to push you away. you should leave him alone or you'll only get more hurt later. he didn't reply when you said hi. so never say hi to him again. even if he comes to you, it'd only be out of pity or he'll have no other gal then he'll use you as a spare tyre. don't let him use you. always go for someone who love you, not for someone you love. your object of desire has some other object of desire.|`|O0pYOOpAaa	I think you may be the cause of this.    He was being nice to you and trying to go forward to you, but you don't respond to his actions and he now resents you for that. He feels hurt, vulnerable, insecure (from being hurt) and so he shows it with anger. Anger, funny, and sex are the only acceptable ways that men can show emotion in most societies.|`|w3MziozHaa	Every girl has been in that situation, at least I have. Sometimes men, young and old go through changes. If he's acting like a jerk constantly, my advice is for you to back off him for a while. If he doesn't tease you, don't try to tease him. Eventually whatever has caused this change will come out. Just don't let him know it bothers you and perhaps he's going through something deep. Give it time before you make a definite decision.|`|Aw1Kd0eRaa	well i think he liked u than found a new girl  im srry|`|ea3ca8a606f94f10e966ec493a06ea18aa	Girl that does sound a little complicated. It could be different things, like if someone told him a lie about you and he believed it. that happened to one of my friends before, Or the really bad thing is he might just like another girl. Most guys like one girl for awhile and then turn around and like someone else. If that's true he will probably start liking you again. Maybe you said something to hurt him. something you have no clue you did. And last one maybe he really likes you he just feels like you don't like him. But anyways If I was you I would just go up to him and ask him why he acts different. He should understand your concern
qHMBkLx2aa	he just wants to get in your pants. Be weary.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Next time he wants you to take a pic with his cell phone, add your phone number and tell him to give you call some time.  See what happens.  If, he really does like you more than a friend, then he will call and ask you out.  Or, if he only likes you as a friend, then you got your answer without totally embarrassing yourself.  Good luck and stay away from the brother!:)|`|NLxcfGplaa	Be brave and ask him, he might say yes|`|J0RJ3MS7aa	why is it taking 23 minutes for the questions to post?|`|jYMlAN4Paa	OK, no one is perfect. We all have flaws, even "sweet" guys.  Don't go by what you hear from others or rumors...they are usually wrong. Trust your instincts. You sound pretty young but eventually you'll start to see the fake ones a mile away. This guy might like you but he picks on you....not sure what you mean by this but picking on someone usually isn't a good thing.    Either ask him to a movie or something tame like that or move on to a nice guy who doesn't hug everyone or pick on you.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I'm pretty sure that he likes you. Your cousin is an "obstacle" to getting the guy.|`|e7I0PXBNaa	it kinda sounds like he likes you. Maybe you should make him realize that you like him.

Most guys tend to send out mixed signals which often makes it really confusing for most girls to figure out whether he likes them or not. You can never be hundred percent sure about whether he likes you or not yet there are certain ways to figure out what he is actually looking for. Read on to discover some of the proven ways to figure out whether he likes you or not.    He would smile at you a lot- When a guy likes you he would tend to smile more than usual when he is looking at you. You can always make out from a guys smile whether he likes you or not just based on the way he smiles. If he passes an invitational smile towards you as if he is willing to have a word than he definitely likes you.    Finds a reason to have a word with you- If a guy likes you than he would find all possible reasons to get in conversation with you and would be willing to get your attention as much as possible. The best way to guess whether he likes you or not is to simply read between his lines. When a guy normally tends to like a girl he would always give small hints within the conversation that he fancies you and would love to go out with you.    Catch his stare- This is probably one of the best ways to figure out whether a guy likes you or not. If he likes you than he would stare at you in a different manner different from how he looks at other people.    He keeps looking- If a guy likes you than he would keep looking towards you even after you have had a word with him. For example he would always keep looking at you even if you pass by him. The best way to find out whether he is looking or not is to simply turn your head around and catch his stare.    Constantly tries to impress you- When a guy tries to impress girl than he definitely likes her. If he is always dressed well around you and tries to present himself in the best of his behavior than he is definitely likes you and is waiting for an indication or signal from your side.      He blushes and sweats. You intimidate him.    He stares at you. (He can be a stalker, beware)    He does things to deliberately gain your attention.    He stutters when he speaks to you.    His pupils dilate when you are up close and you see them... Beware, pupils dilate when it is dim, mostly.    He waits for you. He looks out for you.    He laughs at your jokes when no one else does.    He teases you because he wants you to remember and notice him.    He listens to you and actually remembers little details.    He notices slight changes in your appearance.    He seems sad when you ignore him.    He seems jealous when you are with another guy. Whoo.    His friends all know you when you don't know them.    He smiles back when you smile at him.    He often stares at you and when you catch him, he does that cute head turn, very fast!    He performs sweet acts for you. He defends and protects you. He tolerates you being mean to him.    Signs that he is a player    He is a smooth talker. He is very comfortable around you.    He places his hands on you with ease.    Every other girl likes him.    Just be careful.|`|5d32Q1Craa	Why not try asking him?|`|Swef4RSuaa	Sounds like a flirt,,just ask him if he wants to hang out sometime.|`|KKhc5UiYaa	Tune into the saaame bat time the saaaame bat channel da da da da da da da da BATMAN|`|VOIxBNTXaa	Don't fall for it so fast. If he likes you, he will eventually tell you or ask you out. Those are signs he might be attracted to you or even likes you. Don't listen to your cousin because she doesn't know how he feels unless he told her. You can ask him straight up and see if he likes you or not. Or you can try to not give him any attention, kind of avoid him and see what he do.|`|YfLFmD1Yaa	he loves ya girl go for it hes shy and doesnt want to wreck relationship he allready has with you. tell him you will make his day and yours good luck|`|HumLQPDhaa	Set up a get together with just you two, then as things get comfortable ask him what kind of women he is into.  This will let him know ur interested in him and his response will determine whether he feels the same way or is just into other girls.|`|WfTRGSOdaa	obviously he likes you, he's taking pics of you. i wouldn't take em of a girl i didn't like. just talk to him eventually you'll see his true intentions|`|2u3dkNnZaa	i think he really likes you. pretty much if i guy is always hanging around you and giving you lots of attention then ya he likes you :)|`|KBtDdsNAaa	Ok, i'm a guy, trusy me when i say this, He likes you! Three ways to tell if a guy likes you, 1.Makes fun of you or hit's you just so they can touch you. 2.You can always tell by how the guy looks at you compared to other girl. 3.If they ask you if you like a guy or anything about another guy, we try to see if the girl has anymore guys in the picture b4 we get too involved.|`|AA10828213	idk|`|AZZ0ZisSaa	i think that he seems to be a pretty lax guy and would be a good option to try and confront him with this and actually ask him. i think its cute and very... brave i want to say, to do something like that, and i like that. try that. alot of us guys -without- out heads up our asses hate the beating around the bush stuff. so yea, try that. if he says no, just friends, then its only a deal -if you make it one-. otherwise just say "oh, ok" and go on being friends. and maybe down the road something will happen because you talked to him, it has happened to me, why not you.|`|ijFdgvVCaa	flirt a bit. then after a while ask him out. if he likes u in that way then he'll say yes, if not and he is a sweet guy he'll say no but wont take it badly n you'll still have a friend. don't ever go out with someone you know is a jerk. there's no point.    ?good luck ?|`|6Ei4mn6naa	Just ask him|`|iEtFKecJaa	HECK YEAH! he likes you. I gots a guy like this too. uhm....try asking him. start passing him notes. then in the middle of a conversation in those notes say "hey some peopel have been saying you like me.. do you?" itll work. lol|`|W985NU9Raa	If his brothers a playa don't give up the perfect dude!!!! Ask him out!!!! BElieve me if he says no is not end of world!|`|t1Ve4Nrfaa	I think he has new feelings for you that he's not sure about. my question for you is how long has this behavior been going on??? well i think he does like you and that you should hint or flirt to get his attention. But if your still not sure about how he feels towards you, you should just keep the flirting on the down low. But if you honestly think he likes you from signs (looking at you in the eyes while talking, laughing at every joke you make, and smiling at you etc.) then go for it! but only if your comphortable and if you think he is. you dont want to scare him off.    good luck!   :)|`|dJlVyv4Xaa	yup...he likes you  he enjoys your company  if you want to get his attention..just ask if you'll can hag out or something  it should work  enjoy ur day!|`|We6rY8ynaa	I believe he likes you. He may be nice to everyone but he certainly seems to feel more toward you. I just read this article in Cosmopolitan magazine and some of the signs that a guy is into you are  1.He won't make a move or ask you out. He is most likely nervous about how you will react.  2. He brags non-stop.To try and show you he is worthy he might feel he has to go on and on about how awesome he is. Try shifting the conversation to one of your passions or hobbies-  if he asks a lot of questions he was most likely just trying to impress you.  3.He acts like just a friend. He is working the buddie angle to try to get closer to you. Try touching his arm and see what happens.Flirt a little. For the record this seems to be true in my cases. It is always better to date a friend. Don't believe that it will ruin the friendship - believe me it won't. Good luck!!!!|`|fac182386bafd8dcd7b3cf540294c677aa	Don't be too confused of his actions. Be brave enough to ask him about the things he did, but prepare yourself for his answer. Sometimes we don't get the answer we wish to have..there's always the "good news" and the "bad news"..so just be prepared.    If you can't find the courage to initiate the talk better not think too much of what his actions means and just wait.. be little patient because if he likes you he'll find a way to let you know soon..or maybe a little later if the time is right.    About the him and his brother..well..what I think is..everyone is unique. We're special in our own little way so if his brother is a jerk..it doesn't mean that he 's also a jerk.    Getting him to like you is all up to you..  my advice is, just be yourself..  you don't have to change anything about you specially if the reason of the change is just so he would like you.  wouldn't it be sweeter if he tells you that he likes you...just you...you being your real self... :-)    good luck!
yf0tevyfaa	Seven months is an insanely small amount of time to be talking about marriage and kids. I have been with my boyfriend for almost two years and we talk about it, but we don't plan on it and it's not a serious conversation.    Honesty is best, and do what you think is best for you. It's not a healthy relationship when you stop hanging out with your friends. She seems really clingy. If you want it to work, you can try talking to her first. I say if she doesn't loosen up on you, then it's a deal breaker.    There no sense in not trying to work it out. She may not realize how unreasonable she is being and you may have to point out what she's doing for her to actually see it.    Good luck  (:|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Tell her that you have been cheating on her with a girl that you like besides her.

AA12349214	Oh girly I think the chances, sadly, are that he already has.  2 years you say?   Is he living there permanently?  How do you expect this relationship to actually work if you dont see each other?  I would truly be amazed if this worked out.  If he is a permanent resident there and he still wants to be with you - are you going to emigrate there?  If not - how in heavens name can it work?  I think he will have had 'dates' in all honesty.  This is an almost impossible situation isnt it?|`|chZFmJOPaa	..........2 years? What kind of a relationship is that?|`|ec4552cc0681df2ba00b4ddc564a7691aa	I dont know. If he is good looking, then he will have plenty of options. But if he carries himself modestly, then maybe he is waiting for you. But 2 years is a LOOOONNNG time. Im sure he had his moments. But I doubt he fell in love with someone.|`|r07mkYWHaa	You have to trust your instinct. He will tell you him self indirectly. If you feel something is wrong, it probably is. Talk to him about it in a non accusing way. He may make you more confident or he may give you an answer you don't want to hear. But again. Instinct is always there, you just have to listen. As for possibility that he will find another girl. There would be that possibility even if he lived 5 miles from you. You just have to trust him, if you can't there is your first sign to move on.|`|AA11586439	well, that is possible. but do you think could he do that, given that you've stayed together for two years? you have to ask him this. you have to be honest of your fears to him. This, surely, will bring your relationship to a new level. this is normal for long distance relationship. accept it by talking this over to your bf. good luck! whatever may the answers be, be prepared for it.
ZNh9Rr8faa	sounds like she's not really interested, but I could be wrong.   Sometimes girls love it when guys go after them...actually most girls do.  It's happened to me before a lot, when I would turn a guy down when I'd get asked out, and he would keep trying...and that would turn me on for some reason, and I would change my mind.  So, if you like her, I say call her again.  Don't say oh why didn't you call me back...just say I was wondering how you've been, and I've been thinking about you...definitely say that haha...then say I had fun hanging out with you that day, you wanna hang out again?  If she turns you down, so what, you'll get over it.  Good luck|`|ec4552cc0681df2ba00b4ddc564a7691aa	you never made the connection since 49 minutes is nothing. You are counting on the potential because of the "xoxo." But she also left you to pick up her little sister. Granted that she has obligations, you still did not make any real connection with this girl. Sorry dude. that one is over, but hey....she missed out on YOU bro! I say, date as many girls as possible. At least two at a time.|`|lqrducoqaa	fight so u know u tried ur best hun      xxxxx|`|KBRCOa6vaa	Yeah you don't want to act like you're really into her, do you ever see her in person? If not then I'd say it's over, she has not called you in 2 weeks.|`|x0flaLfUaa	If it was me I'd probably give up the fight honey. However, it is alleged that persistence pays off, maybe you could try one last time? You might as well. Though don't pester her and be prepared, she might not respond and then you'll be back where you started.Oh woe! Why are these things so complicated?|`|KKhc5UiYaa	should i still fight for this girl? is this the end of the road for us? should i move on? or is she just playing hard to get?   Tune into the saaame bat time the saaaame bat channel  da da da da  da da da da  BATMAN|`|GzUBZIqVaa	hmm tell her you got free movie tickets or something if she dont go for it she might not be that into you but if you really like her dont give up call her by accident and wile you got her see if she free to do something
Cf8GBWTkaa	dont listen to females who say "dont look at women as objects". Women look at males as objects. They say things like "he's hot". Dont tolerate double standards. Zero tolerance for double standards.       its not objectifying to recognize a beautiful woman as beautiful.  its just fact.     Can you get one? yes, if you develop a good career. Beautiful women are a little different from average looking ones. They chase guys with money because fact is.... only successful guys can afford to KEEP a woman beautiful as they age.  Women married to poorer guys fade a lot faster than women married to successful guys who can afford quality cosmetics.|`|2EChyy6Kaa	haha nah man|`|AA12190953	I dont think your shallow. I think your honest, most guys feel this way if not all they just dont have the kahunas to say it in mixed company(meaning around women).  Now u said that u r financially stable. But that isnt going to be enough. Your going to have to be loaded. Take Rania Al Abdullah for instance.  She is said to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. Her husband Abdullah Bin Al-Hussein is very short and less than average looking, but it just so happens he was the crown prince of Jordan when they met. And has become king during their marriage So that is the kind of money im referring to.   Or you could become a rock/movie star. Or be like bill gates or paul allen they are both considered goofy looking and bill has a very beautiful wife paul has whatever girl he chooses for that night, but both made alot of money when the came up with windows and formed Microsoft. If you can do any of those types of things your in luck. If not your going to have to lower your standards unless you find a beautiful woman who is blind.|`|YfLFmD1Yaa	keep the dream alive it will happen dont try to hard . be cool love life more money will help women are shalow good luck champ|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	The woman you love, really love, will be hot and beautiful to you.  So it is not impossible.    My experience with some of these super hot ladies, are that they are shallow too. Going for looks only, or money, and not afraid to use men as objects too.    It takes time, finding one that isn`t shallow - so be patient.|`|r8CmwwNiaa	stop looking at women as objects and more like ppl and figure out what you want and what they want|`|hZL62TcUaa	never give up  anyway don't post personal questions like these on this website because you will get laughed at.|`|KKhc5UiYaa	Theres always hot chicks in my dreams and bang em all
qy07K2k5aa	I doubt that you and Dan will have a romantic relationship again. Although you only liked Dan when you two were going out, he knows that in the "build-up" (the crush part), you liked Aaron as well. Hence, he feels insecure, not knowing who you'll go to next. What I feel is that you and Dan can still be friends, but not more. All the best to you.
yf0tevyfaa	I was very independent before I got a boyfriend. I had a full time job and supported myself and was only 17. Now, I don't work at the moment and he has become my best friend. We hang out A LOT, and we both don't mind because we give each other space every once in a while, (we live with eachother).    I recommend planning a day or two to yourself. Explain to her that it would make both of them feel better to have some time to themselves. Let her know that it will be her time to pamper herself and to relax.    She can't be around you forever. If she doesn't agree, use the reverse psychology thing on her.     Cling to her like crazy. Call her all the time, follow her, just annoy the crap out of her. She may get the idea and ask for a day off from you.    When my boyfriend is around me too much, I ask him to leave me alone for a while and that I want some time to pamper myself without his watching eyes.    If she all else fails, then you should just let her know that you can't do it anymore, and that if she doesn't lay off then you will issue a break between you.    Good luck (:|`|chZFmJOPaa	Well I would tell her to relax a bit or you're going to end the relationship. Thats unhealthy.|`|eWtqPufZaa	wow she needs to get a mind of her own. and read the book why men love bitches lol
elVDYy7eaa	Leave it alone, President Clinton!|`|7a00982533df23b16bd49972811d5b7faa	Its your girlfriend, man. Let her keep the shirt cause you don't want to be an indian giver, right?     But get her another gift just because. You know that you're making up for messing the first souvenir up, but she doesn't have to know that...|`|chZFmJOPaa	Lol what she doesnt know, wont hurt her.|`|nFVYFWwRaa	You will probably get it on the shirt again if lucky.|`|HAiGuKIeaa	Dont take it back..    But give her a nice gift..|`|ghUyQEDiaa	I don't think you should feel that bad. At least you washed it, if you hadn't. It'd be a different story. But I think you should do something nice for her anyways, just show her you truly care.|`|Xvec5VyPaa	Oh, so what! As long as she liked the shirt. And besides you washed it, right?  Then, there ya go no big deal.  What you should be feeling guilty about is lying to her and pretending like you bought her the shirt in Vegas as if you were really thinking about her when really you completely forgot.    Anyways if you told her about the semen on the shirt it would make it worse.  If she's happy with it, just let it be.|`|AA10828213	LMFAO!!!|`|8WYFLp1Baa	hahaha, since you washed it you've got nothing to worry about!  what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
KX5ALUzWaa	Hmm, I'm pretty certain I know how she feels :(  Right now you really have to give her space, anything that she wants, let her have it. Things like this are really difficult for both of you but I'm sure you can make things work out in the end.  Time will heal everything, just stay faithful to her and prove to her that your feelings are genuine. Eventually, her trust should build up again. Please dont do anything to knock it down though or she may never learn to trust anyone again.  Good luck x|`|j2cttqpuaa	my current boyfriend waited forever for me to get over my older "significant other" and honestly, im still not.  and i wont ever be fully okay.  however, i did appreciate that he was serious when he said that he would wait.  i've had two or three other guys who said that they would wait and then let go of me not too long after.  I think it's important that you let her know that you'll stick around and wait for her if she needs the break, which by the way you should.  before starting to go out with my current boyfriend, i told him also that i needed to 'clear my head and mind' and he said okay and kept cool and waited until i came back to him ready.  It touched me greatly to know that he was there waiting the whole time and haven't given up on me.  Another thing is, i know you want to let her know that you love her, but sometimes i think it works better if you don't SAY it too often.  because sometimes when my boyfriend tells me he loves me way too many times, i get sick of it, and the worth of those words go down greatly.  i would rather hear them once in a while but him really mean it every time he says them.  It shows much more love in a sense i think.    good luck.. really.. for both you and her.|`|UKLdPLqTaa	I am not a girl but this describes my last two relationships perfectly. If her pain is getting worse then she never got over her last relationship(s). She needs space in order to heal. Let her go. If she gets over it and wants to resume a relationship then it will be better and more healthy than ever, but don't count on it.|`|XnIAEX01aa	take it easy- if you come on too strong she'll just keep pushing you away... maybe its an excuse? she's maybe afraid of commitment?

I think you might have over welcomed your presence with her. you could be too convenient. She could be the type that makes her decisions with her emotions. And assurance that you do love her is too easy for her. She wants the drama. Get her attention by saying "screw you" not cheers.|`|chZFmJOPaa	Personally I think the whole 'Ive been hurt before' crap needs to get lost. Just because someone hurt you before doesnt mean the next person is like that....... shes losing you -a great guy- over a dumbsh!! she dated before.     Thats not fair. I would say to her; I'm not him, and I'm not going to keep hurting myself to convince you of that. Maybe its better if you work on yourself.|`|nYnlQPu1aa	I have been in that situation and it is hard. I wanted that break too and I am good now but I changed the way that I was with people before, even with the boy that I was close with him. Don't leave her in the time that she emotionally need some one just be around but don't push and don't force her to think about it.|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	it does hurt..i was hurt physically..and then he cheated! got the girl pregnant, and married her by the way. so not cool.  it took a while, but when the right guy came along, i just knew i could trust this one guy only!   one thing that told me he really loved me was that he goes down on me really good, like passionately and all. its great, and it just keeps getting better. gifts, and letters are always good too! nothing says it like writing|`|tPlJX0Jmaa	yer she needs time and space but stil let her know you are there she is lucky that you are stickn by her|`|I3lOfq1xaa	okay well first off, you sound really young, by saying you "love" her is where you went wrong. you haven`t been together for very long to be honest, and quite frankly, she knows you don`t really "love" her, it`s just puppy love. sounds like she`s a bit codependent and you should just end it before she gets hurt even more. she probably has been hurt, yeah, by being alone. just my opinion. not trying to be mean :) good luck though|`|AA10353098	Give ur girl space to know you well... and her feelings too.  She should be able to respond  to ur feelings ...... as  she might just hurt you... without realizing it .|`|RINX5KTTaa	Honestly, women are complicated regaurdless the situation, so when you are with a women who has been hurt emtionaly, you have a totally more complicated women. Women who have been hurt emtionaly by a man that they like alot, take that to heart, not all but most women, will fell like all men are the same, and even tho in your case you have done nothing but treat her right, she is scared to get hurt agian.  By her wanting to take a break, is her way of trying to figure out if she is willing to take this chance with you, take the chance of possibly getting hurt.  She wants to figure out who she is as a person.  As a women most importantly.    Now some women use this as an excuse    EXAMPLE:     1)"I am sorry John Tucker, I do care for you, but I need to figure things out so I need to take a break"    WHAT she could be thinking: "I am getting to involved with this man, and I am felling to tied down, therefor I will break this off with him, and contunie on being single and haveing fun"    Make since??    Either way, if you really care for this women and want to show her your effection, the most important thing you can do is tell her,    "I care for you ____ and no matter what your descion is, I will always be here for you.  You mean alot to me, and I understand how you need time to think. I am sorry that any man has ever hurt you. I will do my best to prove to you that I am diffrent, no matter how long it takes. I really love you ___, and I always will."    Or somewhere along those lines, I dont know exactly how you fell so I am sure that is not word for word how you fell, or what you would say    Well good luck!    Let me know if I can be more help

zaSyEcnqaa	My fiance and I got engaged after 2 years and I had to bring it up to him and tell him I wanted to be married and maybe have a family and not date forever. ( he is 42, me 36)     I did not propose... but did tell him if we did not want the same things out of the relationship we would need to part ways as friends. he proposed 4 months later. However, I was ready to part ways as friends if he did not want to go to the next level within a reasonable time.     I think you need to talk to him and perhaps consider a relationship class at church or something because if he has fears, he may project that on to you and not make a good husband.     You need to be true to  yourself,though and if you want different things you may be forced to make some hard decisions.     He is smart, though in saying 2 years of dating is  a good marker. I mean, you need time to get to know each other. Don't rush things, but if things are stalled out, that is another thing. You want to be married and deserve that. If the relationship can ultimately not provide that, you may be forced to make difficult choices. You cannot force someone.     also, when you do being it up, you should not be arguing. You need to be soft and yet firm in your desires for yourself. You will never forgive yourself if you stay in a relationship that cannot provide the security you want.     Good luck.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	18 months in a relationship is not that long!  He'll ask you when he's ready.  Marriage is something you don't rush.  If you guys are happy together, then that's awesome.

6GB5P7ojaa	If your parents don't like it even one bit, then they're not ready to let go of you and leave you out there or they'll think you may not be ready and they might be just protecting you if they don't like it. 18 is a bit young for that but if you think you can live on your own and can provide yourself with necessary things, then you should go if your parents are okay with it. If they're not, just wait for a few years when you've graduated college and have a job ready when you go to wherever you belong.    Maybe you could try California or Florida or any place you think fits your needs.    Good luck!!|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Yes definately.  I'd go.  If it is that important to you, go.  As far as your parents are concerned:  Are they going to financially support your trip?  How are you going to pay for this trip?  Do you have your own money?  You are going to need money.  If they forbid you to go and you still go, they can kick you out of their home.  Are you prepared to move out?  Do you have a place to live?  You still have your senior year at school.  Can you complete school if you have to work to afford a place to live?  Do you plan on going to college?  Are your parents going to pay for your education?  They can change their mind and not give you a dime.      Do you have your trip all planned out? You will need safe roads and places to sleep each night.  You are not just going to wing it, are you?  You have to plan a route, how far you can bike each day, and where that will bring you.  This friend of yours, are they also 18?  How safe do you think you will be?  2 young high school students out on the road.  A lot of times, you might be in the middle of nowhere.  There are a lot of unscrupulous people out there - dangerous people.  How would you protect yourself.  What if you broke down?  Had a major problem with one of the bikes.  Would you expect your parents to come and get you?      I don't mean to be a kill-joy but I don't want you getting hurt.  Your dream of doing this is wonderful.  Just be practical about it.  It's a rough world out there.|`|HI5aBVYgaa	YES PARTY THE HEK OFF!! WOoT WOOt I turn 18 this year too lol good luck! and don't trip about your parents just tell them exactly what you wrote they'll get it and if they don't then tell them you're 18 already.|`|PYyUvN05aa	Well...first, find out:    1. What is it your parents want you to do instead.  Get a job?  Go to college?  You didn't say what you're doing after though I assume from your grades that's in your plan.    2. Can you support yourself financially in the event your parents refuse to fund your cross-country trip?  Have you been working?  How much will the whole trip cost?    3. You don't have to take a crosscountry trip to find your "place." Plenty of adults will tell you they haven't found their permanent "place" in life since everyone's changing homes and traveling so much in the 21st century.    You can for starters move to another state/country.  Come here to California where the weather's nice and the beach babes come out  during the summer.  Apply to some schools.  Some of the best ones are right here.|`|5WB2yZUFaa	you only live once. take this life and make the most of it. you're "young and dumb" as they say and that's perfectly alright, you have every right to be. and yes, you will be an adult and they can't stop you.

And she better be older than 16 because even that's to young.  Her body is still not fully developed and needs time to do so.  If she really does mean so much to you wait longer than just two months.  She needs to really trust you and probably needs to be on birth control too.  My best friend got pregnant her first time and they used a condom.  And she was only 15, and the dad works two jobs and has no time to hang out with his friends who said it was ok to have sex with her after 5 months.  If she wants to have sex, be safe.|`|ijFdgvVCaa	the pain is inevitable. just dont go really hard dont go really fast. dont worry too much about you cuming.  i'm really happy you are not just trying to use her. you'd be the first guy i've ever met or whatever who isn't going after the one thing and it makes me happy there are guys who aren't users. make sure she's really wet before you do anything though because it'll hurt more if she's not. have a romantic night before so she feels even better about doing it.     ??? good luck ???|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	A woman of 20 years is physically prepared by nature, for sexual interactions, and Motherhood. Being a virgin only means she has not  had penis sex. It doesn't mean that the hymen is still intact. In fact it probably isn't. There are many reasons for that such as; inserting tampons, fingers, a masturbating vibrator or other devise, bike riding, horse back riding, and aggressive sports, all could be a reason for a detached hymen.    Even though she has not had sex before, the vagina will easily accept a normal eight inch penis.     Planning ahead will ensure a more carefree "dirty date". Have a bottle of her favorite wine handy, a box of chocolates, three condoms, a tube of KY lubricant,  massage oil and two or three candles.    Now to get her to relax and feel comfortable. Nobody can relax if they're hungry. Sooo Go to a fine restaurant first. Back home, both change into something comfortable, housecoat etc. start at living room with chocolates and a glass of wine or two. Smootch on couch. When things get heated up, it's to the bedroom, light a couple of candles, give her a back, then front massage. She is nude now and so are you, lay beside her kiss, fondle her breasts, kiss her tummy, go down to her virginity with lots of kisses, licking and sucking you will know if she is moist, a sign of success.  Lube her with KY, put on your condom and make some music together.    Good Luck    God Bless|`|qHMBkLx2aa	Period blood makes good lube for the first time.|`|498JdszFaa	Type of condom won't do the trick.    Just take it easy on her, make sure she is fully aroused and use lubricant if necessary. It may still hurt, depends on how thick her hymen is. If you really can't get in because it causes too much pain, she should see her doctor and ask to open her hymen further.  That doesn't happen too often, don't worry, she'll be fine.|`|napgiSmXaa	Hello Stephen,        It's good that you are considering her feelings, however I'm not sure any condom would take away any discomfort, however ensuring that the first time is, in fact, the right right time would I'm sure take away the uncomfortable feeling of nagging doubt.

So she doesn't have to look her son in the face and say, I'm sorry you don't know your daddy, he was just a guy I knew for a while who left me when I told him I was pregnant with you.

You cant go wrong. To make it easier for her warm up the oven if you catch my drift. If you turn her on enough her vaginal muscles will relax and wont be as tense. (ie nibble on ear, kiss the neck, passionate kiss, oral, finger, etc) And make sure you tell her to relax because if shes tense it wont go so smooth for her and it will just be painful.
K1TUT0mZaa	I used to think I would only get a divorce if my husband beat me or cheated on me, but I have found that the thought crosses my mind even without those things happening.    People make mistakes, so why should we have to stay in something if we are not happy?    One reason I think divorce is bad is because we hear it so much and it is rather easy to get a divorce.  The rate is so high right now that it seems like lots of people are choosing that option.  I think that makes people more likely to get a divorce instead of working out minor problems.  Marriage isn't taken as seriously anymore.  Why should it be if you can just get a divorce?    I think if you want to make divorce out to be bad, you could say that a solution would be to educate people better and give them more of a reason not to get married young.  I got married too young and I think part of it was just seeing everyone else getting married and thinking that is what I was supposed to do.  Also, maybe if we heard more about counceling than divorce it wouldn't be so popular.  Celebrities get divorced all the time, divorce lawyers advertise all over...divorce is everywhere.|`|8j70Neqeaa	yes and more in favor of not getting married.|`|JsffWlnEaa	its not bad.why live in stress,fear,upset.|`|d5duruQaaa	i don't believe in divorce, keep the vows.|`|364u9d9vaa	the bible actually says divorce is 'wrong' ... BUT if a marriage is far from being saved, or one of the person's doesn't care to save the marriage, then get a divorce. You only have one life... why waste it being miserable with a person you thought you loved!? People change.. and feelings we had for a person can change and never come back.|`|VutPnEcSaa	Why are you even having this debate?  You can divorce by law and there is not much you can do to change that, so who cares whether I or any body else is in favour of it or not.  I will say this much though to you American guys.  There is no such thing as Alimony (spousal support) in Australia and that is irrelevant of the cause of the marrage breakup. So maybe you should consider moving to OZ (Australia).      I will say at this point though, that if you have have children in a marriage in Australia and you break up, then you still have to support those children untill they are 18 if the wife gets custody (but what guy does not want to support his kids).  If the husband gets custody of the kids then the wife has to pay child support.  If there are no children then neither side pays anything.  Assets are usually split 50/50 under the law even if you have children, so most will just settle out of court.    You guys are still doing it tough in the States with marriage breakups eh?  That's just Archaic.
v1tHjJ3haa	WOW ! what a sitiation you have on your hands. I would say depending on the secret......iether you'll have to take a shot and risk her opening her blah blah blah mouth or you'll have to put up with it.

If you know she'll let out the secret....maybe tell your beastie if you think they can handle it and then let your annoying short friend know about her ticking off attitude (it's all about ME) and then you won't have the extra stress of being having your hands tied behind your back and putting up with her bull n' gossip.

QAwwmDuDaa	I foyu know you want to call then suck it up,if it gets to much eject his *** or hang up the phone.|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	If he's really your friend then I think you should apologize to him because friends are there to help.I can understand some depression around New Years because I get it myself,but you need to let people know that you just need a little time to get right.|`|tAjJWbg5aa	Well if he doesn't understand how you feel then he isn't a very good mate in my eyes. I know how you feel. If you don't feel social then that fine... You shouldn't have to explain to him. He is meant to be your mate not you mother. Maybe you should speak to him. Say something like, how you doing, what you been up to and if he starts arguing. just say ... Look, I don't want to talk. And its up to me weather i want to or not so just back off and put the phone down. You don't need to take orders off him! Anyway. Hope it goes ok, Good look and remember he is your mate not you mom!
Mp0MTuvDaa	all i can think of is the cinema or a restaurant.  anywhere you could just sit and watch a dvd together or just listen to some music?  a beach ! a snow covered beach !!|`|4CsGde1qaa	This is weird, it feels like I answered this question already, but anyway, You say you and him live in the isle of man, right? Well, that is a place I have never been to, and I hardly know about it, but I will assume that the isle of man has local play grounds, movie theater's, animal zoo's, flower gardens, clubs, dance clubs, places that play pool, and cemeteries. You can try any of these places, as I do myself, and it is always fun the things that I and who ever is with me do. Good luck!|`|6vJQduumaa	go to the cinema with him.and after that go to resturant or soemfin.to grab a bite.it will only look  like u guys r just going out to have fun together. :D|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Aren't there a lot of historical and just plain beautiful sites you can show him? How about museums about the origin of the Isle of Man. I bet just walking on tiny High Street won't be boring to him. Don't go to places like cinemas that he could go to anywhere. Show him the uniqueness of where you live.Take him to a restaurant that is off the beaten track and introduce him to local dishes. I wish I could go, it would all be exiting to me and I like small places.
M63kq3AYaa	You should hypothetically be going to school to learn to spell rather than hanging out with a junkie.|`|LDLTjNCraa	I would stay away to be honest, only bad could ever come out of it.|`|8j70Neqeaa	stay away.i have been around the block a few times its a world you dont want to be in.|`|AA11441704	wrong hypothesis|`|n5u3rkV4aa	i am getting the impression it isnt hypothetical!

erhdsNHHaa	Only if you save the conversations, just check your msn settings and make sure you aren't, otherwise they could be saved to a file in your computer.    They can also check your website history in your browser history, but you can clear that by hitting "clear history" (I'm not sure where it is on windows I'm using a mac sorry!)|`|9bdEPcWIaa	If they have "gotomypc" or similar.|`|uReFjOONaa	if you save it|`|5I6ZQUn7aa	they can see what you surf on internet by going to history. for msn, they can see the conversations if you are saving them. and for computer they can see what you are saving by going to local disk. and if they never go on your computer then they won't be able to see anything of the activities that you are doing on your computer.
xumwwW8faa	well, my bf loves giving me head!  its wacked because i honestly think it would be a gross thing to do.  but seriously, he's obsessed with it!    like, anything to do with down there, he loves.    like, we'll be sitting on the couch talking to his MUM and he will try and finger me with her watching!!!    so yeah, i think it musnt be uncommon     LOLLOLLOL|`|dCmSA6r2aa	they are interested in all that makes us different then them most are also fascinated by titties as well|`|BNAzjSO1aa	He is probably feeling the sensation of your vagina sliding over his skin and take the time to savor the feelings it is arousing in him, guys are all different the same as us girls are they all like and enjoy different things.

I now get turned on by watching him ,watching his penis enter me. so just lay back and enjoy it, there is nothing wrong with the view at all.|`|fTxwKBNBaa	He likes to feel that he owns you body and controls it for a while.  As a man it makes him feel stronger and also proves him that you are devoted to him so strongly that you let him become "one" with you.

That's what porn is all about right? Watching it go in and out and in an out, and in an extremely close and clear angle too. I'm sure it's a big turn on for guys.    I'm very curious too...

You must be wanting your boyfriend to be more fixated on looking at you then what's going on down there. I think sometimes guy just don't want to make eye contact. That's what doggy style is for. Just do doggy style but I can tell your the kind of woman who wants to enjoy the overall sexual experience and eye contact! So you must question whether your boyfriend likes your vagina or you more!|`|KKhc5UiYaa	He may not be sure where the hole is at and wants to make sure he gets it in the first time, but i dont really care to watch myself putting it her private area|`|72UNDrwkaa	My boyfriend is the exact same and it seems really strange i would love to know why they like it so much|`|xpv3BUyBaa	I Think it just turns him on.

LOL.    On our wedding night, my husband undressed me from my wedding dress. I thought that was really arousing.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	If it's something you never wear and it would make you feel uncomfortable, then you aren't obliged to go the whole lingerie hog.  Personally, I wear lingerie for me, and not for my spouse.  I think making an effort to wear nice underclothes can help with self-confidence - even if nobody ever realises that under your boring work suit you have flirty stockings and a garter belt on.    The only downside, of course, is that my other half is totally desensitised to my sexy skivvies!|`|JAdNkzENaa	um i think its traditional to wear *tasteful* lingerie on your wedding night - nothing too raunchy - the whole "idea" is that its your first time! not that that is necessarily true ha ha|`|hz9qIMhRaa	OOH, absolutely! I had something different on every night of our honeymoon!|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	After having my very heavy constrictive dress all day long all I wanted to do was get naked!

n5u3rkV4aa	I really love this qestion - have starred it and would give it two stars if i could. I agree that people focus so much on the negatives nowadays, mind you i'm not one to talk cos so do i. I am happy because of the snow, and how my little sisters face lit up when she saw it yesterday in the morning. I got two days off school cos of the snow too - which is obviously great.

There are alot of bad things going on in the world and sometimes it is hard to stay positive...but if u look for the bad that is what u will find, so try to focus on all the good stuff in life. I find it is often the small stuff that makes u happy - like a walk in the park on a beautiful day or your pets being happy to see u when u get home...listening to a fav CD...  i dont have everything i would like to have in life - someone special, lots of money etc but you cant force these things to happen, u only get one shot at life so make the most of it...|`|XLRwtIyWaa	family, friends, hangout with them, shopping and dreaming about my future husband and kids :)|`|OE8r1VtRaa	I love my Boyfriend and when he holds me tight and looks into my eyes, i also look forward to every weekend spending time with his kids.

KPXwwwMMaa	I'm not sure what LDR is... but no, if the girl has stopped talking to you, you should not show up unannounced.     Trust me, I've had friends who have tried similar approaches, and immediately they are seen as stalkers or creeps by showing up places unannounced. Showing up unannounced will only make the situation worse.    Sometimes we don't get an answer as to 'why' someone stops talking to us. You need to look inside and realize that there's nothing wrong with you. It just wasn't meant to happen. And stop worrying about 'why'.    It's unfortunate, but you have to cut your losses and move on.|`|AA11441704	you need to talk, not confront
KPXwwwMMaa	Beware of grapevines. They always misconstrue the truth.     Let your boyfriend go, and learn his life lessons. Even if he has to learn it the hard way. Sometimes that's the best way to learn.

Don't be insecure,Be confident,and Wear boots :]  Seriously...you want a girl that likes/loves you for  exactly what you are,right? -ok. So be exactly who  you are,the right person will pop up when you least  expect it,the more you think about something the   less of a chance it will happen.|`|vAQ9bdBeaa	height doesnt matter in a relationship! you should care more about who the person is and nothing else will matter :)|`|LDfXMfyYaa	damn those 2 girls are hot   who cares wat ppl think bout u?  ur short and ull be for the rest of ur life i am too so what? cant dwell on things u cant change and ull find a girl don worri   how bout hookin me up with ur friends?|`|jNQbVDHSaa	work on your sense of humour. remember danny devito!|`|Cf8GBWTkaa	height doesnt matter at all.......... to a short chick. Short chicks often hook up with short guys. We have a lot of peruvians in my town and they are usually short (shorter than asian guys) and they are always with women.... short women.    But to a taller one, you bet your *** it matters.     Its a known fact that short men and tall women do not have the easiest time on the dating circuit. They have done studies and found tall women are more likely to live alone after 40 than shorter women are after 40. I didnt see a study on males but I would imagine it would be the same but in reverse.    At your height you should be able to seriously hook up with someone around your height or a little taller.    But you are right in your observation. The general pattern of human hookups when it comes to serious relationships that are aiming to be lifetime partnerships is    1) the male is the older one  2) the male is the taller one  The other way around makes most males feel effeminate.   Your eyes dont deceive you. That is the pattern.    But.. look at Tom cruise. He married a taller woman (I think).  Look at danny divito. Didnt he marry someone taller?     So there is exceptions. I think your best bet is to use dating agencies and personal ads. You will be able to target yourself to females who dont mind height easier.|`|8pyOVKcmaa	it depends upon your personality my friend. not height. BE POSITIVE or do something which makes you popular which makes you different & unique, then you're sure to attract attention|`|Do310qvTaa	Lol, i love that last bit... its just, the thing is.. you ARE cute! (which means your attractive... so just take at as a good thing mmk)      And not all girls find tall guys attractive, im a tall girl for my age (175cm) and i've only ever dated guys who were the same/shorter than myself... tall guys just look weird to me.     You need to stop looking around at everyone else, and try not to be so down right un happy about your height... your not even short really... and there are PLENTY of shorter people in the world, and i do mean plenty. So there.
wTYPomqQaa	Im so sorry this happened. I'm so sorry for your loss. You need to stop doubting yourself and saying you cant be the older brother to your younger siblings. Because now you are the older brother if you want to be or not. You dont need to be exactly how your older brother was but you do need to look out for your younger siblings since your parents dont have their stuff together. Im sorry that you never had the chance to say that you were grateful and loved him ,but he knows you do love him and he knows that he helped you out a lot and he was the one that took care of you, he loves you and he knows you love him too no matter what was said during the time when you were mad and said that you hated him, he knows that you dont he knows that you love him and are thankful to him. It seems like your question is not just about your brother but about your family too the only thing i can tell you is that it's your choice if you want to forgive your parents or not it is ultimately your choice... so choose wisely. Forgiving your parents its not about doing a physical action its about letting the past rest and start of fresh. You cant doubt yourself you need to be strong it's alright to be scared but you cant give up on yourself or your siblings every person in your family has a role to fullfill and yours is to be strong and keep it together and not doubt yourself, its your choice if you want to forgive your parents thats your choice if you feel like your not ready then thats alright maybe someday you will be but for now you have just suffered a loss and the only thing you can do is grieve and let your emotions out and then go from there... Im really sorry about your loss and i hope things get better for you...|`|KIFMQ8CIaa	i'm sorry for your loss. death is a part of life. it sounds like you had a great brother. don't try to blame anyone for your brother loss. try instead to be like him i.e. take care of your siblings and parents.  i hope that helps
qRwmWmDBaa	HAHAHA...you have been with her for a year and you haven't been laid....sorry to hear that man.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	you sound like a KNOB thats worse than a pig ..............   if you loved her you would not care about waiting ...and sex does NOT make a relationship =/|`|fTxwKBNBaa	Well.  One day my boyfriend told me why he wanted to have ex with me (we were 16 then)  he told me it was not to satisfy his physical needs but to be as close to me as possible regarding both his soul and his body.  After a while I decided that having sex with him was the right decision for me, and we had it.  After we had sex I realized unlike the way it is being shown in american movies, we did not drift apart, our feelings become more intense and we knew there was another bond between us, holding us together.  Who convinced me in the first place was his words, but also a girl friend of us who was not a virgin made me realize that virginity was not a big deal if you lose it to the one you love.  I believe, you should talk to her and convince her that, your relationship will get only better if you really love each other.  Also please do not believe the people who tell you that no plan of marriage turns into reality when people are 18- your relationship may survive unlike many other peoples...  And one last thing I want to add, if people tell you that if you loved her so much you would not make sex a big deal, do not believe them.  Sex is being shown to the society as some kind of harmful act whereas it is good for many relationships and it strengthen the bonds to see that you are able to give pleasure to someone you love and receive nothing in return.    I hope it helps.|`|X43oNJ9Zaa	if she says no you can't force her in it  you have got to wait till she is ready    be understanding|`|9DQDFiLuaa	make her ready if you love her and she love you make her ready start out first with making out and then little buy little do more even do a half sex you can make love but from outside and little buy little she will be ready for you|`|b82ybE3gaa	I've seen plenty of people who "waited for the right one to marry" and slept with them and things didn't work out. She probably has seen it too. She is NOT ready, I understand your frustration but having sex won't fix the sex problem.    Look at it this way, your dying to have sex while she is ok with not having sex, your a jerk now even tho you don't try to be, weel once you guys do go there, you'll feel ok now that you've gotten some, but then the roles will be reversed, and she will be cranky and may end up resenting  you, is that something you want to live with or deal with by pressuring her or trying to coax her into something she isn't ready for?    if it really does become a serious problem between you two maybe you could ask her to engage in some fourplay, that will probably ease the urge a little.|`|jPcgQoNJaa	I think you should talk to her about it and address her fears, if shes afraid of getting pregnant do some research on what you both as a couple can do to prevent that from happening.No matter what you have to wait until she is ready because you dont want her to regret her decision because then it might end your relationship.|`|WIurOBbDaa	Give her time. Or you can talk to her about it. But DON"T try to force her to do it. If she says no, then it's no. At least until she gets the urge...|`|XLRwtIyWaa	omg.|`|rItaulkDaa	You should give her a time and you shouldn't let it affect you that way. If it is affecting your relationship then maybe sex isn't the only thing coming between you guys. Sex isn't a cure all in fact it usually does nothing more than make things more complicated. Being a guy has nothing to do with it if you let yourself say I'm a guy I have to have sex or I will die you are only feeding into that peer pressure bull that everyone would have you to believe, try to show a little self control and respect for her and if you feel you can't maybe you guys really aren't meant to be together. Let it be special don't let it be cheapened just because you want it so bad you can't wait for her to be ready. Don't pressure her.    edit: Sleven your a pig|`|72UNDrwkaa	She is probably just nervous and that's why she feels that she is not ready yet, you should just talk to her about it, and take things really slow you may just get into in naturally then but if she says no then you should take that answer and not force her because you will only put her off sex more by forcing, i can understand your fustration though|`|iPwcUTHvaa	YOU SELFISH JERK.    If you love her then why is it that all you care about is sex? Isn't kissing and masturbating enough? So what if you're a guy?? That doesn't mean a girl has to lose her virginity just to make YOU happy?! Seriously, stop being a dick and get her some flowers.    xx|`|l1wZEtOeaa	sex wont make your relationship better and you don't need to pressure her into having sex with you. you don't quite sound like a pig now but  honestly if your goin to screw up what sounds like a good relationship with her over sex that would make you a pig.... so just wait till your married, it will be better then anyway.|`|e24xEC5faa	Have you tried to talking to her about how you feel about it? Dont try blame her or anything, just explain how it makes you feel. Also, try getting her side of the story as to why she doesn't feel ready. Perhaps she is really nervious or scared? The best thing you can do is try be patient, understanding and most of all not demanding!  And yeah heaps of people have been making comments about how your a jerk for making it a big deal, but i think its quite normal to be confused by now. Sex is a normal and healthy part of a relationship. Yeah its not more important than caring for one another and things, but it is still important for many people as it is yet another bond between the two of you.   But sex shouldnt make you feel like a "normal guy". There isnt really a norm anymore in regards to sex, tons have it early, tons wait for ages. Just whatever is best for the both of you...|`|7wgoN3Xmaa	as a girl, its so good to hear you havent been pressuring her. but a year, thats awhile. you should tell her how you feel and that it is affecting you ultimately effecting her, but say that you still love her and value her.  good luck buddy|`|r7X7srnHaa	a realtionship goes beyond SEX.....its companionship....frienship.....love....t... lovemaking is special. its a deep unique bonding of souls you cannot rush it....respect her, love her and u will see the importance of not rushing or acting on feelings of lust...

It's really wonderful tat you two haven't rushed into sex, as that has been the downfall of countless relationships. Girls and guys are very different, and she seems like the sexually reserved type, while guys don't tend to be like that. It's great that you've kept your virginity for this long, and I really admire that. What you should really try to do is talk to her gently about it, and not rush her into it. Maybe even cook dinner one night and set a romantic mood, and maybe even give her a massage. Arouse her, and make sure that she's completely ready. Don't rush her into doing something like that because if you do, you're bound to regret it. Believe me, waiting for sex will make in all the better when the time comes. :) I wish you and your girl many years of happiness.
wpi36XBAaa	When its not happening in the bedroom, look to what's happening outside of it.   You may love your husband, but there IS a problem in your relationship that is being reflected in your lack of libido and interest in intimacy.  My guess is his actions make you feel very much like sex is all (the only thing) he wants from you, and my guess is that he genuinely thinks he is showing you how much he loves you. The problem is he's not loving you in the way that makes you feel loved, so he's not getting the kind of loving he wants either. You have different methods of loving, different love languages, and neither is getting what they want from the other.   You may want him to spend time with you (outside of sex), or him to say "I love you" more often, or make romantic gestures, while he thinks that by wanting sex he IS telling you he loves you.  Work on finding out what it is you need from him to feel loved, and then make sure he knows exactly what that is, and that he's willing to do that for you. If you can't do this on your own, between the two of you, relationship counseling may help.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Barb is right, it's what he does outside the bedroom that turns your stomach and makes you not want to be intimate with him.  You really need to communicate to him that the crude jokes and immature, degrading gestures turn you OFF, not on. He needs to grow up and be a man and treat you like a lady,  and not just a piece of @ss!|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	try out a fbuddy and see if you enjoy it then...

WHN5cuGZaa	I also feel the same way sometimes when i bust my @$$ at work and go to school full time and seem to not be apreciated by my peers but really its just stress from probably verything thats going on in your life right now... i feel better when i hang out with my best friend or my family... its always good to get away from your busy life to relax... i also suggest you find somthing you like to do like a hobby painting swimming excercising these help you feel better about yourself and you will see the difference in yourself when around other people.. hope i hlped xD!      Adittional Comments:  Well i can see your problem... You need Family!!!! Everyone needs family wether they admit it or not, you said they have alienated you becuase of religion. I to come from a family with strong religious beliefs and i learned that even thow i did not believe in the same things i would be able to at least let them believe i did. These are just beliefs and you should understand they where brought up to believe in their religion. Thats what i would do if i where you but you could have a very different situation. Now if you can not come to peace with your family(cuase i know there are familys that can drive you crazy) then you need to find somone who can be able to replace that empty place. Who you ask? well there is always somone out there willing to change your life maybe girl/boy friend... or just a friend... sometimes that person might even show up to your door one day....|`|vK2le3WYaa	you should try your local mental health facility.

Maybe part of the problem is that your depression are what is causing your current feelings of alienation. Maybe you can meet some new people online and meet with them and make some new friends to pull you out of your funk. It may sound impossible to find friends online and build them up to a real friendship, but I have done it a few times. My husband is in the navy and we have moved a lot the last three years, but I almost always meet people online when we move. You just have to try your best to put yourself out there. Best of luck!
GpbYrDU6aa	If you have cancer, you generally get a lot of attention, because you could face death soon, so try to spend time with both of them, too, and don't assume she is "picking on her", she just wants the attention that you're too busy to give to her, and as children do, they find it in being naughty.  Sit her aside and tell her you know how she feels and you will try to balance up the scales a bit and treat them both the same, but obviously if you have cancer you need to be aware of your sibling that does.   It is important that you don't leave her out, invite her friends over, to make her see you're trying to treat them both the same, and that having cancer doesn't make you judge them.|`|nBQeSu2faa	It is really hard to say, because the age of these sisters is a big factor in this situation....so maybe if you mentioned their ages..you will get some very helpful answers.|`|2AhcNaBzaa	if she's picking on her because of her cancer take her aside and have a privet talk with her when her sister's not there|`|WPbspwy3aa	. . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__|`|yU7urgLxaa	I know a kid (age 10) who has cancer. his sister (Age 15) argues with him as all siblings do. They have their brother, sister fights on a normal basis. It would seem that they never get along.But, the sister is always there when the boy needs anything. She has always taken up the slack when the parents need help. They still fight, and she still loves her brother. Let it go, your daughter needs normal reactions from her siblings. You shouldn't allow remarks about death or disease, but all else is fair play. When the chips are down, I'll bet on the sister. She will be there for the other.|`|dDZ42kDKaa	I have no sources on which to base this answer, and I think what everyone has said so far is spot on, but - the sister who has cancer might feel a little bit more normal for being picked on. I've never had cancer, but I would imagine she is getting all the attention (understandably,) which might make her uncomfortable. The whole situation must be terrifying for her, and if everyone is suddenly treating her like she is some sort of delicate flower to be treasured, it might be kind of stabilizing to be able to rely on the fact that, no matter how sick she gets, her sister is always going to treat her the same way.|`|XpfGuOcQaa	She is feeling like her sister is getting all this attention due to her illness, and as strange as this sounds, she's jealous (of the attention). Try to spend quality alone time with her too. Spoil her, tell her you love her and that she's very special. Ask her to help her sister with something and then praise her when she does something nice for her sister, saying that you know it's been hard on her and she's such a star, you are so proud of her etc.  She is also afraid of losing her sister, and this is her way of coping. Perhaps also consider a counselor for the whole family?

r07mkYWHaa	If he doesn't feel ready then he shouldn't do it. That sounds like ALOT of crap. Marriage, kids, business, house!!! STOP!! Your going to make a huge mistake. One thing at a time... One step at a time. You have to think about your current situation. What is going to be difficult now, but make things easier in your future. Any one would feel anxiety from this. Should you marry and rent for a while, then save for a business?? If I were you! I would tell him to go on with his plans that he had before you came into the picture and that you aren't going any where. If you wait until his business is booming and you have your house then have kids, its going to be much healthier for every one. Don't rush things. Marriage is a piece of paper, a career lasts forever. You guys don't need to load all of this at once. I would advice him to go back to work, save for your house, get settled in your house, start the business and then have the kids. IF you do it all at once, imagine what hes going to come home to every day. A wife, a crying baby, a mortgage, and trying to keep a business alive. That has disaster written all over it!!!

56683e75fef6be3254d66cec18b08afbaa	From how I understand it, it seems like your sister is victimising herself. She does not believe she will recover, so she gave up on everything she has not tried. I think you can only help you sister when she is not looking at the things she cannot do but the things she can. Which means she has to gain hope or the will to try. This is not going to be easy, but never ever give up ok? Make her eyes bright again, I believe you can. Some suggestions I have are to show her cases worse than her such as kids living in poverty. Show her that those kids are in such harsh conditions but yet they can still be in smiles. So many of them are in pain, malnutrition, they cannot even live past teenage. Or that people die from mild illness such as flu due to having no medical attentions. Or people losing the ones they love in natural disasters. Tell her how much you love her, how your whole world will be devastated if something happens to her. Reinforce the fact that she is lucky to have so many things and so many people. Make her understand that everyone cares about her and she is being selfish to make others worry and the least she can do is to love you back. I hope, by making your sister treasure what she has, she will be more optimistic. I sincerely hope it will work out and your sister will get better ok? (:|`|uCwhWQ9gaa	I'm sure she hears you loud and clear and knows the things your saying are true, maybe she is scared some think if they ignore he situation it will go away, when really that isnt the case.

GRuIq6Igaa	1. this guy is flirting with danger although it is ok if you are in high school.  You are too young to be all serious now.  Playing the field is the best.    2.  if his gf is jealous of all his female friends, then she has a severe insecurity.  She is going to end up breaking his heart and trying to hurt his female friends in the long run.  He would be wise to get out of that relationship.    3.  He is complimenting you etc etc.  Sounds like a player to me.  He only wants to be friends.  You have your own place and that is appealing to him.  Be careful when you let him over.    4.  Your relation is going to get inappropiate eventually.  If he is spending this kind of time with you, think about in the future.  How would you feel if you two became an item, and he started hanging out with another gal ALL the time?  Would you be ok with that?  Would you NOT feel threatened?    5.  Most girls AREN'T plastic.  They just don't know what to do with themselves.  I am real.  Sometimes, my friends get mad at me because I am too straightforward.  I make an effort.  Maybe you could get involved in some stuff with other girls and see if you don't make any friends that way.|`|fac182386bafd8dcd7b3cf540294c677aa	don't get confused...  think...  focus...

77a2234ccdf16e7a688b01032437155daa	These are the standard bases when adolescent  boys brag (or lie) about their sexual conquests. Gentleman don't discuss it. Like all slang, there are variations between high schools. Lots of boys will call oral sex "third base" these days.     Getting to first base is kissing.  Second base is fondling the lady's breasts.  Third base is fondling her crotch.  The final stage is intercourse, but no one says they "hit a home run". They call it  "going all the way" or "scoring", terms you often hear in radio broadcasts of baseball games.|`|AA11860161	1. kiss on lips  2. frenching  3. blowjobs, 69s, etc  4 (or homerun) sex  thats wat i was told|`|AA12092856	shes totally right|`|AA11869770	a long long time ago when i was a teen, the bases were:    1 - kissing   2- touching like chest and such  3- oral, etc  4 - actual intercourse (home run lol)
AA12337052	I don't believe that they hate them. I think that they are just afraid to approach them. I'm sure that if the guy started a conversation with a girl, she would be able to look past it. Many people are afraid that they will say the wrong thing or something because of the way society is today.|`|AA10648513	Thats terrible why would anyone hate someone because they were different I see nothing wrong with a man in a wheel chair|`|AA10673894	Even if it is true, it's a good filter for the shallow girls you don't want to hang out with anyhow...Just make yourself approachable and so some approaching.|`|AA11593964	people are shallow|`|AA11427901	I don't know, it's probably awkward to other people. I don't mind it at all personally.|`|AA10109345	i don't think they hate most guys in wheelchairs nor to guys hate most ladies in wheelchairs i think it could be there not sure of themselves on how to handle the situation a nd they might feel awkward as they want to do the right thing|`|AA10280376	If they are judging a guy by the fact that they are in a wheelchair, that girl is not worth knowing. I judge people by their attitude. One of the coolest guys I know happens to be in a wheelchair.
56d0d2eda3f545e68c5580a9672d3985aa	Definately. If your relationship is a real one and you two trust in each other totally, the race of the two of you should make no difference in the relationship. Your mother might just be worried for you because she might have heard that a guy of a certain race is 'unfaithful' or 'a player' or something like that. If you feel that you can take your relationship and imagine it 10 years from now, or if the relationship is just for fun, the races of the two of you should not matter. Love doesn't have any boundaries, including death and races.|`|AA11184753	You should stay with him!!!The color of his skin shouldn't matter,especially if u love him.|`|4c6b35f986bb080418a6118a64f57a25aa	Touchy, either way will suck. Listening to your mother will make you unhappy cuz you like this guy, and disobeying her will cause alot of trouble at home. You should probably talk it over with your mother. See why its not ok.|`|2a4237fb510264218d50fea8f7fb9f40aa	let me ask you this--is your mom dating him or you? then you should date who ever you want and of love, you shouldn't let anyone run your life. date him someones race has nothing to do with it, everyone's a human we all need love.  if he makes you happy then go ahead and do what your heart is telling u to do...good luck|`|565a84717168aa0944fb20623a3b48ffaa	If i was u i would stick with him! Love is what matters not skin color!|`|AA11518638	You did not say how old you are. If you still live in your Moms house you have to fallow her rules. You should try an talk to her about it. Find out why she dose not like him it may not have any thing to do with his color. But if you love each other so much you can wait for each other.|`|AA12300389	I would keep him cuz you love him and he loves you. Tell your mom it doesn't mater what they look like or what color they are it maters how they are in the inside. If your mom can't see that then i would move out or something like that. Good luck!    P.S. I am sorry your mom is like that.|`|AA11347605	thats hard  u should talk to ur mom and ask her why she wants u to dump him and tell her how u feel  too
AA11381406	First, you should find out whether it was consensual.  Did the servant want to have sex with him, or did she have sex with him because he asked her to and she was afraid of losing her job?  If she was just afraid to say no to him, you should take steps to protect her.    If it was consensual sex, you may have to take steps to protect your brother.  Make sure that he is using a condom to protect against AIDS/HIV.  Also, consider whether the relationship may be too intense for him.  A first sexual relationship can be all-consuming, and to have it with a woman that works in your house and is in a different stage in her life- there's no way it will work out between them, and he has no where to go to escape her presence.  Also, how old is this woman?  I think that if it is a consensual relationship, it is predatory and weird for an older woman to have sex with a 16 year old.  In some places in the United States, this would be considered rape, since he's not old enough to make sound decisions about sex.      Of course, it's your decision.  You don't want to be too controlling and risk that your brother won't confide in you in the future.  But if I were you, I would quietly inform one of my parents, and, without making a big fuss, have them dismiss the woman from your service.|`|AA11607230	I say do nothing and let him enjoy.|`|c242582a867512efc1cda165ce2ed528aa	Congratulate him.

db34f811c378428f8cc4d30df425f493aa	If you choose to get together, keep it absolutely secret!!  Yes, don't even tell your best friends...  Friends take sides in a divorce.  Ex wives and husbands have been known to involve family too, with the dirt of your relationship before a final divorce.  Which in officially, is defined as an affair.  Use the time to get to know each other and bond.  It would be sad for you to risk a friendship for a relationship that no one will accept.|`|AA10672725	I do think you should wait until the divorces are final.  If you both truly feel something for each other, waiting a few months won't make any difference.  You didn't mention if this friendship was the catalyst for the divorces, however.  I know how you feel.  There is this really special woman that is a dear friend of mine, however, I would never attempt to start anything because she is married.  Good luck to you in whatever you decide!|`|af40e450ef533880e279247a81cc934faa	Two good friends getting affair was not wrong ...   both of them known each other very much from their begining...

I congrats for ur good decision.|`|daa1aaa9391006ea5cd02edab898a0ffaa	Yaaa whats the problem with that. But wait whats the rush
AA12299542	Totally irrelevant !!  You are going to marry a man that fits two simple criteria:  (1) One who when he first saw you his jaws dropped and his heart started unexplainably beating faster and...  (2) Of those on whom you caused the effect of (1), it will be the one you admire, then feel fantastic with and complete with and therefore one, among all those dropped jaws, the one  YOU also like.  Addendum:  that guy could be cancer, scorpio, tall, short, soccer lover/hater, rich, poor,  gemini, french, german,  no matter... it is those two 'bits' that will matter. As long as you care for him and his jaws are still dropping occasionally at least,  the pad lock is closed !|`|AA11623677	Do not marry someone over his sign!!! That is just asking for a divorce!  Marry for love!!|`|AA12183008	The sign that you fall in love with, respects you & treats you like a queen, that one!    ;)  There is some significance to these signs...but don't let it rule your life, and future picks, lol.

It is all relative.|`|f63d331d3b4799d231462acd98262646aa	If you are asking these questions about the man you plan to marry, you should probably reconsider.  Basically, you answered your own questions.  Guys are looked at like stupid baffons simply because they are.  (Everyone knows women are smarter).  If putting up with HIS level of laziness and stupidity is getting to be a bit much for you NOW, what are you going to do when you're married?  Get divorced?  You really should put a hold on your nuptuals.  As far as normalcy, Stupid is normal.  Wether you are willing to deal with it from HIM is up to you.
i1rDJY2aaa	Sorry to be so blunt, but if you had been doing your job as a husband, she would not have had to turn to him.

Serve food from the 50's!  Forget the alcohol and cake.  Do punch and cupcakes.    Have your photographer shoot half the wedding in B&W pictures.    Use carnations and roses for your floral arrangements and give your bridesmaids wrist corsages instead of bouquets.    Drive off in a 50's car.    Ask guests to dress in a vintage/retro style.    Serve burgers, shakes, and fries for dinner.
WyCmQBuvaa	I got that a lot from a friend of mine too.  She was doing stupid stuff.  She would ask for my opinion or ask me what I would do and I would tell her.  I would tell her exactly how I felt and not what she wanted to hear.  I think she wanted me to say her behavior was fine, go have fun don't worry about any consequences, etc.   If she was being promiscuous, I'd warn her about pregnancy, AIDS, herpes, etc. not to mention her reputation.  If she was driving around and her license, registration, insurance wasn't up to date, I'd tell her if she gets pulled over she's gonna be in big trouble - not to mention an accident. If she was partying too much and neglecting her responsibilities, I'd tell her she's screwing up.       If this is acting too much like a parent, so be it.  I am being a good friend because I am looking out for her best interest. I don't want anything bad to happen to her.  If you don't want to hear it, don't ask for my opinion.|`|7dPwXcItaa	well just say things like settle down and stuff, make sure you don't say thing like, you're grounded and go to bed and i'm disappointed in you, lol plz awnser mine http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...

y4SUDnpaaa	Tell your dad if he really wanted to keep it a secret from your mother he shouldn't have told you. Tell him he's put you in a position where you have to decide which parent to choose........ if  you tell your mom    you may lose your relationship with him if you don't your mother is going  to find out anyway and be upset because you didn't tell her. Then I would tell him since you have to make a choice, you choose to tell your mother because of her fragile mental state you don't want her hearing it from someone else and because it's the right thing to do. Tell him you would rather he tell her but if he chooses not to you feel you have an obligation to tell her and you do not like keeping secrets from her. . If he gets all upset, remind him if he hadn't told you this would not be an issue. You should strongly urge your mother to go to a mental health Doctor to determine if she should be on antidepressants and to either get a therapist or join a group for newly divorced people.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Its a tough situation, but its probably best if you don't tell your mum.    At the end of the day, your father has no obligation to tell your mother, they are not together anymore.    Leave it between them.

Also tell him to stop being affectionate with your mum when he comes to the house, as this leads her on.|`|JsffWlnEaa	tell your mom.she deserves better than that...|`|sruRVr9Kaa	ur mum sounds better and nicer than ur dad, do what makes her happy, mums are the best|`|iEYBCL1Naa	shes your mum tell her..! duhh!! why you leaving her in the dark, maybe thats why shes so depressed and has anxiety because she cant even trust her own children! ffs!!|`|onbwN4csaa	If they are Divorce.

Then finally become happy.|`|P5GhUEvoaa	My situation almost same here.I'm 16.my dad cheats with other woman and even has a daughter of 1 year old already.What i can say is that just let your dad be the one who tell your mom.We as children cannot do much thing about this.And my parents don't have marriage certificate either.|`|ce8WsyJVaa	do not take the role of the mediator between your parents! I did it and only later realized how wrong I was :( they are the adults and you the the child! they should be able to cope with these things. go and explain your father what he is doing to you with this kind of behaviour. I even dare say he did this on purpose so he would not have to be the one to tell her! you must not allow him to get away with this smoothly. make HIM tell your mom, for the sake of you and your family relationships in the  future.   remember, you are only 17 and you should not be put in a situation like this. make your father realise that!!!  best of luck
TShsb3EXaa	13-14. Its around the time most people start dating.  Things like Sex should come way later like after marriage (My Opinion).    Or do you mean how long after you know someone do you start dating them? Well, get to know that person first and when you are comfortable with them then go on a date.    The thing is I think that before you date someone you should be at least 13 or above cause I just don't get the picture. I don't think boys and girls feel that way before around that age.|`|AQ3QqA5daa	erm....well most people are limited to waiting until they are asked!

Just think..  You are venturing where few boys have gone before.  You are like a special explorer.  You'll eventually write a book about your life and you'll be a famous celebrity.

AA10722993	I think you need to sit him down and discuss this with him.   Just tell him you both need to talk it over and ask him what his complaints are.  Maybe you are doing something that you aren't aware of that irritates him.   The only way to correct anything is to get it out into the open.      If his complaints are unjustified, you will have to decide what you are going to do about it.   It's hard living with another person sometimes, and it will never work if one person is unhappy, so that is why you need to talk about it.       But you need to remain calm no matter what he says.   If he does have complaints that are even partly true, you may get angry, but please try to not show your temper.   Tell him you will have to think about things and then go to your room and just cool down.   Remember that nothing is ever solved with anger.  Good luck.
Mcr4IS6Vaa	You really need to think about what people you hang around with.   But I can't talk about being susceptible to peer pressure, though.  The best suggestion is to go up and talk to him first. That way you will know if he actually wants to go out with you.  Then ask him out and keep it a secret. You don't have to let your other friends know.  The only loophole in this is if you get busted. That's really when it gets messy.  Good luck, though!
Fnsea1sMaa	you could start on like little dates,  then build it up|`|Mcr4IS6Vaa	Well I would love to go to your school. At my school, it's the exact opposite. If you're not going out with someone, people tease you. Unfortunately, I'm not going out with anyone so it makes it a little hard for me.     Just remember that someone living in Queensland (The Strange State?) feels your pain.
CLpBApDnaa	In social situations, she may be ignoring you because (1) she is embarrassed to talk to you in public or (2) she's just not that into you (she doesn't like you that much).     For reason 1, maybe her friends tease her for talking to you. This is totally normal in elementary school. Usually, you outgrow this in high school because soon everyone starts liking the opposite sex. Thus, making it "normal" to like someone. By the time people are in college, they start liking people for their inner qualities; like maturity, humor, or intelligence.    For reason 2, maybe she doesn't like you that much as a boyfriend. This doesn't mean that you're not a great guy. This just means that she's not into you right now. You should concentrate on becoming a better person through friends, activities, etc. Throughout life, there will always be girls that will like you and others that won't. If a girl isn't that into you, I wouldn't waste too much time on her. The problem is that if a girl that isn't that into you were ever to be in a relationship with you, she may want something else after a while and leave.    Just give it time, and you'll find someone else better that really cares for you. Who knows, maybe this girl will mature after a year or two and see that you're a good guy.
eTTkAv9Yaa	I had a 'friend' who got married in Italy last year, she was marrying a millionaire.

That is what they tell me all the time.|`|0ylm04PWaa	A great quality in a man!    lol@Professor|`|qRwmWmDBaa	Girls like gay guys, don't they?|`|GRuIq6Igaa	I do!  I love my man.  He is so strong yet wonderfully sensitive.  I adore him.  He is protective of me and will do whatever he can to protect me.  But he is so sweet and gentle with me.  He treat me like a rare fragile flower.  I love that!|`|3MbCFSjBaa	i like a guy who's sensitive with me...and cares about me... but if it came down to it, He'd kick someones *** lol..and be able to protect me, I think that's super hot and sexy|`|oZVWmSpXaa	yep well i like sensitive guys but they can't be soppy they have to a man aswell.|`|9qAYgH0Kaa	Yes definitely just not to sooky that its to over the top, like don't always cry and stuff|`|oyYlV8xMaa	most do, girls just want you to be sensitive and caring with them but at the same time protective|`|iPwcUTHvaa	Yes, alot.|`|21gAYnhTaa	Gotta be careful with this one.      Women like seeing that men can be sensitive and sweet and compassionate but this is not the same as being a "sensitive guy"- I can't imagine man woman who would find it hot if their man starting crying into their shoulder during a sappy romance than the other way around...      But ultimately and this is true no matter how cliche it is: BE YOURSELF.  This means being comfortable with who you are and not being afraid to really show how much you care- assuming you actually you do.|`|xX6TiBj4aa	no they dont|`|aoODNTeraa	no, i don't like... It's just a waste of time to be with  them
efDvTjJSaa	i dont understand it seems like your goal for going abroad was to for him to study and you did it, he got his degree, and you got by, im sure your goal wasnt to go over him to study and bang get a 6 figure salary straight off the bat give yourselves some credit, its hard to relocate over seas, trust me i did it a year ago, and i still have along way to go, but living on one income while the other studies is even harder, good job, and when you go back home dont worry, things will pick up quick|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	There is really no way to cheer him up,but it sounds like you are giving him moral support and that's a good thing.I'm unemployed right now and my wife will not do anything to help.Where are you baby??|`|JsffWlnEaa	wow,thats hard to say,but at least you have each other...good luck|`|p75ZEmjXaa	Have sex with him and tell him "there is this guy on the internet who I met on YA.  he has a great job and he makes lots of money and has fun, even in bad economic times.  but his wife won't have sex with him, and he doesn't know why".      Then, after you tell him the story about me, you can shake your boobs in his face and bust out laughing, because you have what i don't.    If you two don't have any sex either, then forget what i said, i guess things really stink for you guys.|`|PD1fZV7Aaa	It's very hard for a man when they are struggling to support themselves and the family. My husband got laid off a few years back and he really got depressed. I was constantly trying to tell him How proud I was of him and that everything would be ok. I would tell him we need to just enjoy our time together right now. I would help him hunt for a job. Its hard to watch our loved ones feel so down about themselves especially when WE know they are WORTH a great deal. Just keep telling him everything will work out. Pray for guidance and YOU WILL be helped. God Luck and God Bless.|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	encouragement, humor, sex.  stay proud in him for what he has accomplished.
l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear    He Loves you, but may be he has some problems at his work place, he cannot give them back so he let out his frustration at you. Speak to him may be you can help him solve his problem.|`|AA11441704	could he be bi-polar?|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Sounds like a candidate for a psychiatric evaluation.You should not have to put up with that and I would tell him so.I f he will not do something to correct his attitude then you need to escape because it could get worse.Peoples past are hidden in their subconscious and it could be something that happened to him as a child that makes him like that.|`|umsyPxlEaa	Thats hard. Could be a number of things. Hope it gets better for you.|`|BKjiDrHyaa	I think you hubby got internal problem, especially mental problem. Maybe he is having split personality in him and its very unbalance on him. Of course getting anger is normal for every one but not like this. Try to talk to him and if that doesn't work out than you have to take necessary action to stay away from him for a while, make him understand and realise that you're important for him.     Regards  Saran
5Wr9Mlwoaa	I hate to see such a pretty girl waste time with a loser.    So follow my excellent advice and MOVE ON.    Guys that don't care about seeing their own birth children are a red flag. End of story.|`|fE1KEqCsaa	It might not be his decision to see his kid every 6 months, it depends on the mother as well.    He probably forgets to call you because he's enjoying the time out with his friends, not a lot of people enjoy being with someone 24/7 so just because he goes out with his friends doesn't mean he doesn't want you.    Usually, it takes a lot, and strong feelings for a man to tell someone they love them.     So stop worrying about what he does or you're going to look clingy and needy and no man likes that.|`|ZNqYA6FVaa	tell him to pull his head in if he don't then kick him to the cove. you need to think what if u fall preg to him will he do the same thing to your child and not be apart of it life
a1b7e7748fe864b4bfe2e265ef2514c6aa	Go get a  mirror - have a good honest look at yourself and note your good features as well as noting your good points person wise   Then tell yourself you are every bit as good as the next person and even better than his previous girl for what you are putting up with from him   Go out with some girl friends and have some fun - he is dragging you down into  his depressed state - he is  having fun while you are doing all of the work and using your funds when it suits him   Its time for him to grow up and stop being a user|`|Un9CElCaaa	i can go for any girl that i feel is a good person|`|f55mQq7taa	yes|`|NUYcziH7aa	well i must say you are not over reacting and your reaction is perfectly fine.just don;t pay for his expenses that's your money and you have every rite in this world to spend every penny of it.by paying his expenses you are making him handicapped and going from a very thin girl to sum one totally different can be wired but what you are doing for him no thin girl will ever do that.you are really like a mother to him|`|fc4qv3vPaa	if he shows hes interested, get over your own insecurities and except that he like you however you are.|`|zka26204aa	Size really does not have much to do with it.  Every man's taste is different.  My brother was 6'4", well built and extremely attractive, and he loved obese women, however I did see him date smaller girls too.  If he was bothered by your weight, I doubt that he would have ever dated you.      On the other hand, you are being used for your money, and you need to tell him that either he goes to work, or he moves out.  You should not be disrespected this way.      If he has no ambition to work, your life with him will remain miserable always worrying about bills, and whether or not he loves you because you support him, or if he actually loves you.  Give him one moth to get a job, or move his things out.
NLxcfGplaa	Explain to S why you did that and if she is a true friend she will forgive you. tell her you felt like she didn't care for you as much as her new friends.|`|YWmQKm9eaa	On YM it's easy to just invisible a person. That's why everything should be done in person. Just go to her, pull her aside and tell her everything and look her straight in the eye and don't let her go till she says something and explains it.|`|VVZF3QD5aa	You should explain to her what you was going through when she moved away and when she had new freinds.  Id make her see it from your point of view.    And i'd really apologize and ask for her to forgive you.|`|xWaCmo4Taa	Move Onn..   She F**Ked you over   Your F**Ked Her over     and i think its a bit to late.   butt if your realy want her back only you can think of a way Too do it.   Brin up memeries of What Only You and HER Can remeber :)
QkmoNX2Qaa	Of course.  THats completely normal.  Although, I wouldn't recommend it, it' always ends badly.  They will learn their lesson one day or another.   Revenge always blows back up in ur face, and u can sometimes come off as a b!t*ch to others.  Karma will catch up with him/her. Just u know it.   Sit back and wait.   THe people that hurt u obviously weren't ur friends. Ditch them, find some new ones hu appreciate you for you.    X|`|AA12041870	No.  Revenge is a waste of time and usually makes the delivery person look like an @ss.  If someone wronged you, stay away from them.  Love hurts.  The sooner you realize that, the better off you will be.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	I suppose it does but it's definitely not the right thing to do.  Independence is always the best way to go.|`|DYiQtwMJaa	not necessary|`|qsv4NmbDaa	No, revenge is stupid in a first place. If they done it to you then they will most likely do it to someone else, and that someone else might be the wrong person. Do the right thing let others do what you don't want to. Lets say you do seek revenge then what, you showed them whats up, now what. Does it make you a better person does it make you smarter than them, or does it just put you down to their level?|`|WIurOBbDaa	The guy must have done something seriouse...  Personally, I wouldn't think that you loved him all that much because when you truly love someone and they hurt you, you feel horrible and sad, heartache.|`|vC2waUCeaa	If they were real friends you wouldn't need revenge - if they hurt you that much then move on and find some new ones who won't.|`|nzq7cvFdaa	really yes|`|hQPHoKa5aa	Revenge is a passion which usually takes birth from the lap of prejudice or jealousy (sometimes intentionally and sometimes unintentionally).      The Love is a passion which holds the extreme end of submission.  Its only passion and feeling of Love which sometime make you compromise and forgive ANY misdeed of your beloved, but sometimes when one think that he/she is in love, but in fact he/she is not in love, and that is in fact some sort of lust (of self, ego or sex etc..), it takes you in negative end,  prejudice or jealousy is born and such inner disasters are there.|`|jDOeA6wtaa	revenge is not for friends. if they hurt you, you must talk to them and learn to forgive.|`|Z1d6OqGRaa	NOt all, be cool the day will come ,will realise the fact
35uGFC9qaa	no...he meant like get married and have a family with you ;)|`|BL9CQgcAaa	You know what he says is stupid, how can you do all this sht without financial backing or really high stable income? all very stupid|`|Fnsea1sMaa	nooo he meant like get married and have kids  thats what people mean by starting/becoming a family|`|J6X14hWIaa	no, thats not what he means but it would be better because he means move in together and have sex which is illegal and he would be considered a pedafile.|`|395c377076280782e3d71dbcfe6ad589aa	If you honestly dont know what that means, then you should not have a boyfriend. I mean.....its is just like saying ' I want to live with you' is that difficulet? please.
VlzlPAEwaa	He may be the kind of guy, that thinks this is what it is, and will be after marriage. Some people think of marriage as a contract, not only being faithful, but obedient(i left that part out of my vows), maybe he thinks you are doing your role, and you should have no complaints. Sometimes after getting engaged or married, people thinks the courting, and romance stops..but they ar mislead. When he asks you to do something again, make him do it himself..let him know this is a 50/50 relationship. If he gets bugged out, let him know, as long as he treats you like a roommate, them a roommate relationship this will be. You as a woman better keep some self esteem here, or he will drain you completely. You don't have to be over bearing, but don't be his mother.|`|cGbTJobeaa	So, tell him.  If he isn't meeting your physical and emotional needs, then very lovingly and directly TELL HIM.  Lovingly, not nagging. Men's brains have a mute button for nagging.  And if he doesn't change his behavior, very lovingly and directly tell him again.  And be open to hearing how you can better meet his needs as well.    Give him specific examples of things he is doing and how he can make minor changes to meet your needs better.  Right now, you are setting the pattern for your marriage and relationship.  It is much easier to change things before they are ingrained established patterns.    My husband acted the same way as your fiance when we first got married.  I think he took a lot of things for granted because to him doing certain things is just expected as part of normal routine of living life.  Did you thank your mom growing up every time she braided your hair, drove you to school, bought groceries or cooked dinner?      It took a lot of hard work on my part and both of us had to tweak our own expectations.  Since talking to him about it a half dozen times or so, he is 1000% better about thanking me for cooking dinner, telling me that the house looks nice, telling me often that he loves me, or even reaching out to hold my hand in his while we are watching TV. I no longer need to be acknowledged and thanked every time I unload the dishwasher.|`|m5aenb6qaa	your statement/question has incomplete details. try asking his family members if he's like this at home. or maybe you did a mistake to him that you did not realize before. maybe he's having another girl that you do not know. maybe he's just pressured on his job or the thought of getting married. a lot of questions to be answered by him. try to ask him honestly at the right place, occassion and time. open communication will be the key for both of you.|`|JAdNkzENaa	i think he has simply gotten comfortable in your relationship - it may be a good thing that he is acting this way. i say tell him how you feel NOT in the middle of a fight but maybe when you are hanging out. he might not even know he's doing it. im sure he still loves you =)|`|tWW8X6K4aa	telling him you need counseling is not the best thing to suggest yet. have you tried asking him why he has changed towards you?  it could also be the fact that your "honeymoon" period is over.|`|7dmmgSVfaa	dont be"too good wife" with him.Make him feel your importance in his life.Go little noughty with him and tease him,try out romantic games to turn him on.
HThwnbVtaa	its his way of paying you for the sex as you are a  w h o r e  bag of a prostitute.He dose not love you and that's why he is still going home to his wife. How could anyone love a ugly s k a n k y  prostitute like yourself? Your enough to make anyone with half a brain puke.    EVERYONE this is a troll by the way.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	Ok if your mother is lowlife you should definitely not follow her footsteps. From your writing I gather as though your mother's actions are the gospel and should be taken accordingly. (Not that i believe that gospel). You have very bad character and this man is a player and if he is not getting from his wife he should let her go and after that have relationship with you. You seem to be excited about the little gifts and if that is so, i rest my case.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I have just answered your question about touching your breasts, now this is the rest of the story.. if you dont feel guilty for yourself dont you feel guilty for your husband ? after all y ou are deceiving him big time.  If you want to mess around with your boss then have the decency to tell your husband and let him divorce you.  If you are looking for anything other than disgust, you wont get it from me.  Shame on you.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	I don't have to try and make you feel guilty.    Woman like you and your mother make me sick. What kind of mother lets her daughter use her home for such immoral behaviour.???.....    If he loved you he would be with you. I hope that someone does the same thing to you one day!    What goes around comes around .....you are nothing more than a heartless, selfish, *****.|`|elVDYy7eaa	Ask his wife. She knows him better than you do.|`|AA10461616	He is paying you as he would a prostitute because he loves his wife and is in it only for the sex for you.  You should not look to a cheater like your Mother for advice.  As for his wife not giving him enough as you claim, and that being the reason he strayed, did your mom ever tell you that some men don't associate love with sex?  Meaning he very well could love his wife and not you.  That some men can't be faithful to any one woman, no matter how much he is getting and she is putting out?  If he didn't love his wife, he'd be divorced and married to you.    Do a search on YA! Answers, there are dozens upon dozens of women asking your exact same question- married man, sex, expensive gifts, etc.  He can't give you love and feels guilty for using you for sex so he pays for it to ease his guilt.  Think of the really expensive things his wife is getting, besides his name and half of all of his assets of course.    Better yet, after reading all of your lies on the other questions, do a search fro a psychologist to find out what is wrong with you that you need attention from strangers and to make up storied about married men.  I feel sorry for your real mother.|`|yM7YPmzSaa	I thought you were 39 and baron???    where's your 24 year old husband???|`|9bdEPcWIaa	He is buying sex|`|Midbg5BJaa	He's absolving himself of guilt by purchasing your affections.|`|iEYBCL1Naa	at the end of the day hes still married to her and not you.     shes the one he goes home to every night. :-) your in a loss.     affairs like this of any type are wrong. if he truly wants to be with you there would be no need to hide it from his wife or anyone. hes using you and you just cant see that.     your wasting your time. imagine how many other of his employees hes done this to? your probably not the first?|`|AA11587827	i agree with Peggy s|`|AA11996507	He is paying you for services rendered.  Ask your mum, maybe she has some experience in that particular profession too.|`|1kfeghDDaa	Isn't that where the payment is usually left??    Try this...tell your lover, the man that you adore...the one that loves you... to leave at once his horrible, detestable wife right away....and then wait for him to come to your "mums" house with his suitcase. Do tell when he moves in won't you?    Married me who cheat are only out for themselves, they are liars preying on the weakest as they too are WEAK and lack moral character!! Their wife could be the bee's knees and he'd still go after an EASY target. Please let me know when the wedding date for you two is set...I'd be more than happy to send you a gift. :)|`|AA11706291	Because in your eyes you are a prostitute. Now stop making up questions and go and get a life.|`|zka26204aa	Because he is treating you like a prostitute that you are acting like.  One day when you find a husband, if you can, and he cheats I want you to remember what you did.  Remember that what goes around, comes back around and you will get your heartache too.    Men do not cheat because their wives are not giving them enough.  They cheat because they are selfish and want variety, or because they like the excitement of being able to cheat and get by with it.  Your mother is wrong.|`|BKjiDrHyaa	Hi there,     Please don't let your self down, don't you think that your mum is making mistake and you need to follow the same step which she did. You still 24 and you've got lots of oppurtunity outside with good and better guys, why should you have to be with married guy and i can sure you married guys are much more good pretenders than the single one. Make your self out, try it out and don't confused your self. Your mum didn't think about your future, if she really things about it she won't let you in this situation.     Better get rid of him and shape your self.     Regards  Saran|`|SzznKScoaa	He only wants you for sex. You are with someone else's man. Why? You will never get or have the things his wife has. He will say and do anything to keep you head-over-heels for him. How do you know what she is and is not giving him? All you know is what he tells you!|`|XxUsLqXRaa	He buys you expensive gifts as a way to keep you around, and keep you quiet.  I once dated a married man and thought the same thing---"If his wife were keeping him happy, he wouldn't have to stray".  I spent 7 years waiting on him to leave that "unhappy" marriage and spend the rest of his life with me.  Although I was pretty sure I was doing my best to make him happy, he still evidently wasn't because he took on a second mistress.  He still lived with his wife and never spent a night away from her....which meant (in the whole 7 years) he never spend a single night with me.  Anyway, that was almost 20 years ago and, surprise surprise, he's STILL married and living with the same wife.  His kids have long-since grown up and moved out so that blows his excuse that he didn't want to leave her because he'd have to pay child support.  I tried to feel validated about the affair by telling myself the same thing you do....about how he wouldn't stray if only SHE were doing a proper job at being a wife.  Well, I KNEW I was doing all I could to make him happy but it still wasn't enough, so after I found out about the second mistress, I broke it off with him.  I know through mutual acquaintances that he's still married to his wife.  How stupid was I?  If he was REALLY so unhappy and not being fulfilled by her, there's no way he'd still be married 20 years later.  They even bought a new house together after the kids moved out.  I've long-since moved on and married a wonderful man so I dont dwell on it, but it truly IS a past mistake that I wished I hadnt made.  My Mom did NOT condone the relationship, as your does.  Obviously your Mom is biased because she has had affairs herself and believes the same story about how miserable he must be with his wife.  You'll figure it out in about 7 years when he still hasnt left his wife.|`|BKw7Ny1Gaa	don't even go there you can never trust a married man hes only after your body darling and im a dad with two lovely daughters aged 23 and 25 neil|`|lIO4uiJmaa	he his cheating because at present, he can get away it with and you are offering it on a plate to him The fact that he just leaves them on the locker rather than giving them to you says it all - he is simply buying you. if he saw a prostitute he would simply leave the money on the side I am sure, and that is what he is doing with you    But you do really want to sleep with a man, who climbs from his wife's bed, into yours and back into his wife's ?    You need to ask yourself, do you really want to end up with a man who would cheat on you and tell the other woman its because you did this or didn't do that for him.    Your mother is also to blaime - why on earth can't  you find your own men, why do you want to have part share of someone's ?  Maybe its you that don't want anything more than sex|`|PD1fZV7Aaa	Well if he really LOVED you then he would leave her. PLAIN AND SIMPLE.  Do her a favor and tell her you enjoy having her husband once a week SEXUALLY and see where that gets you. I bet he will still stay with his wife and dump you.|`|onbwN4csaa	You woman are a home wrecker...  With out guilt. There's no heart. With out a heart.  You can't love..  You've shown that by what your doing.|`|6k3mwKthaa	You and your mum are utterly despicable, but you knew that already didn't you? I suggest you get yourself a new job, where your boss is married and 80+ years old.|`|PwRNvAJmaa	The apple never falls far from the tree does it, maybe your mum fancies him too and will have an affair with him thats why she is so behind you.|`|rp46MQKeaa	Sorry to say this but; you are acting as a prostitute and your mother is no better than a madam.  You should give your lover an ultimatum to leave his wife and family not to live with you but on his own for a while, give him a month to do this, if he does this he is yours if he doesnt then back off.  I just hope that one day you will not find yourself in the wronged wifes shoes.
cGCYQILoaa	Hello,      First of all you don't know this particular boy how he behaves in these situations. Second the time you spend with him without talking is not a good idea. When you were with him he probably was expecting some talk. It did not happened. From what you said you two know each other for 3-6 months, understand, no one gets married by knowing another person for 3-6 months. Now the question is how to get him back. It is not easy, what you need to make him feel is how important you are to him. For that you need to just shut all contacts with him for at least 2 weeks and know what is going on and then decide what to do. It is not easy as I said earlier... but find reasons to be together than follow dreams and passions. Once you know the reasons think about it and make sure life with him makes you feel important as equals.     Hope this helps.   May God Smile Upon You Always.
eqEae97raa	You've been fantasizing about another guy'sgirl? Shame on you!!!   Well, seriously, I guess you will just have to ride out this storm until it blows over.....not much you can do since she is already taken!    Can't you shake it out of your head? Can't you dream of somebody single? What's the matter with you? Do you enjoy being the 3rd wheel? Get a grip on yourself and burn her out of your memory!    Don't settle for longing after a girl who may never be yours....but free yourself from your adoration! There are other girlsout there if you would only open up your eyes!!!|`|fac182386bafd8dcd7b3cf540294c677aa	I can't say when you will stop thinking of her...nobody knows for sure when that time will happen..even you..you can't tell. It's a process everyone goes in after a relationship.    I think you would make your situation more complicated if you try to get into her classes just to see her. If she's done that to you..don't do the same if you want to really really forget her. Well we can't stop her from popping to places where you are so it will be a difficult process to forget..but if you put a conscious effort of just continue living your life without her..you'll forget her..in time. also engaging yourself to activities you've never done before might help a bit just to divert your mind to other things. Know your priority and start from that...get busy and be a new you.     If you're really made for each other..only time can tell..and if not..  you'll find someone better...just don't rush into things..
0VBESmFQaa	Making money because even if you have no friends you will have no issues meeting new people because you will have the money to go out and meet new people|`|d5zEYomEaa	I think ideally it is making friends because they will help you in priceless ways - being there when you need them, things money can't buy, things that create memories and are the reasons why we are living in the first place. But in reality, we can't have friends and do the things we want, be with the people we want to be with, without making money. So in order to have friends, we ahve to make money, and therefore I would conclude that money is more important (in order to have friends). Friends can't pay your bills and feed you unless you want to mooch off of them. The best scenerio is to lower your expenditures and live modestly so you don't have to depend so much on money and can have more time for friends.|`|QPheve7faa	Making friends with money =)|`|09plg6Kiaa	I guess both are important. Because as for me, you could hardly live without both. Why choose when you can have and make both at the same time?|`|2XTkSV4daa	Making friends is more important than making money for so many reasons, not the least is that what's the fun in having money if you don't have anybody to share it with! You can relax and share problems with your friends whereas the only thing you can do with money is buy stuff with it. Since I spend most of my money on hanging out with friends and food for all of us, I wouldn't know what to do. haha|`|we9fboGyaa	Both are important. Making money is important in terms of taking care of financial responsibilities, providing for family etc. There is nothing at all wrong with being wealthy. Money is not the issue. It's what you do with your money that matters. To say it is more important to make money than to make friends would be wrong. It's relative to your situation and circumstances. Ultimately making friends is more important in terms of eternity.|`|lrOzKrDgaa	MAKING FRIENDS IS MORE IMPORTANT.THEY ADD FLAVOUR TO YOUR LIFE AND GIVE YOU REAL HAPPYNESS. ONE GOOD FRIEND IS VERY NECESSARY IN ONE'S LIFE.|`|XoiKGZstaa	There is all the money in the world that you could have, but friends have no price because they are not worth all the money in the world.    Friends get you everywhere, from getting a job to meeting new people and the feeling that you are worthy in your life and money has no ability in that. Sure money makes you happy but that's short term and it never last forever but friendship is longterm and will last your whole lifetime and money can never to that.
3HhhHWd4aa	Listen to me very carefully boy...    Keep staying close to her, but don't kiss her again.  This will make her feel unwanted and she will want to kiss you more-and-more as time goes by.  Wait for her to get desperate.  Then you should makeout with her again.    I am saying: do not touch her for a two-straight weeks.  Just keep her close by.    Trust me.|`|X5F7h3l4aa	yeah you could wait but what if she starts liking some other guy|`|A71U6gNtaa	i earned two points|`|Midbg5BJaa	Listen to human (poster  1) he knows what he's talking about ;)|`|395c377076280782e3d71dbcfe6ad589aa	Two possibilities: She might have felt like she gave in too fast and so wants to play hard to get....(17 yr olds would do like that). Or maybe she just didnt enjoy the kissing????|`|ijFdgvVCaa	no i'd say she doesnt want to have sex with you yet and feels that if she makes out with you or something she might get you arroused then you'll be angry if you didn't get any. either that or maybe she wants it to go back to friendship but doesnt want to say it in case it upsets you then she doesn't have the friendship either. you should ask her but be careful how you say it because it could upset her if you say it wrong.    ? good luck i hope everything works out ?|`|35uGFC9qaa	maybe she just wants to take thing slowly since you guys are just "new" in the relationship.|`|diGsA3isaa	i agree with the first person|`|ej2JZRMjaa	hmmm... i don't think there's a problem.  what happened is, that you guys got caught up in the moment the first time around.  now she knows that she need a little bit more time into the relationship to be able to open up.|`|Wn9pVR1raa	m8 I've had alot of experiance with women and i can tell you right now shes confused, most proably still not over her ex. My advice would be to kick her to the kerb immediatly!     But i was 18 once and we both know you wont do that :) lol so here's what you do:-    1. Give her, her space.    2. Don't fone, txt or pester her in anyway as she will think your preasuring her.    3. Be civil and when you run in to her be polite and Restrain for trying to kiss her as she will take that you dont respect her wishes.    4. Go out with m8s have fun, their are pleanty of clubs and bars! Get numbers for birds!    5. Never put your self down as you carry a little extra weight, listern to me when i say that it's personality and confidence that turns women on!
ocZRwW7waa	take some time to get used to the school before you decide that everyone at the school has nothing in common with you.  i can guarantee that there is some one who has similar interests to you. it will take time though to get to know people.    just be yourself and make an effort to get to know people. if they aren't and ideal friend for you that's ok but don't get upset. if you keep making and effort your bound to find someone.    you are probably really missing your old school and that's very normal but you should settle in eventually whether it takes 1 week to a month.    remember every ones different and friends come in all shapes and   sizes. so you may not have the same interests but you can still be great friends.    hope it helps :)  and please vote me as best answer XD|`|J7VjaHW6aa	aww hun. have you told your parents how you feel? I know its hard, but they'd want to know. It's hard not fitting in and sometimes it's the outside that has to make the effort. Is there any clubs you can attend at lunch's just to try and get to know a few more people. Maybe even you teachers or the school nurse might be able to help. Don't cry over it, i know feel pretty darn rotten but just remember you won;t be at school forever! and once you've left you can forge your owen path in life and meet new people who are willing to spend time and have fun with you!!!! Good Luck! xx|`|PTdrapBjaa	Give it some time, there must be some people you haven't met yet. The chances are that there will be some people there who you can relate to|`|YWmQKm9eaa	It's always like that with a new environment. Tell your parents and maybe they'll transfer you back. I'm sure they'll understand. Just chill out at the new school for a bit.
89ZS7Exgaa	Well...it doesn't sound good, but I would not say it is doomed quite yet. However, your husband, based on your side of the story alone, is not meeting his end of the marital agreement. He needs to put YOU first, even if it means aggravating his mother/grandmother what have you. They do not want you at that house, so you living there is not an option. So, he needs to either be living at your dad's house with you or in another house with you that is convenient for the two of you. Simple as that. Trust me, if this is not solved now, it will only get worse...especially if kids and property get involved. -Rich|`|BKjiDrHyaa	First of all talk to him and make him understand that you're important to him and how much you loved him and both of you need a house which is really convenient for your hubby and at the same time you'll be with him. Ask him to get a rental house which is within your budget and explain to him that this will be temporarily for 1 or 2 years until things get rite between both of you and at the same time savings needed.     About your mother - in - law, you need to explain to him that you need to be with him as a wife and take care of him, give him the sound of love so that he really comfortable with you.     The most important is your hubby need to take a positive action in this matters. He must understand the his role as a husband especially comes to wife's feelings . I'm sure he would understand.     Regards  Saran|`|BItkg1f0aa	you guys need your own place...you get a job also and get an apartment, if you are married you shouldnt be living with parents|`|y4SUDnpaaa	I think it is ridiculous. What reason did he give you for why you couldn't go with him. You said his nan's house was fairly large and you've lived there before so there has to be some reason he  didn't'  want you to move back when he did. You need to try to talk to him privately and demand some real answers about what's going on. Ask him straight out is this supposed to a separation. If you're not satisfied with his answers suggest marriage counseling. If he refuses to go if I were you I would move back to my dad's house, if you aren't going to live with him you might as well live somewhere with people who love you. I hope I am wrong but sometimes men are just plain cowards when it comes to telling their wives they want out of the marriage.They do stupid things until the wife has enough and wants out of the marriage and then they can blame her.|`|iEYBCL1Naa	Talk to him. not us. hes your husband its your life and you have to work through it together. try and get on with your mother in law there shouldnt be any rifts in any marriage. good luck.|`|bK3QKhEfaa	Jeremy Kyle show ;)|`|zka26204aa	Tell your husband that if he wants to remain married to you, he will be with you every night.  Tell him that if you wanted a bf, you would not have gotten married.  Tell him that you are tired of acting like children and it is time for you and he to be on your own.  Tell him that if he loves you, he will make sure that it happens, even if he has to get a second job.  If he was old enough to get married, he should be old enough to take care of his wife.  You need to work also to help make this happen.|`|GSzQWlccaa	Well you need an ally to tell your man to stop being selfish, and a marriage councellor or an aunt of his. its not clear what was his response when u told him how much it hurts you, Maybe he didnt really understand when u said it. But your marriage is NOT doomed at all, this is something needing to be worked out and requires energy and hope, Good Luck!|`|364u9d9vaa	First of all.. I'm sorry to hear about your mother in law. Mine can be that way too! I think MOST marriages are on the rocks when they are just married, just learning to communicate with each other, and stuck under someone else's roof. My hubby & I lived with my parents after we got married. There was not many problems there, as my parents would mind their own business. We stayed there for 9 months and then we moved out of state because of the military. After a year we were finally discharged from active duty and we moved back home. With no steady job yet we moved into my in laws house. WHOA. was that a MISTAKE!! After 4 months we moved out because there was SOOOO much drama between us all. My in laws wouldn't ask me to help, but would get pist off when I didn't read their mind and do what they were thinking I should do. I would offer to clean the kitchen, and my MIL would say "it's okay.. I've got it" and then next thing I knew my husband was being told how lazy I was being. It was crazy!! Our marriage hit rock bottom, and I actually was looking into "my options". I couldn't take the @$$hole my husband was becoming, and I couldn't live another day with my in laws and their childish drama. We moved out in July and since then our marriage has gotten 100% better! Although I would never ever want to go through that experience again, it really did make our marriage grow stronger. We learned how to communicate with each other. Make sure you tell your husband how you feel and what you would like to do. Also listen to what he wants and feels, and try to come to a happy medium. Best of luck to you... marriage is hard... but if you love each other you can make it work!! =)|`|AjBpAPpdaa	Aww...how about you and your husband both save up for a new home, I know it sounds really expensive, but both of you guys need to sort it out. The money your saving up now use it to rent out a small home near his jobs, besides its only the two of you, and you're really young. If you really feel bad about the situation, have a nice and long chat with your hubby, tell him how you feel about your in laws and why. 2 times per week is not that much at all, try and call each other more everynight, have long sweet conversations you would then feel extra close. If I was you, I would save up money from my job, and if he's working, he should save up too, if you both don't have enough to rent out a small house, then loan some from a bank. I'm sorry that I didn't give good advice, but I hope I helped :) and Good luck! wish you all the best :D
qRwmWmDBaa	Yes, it is acceptable to smoke eclipse cigarettes after you quit smoking.|`|uB2K3XD0aa	it is acceptable. also, inducing vomiting also helps with getting rid of the habit of smoking. remember, smoking causes cancer, but what doesn't? or smoke stuff that doesn't have too many chemicals in it like marijuana or cuban cigars...good luck...|`|vGWD8Zncaa	Well, as a non-smoker I'd still never date anyone who uses Eclipses, either.    They still smell and still are unhealthy.
11nqBcOcaa	only you can prevent forrest fires|`|6RiLrsuBaa	who cares if you smoke sometimes?  eating too many cheeseburgers will shorten your lifespan and give you a heart attack.  does that mean you should never, ever eat cheeseburgers?  no, of course not.  having a cheeseburger once in a while is ok.  it's the same way with cigarettes.  since you're a strong person, capable of quitting, the fact that cigarettes are addictive and can give you cancer shouldn't keep you from ever smoking a single cigarette.|`|Midbg5BJaa	But smoking made you look so cool...|`|ceF5X2m7aa	nahh i dont think so..|`|zka26204aa	One day at a time.  That is how you deal with any addiction.
sVkSrUqNaa	he got really bad cravings but that gives him no right to say that stuff to you tell him to grow up no one force him to quite tell him to back off and take his mood swings with him  he might be  nice to you soon once the cravings stop hopefully or he's just a jerk|`|WWNWtzvDaa	wow he sounds like a right co*ck ...if i was you id wait until he was asleep sneak into his house and cover his WHOLE body in nicorette patches that should teach him =)|`|qsv4NmbDaa	what a dumbass he is, buy him some necatine gum|`|j3bE41RNaa	I think your friend might be going through a melt down!!     I know that cigarettes when you try to quit make you very irritable....but i've never heard of talking that much crap.     Maybe he has something else going on???    High hopes!|`|iYxlHLzeaa	I dont think quitting cigarettes do stuff like this, he might addicted to something else|`|GfphOIdOaa	tell him to either change his ******* attitude, start smoking again or you're out. If that doesn't wake him up, he's not worthy of you|`|DYiQtwMJaa	just give him a cigarete|`|qRwmWmDBaa	In a week if he's still not smoking he should have calmed down.  It takes a little bit to get it all out of your system.  Hopefully once he does calm down, he will apologize to you.
c2YcBbXyaa	she's the one you should be asking...not us...we don't know|`|28144eb29fc234a2e2c879b5109675a4aa	Because you met her parents doesn't at all mean she is in love with you.  She may want their opinion on you, or she cares enough about you to have them meet you and you meet them.   Sounds to me like if you feel she doesn't love you, that you 2 need to talk about it, before going any farther.    Speak from your heart...that works best !|`|9OsOeG53aa	I wouldn't count on it :-(|`|qRwmWmDBaa	HAHAHAH........You put in 2.5 yrs with this chick, and you haven't even got laid!?!?|`|vtm8lpFDaa	So you still haven't had sex? After 2.5 years?    A girl friend of mine has dated a guy for 3 years, and still haven't had sex. She had already introduced the guy to her family, and her to his. But she told me, without a doubt, that she is 10000% not in love with him, and she had never loved him. She dumped him for a guy she's crazy about (but doesn't like her back in return), and had sex with him even when he's made it clear that it's just sex and no love.    I don't know... I'm the type of girl who thinks sex is a very important expression of love. I think sex is very important in a relationship because it is the most intimate thing you can do with the person you love. But when a girl is sleeping with you, it doesn't necessarily mean that she is in love wiht you. But when there's no physical intimacy, I don't know... I could never hold myself back from doing something so intimate with the person I love.    So to answer you question, no it does not mean she is in love.
lwm48UiSaa	I am not referring to sex or anything physical.    There really isn't too much in the beginning of a relationship when you are this young. I assume it is both of your first relationship. Just don't scare her too much.Don't be too attached. I would guess that you guys go to the same school. Since you will be seeing each other every day be careful. It is easy to get tired of hanging out with the same person every day. Just try to balance the amount of time you spend with her and the amount of time you spend time with other friends.|`|3b94fe596a84f064ee3a1e8f25195be3aa	if she's fourteen i would think kissing would be a big deal and you work up to that slowly and then don;t take it much further,     but also - you could talk to her -& let her know you have this concern,|`|c2YcBbXyaa	you've known her for 3 years and now you're dating....you're doing something right....just keep on doing what you've been doing|`|J6X14hWIaa	um personally i dont think there is doing too much.   too little would be only making out after a month, by then you need to get it to the next level.|`|Do310qvTaa	ahem... welllll i would say that it would be safe to hold hands and maybe peck her cheek... just enjoy each others company for a while, no need to rush on in.    Please though, please please PLEASE don't go having sex yet, wait a few years till your both matured a bit, i know you say you love her and she loves you... but sex doesnt have to happen. Just remember that.|`|Joz0jTwGaa	if u are so worried, well go slow. hold hands or hug after 1 month  light kiss after 2 tongue after 3 months making out - hold off as long as u can. u two are very young.
peCO7RjWaa	take her  back to the beach..    have a swim and a laugh.. enjoy yourselves as friends AND lovers!    i suggest take her into the water, have a bit of a splash around (in a flirty, NOT childish way), and hold her. look into her eyes like you did before....    then just kiss her! I'M TELLING YOU SHE'LL LOVE IT! Because girls usually wait for the guy to make the first moves.     if your not sure how to kiss, then peck her softly on the lips. see her reaction. if she kisses you back or smiles etc. at you (which im sure she will!), then BINGO!     good luck, and remember relax and have fun!!!|`|1qTNn8qnaa	Hmmm...first kiss was in a movie theatre...pretty lame eh...i guess my bf doesnt really care abt the whole first kiss thing...he didnt take me out n e where special...but meh who cares...>.|`|Fnsea1sMaa	its not that important really  but it obviously is to you  so just do it somewhere where you're alone  and preferably in the dark, becasue people are more relaxed in the dark|`|l1wZEtOeaa	my first kiss was odd... but my first GOOD kiss with the guy i love was amazing and the only reason it was so amazing was because i cared soooo deeply for him... just pick some where you both like and just give her a quick little kiss on the lips, after the first kiss you wont be as nervous anymore and it will become easier to do and you will be more confident in yourself and so wil she =]
nQix64Puaa	maybe he's just being random. sometimes i feel like kissing another girl just to see how it feels. but i def wudnt do if my bf dislikes it. so i was just saying ask him why he said it and decide what to do from there :)|`|9DQDFiLuaa	how old are you ??|`|K2QwEM4raa	Just say no. His problem.|`|jRZletbXaa	That's is a really good question....How old are you???    You shouldn't have to worry about stuff like that if your either under 16 or married....otherwise what are you still doing with him if he passes comments like that...  I feel threesomes are gross....hint to him whether you like them or not....  But that is a weird question - try thinking normal and that might help you not to feel so pressured into something so wrong...    Kissing another girl when you are dating IS cheating - whether he said its ok or not...its cheating and also do you not think it would be hard to love two people???    Eugh.|`|5eG9uPxWaa	of course he wants a three some....just be glad its FFM and not the gay kind...|`|NK2lNxFdaa	aw forget it he doesnt want ya anymore|`|6fZzRFIXaa	he is talking **** and if he wants a threesome u must tell him to go to hell|`|CZVf1AZOaa	I don't think so, he is cheating on you, if your fine with it then its fine but I wouldn't be, Id say break up with him as soon as possible or he'll break up with you then you'll have all those feelings that a girl has after breaking up n blah blah (you know what I mean), so he's not your type girl you can do better :)|`|HH90Eghaaa	Then tell him so!  And yes in my experience he is buttering you up!
lwm48UiSaa	Do you need proof? The fact that you are even asking this question shows you don't trust him. And I think getting married would be the wrong idea if you are already this paranoid about something that you have no proof of. Just break up with him or have a serious conversation with him where you tell him that you think he cheated and dating him any longer would be pointless because there is no trust between you two.
e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Wait till you are old enough ?    You should ask them why they object. It might be they have seen something you may not have.    What was the reason for the breakup? That might give you a clue.    But, probably, they saw some jerk that has hurt their little girl (sad after breaking up) - and want to protect you from more hurt from the same source.    But, really, talk to them.|`|76ac0856e7fef6bc3f67d84b2c345683aa	once they an opinion on your boyfriend it's hard to change it. your parents know what's best for you so you should try listening to them..maybe he's not the right guy.  If, on the other hand, they are wrong you should do anything to convince them, like revealing his qualities to them. Make them meet and try to do this. Good luck!|`|jNQbVDHSaa	make up your mind on whether you will marry him, and tell your parents.
qpcYYWlIaa	Although your old school will not release her address to you, if you write to the school principal asking the principal to forward your letter to her; the principal may well do this for you. This way your friend can write you back.     At her age, it would be difficult to track her via websites without information about her parents.|`|X43oNJ9Zaa	i found lots of old school friends on friends reunited   so give it a go|`|xItSR9Z7aa	Yep, I can help.  Try this:    http://everestclimb.ws    Good luck finding your friend!
3VG1tCJ2aa	i dont think she considers you as her boyfriend. the best way to find out is to ask her. ask her about the real deal. the real deal about you guys.     co'z if she considers you as her boyfriend then you should be dating and spending time together. talking on the phone. watching movies. basically the stuff that boyfriends and girlfriends do.     have the guts to ask her. co'z it will be hard if ever you'll fall for then you'll find out that she already has a boyfriend. you'll be the one who'll be suffering.     ask her. dont be afraid to know what's really going on between you guys. GOODLUCK. :)|`|wwEnL5tBaa	Hmmm it seems to me that its just a friendship, but it also sounds as if she likes you abit?|`|ZVZpFuiQaa	your jst friends.  youu should ask her out  though if youu like her too.  shes jst flirting and crushing.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if u had something wonderful once, theres always a chance of getting back together with that person one day.u can never know if that other person is really done with u or not, but if the pain of being with them outweighs what u get out of the relationship its sometimes not worth it to continue. love isn't enough to justify staying with someone, and when it makes a person sad and it becomes nothing but heartache its time to move on and find where your suppose to be in life.|`|nBQeSu2faa	If you have been on and off over a period of 2 years...then I would say it should be off..once and for all. This sort of relationship is not good at all. It's unhealthy to continue like you are. If you do decide to get back together again..my advice to is...get your problems sorted out , if you don't you will spend the rest of your life , in On Off mode. You will look back some day and think... I wasted so many years in this unhealthy relationship. Get the the problems sort out or move on .|`|l0oDymHYaa	You can call the Shots|`|6cpx0eZOaa	u'll know when one of u doesn't care anymore|`|AA11996507	How about you stop being a yoyo and allowing her to pull your string, and make some decisions of your own instead.  She dumped you, it's over.  Stop waiting around for her to change her mind and set you up to be dumped again.  Make a decision to move forward with your life.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	When one of you finally realizes this just isn't working. If you've been in a relationship that has been rocky for 2 years, don't you think you would have worked out your problems by now? I think you are both wasting your time with this back and forth.|`|e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	When one of you doesn't care anymore!|`|626efa044358e718840b4df8894964f1aa	I think that you should just leave it alone. I was in an on and off again relationship and all it does is cause heartache. And i don't think anybody wants the same ex bf/gf 10 times or more. To me if it hasn't worked out the last how many times it's not going to. Either one of you could still feel the same way or just one of you may have those feelings there while the other doesn't care about you. It hurts yes but a relationship doesn't get anywhere by breaking up over and over again.
c2YcBbXyaa	you're going to need surgery for this.....you should get a reduction while you're at it so they won't be heavy and start sagging again.....i  think big breasts are gross|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Inject them with araldite.|`|3MbCFSjBaa	ummm..there's really not a way you can do that, A woman in your situation would need some sort of a boob lift, or job, And really that ur only option|`|YWmQKm9eaa	Well, you can do push ups, that develops muscles in the breast area that lifts them up. Or.. get a breast lift, from a cosmetic surgeon if you have the money. It's funny cause I see billboards giving "discounts" and stuff on implants and stuff like cosmetic surgery is the most normal thing in the world!
BNAzjSO1aa	It can be painful to have sex for the first time and there might be a small amount of blood but both are normal and nothing to worry about. Sex can also be painful if you are not ready for it because you will tense up and your vagina is basically a big muscle and if you are tense so is it. From the way you have worded the question I would say that you are to young at the moment to have sex you should remember that until you are sixteen then it is against the law. When you do have sex remember to practice safe sex and use a condom|`|GZzmcDeGaa	the first time does|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Yes for the first time, but it's all good after that.|`|9xVwpZ0faa	yes and you bleed|`|6RiLrsuBaa	from what i've heard the first time hurts, but just the first time.  if you're scared, try getting drunk first.|`|YE0baNYRaa	its not necessary that all girls experience pain. its sometimes pain. the reason being that the thin wall of the vagina is torn during sex. some girls dont have that wall covering from birth and its normal. if u are into atheletics then probably ur hymen will be already split n chances u wont feel the pain. in most cases its during the first time. be prepared just in case. ky jelly is a popular lubricant which u could try.|`|J6X14hWIaa	first time hurts. after that its ******* amazing.|`|JaOddaodaa	IF ITS UR 1ST TIME IT WILL PAIN.............BUT U CAN USE THOSE GELS THEY USE TO GET RID OF PAIN, THEY R AVAILABLE IN MEDICAL STORES.

aLwrpMPXaa	When mistrust comes in, love goes out.  ~ Irish Sayings    If I tell you "time will tell", I would lie.

It is very difficult to regain. You have to be convinced that it's worth the effort because it does take an awful lot of work. How the trust was lost plays a part in how it can be regained and what works for one will not work for everyone.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	If the lost of trust is due to infidelity, it can be very difficult to know how to put the trust back into the relationship.  There are self help books out there that can give you the right tools to use... or, you can go to marriage counseling which I recommend a lot to people because putting trust back after someone has cheated on you, is one of the most difficult issues to mend.|`|EENUWAP7aa	The trust  forms like cookie dough kneeded and layed out and then rise to perfection and bake to a nice crisp.    The entire process  is so long that some Mothers just choose to buy cookies rather than make them since it's so cheaper, but the challenge is to perfect your baking skills and make those cookies and so, when it comes to trust in a marriage that also is a process that few are willing to take.    You have to start with one process and then add another for example.    1 Month of intense respect for each other.  2 Weeks of dining out.  3. 4 baths together with candles lit.  4. 6 body rub massages given to each other.  5. Kissing every day, lots of kissing.    Do all these things and watch your trust bake right up to a beautiful reationship.  Winning back trust is not hard if your willing to travel the distance to get there.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	After all that I have experienced with my wife, I might say it's impossible.  I used to think women were equal to men but now I believe that women have a gas in their brain and their life's purpose is to use drama to destroy others.    After 12 years of marriage and 10+ years of excuses why we never have sex, I don't see why I'd believe anything she ever said, ever again.|`|CiRtM8lmaa	that is for you to find out.

nBQeSu2faa	He is annoyed with you because...you are not playing  his childish, immature, silly games. I gather from your question...this "man" is just a teenager... so if you are not really bothered about him being your friend, then you need to ignore him and move on. These games are a waste of time and serve no purpose at all.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	You've beat him at his own game. Evidently he can dish it out but can't take.

If you're going to fall in him, at later stage your life is going to miserable because of pride. Please treat him as a fren. Simple solution.     Regards  Saran|`|zAoKd2DBaa	he's a game player, an immature man who can't handle proper adult relationships.  He blows hot and cold.  He doesn't want a relationship with you but he wants you to want him.     Ignore him, not to get his attention but because he sounds like a prick.
wpi36XBAaa	Yes, me. Married 24 years and have not wanted to cheat, or even thought about "What if..?"  Sure there have been some rocky times, when I have wondered how we are going to make it through, but I never thought I'd be better off with someone else.   I don't flirt behind his back, or in front of it. I don't put friendships before him. I don't need that sort of confirmation of who I am.

Once upon a time I would have a different answer. I thought my husband was the ideal man. Now after months of having another female friend that he works with in my opinion it has just gone too far. Okay nothing has ever happened sexually between them BUT nights with his work crowd and always being her he hangs with, going back to lock in together. Dancing together, texts, calls, college together, and now i know he has told her things about our relationship and our problems. Loyal to me, I dont think so. Is he willing to stop it no. Does he appreciate what he has, no. I dont know what the world is coming to, but I dont like living in it. Hope this answers your question.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	First of all, I'd love it if cheating were that easy.  If I were a stud and could score any time, I guess maybe I would.  But I wouldn't know.  I couldn't cheat if I tried.  And I've tried.    But getting beyond the "free cheating", I just can't stand it when my wife doesn't want to have sex... ever.  Who the hell made the stupid rule that you're not supposed to have sex with anyone except your spouse... when your spouse doesn't want to!|`|e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	I have 2 internet boyfriends   ( A = 50yrs old married and B =  43 yrs old single)     I am married (they are aware).     I flirt dangerously with A but not to extend of sex on line.  B just normal chatting like between dad and daughter. (he declared he is 50 but I think he is more than 60)    I am flattered to have both of them as friend.  I may be behaving wild behind my husband back but cheat, no, I don't think so.  I see life as an opportunity.  When it becomes mundane, it is nice to have invisible friends around to keep us alive.  I thank the internet world as it has make my life happier!    You are what you want to be.|`|LomICtW1aa	It is totally wrong to expect loyalty this way and faith in this way.     Romancing is the birth right of each individual and one is free to romance freely.    it is the crooked intelligence of Men in the past to have invented a marriage system and impose it on future.|`|om89gdFIaa	If it's in someone's nature to flirt or cheat, then they would do it with or without the means of the internet.  Personally, I do not "cheat", nor do I "flirt".  I have many friends - male and female - all of whom I have a laugh and joke with, but I would no more do anything that would upset my partner than I would any of my friends.  I would be devastated if I found out that he, (or them), were doing it to me.  There are as many who appreciate what they have as who don't.  I hope that you are not one of those who have, unfortunately, found out that their partner or friend(s) fall into the latter category.  If they do, think about whether you really want those kind of people in your life!
EsVjwKPAaa	find it so cute... age doesn't matter to be a grandma.    for me, it would be fine coz you can still play along w/ your grandchild. can still run after him/her.|`|HlHB7dfHaa	I think under 36 is to young. 40 is fine.|`|x73U0nUBaa	My mum became a grandmother at 38, she loves it, she is still young enough to run around and have lots of fun with my son. I don't think there is any right or wrong age to become a gran, just make the most of it! Good Luck|`|jR6QWSfraa	I'am 29 and I'm grandpa from when I was 25, my sister was 15 years old when she became grandma. how you doing?|`|NqMmvvgVaa	My mum always told us kids, no kids before she turned 40. The year my Mum turned 40 my 18 year old brother came home to tell her his girlfriend was pregnant.  Lol, so pretty much she just made her limit, but my nephew Zachary is a wonderful addition to our family!! That was 7 years ago and my parents now have another grandbaby, bringing the grand total to 2 grandsons.|`|X43oNJ9Zaa	i think it is to young i am 15 and my parents are 45  but you must of had your son to early because 24 isn't to young to have a son at an early age    i think anything past 55 for a grandmother is fine|`|2AhcNaBzaa	no it's possible be a grandmother in your 30's|`|XK6k2UAIaa	Under 40 is way to young. But he is 24 so that is a pretty decent age to have a kid. I personally want to wait until I am at least 25. But your right at that age that is about average. I mean you were 16 when you had him if you are 40 so think about how your parents felt. Your not to young to be a grandma. Just think if he would have had a kid at the age you did you would be an even younger grandma.|`|RzeYy8dTaa	I think the age is 40 Your son decided it for you.Congratulations.|`|jRNexOtWaa	It doesn't matter about age, as long as you're happy! :)|`|8zAEQaSFaa	40 is totally fine :-)! I am sure the baby will be happy to have a nice Granny.

I have one friend who is 26 her mom is 44, he grandma is in her 60's and her great grandma is only 77!!! so just keep that in mind.    plus the age doesnt matter, just the amount of love you have does|`|b4ac2e36990501490c8e9d539cdec1d2aa	Silly question really. There is nothing you can do about it, so quit worrying about it. The kid isn't going to be phased by it, and that's the most important thing. Your insecurities are another issue. Maybe lose some weight so you don't feel like a granny.    Best of luck|`|hieQHR0daa	This is something we have no control over. When it happens it happens. You either enjoy it or you don't. What does it matter how old you are?|`|YN3qmN57aa	Congratulations on becoming a grandparent! In western society/cultural I don't think age really determines if you are too young to be a grandmother. The only way I can see someone being too young to be a grandmother is if the family (including grandparents) can't provide the child with a safe/healthy environment to be raised. And from a scientific standpoint you being a grandparent at 40 is great because by you and your son having kids before you are middle aged, it lowers the chance of your grandchild having birth defects as well as complications with the mother from giving birth.
fTVU0sP1aa	Only your bf can tell you what he feels. Ask him. You can say something like, "I told you how I feel about you. It's important for me to hear how you feel about me."    But be sure you're prepared to hear that your boyfriend may not feel the same way, and that is his right. That may be the reason he didn't respond when you told him you loved him. Sometimes it takes people longer to develop feelings. And some people may never develop the same feelings we have for them.|`|Pmt56tnzaa	My girl said she loved me probably 10 times before i said it back. I loved her i just wasn't ready to tell her for some reason.|`|SUzn3qfzaa	It depends on how old you are and how long youve been going out for, if yous are both teenagers it doesnt mean he doesnt love you.. But if yous are older and have been going out for years then well.. yeah.  Im 15 and i know that if im going out with someone i would tell them i loved them and mean it but i wouldnt expect a guy to say it back.    Hope this helped a bit//|`|vtm8lpFDaa	Some people just don't like to say these three little words so easily. I've only said it once, and i was because my boyfriend at the time forced me to, and I didn't want to hurt him.  He said "I love you... .can you please say that you love me? Please?".... and i was like... "um..... ok...... i.... love you..." But I really didn't mean it.    That was back when I was 17 with my 4th boyfriend. I've never said I love you before, and never since.    Although I love my current boyfriend very VERY VERY much, and we have been together for 4 years now, I still haven't said these three little words. I feel so... weird... with these three words.... I don't want to say it. But I do feel it very strongly in my heart that I really love him. I just don't want to say it. He asked me to, but I didn't want to say it. But I'm sure he knows that I love him.    But when all of my exs said I Love You to me, I didn't say it back, it was because I didn't love them.    It's really hard to tell.... It depends on how he reacts when you say it. If his face lights up, then he Might love you back but just doens't want to say it. But if he has this awkward facial expression then he probably doesn't love you back... Yet.|`|eW41wwCPaa	I dont think so ....|`|AA10268438	Well see it doesn't really mean he doesn't love you. Maybe he really really likes you just isn't ready to tell you he loves you. If you've been with him long enough and feel comfortable then you may confront him. Goodluck :)|`|b82ybE3gaa	Its really his feelings. He probably really likes you but he might have developed the "love" feeling yet, or perhaps he has those feelings he just isn't sure what they mean. I doubt that he doesn't feel anything but is still with you. =)
01fb05bd5dd8c079e3ea940fd187e301aa	Just be honest with him and ask him out. This is the 21st century after all. not everything should be left up to girly hints and clues which most of us guys are not even 'evolved' to decipher. Be honest. I can't tell you how flattered I'd be if a girl moved a mountain to be with me, even if I had to turn her down in the end.     Sure you may get rejected, sure he may be scared by your advance, but that's his problem not yours. Guys who freak out when women make the first move are losers anyways.    You have nothing to lose except him (to another girl) if you don't step up and be adult about it.    Go for what you want in life girl!

And wanting to better yourself is a wonderful trait.   How about concentrating on listening and enjoying the conversations of others, so that you can concentrate on not blabbing, but listening instead.

If your secrets are that bad, maybe you need a therapist to work through them.|`|7CuotevFaa	Tell us more about you|`|se3oYPooaa	You might be a good person you may not be a short tempered, that is why, you tell always truth instead learn how to tell lies, white lies and if anybody catches you tell you just joked, if they are insisting get angry with them. Nowadays telling lies has become an art for this reason, you can say it is for 'security' reasons, learn from receptionists how do they lie for their bosses.     Another trait is you may want to be familiar with others never think so, because familiarity breeds corruption.    And also don't try to entertain people by talk or stories or with breaking news, you will fail they may think that you look for some favour or gift or loan etc., it is very difficult to please people by giving money or gifts much less, advices! Cut them when you don't want being selfish, never say you are free and ready for a talk; pretend you are always busy.    Be status conscious and avoid people you consider want to jeer or domineer or consider you a source of fun.

dDZ42kDKaa	At any age, there are things that are hard and things that are awesome. The hard things about being an adult are things like paying bills, being broke, having to do all your cooking and cleaning on your own, and when things go wrong, your parents aren't there to hold you and fix things for you - you have to do it yourself.    But you have all this freedom to do what you want, when you want, how you want. And you become less self-conscious and more mature than when you were a teenager (not that there's anything wrong about being self-conscious and less mature as a teenager - it's an important stage in growing up!)

Do not hold me responsible if my advice leads to things going terribly wrong.)    Obviously you had a very emotionally draining experience. You are sympathetic to her despite your feelings towards her, since your brother loves her. This is the same reason you were accepting of her as your future sister-in-law.     It is very unhealthy for couples to isolate themselves, and usually it takes breaking up for them to realize why it is so unhealthy. If it were me, I'd discuss the situation of her coming to you with your brother and try to back away from her in the sitation. It is your brother's decision to make and it would be inappropriate for you to become more involved with her during their breakup without him being aware. If your brother asks you to help her out, make her keep your schedule so she can't continue wearing you out emotionally.      Considering they were planning to marry, it is sad that she never reached out to you prior to this crisis in their relationship. I think that speaks a lot about who she is.|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	Because seeing other people in emotional distress reminds us of our own vulnerability.|`|XeO7XdQhaa	I think you really love your brother, if you didn't then I think you really wouldn't be feeling like this today.

You could possibly also be feeling the relief maybe that your bro has finally seen thru this woman??   Start to focus on ur own life, or sort them out and you might feel a bit better.

Both our trains arrive and leave at the same time, and since both of us were cautious about the other at first, we could quite easily leave if needed.    If you intend on meeting contacts that you don't know, I strongly suggest you meet in a public place during the day, and I recommend having a friend with you (or at least close by). And tell someone where you're going.    Good luck :)
uSUkZHBPaa	You didn't say what his interests are, but if he has a hobby or a collection, you can get him something for it.  Does he like to read?  You could get him a gift certificate from a book store so that he could pick out books that he likes.  Does he fish?  You could get him a new pole, or some nice tackle.  Is he a Mr Fix It around the house?  Find out what new tool he needs, or wants.  Is he interested in any special event going on now, like a car show or a sporting event?  You could always take him to it, or give him a couple of tickets to it.  Does he like to listen to music?  You could get him a CD or two of his type of music.  All I'm trying to say is - think about what he likes to do, what his activities are, then get him something related to his fun times.   If all else fails, spend some time with him, then take him out to dinner.  Remember though, if you take him somewhere - move at his speed.  60 year olds usually have a little trouble keeping pace with younger people.    My birthday happened last summer while the state fair was going on.  I would have loved to have had someone take me to it for the day.  That's not something I would do by myself.|`|QtzB7En3aa	My husband recently had his 50th birthday and ppl had the same dilemer.He doesn't drink wine or anything else much at all. His hobby is horses. His sister gave him a lovely bronze statue of 2 horses and quite a few ppl gave him gift vouchers to a chain store called 'saddle world'. He bought himself a whole heap of horse stuff that he wouldn't usually spend money on. He also got a lovely book. Just a few ideas for you to mull over.|`|Yl4iHHBqaa	If he is into car collectables (my pop is) get him a rare one? a nice watch made with the colour gold?  a grandfather clock?|`|35d48c68a50cb76f01fce1bc599e0953aa	Gift card ? electronics ?

MGC1NKnVaa	First of all, learn how to spell it.  It's "propose," not purpose.  Then think about what she might like based on her personality.  Think about things you've done together that you have both enjoyed.  Try to come up with a way that will be romantic and have meaning to the two of you.  If you try to do a generic proposal based on a top ten list, it won't be nearly as romantic.  Sorry to bust your chops about the spelling, but hey.|`|1SnI86BIaa	well if you havent shown her you loved her yet  i hiighly doubt shes gonna say yes when you propose..|`|aOjMf5SPaa	I think the most romantic way I was proposed to was on holiday. I went down to get something from the bar - A bottle of champagne he'd preordered. I brought it back up, and there were balloons in a line going to the bedroom. Each one had a card on it, that was a part of a sentence. Its was so gorgeous. And when I got to the room, he finished off the sentence with 'will you marry me'. Awwwww. so so sweet.|`|f55mQq7taa	wtf does that mean?|`|LV9l8EFkaa	by 'purpose' do you mean 'purchase', ha ha loser|`|ihu7Oh5gaa	jus go n teel her tat u love her but do it innovatively... lik take her out 4 dinner n thn tell her at d rite tym... dont overdo.. all d best..|`|GRuIq6Igaa	There are many ways to show her how much you love her.  It depends on her tastes though.  Does she like flowers?  Candy?  Songs?  Dinner?  Or is she a cute puppy kinda girl.  Is she shy or outgoing?  Does she like to be in the center of attention?  There are so many ways.  How about about getting her family in on this?|`|jTNlDNBPaa	just be upfront. tell her what she means to you and why you love her so much. (: x|`|OUtYUT8daa	Propose?  Wow. Thats great!  Take her to a place thats close to both of you.  Where you first met maybe?    Take her home to where you have put rose petals all over the room and candles are lit and when she enters get down on one knee. And do it!    Have fun with it. Make it a moment to remember!        (That is if you are proposing of course)|`|rB82Ujlgaa	go to her favorite place if she likes they mountains take her there or the beach you get i am saying

LwafcbTyaa	You wont know for sure if he still has feelings for her until you ask him and also your mind wont rest until you do! I wouldn't approach the girl he was seeing at christmas as she is likely to tell him you asked about the two of them etc etc and that never sounds good on your part.    Also if you approach him and ask about if hes currently in a relationship etc he will know that your interested - but i wouldn't make this the start of the conversation - just drop it in along the way casually.    He is clearly attracted to you if he says "your hot" so don't be afraid of approaching him!    However, if he is on/off with this girl stay well clear. There are far too many men who are single out there and also you don't want to be caught up in a love triangle situation. If hes single fine but if not stay away until their relationship fizzles out.    I hope everything works out for you! x|`|nQix64Puaa	thats tough since he likes to flirt that much. i say take a crack and ask him the way he feels about you, either by talking to him on messenger or face to face, doesnt matter. and time will get everything straightened out as well. maybe what you should do now is just try to be friends with him until you feels he truely loves you :) oh or you may wanna get ready he's just playing mind games and urself not get hurt once you found his trick out. :)|`|OUo9J4i1aa	well it sounds to me that he really likes her a lot you know I'm not sure where your relationship is going your going to have to talk to him and tell him how you feel otherwise if you keep this bottled up you might explode emotionally she should know better than hang around someones boyfriend.|`|R2mNsqSHaa	sounds like hes very confused, or tryin to play u both and see which is better, if i were you, id get out of it before you fall to heavily and yu get really hurt
fccwRLo2aa	hey you guys, don't judge the girl..

Lemme fill you in on what comes next.    She's going to tell you should some sort of emergency that she needs to handle that requires an immediate payment of money.

15138853c1cb3b1c3ba1e3d5ca6a8aecaa	Sex isn't all that great if you jump right into it. Talking about your childhood, fondest memories, best thing you like about each other, playing games where you have to guess each other's favorite color, food etc., telling each other about how you would like the other to be dressed and your wildest fantasies are some of the good things to set the mood.    Try different locations and settings...bathtub with candles all around...beach...bedroom with incense etc.    It's sensuality that is fun. Making up erotic stories together is also a good idea.|`|n2bx6xW7aa	have u tried teasing him online. give him a sexy dance and touch yourself.why not try this.

You being submissive or aggressive or mix it up?  Watch porn together?  Cook him an elegant meal?  Play with him while he's driving?  Sexual acts you haven't tried?  Go to a strip club together?  Pamper him; give him a massage.  Flatter him; "Oh baby you're so ..."  Screaming orgasm.  Play strip poker.  Common male fantasy; threesome with 2 girls.|`|qsNwAk7Kaa	I'd advise getting him and yourself drunk and then you can ask him straight out if there's anything he wants you to do to him.     Doesn't work for everyone, but i'm a drunkard. What can you do?

AA11452268	To be honest, if you've been an occasional jerk to someone you've liked for three years and have gotten jealous of people who dated who to the point of wanting to hurt them, even though you yourself were not dating her, it might be a good idea to just keep your news to yourself. Just try being a good friend for a while without all the jealousy and jerkfulness. Then if 3 years from now you still feel the way and you actually perceive that she has become increasingly fond of you, it might be okay to tell her at that point. But if you've been a jerk for 3 years and she is showing no signs of any mutual affection (beyond generic friendship), then keep it to yourself.

074ad08aae129f862ba709f70251e7f8aa	It's the "Grass is greener on the other side" thing, you want what you can't have.  So when you're nice to guys (this applies to girls as well) then  they take you for granted and don't try to be nice to you.  And when you treat them like an unimportant person, they see this as a challenge to get you to like them.  Go figure.  Another thing is that guys & girls don't seem to like someone who likes them, maybe they're scared or something.  It seems to be easier to like someone who isn't "hung up" on you, if you know what I mean.  Just my 2cents worth. ;-)|`|AA11126198	Its called control, and women do it too.

Women are evil, men are stupid. And Vice Versa.     Also the guy will see you as a challange, you are keeping him on his toes.

Marriage was mean tto be with one man and one woman...not shared.  Polygamy is nothing but Male chauvenists.|`|AA10493015	In some sense, it is allowed due to child support laws.  Anybody can have sex with anybody and the child support laws provide for the support of the children.      the problem is that most women chose loser guys to have sex with / get pregnant with.      With polygamy, men could only take additional wives if they could support all of them and their children.      It is good for the older women too, because the man does not simply trade the old woman in for a younger model, i.e. divorce.  The old woman gets taken care of and the man gets to have sex with a younger woman.        In response to the woman's answer above, and her rant about male chauvinism, blah, blah, blah.  That's just the way men are, take it or leave it.  Men like sex with attractive younger women and nothing is going to change this.  Now, public policy has changed some behavior - women can vote, there are laws against domestic violence, sex harassment in the workplace, equal opportunity based on gender, etc. but there are not and never will be laws against what creates arousal in a man.   I think that there was a court case that said that there is "no right to be liked or loved".  Anyway, polygamy could have some benefit to society because it could provide economic support for older women.   The other alternative could be marketing Viagra for ED caused by unattractive older women.     I am not advocating it.  I am just playing "devil's advocate.  King Solomon had multiple wives and concubines.      I saw this thing on 60 minutes or dateline.  The guy, a gazillionaire, had 25? wives and over 75 kids on this huge compound in Utah.  It was wild.  I could not have been aroused by any of his wives except this 19 year old one.|`|AA12316977	it already is if you live in Utah and in the desert|`|AA12003520	not on this planet.|`|AA12358122	its sort of in sync with nature but against morality to some extent but men seek to spread their seed and women like to gather so hey it would make sense - if the whole worlds where not too busy judging others im sure more people would opt for Polygamy|`|AA12323648	No not at all!|`|AA11938001	Is that legally or religously??????  I see no harm in it.  I mean, people do it when they are "shacked up", it's just without the paper.  Swingers or roommates do it, just without the paper, licensed paper that is.      If the church or religion wants to deny it, then let them,  It is the persons choice to believe in or obey the churches "rules" or turn their back and disobey the "polygamy rule" and have more than one wife or husband.  Now, for the legallity of it, It is none of the city, county, state, or the Federal Governments business.  Why should a government have the authority to deny any person or persons the right to have more than one one mate.  There is a seperation of church and state.  Everyone preaches it, with the 10 commandments here or there on Federal buildings and prayers in school.  Have the Government Butt out,  and mind their own business.|`|AA10546011	Why not if all the parties involved are consenting adults.|`|AA12104884	no|`|AA10888290	no

AA11072493	only the freaky girls! i like when guys say that, a pervert is someone who looks in the window when ur showering. being horny is a good thing and its not perverted|`|4d45b2bf5e6a719e396180c0f4ad7f13aa	there are more male perverts than female.men just dont seem to have a prob with sayin wats on their minds sex wise.but women tend to find that if a man who is not their partner and make Cretan remarks are being disrespectful. just be careful with what ya say|`|AA11452268	Both sexes can be equally mean or sadistic, of course (or at least that's my opinion), but men do seem to dominate when it comes to sexual harassment and assault. Most cases of sexual harassment are men who sexually harass women, although sometimes women sexually harass men, and other times men sexually harass other men.    The legal definition of sexual harassment is as follows (see edit note below about the use of cut and paste here): "Sexual harassment is any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment."    Sexual harassment is not simply "flirtatiousness, hormones or sexual desire. Most harassers share a common goal - intimidation."    But of course, outside of work men are even less on their best behavior and more likely to sexually harass women because they are less likely to be prosecuted for sexual harassment if it's not work related. My personal experience is that the occurence of sexual innuendoes and sexual jokes made by men on the job have decreased tremendously in the last decade, but stupid sexual references made outside of work by men have not.    And then there's the case of sexual assault, which may take things even further. Sexual assault is defined as follows: "Sexual assault can be verbal, visual, or anything that forces a person to join in unwanted sexual contact or attention. Examples of this are voyeurism (when someone watches private sexual acts), exhibitionism (when someone exposes him/herself in public), incest (sexual contact between family members), and sexual harassment. It can happen in different situations, by a stranger in an isolated place, on a date, or in the home by someone you know." Both men and women, adults and children, can be victims of sexual assault. The perpetrators of these crimes are almost always male and usually identify themselves as heterosexual, even if the assault was against another male. In other words, sexual assault is a type of sadism that men seem to have a monopoly on. So no, girls don't have their sadistic side, too, at least not when it comes to sexual assault.    Not that the occasional dirty joke makes you a sexual offender. Obviously that's not usually the case. However, if people often find sexual comments disgusting or offensive that you personally think are harmless or amusing, it may be that you're crossing a line. It's always best to err on the side of conservatism when it comes to sexually explicit comments or jokes. After all, what you consider playful and amusing might come across as sexual harassment to someone else. It should go without saying that if the "girl" who calls you a pervert is a coworker or employee, you're breaking the law.      EDIT: Although I have answered using my own opinion, and in fact in more detail than the previous answerers, I did copy and paste select sections of text, but all of them are in quotations, and sources are given below. This is called documentation, and it's something that people do regularly to back up their own arguments with solid evidence without plagiarizing. After all, in certain settings, supposedly harmless sexual comments can and do constitute sexual harassment, which is a CRIME. The opinion about the girls vs. boys issue I have answered in my own words, but to explain the difference between a merely annoying comment and an annoying comment that breaks the law requires an understanding of the law itself. And what better way to point out the meaning of the law than to quote it fully? It would be arrogant and potentially negligent of me to presume to speak for the law when Congress has already defined sexual harassment for us; hence the "cut and paste" sections (all of which are in quotes) to which you apparently (and erroneously, in my opinion) object.    Is that enough of my own answer "as I feel it" for you, or do you need some more?

It sounds as if you broke off with him because he didn't give you the reassurance you needed to feel loved.  So, for your mental health you broke off.  That was the right thing to do.  Now, however, you are suffering because you feel alone, abandoned (even though you technically ended it), sad and fearful about the future.  You may also feel angry that he forced your hand.  The details are unclear, and I'm guessing a lot here.  I encourage you to contact a marsvenus coach to suss out all the issues going on within you.

AA11581589	The size of his thing shouldn't matter.  As far as anything else that would be up to you.  You can't let anyone else decide what you like about guys.  You would be the one spending time with him so it would be whatever you find attractive.|`|1ea187d742c6bff44ba1e157823fa4e3aa	The size of their 'thing' has nothing to do with it.

AA12303738	No you're not. what you need to do is forget about me, same thing happened to me and i wasn't that happy. stop calling him, forget about him but you still like him right, i know it's hard but let him come to you okay, don't go to him, let him come and if he doesn't find yourself another guy fast. sorry|`|AA10565376	Sister friend you are going way to fast for this guy! Slow down and give him some breathing room. Stop calling him so much and give him some time to call you. Yes, this will be hard to do but you can do it! Everytime you want to call him call one of your friends and talk to them. Also you already said you two didn't know each other but you have already shared some really big issues in your life with him (depression and anorexia). Not to mention you burdened him with helping you get through it. This may have scared him off. So sit back and work making youself a better person instead of smoothering him and let him take in everything. And if he wants to start a relastionship he has your number. Good Luck to you!|`|AA11189123	may b he's playin u .. u know playin hard to get n all cool .. may b that's y u like him coz he's not so desperate like most guys .. dont worry ur not crazyy hehe .. love is confusing .. but try not to like ppl who dont deserve u n treat u like **** .. in ur case .. do EXACTLY what he's doin to u .. dont answer his callz n blablabla .. he might come runnin after u|`|fe76ac414eff458ffafbbbf417c99562aa	Did you ever stop to think that maybe he was only being nice. He may only want to be your friend. Besides if he helped you get over some strong hurdles it only means he's a good person not someone you have to get involved with. When you hit on a guy its healthier if you two have things in common. He should have the same reaction you have. Bammo a spark! If he avoids your calls it could mean anything. Like he's already involved, doesn't want to connect for personal reasons, he might be gay, he might not be attracted to you sexually (but generally thinks your nice looking). Just give him space. Guys dont like feeling chained down. Relax sugar. Look elsewhere.|`|AA12256785	You are not crazy, these are feelings, there is no on and off button, I think if there was everyone would be happy.Anyway, he may not like you or he just doesn't like to talk on the phone.Maybe you shouldn't call him that much and maybe you guys are better off as friends.|`|AA10191605	nope, your normal|`|267650f0019818d680758de0eeaa34b1aa	What is your email address.

AA11107557	You should first take a chill pill and realize its not the end of the world. Then you should listen to what he said. He probably didn't mean anything by it, really.     You know what, you could of went over and said hi too. So why didn't you? Your boyfriend should be mad at you for not coming over and saying hi. If you think he should be mad then you can be mad. But if you don't think its fair for him to be mad then its not fair for you to be mad.|`|AA12188861	maybe he was just shy, maybe he was intimidated by your friends and seeing that u were busy talking to them.|`|AA10369755	I dont think too much into it.    So, dont worry about it but keep a close watch and act if you see more of this behavior.|`|AA11948469	so...read read your own story...imagine your best friend is telling you this.  where is your boyfriend's priorities?|`|14492cde5833e8cef0cbbf5b8a6df091aa	you shouldn't be mad because you didn't go over there to say hi either...and maybe he didn't go over to you for the same reason that you didn't go over to say hi to him.    Although i do think it's weird for a couple to be at the same place and neither of them saying hi to each other...maybe  you haven't been together that long?|`|61befb70a077d8b7027bfb76681a646aaa	girl it time to move on cause he a man they all way tryin to so off there girl to there friend and aint say nothing to u . see  me i would a hit him in the head with something|`|AA12316361	That he was being honest, he was just having a good time hangin' out with his padres. Now the better question is, why didn't you say hi?|`|AA12224021	Don't be mad. There is a small circle made to be big. Us boys want girls to make a move and from what I hear you girls want boys to make the move. It was just that circle taking its toll on you two.|`|AA12360980	you should have said hi to him!!! if he said he wasn't mad u shouldn't be mad at him!!! at least he said sorry!!!|`|db060e399071ec06f18b628e3562a3b0aa	i think you should first clear your mind, i didn't think you shouldn't be mad about it, they may have been talkin' about something important, i don't think you should take things like that but soo seriously. I have a friend who's boyfriend is my old bestfriend and she sometimes blows me off so things implied. So maybe he doesn't want people to think he's feeling you. who knows

AA11190264	that depends on the person. some of us show love more than hate. you'll find out once you get older.|`|c52898de5c35470fa97ed4b2e0c5eb63aa	Probably 'coz love is a more complex emotion despite people saying that love and hate are two sides of the same coin.|`|AA10682479	cuz if you show hate when you love someone its easier not to get hurt when they don't return the love or they break ur heart.|`|AA12253249	It does depend on the person; I personally find it easily to show love, I bottle up anger, hurt, and hate inside. Some people are just scared to show love, they might want to but find that they don't have the courage to and hate is just easier. They might be afraid of being stepped on or thought of as weak so they attempt to appear tough by being hateful.

AA11654055	You NEED to be married? Uh....why?|`|5c463cb9c0484834a97ceb31b3721b5eaa	"Need" is a strong word when it comes to marriage... I would like to suggest that you "need" to love yourself enough to first take the time to explore where the desperation is coming from... why you don't feel okay with yourself being unmarried... The idea I'm proposing is to first get comfortable with totally being with YOU and then allow for someone in your life that you love to share that YOU with.|`|AA11550639	Wow. Why do you NEED to be married? Maybe that's the real question. If you can't bring up the subject with him, you can probably do better...good luck!|`|AA12348611	Come on where have ur guts gone.....ur a 21st century woman..Just talk to him about it in clean simple words|`|f7e9b138df29ae33c98ee1f2a737d794aa	listen to me...believing is seeing!just keep ur head up, believe in it,and u will get it!

AA12053662	Tell her that the relationship is not working out and that you think you two should break up.  Tell her that she can have a few weeks (set a definite number, like three weeks or one month) to sort herself out but that after this period she will need to move out.  Be firm but fair.  Don't burden yourself unduly with all of her problems.  As long as you don't act like a total jerk and kick her out on the street then you have no reason to feel guilty.  You can't be with someone out of sympathy, and you are not responsible for her however much you might feel like you are.  Best of luck...|`|41a7e4868dd006ea6ef34cbf1aa082f5aa	are you trying to say you dont love her any more ? if so tell her and explain why you are done if you cant then go on being miserable. also if you still care try not to leave her in a bad way, after all you have been enableing her for a long time and she may not know how to care for her self,medicaly or emotionaly,|`|AA11281094	Propose constant anal sex.|`|AA10320530	If you don't love her, then tell her and get on with your own life. You are not responsible for her unless you choose to be.|`|AA10494168	Tell her that your not happy in the relationship. Let her know that you will help her within the best of you ablity but that she is going to have to find a job to support herself and her medical bills. She can baby sit children are whatever. Medical issue shouldn't be your excuse for not supporting yourself unless a doctor tells you that you can never work again.|`|7f10d47ed6d3a4cd32a1a71d08f75668aa	by medical issues i take it she is sick and that's why she;s not working?its 1 thing to bail when u don't luv someone quite another to be so selfish to want to leave because she's sick and can;t work!!!i bet she supported u before she got medical issues.what a jerk1what goes around comes around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA12056184	close the door on her and tell her to get a life. sorry but she has issues|`|AA11738973	1) you pack up her stuff in HER bags    2) you put the bags in front of the door    3) you change the lock of the door    4) when she gets home, you stand in front of the garden entrance and just say bye now...    5) give her cash for a cab plane and "get lost" indemnity.    6) buy a trained dog that will deter her from stalking around your house for some time    7) get a younger, fresher and cuter gal    enjoy for few years, and repeat points 1 to 7|`|AA12059569	Its gonna be hard but if you dont love her you cant stay in that situation. And dont continue to let her believe you do love her  dont give her hope if there is none. You need to talk to her about how you feel and see if there is family or friends she can go live with.|`|AA11638259	Just be honest with her, you don't own her problem...and get out man!  7 years without a paying job...yikes!|`|AA11638318	why hasn't she worked ,,,you have made it so easy for her...this is a tough one if she is mental then you are going to have problems ,,,good luck with this one|`|AA11938273	tell her the truth. the harder you put her down the more she will realize on what she is doing, trust in your instinct.|`|AA11298307	Wow Well if you are serious about breaking it off with her I would do the following;    Tell her that it isn't her (even if it is, spare her feelings), it's issues that you need to work out.    Tell her that (that is if she can't get a disability check, or social security) that your not trying to hurt her feelings, but that she can't always depend on people to support her. Let her know that being co-dependant can lead to a dangerous road and that regardless if you two are together or not you both aren't going to be here forever and that it's a good idea to stash some money for some cushion.    Or ask her what would she do if you got laid off from your job, Give her the con's of being co-dependant.    If she still doesn't get it or understand I would just leave it as that , still be friends since you guys have history.    Good Luck!|`|AA12097242	Very carefully. Be honest, straightforward and don't back-peddle. Good luck.|`|b4c8067a1176b8d46a9081786485faa6aa	It's time to let go. You love her so much that you have to let it her go. By you staying with her that's allowing her to continue doing what she is doing, because she has you as a security blanket. So LIG it and let it go!!|`|AA12219690	umm becareful she might get alimony but i would just tell her and be done
b8567c877416065c4d9be4afda61d9daaa	i prefer older woman as well.  not like 40 but that's cool.  i think there looking for someone fun and young, but still mature.  not like silly fun, but someone who can show them a good time, but still be mature and is successful.|`|AA12300552	try with u r mother|`|AA11537569	They want the same things young ones want.   Whatever you did to get that 40 yr old interested in you....trying it again.  Older women just love the young ones.|`|AA12063577	I'm with a 22 year old .. I'm not that much older but I'm very independent and mature for my age...     The one thing that has attracted me to him the most is the way he makes me feel.  He makes me feel so special to him - like I'm his world.  He enjoys making me happy so in return I love to make him happy.    He likes to show me off ... he looks to me as a friend, a partner & a lover.  He has so much energy and I feed off of it !  I get to show him a few tricks and he gets to keep me on my toes !    Older women want to feel apprciated, respected, cherished, valued ....etc.... !  Most of them have been through a lot in their lives and know a thing or two so to have somebody acknowledge that is very gratifying !
AA11128712	If he's really not into it, you'll probably never persuade him.  But lots of men have dormant spanking instincts, or at least can be induced to spank if they realise how much it turns their partner on.  Try doing something a bit naughty - hiding the remote usually works well - to get him to give you a few swats.  Then respond with the best BJ you've ever given him.  Once he gets the idea that spanking = the wildest sex ever, you're well on your way.    Good luck!|`|AA12345487	search b&d s&m on the internet, find out about it, then share the links with him|`|AA12362774	try to find out if he likes to be dominant, if so tell him you have been bad and need to be punished
AA10232052	sure you can. but it may be you shocked if she wants too and then proceed to beat the hell out of you(LOL)|`|AA11128712	Sure, why not?  And maybe she'll ask you to spank her too.|`|AA11689279	sure. it's not like you're doing anything bad to her. it's a simple question. there's no reason why you can't!|`|AA11226021	If you like it ,Ask her.long as she dont think that your a weridoo.  ask her how would she feel if a guy ask her to do such a thing.|`|AA12008763	sure you can!|`|AA10938665	you can ask a girl anything you like..it's whether she will do it or not....smiles|`|c7e7ab2a588686f884c341deadf4d967aa	dont ask, but imply it. like say "you know you wanna spank this" then bend over and wave your butt alittle. Thats how i spank my boyfriend. hehehe.
AA11841705	well, i am not sure... but i caught my b/f cheating on me, and he used to do me the same way... he would pick a fight with me over something petty and stupid, so that he could be mad at me, so that he wouldnt feel guilty about sleeping around....|`|500123b280cc578ac1bd0e9d3aaa58eeaa	It is a possibility.  Mine will start fights with me just to have make up sex. Even though is might be a couple of days later
AA12244965	For the 10000th time.... if you were in love with someone, you wouldn't be asking questions like this!|`|AA12352295	u will have that mixed wonderful feeling when u see him, u won't be able to stop looking at him & u'll feel that ur feet are on the clouds just when u see him looking at u & u'll be even more happy  just 4 hearing his voice even if he isn't talking to u.u'll feel that only a touch from his hands can sweep all ur pain away & that when u are between his warm arms  then u are separated  from the whole world & u will know that this is the only place where u feel safe & secure.|`|AA10894438	well you go out of your way to do things for them, you have this feeling that dosen't o away until you stop loving them, are you in lovE? im not well not yet.......i think i love JESSE MCCARTNEY though! lol|`|AA10608381	This is the last  time I answer this question. If you were in love with someone you would know it. There's no way to avoid it. You want, desire, need , can't live without, dream of, hope for,scream for in your dreams, fantasize about, get butterflies in your stomach for, and hang on til the bitter end or die for!!!!!!!!!  Take my word for it.........|`|1452fd23040bbeb2259a41c5e20e54ecaa	well friend u always call this guy in every min and u like to talk to him and every time u wait for him|`|AA10612009	You get butterflies in your stomach, you cant get them out of your mind, and you are real excited to see them.

When you see him, you forget to breath.|`|a30cb8e65f80ebded7fbfe7504ebe62aaa	Because you always have the thought of him on your mind and you could never imagine hurting him or being without him. Thats when you know your really in love with a guy.|`|AA11279777	You'll read his/her IMS over and over again...  . You'll walk really, really slow while you're with him/her...    You'll feel shy whenever you're with him/her...    . While thinking bout him/her...your heart will  beat fast     you don't really notise other people around you...you can only see that person...     You'll start listening to SLOW songs.  .     He/She becomes all you think about.      . You'll realize that you're always smiling to yourself  when you think about them..    . While reading this, there was one person on your mind the whole  >>> >>time.
AA11371917	your headline had me worried there for a minute.  put yourself in her shoes, you would probably do the same, ask her to go to the movies and let her bring her bf, mention it is a chick flick and he might say you two can go alone.  at the start of any relationship the new partner is the only person you want to spend time with, it will slow down and you will be back on the scene soon, just be patient.    ps don't bad mouth him or anything just be there caus there is a chance she will need you to talk to later on. and she will pick him over you|`|AA10501358	well ask her to go to the movies with her and bf and u and a guy u like   this way u have somebody she had somebody and u guys spend time together    after awhile she wont spend as much time with her bf so just wait but do this plan for awhile|`|AA11877654	it will blow over but she might think ur jealous if you push on her|`|AA11569937	just ask her 4 a dayz out lik ya'll use 2 have and after u spend a dayz out with her remind her how much u miss her and ask her if she could start 2 balance u and her bf

Tell her that it doesn't mean anything yall are just friends. If she doesn't stop then try telling your friend that is her boyfriend to talk to her. who cares what people think anyway as long as you & him know yall are just friends & have fun together that is all that matters!!!|`|AA12121098	Your friends gf  probably is saying that so you wont do stuff like you are diong that she doesnt like.  she thinks u will back off so she can be his main priority.  she is worried she may have some compoption for her bf.  jsut maybe do more  friend like things than playing around type things,  Be nice still though.  good luck.

AA10424973	I really don't think you have enough time to do that last one, do you?  That might not be healthy either.  Maybe if you rephrase the question to be a little less offensive, you wouldn't get ridiculous responses.  But if you really want an honest opinion, you will have to put up with some ragging from easily insulted people.  Don't be oversensitive, like they are.  That's what you have to put up with in an open forum.|`|660e44e48a2567f3b376dd927fc750c1aa	excuse me dont even go there and say ya redneck people to me cuz i didnt even mean it towards ewww to you. so if you dont mind delete your F***ed up shti you said on my question.|`|AA12374306	Nice question, I think.

Prep yourself up and meet up with her, then mention that you're getting hungry and ask her to go with you. While you guys are munching out, bring up new movie releases and ask her which one she would like to see. At that point, you check showtimes and away you go. Good luck!|`|AA11557002	"Hey (so-in-so), how are yah? Hey, I saw a commercial for a new movie that's coming out....looks like it might be a good one!

Why would you allow this to continue, unless you feel you have no way out.  Find a way to change it, leave, or go on accepting it.  I do think that 19 is a bit old for a spanking, but I don' t know how your family structure is set up.  When do you get to spank her?  Just a thought!|`|32958f6ab8f8d86d9beeff7a4ed174edaa	Yes and she could be arrested for assault. The only option you have is to get a job and find your own place.|`|AA11744609	Definitly.  Though no one should be spanked in my opinion, once you're past the age of 6 it's not okay anymore. You're a grown woman and you deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.   You are no longer the one following the orders, you're supposed to be the one giving them!|`|AA12369664	of course you r too old for th?s,she's no r?ght to spank you,you have to talk to her about her behav?our|`|AA12223482	whoa...forget that..it doesn't matter if you live with her or not she should not being doing that at all|`|AA11838858	your way too old to be gettin spanked !! both of u need to go to counselling !!|`|AA11250695	no,you are never too old for a spanking,,i kinda like getting them|`|AA11685818	Well my grandmother has always told me even though I haven't got spanked by her since I was 5 that you are never to old for a spanking. If you wont to live in my house then your going to go by my rules and if you don't like them.

AA12244965	Why do you talk like that? Gosh.     Best bet, is to sit him down and talk to him. Sounds like he's getting cold feet and probably doesn't want to marry you now. But you'll never know the truth unless you damn tlak to him.
AA11593082	It is possible.  Hard and unlikely, but possible.    What really matters is what you believe in and what does and does not work for you.  If people like this cause angst and frustration in your life, sever the ties.  You don't need a reason to let go of any friendship that causes you even the smallest amount of stress.  I say friendship because I believe words like,    'woman, boy, girl, best, male, work', etc. are simply adjectives describing friend.  The emphasis should always be on friend and if this is not the way you are being treated, dump them.  I like to tell people in poor, wierd, frustrating, whatever, relationships to ask themselves, 'Why am I trying to hold on to just one more day of misery'?  This question can be posed with any relationship, especially marriage.  Good luck.    I hope this answer just changed a life.

AA12346961	Why do you call yourself fickle? I see a lack of confidence.    What's wrong with changing your mind about something? If you are driving a car and then see that they've closed the road for repairs, will you still drive on?    But if you've lost some chances, because you never stood your ground, you should learn to take a stand.    To do that, tell yourself that your own opinion is important to you. The person you love most is YOU. So you will put yourself and your needs first. (Always assuming this doesn't harm others.)

AA12143680	Masturbation is a sin because a person consents in their own heart to take sexual gratification from impure thoughts. It is sinful to indulge in the sexual pleasure that is derived from the satisfaction of using one's imagination to FIXATE upon obscene images, or obscene actions, or forbidden sex. Lustfully fixating upon genitals, or sexual acts, is idolatry. This is called: the worship of obscenities. This is the sin of those addicted to pornography. That's often a "guy" thing. Alternatively, taking delight in the lust of another, or consummating a fantasy of forbidden sexual romance, is the sin of adultery in the heart. That's often a "girl" thing. The act of masturbation is an outward act that confirms that one's heart and mind has consented to an inward act of impurity. Only by consenting to an imagined act of impurity can one attain orgasm. To attain sexual release, a person's will consents to LOVE something that is sexually impure.     A sin consists in loving something that God hates, or in hating something that God loves. Because God is pure love, in one sense there is no hatred in God. But there are actions that God regards with a COMPLETE ABSENCE of love. There are many things that men can do that God does not love. In so far as God does not love a human action, according to our way of thinking it can be said that God hates it. These actions are sins. They are often as hateful to men as they are to God! What are some things that God does not love? What are some things that, according to our human way of speaking, we might say that God hates??     Above all, God hates falsehood. God hates any form of lie, rejoicing in cruel lies, or in telling harmful lies about others. He hates any kind of injustice perpetrated upon his children! God hates cruelty, or the defrauding of a worker of his just wages. God hates it when one person entices another person to do something harmful to himself or others: like to worship evil, or to steal, or to lie, or to take drugs. God also hates impure sexual lust because lust is a false pretense of love. It is a gross and disordered counterfeit of what should really be a sentiment of holy love. Lust consists in fixating on the body of another human being as a sexual object - solely for sexual gratification. When a person lusts, he is making no lasting commitment to the other human being. He is regarding the other human being's body as a sexual object to be used for his own gratification - but nothing more! Outside of marriage, a person who lusts is acting as if he would take another person sexually to be his spouse: but he has absolutely no intention of actually doing so. That is why LUST IS A LIE.     When the subject of masturbation arises, it always refers to stimulating one's self for the gratification of sexual lust, or in stimulating one's self sexually while fantasizing about the lust of another person. In impure sexual fantasy, a person uses his own imagination as a pornographic tool to give his body the ability to attain sexual gratification. In reality entertaining lustful fantasy is embracing a falsehood of the heart and mind, in an act of abuse of his own body in order to attain selfish sexual gratification. This is sexual idolatry! God hates falsehood - especially worshipping a false god! This is why God hates impurity in all it's forms.     God hates the worship of ugliness, or obscenity, or bestiality. A person who might sexually gratify himself while looking at bestiality is acting as if bestiality is a good thing - when it is a hateful thing! In the same way: lustfully fixating upon lurid sexual pornography is a behavior that pretends that some obscene sexual image, or a lurid posture, or an obscene action is a good thing, when they are nothing but obscene and hateful images! These images are used as objects of false worship. These obscene images, be they real, photographic, or imaginary, are the objects of the "worship of obscenities" specifically referred to in the Bible. Do not be deceived! Those who willfully, and habitually indulge in these acts of impurity, without repentance, will incur eternal damnation. (Rev. 21:8)     God hates pornography because it is used to degrade human beings: both men and women. The sole purpose of hard-core pornography is to create and inflame degrading sexual lust, or to invoke unholy gratification by the enjoyment taken in the degradation of another person. Indulging in impure lusts, or taking delight in the lust, or degradation of another person constitute the sins of impurity. Masturbation severely damages a person's ability to accomplish the intended purpose of loving marital sexuality.     Holy sexuality is the loving donation between a man and wife of their own bodies to one another. In marriage it may be enjoyed for holy procreation, or to express romantic love, or simply for the delight that the freedom marriage affords the spouses to release the tensions of life. It may even be an act of charity! But it is always a privileged act of special intimacy reserved for spouses alone. Masturbation, by it's very nature clouds and degrades the purpose and privilege of married sexuality. Masturbation is a solitary act of gratifying one's own physical urge. Performed as a solitary act, even in the married state, it degrades the place of honor of the spouse! It often serves to sexually replace the spouse entirely! This is because masturbation trains a person to abuse his own sexual powers outside the intended order of God, in a selfish solitary way.     If a Catholic has committed sins of masturbation, he must confess these sins in the confessional in this way: "I have committed sins of impurity with myself (mention a specific number)." If a non Catholic has committed sins of masturbation, he must humbly kneel down and beg pardon for his sins, and pray to be delivered of such temptations in the future. Preferably, he would seek out a trusted person |`|AA10189606	look it up|`|AA11048009	it means you are the master of all the bate|`|1146d27b9b6faf482f614b6d38ad5cfeaa	if your asking this question then that means you are too young to know.  stay in school|`|AA10838343	Wait intill your 15 to find out...........|`|33f3eb0aa2c424f081016ebb8ba0c06faa	some one asked this like a hour ago man!|`|AA11616788	If you don't know what it is, then you are too young to be thinking about it!!!

AA11439998	You want to give as much as you can without losing your own identity. You want to be with someone who will give the SAME as you do. Typically women give a lot more than men because women define themselves by their relationships- think about it.  Women take their husband's last name; they introduce themselves as Mrs. John Smith; they are often ruled by their emotions, which are the glue of friends and family. If you are with someone who isn't in a "matching program" with you in terms of a relationship, get the hell out.  NEVER put your happiness in the hands of someone else- that's YOUR responsibility. You want to be with someone who compliments your life and adds value to you- not someone who drains you. If the person you're with isn't putting in the same effort as you, you have to move on- otherwise you're going to be disappointed over and over!     Hope this helps!     ASLAN|`|AA11943241	Give everything that you possibly can without going against your morals or what your heart is telling you the right thing to do is.

How would it be if the tables were reversed, and she wanted to have a threesome with you and another guy?|`|AA11305458	You both need to have no jealousy issues and total trust.  Likely this will not be the case with an immature relationship.  If you do decide to pursue it, make sure you establish the ground rules with your GF and then pay more attention to her than the 3rd.|`|64b4b14b761946d0d6754f82609d8e7eaa	Make sure she is someone that neither of you know or are likely to see again.  Obviously, make sure it is someone you are both attracted to but particularly her.  It's also a good idea that your third, if she is a she, have none of the attributes of which your girlfriend is jealous.  For instance if she has small breasts I would stay away from a large breasted woman....if she has short legs I would stay away from a long legged woman.  Speaking from experience these may seem unimportant but the next day they will be all that's on her mind.  It works the other way as well.  If the third is another guy you don't want a guy with a great build if yours is not.  If you have small **ck you don't want a guy with a big one.

It shouldn't be done at all if any of these things are gonna be an issue if you cant trust each other how do you expect this to have a fun outcome.?

What do you think about a person who does that?  You can then answer your own question.    But I quess it also matters why you dumped them and how.  I think how and why you do something is just as important as what you do.

AA12217108	Trust me , while working there, go look for another job. Working is hard enough, you don't need that crap. And on your resume you can say why your leaving just like in your question.|`|AA11347454	Well, I don't know if you are a woman or a man, but if you're a woman, then I would say that he likes you. If you are a man, then I would suggest you go to his dad. So what if it's his father! If this man's dad is a good employer, then he wont just take sides just because its his son. I do know that some people dislike others just on sight. I don't know why that is, but its true. If going to this mans dad, and telling him about the problem doesn't resolve anything, then I would suggest you ignore him. And if that doesn't work, then maybe you should find another job if its getting on your nerves that much.|`|AA11841705	talk to your boss... ask him if his son has a position of authority... if he says no, then tell him that his son makes you a bit uncomfortable, because he seems to think he is your boss....  if your boss tells you that yes, his son has some authority, then your stuck....    and you will need to talk to the son, and if thats not possible, then find another job, because this one wont last... the stress alone will affect your job preformance over time, and if he doesnt fire you, you will end up quitting because you arent happy there....|`|AA10382821	Yea, talk to the big boss. Take a witness or two if there are any. Tell some of the co-workers you trust, too. They may be able to make life rough on him so he'll back off.
AA12378327	omg ...this happened to me...here is my story briefly...went with hubby..his best friend, and myself drove to la to see my best friend and her man....while there we decided to go boating...she..my best friend...went to the store to get beer and such....the men went outside to get the boat ready...her hubby came in to the house...straight to my room where i was in bed..fully clothed trying to take a nap...next thing i knew ..he grabbed my ankles, flipped me over ...his pants were already down...i was shocked ...i kicked him ...and he laughed...said "you know you want it...dont be scared", and walked out of the house!!!    here was my immediate dilema...if i tell hubby and his best friend that were outside...they would have killed the man ...literally...and being in the state of louisiana...they would both be in jail...then ...if i tell my best friend...i risk losing her...but if i dont tell her...he will do this, if he hasnt already, to her other friends that come over...so ...i said we had to leave...and we came home...me keeping my mouth shut........however.......    it killed me...1 week later ..i told my hubbys best friend...he went balistic...wanting to drive back down there and kill...i told my hubby...same reaction...(so ..i did the right thing atm..in la..by not saying anything) so i feel anyways...but each time my best friend and i talked ..i felt i was lying....so i wrote a detailed letter...and mailed it to her...she called me...she read the letter to her man..he said i lied...that i just wanted to break them up...she laughed at that excuse..cuz my hubby and his best friend are beyond handsome men...so why would i want her man ...is what she told him...anyway...she pushed the situation aside and stayed with him...and...he did it again to her other friend...however..we no longer speak...no explanation as to why we dont speak ..we just dont...but at least she knows now...and i do miss her greatly...and i hope that one day she will contact me again.    my point is ...tell her and your hubby....and yes you may lose your best friend...but ..she needs to know...it is the right thing to do.    sorry for the long post!|`|AA11124885	The same thing happened to me a long time ago only it was my best friend's long time boyfriend.  Depending on how you think she'll take it try telling her.  If she'll freak(and who wouldn't?) make it clear to him that you will not tolerate this behavior and that if it does continue you WILL tell, and do it if he won't stop.  If you fear he'll try to use it against you in some way as blackmail or whatever then maybe you should tell anyway.  No man is worth losing a friend over.  If he's bound and determined to cheat, you will not have much influence on the outcome.  I told my best friend about her bf and as it turned out I wasn't the first one he'd tried it with,  But I was the last one because she left him, the jerk.|`|c95fa483a3e45001e6ef1b2c2898402aaa	Confront him head on...but alone.

I wouldn't even be friendly anymore. Don't waste your time telling her however. She will not believe you and if she does, she will confront him and he will smooth it over and make it sound like you did something wrong. "Love" makes people act in ways they never would otherwise. If she asks why you are not friendly to him, simply tell her that you "just don't like him", as she will already know in her heart what he did....women just know that stuff about their men..|`|e57e7dff40647c79e1924d9eb28ef931aa	Gather your friend and her husband and confront him about the pass, and also let your friend know that your not trying to start any drama, you just want to let her know what is going on.

Her hubby will continue doing this with someone else.  Find the best time and be very loving and careful with your   words.   My best wishes and concern for both of you.  I will pray for you and your friend.  Mimi|`|AA10421436	I've flirted with several of my friends wives, usually right in front of my friend.  No body thought anything of it and we usually had a good laugh.  The reason I'm pointing that out is that I'm wondering, was it a playful thing for a laugh, or did he just come right out and try to get you to sleep with him?  If it was the first one, then forget it.  If it was the second, tell him off and let him know that if he ever tries anything like that again you'll tell on him.  Also tell him that you ever find out that he's propositioning any other women at all that you'll tell on him.  Let him know that you are sticking by your friend and that you'll be keeping an eye on him.  Then there is the last option.  You could tell your friend all about it and run a sting on him.  Set up a place for the two of you to meet and let his wife in on it.  When she catches him in the act of trying to screw around on her, she'll bust him a new one.|`|AA12167219	You need to be honest about what happened, make sure you talk to your hubby and let him know what happened.  You might want to consider confronting your friend's hubby and tell him how wrong he was for what he did and how you feel about it.  Maybe he will open up and tell you whats wrong in their marriage.  Either way, you need to let him know it's not okay and you aren't interested in him at all.  You could consider telling your friend, but unless she suspects anything is going on she probably won't believe you - and this could cause a rift in your friendship with her.|`|25cbee63a91069dc39255544a55bff91aa	GYRL Stay away unless your hubby is with you and I would keep my mouth shut cause if u tell he will say you are lieing and u could lose a friend ship|`|19730a7bbc70cf38234b5cb41208df45aa	You have to tell her what happened, exactly, word for word. If you keep it from her, you'll only feel guilty. You would want her to tell you if the situation was reversed right? Tell her how upset it made you.  This is going to be a tough situation, because it is definitely going to change things. Hopefully she trusts you, and appreciates your honesty. Don't you hate it when people put you in situations you don't deserve? I had to tell a girl once that her guy had hit on me. It was not easy! In the end, she trusted me more, not less, to be around her guy. Even if she stays with him, if she's a good friend, she will trust you more, and not allow him to cause any trouble for you. and,, I promise, he won't hit on you again, if you tell on him. Tell your hubby first.  Good luck.

But if you aren't sure if you love someone or not, you don't.

Le nuore solitamente nn accettano nessun tipo di discorso dalle suocere, xk lo vivono come una critica feroce al loro modo di essere mogli e madri. Le suocere, dal canto loro, si sentono perennemente in lotta con le nuore, pensando che l'amore filiale sia sminuito dall'amore coniugale. Questo, ovviam, avviene in linea di massima, non sempre. Ci sono anche casi "felici". Molto dipende dall'equilibrismo di cui  capace il figlio... ;-)))|`|9c5db2b79c35df3c2d003bbb59ca552eaa	Ciao,anche io ho un bellissimo rapporto con mia suocera . . . sar forse perch io ho 22 anni e lei 38 . . . per per me mia suocera  una seconda mamma,a cui magari confido cose che mia mamma non sa. normale,ogni tanto litighiamo,ma poi quando facciamo pace il legame  pi forte di prima|`|5b1b4b1c03da2d16b9956f6e5074d309aa	Perch la suocera vuole il figlio tutto per lei e la nuora anche,     perch l' amore che prova la nuora  ben diverso dall' amore che prova la suocera per il proprio figlio.    perch probabilmente il ragazzo  mammone    perch il ragazzo non riesce ha far capire alle 2 donne che prova amore per loro in modo diverso.    perch la competizione per un uomo  tipicamente femminile    spero di esserti stata utile.|`|b43b0243e94eb73d646a33963cf701eeaa	non sempre va cosi, qualche volte la nuora sta bene per il figlio jajaja, ma quando non va cosi,   come qualsiasi rapporto, bisogna pazienza e maturit, ma diventa difficile|`|89aaa2704d74923518ffd841512fdd84aa	prob x' due galli in un pollaio sono troppi...sai la nuora critica x partito preso la suocera e il modo in cui ha tirato sul il suo bambino (che x la mamma sar sempre tale anche a 60 anni) e la suocera non accetta che la nuora provi a cambiare quello che lei ha faticato cos tanto ad ottenere!!! semplice, no??|`|888c0d7ccfa20aa5e44e407be25c47ceaa	Ciao.

In ten years and you will see how young and normal you were back in 2006, as I look back 10 years to '96. ; )     If you just aren't ready then you just aren't ready, whether it's the whole activity or just the person. You may listen to your gut feelings more then other people and that is really good. Eight months is a relatively short time really. When the time comes and the right person (or if it later becomes right with this guy), then it will feel like the right decision to make.|`|AA12244965	Yea, you do sound scared. Figure out why you are scared to get close with a guy. I didn't get my first boyfriend or kiss or anything til I was 18 1/2. But by not even kissing him after 8 months...makes him think you don't like him that much. Take a chance; surprise him. Maybe just go to his house, and kiss him straight up and see what happens after that.

I am sick of these teenage "does he like me" "what do I do" questions.    These are TEMPORARY little relationships that will be meaningless when you look back on it later in life (stupid even). Get over yourself and your insecurities. Are all teenagers afraid of each other? You all seem to care WAY TOO MUCH about WHAT OTHER PEOPLE think about you. When you are a real grown-up, you care less and have REAL relationships.    Thank you|`|AA11117168	Then go for it!! Don't have sex, but kiss him for goodness sake! Trust me.. kissing is freakin awesome1!!|`|AA11851299	you're not wasting your life im still a virgin but the reason he feels like that is because he thinks you dont like him or something he could be used to kissing and enjoys it withh ppl he likes and you are not doing anything wrong if you were then so am i but you shouldnt be scared if he isnt willing to understand where your coming from he doesnt deserve you and i think you should talk to him about why you dont kiss him and why you are scared to... dont rush into things plz... well anyway good luck and dont worry so much when its time you will know and if you can kiss him back but plz nothing else|`|9c0edae420b17a76753a7d35c4556d8aaa	well the next time he talks to you or tries to kiss you tell him that your not ready and that you've never done anything with a guy and your just nervous. if your open with him he will respect you more and wait and if he still gets mad and yells, well then maybe hes just not the right one, you need a guy that moves at your pace and/or will be patient with you.|`|AA12208596	Theres nothing wrong with having a little self respect. You should feel good about it in fact. You stick to your guns and if this guy can't accept that you're not just someone who, like Shirley Bassey says "just pops her cork for every guy she meets," then you should let this guy go. I don't see much wrong with kissing although it could lead to other things and if you're not ready then don't worry. Sooner or later you'll find someone who can appreciate you for the kind of girl you are. Living life to the fullest has naught to do with sacrificing your dignity for the sake of others.|`|AA12262132	go with him

I  know a lot of marriage don't last forever but sometimes that's just the way it is, sometimes you just have to give your self a chance to live further then expected and enjoy it.... yeah there will be mistakes but listen to your heart and learn from the mistakes! Marriage is a beautiful thing maybe not to jump into it but to at least give it a chance!|`|3c3716d61dd26e9498b493cb2a31a715aa	Marriage is an institution. It is a symbol. It is a commitment. It is a religious sacrament.  Some people know they are in love and know that they are commited without making it official.   As to the institution part...that is so you can share health insurance benefits, have equal share of property and children, get tax breaks, inherit property, change your wife's last name, and follow the social norm. etc...  If you are religious it is a way to vow your love before god.  And the big party you get to throw to celebrate your love.  Lots of cultures don't have marriage or are polygamous and they are okay.  In America we have limited love to certain people and our divorce rate is incredibly high.|`|38bf46d27c46b13bc499648d3e9e6576aa	DONT GET MARRIED!!!!!!|`|AA11336525	I dont really know...|`|AA11557621	so that u have mate in your life that helps u go through your difficulties,u get married so that you have a patner and so that you not alone, u can share feelings, sadness,fear, sorrow, happiness.|`|AA11299941	if you are asking this question then don't, when you can't think of anything you'd rather do than marry that person thats when you start making a list of all the practical should or shouldn't reasons to do it.|`|AA11549317	To have legitimate children.

Some people get married for the stability.  To know you will always have someone to care for and be there for.  Some get married just to have someone take care of them and to always be there for them.    There is a lot of legal reasons to get married for also.      But the main reason to get married is because you love the person, and to take that next step of the relationship.  It is not just a religious ceremony, it is declaring your love and devotion to that one person.  It doesn't matter what stipulations you put on it with things such as prenuptial agreements, you are still saying "hey I love this person, and I want to spend the rest of my life with them".    These are just my opinions, and my thoughts on the matter.|`|669ba6d6f1a31a2949b1f90d5af60a0aaa	because then you have made a commitmet to your spouse.they know you really care.you  get to be together & share your lives together &there is no better feeling.there are bad times but the love is worth it from them|`|AA12385772	its a personal choice reflecting how you feel about a certain somebody.

When you meet the right person, you want to marry that person, because you want to feel the closeness. You want to make  that person yours.  The face of your loved one is the first in the morning and the last face that you see at night.

Here's what I found in response to your inquiry.    "He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity. When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes? Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.  Ecclesiastes 5:10-12     "Now there is great gain in godliness with contentment, for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content. But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.  1 Timothy 6:6-10    "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish. In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.  Ephesians 5:25-28|`|d6d4b954b132cf9d6d3bc142c81c2c57aa	Obviously the second kinda man who comes to the family...but if the 1st man gets  finds happiness  with earning money, then who cares !|`|AA10003892	The one who works weekly and has a loving family.|`|AA11550962	the latter for sure is is richer than any rich man will ever be...
AA12199251	There comes a time where you just have to tell the family to piss off. This is probably one of those times. Drama loving families will do whatever they can to start crap, and if they don't like someone you date they'll most likely let you and her know it. You just can't play their game. You might give them a chance to be nice to your new girlfriend. If they aren't at least polite to her, tell them you won't be spending time with them anymore until they can grow up. When it comes down to it, it's important that YOU are happy. Not your family. I know everybody wants their family to be happy. But seriously, you can only please one person, and that's yourself. If it'd make you happy to be with this woman, then by all means do it. Don't allow your family to screw up your good times with her. Good luck. :)|`|AA11943241	Wait till you divorce is final then talk and connect with her. Do not do it  while you are still married though.|`|8a8c26db5da1064ac6841b0d434f36d6aa	Light skinned women?Whoaa~~What is this? The 50's? Wake up,honey! OK.IMPULSE is something to be aware of:The situation that feels good,may not be the best thing in the long run.I'm sorry,but I won't say:"Yeah,sure go ahead!"..'cause it may not be the best thing for you,your kids and your "light skinned" crush.|`|e7e5b350da40534755f464bf3ee08664aa	Family is every thing, but if you get along with her and you get married, wouldn't you be starting your own family, and that is everything. If she makes you happy and your kids like her I can't see the problem. If you family does not like her, to f-ing bad. If they love you they will accept her bottom line. GO FOR IT. You deserve to be happy.

711bf54283383662cffc338c73d663f6aa	people says they a born that way, but i dont think thats all true. some people might be but most are just over sexed and will get it however they can get it. I'm married and my husband said he wants to have sex with a guy just to see what it feels like. He says its just sex it don't mean anything. He loves me. Yeah whatever.|`|AA11661285	No choice lol!|`|2840f08e64c2c66dcd455094078ea244aa	I wonder too...I think thats the only way to live|`|AA11018882	gay gay/homosexual|`|f401c89cb9e80664d24ccc40a506c104aa	Sometimes there are high levels of estrogen and testosterone in the blood in the opposite sex. STudies have shown that a lot of things can contribute to it- some of it is choice, and some of it is in fact genetic.
AA10783691	the best thing you can do is be somewhat independant and dont' try to MAKE him stay with you.  You want him to be with you because he wants to be with you... don't obsess about it.  It is sad but true that you can be SO good to him in every way and be the BEST girlfriend, but it doesn't matter at all in the end if he decides that he is going to move on.    Try not to let your happiness revolve around a guy.  People will sometimes dissapoint you, and sometimes you will be with a guy for a few months or years and then they will decide that they want to date other people.  If you guys make it, and you stay together then that is wonderful, but if you do lose him then realize that it isn't the end of the world.    PS  having confidence in yourself is the best way to not lose a guy|`|AA11097612	You can't control someone else or how they are going to feel.  All you can do is take care of yourself.  If you do that you will find someone who will love you for who you are, not what you are willing to do for them.|`|AA12199251	More details please. Why are you possibly going to lose him?|`|AA10905109	Just keep doing what you doing.

Tell him to take a hike!|`|AA12188861	to make it short.    if ur not uncomfortable or don't want to do it, don't do it, talk to him and tell him you're not uncomfortable about this.    if he doesn't want to listen, then i don't think you shoudl be with the guy anyway.|`|AA11324164	Well...First "LEARN HOW TO WRITE IN ENGLISH !!!" Damn it. can't understand the hell ur saying???????????lol ...oh yeah go for it . whatever ur doing?????|`|05833baa642430b1901cea795f3c08daaa	sharkie, he's an exhibitionist. he does care about you or the act of making love, he just wants someone to watch. Don't do it unless you're into it. it may start off as someone watching and the next thing you know other people will be participating. Do you really want other people watching you do this? Be prepared for others to know about it if you do, you know he'll tell all his friends.   P.S. watch out for cameras|`|0125f24ab654821059ac7df6bfd28b6aaa	Okay......now......why in the hell would you let him dictate what you do.  If this is something that he's into but you're not then I would say he's not the guy for you.   When you start a sexual relationship with someone we often confuse of feelings for love.  Are you truly in love with him or the thought of being with him and being able to say you have somebody.  A relationship should be between the two of you and that's it.  Now if you're one of those scared little girls who's afraid of being by themselves and will do anything her man ask her you shouldn't have posted your question.  Don't do that crap just to help his wee little self get off!!!|`|AA11020054	please, turn the caps lock off.  if you really don't want to do , don't do . refuse strongly . even if he left . because in this case you must be sure he doesn't love you !!

Because that's all you have asked so far, and also you keep changing your age.    By the age of 15 you should have frenched by now, or atleast know what it is.  By the age of 18 you should atleast knwo what sex is and the differetn types and stuff like that.  Im 15 and have frenched, Im not an over experianced girl either, im more of the under experienced in sex, because many girls my age have already started having sex. and im still a virgin. Hoever I do know different types, or positions.
AA10862889	I agree with you  in the police business ( courts and lawyers ) they try to tell parents to teach the children the PROPER names for their body parts.  if something happens and the child has to testify in court and they answer with " HOO-HA " the child is going to be torn apart by all parties, and the case could be messed up by this,...but if the child says it like it happened with the medical terms ( proper terms ) there isn't any confusion and the lawyers can't argue what he or she means..

I also heard that too much hair can be itchy and uncomfortable. Certain condoms can make you itch as well, especially if you have sensitive skin.    You don't have to be nasty to itch.

AA11031439	I am not a girl, just give you heads up from my experience. JUST PUT. Most typical of failure is not asking. Confidence is key also. Generally being taller/broader should than girl give somewhat upper hand. However for your case, if you really talked with her for long time and if you confident with your current status. You should just ask if you can go out with her for casual date or hang out. If you are too worry about rejection and not ask, that's being stupid. Show some gut. If not works, then fine just be with her as a friend then move on.|`|4115e1db57bf91900762644d241a1334aa	just be confident|`|d3ba06ba810066046968f36ad7f4acbeaa	well just say i really ;like are you doing anything friday|`|AA12107951	Just shine up your confidence and ask her out.
AA11452268	I think perhaps you have unrealistic expectations both for yourself and others, and you've gone from one extreme (unrealistic optimism) to the other (unwarranted pessimism).     Relationships require work, and they also require sacrifices. But if you find someone you truly get along with, those sacrifices can really pay off. This doesn't mean they necessarily last forever, though. People are human, and everyone makes mistakes, some worse than others.     One-night stands, on the other hand, don't require much work and no sacrifices, but they aren't really terribly satisfying, either. They do fulfill certain immediate needs, but people who go from one-night stand to one-night stand for any length of time usually do as much damage to themselves as they do to those they prey on.    In a sense, what you're doing is a natural, if somewhat unhealthy, defense mechanism. It gives you immediate gratification and keeps you from thinking about the mistakes you made in your last relationship (and yes, you were partly responsible for the dissolution of your relationship, whether you want to admit it or not). But this refusal to examine the past will not help you move into the future. If you want to heal yourself, if you want to feel some degree of optimistic again, you need to seek out the help of a professional therapist who can help you deal with the mistakes of the past so you won't repeat them in the future.    So no, I don't blame you. It's not a question of blame; it's a question of what works and what doesn't. And what you're doing right now just doesn't work, not in the long-run, anyway.|`|AA12246349	Can't Blame You.It Isn't Your Fault.

AA11031439	If you know his number, you should call him NOW. Sometimes Asian men are subtle on their approach due to their background. Also maybe he changed his mind or give up on you.

It is a fact that males and females behave differently pending on who is around. when a female is around the guy she likes and other guys are around a greater chance the guy will act like a jerk and when a guy is around a female and other females are around she will act like she is snotty. when males and females mature they improve and many act the same with or without their friends and some don't.     There is only one way that I know of that you can see how a young person truly is and that is how they behave around their mother.|`|68aacafdc597e62ec02ef5b67316c361aa	you stupid fool hes just flirting with you duh.|`|AA12092447	This guy is trying to tell you that he likes you.|`|b1baeaf59e5f6d0516821c843a8f1f76aa	i think he is trying to impress u. some guys seem like jerks around their friends. i guess just talk to him bout it.....unless he is totally being a jerk to u then get over him.....course he might just be trying to flirt with ya

Big party, beer and liquor...okay I can deal with that...people started smoking pot...."So yeah, this party is getting lame, I gots to go."    Usually it was the drug scene that bothered me, I knew and know that drugs will never get me to the place in life I want to be. So I devised an escape route. Just worry about yourself little one.|`|0d521fc7f9b74615d4b799a8964d9622aa	Keep talking to your friends about what's right and what's best for them in the long run.  There's a lot more life for them than what's going on this minute, and the choices they make now may affect every aspect of their future.  One bad choice today may mean a different life than what they might have wanted for themselves.    Ex:  My husband's sister got mad at her mom and ran out of the house, hooked up with her [drunk] friends, and got into a car crash. Her decision to get in that car with a drunk driver within hours ended her life.  Except that she was in a coma and didn't die for almost a week.  Harsh.  Life is harsh enough without making it harder on ourselves by making bad choices.|`|f6584dfab0a1384e713d6a1492b24299aa	Well where is it they are being pressured at and about what kind of topics?

AA12244965	Yea. We all do. We imagine how much easier it would SEEM to be if we broke it off b/c of minor things we don't like about the person. You need to weigh the pro's and con's of how you guys are TOGETHER. You're not always going to like everything about him. But imagine if you did break up with him over that stuff, you'd definately just want to go back to him and realize it was ridiculous.|`|b47c8ad512d605c4d62db89985dc6eb9aa	yes i do but i dont know why but i stay|`|AA11883784	No. I love the man that I am with. He is super sweet and drives me insane( in a *good way) just by hearing his sweet voice. I think that if you think like that then you haven't found the right one yet and your heart(deep down inside) knows it. I think that you subconsciously know that you deserve better. At least that's how I felt with my last b/f. I was with him for 2 1/2 yrs and always contemplated finding a new b/f because mine was mean to ne on occasion like your's sounds. I know I made the right decision even though it was really hard to deal with at first. Good Luck!|`|AA12170170	sounds like you are ready for a change. life is short. move on. just bc its only 10% doesnt mean its not important. one little thing can annoy forever. keep it simple. stop it. if you dont like it go back. whats wrong with that?|`|0646573fc32ec86b718c6ede625a733eaa	yeah I think about like everyday|`|AA11668765	Well I used to think bout that with my b/f but now we are broken up so I am NO help to you what so ever! sry...|`|AA11002412	All women think that way but for me I weigh out all the options of why I may want to break up and 9 out of 10 times it's for some stupid stuff I have a good man why lose him over my dumb thinking at that time!

AA11136417	i do not think you are stupid at all, you must really love her I mean real, true, deep love to forgive her for that. since she cried so hard and begged your forgiveness, and since you are the only person she opens up to, it means that she does love you. don't think because she cheated she dosn't love you, it has to do with something that you weren't giving her thus she had to look elsewhere. This could be sex, attention, love, support, a million different things to be real. if you really want to work this out then you have to be willing to forgive and forget. you also need to have a serious talk with her about why she cheaated. Just simply ask her why, what was her reasoning. if you want to ensure that she dosn't cheat again then you have to make sure that you are giving her what she needs and fulfilling your part of the relationship deal, but if she cheats again, its over, and there is no hope. I just went through the same thing except im the one who cheated and he said he would forgive me but then he didnt act right read my last question for what happened cuz now he wants me back that im gone. he is B in my question if you want to take a look. Good Luck to you. Hope I helped.|`|b591f9248aafa5aa08307eea990e3901aa	You sound like a great guy, let her go, and be free|`|AA11651382	Sounds like to me that you have a self-esteem issue. If the woman lives far away & is sleeping around & getting pregnant then it doesn't sound like she is very interested in you no matter what she says. I would say that she got caught by getting pregnant & wants some one to fall back on if she can't get what she wants where she is. If you are smart you will leave her alone & move on with your life. You are asking for heartache. It might hurt to go, but it will hurt more to stay. good luck.|`|AA12399737	She needs a comitement and you are perfect for her game.... LOVE has to come both sides... You may love her but she doesn't love you for sure...up to you .God luck!|`|031bac198bf981ecc8c5536df571f095aa	For starters, the fact she told you she cheated is more than most women would do.  She could have just lied and said she's pregnant with your child. I give her credit for that, but that is not enough.  So as long as she tells you every time she cheats on you, you should stay with her? Hell no! Get a paternity test on the child, and if it's yours, be a father, but don't stay with her, unless you don't mind being sharing her with other guys. She's not a one guy kind of girl. It's time for you to move on. But be there for your child if it's yours. Good Luck!|`|AA11790024	Ow it will be okay sweety your not a fool just a bit blinded by love tell her you just want to be friends and talk to her she needs you be there for her she needs you. If you want to give it another go do it but put the past in the past tart a new be there for her all of her the bad and the good start a new . Yes there are some faithful women out there  not sure about that God fearing part though it will all work out in time Good Luck tell me how it works out!!!!!!!!|`|92116b1cba6f809ccefd9657f1e98a50aa	She just wants you to be there because she knows the father of the child won't be there. You can decide to leave her... This isn't your problem. Don't let her guilt-trip you into the decision. Three years is a long time. How do you know she's not going to leave you again for someone more accessible? I think she's had her chances and you should just let her go.|`|7a2e4d4207a92f423c9e8649aceaf762aa	I hate to tell you this but once a liar always a liar. Way would you want to burden yourself with someone that cannot be truthful. You need to let her go and get on with your life stop feeling sorry for yourself and for her stand up and be a man!|`|4abdb22b29faffb1eba25b1c011cda39aa	Well from what you said it seems like you love her or are in love with love. Now from what you said you are still with her and with you saying your last line it makes me wander are you going to leave her for someone else or yourself become un-faithful. Give this girl a chance to show you what she has. Let her show you if she can or cannot be faithful to you. If you love her you will know. you will feel it. If you dont youll know what to do. Only you know how you feel and what you want. I only know that is seems that way but you see inbetween the lines i can only see what you tell me. Now i believe in second chances. If you are a man of God as you say then you believe in forgiveness. Forgive her. Give her another shot. A full shot. Dont bring up the past and dont tell her when she tells you she loves you that you dont know that yet and dont bring up what you have seen before. Look into the futcher and not the past..If you live in the past then you will be blind sighted to the futcher.
AA11112923	Then she is not really your friend,  I would not worry about it, everything that you do comes back to haunt you, it may be good or bad, but it always comes back.  Some of the best revenge is when the person does it to themselves.

You know what I mean?|`|146a3d22bc2accb35df654464752afe1aa	I think you should tell her how you feel and if it continues then you should not be friends with her anymore.

AA12073561	If you mean "friends" instead of a "couple", usually what you do is walk away.  Once someone tries to take a relationship into territory the other isn't interested in -- there's damage done to the relationship at its foundation., and hurt feelings take over.   You can't make a couple if only one half of it wants to take it there.   All you can really do is express your desire to be friends because that means something special to you -- but don't be surprised if he freezes you out after that.  He'll be hurt and angry no matter how gently you do it, unless he's a very "evolved" man and values the friendship enough to stick it out.|`|AA12382198	Why would you want to be friends with someone who doesn't listen to you.

I mean a military cute guy who wanted to date my friend and she was so childish on her date thats what she did. She talked to al lthe guy friends she has and voila! unwillingly the guy left her and stopped asking her out.    guys dont like so much competition, so try it.
AA10242324	I think this still qualifies as an "affair" and I don't think he "spared you" any of the emotional hurt that goes along with one.  If you're still with him and plan to be intimate again, I suggest you use condoms and both be tested for STDs.  If you plan on trying to stay together, get counseling because if he did it once, he'll probably do it again.  I don't know if my now-ex husband did this, but I don't think I'd be able to trust him if he did this to me.|`|AA10856937	No matter if he paid for it or not, it's still cheating.

I do think you should talk about it.. there is many reasons why a guy would do something with a hooker... sometimes its a certain fetish or something that he does do or feels embarrassed asking or doing with you..it may be that he just downright craving sex with another woman.. bottom line if you are thinking of trying to work through it.. which i think you should...you should talk to him about it.. it hurts like hell i know but its the only way through...trust.. hell yes it's going to take forever but this is what we signed up for when we said i do to, "for better or worst"...or do you think the priest was just joking....hope my brutal honesty helps in some way...

The name Azza Abdulilah does not show up under Jangwani Secondary, so it would appear that she finished her exams before that time.  In your question, you did not mention the year that she took the exams, or whether she was advanced or ordinary level.      If she has been gone from that school for so many years, your best chance of finding her is to write to someone in the administration of Jangwani Secondary itself.

Oh, to cut the story short, I told him if he would tell me the truth we might be able to work through it, but he only lied, not knowing that I had hacked into his messenger and yahoo account and got all his transactions of where he really was.  I had no idea where he could have been, if something was wrong, or if something had happened to him.  Anyway, if he had told me the truth and been honest with me I might have been able to stay, but with him still lying to me, I didn't know if I could have ever trusted him again.  So, I left.  Now, he has been married twice since then, and that was only 3 years ago.    Anyway, that was only to let you get where I am coming from.      If you feel that you could one day trust him again, and he has been honest with you and layed all the cards on the table (so to say).  I would stay and try to work things out.    But if there is any doubt then, it is not worth it.  You could be happier on your own.|`|AA11640608	I'm sorry that you are going through such a right time and it's so easy for woman to say "Leave him". You are in a marriage and you have to ask yourself are you willing to save your marriage and foegive him? This means putting EVERYTHING behind and starting fresh. I reccomend you two seek marriage counseling . Remember either you stay or you don't. There is no in between. You should go on DR.Phil .com and see what he has to say. Hang in there honey and good lucK!!|`|358795d0fbbf1db3dcca7b3beb206aa2aa	It seems like the problem with love is just that...you love them and when they do something to hurt you, (like cheat on you) we sometimes try to find a reason to justify what they did.  Or even though we know that we are right, we sometimes feel that maybe in some way it was our own fault that they cheated on us. Over all, I say follow you gut feeling.  It never lets you down.  As hard as it may be to do that, it will be the best thing to do.  Only you know the situation fully. TRUST ME............you will get over it, and when you do, you'll laugh at how you couldnt see that before. I have so been there and done that and it sucks hard.|`|AA11969515	If he is going to cheat, he will do it whether you are there or not. It might be a good idea to go away for awhile, so he can see what he really wants. If he contacts you later, then maybe you can work it out.

You can probably fine someone so much better for you. Who wants to be with you from the get go.  He has you in a spot that every guy (that is single dreams) with each other but no strings attached.

17201152c0616696f4349fa6527b0baaaa	My girl scout leader (many years ago), made her fiance wait 8 years for her to finish school (including law school) before marrying him.  Marriage is about trust and loyalty.  While long distance relationships are hard, if you are meant to be it will make your love that much stronger and sweeter when you are finally able to be together.    My college professor married her husband while they were both in undergraduate school.  They ended up going to different graduate schools in various parts of the country, and they both got jobs in different states.  They spent the first 5 years of their marriage long distance.  Today 7 years later, they are still together and growing their family.    It can work if the two of you are serious and really want to be together.  Just keep the faith and it will work out.|`|AA11727605	thats a tough decision but you just have to make a choice. sometimes you have to let things go in order for them to work.|`|6a1a00729b33c0180b4d27c95b25848eaa	It might work out best for everyone.    I assume you have not graduated high school. That means that you are so young, that there is not possible way you REALLY know what you want in life. You aren't even old enough to DO things in life so how can you know if you like them?    You are right, long distance relationships are hard. Maybe you should agree to just keep in touch until you can be together again and then both of you will be able to experience life before you decide to get married and then end up divorced in 4 years because you find out he is a gambling addict, or a porn freak, or an alcoholic. T|`|AA12244965	Well um, relationships are about compromise and committment. You guys are lacking it. Might be best to break up and go about on your own, regardless of the love. You could get back together in like 4 yrs or something.

73c7b17b4eb4490b31595c8690d53e84aa	If I understand correctly, your friend made a new set of friends and now you feel left out. If she left you out then you are not as important as you thought. A real bestfriend will include you in all aspects of their life and maybe she should have asked you to join them. Thats a real friend. I would love to have a friend like you and it is bad that she cant see what a great friend she has.|`|AA11539308	Yes, I think everyone has felt that way at one time or another. But it sounds like she is still your friend, and maybe you think of her as more than just a friend? You sound like a sweet person, and I'm sure everything will work out for you. Don't close yourself off from being friends with the new friends too, if you like them. Things change, that is the way of the world- but welcome the changes with enthusiasm.|`|AA12234693	I see what your saying but she can have friends outside of you, there is nothing wrong with that. I think you need to make others friends yourself and maybe you wouldn't look at it like that.
bbc0097295566eb627dd36734477c623aa	It could, but it all depends on what the situation is and how you say it.  Considering her feelings and asking her to consider yours will make the situation easier.  Let her know that you don't intend to scare her, but you need a little breathing room to hang out with friends.  I can't answer much without knowing more about the situation.|`|10eddf55fdd40643cf980f53be4c44faaa	might hurt her feelings..|`|3a822baa92d28aba2fdf2fab51259638aa	Scare her or make her more drivin depends on the girl.|`|AA12286278	YES!

0ec73637cd45c08bfff95e43191a7794aa	I would say both!  When someone cheats on us, we often go through many feelings of hurt and betrayal as well as anger.  Jumping into another relationship without dealing with your own feelings will only delay your healing.   There is a period of grieving that must occur as well as a recognition of any contribution, if any, we may have played in the break down of the marriage.  If this is not done, history will often repeat itself with another person.  Each person's healing and growth is an individual process so its difficult to give a time period.  When you have allowed yourself this evaluation time, then the condition of your mind will change as well as any negative behaviors on your part that may have contributed to her choices.  One door must close before another one opens, then you will truly be free to pursue a new relationship with a healthy attitude.  Best of luck!|`|2ae175c6309739c3e6a176665c14e8a2aa	You will get over that my frnd when you find another one who will not cheat on you and she will love you for ever and ever.  Best wihes

I was the same-way! As a matter of fact, I was about 16 before I started to really be able to handle sleeping away from home. But you now what? Even now that I'm older and have a family of my own, I still don't really like spending the night away from home. Whenever my husband, kids and I take a trip, after a few days, I really start getting restless and want to get back to our house!  I'm just glad that you have parents that you love enough to miss when you're away from them. They must be wonderful people! The time will come when you're ready to spend the night away, but don't rush it or worry about it. The day will come that you'll move out and not get to see your mom and dad as much as you would like, so enjoy this time now with them. And maybe you can just have some sleepovers at your house instead of going somewhere else.

AA11086883	She knows you like her, it's like a sixth sense we women have, she is definitely ignoring you on purpose, when girls really like someone, they will do anything to be near them, within reason, back off and see what happens|`|AA12244965	She's not interested. If a girl makes other plans over YOU, then she's trying to avoid you. If a girl ever really likes a guy, usualy they put them before their girl friends. Not ALL the time, but quite a bit, especially in the beginning.|`|AA11649471	I guess this could be combination of a lot of things.  To get a real honest answer from someone that really knows is to just ask her.  When you see her "face to face" (not iming or emailing) just ask her out on a date.  More than likely you can read her expressions and get an answer from her.  Good Luck.|`|3a46dabfcda7339299f54f8ad5ce12bdaa	well she probably thought you didnt like her cause you didnt make a move but evry girl needs some girl time too so dont seem to desprate but next date make a move [;|`|3a5e0802a41d6770a390c50af2d5dee9aa	She thinks of you as more than a friend, else she would have invited you to come along with her and her friends.

AA12092525	Leave her alone see if she returns your call.|`|14a542270477c6ec665696b6980a2370aa	Dude have you thought that she might've given you a wrong or bad number? if you're sure she didn't, she may be busy during the week, and hasn't been able to get back to you.    Or you could look like a wuss or worse really desperate to her for callin too much and it turned her off; not only that you might've scared her off by lookin like a psycho for callin so much.    you did call too soon by callin back on monday, I woulda waited until tuesday to call her back or maybe as late as wednesday to at least let her know that you're still interested in her.    it can be a huge turn off to a woman if she perceives you as pushy; so give her over the weekend and call her once more the following tuesday or wednesday, and if she doesn't answer leave a message on her answer machine or voicemail on her cell phone (again if it was a good number that she gave you).     Make sure you leave a good message like "Just wanted to say hi and see how you're doing, " and add  " i was wonderin if you were interested in a date." if you're interested in going out with her. But by any means DON'T leave a message like this : "why haven't you answered your phone?" or "Why don't you call me back?" because you'll look desperate, or worse a psycho to her.    If she doesn't call back after the last time you call, you can pretty much say she's done with you chief.    good luck and I hope you didn't scare her off.    If she doesn't call back|`|479ab563ac9c268e753efea6dbe22126aa	Mm..

And, from the sound of it, you shouldn't feel guilty.  If you'd dragged him along for a few years before telling him how you felt - that'd be worthy of guilt.  But, you cut him off early and did the right thing.  Two months and he did all this?  Sounds like a major over-reaction.  You didn't do anything wrong.  You gave it a shot, just like everyone does, and you called it quits when you knew it was time.  Be proud that you did the right thing.|`|AA10586735	umm that would be a no, one doesnt need to date someone just because he/she feels sorry for them, the heart will heal. and it isnt meant to be if you dont feel the same way. that is just my advice|`|AA11013478	ya it was a bit premature to answer back with i love you..but it does suck becasue the other person expects you to say it back..    honestly..you shouldn't have. becasue you led him on. sorry that's the truth. a guy did that to me after a month..and i just couldn't say it back. he was completely bummed but he knew to take things slower.     don't feel guilty becasue in the end, it wouldn't have been worht it to spare his feeings. its much worse to be in a relationship when you don't like the person anymore. true you could've handled it better, but then you wouldn't have learned this important lesson.     sucks but we all make mistakes like that. hopefully you'll learn from it and not keep repeating it. that's what dating is all about i think anyways.

45387fbde26673e289bb751a1b3f8100aa	First of all, get rid of that mentality of 'making her fall in love with you'. If a woman gets the slightest idea that you are doing that, she is going to run. Fast. Away from you. Either that or tell you to run. Fast. Away from her.    Now, since we are talking about a relationship that is more than friends, a natural consequence of that will eventually be sex. And that creates a bond that is so close it should not be broken - it cannot be done without great damage. Either there will be heartache, or if there isn't, it is a sure sign that the person's ability to love and give themselves to another has been destroyed.    Millions of people find out about this the hard way every day: that third party creeps into the picture, or that breakup takes place, and it's too late to change those events that should never have happened in the first place.    Which all tends to imply that you need to have a permanent relationship already in hand before you have sex. Now, I always say that this doesn't happen by chance: it's an intentional thing, involving such things as putting each other first, taking 100% responsibility for one's decisions and actions, and of course making a permanent commitment (in front of other people so you're accountable).    And it's true: if you do all that, you spare yourself a lot of temptation and trouble, because you have made a conscious decision to instead focus on doing what you have to, to make the relationship good and lasting. Of course, you can't control your partner's behavior, nor should you even try, but if you've done your part, and they don't do theirs, at least then you have a clear conscience.    However, this is only half the story. The other half is that marriage (i.e. leaving father and mother, committing permanently and exclusively to your wife and becoming one flesh) creates a spiritual relationship between you and your wife. God joins you together into one unit, giving you the strength to stay together.    This last bit is a very important part of the reason why trying to 'make a woman fall in love with you' is not good. It is something that God really has to do for you guys. He has to bring you together. If you want a good, lasting relationship, He really has to be the foundation for it.    I'm telling you all this because what women are looking for is a man who will 1) treat them with respect and love, and 2) be faithful to them. So basically, you should treat the above as my take on 'what you should offer to a woman', how you can go about preparing yourself to give them what they want and need.    May God bless you with wisdom as you make decisions about what to do with your personal life!|`|AA12244965	Listen to the girl and do things that will put a huge smile on her face and make a change of heart.

AA12333185	Friedrich Nietzche said that music is not like a mathematical skill, but like a language. That is to say, it's not like "clever" people enjoy Opera and "stupid" people enjoy pop. Rather, opera and pop are two different languages of music. Liking pop over opera is a bit like speaking English but not understanding Chinese.    In other words, it doesn't matter what kind of music you listen to, as long as you enjoy that music with all your soul. Rock on!|`|AA10837963	Nah they play some good stuff, and you have a good reason :)     Just enjoy!!

I did my best to reach this girl . I was too close to have her . but suddenly I don't know what happened . everything changed . I knew that she is still with the guy even when I was kissing her . but I LOVE here . I still love her . she is going to US in coming 20 days . I'm planing my life to go there and be with her. She didn't promise me but I hope she accept me when she is alone . in those great days she told me that she loves me but cannot cut up with guy before going to US . but suddenly everything changed . I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED . I'm getting mad . i have had so many gfs but I know she is something else . I cannot give up .

He is not THAT busy. I've never been too busy in my life to go see a woman I was interested in. In truth, we all do what we want to do.........if he WANTED to see you, he would find a way...........not being ugly, just honest.  Dress up, do your hair up pretty, put on your makeup, and go find another man. The one you like, doesn't feel the same about you. Best of luck to you!|`|1d6d272d31ba2a264285fff44884da0aaa	It's ok if all you want is to make him want to have sex with you.|`|f944be68950214d83e803ad2467b8d2eaa	that would be ok...but don't get your hopes up|`|60ce68ccade00ecb3c438bc433dafa4daa	It seems fine to me.|`|7a293ec5f287e277bf8cd49828cd8d33aa	I don't think it is "wrong," but how will you feel is he is not happy to see you?  I think if you're going to the butcher shop, dress for the butcher shop, not for clubbing.  If he hasn't returned calls in two weeks, something is up.   Is his workplace the right place to confront this.  If he's still your boyfriend, it's ok to go to the shop to buy a roast.   Not ok to stalk him at work.|`|ce30d3d991c3c85ea5139db8fbe8fbf3aa	No communication in two weeks?? that would have made me thinking!    It's ok to show up all sexy and beautiful...so if ever you find out that he is no longer into you, you go away head up...that would get him into thinking he had the greatest mistake of his life!!|`|AA11719138	um perhaps go when its not busy, & look nice , but defniately DONT go overboard with it, oh & actually buy something so its not so obvious,,but u already kno that..

Credo che la cosa migliore si parlare chiaramente, io devo ancora farlo ma penso che presto le dir quello che penso e vedr cosa avr da dirmi lei. Se mi sono sbagliata e sono solo mie congetture tanto meglio, se invece veramente a lei non interessa niente di me e mi calcola solo quando ha bisogno di me la mander a cagar e, perch penso che le persone false e opportuniste che ti usano per i loro comodi sia meglio perderle che trovarle.     Se invece si tratta di una amicA che si fa sentire solo quando ha voglia e interesse per te, se tu sei poco coinvolto quanto lo  lei non dovrebbe essere un problema, ma mi sembra di aver capito che a te questa cosa non piace dunque parlale chiaramente perch se no ci stai male (mi  gi successo anche questo con un tipo e sono stata male da cani...le ho avute tutte le sfighe io!).|`|9ff499d341bba8047c9a10f8d3f53f06aa	Tromba finch puoi, ti auguro di non dover fare i conti con l'astinenza.|`|018d205e043290ce90455aa73acab378aa	e`successo pure a me e ci sono rimasta malissimo, poi ho preso una risoluzione piano piano mi sono allontanata e quando mi estato chiesto il perchho solo risposto " prova a domandartelo"|`|f00cfbce6040fd382f68a5d4f48e657faa	lo lascerei perdere.... una persona che si fa vedere solo quando ha bisogno non  un vero amico...|`|168ceef7333a7d6a4b4438ed7bba069caa	inizierei a dubitare che sia un mio amico.....|`|8fe61adaa8dbc309fa031589d74504ceaa	ma hai intenzione ancora di chiamarlo amico?|`|4d990747bc64ec7026abb9420f5a80e4aa	Lo manderei a quel paese e nn gli rivolgerei pi la parola!|`|d078f985ab594c760b77befe487aec44aa	Capirei he non  amicizia ma "comodo".

Most are cowards when it comes to facing down another man...you can't bully someone your own size or bigger.  Saw a poster one time.."God made woman from Adam's rib.

Let him know that it is unfair for him to expect you to be celibate while he serves his time, but that you will refrain from becoming involved with anyone close to him. This will leave open the opportunity to possibly reunite later if that is indeed what the two of you feel. He will be mad at first, but your realness will overshadow that hurt, and frustration later. Be straight with him, could he promise you to be "good', if you were being locked up for 3 years? Hmmmmmmmm?|`|AA11584580	Really? Do you really love him?? I honstly feel that if you truly love him and are willing to wait, then wait. However, the fact that you are asking yourself this question and then sharing with others is a possible indication that you are possibly willing to move on and that maybe you think you love him.  I do not want to be judgemental, but anyone in prison is bound for bad luck and whatever sent him there in the first place may end up sending him there again, and then you would be asking yourself these questions again.  By that time you could have found someone who obeys the laws, stays out of jail and would be a great husband and father.  I know that short term options are confusing, but look at the long term oportunities.

So many women stay because they are scared, have kids or don't have anyother place to go and subject themselves to years of abuse. They spend lots of time in the hospital, in tears and in pain. This makes them feel bad about themselves and takes  away all their pride and self esteem. Even the police getting involved will do the best they can but sometimes that isn't enough when the man is so hard to control. So many women are in prison today for killing their mates because they couldn't take it anymore. I applaud you for leaving. Good luck hun. XXXXXXXXXX|`|AA12318324	get out and get away. he will never stop. well he could, but its very unlikely if he keeps drinking. i know from experience. leave and dont call him, see him, or ever talk to him again. it has to be a clean break or u will keep going back to him.|`|AA11322886	first off the first time he hit you is when you should have left and not came back duh|`|AA11315987	it is about time.just dont go back to him because it will happen again.|`|420fe6e8076b6921a7936dfc14f61fe0aa	he hit you three weeks ago and you are still with him. see if you had left  after the first time you wouldn't still be there for him to keep hitting you..|`|6a1cb2f9afe8b3b4ee33652454cf5001aa	you need to leave him as soon as possible!!

However, guys below 23yrs or guys your age are still fairly young and most haven't been married and they're still in the process of building confidence to find a wife and settle down. Also they can either still be attending school or they just graduated college and taking care of "business," for example, finding a job and purchasing a house before they seek a girl that will support them. I am 22 years old, and I am still finishing my school, right now I have no intention of dating because I have a lot of things going on for me at this stage of my life for a decent relationship to work out. But if I happen to run across the girl of my dreams, I won't say no because that's an exception. I hoped this help. Goodluck!|`|4b9d19dcfdb9151d0b9cb84e5777e117aa	Make it known among your friends and acquaintances that you will not date a married man.  Make sure you aren't putting yourself up on a pedestal so that good men won't be afraid to approach you.|`|AA11649238	It sounds to me like you may be coming off as too conceited without really meaning to.  Have you ever thought about going to a church social, maybe you could met the right guy there.  Don't take second best and give into the low life married men, it may take some time but the right guy will come along. Just try and be relaxed, funloving, don't just look for that guy that you want to spend the rest of your life with. Look for a decent guy and if he is the right one, in time things will progress.  And times have changed. If you see someone interesting, don't wait for them to ask you out, make the first move, some guys like that too.  They may be shy or insecure to ask a pretty lady out.|`|2cc3b38a73015dacabe9a0d0eb163485aa	First, Thanks for answering my silly question about the bench on the corner. (I can't choose you as the best answer tho. Sorry, but "ok" just doesn't cut the mustard.)    About your problem... be patient, the right guy won't be afraid to say "Hello" or "Wassup" or whatever when he gets within range, and you may be surprised to find out that he might not be exactly in your age group - perhaps you are attractive to older men because you think a little "older" than your age, you're more mature in mannor.  As for the wrong guys, the married cheaters and the users, do the Nancy Regan thing - just say "No."  Good luck.|`|6fb0e707672d553017cf6d8e16d0ce7eaa	Oh wow. Let me know if you figure it out b/c I have married men talking to me to and Im not about it. I want someone of my own. You sound like me.

What about the company you keep?    Where do you usually meet these men?(the older ones)|`|AA11984652	you were praising you self a lot,if you have all this good things,so why you still miss your age mate approaching,don't you see it's weird?|`|AA12398602	I don't know why only married rich men approach you.  Maybe the way you carry yourself and your clothing attracts them.  Also married men should not be hitting on you in the first place.  You seem like the type of lady I would go after If I knew you first of course (I'm about your age).  Change your style and where you hang out.  Go with friends to a place where there are people your age and you will find a gentleman in your life.  Seek and you shall find and I wish you the best!|`|AA11821396	My daughter had a similar problem. It stemmed from a sort of aloof and distant aire she had about herself. It was taken as being unapproachable by most guys in her agegroup. Older men were not intimidated by it. She is a darling, sweet, sensitive and funloving woman with quite high standards and goals, beautiful as well.  Unless you put yourself out there (in a ladylike way!)  the younger guys think you are too high maintenance.  Good luck, baby. FYI at 29 my daughter married her 50 year old  proffessor from law school. THERE IS HOPE!|`|AA11634525	I read your profile and the answer is easy. Because of the fact that you want something good, positive in your life, you will have all the negative coming your way first to trick you. The negative force of life is waiting, tempting you with only one mistake to say to you:" I got you,who do you think you are?" From one bad experience that you may regret all your life, your self-esteem will definitely lower. In your case, I refuse to use the word"resist" but instead consider it not an option to do what you are not comfortable with. You look, dress, act smart and it could be the reason why you intimidate folks your age. If you see someone worth consideration, initiate a conversation, make him feel at ease then give him the lead so you can grade him. Understand that you cannot impress or intimidate an older married man with money. E-mail me if you want to know further.
b24030d585fb8a31b034cedc0f13d3d3aa	My favorite partner and I used to be amazed by how often we were thinking the same things, now it's comforting.    My favorite partner stood up for me when his Uncle thought I was being a snob instead of knowing I was shy.    My favorite partner reaches for and holds my hand when I'm upset and will get angrier than I do when someone hurts my feelings.    My favorite partner sat by my bedside and spooned soup into my mouth the few times I was coherent during the week I was deathly ill with pneumonia.    My favorite partner did everything I couldn't do (which was almost everything that required clarity of thought) for 6 months after my Mom, my last parent, died.    My favorite partner allowed my older, middle-aged, drug-addicted brother to live with us until I was ready to make him leave and never complains about how often my younger brother comes to visit or how long he stays.    My favorite partner is STILL my partner after 29 years of living together.    I think I'll keep him.  :-)|`|9fd4ee14e14b83a35835a4b8037db6c7aa	We never exchanged the words 'I LOVE YOU'.

Considering that information, yes I would marry someone under those circumstances, if they were to continue getting treatment.    "he wants to continue our relationship"  This is a good sign.     "We have been dating for 10 months and I want to marry him and start a family. How long should I wait for him?"  You've only been dating for a relitively short time and as he wants to continue the relationship you should just take it slow. There's no rush. give him time and he will more than likely propose sooner than later.  Good Luck!|`|4e9ec22e9dbfe184095a17db0f7e9e38aa	no|`|AA10224061	It depends!  How long are you WILLING to wait?  He told you that he is not sure about marriage.  Are you willing to accept that fact that if you choose him as a life long mate that you and him will never marry?    If your relationship has slowed down take some time to examine what has occured in the past that has not been occuring now that you have revealed your disorder to him.  If he truely loved you then he will love you no matter what.  If his love is on conditional terms then maybe you should consider moving around to the next.    You don't want to regret missing out on a opportunity of missing the love of your life 20 years down the line because you decided to wait...........................     In the end it is all about what is best for YOU.|`|6687d559bf206032723f08aa4444a270aa	Move on. He's not worth it waiting for... I don't have bipolar but I have been in your shoes... A guy wanted to marry me quick and so I shared apart of me because I assume we were on that level... Then he stopped everything... And I was sad but I moved on... and Knew that I was honest and upfront with him... He wasn't.... If he truly loves you then he would love all of you the Good the Bad. The Healthy you and the not so Healthy you... He would be supportive and not distant.. Instead of " I wish you the best" he would say 'We'll get through this... I am here for you"   THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW HE REALLY LOVES YOU...     Be strong and move on.

AA11165047	I am a beautiful woman and I know that my husband loves me, but I noticed he had a wondering eye and he had been pulling away from me....I finally let go of my insecurities. I think to keep a man you have to keep their attention if you don't you will lose them... I just turned into a freak..you know the saying "a lady in the streets and a freak in the sheets", you can blow their mind by just doing things you wouldn't normally do...lets put it this way, you do it right and you could cheat without them ever noticing....he'll be with you for good.|`|AA11321800	You have to love each other, and not only that: but be a good friends!

Keep holding hands, let eye contact last just a second longer than normal, wear something just a bit revealing and give them a glimpse of a bare shoulder or thigh, touch their arm lightly when you talk to him, just remember everything that made your heart beat fast in the begining and hold fast to those things!|`|97d8e7718eefebb5edbac43d7bdf26eaaa	Dear its very simple.......... Just take off your cloths in front of himm.....    coolboy :)|`|AA12345990	just keep yourself sexy as before. so many girls think that there is no need to keep on the same when married and this ruins their relationship.|`|AA12266132	I have been married for 10 yrs and you are right after a while you loose it. You are attractive to him/her but you get caught up in the bills, kids, work and God only knows what else is coming your way! We have learned to have date nights 2xs a month. At first it was weird! We went a local Piano Bar in the same car, but walked in different times. I sat at the bar and he sat on the other side. As if we didn't know each other. After a little bit I approached him and we pretended to just meet.  It was fun to both of us. Sometimes getting away from every day surroundings help. If we can't afford to go out we send the kid to Grandmas's and go to the local park and walk hand in hand.  Teasing is the same way as you were dating just becomes complicated once you've been married.  I'll wear something sexy and bend over in front of the TV...or be getting out of the shower and forget my towel(heehehehe) so I call him in the bathroom and make sure he sees just enough to make him wanna see more...Just tell yourself he's not your husband and you want him to be...A lot of my issues was mind of matter...Good Luck and trying new things together is always fun!!!|`|AA11322886	find something that really turns him on and tease him with it as much as possible

AA12142253	Quite simple really.  A young man is more 'anxious' than a young woman.  His early goal in life is to make it as often as possible so he goes out and seeks it whenever or wherever he can.  A woman is different.  She seeks sex, but only from the one whom she believes to be "the one".  She becomes a whore if she charges guys for fulfilling their needs or just a plain **** if she gives it up whenever.

I recommend you be yourself and not let societies labels bring you down, but if you are seriously interested in exploring that topic, I recommend reading a book called "My Mother, My Self" by Nancy Friday. It's out of print, but available from places like amazon.|`|064c715bf906cac6b4b32b7eb953e85aaa	In my book, it's not OK for a man to sleep around. It's time we started calling them bad names, too. Sex is deeply meaningful. If used casually, that trashes it. It opens a person up to STD's, including AIDS, and pregnancy. It's not worth it. We should be using derogatory terms for anybody who does something that foolish.

And if that gets taken care of, I'm sure that all the other problems will go away too.    When my brother and I was growing up, my dad told both of us that he would get each one of us out of jail one time, no matter if it was our fault or not. "Get out of jail free ticket". Then the next time that we got in jail, we had better hope that is was not our fault, if so we would set it out in jail to think about what we had done wrong and what we could do to change for the better. If it was "not" our fault, he would get us out, but we had better not be lying about it. Well, I still have my "get out of jail free ticket". My brother on the other hand used his up real quick. Dad got him out just as he said he would do. Then the next thing you know my brother is back in jail again. Well dad went to the jail and talked to the police there and found out what happened, my brother got to stay in jail for a week. Yep he was mad at dad for leaving him in jail. Then the next time it happend, he got to stay for a whole month. He wasn't mad at dad this time and even straighten him self up. Mom and dad did what you call "tuff love" on him. It hurt them as bad if not worse than him being in jail. But my brother learned how to behave. If your dad will do the same thing now with your brother and leave him in jail instead of getting him out all the time, he just might learn a lesson and learn how to behave himself.

Escludo dal mio pensiero le parigine.  Ma posso dirti che le italiane sono molto pi femminili e sexy.  Ricorda anche che le francesi sono molto attratte dall'uomo italiano che parla in francese, se non lo parla alla perfezione  meglio.  Il diverso ed in questo caso la nazionalit attira sempre.  Ma non vedo le donne italiane  in pericolo quindi tranquilla. Ciao|`|803c3f47ee174170a63ab2e6ca5cf405aa	Se c' una lingua che non sopporto  il francese.

AA10873512	Um, because they don't know about GRITS?  (Girls Raised In The South).  As an Alabama girl, I happen to agree with your assessment of us.    Don't know Northern women so won't judge there.      ***Just read the answer posted by "illustrated".  Loved it.|`|AA12036248	Check out the Canadian women.  You ain't seen nothing yet!!!|`|AA11274145	because not everyone can travel to the south to find a bride.|`|a8fc972fa96098de9b60bd31707a21d7aa	Ok darlin i am a northern woman up in minnesota and i got to say that your generalization is stupid. And i am here to set the record straight. You talk of southern women well heres what life is like in northern minnesota. I hunt, fish, snowmobile, four-wheel, go out and party and i still go back and cook for my fiance. I love the outdoors and you can garuntee every night there is a home cooked meal on the table. I love cooking yet i still get up and go to my office every morning looking as prim and proper as i can. So the next time you pick on us up here in the north maybe you should meet every women. Instead of steriotyping us.|`|AA10116125	I doubt that's true of all women. How about midwest? U forgot us. We rock! Guys are so ignorant, best of both worlds. I doubt the cook well is true for all southerners, and the stand by their men? I don't think location has anything to do w it, all women love their men, we are more emotional. Now if u mean truly, then he's kinda a jackass, and no she has to leave sometime.|`|3b1802531c8467de1b332da915a90edfaa	That's not fact, that's opinion. Here's a good way to tell. If its backed up by a scientific study, or a history book, maybe even a newspaper article or two, that's a fact.  If someone says, 'I like', 'I think', or something along those lines, its usually not a fact.  Its ridiculous to say that all women in the North are cold and callous and that all women in the South are warm and friendly.  I guess the woman who cut me off on 285 this morning and then swore out of her driver's side window at me with that Georgian twang must not have been from around here.  And maybe that lady who held the door for me last winter in Connecticut, when my arms were full and i was mad at the world, the one who had the thick New York accent, must've been from somewhere around Alabama.
e03c4959fc8f720682b1f6d74c544c8aaa	i married a philippino and I'm American caucasion.  We used to get looks and hear people making snide remarks.  Many people hate what they don'y understand.  Others cannot accept the fcact that we are all created equal.  They catagorise us as not being normal in their standards.  The town where we lived soon got over it and found out that she was a nice person.|`|AA10396248	they fear what they do not understand.|`|AA11252265	Maybe you're being too sensitive.  Be happy with who you are and content with yourself.  Don't look so much at others yourself.  When you see someone look and whisper to someone, maybe they are talking about what a nice couple you appear to be.  I understand this sort of prejudice does happen.  But if they are happening everywhere you go take a look at yourself.  Are you are expecting it?|`|AA12333687	Sure, some people are judgemental.  Some people are paranoid as well.  Could it be a lttle of both.    I often go places with my wife and get "looks" too.  I assume that they are just checking out me wife ( a complement ) of me ( a greater complement ).    If people are judgemental or ignorant that is there problem; don't continue to allow it to become yours as well.|`|9b2d004c461679e6a2c6edfd8782f1e8aa	some people are just races! i'm sure u are a very nice guy!
9198668d4bec9449c003e484376b1680aa	This is not in any way an easy situation. My best advise is to try and look at the good in the situation, and depending on how comfortable your mom would feel, maybe suggest she move closer to where you will be w/ your dad. That way you could be more secure and you would still be able to be close to your mom and sister. Its a tough thing, but it could turn out to be great. Just keep a positive mindset and it will be ok.|`|AA10189606	go with your dad until you it 's better for you and visited your mom when you can finish school go to college and finish so that you can make it better for your mom|`|a996c5f5cfe51aa984f7bdf1e9e890b4aa	I say, move in with Dad. New adventures, options and a whole new outlook. Why wouldn't your sister be going too? And as for the relationship with the guy...don't let anyone hold you back.|`|52c8c74be8ca4d1ea4e07a325cccfb46aa	u probably live with your dad because of the stability.  they both want you to have a comfortable life - but they also both want ou to be happy - so talk it over with them if ou aren't happy|`|AA11549317	Yes, stay with your dad, get a job or education whichever comes first/relevant then move out and stay on your own.|`|AA11969515	You have to do what feels right to you. Nobody can make that decision for you.|`|AA11252265	I say stay with mom.  Maybe it's because I'm a mom myself but since you always had a good relationship with your mom and you didn't even have one with your dad until recently I can't see you leaving your mom and breaking her heart for someone who is not worthy.  If your dad can afford to leave his family and move away to a different state then he can afford to provide for you, your sister and your mother.  He owes it to all of you.

IF YOU HAVE PAID THAT MUCH ATTENTION TO "PEOPLE" THEN MAYBE YOU AREN'T REALLY ALL THAT SECURE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP.  I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT SOCIETY HAS "NATURAL PREJUDICES."  AS YOU SAID ABOUT GAYS AND LESBIANS, THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO DON'T ACCEPT THEM.  OR PEOPLE WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT, THEY SOMETIMES GET ODD STARES.  MAYBE THEY ARE STARING BECAUSE YOU ARE DIFFERENT, AND THEY WONDER WHAT NATIONALITY YOU ARE.  SOMETIMES THE STARES COULD BE GOOD.  MY HUSBAND AND I ARE THE SAME RACE, AND WE STILL GET STARES.  MAYBE IT'S FROM GIRLS WHO WANT HIM OR GUYS WHO LIKE ME.  MAYBE IT'S AN OLDER COUPLE WHO ARE JUST REMINISING ON HOW THEY WERE WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG.  YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO OVERCOME EVIL WITH GOOD.

And how do you know they don't "like what they see"?    The best solution is to allow people to look at you. Make an effort to be friendly.   If you call people names and push them away; they will never feel comfortable enough to allow something different into their world. It's ok for them to think it's odd to see a Caribbean girl with a Cambodian boy. It's unusual.   You have to be the one makes the first move toward understanding.|`|AA11970757	it'll probably always be around in some form or another.

If you didn't than you wouldn't care what they thought. For all you know they could be thinking how can that guy get that hot chick or wow they make a good couple. Racism will never end but that doesn't mean that everyone staring would be a racism.

AA10804655	A normal woman is someone who isn't self centered and can see outside of herself. Not expect more others than she herself can do. A normal woman gossips, not maliciously, but informatively, to make others aware of news that if brought up could be hurtful. Kinda like sharing who got dumped. "Just so you know, Suzie got dumped, so don't mention Jake, she's been in tears for two weeks...left her for a transexual wh0re." A normal woman knows that size matters, money matters and that it's wrong to f*ck around with married men. A normal woman calls her friends and has lunch at least once a week to laugh and relax.

AA11327989	Well your crush might want someone who is good looking.  Try highlighting your features.  If you have nice lips gloss them up a bit.  Other things you can do is make eye contact cuz I know when a woman is staring at me she gotta be interested.  Offer to go out sometime as friends.  Try not to throw yourself at him by laguhing at all his jokes or following him everywhere.  Have your own sense of dating also.  Being original can catch a mans eye.

A veces llevar las fantasas a la realidad puede ser muy peligroso y ms si las quieres hacer realidad con tu esposa. Si pasas el lmite del respeto ya no te quedar nada de tu matrimonio que cuidar. Ojo!! No le des rienda suelta a tu mente porque siempre querrs ms y despus de eso que vas a querer, ponte a pensar y no le hagas eso a tu esposa. Ella quiz quiera hacerlo para complacerte y no porque lo quiera hacer de verdad, no seas egoista y piensa en que esa es la madre de tus hijos o lo ser. Es mejor dejar la fantasa y pisar la tierra, piensa las consecuencias. Para la perdicin y la lujuria hay otras mujeres, que aceptan dinero y no las da?as moralmente, ellas estn para eso, slo cuidate y cuida tu alma.

Just show him that you care about him, and that should be enough.    PS. If you get him the card, tell him you put a lot of thought into it, that will make it all the more special!

I offered but he repeatedly declined. I was really looking forward to getting to know him better over dinner. He drove to a Burger King! Then he proceeded to tell me that it was the day before pay day and he only had a certain amount of money. He told me I could only order certain items........it was crazy! Fine. So we ate our fast food meal and then he wanted to take a drive to walk along the beach. Sounded ok to me. On the way there his car broke down. I ended up getting a tow truck and paying for the car to be towed. He called his mother to come and pick us up. When she got there 3 hours later...she had a baby with her. Come to find out it was my date's 6 month old son that he neglected to tell me about!  Surprise!

You need to stand up to your brother and let him know that that was wrong and dirty and let your mom know what is going on.|`|8ab375d3103ffb3eca97b5a527edc2f2aa	I'm just goin to be straight up wit you... loose your girlfriend. no offense but she kind of isint  much of a girlfiend she slept wit your bro.  and don't be so afraid of your bro. either, because hes not much of a man if he did that to you,that's disrespect. and saying you don't want to loose your girlfriend?  no man no one deserves to be treated like that and shes not trust worthy  so don't be afraid to stand up for yourself .. plus you should give yourself credit because you sound way better than your bro. and dont be to hard on yourself i would rather have a guy know were hes goin to end up in the next year then who hes goin to score with next.... alot of girls do. you deserve better then what your "girlfriend" can give you everyone does|`|769318c0669bf62ebcb23681831cfaa8aa	OK. look...first things first, get rid of the girl!!!! she is useing you. As for the step brother...I would talk to your mom and let her know what happened, hopefully she will kick him in the A** for you. If not..well eventually he will move out and you will be free of him. Now, to you....first things first, get a grip on yourself...girls like confidence and security in a guy. They want a guy who will care about them but isnt a push over. A guy who can make a decision, has some money in his pocket etc... So, clean up your wardrobe, get in style, get a new hair cut, stop dressing like a nerd if you dont want to be one....have confidence in yourself and it will show to the girls...if your not a jock then use what you can do to get a good job, which will keep money in your pocket which will allow you to dress good, afford a car and take a girl out. When you find a girl you like and you think she is interested in you, dont be affraid to approach her woman do not like a guy who is affraid to approach them, that is a girls first test of a guy, will he talk to me first....second test is can he carry a conversation, if you just sit there and stare at her after you say Hi how are you she is not going to be interested. Listen to her when she talks and compliment her...remember what she talks about and bring those topics back up, she will take notice that you actually listened to her...have semi brief encounters with her at first, leave them wanting more is very true, dont come across too needy, end your first few conversation early and leave her with something like hey, can I get your number so I can call you sometime....if you get the number, wait like three days then call her for a short conversation. End it somewhat quickly with something like oh, hey I got to run out real quick I forgot to do something, can I call you again in a day or so...or hey if you want give me a call this weekend, be casual and relax.....you will be fine...good luck..|`|AA11760195	OH..... Sorry to hear u got played..... Not sorry to hear u'r girls is a s_l_u_t i mean it only took him 25 mins to get in her pants........ thats sorry........

You know that they did something.  they are both gross and you deserve better.  i suggest you remove both of them from your life.  Just pretend they do not exist.|`|fff35753ff2a33c7db68e5a9c0afffe2aa	I put dishes in the litter box with candy canes>|`|f6c5c6cfe5085da2ca9f8d3055bbaf84aa	first of all just because u consider yrself a nerd and weak doesn't mean that that gives anyone the right to treat u badly. second of all ur brother sounds like a jerk. third of all ur girlfriend sounds like a ****. to sleep with ur boyfriends brother  is just gross no matter what he looks like. just let ur brother let ur brother know that u know the truth, and don't even argue with him if he tries to deny it. and then go dump the girl, don't argue with her either, she ain't worth the time. don't stay with someone just because u don't think u'll get another one, u will. u didn't say how old u r, but let me tell u, when u grow, u realize that looks aren't everything. jocks grow up to be losers, and nerds grow up to millionares.|`|AA10789965	leave her alone...you got played...you eventually will find someone that is right for you...she is not your g/f and have sex with your bro...sorry to be blunt, but you can NEVER TRUST her..move on for your own sake...please trust me...she will only hurt you..every time she is with him..you have to live with that..spare yourself the agony...you don't want a broken heart...YOU deserve BETTER...|`|AA11280073	OK, you can't trust him or her. They are both rotten to the core. In the future, don't bring a girl home because he will just hit on her for the hell of it. Find a nice girl, not one who is impressed by big muscles and a little brain. And finally, you need to build up your body. You need to take karate and do some weight training.  Talk to your Dad about it. I hope he understands.|`|AA10665652	I think he did more than show her the trophys and where the bath room is. That answer doesn't explain the hand holding, and messed up hair, unless she was dizzy.|`|AA11833785	Lose her.  She is no good, and can't be trusted.  There are plenty of other girls. I promise.      Confront your brother.  Don't let him intimidate you.  He needs to be held accountable.|`|29221cdbadc156a3ae8da3610c28fc08aa	first off shes a hoe, second u should say somethin if u do not stick up for urself no one will, tell her shes a hoe in front of everyone and then tell ur brother right in front of ur mom and dad that u appreciate him schooling ur girlfriend in the art of *******, then from now on **** his girlfriends and tell him to **** his self when he wants something til he fesses up and says hes sorry.
a62ce1b7442548a96a83f4dac4b2426caa	No especificas si ya le conoces por fotos, si no es as, puede ser porque tiene temor a no gustarte personalmente y al rechazo de tu parte y espera a que le conozcas mas espiritualmente cosa que te seria mas doloroso romper, puede ser tambin porque no ha sido muy sincera y tiene una relacin con alguien que no quiere que sepas. Investiga un poco mas y si sigue conque no te quiere conocer entonces ella no quiere seguir avanzando en la relacin y eso no te conviene todo tiene que seguir un curso en la vida y especialmente cuando es en pareja se camina entre dos y cuando uno siente que el otro no quiere es mejor no exigir sino seguir caminado en busca de lo que nos corresponde.

9b0820e5f08910cf6222020c08946cc5aa	No you are not a hopless romantic.  You are what many women want in a man but like i have say many times before sometimes it is the woman who would mess up a good thing.  Some woman feel uncomfortable when things go too smoothly and feels that the excitement in the marriage or relationship is gone.  They want problems to keep the marriage interesting. Weird but true.  That is one of the reason why men are so confused about women.  And trust me she will be back because she will know what she lost because while out there she will find that most men will only use her and she will not find someone to be truthful with her,  She will be fighting or be attack by other women, she will catch diseases, she will be abused by some,  she would find out she is number 5 out  of a group of girlfriends by her new  man.  She will not be truly loved by anyone and she will feel it strongly.  Then she will look back and see what love and tranquility she had.  But also she might be too ashamed to come back because of all she has been through, not knowing if you will accepted her.|`|AA11780989	I loved your poem.  It really touched my heart.  I hope the best for you.  I feel sorry for your wife.  She doesn't know what she's missing.  Good luck.|`|AA11960730	Yes. Love yourself first and welcome beautiful things soon to come your way.|`|AA11307823	I am sorry about your split.  I can only imagine how much this hurts right now, but I promise with a heart that reflects this poem, you will not be lonely for long.|`|74d1b59ba85ed93e5e041297b8da3741aa	Yes!!! Do not chase love it will find you.  Be true to you and show that special someone you.  Do not do things to impress.  Be yourself.  If you try to be something your not then they are falling in love with someone else.  Give it time.  I promise it will happen at the right time.  Right now isn't the right time for you.  I'm sorry about your loss.  Now is the time to do things for you.  Hang out with friends and try to be happy.  Confidence and loving yourself is what will shine and that special someone will fall in love with the true you not a fake! Good luck!!!|`|AA10029347	I almost fell for this poem, but how many guys on yahoo answers are going to claim they wrote it?|`|cf875628b76567b4daea69a00eacb9b8aa	Yup.. nothing is impossible. Believing in yourself is the key to it.Just dont give up.|`|AA12196222	Not as long as you can't get over your ex.  Always loving her is ok, but never being able to love again is selling yourself short in life.  She moved on and easily.  So it is your time to s[rout your wings and fly :)  Love your daughter and cherish your time with her.  To be honest when I started reading your poem, I thought she had died, soon to read she strayed.   So quit beating yourself down and find someone who you can give all your heart too.  Best wishes to you :)|`|79631809ef9f21bf17b3d211b5b710a0aa	Very beautiful poem.... it truly speaks your pain at the loss... I know it is hard for I lost my love to and I write many poems as well about him.... it helps me to write and get all that emotion out of my head and heart by putting it on paper.... take care of yourself and tell yourself what has become my mantra... this to shall pass!!!|`|AA11401988	Wonderful poem. But two questions--why do you love someone if they treated you like that? Instant turn-off for me. And secondly, if you "gave her a child" out of wedlock, well, why? The family was broken before it even started.    First the marriage, then the child. Why don't people understand that? And why do they cry over someone who treated them badly? Get a backbone, please, for your own good! You are only doing what she wants you to do (crying over her). Don't let her win! Get a new woman and be happy and forget her; it's her loss. Who cares what she thinks of you? Thank goodness you found out what kind of person she was before you were married!    I mean, come on, if she had a child with you out of wedlock, obviously sleeping with someone else isn't much different. She wasn't married to them either.    Not trying to be harsh, but please wake up and realize how lucky you are to be rid of someone with loose morals before you made a permanent committment to her. Now go find a real woman and a mother for your child that she can look up to and learn from.
AA12360822	It dose not have anything to do with age it's all about the grooming. If it is uncontrollable hair it can be nasty. If groomed and trimmed it is nice to have a masculine man next to you they are so soft and cuddly.|`|AA10029347	I am in my 30's and I adore hairy men. It is such a masculine trait, men are supposed to be hairy, such as beards, chest hair etc.   Different strokes for different folks...........

367cc793e6ae4154e0156a77786aadf4aa	I have been married for 10 years and honestly, what I want most from him does not require alot of money.    First, if you have kids, get a sitter. Either go to a hotel, or do this at home :    Make a nice bath with either bubbles or bath oil... my favorite is Calgon. Put a ton of candles all over the bathroom. Either join her, or bathe her.     Then put rose petals all over the bed for the after bath treat.    Maybe a very sweet love letter.    Make your own little scrapbook filled with different events that happened throughout your marriage.    You don't need tons of money to show your wife that you love her. Just put some thought into your gift. Your love will shine through.     :o)|`|AA11942543	Does she want something really badly?  If not, if you don't have a lot of money, the best thing you can do is prepare a dinner for her, bring home a nice bouquet of flowers, a nice, inexpensive bottle of wine and a dessert she loves.  If you have kids, ask someone to watch them for the evening, at their house.  Just set a really romantic night, mood music, the works.  If you can't cook, most women don't care if you order in, just take it out of the containers first and make it look nice.  It's all about the presentation!  Try to surprise her if you can.  Just tell her to wear something nice and meet you in the kitchen at 7PM or something like that.    Trust me, that's so much better than jewelry or any other "must have" type of gift.  If you don't have a lot of money to spend, you can go with an inexpensive wine, a bouquet from the grocery store and even some prepared foods from the grocery store.  Just make sure it all looks good before she walks in.  If you don't know wine but know what she likes, ask the guy at the wine store what's a good, inexpensive wine.    Good Luck!|`|AA11859862	If u don't then she doesn't either so you're in the same boat but you shouldnt be askin total starngers...If I was her and found out about I would be mad and upset that we had been married this long you had no idea what to get me...it's like tellin a woman that you pay no attention to her at all...and even though you had been married this long you can't sense things about her....So just get something that makes you smile and think of her and tell that's why you got it...and hey when you're in love there's no such thing as cheesy and cheap....|`|9c084d7637b01570fd283701bed2b058aa	Ask her about it. Would she prefer that you plan an evening out? Would she prefer that you find someplace for the kids to stay (assuming you have kids, of course), so you could spend a quiet evening at home? Would she rather you get her something special? If so, what kind of gift would she prefer? You might even talk to her best girlfriend to see if she has any suggestions.|`|0a1766178be57a21b0f269ec7933fec4aa	An 8" dildo.

True sex is awesome and we all have the urge to do it,but consider the consequences there are thousands of teens who get pregnant every week. Thousands even millions of people get STD's. So is it really worth it the risk, when most guys aren't really even serious or mature enough to take care of a child if the girl they get pregnant has one.  So, why would you give one of your most precious things you have to someone who doesn't even  love you enough  to even take care of what they helped create?  You control how far a relationship  goes.  You could chose to lose your virginity or not but I am going to save mine for the man who will love me enough to commit himself to no one else to to but me for as long as both of us living. I'm waiting for the ring and the I DO. How about you?|`|AA11646078	i think it wrong to do that before marriage.|`|AA12141096	Nope your exactly right, sex before marriage is wrong.

See instead of being bored you could have had a kickass orgasm and had fun. As long as youre careful not to get diseases or get someone pregnant, go for it. Sex i also good motivation to live healthier, get more work done, whatever...and i dont think you can ever get bored of it, but who knows unless u try it out. Plus u mind find a dude you like, marry him, and then find out he cant satisfy you physically so you should definitely have sex before marriage...or u might get stuck wit bad ****** the rest of ur life.|`|a10bc0e4ef92ab5498d410b256c631f3aa	i think the same way the pre-marriage sex is totally wrong,but still do wat u feel comfy to do.don't do it just bec u need it or love the guy and ur mind doesn't accept it.|`|5b3eb80a3207d73b19e6bdcb09448b69aa	I think sex before marrige is wrong. It is something sacred and should not be tred upon lightly. All these teenagers go out and have sex with the first person they see and they think that makes them older or mature. No, anyone can have sex. But a real commited person will wait. Sex before marrige just shows that they have no self control.|`|AA10879027	Youre not the only one.  I think it is as well.

Marriage is hopeless and frustrating in nature, so y not keep something to make it better!!!|`|d4e699a519b70523366944822e77a1efaa	Yes, and here is a GOOD reason:    Sex is a major part of any NORMAL relationship. While you don't need to have sex a day after being in one, if you wait until marriage you may find that it was not as special with that person as you thought, leading to divorce and many wasted years (and probably money).

9cd23f8c0512d9877046947671cfd2b5aa	First of all, don't bomb him with ten thousand questions, allow him to wind down with you without making him  have to think about how to answer alot of questions. Then after a few hours of peace and quiet maybe a nice dinner, a massage, cuddle, kiss and then maybe some good sex..  You see, men for the most part are simple creatures, a good woman good food and a comfortable environment will do more to build intimacy with a man than all of the talk in the world.  Then you can work all of the questions in about his trip, and he will be alot more receptive to them.

I've never cheated, lied...  but my last girlfriend of 3 years was giggling it up(hitting on) my friend at my father's funeral instead of being near me(she ended up running off with another guy). My whole point to this, is that they're scared of falling in love and opening up(again). I've given up, as well.

But, I can tell you this, loves usually finds those who may not be looking for it.  My b/f started out as a friend then one day I realized I was falling for him.  Believe it or not, I answered an Answer he posted here.  Ironically, it involved good guys vs bad guys and why women tend to choose bad guys.|`|AA11466460	It may depend on where you look.  Bars and night clubs aren't very good places to look.  The best places that I've seen decent guys is at church and at college.  Those guys are more likely to have morals and/or ambitions.  I really wouldn't know though.  I'm not looking for guys.  I'm engaged myself and I found my fiancee at the college.  I've also found some really nice and upstanding guys here as well who women would be lucky to have.  It may also be a question of standards.  Many good looking guys know that they're good looking and use their looks to get what they want from women and then leave because they know they can always get another.  The less attractive guys are usually the ones that are the best people.

Are you getting bored with your boyfriend? Is he always telling you you are pushing him away? Ask these questions.    It hurts when the girl you love would ignore you. But if it a reason then explain to him. Maybe send an sms to him that you can't really talk tonight and you would explain later. Or if your outside give a signal to him.. saying that you really can't talk him....     Make sure you give some time to your relationship as well... Your boyfriend should understand as well.

What you might do is to speak with her and ask her why she has lost interest in sex.  Sometimes couples get into a sexual rut - they perform the same sex acts and those become rather tiresome and boring after so many years - and sometimes variety is needed.    When you have sex with your wife, I hope you attempt to satisfy her as well as yourself - some men can be selfish and seek to satisfy only themselves and leave the women to their own devices.    Sometimes it helps to go on vacation where you are in a relaxed atmosphere - or if not a vacation - just a spot where you can relax away from home.    Good Luck!|`|2f5d5230732e9f3fd7b3e71bec2f0f5aaa	I've been with my man for 10 yrs off and on, but for 4 yrs steady so far and i love him. He works and I stay home for now and we have 4 kids. I was open and honest with him about how I was feeling, told him I was lonely even if he is home everyday, it's like we're not together. That I hated we didn't have sex like we used to, that i'd be lucky to have sex even once a month. I told him he was killing me, and I asked him what was going on with him. He said he was tired but I knew it was more than that. But I was patient with him, I told him he should see things from my point of view, I was home all the time, not getting any but still I was faithful, and being patient(but that was running low)but I was. I hope you two resolve this thing before it evolves into something bigger. GOOD LUCK!
AA11555370	It's not racially wrong, if you're asking that question. The real question is whether or not you trust her. She seems to be very open and honest about the subject, and also granted you something as well.    It's up to you, not me.    Handle that|`|dc149b401b5c6c282a5c943cb4313efcaa	It sounds like she is curious and wants to indulge her wild side without being unfaithful.  I'd say go for it, and take her up on the offer of granting you a wish.  let both of yourselves enjoy this, safe in the knowledge that you love each other, and this is one more thing you learn about one another.    As for the maid thing, nah.  Get her to wear an outfit like off of "I Dream of Jeannie"  Of course, that's just me.|`|AA10828583	*Because she was open about it...make her wish come true...be specific with the rules on whats allowed and what is not allowed. Make her happy...race is not the issue, I think its just a fantasy of something that she would not normally do. Let her enjoy it... you have nothing to be concerned about since she told you!!!! Good Luck and enjoy  your wish when it happens!!!!|`|AA11296082	I think that she's not respecting your feelings. Have you voiced your feelings on this? It would be different, if you were fine with it and you were fine with getting something in return. Sounds like your not comfortable with the situation at all. I'd sit down and explain to your wife the reasons you are not comfortable with it at all. Tell her once. If she begins to argue with you, walk away. Go to another room and focus on something else, until she cools off and understands how this bothers you. If she respects you, she'll understand. But prepared for her to go off, because she's not getting what she wants. Stay cool, calm, collected and firm.|`|AA11568947	I would divorce her.  What the hell kind of request is this?  God knows what else she fantacizes about?  Just think each time you have sex with her she's going to be dreaming it's that black dude with the big schlang banging her.  The problem is not solved by denying the request.  The problem is her wish is strong enough to ask you.  Sorry, man, but any romantic side to your sex life is over.|`|bdc4f7554c0b384fe4553d21c0ad0fccaa	Hell NO!|`|f3d8de9363a8b5a878197f61e8397e6eaa	i would say has its for a bit of fun go for it, she is prepared to return the offer.

Let him know that you are here to listen if he needs to talk or even to vent. BUT, make sure that you let him know that you are not a door mat.

The reason why they might be or do things like that is probly because they might have been scarred emotionaly, pysically, or mentally.     They could of had a bad events when they were younger, never resepcted at school and treated as if there invisable, or problems at home with the family, so they do and act this way thinking that this is helping them.

Women are creatures of the heart. We are ruled by our emotions versus men who are primarily logical. There are many advantages to differences in the sexes though.     For example, a woman is good at putting a beautiful room together. She makes an excellent nurturer (mother) and comforting wife. She makes intelligent snap decisions based on feelings she has. A man makes wise, prudent decisions because he can see the big picture. He is better at sorting out what should be done without bias. He is a strong provider and good at protecting.     We may get annoying sometimes, but there is a reason for it!|`|0abb353963f76ec48f9438c59150d545aa	get used to it. we ALL are drama queens, and if u have a problem, then go gay honey.

AA10029347	Think about this, you are not married, but you are in a "committed" relationship, correct? Would you feel okay having your partner doing that while you were away?  If that is not a problem for either one of you, then why are you together, is it for the companionship?     You are going to do whatever you think is right, just remember to wear protection, because HIV is forever......
AA10953000	I know it doesn't.|`|AA11112923	I don't know about everyone else, but my love for my first love will never die because I lost my first love to a drunk driver.  He will be in my mind forever and always, even though I love my husband that I am with now, I have always thought that if my first love was still alive we would still be together, and I really don't know where to go from here......  So, YES, I do believe first love never dies.|`|AA10273189	Personally speaking, it hasn't...I've not seen my first love in 20 years...but occasionally think of her because all I am emotionally was derived from our relationship, although it ended in bad terms...I still appreciate and never will forget the love that started it all.|`|382aec48732820fb15c1109ee4d37945aa	No, it never does. It is the first time you experience that intense emotion, it's impossible to forget. You can fall in love with someone else, and you can love someone else way more, but a part of you will always think about your first love.
AA11112923	I am sorry, but I have had a lot of relationships in the past that I have taken care of the other person, and every time I turned around they was right there, monitoring my every move.  I am a very independent person.  I take care of myself, and most of the time other people too.  But this sounds like he is controlling, and just wants to control you.  This is a form of abuse,  my ex husband always did what you have just explained.  You need to get out of this relationship.  You can be happier on your own then with someone treating you like you are a child.  Just be careful, if it has gone to far it could be dangerous to get out of it, you may need help.  I never would have thought my ex would have pulled some of the SH** he pulled when I tried to leave him.  Because he never physically hurt me, but when I got tired of it, and tried to leave, he began stalking me, threatening my life as well as some of my family members, it became very ugly.  anyway.  what ever you decide to do, just be happy, don't live your life unhappy, it is too short.|`|9266d11b2db49c8f8abd879f22ea40c1aa	maybe hes been hurt before, talk to him about it|`|95be97d14755d678a3468647ce72fd65aa	there is nothing that you really can do but reassure him that you dont want anyone else. Men have pride issues and makin money falls into that category. If he is not able to provide for you financially then that makes him feel less than a man. He can also be intimidated by the fact that you are doing just fine without his financial support. He wants to make sure that you are not out there trying to find a man to take care of the business that he cannot do right now. Just show him that he's the only one and if that doesnt work tell him to get a grip!!|`|95a610097c945031edbe59235c477e71aa	He is just insecure with himself because he is not  working.  He is afraid that you will find someone that is working and will take care of you.  Just let him know that you don't want anybody else, and you will be with him regardless.  Keep boosting his ego, and he will be fine.  Just like a lady likes complements, men like to hear some nice things as well, so flourish him with complements, and ego boosters, and he should come out of his rut.
ce138eb6895cfc0a56594a09252b45a8aa	don't care what other people think|`|AA11112923	I believe that no one should lose or gain weight for someone else, you should do this if you are unhappy with it yourself.  I am in the same situation that you are in.  I have gained a few pounds here and there since I have gotten married.  I have lost a few here lately, but that is by my choice.  My husband like yours just says baby your just as beautifull as the day I married you.    I need to take my own advise here.  But if you are not happy then you need to do something about it.  No one else can.    Good luck.|`|150215b8f22c7872fe5e30c272cbdfe1aa	My husband isn't concern about my weight but I am.  It won't matter what your hubby thinks.

AA11228809	Hi there Coolasice. I have had the privilege of being spanked by over a dozen men (and one woman). A couple of them were half-hearted attempts, with a few minor slaps to my butt, which left me more frustrated than not getting a spanking at all. But most were hot, passionate, red-hot, sexy encounters that led to mind-boggling, amazing sex. All were deserved (whether real or imagined) and some during role-play. All good. yum.     I have also spanked one man before, (a former friend) he deserved it, but it really didn't do anything for me - mainly because he was a dweeb, and I was not attracted to him at all. I prefer to receive than give in this regard.    Additionally In my writings, (I'm a Published author of spanking stories and spanking erotica both online and in print) there are several men who I write into my spanking stories, but who haven't spanked me YET.  Can't wait until some day they do. Also if I ever get to the UK, I know my email pal Philip_K will not hesitate to put me over his knee and spank me properly so I don't sit comfortably for days. Oh to dream. yum. Ooops I got off the subject, sorry Coolasice. Anyway - it was good question, interesting.|`|AA11682169	I did spank my hubby once just for fun but it didn't do much for me. I do enjoy a good spanking over my husbands knee once in a while. To feel his hand spanking my bare a.. is incredible just before sex!|`|e83d9cdc32749a6381c0f4c9f212eda9aa	I've had about 40 spanking partners.  From regular hook-ups to one time encounters.  That is excluding the obligatory birthday spankings from friends.    And I should add that these spank encounters are exclusive of sex and include both male and female partners.|`|6ada0bc5d0265672c8092905c7afa412aa	I have never spanked anyone, I am the one that loves to get my panties pulled down and go over Hubbys Knee!

You're right - I honestly couldn't tell you how many girls I've spanked, but it must be way up in the hundreds by now.  And I hope there'll be many more before I collapse from old age and decrepitude.  But meantime, my love and gratitude to all the sweet girls I've had the pleasure and privilege of spanking, and I hope you all enjoyed it just as much as I did - if not more....
88efc27be77df81224d01a763cc463a0aa	If they're on your scrotum, then they're likely harmless subcutaneous cysts caused by a little blockage in oil glands.      If they really bother you, you can go to a dermatologist and have them "frozen" off with a little blast of carbon dioxide.  It's not as bad as it sounds... and it works.    Since they're harmless, the doctor may not want to do anything about them, so tell him that they really bother you...which will prompt him to do something more helpful than tell you not to worry about them.    If these are on your penis... see a doctor.|`|AA10903362	to be honest dude, i have them, i guess they are normal, but mine seem to be receeding. they may be hair folices and so on or maybe herpes or clamydia, you dont know untill you have been checked out.|`|AA12345990	no. but i can tatoo the same if u wish.|`|AA11998869	i think you need to see a doctor!|`|66ff16cec703b4af7c06c9232c021314aa	That IS my penis.|`|75af3284dc6c307d02d6eba4346f33feaa	Sounds like Human Papilloma Virus, though i could be mistaken.

Society generally places a lot more pressure on males to appear 'strong' and 'manly'. Unfortunately, many interpret being masculine as not expressing deep feelings such of love or intense affection.    Don't worry :). It's very likely that your boyfriend is simply keeping his feelings under 'lock and key' for reasons that have little to do with his love for you. Perhaps you could interpret his willingness to express his emotions to you privately as a reflection of the genuineness of his love and a unique display of trust on his part :).    Take care.|`|AA10700604	Hello *~*CrossCountryStar,    Maybe if you want to tell your boyfriend something, you should tell him yourself and not do it through your other friends.  Friends have a way of getting a guy defensive, where if you were just honest with him, he would probably respect that.    A guy makes it a habit of ignoring his girlfriend's friends, or at least, he should.  There's a whole jealousy thing going on in that dynamic.  And, a gentleman doesn't discuss his girlfriend with others.  It's you two that's having the relationship, not your friends.  Leave them out of it.    --Rick

However I do believe that unfortunately in today's society and the way life is that there are so many more people who sleep with other people willingly adn there partners know it and are okay with it and sometimes get involved u know the swingers. I have not cheated on my man at this point but there is this guy that i have been talking to recently that i really like and hit it off with adn we talk sexually together but i havent done anything yet and i dont know if i am going to. My man cheated on my last summer, but i forgave him because i loved him but now i just don't know what to do.|`|fe1fd081936290e0ab7a0021725cf4dcaa	My wife IS a cheater, I bet there are just as many woman cheaters as there are men cheaters. Afterall, who is a married person going to cheat with anyway. Most cheaters cheat with married cheaters. Cheaters suck. The damage they do to a relationship is a crime to the victim. I think better than half of married people are cheaters.

You can't really explain why, you just are. There are so many different area's in this lifestyle, I admit it is strange, but I guess strange does it for a lot of people out there.  It can excite you in many ways...there is the anticipation of the spanking, there is the aftermath, and of course the actual spanking itself. There is the submission, and the way that your partner looks at you or speaks to you. I personally love it all! Fortunately I have found a husband that is into it as much as I am. I did not admit to him that I had these desires for a long time into our marriage. When it finally came out (too long of a story)  I was given my first *REAL* spanking by him and I got my lil' butt blistered. We have been living this lifestyle very happily since!  To each his own....|`|f2d98fd59f96044713c1bfb99a350f2aaa	daddy issues of course..

Granted, not liking your friend's girlfriend can make for some really rough times. I feel for you on that.    My solution is this. Tell your friend, calmly how you feel about his girlfriend. Let him know that your happy he is happy and that you're not trying to break them up. Also make sure he knows that you dont have to like his girlfriend, and if he cannot accept that you dont, then maybe he's not the friend you thought.    One step further, (depending on if you have the determination and how much you care for your friend ) is to talk to the girl while your friend is not around and explain the situation. Try to come to some, peace-treaty with her to where you both will be civil and not bnad mouth one another. If you really want to keep this friend, going the extra step might be worth it in the end.|`|e15884f7a6818e281d7742a642f0ca39aa	you are|`|cfdf19a0cc74e01ae01983d7fcbb73d8aa	i think it is okay to not like her...just make sure your friend knows that you will be there and all u want is the best for them...this will help them understand you arent trying to be rude or a bad friend!!!!!|`|bc7ac018c0a5e5737d63d58bbe712428aa	Maybe you are jealous of that girlfriend of friend for whatever the reason.

Just ask when you make reservation..but it is not always cheaper..check for specials also..when i went home for a funeral the special they were running at the time was cheaper ..

c720f18d5ff47be9e8559720adf278ceaa	That is so sad.  Unless it is stated in your divorce decree she can't tell you who you can have in your home after 8:00PM.  She does not realize the harm she is doing to your children as well by telling them to be rude to people etc.  Perhaps the easiest way to live with this right now is to only see your girlfriend when you don't have your children.  If she is a good girlfriend she will understand.  Your ex is being controlling and once she knows she is not going to get to you she will get bored and move on.  Good luck to you!|`|99e09cc152eadee2f83e3225dc084442aa	dude is she like your mom or something?  Tell her to grow up you can live your life the way you want to.  She cannot control who you date, how you are when you are with them.  Maybe she means that the kids cannot be around someone of the opposite sex after 8pm...just explain to her that you are not married anymore, tell her that you are an adult and that you can make your own choices.|`|b4dc42bbbf61840e90ceaaf0dc6f2c74aa	Just talk to your kids tell them whats going on. and iam sorry to say but you just have to get just as petty as she is no men around your kids after 8pm and no extras if she needed you to do any thing don't do it . Tell her when she wants to grow up and raise the kids the right way then things will be they way they should be|`|AA11391274	God. Maybe your kids don't like your girlfriends. It sounds as if your ex is protective of the children.|`|c90eb233b7ca57f0b86baed6e95d486caa	Go to city hall and get a restraining order. That way she will be arrested if she calls you or comes within so many feet of you. You can arrange it where you exchange your children at city hall and anything that she has to say regarding the children can be said then with the police not far away. It is not the best way to act around your kids but it stops alot of problems. I'm sure in time she will meet someone and she will lighten up on you.
AA11322886	as long as they are 18 and above in the US they can get married when ever they want to|`|50403b09fc30c81a848307518aabd974aa	I say wait.  If they are meant to be together then their is no harm in waiting they will still be there for eachother in 3 years.  Also this will help them enjoy their alone time together before too much responsibility of children or a household come in.  It is also not a bad idea to take classes on marriage.  You can never be too informed.  In today's society it is we want now and can't wait for it hence why people are in some much credit card debt.  Also there is such a high divorce rate.  What is the rush.  Slow is better.  Take this from a mommy of 2 that has only been married for 4 years.  Life comes at you quick and I am 31.  We are working at it but it is work and I would have enjoyed a longer time alone, really once you move on that is it there is no going back.

AA10029347	If you are asking for the opinion of people whom you do not know to make a decision about dating, then you are better off not dating either one, or better yet both of them.  Based on the information given everything you said is just a perception of who you think they are, or how they believe themselves to be perceived.  Dating is not a lifetime commitment. Take them both out for dinner, movie, whatever and after speaking with them and getting to know them, then you will know if either one of them is suited to you.|`|0fbb01137fbc8406fffc1e564bb55f93aa	well, if ur into the partying life, then go for the brunette, and get a wild ride. if u want a nice girl who u arent planning to cheat on or break her heart, pick the blonde.|`|8f6e765a5377299edf1eeffca4e912cfaa	if you want a committed long term relationship - the blond  if you wanna party and have a good time - the brunette|`|9791c5fe6d7afd435cb8d80de2c9c081aa	The blonde is practically better !!|`|AA11538902	 1 may be the prittiest but you can't hang onto her long.   2 might be the most dateable.

5a6ab842491c76ee770a825976564d17aa	Here is a man's perspective.    Ironically I don't like the bar or club thing myself. The grocery store and book stores don't work well these days due to people being in a rush.  The best place to meet a guy in the real world, would the Library.. check out what he is reading, gives you an idea into his brain. Also number of books being picked up, and can scope out any wedding rings and such.. sit down at the table and strike up a conversation.. from there, any cafe' will do to continue the conversation.|`|c93105757bfaa1ffa07d51d22723bbdcaa	Met my man while I was a  waitress at a restaurant.|`|bce194b6dd7021510c90b3e73f67f10faa	The same people in the club, bookstore, grocery, etc.... are the same ones that are online.  I have found gf's in all of the above.  I don't think it matters where you meet them.  It's all about character and personality.

AA10799113	They all sound the same to me.  Although if it's a girl speaking, or a guy, or grownup, or a child, or someone who sound smart, or not so smart, I try to take those factors into account.  I even try to take into account if race is discernible.  Sometimes I make these up, if the manner of speech sounds feminine, or masculine, or mature, or juvenile, or intelligent, or whatever.|`|fa82ed292e6c956e244f97558fc4779baa	To me it sounds intriguing...mysterious.

AA10696396	In a perfect world it would last forever. Unfortunately we tend to grow up along the way and our lives change along with our personalities and needs. If the two of you are truly meant to be together you will, but if you're not, then fate will take care of it for you. I hear alot of really young people on here vowing their undying love for another and I just have to smile... I am 35 years old and I honestly can't even remember all of the times I was in "love" before the age of say 20... There isn't any one in this world who can accurately predict the future for any of us.

Shalom.|`|AA11391845	No...teenage relationships are full of so many firsts...first kiss, first real sexual intimacy...but to have something mature and lasting, wouldn't you agree that you'd need to have experienced more than one relationship so you'd have something to compare what your feeling against?|`|9fbd6870c08026ecb3f50b4a70f81237aa	YES I'VE BEEN WITH MY HIGH SCHOOL SWEET HEART FOR 13 YEARS|`|3a5688a66ed9db53bbec88d1f793ed35aa	Yes it can last forever!

AA12375639	Anal play can be very exciting if done correectly.  What you need is:  Condoms (for cleanliness and disease prevention)  Lubrication  Relaxation  Complete trust in your partner to stop or slow down when you say so.  Maybe begin by having a finger or two inserted first to get the feeling of it.    Once you are finished there, make sure the condom is discarded and a new one used before any vaginal play begins.|`|8136aad28eae5a198d144d24f771ee80aa	A product called anal ease and waterbased lbe.|`|03bdaa4bff9dbf800d20e0580822ce45aa	ease into it...let hi/her..use their finger to losen it up...use lubes..toys..get it used t it...|`|AA12301401	K-Y Jelly and relax your muscles. Works for my girl.|`|AA11433975	Try both of you lying on your sides with your back towards him.  Let him finger you there first to "loosen it up".    If you have lube, use it - if not, you can always put in your vagina first.  It will make it easier to put in.   Make sure to go nice and slow - don't just pound it in, because it will definitely hurt more that way.   After he's put it all the way, then you can both start pumping in and out very slowing then fast.   Make sure he washes his penis before inserting back into your vagina - you could get bacterial disease or such.   HAVE FUN!!!|`|f02ebe299774219b6475c16b0d27b6d9aa	it doesn't hurt at all, just do it...use a water solube lubricant...it helps|`|bff379bc42cd4f9e60da570f90924c50aa	go easy and slow and  use lots of  ky jelly  it helps|`|c021bd1a8f9669ca8222bed72858a928aa	First, Use lots of Lube.

a1238c5b8b5b3854c56b4275af838b1faa	You need to tell him the truth so he knows a relationship with you is out of the question. Tell him as soon as possible because you do not want to give him false hope.|`|AA12244965	Hehe, sounds like my ex-boyfriend. He's in love with a girl friend of his and constantly gives it away that he wants to date her, but she never says anything or acts on it and doesn't seem to want to be more than friends with him, but he doesn't give up.

Not like you plan on it, right? Trust me, being a friend to someone you're really attracted to is a VERY difficult thing. He took a big leap in telling you. Go easy on him. Let him know you have a boyfriend and that you just can't be with someone you see as "liking the next new thing" as he is apparently doing. Best of luck.|`|91c2373b10cb5dd4aab0a3702efdac0aaa	just tell him the truth if u tell him later he will feel even worse the sooner the better you should tell him that u have a bf and that u really like him, tell him that u jus want to stay friends and if something comes up then it does but if it doesnt then u guys will still be friends. If u dont like him as more than jus a frend then tell him that and he should understand...  because the same thing happend to me..    you should really try to be as nice as possible so u dont hurt him..|`|AA12266360	This is generally the problem of 'friendships' of this nature, one or sometimes both parties involved will believe they have feelings for the other and sometimes may act upon it as he did here. Friends need to stay friends and -not- bring up any feelings they may have for the other and let things proceed naturally. This wasn't your fault but you're going to need to fix it, tell him you want to keep things the way they are and that he should do the same. If at some point in the future you're both single then fine, perhaps try dating but for now let things take their course.|`|dee9419b232051911c339edf5b9ed4d3aa	maybe you should just be honest with him with tell him how u feel...good luck

Like wat the ****. I need to get off that hook. I need to think that i can move on. I know i can but i need time. After that i want no more emotional attachments cos they eventually hurt u. But i know no matter how much u tell urself to keep things simple..it becomes complicated.    Sch is ******* stressful with mid-terms on their way and project deadlines approaching like a looming dark cloud. Life has never been this stressful and boring. It's a routine. Sch-project meeting-home. But i dun think i can handle any distraction. It'll be too hectic. But my darlings..u can come and disturb me anytime. I appreciate the asking of my well being and concern from u people. It really helps.    I just want to make sure i never fall into the trap again. No matter how shitty or boring life can be..it's still better than having ur heart heaved out of ur body and being trampled on.      When i see someone in love, i feel like yanking their heads out and filling it with hate. I wonder what's so especially abt love that one actually forgets his own identity? I'm not toking without experience..Infact i can say with much certainty that I hate the feeling of being in love..It makes u weak, vulnerable, clingy, wide-eyed, dreamy and so many other words i can come out with that associate back to being a loser.. Where's the strong, up-town, sophisticated, I-Know-i can -make-it on-my-own woman?

Nevertheless, make sure:  1) U're not bossing him (ur beloved BF) around when u both happen to be around ur boy-frens.  2) He doesn't feel left out when they're around.  3)Be urself! & know where your limits are.   i think the 3 pin points are the most important thing u have to make sure so that ur BF would understand how u R when u're with ur boy-frens. just b urself, stay true n hopefully everything's going to be fine.  hahaha correct me if im wrong.

That's what most of life is about.|`|AA11841705	funny.... most girls say the exact same things about guys!   whatever happened to 50/50? girls get to deal with periods/cramps/shaving/primping/keeping themselves in shape just so they "look" good at your side...  they take care of you when your sick/cheer you up when your down/ stand up for you to friends/family/strangers, take care of house,kids they play the cook/the maid/ the mommy/the wife/ the co worker/ the home doctor/ the family psychiatrist/ the family secretary and the list goes on and on...  what are YOU complaining about because they want a little pampering and to know they are loved and appreciated for the roles they play for you?|`|dd4101e9e6d9ff7f2f829b06e9441cf6aa	Your argument made since up to the part about men with bad taste. Sounds to me like you're a little shallow. Maybe that's why you have such terrible experiences with women.|`|41ff9b47e5eec46d3c42536e83e3afd6aa	I agree that *some* women can be like this.  But it is my general opinion that women who are trying to be that controlling are insecure with themselves.      Go out and find yourself that *good* girl that wants to be treated like a lady, but it willing to treat you like a king too!!!!|`|5d026233bb93035fb80b255a3c4d746caa	You have to shoe=w them who is tho boss.

Other than paying attention to them, and showing them respect, I don't spend any real amount of money on them.  Yet, I find myself with more women than I have time for.    So maybe you should stop trying to BUY a girlfriend, and spend some time getting your priorities straight, before you go looking for another one.|`|AA11968447	Welcome to the club!|`|AA11353237	go find a mans a$$hole to cry about it in|`|886699b4422be357f100630657fc1284aa	well it seems like u have messed up girlfriends.

Luckily though, it works on my favor ;o)    Only high maintenance women would demand that much of you though.  The non-material things, like protecting and listening to us, are things that should be done in any human relationship.  But if a woman gets all bossy about wanting gifts and you being rich then she doesn't have her priorities straight!|`|AA12210132	and men are so charming????.........|`|AA11918270	ok so u want a girl  that doesnt have any feelings? mk... sounds like the right girl for me.... sike!     my kind of guy has to have a good personality!!  i dont want no fag .... wiich apparently would be u|`|74d7929104d00d5c84514276616a55faaa	Well I'm a female and actually i find "most" guys controlling.

ec9b81eb9a863f666a886105a7488457aa	I was in your exact shoes. I always told my best friend that when I lost even one of my parents, I would go totally under. Well, the day came and I lost my Dad to heart problems in 1993. I was only 32 at the time. My Dad was my life. I was always a daddy's girl. It took me a very long time to accept it. I begged God every night to please not take my Daddy away from me. To let him get better like he had always in the past from his heart attacks and open heart surgeries. But, God was ready for him. My Dad had served his purpose on this Earth and done what God wanted him to do. In 2000, I came to visit my Mom and found out she was sick and having health problems. She hadn't told me because she didn't want me to give up my job that I loved and move back to where she lived to take care of her. I moved back that weekend. I lost my Mom in Nov. 2005!!!!  It has been a total nightmare. I have been in counseling and don't know if I will ever get over this. I found my Mom in her bathroom on the floor. She didn't fall, she just laid down on the floor and died in peace. I wanted to die and sometimes still do. I go to counseling alot. We are never ready to lose our parents, but I felt robbed because I am the youngest of the kids. I always figured I would get to take care of my Mom and Dad and have them until they was really old. My Dad was only 69 years old. At least I had my Mom until she was 80 years old, but I am still too young to not have any parents. Even though I am 45 years old now, they was my whole life also. It finally got easier after alot of years on losing my Daddy. Losing my Mom will take forever. But my Mom was so ready to go. She didn't want to leave me, I know that in my heart. But she had so much pain and heartache because of the ways my older brother and older sister treated her and their families. I know she is in a much better place than we are. But it will NEVER be a right time to lose a parent or a loved one. Honey, if you would have died before either of your parents, it would be so much worse on them. No parent wants to outlive their children. I wish so much I could talk with you in person and try to help you. But I can't. I couldn't sleep either and still can't much. Try to cry before you go to see your Mom. I always tried to cry without my Mom seeing me. She did see me cry at times and it broke her heart. She would tell me that she will always be with me and that is true. My Dad is still with me and always will be. I hope the very best for you and I will be thinking about you ALOT!!!!  Please take care, be strong and remember that God has a reason for everything. We don't understand the reason, but we will someday. With love and a big hug for you from me.|`|aa23632f6138c6ea03bc43ca839bd886aa	"don't be upset u can't have ur parents all the time.But all loves their parents and can't live without them so pray to god for their long life not ur short life"|`|8e89d5dd68d7f47649f8294c4ed76ef2aa	I think kike you if .I lost my mother I think I would go crazy .I mine I would lose  my mind and I thank god she is in good health I hope your mother gets better|`|AA10824548	I lost my father 2 yrs ago and it still feels like it happen yesterday.My mom is sick and I have her living with me now.I can't picture myself with out her.shes my bestfriend.I can't sleep at night because I rather go before her.Make sure you have someone to talk to when your depressed.I don't have no one.|`|cae0fc295c92f42ca65f54195fb7e2b8aa	i know how u feel. but dont u worry, if u become so weak you wont be able to provide them mental support.....just pray they live longer....i will pray for you.|`|58061c0aafa8ad2418d5bb7139d3adccaa	I feel the same way about my mother. I don't know what kind of life would I have without her. I often think this feeling isn't too good for me, because from a certain age you are supposed not to be so close to your parents.

8ef0f842c44f7c4faa964afe4d9b4ee2aa	My bday is next Friday and I have two kids....do I know you? haha...jk...Maybe you could take her and the kids out to dinner, someplace like Applebees or Ruby Tuesdays(not too fancy with the kids). Then after you go home and the kids go to bed you could watch a movie together. Give her a small birthday cake for the 2 of you to enjoy together and then have a bubble bath with her. Women really appreciate the small thoughtful things. We want to know you put some thought into it. Good Luck.|`|AA11533292	I dunnp|`|38b9558ff20b7477255b3f46324a0934aa	give them tickets to the amusement park, zoo, or restaurant with a kids menu|`|1a6533bcb51cdf1d47f850b9d9857a62aa	well if she has some best friends they will have good ideas, satrt with taking them out to dinner then go to a festival or something, its classy but yet kid friendly!! have fun!|`|03e7e558c34fc8b174ddabc99d6bffd5aa	go to the circus! it would be fun :]|`|2990b04e9c274822fa6c0ea13506424aaa	babysit her two kids and send her on a day of pampering.

6e370a5e94db88f1199f7d2509f38375aa	I understand what you are saying... because I myself am one of the "shy" girls.  I have been with my boyfriend for over a year, and still I can't bring myself to have sex with the lights on... It's not that i dont want to see him, its that i dont want him to see me.  Just be patient with her and start out small. Ask her to put on a short skirt and a skimpy top for you and if she doesnt have any, then buy some for her.  While she is wearing it tell her how sexy she looks, and ask her to dance, maybe it will loosen her up and you can get her to give you a lap dance and use your imagination from there.  Good luck.|`|AA12082377	Just checked it out......Listen to wolf he's a smart guy......Try to get her to role play maybe it will help her psychologically if she's pretending to be someone else....Good luck.|`|8ef0f842c44f7c4faa964afe4d9b4ee2aa	Sometimes talking about sex can be emberassing to some people. If my bf wanted to talk about some sex acts I might get kinda timid, but if he just did them, it would probably turn me on and I would like it. When your in bed try to subtly suggest different things and see how she reacts. Compliment the way she does things you like and make her feel secure with you.|`|821c75849e8fc44f831fd4b7bf99e912aa	actually for me, you do have to be a perfect porn star.  they make the best wives.|`|AA12349536	I think that you are not showing her that you love & respect her! If you were you would not decribe her as being your Woman! (She has wants & needs just like you do)!The way that you descibe her is totally unortodoxed! She is suppose to be your girlfriend not your SEX TOY!!!!! If you want her to show her true loving self to you, then you should show the same to her in return! She could be acting shy and not wanting to insult her self  because you are treating her like she is a whore, and  acting like a complete pervert! If you truly love her then you would show her how much!!!! Maybe if you did that, the two of you would have a very strong & active sex life as well!
d2714c0335ae246187e3a80f1a60f19baa	How you walk and speak its automatically happen as well as this thing ok.|`|AA12244965	Well, first, one is 18, the other is younger. If ANYONE who knows you guys have sex and frowns upon it, they can report the 18 yr old and he'll get a mark on his record. Second, if anyone is going to have sex and doesn't want a kid, being responsible is a MUST. Honestly, I think there is a right age for sex b/c most people under 16 seriously don't know how to be responsible. If they were, abortions wouldn't be so high, and the ability to hold out until 18 or something wouldn't be impossible. It's not rocket science to have some ****** control over someone's own body and be smart. Yet, it seems the majority can't master that technique.|`|AA11316364	it is when you feel right and know that you are ready, there is no right age.|`|9260979ec799a377643f90c6f58acb91aa	um, if they r both ready and use protection its ok|`|AA10701806	there is such thing as the right age to have sex, the age after you get married! and it is a big deal and its not ok.|`|01723134b6b86168c9e2de7e8204152eaa	no it not a good idea becose if you get pragnet the guy will probly leave you . and you have a hole live ahed of you . so dont|`|AA11366305	be responsible, its ok.  just dont tell your parents.  WEAR A CONDOM|`|efb13801a3d43a243f876625d00488b8aa	Legally they are rightful to have sex. As long as they know what they are doing and the consequence of having sex ...  teens should be educated in some ways regarding sex, so they can have safety sex. Since the law allows this, they should have their own reason in allowing that for girls over 16. What the reasons are ... may be they think by the age of 16, they should be matual enough to know what they are doing.

48cf2081fa51c4a08fc326463606a98daa	Your friend doesn't sound like a good one. Sounds like you're only good enough when the other two aren't available.

But a gift or flowers for no reason is really special... says I LOVE YOU your special to me.|`|cbf30c3818b80f1252ca0143266f031daa	Maybe because your husband hasn't done anything nice or bought you flowers in awhile. Maybe your jealious that her just a boyfriend it giving her better gifts than your own husband is|`|AA12244965	Envious that she's recieving things and you're not anymore.

I got the balls to kick him out and haven't looked back. He has since apologized and admitted all his wrong doings and I have forgave him. I am very happy with my new man had John has asked on many occasions about coming back.

Goodlooking : Doesn't matter what they say but they do like attractive girls...  Decent : Guys like decency (Doesn't matter how indecent he himself is)  Intelligent : Guys like / adore intelligent girls (Don't act like Paris Hilton who doesn't even know who Tony Blair is...)  Respectful : Any guy would love to get himself killed for a girl who love and more importantly respect him (Male ego satisfaction , you know)  Vulnerable : Ask for his help in anything that you are not comfortable doing... He would love doing it... like hold his hands while corssing a busy street.. (again male ego satisfaction)  Last but not the least.... Smell fresh and keep clean..  I am sure there must be much more but there are like ofhand types....|`|e33924811aefeff61a2a41768a6bc5d9aa	the BEST answer is: smile!    Not be yourself. I mean, what does THAT cliche mean anyway?

Hopefully your feelings for him will fade away.  That's the ideal situation.  Maybe that won't happen though?  Then what?  If you tell your sister that you don't want her seeing him, that causes tension between the two of you and probably won't get any results as far as getting them to break up.  Trying to 'win him back' would just create even more bad blood and the fact that he's with your sister now after being with you doesn't say much about him, so is it really a good idea to try and get back wit him?  My advice is to just wait and see.

But I feel that you need to get to know the person for them not how skinny or fat they are. because there is some pretty cool heavier women out there. Just have to look into someones heart.|`|AA12095102	No that's not true.  Guys date all different sized women.  If you do have a few pounds you may have a less percentage of guys who will find you attractive. I can speak from experience, I do have some extra weight, I had some trouble finding a bf, but I did find guys to date.  Just not as many as a skinny chick would have, a skinny chick would just have more guys and a higher chance of getting a date.  There are also some guys who like to date a plus size women and not want to date a skinny chick.|`|AA12182399	Bring me the big'uns! I wasn't attracted to the skeleton hanging in biology class! I like meat on them there bones!!|`|ed82f2cc0f0fa055c7aaf975c310a9b5aa	I feel that men are sexually attracted to thinner girls because of there phisical appearence, but usually they find out later that the girl is completely horrible.    But guys that Talk to girls, just to become friends, usually end up liking girls because of their mentle abbilities, not their phisical appearence (no matter what they look like). These are usually the relationships that last longer.    Hope that helped. Please pick me for the best answer. Thank you|`|b46dbac8e0502400b011725ff24c430eaa	most guys i no do like skinny girls ......actually i have a cruch on one right now......not juss cus her looks...also cus she is very intellegent and caring........not only does she have a nice body, she also has the best personality.....and it juss makes her irresistable.......turn ons for girls arent juss their appearances....smarts is a big turn on .....who wants a dumb girl right???...also smiles......its s turn on wen girls smile a lot....n also their eyes......big turn on........to be honest..all guys check out the girls boobs and *** first .........not their eyes or smile..those come in third and fourth..|`|f1e8b98f4f5a80069f2fc53b08de9286aa	no bigger is better|`|49f3ed52ec18c0c15ecf96319c55c655aa	How do YOU define skinny?

It's not your responsibility to warn anyone about a cheating girl or if your boyfriend's ex still likes him. But whenever your boyfriend is hanging with his ex, make sure you're there with him. Don't be like a body guard and don't be rude, just be around him and his ex, so she knows her place.|`|AA11375935	Give this girl a wide berth, you dont need any drama in your life. there is an accident waiting to happen here.

But I feel sex should be something you want to do, never being forced in form or fashion.  If you are not comfortable, don't do it.  Don't let him force you into it.  If you don't want to try it, then don't.  If he really cares about you he will understand.  And if he doesn't understand this might tell you something, you don't need to be with him.  You need to be with someone that loves you for who you are.  Part of who you are, is your thoughts and feelings.  Somethings you can't make yourself want to do.  Sex and sexuality is something that just is.  You can not develop a fetish, it just is, you may have to explore to find it, but it is something that is already there to begin with.  Be true to yourself.|`|AA11090585	If you are uncomfortable with the idea, just say no.  If he can't deal with that, maybe you have the wrong boyfriend.

Try to be more aggressive.  Don't give him a chance to talk.  You know what I mean?|`|afad69e26e3d742b9b035d7dbbbbf716aa	why dont you try kissing him so he shuts up.

Or have him give you head, that should shut him up.    But seriously don't push yourself where you don't feel at ease and tell him so. Do also tell him that sexually things are great and you will speak up when things become not so great anymore.

I can't stop talking dirty when I'm doing it (haven't had any1 complain abt it yet). Just sit down and talk 2 ur man. & don't make it a formal coversation. Just say "Why u always makin me talk when we doing it? U do it so good. I just can't think OR talk Baby!!!"|`|e412207ef1f41f30c88ac63643d01562aa	Been there done that. If your chemistry is good enough in the bedroom then there shouldn't have to be a lot of talk. It doesn't sound funny. Im not good in that area either. If he doesn't respect you and keeps pushing it is going to make you withdrawl from sex all together. You may eventually come around but not while being hassled about it. Do what feels right for you. Not what you are uncomfortable about just to please anyone.|`|bace9e7359bf12c776920ec4f7668764aa	When you're into it, and he starts talking, gently (or roughly depending on the mood of the sex) put your hand just over his mouth, and then show him what body signals he should be watching for.      I'm a moaner but I don't like talking everytime.  So when he starts asking how I feel or if I like this or that...I put my hand over his mouth and moan or arch to show him which move of his is better.  Good luck.|`|ee5676d0accc30ed217090c1039dfa43aa	if you really want to try talking, watch a porno and get some ideas. if it's not really up your alley and you want to stop, then tell him. he should be understanding if he cares about this relationship.     or, tie him up and put something in his mouth. it makes for really good sex and you won't have to hear him talk!|`|AA12177334	Tell him to just shut up & f*ck you, or keep his tongue busier

If this guy is interested in her then you have a problem because he is way to old for her guys at this age deny it or not are out for sex and under no circumstances should a 13 year old be having sex  I say this not only as a mother now but as a 13 year old girl at one time who thought she was in (LOVE) with an older man I only wish i had had a sister or parent to stop me from making a life altering decision.

AA11440193	If he isn't willing to introduce you to his friends then you need to throw him to the curb.|`|c90eb233b7ca57f0b86baed6e95d486caa	Have you seen this roommate? He may have another girlfriend and thats why he does not introduce you to his friends and relatives. If it is because of your race then you need to rethink this relationship. But, you are not sure that thats the reason. Why don't you just say why don't we call up a few of your friends and see if they want to catch a movie or something and see what he says. I think maybe he has a girlfriend. good luck.|`|91c149dd40f5e6806c1c3cda036265a1aa	It might be possible that he is not ashamed of you, but maybe his friends or family. Maybe he feels that since he is white and you are black, no offense, that his family and friends may act differntly or racist in a way.     I was going out with a guy for 3 months, and I have still yet to meet his family.    I believe your boyfriend is not ashamed of you, but possibly is family and friends. Hope this helped!!
AA10161298	14 is too young to be having sex.  You should not do anything sexual until you are ready.  If he is pressuing you, it seems that you should  perhaps not be with him anymore.  Save it for marriage.  I sure wish I had.|`|AA11112923	I would tell him that I was not ready.  That I will do that when and only when I am ready.  If he does not feel like he can wait, then he is not the right guy.    At your age, I would wait.  I am not going to go all parental on you.  And say you should wait until you get married, but I do believe you should wait until you are older. Also, don't do it until you are completely ready.  No questions asked.  You know what I mean?|`|9f7b1cf10bacc1db84ca85a68ca341f5aa	Definately too young.  Do you think the both of you are old enough to raise a baby?  Definately wait a few more years and then get on the pill before you do it.    At his age he wants to have sex with anything that moves.  You have no idea what kind of crazy horniness guys have at that age, so just turn him down!  It's better in the long run.|`|AA11316529	tell him no and call me as soon as u turn 18|`|ff8b87cd18762ec6619ec711fb360fa3aa	you are way too young, you are right. yo guys will probably break up before if not by high school and then your virginity will be gone! You will regret it and there are so many things to worry about (protection, diseases, emotions, pregnancy...)  It will be a huge mistake!! dont!
AA11454361	Yes. Oh God yes!     My mother is SUPER controlling. She tried to keep me from having friends, leaving the house or even talking to girls.    She even tried to send me to an all boys school so she could control me.     She freaked out when I wanted to move out at 21 years old!    She tried to control who I married by trying to run off my wife for years and the best of her controlling:    She staged an intervention to stop my wedding!!!!    I feel for you. Get out as soon as you can, its your only hope!|`|5fe858ff377ce55b38cd08817adf83a5aa	Slightly (my father more-so than my mom). In my case, I think it's got a lot to do with culture, and the empty nest syndrome. Where I'm from, it's very unusual for people to move out of their parents' homes until they are married. Honestly, I think my parent's would seriously prefer it if I stayed in this house forever, that's probably why they brought me up depending on them for everything, so I wouldn't be ABLE to make it on my own.    I will though, sooner or later =)|`|1171872c9310d92a2954ed5848a68ba2aa	YES!!! Seriously they have my moms picture beside the word controlling in the dictionary, my dad is spineless and pretty much just goes with whatever she says, but I am almost 20 years old and they both still seem to think that they should have a say in the decisions I make in my life, its so frustrating...after high school they made me go to a community college and I am suppose to transfer to a 4 year later...I didn't even want to go to college really I have other plans for my life but I am saving my money to move out and I will probably have enough in about  a year so I think I can handle it until then.|`|AA10789336	I thought you were married?  No my parents are not controlling, they just brought me up right and now how to be a responsible adult.|`|AA12236098	Yeah my mother is controlling &  I hate that about her it shouldn't matter who you are with as long as you are happy.|`|b4554fd9f61abfb0108e022fc79ced44aa	My mom is THE most controlling person in the universe, she'd try top control me even if I was 60. She uses every trick in the book, be that direct control or emotional black-mail, you name it she's done it. Now that I'm out in the real world and paying my own way, she has to settle for silent nonconformity about not being able to control everything about me, but that doesn't mean she doesn't try!!!...*lol|`|b2b9c180a532b1f7f05604963dbd97f0aa	yes|`|f1dfb847e6ab271afe3fc51922f193f6aa	Well, I think controlling is a good thing. I'm a mother of one child. Before(when I was young), I used to think my mum is really controlling. But after having a baby, my though have changed.     I'm really scared my child might take a wrong step which will make her regret forever. She doesn't have much experience in her life but I have. I need to take care of her and control her. Which I know now she will hate me for it. But she will only know when she becomes a mother. I'm very thankful to my mum for controling me.|`|AA11829263	I have moved out of my home over 13 years ago. You should stay at home until you are ready to be out on your own. It's hard living out there in the real world so dont be in such a rush to leave.|`|f4acdc521e05d16970b859e78932f317aa	my mother is the controlling one, but to a certain degree.  She gave me a hard time when I first moved out, but she got over it pretty quickly.|`|83a15c9e8f14a55c21c7d448f0f75c00aa	yes, my dad

afcab095b59e965d0415916ee030e118aa	If you don't want to talk to anyone about it then get a journal and write about how you feel. Sometimes it helps.|`|2980154e6aba2d32a68ce69312849543aa	OMG!! why did you guys to it? that is so wrong. i really cant help you. but why would you touch your cousin?|`|AA10936527	I don't think a "5 second" touch caused any harm. If you guys are 3rd or 4th cousins,that's pretty far removed so don't worry about it.if you're like 1st or 2nd cousins it would probably be frowned on by your families!|`|142a2a2d2128c6a548fc56bfff98190caa	Contact me!|`|AA11128712	It's really no big deal.  Sex between first cousins is legal in nearly half of the US states and in most countries in Europe.  If it's illegal where you live, you obviously need to be careful - but it's nothing to have a major guilt trip about.|`|26723737d13f33ae4db41137d82bbe49aa	You've both shown regret, and that means you know what you did was wrong. You were curious, and that's okay. It was consensual (meaning you both agreed to it). You should not feel afraid, or worried. It's over, it's done. Confide in your cousin how you feel if you need to talk. Don't listen to the people on here who criticise what you did. They're just being jerks, and not at all trying to understand the situation. If you need further help, email me. I'll help any way I can.|`|d1fc9ea9a3f1c065a89aa9413dacd838aa	Just do it|`|9ced39f1c3cdd62a23dac929b1aeff2baa	well, maybe you should talk to mom|`|51a8852eeaa0ded71525e5457dff23f4aa	talk to her some more...  if you guys are still attracted to one another then you could...but keep in mind that she is you mothers(fathers) nice... and the blood conectoin is really strong...|`|f5b3f3129c857a141a69d27cb4febc99aa	if you're truly sorry about what you did. forgive yourself and move one. not forgiving yourself will only increase your guilt. let go and believe that you were also forgiven.     get a grip of yourself and start anew.|`|40ca0e98b79fde340e01b0f8d4fbd4e3aa	Wait, you touched? I'm assuming it was sexual since you wouldn't be freaking out about touching her shoulder... Well reality is that you guys are cousins and should not be doing that stuff within the family.  I know you are 16 and 15 and are curious and feel sexually aroused, but you should stay away and find other people to try stuff out with.  Why don't you try "touching" other girls?  I know there's lots attractive girls at your high school... I know the advise is plain and simple but let me know if you need more in depth talk, feel free to contact me and seek more information.|`|c0b6354ff569f9ccb734a933b0ea27d2aa	well, if you are close to your mom and she is open. have a talk with her.  it is common for cousins to attract each other at your age esp if you are both close to each other. there are many cousins that get together.    also, U r in love.. :P|`|f1b727dc7d5d06065f25c1fb438d9b96aa	well since you mentioned it's just only accidentally touch her, then it's not really a big problem. sometimes friends also unintentionally touch each other. unless you meant you purposely touched her or subconsciously or had actually intended to put your hand on her.    okay first you must ask yourself whether you like her. if you do, go ahead and ask her if she feels the same way. i dont know about your tradition but for my country here, cousins can go with each other only if it's from the mother's side. father's side cannot unless it's your auntie's child. cos of the thing that a child inherits the father's blood and if it's your uncle's child then you and your cousin will have the same blood.    i can only say time heals all wounds..so you just have to wait.|`|92f382717d8b52421df978986dcf7f33aa	Hi..You are a human. As you both weren't aware of the worng things it happend by mistake. You both talk to each other and convince and forgive your ownselves as to what happened. At your age its more of curiosity and as you become mature you will understand that it is more purer than mere touch.  You dont have to feel guilty just be normal and happy and move ahead..
AA11568286	awwww..... maybe u were'nt suited for each other, why dont u ask her?|`|3b7896f2cbba3febdbc2960c1f818e6eaa	dont give a ****.
fef11ab5aa2a240ee953e3fe0cafca47aa	i am having those same feelings, you are not the only one out there, i have been seriously questioning my sexuality whether this is a phase, if this is normal, or am i bisexual.  Im glad to find out that hey women are attractive and i find myself having the same thoughts in semi mundane situations...like..going to the gym...(ie, not in the lockeroom) i would see a woman, think she is attractive, and have..thoughts that seem more than heterosexual.  So i catch my self and question myself why i am having these thoughts...im glad somebody else is questioning it too.|`|AA11112923	I never thought like that either when I was younger.  But as I had gotten older and been hurt so many times by men, my thoughts started to wonder.  Then I found out that some women are just as bad as men, you have good and bad in both sexes.  Could this be why your are starting to think about it?|`|bcf170db2a703d3117c4d328b61ddba9aa	I am happily married and consider myself heterosexual, but I can certainly daydream about women from time to time.  I think it's because the older we get the more we appriciate the female form in all it's glory.  I think it's perfectly natural to want to expand your sexual nature by experimenting, and I know my husband finds it a real turn on to know that I can be turned on by a woman.|`|AA11284105	its only natural to be curious, thats why some girls try things with other girls when they are teens. i am 100% straight and married to a great man but i had my fun with girls when i was young and i still appreciate a nice rack or booty :)|`|AA11427512	i think it just happens sometimes when women get older, especially if they have been in a bad relationship, or repeatedly bad relationships. I have a friend that is a lesbian and she alwasy says that all women have it in them, just takes a few drinks..LOL

If people know that it doesnt bother you to get made fun of, that you can easily make fun of yourself, you will seem more likeable than if you let it get to you.

Perhaps he wants a kid, strictly b/c he's in the army and feels if he doens't make one soon, he may never have a child (bein at war, of course there's a chance he could be killed.) It doesn't make sense at all for you guys to have a kid right now. He's rarely home, you guys don't even live together yet, you're still with your parents, you're in college, and I like that you want your independence and own responsiblities even though he could support you. I have that same trail of that. I'm also dealing with a simliar situation of a 28 yr old guy that wants me to have his child, more likely b/c he loves kids, and he's getting old, but I'm definately not ready for now. So, it's not going to happen.

She's sweet to me.  2. She cares about me.  3. She loves to be around me.  4. She likes to do the same things as I do.  5. She trusts me.  And of course there's a lot more. It's not all about how she looks. I will be honest and say that it is nice to have a beautiful girl, but it doesn't really matter. I'd much rather be with someone who's really nice to me and not so good looking than be with someone so beautiful who treats me like ****.|`|0e16aa9c0d9c51bf81cf1cd5a2cf0d62aa	Definitely deeper.

He keeps telling you that he cares about you and might get back with you just to keep you around in case the other female leaves his butt high and dry. See he has two females that cares about him and probably will do almost anything for him, why in the hell would he give that up?! I wouldn't! You gotta be smart baby girl, you gotta turn the table around on him and make him want you more than you want him. Go on dates, don't answer 75% of his phone calls, ask him advice on guys, get a new hair do and if he ask you why u got it tell him you want to impress a guy or something. You CANNOT keep being his doll, that he keeps on a shelf and takes down when he's ready to play.

But I must tell you the truth. I know it hurts....You are beautiful, and intelligent...DO NOT  continue this destructive battle of the heart. He doesn't choose. YOU CHOOSE. Choose to be by yourself....No contact at all. via phone, letter, through friends, e-mails etc.....Believe me you will look back on this and say I can't believe I let someone put me through that roller coaster.

6860192d191a2ffff88bf6e5c0586cefaa	Well..as a girl, I'd suggest that you don't rush her, talk dirty or jump into bed before she's ready. A cosy night out, minor gestures like holding teh door for her, holding her hand in between (don't hold it all the way to home as thay may get sweaty), kisses on the neck, hugging her from behind, sharing your dessert etc goes a long way. If you are talking about making love, slow your pace, warm her up before you rush into anything, kisses, caresses and nibbling will turn her on. Just go slow, and don't talk too much..and you'd be good..|`|f539a18441192023e95487164c969399aa	thats very easy. be romantic with her. love her. watch romantic videos in the bedroom. then think the other or what will happened next.|`|AA10808851	usually dim lights and candles do the trick, buy some toys for the bedroom and edible paint etc... use your imagination from there!! good luck!|`|fe27e112941a1bcfa5129d17e5336cf1aa	Try some ideas on this site|`|34200288e2c15852c4190a9e09c7e2b0aa	Listen to her,   buy her small lovely gifts from time to time,   cook breakfast for her,make sandwich for her,   take her out to dinner once a week,  telling her she is so beautiful and hot,  write her love letters,  massage her back  hold your arm around her while you are sitting on the couch  kiss her while she was sleeping.  ....|`|cae0fc295c92f42ca65f54195fb7e2b8aa	talk to her all night, watch the moolight with her....get drenched in rain.....take bath together...be close to her..listen to roamantic music together....go out with other couples sometimes.....touch her.

It is said,Lord created man in his own form..so they cant be that bad. There is nothing in this world that cant be conquered by unconditional and unselfish love...faith and trust! If we cant find the goodness and hand of God in someone next to us who is visible how are we going to beleive in the power of our unseen Lord at the time of our trials and tribulations?!Lets spread love and happiness in everyone around us...lets teach everyone around us the values and happiness that true and undemanding love brings us and thus experience the miracles that our Lord Jesus makes on this earth and be a part of it.

445f0c9848f2075f881559bca08fd174aa	No, it will not be legal.  You will be required to bring proof that you are divorced.  If you go ahead and get married anyway, maybe they won't ask you or you lie and say you are not married, Islamically your marriage will not be legal.  You are not allowed to be married to 2 men at the same time.  You should first get an annulment from the Phillipines, then marry him legally.  If he is from UAE and later they find out you are married, you can be in big trouble with the law, get deported or put in jail.  If you love him and he loves you, do things the right way from the beginning.    Actually, even if you converted to Islam, you are still married in the Phillipines, a marriage is a marriage, no matter what religion you were when you got married and a muslim woman can't be married to two men at the same time.  If it were your bf that was married and not you, that would be a different story as men can have up to 4 wives.  Why do you want to start a marriage knowing you are still legally married to someone else?  Get the annulment, then start your life the right way, without anything that could cause problems later.|`|03d01a6103efa8301758a6dccfe8de92aa	Just read this link maybe it will help    www.sunnipath.com/resources/Questions/...   www.sunnipath.com/resources/Questions/...    God bless!|`|9bb57c6a8d87323b1aa944b3db0b6798aa	No it will not be legal in UAE, your first marriage in Philippines is still valid unless you get anullment first or another choice would be convert yourself to Muslim and go for the marriage but you have to learn to adjust so many things.  Your first marriage will be void (if it is Christian marriage) when you convert to Muslim as per Sharia law (right UmmFaissal)?  Think it over, this is serious matter.

So di qualcuno che taglia i ponti con una e-mail o con una SMS.  E' terribilmente difficile dire ad una persona non ti amo pi.  Vedere il suo viso cambiare improvvisamente impressione, impallidire.  Sono le prove difficili della vita. Momenti che  si verrebbe non giungessero mai, ma che dobbiamo affrontare per rispetto verso quella persona che era stato tutto il nostro mondo, che avevamo amata e che ancora ci ama.  Ed  inutile girare intorno. L' abbandono rimane in tutta la sua drammaticit. Ed evitiamo anche quel triste contentino del "restiamo amici". L' amicizia, dopo l' amore,  un insulto.  Quindi far violenza a se stessi, prendere l' ultimo appuntamento e subito, prima che manchi il coraggio, ferire a morte una persona alla quale vogliamo ancora bene.   Anche questa  la vita.|`|eb4e6e1af78198f86221d94f4e7a6c9aaa	- per vigliaccheria  - si vuole evitare di vedere la sofferenza negli occhi dell'altro quando gli si vuole ancora bene, ma il rapporto non pu continuare.|`|43eedcd34c42b7ac39c8c124409ec3b6aa	Penso che non sia obbligatorio essere forti.

Certo sarebbe pi giusto dire le cose guardando una persona negli occhi, ma se uno non ce la fa non puoi mica ammazzarlo!    Perch devo fare per forza una cosa che non sento di fare o che non ho il coraggio di fare? L'importante  essere coerenti e ammettere di non essere degli eroi, e assumersi la responsabilit di non essere stati politically correct...    Tutte le mie amiche che sono state mollate per telefono ne fanno una tragedia... ma cosa ti cambia in fondo essere mollata mentrer ti guarda negli occhi? Non ti sta forse mollando comunque? Forse guardandoti negli occhi non sarebbe riuscito a mollarti, e telefonare era l'unico modo per riuscire a fare ci che voleva!

AA11128712	Do you mean BDSM?  It stands for Bondage, Domination and Sado-Masochism, and it covers a whole range of erotic activities from simple spanking to shackles, whips, chains and knifeplay.     Unless you know what you're doing, best to stay clear of the more extreme stuff until you meet someone who can guide you through it.  But if all you're interested in is a little consensual spanking and some light bondage (handcuffs, etc), it shouldn't be too difficult to find a partner to play with.

It's not worth totally falling for someone who isn't available.  It just causes a lot of anger, and can lead to low self esteem, especially if you start to wonder why he doesn't want to be with you instead of her.  It's hard to try and forget someone if you've liked them for a while, but if he's with someone else at the moment, then it wasn't meant to be.  I'd try to look for someone else.  That's how I found my boyfriend.  I gave up on the last guy I liked for 8 months and got together with my boyfriend.  And I've never been happier.  Believe me, it's better to move on.  And if things don't work out between the two of them in the future, you can always look forward to a chance with him.  But have fun until then by hanging out with someone who is available!

If you do end up having the chance to get to know him and all and he likes u and u like him more then thats great.

People who don't know themselves very well would do something like the above scenario. She might be embarrassed, insecure, unsure, and/or in denial. Another thing, just because she "flirts" with you does not mean she wants a relationship with you. What types of signs tell you she likes you? I would not take any sign, but her word face-to-face with you. Misunderstandings happen when one person "misreads" signs from another person due to people's different perceptions of a situation.|`|de92507a35e7aed9dac18dd975ffb51eaa	The reason she told your friends she didn't like you is because she's shy.

She wanted to cover her tracks and make sure that any over-friendliness she may have exhibited to you won't possess you to ask her out. Sorry babe, but move past and look elsewhere. Unfortunately, as women we sometimes get carried away doing what we consider being sweet but men consider flirting. But even as an attractive woman, you would see me speak to a fat ugly man the same as I speak to average joe. I may bat my eyes and smile a little too sexy but it's all in good fun. Enjoy the attention then forget it.

Women need emotional stimulation.    Even men who don't look at porn, still fantasize about women that they meet or see in passing.  By him looking at porn it is less personal.    A man could have a hundred women and still fantasize about the one he doesn't have.  It is a natural instinct and there is nothing wrong with it.|`|f0d7d9225b27aec6d9241ac1c9dbc82caa	If you don't like it then get a boyfriend that doesn't watch it.  I don't see anything wrong with it.
AA11112923	How would you feel if you were the one having the 15 year relationship and another girl came into the picture?  Because I hate to say this, but if you keep on and he does leave her, you will more than likely find out in a few years.    How could you hurt children?  Did you know he was in this relationship of 15 years when this all started?    You deserve to be honest with yourself.  You, as a person, deserve more that this.  You need a man that will only wants you.      As far as your child you two have together now, I would let him be a part of his/her life, but that would be as far as it goes.      Why would you want to be with someone that has already cheated on someone else.  You can't change him.  He isn't going to stop, unless he really wants to, and you or no one else can change him.|`|aa7952b98dee1fe421d09f4e27b2f058aa	You sure have messed up several lives.

I married my wife because she wanted to give me what she would never give any other man before. That was the best present i have ever been given in my whole life. You can give nothing better, than what you have saved for the right eon. Don't you dare give him anything short of all you have. You give him everything that a woman could and he will love you for it. Make sure he knows he is the first and the last. Do not give all, all the time. Men like to hunt, give them all, but make them suffer, the more they suffer for their supper, the more they feel special.

AA11128712	From what I know of the spanking scene - and we're talking adult erotic spanking here, not child punishment, right? - I'd say it's more common for girls to get spanked than guys, by a ratio of around 75:25.    Why?  Well, it may be partly psychological:  women on the whole (though of course not universally) love to feel protected and cared for, and spanking is a good sexy way of acting this out.  Also it's physical - girls' bottoms are generally softer, plumper and more rounded than mens', and just seem to invite spanking.|`|24192022f825521f9d18e989a1c643fbaa	Girls.

From what I've gathered, it seems that things like who earns the most money are irrelevant - what matters is the trust and mutual regard between you.  It may take a little while, but I think you'll find that, as the pattern of the relationship between you becomes established, he'll find it easier to take the dominant role in money matters as well as in all the other areas where you want to defer to him.  The more you show him how happy it makes you to submit - not just when you're across his knee, though of course that's a vital part of it - the more readily he'll be able to assume his role as HOH.|`|7b4c823489e696ce3ad8322999def908aa	follow ur heart and allow him to be  u are great for each other      by the way ty for answering my questions about places where u will like to have sex at    email me peterfl999@yahoo.com to share ideas

Women that are too loaded on themselves do not have the capacity to share anything in a meaningful manner.  Ultimately everything revolves around them and I cannot stand those types of orbits.    Unfortunately I work for and with many people of this variety.  I tolerate them only because I like money.    I feel that women whom can give freely of themselves are much more attractive.|`|6cf0f1e4d885e0694bb39f5d48d7fd70aa	they start to get annoying after a while

AA11128712	Doesn't sound like this guy had much of a clue about spanking.  First off he should have checked out whether you're into it, or at least curious enough to give it a try.  Then he certainly shouldn't have handcuffed you the first time - that comes much later, if at all.  And he should have started out quite gently and gradually spanked harder, to see how you were reacting - and given you a safeword to use if it was getting more than you could take.  That way you might well have found it fun, and wanted to try it again.    Incompetent, insensitive idiots like him give us kinky folk a bad name....|`|69a5ece8f0ebd5c71b968c1e946fcde1aa	If he was spanking you and he refused to stop when you told him to stop, then that constitiutes assault and battery, a felony. While the compromised position may be embarassing, you should report this to the police, the sooner the better. The police are probably going to treat your situation professionally as the situation that you were in is not unique.    If you are wanting to press charges do so before any bruises from the impact disappear. The police will want to take photos as evidence, but it would be done by either a female officer or a doctor. Remember, you are a victim here, and you have every right to seek prosecution.|`|cd5e8f01d94c46dde6d91c21674c506faa	try the police, they might have heard this too many times to laugh about it|`|0eb8e2529a831dc82799f42047942b54aa	No woman should ever prefer the "R" word...

58d2aadcc08ee2184b1dc5f594119f48aa	You are jealous, own that.The first thing u said is you understand your sister needs help.  Then u said she is selfish, rude and aggressive.  If u knew anything about mental illness --and this disorder--u would know that she has mood swings all the time.  She can't help it.  I don't know if she is on meds 4 it or not, or if she is in therapy.  What I do know just by your statement, you hate what she puts your family through.  You probably consider yourself "the good kid".  You are mad at ur friend for caring about ur sister more than u do.  You feel she should side with u about ur sisters' actions.  Sometimes friends come in our lives to bring light on a situation that we try 2 hide.  Don't be mad with ur friend.  U need to thank her for caring.  What u need 2 do is educate yourself about this disorder.  The more u know--the more u will grow closer to your sister.  Trust me.There is nothing more special than a sisters love.  That is the ultimate girlfriend.No matter what u do she will never judge u, stab u in ur back.talk about you, will always be there 4u.  If she is in therapy --the net time she has an appointment--go with her for support.  She would love that.  And maybe ur best friend Can be ur sisters best friend 2.|`|AA11112923	I would feel lucky to have found a friend that cared about my family enough to want to help.    I know you feel like you are being left out.  Maybe she is looking at your life, and how your sisters disease effects you, and is just wanting to help.    Don't be to hasty to push her out of your life.  She may end up being one of the best people in your life.
eb0fa92b4a344d205e7cf5516af4179daa	That's a tough one.  In the end this is only my opinion and from the perspective of an outsider to this relationship and you will have to make the decision...but perhaps I can give you a few things to consider.  1.  Are you happy in the relationship aside from these questions of honesty?  2.  Are you really bothered by the things that she's hidden from you?  3.  Do you feel that after two years she should trust you more? (I do.)  Once again, what I view to be the most important, are you happy?  And don't forget to be totally honest with yourself.  I could understand that you care greatly for this girl, but ultimately she's not your responsibility.  You shouldn't stay in a relationship out of guilt.  You won't be abandoning her, you'll actually be doing the right thing for the both of you if your not happy.  You'll be true to yourself, which is paramount, and trusting her to move on and handle her emotions herself.  I've been with my guy for a little over a year now, and we've been through a whole lot together.  Stuff like a mother passing away and the other's mother going more or less crazy, family and business troubles, etc.  I've leaned on him a lot and he was always there for me and vice a versa.  Now we're mellowing out, leaning on each other less and I'm learning how to be by myself again.  You can't be someone else's confidence or reason.  You can be supportive and offer advice but that's about it.  What I'm trying to say in a long winded manner is that what I feel it comes down to is whether or not you are happy and feel that you are in a healthy relationship that's worth your while.  Like I said this is a tough one, I wish you the best of luck and peace of mind.  Sage|`|AA10100609	Go out with another girl. Because she is out out with other guys.|`|AA11556349	Lose her, Bubba.

She sounds like a liar.  Nobody keeps a phone for self esteem issues.  She is not over her ex--I am sorry to say, or at least she wasn't.  I am curious if yours is a rebound relationship?    Though it doesn't seem like you have a big age difference you do.  People do the most changing between the ages of 18-22-plain and simply.  Not to mention your relationship is long distance?  I think you need to reevaluate what it is you love about her...reason being, if you let her go and she truly loves you she will come back to you...but space will not help.  It may be wise to take a small break for a while and let her "explore" on her own.|`|d7ba3a16a8b3828e7a827a146250a953aa	I would let her go. Speaking from experience more than likely she is seeing someone else.|`|b81a3bd1ab0e0a44bcb4b126ec6b6e57aa	Obviously trust is a MAJOR issue in this relationship.  Why is it a problem for her to walk with her friends?  Are you too possessive or jealous?  Why does she feel the need to lie to you?  Lastly, if she is using another mobile number to see if her ex wants to keep in touch with her then it sounds as if she's not over him or is unsure that she wants it over.  If she has low self esteem then she needs to seek counseling.  That is not for you to fix.  You both are very young.  If you have trust issues now, how will you move forward with this relationship?  By the way, I'm a Licensed Counselor.|`|a3c8cd4c001e0df1907a8fc54f76a93aaa	You're not "together".  You're too far apart, and it is pretty clear she has other interests on the side.    You need to look for a relationship with somebody you can have a full time relationship with.  So the answer is "leave her".    I'm not too keen on you checking up on her like you have been doing.  If it happened that you accidentally found out, that is one thing, but if you have been spending much time finding out if she is really where she says she is, then you have a problem with overcontrol and it will cost you relationships in the future.    g'luck|`|AA11112923	Well, the part about her father should not effect the relationship.    The part about you catching her in lies would bother me.  You have to have complete trust in a relationship.  Especially when you live in different places.   If you can't trust her, then the relationship will never work.  Just because she has fessed up with the lies you have caught her in, what makes you think she don't have some lies you haven't caught her in, and isn't telling you the truth.    Trust, communication, and love are the foundations of a good relationship.    I would sit down and talk to her.  Tell her that you are having questions about the relationship as far as trust goes.  Go from there.  If you still feel you can't trust her, then break it off.    Good luck!!!

6c6f1ad547419c0dbe3dc3921a5dd814aa	Maybe you think he is your best bud but it doesnt sound like you are his best bud. Dont skip classes for him or anyone else. Dont give up anything for him. If he values you as a bud he will stop letting you down. Sometimes if you play hard to get, poeople want you more. You can do better. Find a better friend.|`|78709f9aaddc3399e31540af8043e0c3aa	Find a new friend.|`|AA11313402	Yes definetly.

You deserve a better friend.|`|AA11119626	I don't know if it's time to ditch the guy. You never know how things will turn out over time. Relationships never stay the same, and sometimes one person or the other will develop new interests, or meet new people, and focus on that, or them, for a while. This time, he's the one exploring new things. Next time, it will probably be you. If you want to be friends for the long haul, let him have this time to try new things, and just be glad to see him whenever you do.    Meantime, it's time for you to do some exploring on your own. Somewhere out there are other people who will like you. What are you interested in? What do you like to do? If, for example, you like to skateboard, try the skateboard parks. Go where people are doing the things you like to do, and you'll meet people you have something in common with - and it won't matter so much to you what this other guy is doing, because you'll be so busy with your own life.|`|AA10053890	yes|`|fdfb388d891825df00cdfada9a3297f1aa	i would - b/c it seems he isnt tell you something - and if he really is your true firend he would acknowledge your feelings and try to fix it|`|86b5585612645a97b6d28eccc31a47eeaa	just give him some time to do his own thing,he will come around.|`|0b843a6f00276cbc8b3183bbc05ead1baa	how old r yall??    he might be hanging out w/ a gurl    u sound young|`|0ea659de45cbe0b0d6787838f4e69a5caa	I'm having the same problem as you but my reasons are slightly different from you...I haven't told her anything!

AA11989533	It's human nature and likewise sometimes the pursiut is more enticing then the catch. It is important to establish a relationship built on honsety and communication where you can see the whole picture before deciding one way or another. Sometimes you may not see something in someone until they are with someone else because either that person brings it out in them or simply recognizes it and it becomes clear to others as well.|`|835710ea621b50c5e72941f80061417eaa	Sorry to say it but you are suffering from typical jealousy.

AA11128712	Do you mean: when a guy tells a girl that she needs to be spanked?  Or that he does?   Well, either way it's definitely an erotic proposal, no question.

859a48d7c9291388d9bb554c5605751faa	Hahaha...  Well, it's pretty crazy actually.  We met because he used to live in the apartment above my ex-boyfriend.  No, I didn't leave my ex for him.  I left my ex because my ex deserved to be left.  Then I dated (for less than two weeks) my ex-boyfriend's cousin, who happened to live with my now-boyfriend at the time.    But then I got with my current boyfriend and we've been together for almost a year.  He no longer lives in that apartment building or with either of my ex's.  They were all friends but in a very vague sort of way.  They were more like acquaintances than actual friends.

He's been lying to you and who knows what else.  Maybe the next time he calls, you can have your family say you aren't there and give him a taste of his own medicine for once. Make yourself as unavailable as he's been. I know it would be hard, very very hard, but maybe by showing him that you aren't just waiting around for his calls could be what it takes to get him back on track.

I just wanted to get married, I wanted my dream but I also knew there was a reality of money. So, I got my princess look and we had a big party wedding but we cut budget with decorations. It was beautiful. Also when I met him there was things we decided together we wanted to add like we decided we wanted the congregation to be a part of our wedding so we had them say a little part of commitment after our personal vows. Our colors were blue and purple. My maid of honor wore a dark blue dress and the other bridesmaids wore sky blue dresses. My maid of honor sang during our unity candles and then as a surprise to use during our ceremony our pastor said some really nice things about us. It was really sweet. We ended up only having a 20 minute ceremony which was good because I was hot and I felt like passing out!!!|`|AA10727113	Dream wedding ... hummm thats an interesting one to think of.

The cermony would be small but memoriable.  And we would write our own vows.  And during the ring exchange he would put a necklace around each of the three kid's necks.

And memories could flood into the heart at any given time.|`|f304f8482be918c46d08f218591e536baa	maybe a card that says sory for your loss? my boyfriends mom is passed away and it is also hard to know what to do.|`|498b50c5e53f6e7b8a9b263a290e4ebdaa	Say a prayer with his family on the anniversary.  Everybody there could talk about the family member that has passed.  Just remember him.|`|5cf0470a204de934eb842ceee9cb69cfaa	Are you close to his mom and family? if so you can have a potluck, every one bring a dish. and you can just be together. early in the day, you can visit his grave and go to you house, and eat and talk, or you could make a scrap book with all of his brothers pictures in it. that is very healing also. or you can just get him a nice card, thinking of you. I think just the though of you remembering, and want to do something means more to him, then you will ever know.|`|AA12057390	Your boyfriend could have family over for dinner serving his deceased brother's favorite foods, beverages, deserts People could bring pictures of them together and talk about all the wonderful ways they remember him.|`|AA10715286	I lost my brother and I would prefer if noone gave me something or threw me an anniversary dinner or anything like that.  I wouldn't know how I would feel that day and I wouldn't want anyone to remind me in those ways.  Maybe just ask how he's doing or just hang with him more that day.  Don't make a big deal about it.|`|30718357812ae864c64fd8170981936daa	write him a poem or anything and read it to his grave|`|69301f6b672d23aeb5b91eae5fc9c61baa	How about you two take a visit to his grave site on a nice afternoon and take some flowers and just hold his hand!|`|22d319f838284b12be8b9889fc8c0257aa	is your boyfriend family having a memorial or something? if so just be there with him. and if you knew his brother well find a nice poem to read at the memorial you can even make a special; dish i dont see any of that out of the way.

You have the potential for a long term friendship with your gf.  Chances are you won't remember the boy five years from now.

Are you sure about what you're thinking? Is it true that he likes you than her? If it's true, you have an advantage. He likes you. Give him and your best friend more time. She will know that it's better for her not to break the good relationship between you and her. Good luck. I don't believe in the boy you love.|`|9145175c5ded979dc0909d69291a55e5aa	turn your attention away from them both, and see what develops.  you might be surprised|`|900d096b5c692d8570640ac6428ed092aa	i don't know but you should just ask him for the truth.|`|9332051206eab5fd5c156d670de5c839aa	I am going to take an aspirin and don't call me in the morning.  My head probably won't be done spinning from this one for a week.|`|9c697081aa93857177ff33c8794d51a9aa	your girl friend may say she is ok with you wanting him but all women are competitive when it comes to a man.  when you are around she is trying to show you up, maybe not intentionally but she is.  go get what you want girl!  if he likes you he wont fool with her.|`|3e62d5eba18f7072db55d98298169717aa	ummmm...  u'd better tell him that u like him..  and when he's attracted to u..  it'll be a gr8 positive step to win this guy..|`|AA11394308	well i think this girl is a bit of a trouble monger. but the important thing is wat do yu want. is this guy like the one guy for you. are you ready to jeapordise a relation with yur girlfriend to get this guy. if the ans is yes then talk to this guy in private. go out with him. also use his male friends for more details.  but if yu are closer to yur girl buddy then talk to her heart to heart and explain yur position by something like" i kno yu have feelings for this guy" that shud open her and we will get to know.  dont try the cheating method. you will never get good friend if it gets out in the open.  hope everything works out good for you.|`|423a6476edb789059d4488afd68df9feaa	i think you should talk to him and your friend ... seperatly  and see whats going on    good luck  srry if i didnt help

Get over it and stop making excuses you can't expect to always receive and never give.|`|AA10812231	In a marriage, you shouldn't have to worry about STD's.    Why would anyone want to engage in any sexual activities with someone that they suspect may have an STD???  That's disgusting!!  You need to set some standards!  You're too easy!      I strongly disagree with your statement.|`|502cbfb4c7c6587e4430ed414242f93caa	u can still get a lot of STD's by having a dirty mouth giving you a bj. if she has something that she got from some other guys penis then she can still give it to you off her mouth...and might even think its just a cold soar in her mouth??? there vaginal condoms called  dental dams for safer oral sex on a women. and women can always give a bj with a guy wearing a condom too.
13c55ecae3672f1a7425b409bcb9da73aa	I don't have a preference on anything, height, color etc. I am 6 2 1/2 and it would be nice to give a real hug without bending over all the time.|`|20227535a83ddc015146618cbc93ecd5aa	Actually I'm not picky. As long as the woman treats me properly I'm happy.|`|6373b9cd46b6bcd2e6f18e3d6a5d41d0aa	not my cup of tea.  I'm a tall guy (6'4), and for some reason I'm attracted to smaller women.  I think it has more to do with their types of personalities.... there is a difference between tall gals and shorter gals.    Good Luck tho|`|aa321d35b99559138b9a1e5909826e12aa	Better question, women, do you like tall women?

e04f920ac8671312d2adf90e742f3c7caa	Been there, DONE that. More than likely, they are avoiding you. Best to just ask. Don't pursue too long, however, or it might be misconstrued as stalking...lol|`|b142ea26a9c257d7ccac185e3a907b73aa	avoid them back!|`|eb5fc0dee21a8fbd37b7e93e58b2d65daa	well if ur a guy, then thats what girls do if they are not interested, if ur a girl then ur probably quite ugly|`|fe3863fd67cf75804445448637f44f65aa	Move on!

93b53c5ba37275697d1cbc9be5932cd1aa	The hotter a girl is, the more readily most guys assume she's a slut. Also, the amount of confidence you show plays a role. You should not let that stop you though. You should be confident for yourself.    Good looking girls will attract all sorts of guys (I guess 'all guys' is a better expression :P ) But as long as you are also gentle and kind towards others, you will attract the right guys. Your task is then to say no to all the idiots and find the nice guy you like and ask him out.    Good luck. And don't let an a$$hole pressure you into anything. You are a confident girl and you should stay that way.|`|AA12340410	first of all, i don't judge by looks. personality is the entire thing, the relationship is more important than casaba melons.|`|8b6f0d9235bbb81440a13a840b64ea4faa	Well it is a funny thing, because everyone thinks they can make good judgements by looks, but first impressions are usually always wrong. It is difficult to know what kind of impression someone might get without being able to see you. Maybe they are just surprised because most attractive girls give in to sex and it is rare to find someone who hasn't. Maybe you are attracting guys who just want you for sex and are disappointed when they discover you may not be ready to give it to them. If you want to send me a pic I will give you an honest opinion of what my first impression might be (though it will be hard not to be biased based on the information you have given).    ineedalotofyou@hotmail.com|`|AA11714935	I prefer to not judge at all. Looks get my attention,sure, but what's on the inside is what I find appealing. Nice personality, intelligence, good sense of humor, that sort of thing. If you possess those qualities, and these little horn-dogs don't recognize it, then figure you're well off for ignoring them. Their loss. Not to worry, some day you will meet the right guy. You'll know when it happens.|`|ef30fec0b0ab6137ae55109cc2c25ccfaa	They don't believe you? Don't bother.  Your right guy WILL come. I personally believe that virginity will be your best gift to that right one.  In the meantime, hold on til the right one comes along.|`|817dcdce9521c8d5233b0e0f8dbf8503aa	I try not to :) but it`s hard|`|d5880549f430ad6bada9c98bed624dcdaa	Big tit's, small a**|`|4c496d16598b2db6c615d4ede63abd85aa	well as a female I can tell you that yes alot of men do in fact judge a girl by her looks. Happens to me every stinking day of my life.  Unfortunately for me I am one ugly woman. Hey atleast Im honest.|`|b142ea26a9c257d7ccac185e3a907b73aa	if she dresses like a freak.. we say FREAK!  if you dress with your clothes tight we will think you are sexy and that you want us to say that and youre looking for a sex buddy! if you dress like a lady we will treat you like one.|`|165f279b106e91b84a1d7157462ae58aaa	hey.  i have somewhat the same problem. guys say im hot. and most of them want sex. and then they leave me when they dont get it. i think its the guy(some of them!). i dont know, and i dont want to say nething wrong. so i wont say much. but they look at you as what you look like(again, some of them) but others go for what you look like and what goes with your looks like your attitude. idk, . like they say, what you see isnt always what u get.|`|eb5fc0dee21a8fbd37b7e93e58b2d65daa	lol, i love giving advice to sad girls! dear oh dear missy! First of all dressing in short skirts too often makes boys think ur slutty, u should wear trousers or long skirt 9 out of ten times. Second putting fake tan on makes u look really cheap and slutty. Thirdly it may be ur personality. If u are very open about ur sexuality, always saying how nice brad pitt is etc, then thats also a real turn off and makes u seem slutty. Most girls dont have very strong sex drives and if they do they dont admit it.  In short if u want blokes to respect u then act like a lady not a tramp!
46b32fde311283ba1fd90bb6459163cbaa	You're moving a little fast there aren't ya?? You haven't even kissed her yet and you're already planning sex?? No wonder STDs are spreading like crazy and there are single mothers all over the place. How do you know she hasn't been with an "uncut" man?? Maybe when you were having the conversation where she told you this you could have said "oh hey, by the way, I'm uncircumcised."  Who cares?? Just be sure to wear a condom. Be safe, and be responsible.|`|0eed9c0d5321fb5386d80251ae138fb0aa	Ok so you are fully equipped like a Latin lover, just make sure you are clean "under the hood" (and everywhere else too), no problem. If you and she should develop a relationship and she gets to know you as a decent, caring, compassionate and clean man, when the time comes to introduce her to your little friend she will see it as part of that man, and grow to love it as part of you.     Any guy that doesn't keep it clean probably has stinky pits and crack too!|`|308c086a1d418fda936a884631ba4361aa	If she cares about you for who you are it will not matter|`|AA11690464	Now how the hell would you know sex is more enjoyable.  Did you have it cut off, and added back on?|`|5db1ecdba3d6ae84acaaa775a2f8b44daa	You don't know that she hasn't seen an uncircumcised one, she might have.    Don't feel bad if she wants to look though- it does look way different than when it's circumcised. Curiosity.|`|91b6d988ce73301bb77def26adde5e48aa	if things get that far i can't see you stopping to tell her.  you plan things in advance.  i would bet you even know what you are going to say and do when you see her to lead up to the kiss.  i advocate open communication.  if she objects to having sex with someone that is not circumcised you need to know before it goes that far.  talk about an uncomfortable moment.  i say you should tell her.  and if you have never been cut, how do you know that sex is more enjoyable for you.  don't be smug young man.|`|f0d9913ce405e7a9de76fe44dcf46013aa	most guys should think you are lucky. because you will be a lot more sensitive in that area. She shouldn't care and don't tell her. I mean that might come across as the fact that you have a problem with it. If you guys do hook up and she sees and makes a comment just explain it.|`|AA11843681	you have to feel ok about it for your self not to feel uncomfortable and as for ANY girl she needs to like you for you not dislike you for something as stupid as that.You can still go and have a circumcision done it just cost a little bit. Talk to your family doctor.

61380560f287444cf3d858b7e555eb30aa	hey~i don't know how old you are or what grade you are in, but that doesn't really matter now does it?    pretty much all through out the years that you will be in school you are going to run up against those bullys (that truly feel REALLY small inside and that is why they pick on you) and it doesn't matter what you do, because they won't stop no matter what you do.     you need to be strong and remind yourself that you are too good for the likes of them, if you were like them, you'd be messing with somebody, right? but you aren't.     it really is about shifting the "focus" off of them, because if they didn't, then people would be noticing their weaknesses, shortcomings and flaws. but they are so worried about that that they find someone else to use as a diversion.    this happened to me all throughout jr. high school~this one girl picked on me incessantly, and then she had a few friends that joined in and made my life pure misery for three years.     i finally did the wrong thing and i beat her up.     well i got time in an institution for that, but nobody would do anything to her before i snapped, and after i did well, that made HER the victim, even though by all her picking and picking she had forced me to show my hand.     that is really NOT the way to go about it.    nowadays they have stricter rules about bullying and harrassment. i know~nobody wants to go that route, but IF it DOES get to be too much, don't be afraid to report them.    but  you can get through it with your head up, and your self esteem still in tact, you can~i know you can.     you will get to them alot more by not buying into their game (and that is really all it is to them is a game). prove to them that you are the stronger person (and you are).     like i said before~if you were like them, you too would be making somebody elses day a bust.     i wish i had some better answer than that, but there really is no cure for the punks in school that have to boost themselves up by trying to push someone else down.    good luck~and show them what you are made of by not letting them get to you~    ~SMILE IN THEIR FACE!! (but not so as to make them mad)|`|93b408d30503546dc522d9bf8e6cc92caa	put out|`|f09d8614877bb3026049edeccd213c23aa	being popular isnt always a good thing, just try to find some friends that care about you for who you are and dont try to hard to impress anyone but yourself|`|bc12ad9b26707e8dccb03307164571c6aa	particaipate more, ask lots of questions, try to be funny and friendly, stand up for ur self and dont let them get to you|`|AA10214302	popular: a few definitions  1. liked by all and have many friends  2. everyone is scared of them and obeys their every command in order to keep their life.  3. everyone looks up to them because they are a role model!   you choose which one you want! but once you have it dont switch! its too much trouble!|`|b65e1dd73c03b98fceddbb5759c5a756aa	dracula??i like vamps guess u do listen if u look diff people will always attack those who are,find away go to class's i mean boxing,martial arts not to beat on them but to respect who u are and again protect urself at the end of the day you  are everyone needs to find them selfs maybe its ur turn.
AA12244965	Um, if you guys were that compatible, I think you'd be together still and you wouldn't have trouble beleiving he loves you. He's more likely keeping the contact out of familiar memories and desires he had w/ you. My ex does the same thing until he's with a new girl. And when she's gone, he comes right back to me. But, I'm well aware of why he is this way and that it's NOT love (and he doesnt' claim it, so I know neither of us are in love anymore) but if he ever did think I was right for him, I'm sure he'd prove it and I'd actually believe it. If you don't believe it, then it's probably not real.|`|addea2dbe75dae5c632bc50588c93d93aa	OK this is what I think.Get a new man and then your ex will wont you so bad but if he dose not wont you then he did not love you and by then maybe you will love the new man.That is what I did and my ex wonted me back and by then I loved the new man and it is the best thing I have none.
28d560e4900d8dbca7ef761455dca6dbaa	Why stop?  The relationship may be over.  You come to terms with it so you can move on.  But you can love at a distance.  To the point of surrender.  Resolve to be kind to yourself.  You cant deal with anothers problems. Only your own.  Are you with me.  My ex was an addict.  Extremely painful lifestyle.  Gone on drug binges every 10 minutes.  Thats why he is my ex.   You get tired of the emotional roller coaster, obsessing, hurting, wondering.   Self torture,  Trust in God.  Trust yourself to give it over.  Time is a wonderful thing.  It works.  I hope I have helped you to find your path.|`|AA10383578	good luck!!!|`|41f2f822ffa087f77c7b13a239c13760aa	when they go out change the locks and frow his clothes out of the window.....lol|`|AA10220429	You have to give up on the dream of what you thought you were going to have or did have.

Now and days that school started, he looks at me from time to time at lunch time. =]    The good thing to do is propably just to introduce yourself to him, if you don't know him....if you already do...just try to find out who he likes. Sometimes letters can be blah...but half the time they work. ^^;; hang out with him a lot...and tell him you like him. Because you'll never know....someone might tell him that they like him.|`|9de3d56ff2a776219ca361e295d4d46baa	Try to get know him and put a love note in his locker.That'll do the trick.|`|997925102299df6ddfd2ecae5334d1bcaa	you shouldn't place letters in his locker.

If he likes what he sees, he'll come to you!|`|3abdd48faae2c8d6b5056ede8dae4c2daa	if he asks you out, that means he likes you.
1c124fd5416d3a299c6b705db146a024aa	You guys are so young.  Im 26 and I've finally experienced true intimacy.  this sounds gross, but I never thgout i could fart in front of a guy, and it took about a year and a half with my current boyfriend but now we are like fart machines, lol.  What you are looking for is intimacy and it's hard to acheieve, you have to be patient.  Just keep sticking by each others side and spending time together and it will come to you.  The best thing to do is talk about this wall that seems to be there, and that can open the door to that intimacy.  Communication is totally key, I've learned that the hard way!|`|AA11513482	When your shy it's hard to talk so how about listen to each other.  Get to know someting  about each other.|`|AA10260180	u need to spend more time alone in order for the relationship to advance, you thought you where spending time together learning about each other but you wheren't until you where truly alone together|`|AA11584742	Take things naturally, don't push it 2 fast or don't try to make it go to slow. Follow ur heart  I was in a realtionship with someone I loved dearly, everyday he told me he loved me. I felt I was jsut scared because of the fear of rejection startin back with my parents. I never realy had the chance to love this man as much as I wanted to.  5 months into the relaitonship I finally tell him I loved Him tho I felt it all along. The next day I get a call saying he has been murdered.  What does this tell u?  Cheris the moment, u never know when it will be ur last.  Just read my other question  about how I am filled with regret cuz I tried to force this love to slow down. I wish I never had done that.  Just take it natural. DON'T TRY TO SPEED IT UP    Enjoy each other ur both young crack a couple of jokes once in a while, be the comic relief(u both seem up tight 2 me), make him laugh. He''l come around. Trust me all the little things u think u enjoyhe will to. You are just as human as he is.LIGHTEN UP!  I wish u lots of happiness in ur young love.....

Secondly, people are going to tell you it will be alright give it time, and in time it will pass, but to get to that point you are going to have to suffer, but there is always the possibility that it'll work out in the end.|`|34b42349a1e9daf8ca942057c78194c7aa	Give it time. You'll be able to move on.|`|AA12244965	Honestly, shet happens, but life goes on. I know it's not easy right NOW, but it will be in time. Maybe you should just be there as a friend for her, which she desperately needs at this time, and quit w/ the hindering of that selfish thought that you won't see her as much as you use to. You guys COULD get back together in the future, but maybe not. Whatever happens, I'm sure you'll be fine.

AA10493015	napping is very healthy.  It provide you with more energy and mental awareness, as well as, lowering blood pressure and heart rate.      My all time hero for proper living, was my ex-gf/fiance's father in Italy.    started work at 8:30; He came home at 11:30, ate lunch that was freshly prepared for his arrival; at 12:00 noon, he retired to the bedroom with his wife, had sex, and then slept for 2 hours;      3:00 pm; went back to work until 8 -10 depending.  Had dinner; played tennis, socialized, whatever.  1:00 am went to bed.    He was/is a very happy, successful, healthy man.|`|AA11603230	He's tired. Duh.

AA11543024	Well if he didn't like it then why would you want to like a guy who doesn't have the same sense of humor as you?    How about asking him if he liked it?  Pretty simple.    I'm sure he liked it but was maybe a little embarassed about getting a Birthday Card from some hot girl?    :)|`|AA10555226	ask one of ur friends to ask him if he hates u|`|AA10209365	well... did he wear the button? that would tell you if he liked it or now|`|AA10461566	I don't get it. Was ityour Bday or his? Maybe if it was his he might have thought about it that you were just making fun of him, but maybe if he has an open mind he might have intreperated the other way. He might just have been embarresed and left without saying something. Look at him tomorrow and if he blushes when you look at him or talk ti him then you got him. Good luck.!!|`|9a40a330be2c9d69f628cb2dbc458128aa	well i also think it's cute. did he thank you for the card? if not, then he might not like it or he is just really ungrateful. but you have to realize that not everybody will like what you do or what you like. not everybody is ok to those sort of jokes.    try asking him if he liked it. it's ok to do that. then just explain to him that you mean no malice when you gave it.|`|AA11128712	Sounds cute and flirty in a nice way.  If he takes it wrong, he's maybe not the guy for you.  Of course, he might decide you're the one who wants spanking - but that could be fun too....|`|AA10625778	Stop driving yourself crazy...

AA11119479	If you go to a strip club, you can get a lap dance for an extra charge. Usually, this is when an exotic dancer grinds on your lap for a few minutes in an attempt to sexually arouse you, but remember, in most clubs, you're not allowed to touch her.|`|09a6cb26e6638faba415911ae15d3945aa	a lap dance is...if u were a boy and u have a girl friend and it was ur B-day,she will go up to u and dance to u really close.|`|1eafc7d2745d873056abda89fd644203aa	it's not really dancing...  the "dancer" rubs her crotch and butt on the  man's groin area while shoving her breasts in his face..|`|3ba136f81de678dcc8523f842ea96856aa	another word for, can I have a tip, if you're a bartender|`|45bb82194703e5b442ab4f851928e064aa	For $10-20 and up a stripper will "dance" in your lap for a song or two while you sit on a couch.

If so then who is going to financially responsible and support that baby?  Obviously if he has another girlfriend you were just being used for sex and now you've learned the consequences...|`|AA11021217	why did you do it in the first place.  you have to think about the child and whether your going to keep it because the child will be the biggest impacted not you, yes it is devestating to get rid of your own child but think about this the child will ask one day who its daddy is and you need to think about what your going to say and the fathers familiy may reject the child which will further impact on the child. you also need to think about wat if the child asks you why there parents arent together. think about how you would feel if you were told that you were the result of a one night stand,|`|78709f9aaddc3399e31540af8043e0c3aa	That sounds like a cop out to me.

So how about getting your story straight, ok?|`|58d2aadcc08ee2184b1dc5f594119f48aa	You are not hitting yourself harder than your mother. That's  1.    When moms hit, they bring the lightning, thunder and rain.  All at 1 time.  That is why you cry when your mom tear that butt up.  You don't have enough force behind whatever your using 2 hit yourself.  That's why you don't cry.  If you don't want a spanking--stop doing what you're doing.

AA10832878	You probably won't like this answer. But the truth of the matter is, I felt more attracted to a guy who "wasn't" trying to get my attention so much. He doesn't necessarily have to be "shy" either. But the guys who are intentionally "trying" to get my attention, are usually the very ones who turn me off. But then, that's just me I guess. I'm not one to starve for a date or a nice time, but I like guys who are just themselves. But good luck.|`|72e63ac5a6e0204d57b5933c405af972aa	talk to her. tell her something interesting that she'll remember about you. she'll remember it and want to know more about you. oh and smell nice, we like that.|`|AA11671454	if you smell good, if you are yourself all the time, very hot, not affraid to look somewhat dumb and you are open and not shy and secluded, be out there, willing to spaek your mind and talk to the girls you like.|`|7f9b023320fafa7c4bbd58df09ff219caa	hey dude, what you need is self-confident. and make yourself available, but not needy.   try conpliments, girls loves that. but dont over due it. oh one more thing, be yourself.|`|162af65ede97e5a1888f98ca5ea62ac0aa	Confidence plays a large roll in every aspect of seduction, You can't pick up girls without knowing what to say so talk to a girl-friend and have her help you out,When approaching a girl and she is with friends, try to talk to all of them.

AA11596929	First ask yourself: Do I like him?  Then ask: is this person necessary to my survival in any real, honest way.  Not just will I miss him being around but do I depend on him to get air to breath. (hint : the answer is NO!)  If you really like him, if he's a fun guy to be around tell him so.  But do not under any circumstance let him or anyone else tell you that you have to 'put out' in any way to keep his interest.  If you do, honey, he ain't worth it.|`|3d2bd5deee3540ede736581cb7da08adaa	guys like girls who preform oral sex on them|`|AA12201841	feelings fade if not meant to be|`|6ecb2771be76778f74f835cc44945fa7aa	You should read up on mind control so that you can alter the way he thinks and make him like you, or you could just move on.|`|a5e24eca13dedbc5d128412b002b909faa	Every relationship seems to follow the same track:  First the guy seeks out the girl.  He gets her attention and spends a lot of time talking to her or emailing her.      After a while he feels more secure and spends less time communicating.      Meanwhile, the girl is getting more into him and wants more communication.      When he holds back, he's either doing it because he isn't thinking about it (by accident), or he's doing it because that is what guys do when their girlfriends start acting needy (as a reaction to you).      Let him have his space, and you will learn that he will even out the communication levels and eventually you will lose your insecurity over him.      If he really is  losing interest in you, there is absolutely nothing you can do except trick him into being with you, but who wants a guy they had to trick?  That is just wrong.|`|0b8e9bc5a8483f9bf5d41f23e1f9d588aa	first of all u have to sure that u not that easy to be forgotten or ignored...   what u have to do ...  he give u signs what if u take Ur turn ... what if u show him that u like him but not that much ... like u tell him u  not that big to  ignoring me man, i am a busy girl and there is more interesting things in life.  he could do that just to make u fired inside or to make u go to him running....  u should have a cold reaction for everything u do u must think and i am telling u when girls think first there always be tough:)  stop ur heart and use ur mind till u got him.  and after u do that it will be good if u disappear for a Little time and make him ask himself ...did i do something that bad .. did she forgot about me ... but don't be over reacted ;)  hope that help and u will got him girl ;)  good luck
AA10029927	First, know that time is the only true cure for heartache. Time heals all wounds. Cliche? Sure, but very very true.     Second, eliminate all the evidence of him, in your emails, pictures, friends, places, etc. You don't have to throw away the memorabilia just yet, but grab a box and dump all his reminders into it. It'll be really sad and difficult, but after wards you'll feel accomplished and stronger. Put that box away until you're ready to throw it out. Go through your inbox, do search with his name, and put all emails into a folder separate from your regular inbox, so you won't randomly open something that will strike up feelings.    Finally, forget all the things he did that were nice and good memories. Forget them! Reminiscing over them is pointless. The guy cheated, he threw all that away and negated any dignity he held with you in the past. Consider it all BS. When you find yourself starting to idealize him, remember what he did to you, how he hurt you, how he left you, etc.  Acknowledging that he is the JERK he has proved himself to be.     In the meantime, keep yourself busy. Invite friends over every day, even to just sit with you. Each day, week, hour will get better with time. In the meantime, make it easier for yourself by taking a bit of my own advice.     Remember, it only has to work out ONE time. Only once!|`|AA11452325	Be strong, Never look back, You are better off with out him at least you don't have to deal with him now. And he cant hurt you any More.

I'm currently in the same situation.  When I moved to NC back in July; I realized that I wasn't over my ex - even though I knew that he didn't deserve me.  So, I've given myself permission to grieve.  My grieving process ends in Nov. before the holidays.    When you've been together that long, it's hard to let go.  But, this fool cheated on you!!!  You're not losing anything by walking away.    So, cry your tears and move on!|`|3a705bf0321bf4809136d6a880ae5862aa	Think of the breakup as a break-over.  Get a break-up buddy.  Go to your local bookstore and get "It's Called a Break-Up Because It's Broken" by Greg and Amiira Behrendt (I think that's how you spell it).  I was with my ex for 2 1/2 years, and reading that book helped me.  I know, it seems stupid a book helps?  Great tips though.    This break-up is an opportunity to give your life a makeover, take full advantage of it!
AA12082300	First of all you need to figure out if you REALLY love him and why.  You say you love him cause you have nobody else??? That IS NOT LOVE!!? If you asked him all these questions then you shouldnt have to write him a letter to tell him you need a break. If you BOTH love each other I might suggest you try counseling. That usually helps couples deal with issues they are going through this helps themm with a median. That way it doesnt bring everyone in your business and taking sides. But that is only if you both want to work it out and see what is the problem after six years what has caused all this and in the end you may turn out to be made for each other or really good life long friends. Writing him a letter is impersonal and could leave him bitter and angry. So I say all this to say counseling if you want to work it out or sit down and tell him that though you have enjoyed the time you have spent together you feel it is time for a break. You need time to find yourself and what you want in life. If he cares anything about you he should be able to respect that it may or may not hurt him for a while but a good oerson will accept that you need some space.|`|76ef326faf4cfc8d48af8f7a406b5824aa	From your questions you sound young,if you have been in a relationship with this man for 6yrs and you have never met his family then more than likely you are the OTHER WOMAN I don't mean to be ugly but this guy is either married or co-habitating with either a man or a woman,the fact that he's not taken your relationship to the next level in 6yrs should send you a message loud and clear he has no intentions of doing so and it' sad because you are being deprived in so many ways I think you should move on and wait because a good man is out there somewhere and will be willing to introduce you to his family proudly as well as be commited to you and maybe marry you when you both are ready so don't feel like you are stuck with such a man who has no respect for you.|`|9ef0184b7a455b577346d08125a50225aa	Obviously he has something to hide either from you or his family i suggest you let him know how you feel and it has been long enough either he gets serious about you or you need to move on sweetie
5a54e2697082d9a8e720cccc9fd07933aa	I am guessing that since your saying Returning the Favor, it means you both have done oral sex with each other.  Sometimes it shows love when you do that and he likes it. But most of the time he will just think it feels great. It really does. But i think if hes always sour and lame when you don't do it, that means hes probaly only in it for that. Don't give it to him for awhile, and see how he responds, if he acts sour and lame all the time for no reason, hes only in it for that.|`|d07fab5037e9cbe36ad592502675a685aa	He is very selfish, "it" works both ways.

They both tell me the secret to their happiness is that each one always puts the other ones happiness first.  They respect each other and always mind their manners, never bad mouth one another to friends, and do nice little things that they know the other enjoys.  They also have a date night ever Thursday and he buys her flowers once a week.  She goes out of her way to make sure he has a nice dinner and he surprises her with small gifts.       I was married for 17 years and my husband expected me to do everything and farted and belched all the time.  That got old!  I am now in a relationship (for one year and counting) and I find my friends' advice is very helpful....I treat him like he's the most important person when we're together, I don't bash him to my friends--even when I am irritated with him, and I try my best to always be kind to him.  He has told me that he has never had a girlfriend treat him so well, and in turn, he treats me wonderfully.    Best of luck to you!  And congratulations on making it this long.

AA11128712	Hi bg!  No, you're not annoying at all - I'd be happy to help if I can.  Probably best if you email me and we can chat that way.  I'm at philk@homechoice.co.uk    OK - well, a lot depends on how much experience you've both had of erotic spanking.  From what you say I assume you're both newbies?  And of course I don't know how much persuading he'll need - some guys are very resistant to the whole idea.  They think it's 'weird' or 'perverted', or that a man shouldn't hit a woman even if she wants him to.    But assuming he's ok with the idea - first off, agree a safeword you can say if it's really getting more than you can take.  (This shouldn't be something like 'Stop!' or 'That hurts!' that you might say as part of the game.  Choose something completely unrelated, like 'bananas'.)  If you use it, he should stop, no exceptions.    Then get him to put you across his knee and take down your panties.  (Otk and bare-bottomed is always best.)  If you want to play-act a little, a bit of dialogue can help the mood - things like "You've been a very naughty girl, and naughty girls get spanked good and hard on their bare bottoms!"  You could try "Don't you dare!  Let me go!" or "Oh please honey, don't spank me!  I promise I'll be good!"    He should start spanking you quite gently to start with, pausing now and then to stroke and rub your bottom - and maybe stroke down between your legs, to see how wet you're getting.  Gradually he should spank harder, telling you how pretty your bottom looks now it's getting nice and red, and how much you deserved to be soundly spanked.  (This first time he should probably only use his hand - later on, if you want, you can experiment with paddles, hairbrushes, etc.)  Don't be afraid to yelp and wriggle - that all adds to the fun.    By now, both of you should be getting very turned on and ready to make love.  If he's been stroking you intimately, you may already well have had an orgasm or two.  You might want to go down on him - lots of girls like to reward their spanker with a bj.  If you're going for penetration, doggy-style is great - feeling a girl's hot spanked bottom-cheeks against his belly as he enters her is delicious for a guy, and in that position he can add a few more swats to enhance the effect of the spanking for you.    But the key thing is that you should both communicate.  Tell him what you want, how you've always imagined it happening.  And he should pay close attention to your reactions and body language while he's spanking you, to know whether he's spanking too hard or not hard enough.     Does that cover it for you?  If not, email me for anything more you want to know.  And have fun!|`|52c6efd2a28acae483cd9a08949f7789aa	cool i like spanking too
AA11196130	I have a dream similar to that. Sometimes I scream in my sleep & flay my arms. Once I hit my hubby. He has to wake me up. This usually happens when I eat heavy meals late. For me, thats after 8 pm. Sometimes it happens when I am stressed out. I take it to mean that my subconscious is letting my conscious know that there is an overload. Other than that I don't give it much thought.|`|4c03ca2af0670791eae96802dcc67d06aa	Dreams are God's way of trying to tell you something.  If you have the dream again, try to see who it is that is standing over you.  Is it someone you know?  Depending on who the person is, the message could be different.  You just have to think of what type of message the person could be trying to send you.  Also, look for other clues in your dream.  Try to remember everything you saw, felt, heard, or otherwise sensed.  Everything is a clue.  For instance, my uncle died in 1990.  Then shortly thereafter my other uncle saw him and knew something was wrong.  The next day, he went into my cousin's room and found that he was extremely ill.  Some dreams are full of clues, while others are direct and to-the-point.  I know this boy who had a dream one night that his mother was in a serious car accident and died.  He ran downstairs and told his grandmother about it.  Then the next day, they found out that at the same time the boy had the dream, the accident really happened, just as he'd dreamed it.  It was sad.  The point is, though, that if you can't figure your dream out after thinking about what clues it may be trying to give you, don't worry.  Your dreams will probably get more detailed.  If it's something you need to know, you will.  Otherwise, I wouldn't worry about it too much.    Hope this helps.|`|9a0a376bc62e28789f2eb8e97cad6606aa	I have no idea dear... but i wish you good luck , maybe someone will answer your question !!!|`|44e3cf7a846e07c49b4fec05526dfb24aa	It's Freddy Kreuger...remember, it says he can only get you in your dreams...whatever happens there, happens in real life.

Nenhum homem respeita uma mulher assim. Eu penso que vc pode at transar com um cara no primeiro encontro, mas tem que ser algum especial e que vc j conhecia de alguma maneira, j trocou olhares, algumas palavras, que vc pense que tem algo em comum e te transmita algo bom.

AA10980851	well if you really like her, i'd do what she asks. who knows. maybe she won't be able to resist your charm the more you hang out with her. she's probably afraid of what your intentions are since you're the first guy to ask her out.|`|c5988e177b282dd45218c192d0e97c80aa	I think you should give it a try b/c she might turn out to be a pretty cool girl.|`|c81b7462b6ab2169f1fd66cfea689dc4aa	no, not untill she is ready. you should invite her to a movie or something with a group of your friends and some of her friends.|`|a23c5f4d1193fc5b119200baa494ab77aa	well. i think she wants to get to know you more before you guys go out. give her some time, be friends with her first. show her how much fun you are when you guys are together. eventually she`ll fall for you and end up with you. good luck ! =]|`|234bbbbeeaa4bcfa72922d7eb76a5f55aa	how old was she????????|`|7db94a6d6b427b1d1d4ca14268603921aa	It depends on you. if you are really interested in her, go ahead.   Most of us would want to get to know a guy first before committing to a relationship. If you stay around, then that proves that you are really sincere with your feelings( if you really like her?).  Who knows, she might change her mind. Most of us do once we are swept off our feet.|`|4b62c18c6660199c29bafcb64656d152aa	ok...so see if she'll hang out with you and some mutual friends...maybe hang out at someone's house and watch movies or something like that let her get to know you without asking for a committment...she's probably just scared that (a) your joking or (b) your trying to take advatage of her...going from personal experience...i would pursue|`|4862d823b7db59c95a1b7950a4d93dc5aa	ease into it, but don't become creepy stalker boy. (that's just weird)    =]|`|63ccdcfbfd1402381fdafb6a3620502faa	yes , pursue don't pressure her. i can tell you from experience that when u pressure a girl into a relationship just the smallest bit it can set your relationship back a "LONG" time so although you cant have your relationship right now don't sweat it just give it time and it will all work out that's what i did i now I'm with the girl that wasn't ready so just give it time it'll all be cool|`|d7e087f65f8fa56097e77f898248e691aa	Yep.  She didn't say "no" flat out, so she probably likes you.|`|f763302d78061e138a8b0e356e100b1aaa	IF u really like her then ofcourse!!!! If u have a crush on her then don't give up. Hang out with her more and become friends. Get 2 know her better and show her what a gr8 guy u r. Be there for her like a loyal friend. Then when she thinks the time is rite, she might say yes! Good Luck!|`|ecc540618160bb9f3e06804e98b60ecaaa	as she said she she was never asked b4. she had no experience with answering and was put on the spot. she doesn't want to say "no" but is unsure about "yes" yet. persue, but not to the point of being annoying.|`|AA10846892	yes.|`|65944e7a12a79015ea8fb3dd838dadaeaa	you should probably wait untill shes ready because if u keep "persuing" when she isnt ready u might scare her off. But just wait untill she is ready, you will know when the time is right|`|AA10928222	you should talk to her and get to know her better  because that is how a relationship starts out  give it time trust me
AA10185921	Your point blank answer, is that he's getting too excited, and he's not thinking about controlling himself....that could perhaps be a huge compliment on your behalf.  Over time, he'll settle down and things will sort of work themselves out.  If you don't want to wait that long, then help him to concentrate on containing himself.  Maybe you two can only foreplay a few times before you decide to "go for it all".  This should help him also, as well as learn about each other in your likes and dislikes of that nature.|`|4f48701617d5cb3fc62e4b7ffbee2d47aa	Just take it nice and slow ... things will resolve themselves eventually ....   You could try doing him by hand then a short time later start all over again with you getting him to pay you more attention in the begining ... then he might not be so "fully charged" and be able to restrain himself ....  If he's told you he's done it before (heaps of times) with no problems ...he's probably full of crap and just trying to impress you with his experience .... patience .... all things come to those who wait (so to speak) ...lol|`|AA12244965	...Overly excited my as$. He's prematurely ejaculating. It takes him training and control over it to get over it. You  know how you can squeeze and release your vaginal muscles to hold in your pee and whatnot? That's kind of what he has to do. Someone else above me listed a method you can try...try it, but otherwise, he is being a puss and his excuse is lame. It's almost as if he just doesnt' want to have sex with you..but wants a quickie and begone. Eh.|`|7d36e014309209a2730f9cc3f4c81e25aa	u cant be that fine or ur mans a wimp|`|AA11175392	just be with him to let him feel confertable with you...then he wont have problem doing it!|`|7cf84246c405db9a08e9036c0d4c8518aa	How old are you?    Is he wearing protection?    Are you sure he has done it before?    Sometimes the grip of a condom can help slow him down. Also maybe he should take care of things himself before you all get together. Maybe even more than once if hes THAT excited.    If this is your first time please please please be very safe and very very very sure this is what you want to do...     I almost feel guilty about giving you this advise.. but please please please be safe.|`|AA11811837	yea maybe u should put a back over your head. lol|`|d40fd258467f0e5dcf0ee94c2bcc4a23aa	There are methods of training the penis.  One method is called the start stop method.  You basically jack him off and when he feels it penetrating, you stop.  It's kind of a tease, but it trains it.  And you keep doing that over and over.  Look it up on the internet.  I learned it in Human Sexuality.
9e09040508e66e25717c333012649676aa	Not to downplay the guy necessarily but does he feel similar to you? He is in a band after all and he meets heaps of people all the time, perhaps you are just one of many to him? Think also how deep are these feelings you have? Maybe thinking about all this is premature.    I'd strongly advise you keep your job though, its not always easy to find a job that is so important to you. Remember that if he is into you then maybe it could also be him who considers cutting back on the band.    Something else to consider is that if you care about him and what is best for him then you will obviously not want to affect his career and where it will take him, and maybe you can find peace in the fact that you let him go to pursue his dream.    I hope your path becomes clearer to you in the near future!   Good Luck :)|`|AA11447057	BACK OFF|`|88f525847b73501f8d60644421168159aa	I say try, and see what happens.

Good luck!|`|4178c840cb6c60540ec9e555f738e2f3aa	If you can't be with this person, the only way to let him go is thru distance and time..The longer you are away from him(dont see don't phone don't talk) the easier it should become to let him go. When you let go of someone its almost like a death and you need to mourne and then move on.  Don't get caught up in what you CAN"T have-try what you can have..try safe dating(speed dating can be fun) or blind dates at a safe spot..finding the right person will help.|`|a02598c894e22c851d437f1d40054bcfaa	try talkin to him... but dont get turn into a maniac.... if its meant to be then it will work out no matter what... good luck|`|82d0a780842f52753920f04c634d4129aa	try 2 find a better guy so u would forget him sooner or later

AA11386281	OK, Steve.  Yes, you are an attractive man.  If I were younger (a LOT) and unmarried I'd look two or three times.  (I'm also into kendo so I can kick ***!)    BUT - just because you admire someone you shouldn't change your name.  There's only one of you - please don't try to clone yourself into someone else.  You sound pretty hot just the way you are.    By the way, I don't want anything from you for this...I mean it from the heart, so take it in the spirit I gave it.|`|AA10928222	yeah your not bad looking|`|600e95960aa11f55df9e0bbf739839bbaa	I think you are a very attractive guy.

AA11020911	Omg. *sends virtual hugs* I feel like that too. I need somebody to lean on, but nobody is there.. I need a hug... holiday depression always gets me. This plastic box is one of the things that is helping me through these dark times. *stiffles tears* I hope you feel better soon.|`|586a602e584fc54aff7a76f447de5823aa	Well, this is probably not what you want to hear, BUT...    Until you're happy with who you are you'll never find happiness with someone else.  One thing i've learned in my travels is that women like a confident person  If you're trying too hard ( and it seems like you are) women generally won't respond to that.  I picture you as a person who is shy.  This isn't a bad thing, but you just have to work on your confidence.  Get a hobby, like......i dont' know.... anything... when you do that, you're doing two things.  First you're taking the focus away from finding someone, and you're going to be in a better position to socialize.  As you progress in your hobby, the better at it you will be and this will increase your confidence.  This will make it easier to talk to girls without getting nervous....Remember:  Girls like a relaxed confident guy, not a nervous uptight guy...    I wish you luck, brother.  You remind me of me back in the day.  Just keep a positive attitude and you'll be beating away the girls with a stick!!!! Good luck :)

Sometimes guys aren't sure about dating there best friends because a lot of the the friends aren't friends anymore. But I think if he feels what you feel the connection will just be too strong to break. Love is a silly thing, but when you start to have feeelings for someone... you have to let them know. Destiny is what we all have but the courage to go through with destiny is what we live for. Good Luck and Happy Holidays!|`|984ee883727e20a32ddb47d260772eb5aa	Tell him how you feel.

I woudn't date my friends best friends, ha, talk about asking for useless drama. If she left her boyfriend/your best friend, then it may only cause drama between you adn your friend. But if you just let her stay with your friend and do her thang, then, well, I think it'd be better that way. I'm already frowning on the fact that just b/c you didn't have feelings for her, she decided to date your best friend.

Do you have anything in common with men that would make them want to be friends with you? 90% of my friends are guys because we communicate better than I do with girls, and we're all laid back, low maintenance, and I like to have fun without fussing about my nails or hair. If you can talk to a guy and keep him intrigued, that should be enough for a friendship....so, maybe you should start the convo's instead of waiting for them to talk to you. However, I also realized that when a guy and a girl are "friends" it's b/c one wants more and the other doesn't. Sad, but I'm damn serious. So, most guys prob look at you and want more, and being that you just want friends, you'd have to make that clear to them and then wait for a respectful guy to respect your wishes and be your friend instead of being selfish and ignorant that you won't **** him and thus leads him to treat you like shet.|`|dd46e961f01f08857950bcc3172fbaefaa	read more about sports and political stuff~ guys love those things~|`|ea7f602b2520f7e8fc339012d74abcb6aa	Its difficult I don't like getting too friendly with girls as I end up falling for them sooner or later lol.
a90028da114c63a179eb162a21289bf5aa	Sweetheart, I am almost 40, and I am a man.  My ex-wife got old way before her time.  She was saying, "I am too old for this s**t," before she was 30.  And now, she looks it, and she acts like it.  She also did not like the fact that I have foreskin, actually a lot of foreskin, but that is beside the point.  That was just an example of her tunnel vision.  She wants to get old.  I do, too, but I don't want to lose my youth doing it.  Yes, I have been there, done that.  I still get carded for beer at Wally World.  Imagine that.  My gf just turned 21 this summer.  No, it's not a matter of this old guy keeping up with her, but it is the other way around.  No, I don't have to use any ED drugs.  I just refuse to get old--in the traditional sense.  Maam, I mean no offense by this at all, but it sounds like you and I should possibly spend some quality time together.  I am only talking about talking.  Nothing else.  Please don't take that the wrong way.  I would love to see a picture of you.  No, not a naked one, but one of your face.|`|2193ae92b5caad4992891d4679fe4eefaa	If he looks like hell, get another guy.

Not having the material struggles of our parents and with a world full of toys and opportunities we put off the traditional trappings of adulthood till later in life.We see it as a choice between having or not having fun. When the choice is really between  taking what we learnt from this point in life and taking it and moving on developing finding fun in other places. This must be a conscious effort. It wont just happen. Your partner has grown up in the proper sense of the word, just like a caterpillar must one day turn in to a butterfly so must you.   If not now when.

AA12244965	You're being paranoid. There could've been an attraction between them, and maybe not; they could've just simply have been socially friendly. Otherwise, there was not enough of anything going on for you to be throwing a drama fit over it; get over it. Gain some trust... in both of them... until they prove otherwise.|`|8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	Listen to "Crazy"  Crazy, I'm crazy for feeling so lonely  I'm crazy, crazy for feeling so blue  I knew you'd love me as long as you wanted  And then someday you'd leave me for somebody new  Worry, why do I let myself worry?

And remember that Love is about trust.|`|ae3e1243969cb203908a0b52e9da0cd6aa	they were both flirting with each other and trying to fool u. the fact that he has to tell u that u dont trust him is the first sign he did do something wrong.  keep away from both of them for a few days and see i have a feeling they will hook up and leave u high and dry

I'm wondering what he did.  If he made an unsolicited sexual approach that is really wrong and you have good reason to  avoid him...but if he just talked to one of your friends or something like that, maybe you could find it in your heart to forgive him.    Honestly, are you just playing hard to get with him?  Just make sure you are being sweet.|`|AA11284720	They never listen!!!!!!!!!!!|`|cb6d1ca8828552062200246b87874f07aa	Maybe he's only doing it because you're telling him not to.

Certo e' che  sarebbe molto difficile per te essere il suo migliore amico quando si vede che sei cosi innamorato. Forza e coraggio parlane con lei!!!!|`|82d5a4047e8c8bd4a206fb1697983d37aa	lo so che piuttosto di perdela preferisci tacere i tuoi sentimenti....ma soffrire in silenzio non ti servir a nulla!!  Secondo me, per vivere in pace, dovresti confessarle tutto il tuo amore. Hai il 50% di possibilit.......o la "perdi" (ma sappi che sar solo finch le cose non si sono appianate, perlo per esperienza), o si render conto che anche tu per lei non sei solo il suo migliore amico!!  Perch sai, cos non  vivere........rischi solo di darle i consigli sbagliati nella vana speranza che lei si avvicini a te. E cos non  giusto!|`|bdd10f62de0dfee6b4856af4c184c65caa	Parla con lei e dille quello che provi.  Non torturarti con questi pensieri.....lei che ti confida cose intime fatte con un altro...

Non so se comprendi il mio discorso!|`|89b66292fdc0c43aa34582cbe8c62c35aa	Il meraviglioso rapporto ormai non  cos meraviglioso, almeno non per te, perch soffri. Se tu la ami, una vera e propria amicizia non ci sar mai tra voi, da parte sua forse si, ma dalla tua parte no. Quindi fai male a te stesso. E semplice dire, e semplice dare i consigli, lo so, ma secondo me la cosa migliore che potresti fare sarebbe a dirle la verit. Poi vedi come reagisce, e da quel punto puoi prendere altre decisioni.|`|9b09c6c78a73326c7892e586d78bc8b1aa	io al tuo posto cercherei di conquistarla!!!|`|103e416816cd86ac97b07de505887751aa	Io penso che lei abbia capito che tu provi dei sentimenti diversi dall'amicizia. Per essere sicuro al 100% che per lei sei solo un amico, dovresti fidanzarti con un'altra, oppure trovare un'amica che ti faccia da complice fingendo di essere la tua ragazza (fatti baciare anche davanti a lei). A quel punto incominci anche tu a confidarle delle cose che potrebbero renderla gelosa (dovresti accorgertene dai suoi atteggiamenti e dalle sue risposte). Se vedi che lei parla con naturalezza anche dei tuoi argomenti privati vuol dire che non  innamorata di te e quindi il mio consiglio  di fidanzarti con un'altra ragazza e allentare i vostri incontri. Cmq il mio migliore amico  diventato in seguito il mio ragazzo e ci sono stata per 8 anni. La tecnica che ti ho descritto  stata quella adottata da lui e come vedi   riuscito nel suo intento. Evidentemente io non mi ero accorta ancora di amarlo perch lo avevo sempre a mia disposizione|`|4e5e443d41777a4d8835bb5602c5ad81aa	stare cos non ti aiuta quindi diglielo...tenta il tutto per tutto se ti piace veramente

If she didnt care... did she leave you to rot out on the street? Are you starving with no food cuz she wont give you any? Do you have to go to school naked cuz you have no clothes?    if mostly your answer is no, then she does care and love you...but she's just trying to hide it probabaly or she has problems of her own...maybe if she asks I'll answer :-)|`|AA10993379	EVERYONE HAS A FIGHT SOMETIME IN THERE LIVES.

Believe me my friend...it is true when they say that our parent's love for us is best seen in their concern and obsessiveness for us and sometimes in their anger too. Our Mums always has wonderful dreams for us which normally are the ones which they couldnt fulfill in their lives and they would have promised themselves that I will never let my child take the wrong steps in life I have taken! So when they feel that we are even stepping a liitle on that wrong foot...they are all alarmed and wired and freaked out! It's not a bad emotion to have...it all comes from LOVE! love for you..love for their little one...however grown up we are...we will be always there little ones.

Tal vez te parezca raro que te sugiera que optes por callar sino sabes que decir, pero hay veces que el silencio vale ms que mil palabras. Y si te sirve de algo te cuento que yo hace tiempo perd a mi mam por causa de la misma enfermedad que tienen el padre de tu novio, y te puedo asegurar que mientras viv eso, prefer que no me digeran nada, porque a veces te dicen cosas que no son crebles y que te hacen sentir tonta.

AA11542626	Ouch! THAT is the very saddest story I've heard in a long time. Is he involved with the mother of his child?  If he's still single, maybe you shouldn't give up too easily, but you also don't want to disrespect his wishes.  If he has a new love in his life,  just go ahead and cry and move on with your life.  We all meet people for different reasons, and they're not always for the reasons we think or hope they are.  He may have been part of one very valuable lesson you had to learn, so consider it a life-enrichening experience. It wasn't wrong of you to travel, and you might have resented him if you never went. I guess we can't have two different things at once.  I am truly sorry and I hope the next time you fall in love, it'll be so deep you won't let it slip though your fingers. It really is better the SECOND time around.|`|AA11328507	Well he has moved on and you should too.

There is no reason to contact him and screw up what he has going with his new family.       It sounds like if you put your heart and mind to something you are successful.  You should put the same effort into finding someone as you put into your career the past few years.    Good luck.

Una de las razones es justa: Farrell no tiene el carisma necesario para sostener sobre sus esbeltos y dorados hombros el peso de una leyenda como la de Alejandro. La otra razn del fracaso est a la vista: la historia de un guerrero trolo, que cuando no est matando gente entre geseres de sangre se dedica a mirar arrobado a su novio y a dedicarle unos parlamentos potentsimos, no es para el espectador promedio. Habra que hacer el experimento y editar una versin en DVD, reemplazando a Hefestin por una Hefestiona, y ver que pasa. Y de paso lo digo: los que se quejaron de la homofobia o la cobarda de la pelcula porque la nica escena de sexo es heterosexual, cuando el 90% de la combustin protagnica es gay, se equivocan: las escenas de "amor platnico" entre Alejandro y su enamorado tienen ms fuego que la saga entera de "Animal trainer" de Roco Siffredi (y eso que son ms de 10).    Y es cierto que la pelcula est llena de defectos, y que Stone es un descontrolado, ?pero por qu no? Corre sangre, digital, de la buena; los efectos no molestan (si hay una escena en la historia del cine que NECESITA todos los efectos posibles es la entrada de Alejandro en Babilonia); y hasta el kitsch funciona (esos castillos llenos de odaliscas me hicieorn desear una versin de Las Mil y una Noches filmada por Peter Jackson y del tama?o de El Se?or de los anillos). Hay hasta kitsch idiomtico: a medida que Alexander invade nuevas tierras aparecen nuevos personajes, que hablan INGLS pero con distintos acentos (??). Angelina Jolie quiere ser la Cleopatra de Elizabeth Taylor, y aunque no aparece envuelta en una alfombra, lo hace envuelta en serpientes...    Stone prende todas las ca?itas voladoras, pero algunas estn hmedas: ah est esa msica atronadora cada dos minutos y ese argumento mal hilvanado y que se permite saltearse eventos fundamentales de la historia...    Pero la desmesura ms grave de Stone es argumental: en el intento de "humanizar" a Alejandro, lo infantiliza. Cuesta creer que el guerrero ms importante de la historia no era ms que un nene de mam, llorn y caprichoso, atolondrado y paranoico.     En conclusin: es mucho mejor que Troya (aunque ms no sea porque est contada con mayor conviccin y porque ac los novios son novios, no "primos"). Ojal que la pelcula sea redescubierta en DVD, una vez que haya pasado este tsunami de crticas absurdas.    PD: El que quiera una versin alternativa de esta misma historia, puede recurrir a la cancin de Caetano - "Alexandre" de su disco "Livros" -, un gran alarde de virtuosismo y poesa y que dura 36 veces menos que la versin de Oliver Stone.|`|857ca0dccf1b38ab5d2a82f404c39544aa	me parece que casarse es mala idea.  no estupido pero mala idea absolutamente.  en eso concuerdo|`|eb3b94e49f38e3c9d1ac9d0c70b0bd7baa	Te apoyo en eso, yo nunca me case solamente convivi con mi ex- y ya tenemos un hijo y despues de un tiempo nos tuvimos que separar no era lo mismo.

e56ba043a3d9611c690df1ff81c57feeaa	It's absolutely unrealistic for us to believe that our man has NEVER loved anyone else, although I understand the hurt and uncertainty that it can bring to our womanly minds.  Still, I think you have to look at it from a place where you should be happy he loved other women and that he is now with you...that is what makes you special.  It's just a retraining of the mind.  Try not to stress about it, or go over it in your mind again and again, just be happy with what you have.  Good luck.|`|14e07331d6f9c83e64d41d961de964b3aa	I don't know and don't care!

Fine if you want to be friends but until she is 17 you should do anything because you could get in trouble. I understand that you like her and that she listens and even though nothing will happen between the two of you. If something were to you could get into trouble and you wouldn't want that to happen.

You know that in the long run it'd hurt both of you tremedously.You need to not listen to the thoughts of liking her.I am 24 and I know a bunch of 16-18 year olds that I work with and even though we get along well and I care 4 them and some I am attracted to I ignore it cuz it's hurtful for everyone and if you truely care for someone you put them first and in a big way you're putting both of you first cuz you don't want anyone to get hurt.  believe me there are plenty of 24 year old women out there that will listen to you. they might not have the puppy dog eyes that looks so adoringly on you as she does but she's really a child.I hope you take what I say seriously and get in touch with your deep feelings and realize you care enough for her not to hurt yourself. I am not even mentioning sex I am just talking about emotions.  ALSO you JUST broke up with your g/f.I don't know how long you've been broken up but you should wait at least a couple of months before you persue anything with anyone for that matter so they're not the rebound girl;so that you know you actually want to be with them rather than have them as a distraction and possibly using them,even if you don't realize it at the time.

She is just a little girl and doesn't know what love is.

If you continue to let this girl kiss you, no matter what you THINK, you WILL be at the right moment when your judgement laspes. You will be hard and that one kiss will have your hardon take over and if you dont believe me, wait until you find the level of stress and fear you will feel when you find after youve "gotten off" that youre thinking "WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST DO?!?!?!?!" You cannot permit a CHILD to kiss you, youre a grown man who will find out too soon how your penis will take over no matter WHAT your head is telling you. Its what the penis does. DOnt place yourself in that situation. She listens to you because she is attracted to you, and its wrong. She doesnt have life experience to KNOW any better- YOU DO.   YOUve just admitted that you love a child and yet claim to not be a perv. My friend this is text book denial. You wanna stay out of jail and not be raped by men with aids? Keep yourself away from this girl because Im telling you as a 33 year old, your penis will cause something to happen and it WILL be YOUR fault for allowing it. You should have never let her kiss you without telling her that its not appropriate. FIND AN EXCUSE To keep away from her, no matter how sad she may seem due to it- if you enjoy freedom and if you think she WONT end up telling one of her best friends, or diaries or online journals that she is kissing you, and more, then youre a fool. I promise you, someone will find out- thats whay immaturity does, 13 year olds enjoy telling secrets, not keeping them.    youre not using your head and when youre in prison, she wont even remember you. But Runny Juan, Tony the Rock, Johnny Six Gun Mahone, Black Master Johnston and the other *** masters in prison will remember you, daily.    think thats a joke? She wont even remember you bud. And they'll use this online forum as evidence against you, its called an admission of guilt.|`|67b4dbb9707627d143870e83cc100583aa	man........... it's real trouble|`|ff4f681d12abd15830f84b3b962c0a1daa	Boy, this is against the law.

Busca hasta que encuentres aquello que te facina hacer y compartelo con otros.  El amor es lo nico que crece cuando se reparte.    Yo descanzara al novio un rato si ya no te tiene contenta, es mejor acabar pronto, para no hacer da?o si es que l te ama pero t no.    No te aconsejo que tomes decisiones importantes por ahora, hasta que ests serena.    Si te gusta leer, dale una ojeada a "Madame Bovary" de Gustave Flaubert, tal ves encuentres que se parece un poco a ti.  Capitulo XXI de "El pricipito" de Antoine de Saint-Exuperry.      Mejor espera a casarte, y espera ms para tener hijos, no son jugetitos para cuando uno esta sin nada que hacer.    Cuando uno se casa muchos dicen que se complementan uno a otro; esto puede ser cierto, pero yo opino que sera mejor primero sentirte completa t misma para compartir toda tu plenitud con aquella persona a quien ms ames, de verdad con todo tu corazn, que cuides de l, y l de ti, como la reina que eres, y sers especificamente due?a de su corazn, y l del tuyo. Para que lo cuides, lo hagas crecer, le tengas un profundo y admiracin y lo conoscas y te compenetres con l no solo en la vida sexual, para crear vida a partir de su amor; pero tambien emocional e intelectualmente.    Tambin si tienes hijo y no eres aun sper dichosa, que te haga flotar tu amor, y que en tu voz se oiga un sociego y paz indescriptibles.

I would be depressed too, if I were in your situation.   I can understand them wanting you to do your best in school, getting good grades. I'm sure you can see why as well. But ANYTHING besides the added peer pressure of school studies is a form of abuse. (To an extent anyway.) You need to talk to your parents and let them know how you feel. If they won't listen, talk to your school counselor. That is what they are there for. OK?   You can't be expected to do it all and you shouldn't. You just do the best you can. And don't be pressured into doing things you don't want to do. And don't worry about what people might think about your life just by looking at you. You know who are you, and that's all that matters!!!! Good luck!!!|`|AA12366704	talk to your parents. and if they don't listen, then talk louder. if they still don't listen refuse to do those sports. and then they'll wonder what's wrong and more than likely, they will listen to you.     my sister had that same problem. my dad pushed her into doing a lot of sports and she was playing three different sports at once in middle school. finally my sister broke down and to make a long story short, she told him to pretty much back off a little. so, my dad softened up.  my sister was also depressed and my dad took her to a counselor (psychiatrist) and he was told to buy a puppy for her, b/c it would help her heal. well, guess what? it worked. she has a puppy now and she's doing what she wants now. but, she's still responsible. she's 17 now.    anyways, that's all that i know.|`|f088fdbe8439419e4fbb8a496d7d5dadaa	well maybe thye just want ur life 2 be perfect and they over did itand dont know it,be open with them i mean im sure besides the pressure   there honist andhard working people who pay there taxes.
AA10537048	well, have you talked to him? see if you have another chance? but if agreeable do you think you would change or go back to treating him the way you did before? these are things to be issued. you gave him 3 months to get over you. you should have realized what you lost when you lost him. not returning his phones calls. How do you think that him feel? He seemed to be trying for someone he loved and the person didnt want it. Please think about this 3 months have passed and now he is dating someone and you want him back. how selfish. if things dont work with him and her, maybe he will go back to you. But dont let them break up because you inteferred. If loves is true, you both will be back together. and maybe just maybe you will treat him with love. goodluck.|`|ee990e37c19d643fe6667035763897d1aa	YOU JUST NEED TO LEARN FROM THIIS .

Be very honest and sincere the way you were in here and apologize as specifically as you can for your actions.  Make sure he knows that you made a promise to yourself to do everything in your power to not treat people this way again.    Also, thank him for everything he did do for you, be specific.  You want to make sure you communicate that you are writing this letter to make things right, not necessarily with any agenda to get him back...you HAVE to mean this though, so make sure you'll feel good about sending the letter regardless of his response.    Last, if you do meet up with him again, do everything in your power to empathize, empathize empathize.  See things from his point of view, agree with and validate his feelings, show that you care.  No more fighting and being disagreeable!!!  Thats what drove him away in the first place.    Be fun, be happy, be positive and cheerful.  Don't be fake.  (these last two sentences might sound contradictory, but if you can make it so they're not, you're golden)    Good luck!|`|AA11152588	Here you go    http://tinyurl.com/gvpno|`|638034bfa50594c88b7169a426f13a4baa	well it depends on if you wanna be a ***** or not if you do set her up if you dont just go to him you will feel bad belive me but go to him in private and apoligize for being that way and tell him the truth that you still love him and a whole lot more if he wants you he will come to you if not then he wont|`|ad8274965813e984a240e893d0b56291aa	Poor guy...I think your friend was just keeping your hopes up...  live the guy alone he diserve to be happy...|`|AA10591117	I am at this crossroads w/ my gf right now.  Al  I can tell you is this: if she chooses to be w/ me, I will let all of this go, be a past that we build upon b/c we will have to talk it out to get beyond her distance lately.  If she chooses it's not worth it to her (and I have even suggested she date other people if she wants already) I will do everything I can to erase her from my memory.  No friends, no more attention.  She gets it all or none of it.  If nothing else, never forget the pain lest you repeat it.|`|d6b0943e169c3a768e6b633602b7b651aa	Start by telling him in a little note with a rose. Give him something to see that you were a ***** to him that will show him that you have really changed.Little things showhow someone feels. You don't have to put a name on the note. He will see deep down in his heart who it is from. Start showing him that you have truely changed and that you  iss him. You better get on the ball. You can do it if you really want him back.Bring up happy times that you two had. Ask himto meet you agter school for a cokefloat or something. Think very hard. Change your style of cloths that he will notice. Dress very cute and popular. Just try really hard but don't push him away. Good luck.

Sometimes a person can be dating someone but find their true lovewith someone else. You wouldnt have to tell her of your feelings and put your "friendship" in an awkward situation but just try to spend a little more time with her. You will find out within time if shes that into you or not. I wouldnt recommend getting her to break up with her bf. That may cause conflict and she may not like you even as a friend after that.

If you could have anything you wanted, what would you like to have?    After he answers that question, ask... If you had an extra $20 to spend on yourself, what would you buy?    If he asks why you are asking... tell him you're doing a social experiment.

Most humans will live to be 70-80 years old at least. You're barely 15% through your life and you're ready to decide on love? You may like him a lot, but it sounds to me that you want so badly to experience love that you'll force whatever feelings you have and hope that its love.     Chill out, step back from your emotions and think about this: You still have more than 3/4 of your life ahead of you. Do you think this one guy is the absolute love of your life? And if he is, don't you think he'll wait until you both have a little more life experience?|`|4700eedc0461711c77e8c6a1c9d8ff51aa	love has no age , we love our mum and dad from birth so why can't we love some one else. so you are not stupid . take care|`|4fc0c632f7f5849baf22fc1964b6a29baa	YOU JUST LIKE HIM ALOT!

You like him alot. so get to know him better, and become his friend. Just because he is cute doesn't mean he has a great personality. Tell you mom, that you think that it should be a good age to like guys, but no go out with them. Then maybe you two can work something out. Trust me, being their friend first is better than flat out saying "I like you" and not even know them. Become his friend, then tell him.|`|6fbdc5b9de94dd653887d72b55ce7ce4aa	i remeber when i fell in love. it was in 7th grade so i had just turned 13. i remeber it like it was yesterday. he was my best friend. but for some reason when i saw him i got the butterflies and we dated but we broke up but i love him still and its only been like a year and a half. i guess my point is, when you love someone you know no matter the age. most people would say oh your too young to know what it feels like. BLAH BLAH BLAH! they can't tell you how you feel about someone. age isnt anything but a number. okay remeber that.|`|b497c1dd5f4ebb9a467304e614c291aaaa	That's the sort of thing moms always say, but it's not really possible to control.     If you like this boy, then that is OK in my book, and you should explore the friendship a little. But don't have sex with him because you are not legal yet and if he is older than he might end up in prison for it. And you surely don't want to end up with a baby on your hip just yet, you've still got college ahead of you and that's a pain to do if you're already a mommy.    My advice is to enjoy the friendship, but keep your virginity until you are much older.     Good luck.

If your man asked you to dress up like some chic he has a sexual attraction to what would you say? I gather you wouldn't like that none to much. Men despite the show we put on are quite fragile as it relates to our egos. The last thing you should be doing is confessing a sexual attraction for some guy...even if its a guy on television. Its okay to think what you want to get off but don't have your man acting like a specific person you got in mind. Use some stealth. Tell him  that this look attracts you..and incorporate some roleplay into it but don't tell him you into the guy. Yeah that could work with the right motivation....Get my drift! :)|`|574c8a3da3bc37ae23b737179af126ddaa	yess|`|695aa719e66e36797d5e20e185d6c34caa	you are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|f6bbe9997f6e8ef696cc2a8491dc39fcaa	It's perfectly natural - you love your man, but you're still curious about what would it be like to do it with another guy. Men do it all the time - you're doing it with your woman, but in your mind you're pretending it's Scarlett Johannsen or Ciara underneath you, instead of your woman. That's just how human sexuality works - we desire variety.

Or if you guys feel like you've known each other forever, get something that is relevant to your relationship.  Like for instance, something that reminds you of your first kiss, or the song that you guys had your first slow dance to.  But since his christmas gift was such a big deal and was more of a materialistic gift, his birthday prensent (since its like a week after!) should be something meaningful.

And that is something that if I where you I would stay far away. I think it odd that she would all of the sudden turn play into such a serious time ....that seems suspicious to me. There are many kinds of girls in the world ...you would be much happier with one who is more interested in having a good time instead of turning good times to bad..like this girl does.....let this one go....who needs a bad time all the time?....I wish you much happiness and a future of fun ...love and health!!

1c0f22e7066f8a7075aeb5f69b154ac6aa	A veces se puede pensar que cuando una persona joven se acerca a una mayor que ella, es precisamente por que quieren visualizar en esa persona a alguien querido (como la mama o el papa), pero en estos tiempos actuales, la edad es un estado mental de las personas, como hay chicos aburridos de ni?as inmaduras y buscan la compa?a de alguien mas madura en todos los aspectos, como hay mujeres mayorcitas que desean a un joven a su lado que les de la vitalidad en el ocaso de sus vida o viceversa... pienso que la edad de las personas es como te sientas y como te ves tu, a mi punto de vista personal opino que si puede existir el amor a cualquier edad, no importa si eres mayor o menor... el amor no tiene edad...|`|8a8d5777e48df7188190a46d4a141277aa	Si tiene dinero, si!|`|fc2384c8d1807c36ad0861d0e23ffe35aa	si ocurre aunque a veces es por inters, pero hay personas que aman, muchas veces buscan la proteccin de esa persona,  otras la edad le confiere a la mujer seguridad y otras mas razonables es que la experiencia impera o sea reina  en muchas cosas.|`|e7e4fc9858d831f1049fabb77c630aadaa	Aunque no lo creas existe el amor entre personas con mucha diferencia de edad.

AA10655344	Love looks beyond good looks and wealth, they say. I am sure its true, but seeing your description of this guy, I too have the same question, what did you really see in him ? Forget the ugly part, you definitely knew he could never satisfy you, or probably not physically compatible, but you have covered it up saying ''i gave up a good sex to be with someone i love'', while I appreciate your sincerity, deep inside, you really didnt like what you were doing. Perhaps you were worried about the '''we-told-you-so'' statements that you may get from your family / freinds. Get away, and consider yourself blessed. You are a beautiful woman, and you deserve the best for being sincere and committed, right ? Yes, you deserve the best. Get over it, and its not going to be easy. At this time be with your closest of freinds, or family, take time to get over this entire issue. When he comes back, with his huge bundle of lies once more, show him the door. Your question sounds like he has taken you for granted. Have you confronted him about his lies ? If not, you should. You may feel good if he tries to convince you, but the way you have described him, I doubt, if he would be faithful, or committed to you in the future. Consider that you have been saved thinking of what would happen if you were actually marrying this guy. Would you be sure that he wouldnt carry on playing behind your back ? I doubt that too.    And why is he happy and you are sad ? thats a tough question, cos' we do not know what he is feeling or saying or doing. But for your sake we know that he is playing around, and that you should just get over it. It hurts, I know, that you stood up for him, and you did give up certain essentials in life for this guy.     I am sure you'll get over this. And your life does not stop here, does it ? Theres much more to do and live for.....|`|5f583f310a6a81502e73389019b02b4baa	Now is not the time to feel sad.  Get out quickly!  Some people will make use of their body 'defects' to gain pity.  You were too trusting.  There are others who know their 'place' when it comes to whether they are the kind of men and women society deems acceptable and they are not devious when they chance upon another who would truly love them for who they are, not what they look like.      This man is obviously trying to deceive you and gain your sympathy.  You need discernment.  Quickly get out and don't let him grovel to you (he might do that knowing your soft spot); a tiger doesn't soon change his spots!  Cut all ties with him!  Even if he cries and ask for forgiveness.  Beware of those who come to you as wolves dressed in sheepskin!|`|a818b07cbce75652c30f54445eb2f03aaa	Sounds like a good guy. you better marry him|`|8eade797a87067fadec626457399577daa	You were a nice girl who was not shallow as some others are and you got used by a jerk.   There are nice guys out there just find one.   Not all men are liars just like not all women are cheating types.  You defiantly deserved better and just don't be hard on yourself.   I was used by a Filipino girl who was new to this country.  I did everything for her and treated her like  a princess and she dumped me for a college boy.   I felt bad that  I had let myself be used.  Just be careful now, because there are low-lives just like him out there that will try to be your bf just because you are hurting and needing a friend at the moment, be sure the next guy you get really deserves you and isn't just trying to use you.

It's not the cheating exactly, I mean it is, but it's more that he chose to do something deceitful while you trusted he wouldn't. You may think I'm crazy, but as bad as you feel right now, I think everyone should experience that once just so you know how badly you can hurt someone that loves you. One day your true love will come around, not that joke of a man. So, dry up your eyes, it's happened and it's over. Time to turn the page. You'll know better next time.

He feels that the only way he can get off is to screw around with other women. He probably thinks he's "god's gift". When he was created, god broke the mould so he wouldn't make the same mistake twice.    Let's face it; you are so attractive that you could gain the attentions of someone far better. Your revenge would be him seeing you with another guy who would be far better looking and possessed of more brains.    Chalk him up as a bad experience and look for your ideal in someone else. As I said before, if your looks match your avatar, then you should not be single for much longer.    Kindest regards.  Anthony.

You had feelings for him and were betrayed.  Those feelings are naturally a part of the healing process.  He is and will remain happy because he had no feelings at all.  He was the user.

Are you positive that she said your creepy?  Maybe you're friends just said that because they like her.  Say something like" I'm sorry if you've felt uncomfortable with people telling you i like you.  I told my close friend and then everyone knew."  But  If this girl really said that then i wouldn't even try.  She is calling someone creepy because they like her.  She sounds kind of stuck up

El amor como lei en otra de las respuestas si es el motor del mundo, todo gira en torno a el, es lo que te hace ver todo de otra manera.  Cuando es de pareja dicen que al amor lo pintan ciego y con alas, ciego para no ver los obstaculos; con alas, para poder salvarlos, pero tambien dicen que el amor es como un juego de azar, arrisgate a ganar cari?o o a perder el corazn.  Si porque no siempre es lo que uno espera, pero saber que has amado es algo de lo que uno debe sentirse orgulloso, si no has amado nunca te has perdido muchas cosas bellas de la vida.  Debes tener claro que el amor cambia vidas y formas de ser, te hace ser mas humano y comprensivo con el resto del mundo.  No tengas miedo de amar, si bien muchas veces no resulta como esperabas, puedes volver a intentarlo hasta que llegue tu verdadero amor.
AA11452268	I think a lot of people go through something similar to that when they are younger. The lesson is, of course, that if you're interested in getting to know someone, you should at least make an effort. Sometimes that is harder to do when you're a little shy.     In such cases, it's usually good to remember that even if you had spoken to the person, chances are very low that it ever would have turned into a long-term relationship. A first step is just that and nothing more. But sometimes we let our imaginations get the best of us, and we imagine, "If only I had spoken to him/her, we might be a couple now!"     I suppose that's only natural to some extent, but eventually you have to accept that it's nothing more than a fantasy and move on.     On the other hand, that kind of situation has been the source of a lot of great poetry writing through the century's. Petrarch's poems about his beloved Laura, to whom he never spoke, were based on exactly that kind of long-distance longing. So perhaps you could memorialize your crush with a poem as well!    Best of luck.

El que te hable a diario, te baya a recoger al trabajo y te compre todo lo que quieres no significa que te ame. Si el quiere algo de ti esta hasiendo su lucha hasta que caigas. No pienses que nadamas por que lo amas ya bas a acostarte con el. Piensa bien las cosas. A mi punto de vista tienen muy poco de novios como para ya estar juntos. No te confundas el deseo con el amor. Talves en realidad no lo amas tanto como dices y es solo una ilusion mas o talvez son sus detalles los que te hasen dudar. No tomes desisiones presipitadas. Si el te ama sabra esperar.

525f4fa6b321158328dda3f109fbbb35aa	You know, I really think you should just be happy for her, because most people will never have that, tht confidence, because people laugh at them.  And that you can see her rolls is not that bad, better her rolls, then her ribs. Because in the west your fat or anorexic. You should just be happy for her and not laugh at her.   Somewhere deep inside, she might know that people laugh at her, as long as her friends just don't make her a joke, because I think it's just good to hear that people can still be confident about something. And you just be happy for her, because if she has a change of mood and she stops eating, you come her again, asking, "how can I make my friend eat again?" Think about it, just be happy for her......    And don't laugh at her and just let things be...    Good luck.|`|93a5dbae9df18149c8a825e5a037566daa	That's a very hard position. Ummm... Tell her that your her for her in a good friend conversation way. And that to be honest, "Can I tell you as a friend. You may want to wear something a little more Conservative. Don't get me wrong sure you look good in a skirt and all, but honey you have to balance it with a little class and hide that tummy." Your not trying to hurt her feelings, but let her know that its for her own good. Be understanding and let her know about a certain out fit that suits her and your opinion to be a good match. "It's just that people talk and you and I don't want you to get hurt and I feel that as a Friend I just wanted to let you know!" I hope this is of some idea for help!|`|46ccac117ad9aa95624a90cb2b543387aa	These things can actually dent her confidence. If she feels happy in these clothes, and she thinks she looks good in them, then she just looks good in them. Why should she feel ugly in that outfit, just because you, and a couple of other people laugh at her behind her back? (Obviously, or she would have noticed for sure.) If these people are so righteous they would have told her what they thought. But they know it's mean, and they would kinda feel bad about it, to say it straight to her face. So they keep it to themselves. I think it's great that a woman/girl actually dares to wear what she feels would look good on her, even though she might not have a tight body. Why does that bother people any way? Why is there so little tolerance for these things?  I feel sad for this woman. Not because you say she looks bad in that outfit, but because she has to wear something different because of the shape of her body.  But i guess that's just the way the media had played it out for us.  So, just tell her straight out then. Maybe there's a way for her to still wear that type of clothing but with just a few changes, at least in a way, so that she won't be laughed at any more. Because that's just awfull.  I hope she can find a way to still feel pretty in her own taste of clothes, but WITHOUT the nasty laughter.|`|AA12225439	if your a friend to her then you better tell her.|`|AA11145682	tell her people laugh at her|`|384436d14895b87238e4d6a65042186daa	i would tell her that people laugh at her but dont be mean and try telling her what she would look good in.....|`|380a6af979f42c4e3778b33ff17edd04aa	i think you should tell her.wouldnt you want someone to tell you.rem.you are her friend|`|16180cfc3ec02d415d941a9cc2eeb699aa	I think you should tell her the true event she will be angry for a few moments of you but I think it will pass it.

But if you mean spanking punishments for actual faults - then yes, it happens, especially in DD (Domestic Discipline) relationships, though it's probably not all that common.  If you want, I can give you the URLs of one or two sites where it's discussed.

You can try to make gifts, such as a necklace or creative things from polymer clay. Polymer clay hardens when heated in the oven, and it's pretty easy to make masterpieces thanks to the many easy instructions on the web.  I am making a note post holder with two bunnies for my boyfriend for Christmas. You can also make keychains, pencil holders, lanterns, jewelery, candle holders...and many many other things. Check out this website, look under products for modelling. I am using the product called Fimo soft. Look under "creative tips" to see a selection of what you can make with polymer clay.    http://www.eberhardfaber.com/home_eberha...|`|dbbdd0991f6b29e631c0ca7e02f1f67caa	Love in school is just so sweet  because of that...u get her a sweet gift..

AA11452268	I think you're confusing a few homophones here. Do you mean, "Should we all write 'In God We Trust' on our mail?" Or perhaps you mean "Should we all write 'In God We Trust' on our male?"    Hopefully the former. But in either case, it probably depends on where you're sending it. If you're sending it to a business, it doesn't matter. They're not going to look that closely at your envelope anyway. If you're sending it to a friend or acquaintance, the choice is up to you. I don't think it would hurt my feelings if someone wrote "In God We Trust" on their own private letter, and I'm an atheist. I might think the person's an idiot, but it wouldn't hurt my feelings.    In other words, do as you wish, but keep the lettering small so the address is still legible.|`|472f1e599dc62d9ec49ae919ae70ea3caa	I Like IT !!|`|81944a1096fcd1bf2ed7f4059f406d55aa	Its up to the individual.  Some people don't believe in God or believe in several gods so I do believe that if:    You know the person that you are sending this to that they believe in God then you can write it, its up to you.    If you don't know, or know that they don't believe in God.  DON'T WRITE IT!!!|`|71921d2d1fa46204a573f51a100b63afaa	and who gives a flying ****?  i mean, honestly, freedom of religion right, if they don't like the quote that's been around since the beginning of the nation, they can leave.  or should we reprint and coin everything for the few damn people that care?|`|e486efb6500d9d7bf981e4462fa6bb1eaa	If you are a believer and Trust In God, then you shouldn't be afraid to make it known.I'm not!

74f8ff1edec0e089e97bb219fe20a6d6aa	Double standard much????    I sincerely don't believe that to be true. I think society puts that on genders, but people should know better.     Having more sex doesn't make you more a man. Loving one woman with all your heart and soul that is true manhood... grow up!!!|`|AA11124885	Why do you think that?  Seriously, is it because then men are afraid a woman would find someone 'better' than them?    I am not condemning you, on the contrary, I feel sorry for people who feel this way.  It displays a very poor sense of self esteem.  You are more than what is between your legs.|`|AA11480488	Stupid, stupid male.

Apparently, when men are to have sex with many women, they are considered a MAN and a "pimp" which is a good thing to them and most of society. When women are to have sex with many men, they are considered horrible and a "whore." I think women in society are suppposed to have class and be a role model to most individuals, but when it comes to men, men will have fun and do whatever is clever.|`|9939e97d5a06c3154313d225c0948568aa	Good luck trying to find a woman to agree.|`|c8904cfb6bc6f51d96cd1499e434afbfaa	That's a bit hypocritical don't you think?
dc3fa4c0463b865e5a975ed1a2a121e5aa	My question is, what happened after you he said no? I'm thinking not much, since you have a lot of questions about why? Maybe he wasn't in the mood. We can get like that too. I wouldn't read too much into his answer. Have you recently or ever turned him down when he's asked? If so, then maybe he's miffed. Either way, if you ask him again and he has another excuse, then something is wrong and you should talk about it.|`|AA11537569	You know what the same thing happened to me when I was dating the man that I later married (big mistake).  He used the same similar excuse.  It's not that you are not attractive but maybe you not attractive to him.  What man doesn't want to have sex anyway they can get it.  Think about it.  We have so many men going around masquerade as bi or gay.  He should tell you the truth about himself instead of giving you that weak excuse.  That was the same thing I said when it happened to me, I have never heard of such and I discuss this with some of my male friends and the concluded that he was gay because no guy usually turns down sex from a girlfriend especially.  However, the downside could be that he's not gay and just not interested.  I hope this helps.|`|665d66274ebebf2a5e46033f063a0cc0aa	well i have actually said that before. sex is good and great and its fun when your with someone you love. but its not everything. by him saying that its one of two things and im leaning toward the fist one. 1) he wants to spend more time with you cuddling and talking and doing things that are fun and just yall. 2) hes cheating and getting it from somewhere else and he dont want to get it a couple of times a day. but i would say one.|`|fab302d68868b9575ce55886d592b152aa	Maybe he thinks its not the right time for the move. Just take it slowly and see what happens in the future. There is a time for everything.|`|AA11333511	i know that this might sound very far fetched, but guys have their moments when they don't wanna be bothered with sex. i am sure it has nothing to do with you, but just in case you better talk to him!!|`|3d2bd5deee3540ede736581cb7da08adaa	Maybe he was wearing dirty underwear, or just finish pleasing himself, and he was done for a while.|`|AA11103696	I've never run into this problem. Sit him down and talk to him about it could be stress from somewhere other than you, maybe someone said something to him that's got him worried.    I wish just once my wife would initiate sex|`|d42bfc60ae07d6e7ca66ee67cd6a930baa	Yes, it could be alot of negative things happening behind what he said.  The problem is not the fact that he said no once, the problem should be if he continues to say no or not persue it at all.  Then you have to consider yourself in this realtionship.  Don't blame yourself on what someone else wants to do or how someone else wants to act.  You could be the prettiest gurl in the world and they will still be acting funny.  As far as advice, just wait awhile and if he is not satisfing that side of you then maybe you can talk to him about it or even go find someone else    good luck :-)
535ec6cc09638df4572a4048eb89cbd0aa	I asked my girlfriend if she was willing to try and she did.  We read about it first, learning all the do's and don'ts, hygiene, and proper preparation and lube.  Even though we took it slow, it was uncomfortable for her and we stopped.  The whole episode has earned me so many points with her, it is amazing.  It has really forged her trust with me because she knows that I will respect her wishes and not push her into anything that causes her discomfort.  It really isn't all that it's cracked up to be.  Pardon the pun.|`|3d2bd5deee3540ede736581cb7da08adaa	You have two hands if it gets to painful tell him you will use yor hands.

Y de lo que he malinterpretado es, en mi caso trata uno mejor a la mujer que le llama uno ms la atencin, hace de todo hasta si pudiera bajar estrellas lo hace, pero ellas como a uno no le llama la atencin, ellas ven eso,pero no lo valoran como uno quiere, y no es culpa de ellas por que no podemos obligar a nadie que nos quiera, entonces por ese motivo pensamos que nos hacen da?o y tal vez no es as.

That doens't mean you don't mean these things and that your mother wont take it as it is meant, but please try a bit harder.     Don't say, there are no words to describe - describe, tell your mother what she has meant to you, what she has taugh you, what good things that you can see in yourself are there becuase of her.  Give examples of when she was thougthful, caring, honest, etc.   Every one wants to be half the woman their mother was, make her understand that if you are half the person she is you will be twice the person raised by anyone else.    You don't have to be a poet to touch someone, but you have to speak your own words to them, not words anyone could use to anyone.       The fact that you want to do this ( and the particular chiches you have chosen) show your feelings for your mother.  I have no doubt she has earned them.

If you had to truly meet him and there was no stopping you, the only safe thing to possibly do is using an internet camera so that you can chat and see each other at the same time.

Ni se te ocurra mencionar:_Yo siento que no eres igual que algo pasa........................  No somos squicas,dile cosas concreta como ;te vi con ella haciendo esto,o me mentiste dijiste esto y fue esto,Pero al hacer esto,ve con una decisin,no a jugar.  En cambio si no quieres dejarlo,as tengas sospecha(Que eso no es celo)entonces trata de ser cari?osa,de atraerlo de traer conversaciones que sean atractivas y frescas,no toques el punto ,ya que no seria digno para ti,ni muy conveniente.  No le pregunte:?Me quieres?Ellos ya saben que cuando estamos celosas queremos palabras de reafirmacion,eso si pdele un abrazo tierno,un abrazo para dos.  Y aunque te parezca vulgar(muy por el contrario de mi intencin)  haz el amor como nunca antes............................  motivalo recuerdale porque se enamoro de ti ,pero no con palabras ,encontrndote a ti misma.

Lui pu essere parimenti un furbone, un gay, un bisex, un bravissimo ragazzo che sta cercando se stesso..... pu davvero essere di tutto.  Ti consiglio di partire da te stessa: cerca di capire quello che senti davvero, poi parlagli come hai fatto con noi aggiungendo tutta la tua intimit, il tuo trasporto, le tue speranze. Da quanto lo vedrai coinvolto ( coinvolto attenzione, non necessariamente innamorato o infastidito ) capirai l'interesse che ha per te.  Ma per l'amor del cielo attenta ai consigli troppo diretti, spesso frutto delle altrui frustrazioni o di immeritati successi.  Stai cercando qualcosa di enorme valore, preparati a pagarlo  caro.

Un situazione nn facile la tua! B, ma cerki un consiglio...Io non ho la sfera magica...Posso solo dirti ci ke farei io al tuo posto. Ho letto e riletto la tua domanda e mi sono immedesimata, anke xk una cosa simile l'ho gi vissuta. Io al momento non farei nulla...o meglio..."lavorerei ai fianki". Cosa significa? Ke non lo kiamerei, ma cerkerei d'incontrarlo "x caso" nei posti ke frequenta. Non mi farei mai vedere triste (ricorda...gli "amici" sono sempre un p pettegoli e riferiscono!!!), ma allegra o perlomeno "normale".  Comincerei a trattarlo da amico. Poi, se son rose...Sai, io credo ke non si possa "costringere" nessuno ad amarci. Tu meriti qualcuno ke ti ami xk TI VUOLE DAVVERO. Cercarlo, stargli dietro, assillarlo, potrebbe allontananrlo da te. Se prova qualcosa x te deve capirlo da solo....Se gi c' una scintilla di sentimento in lui, se ne accorger, tranquilla. Ed  proprio in queste feste, quando scocca la mezzanotte, quando tutti brindano, ke magari ti guardi attorno e non vedi la xsona ke ami. Magari a lui succeder questo. Si guarder attorno e ki vorr sei tu...O potrebbe anke non succedere...Kiss! In ogni caso, non devi insistere. Non  giusto per te ke non devi "elimosinare" nulla....l'Amore non si kiede...si riceve!....e  non  giusto per lui ke  stato kiaro nei suoi atteggiamenti. Ti dico questo xk secondo me lui prova qualcosa x te.Un uomo non si comporta come si  comportato lui con te senza un motivo!!! Ma magari gli  presa la paura. Una storia seria a cui non  pronto...Dagli tempo. Ricorda una frase, sempre....:. Ripetiti questa frase quando avrai la tentazione di mandargli un sms o di fargli una telefonata. A me ha aiutato molto. P.S.: a proposito...la mia situazione poi and a finire bene. Ci sono stata x 6 anni e mezzo. Ho saputo aspettare x un p. Lui si accorse da solo di quanto mi amava. Un bacione cara!!!! E fammi sapere come va  a finire!!! Io tifo x te!!!! ^_^

AA11452268	First of all,  you need to calm down. Your sentences are almost incomprehensible; perhaps English isn't your first language.    Secondly, you haven't really given us enough information to figure out what is going on; therefore, it's impossible to give you any intelligent advice. Why did this woman say she didn't want to talk to you? How well do you know her? How old is she? How old are you? Why did she start talking again? You're leaving out a lot of important details.    In general, I would say that someone who says she never wants to talk to you and then turns around and insists on talking to you is being overly emotional and irrational. Talk to her if it's important to do so in order to solve so important issue in your life. But if it makes no difference on way or another, I would say to avoid her in the future. She sounds like a drama queen, and being involved with her can lead to nothing but more trouble.

I'm sure age doesn't make a difference if you love someone.|`|e069774081a7cf92ae47ebb6ad4b2b8faa	your not crazy, but ummm, you have to stop thinking about him....i know that sounds dumb, but its not love...its infatuation, if you wait it out a few more months, and try not to think about him or anything, he will slowly slip your mind and you will move on....LOL, and your not crazy....|`|ef277bd90e5f8793015bd48c2f9585f2aa	So, you are just infatuated with him? It is not something called love?     Based on my experience, if it is infatuation, no matter how hard you try to preserve it, the feeling will ALWAYS disappear. Do not worry.
