I have never been the vain person or the one with the low self esteem or has never cared what others had to say about me because my actions not words said more of who I was.I am 5'5",24 years of age and weigh 120 lbs. at the most.I am very petite but have not always been like this where I wear a small or xs in clothes and a size 0 and 2 in jeans.My friends say that I have a nice body but no matter what I do I feel that there is some body part that I do not like: one day it is the stomach which I want to be flat, legs,etc.A couple of times when I went out with my then bf of almost 3 years,now ex, I started talking about calories,fat and what not.I usually am like "everything in moderation".If I want something I will have a bit of it and not deprive myself but since I took this Kinesiology class at a community college to get my Associates I think that I started to obsess to much about working out and food.Don't get me wrong I love food but I also like to cook healthy versions of the things I like yet remember how in HS I weighed more than I weigh now,how I wore bigger sized clothes(mediums) and a size 3/4 in jeans.I am wondering how can I stop wasting my time being unhappy about the way I look when everyone else looks at me and sees someone pretty but I see the other way.Does it have to do with low self esteem and if so should I work on that?

Hi,    I have a little acne situation going and I just recently bought some Stridex pads.  The directions say to clean your face first before using them.  The reason I bought them was so I can quickly wipe down during the day without having to worry about finding water, facial cleaners, etc.    What happens if I just wipe down my skin with them during the day or after sweating?  What would happen?  And why do I have to cleanse first?    Any information provided would be great...Thanks!

Do you believe Cute or Hot is better?   2. Do you believe a person is stuck in either one? Or can they change?   3. Do you believe the individual can be declared both by other individuals?   4. What about the word Beauty? That is the ultimate, and the English language declares cute and hit do only be synonyms of beautiful or handsome. Do you believe those would be the ultimate, long term, and better terms?   5. Other languages (such as Asian, European(French, Polish, Russian, German, Greek) don't have slang/synonyms for beauty, just the main with more adjectives, how do they manage, and could you go without them. Is hot/cute simply an American dillusionment?   *Please note you don't have to answer all questions.

20090202160116AAtB6mT	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Should a twelve year old girl curl her hair, shave or wax her eyebrows or wear eyeliner and only eyeliner?	Anyway, I have this close twelve year old tomboy cousin who recently figured out that she looks like a boy... because of her long, strait black hair and eyebrows that meet in the middle and noticeable whiskers which were previously covered by acne. Now she's wondering if she looks like a boy... I have no experience at ALL with make-up whatsoever...      Anyway... she wants to wear eyeliner once in a while, because she likes to fiddle with her fingers and such... (she plays several instruments, often braids my hair and is untying the hundreds of knots that binds my shoelaces together as we speak, or type... XD)... and is starting to want to look pretty, I think...      For Halloween, she used make-up for a witch... and I guess she liked it... She sometimes where purple nail polish or something...       The tiny eyebrows in her hair are becoming noticeable... and so are her whiskers...      So... I was wondering whether she should... I've never touched make-up in my life.       P.S. If you want to, and for a better chance to earn 10 points, you can tell me how to break it to her parents (It gets weirder because of the lip balm for her dry lips...)

Is this feasible & has anyone done this before or if you're a hairdresser what would u suggest? Thanks for ur help!

20090202165139AAWSfLK	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Are you serious?? Cold sore help, pleaseee!?	So about 3 weeks ago I was attacked with 3 cold sores at once. Yea not 1, not 2, but 3.    I let it go too long until they had already grown. Then I decided, enough, and did home-treament. I took Lysine, a pill my doctor gave me, then put nail-polish remover and hydrogen peroxide on them. The remover and peroxide worked great, the blisters were scabbed overnight.      Ehm, anyways. Now I look in the mirror and guess what?!?! I have another little blister starting. I just ran and popped like 3 Lysine and started the perscription my doc gave me.   This time I want to get a head start. My boyfriend is coming to visit on the 13th, obviously for Valentine's day. It's crucial that it's gone by then.      I want to kill it BEFORE it gets bigger and "erupts". Er, forms that huge, nasty sore. How do I do that?   It's a tiny thing right now...no bigger than the jewel of an earring. So any suggestions on how to stop the blister from forming any bigger than it is, basically "stopping itself in its track", will be greatly appreciated.      I don't want to hear "you have to let it run it's course" because that's not entirely true, there are home rememdies and I would only like to hear those.      Oh and one more thing...is it possible for someone to harbor the Herpes simplex 1 virus and cause outbreaks on other people even if they don't get cold sores? I noticed that I hadn't had a cold sore in a while then after a weekend of lotssss of kissing my boyfriend, those three popped up. Now after Friday when he was here (we obviously kissed) I have another one. He hasn't ever had a cold sore but I'm starting to wonder if it's possible that he's whats causing my outbreaks? Heh it seems far-fetched but I'm just curious.      Thank you!   :)
