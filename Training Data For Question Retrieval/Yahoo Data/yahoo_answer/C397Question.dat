Whirlpool Washer   model number WFW8300SW      Whirlpool Dryer   model number WED8300SW      I have a friend that works at Best Buy and with his discount the total is about $1000 without tax. Both brands come out to be about the same price with a difference of only $35. So I was wanting to know if anyone had any opinions as to which set was better and more cost effeciant? Also, does anyone know of a place where you can purchase both the washer and the dryer in a set for cheaper?       Thanks for your help! :)

20090220095910AADYJlD	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Top level apartment has sound problem, bottom level does NOT?	I am desparate for some answers surrounding my current condo sound problem. No one seems to have answers, and the problem itself is somewhat bizarre and illogical.      I live in the second floor condo of a two story building.  We have a tremendous amount of noise transfer occurring from the neighbors below (who are very quiet, very nice people).  We can hear them having a normal conversation below us, we can hear their TV when its on very clearly, and most frustrating is we cannot even attempt to sleep through the impact noises caused by cupboards, drawers, sliding doors, and even stand alone furniture that opens/closes.  We can even feel vibrations through our couch (though slight) when their washer/dryer is in use.      The odd thing is that they NEVER hear anything from us.  Never hear our surround sound TV being blasted, never hear us clanging around with our cabinets, NEVER hear us talking.      It seems weird the the upstairs unit would have huge sound problems, but not the downstairs.  And I have been down there to test for noise between tenants...it is truly much more soundproofed.  How can it be that sound proofing is occurring from our unit down to theirs, but not from their unit up to ours?      Any thoughts?  Any suggestions on how we can mitigate the sound in our upstairs unit?      THANK YOU!

On four occasions - days apart - for whatever reason the furnace has refused to cycle on when the temp gets down to where it should. We don't notice it until someone of us says 'Hey, it's cold in here.' Wife pushes up the thermostat - no go. Circuit breaker looks good but I switch it off & on anyway - furnace came on, everything back to normal. After the second time I replaced the circuit breaker; I know they can go bad although not that often. Yesterday it did it again. This time we flipped the power switch mounted on the furnace itself off & on - furnace came on and stayed on until things warmed up & then it shut off normally. To me this means the circuit breaker & power switches are OK. What else can it be? The thermostat?This is a forced hot air gas furnace, and the furnace is the only appliance on the circuit breaker in question. Thanks in advance.

20061105104600AAHQBXn	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	A question for innovators?	I have 2 cabinet door panels, that are a hair to big for the door opening. I have already done some hinge adjustments but still to tight. I only need to take off about a 32nd. to a 16th. for a nice fit. I would rather sand that smidge off , but I want it even. Has anyone ever tried to make a backing pad for sanding that will fit on a table saw? If so what kind of material did you use. I was wondering about a 1/4 " x  8" plate made out of that real hard pressboard. Cutting , centering and truing the plate is np problem, but will it take the motor rpm? Need an answer fairly quick, would like to finish this project by next Friday 11-10-06. Thanks.
