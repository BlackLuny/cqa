mWOp3iZRaa	sure,   you should click on the bed and choose "Relax" and then when he/she is already relaxing on the bed you click on the partner and choose "ask to join" and when they are both relaxing on the bed you click on your partner and choose "try for a baby" not "woohoo" :)    I hope I helped     Happy simming and enjoy|`|AA11618876	Make both of them them go relax in the bed, and then select one of them and click on the other and pick try for baby.|`|SuGFYsnBaa	i think there are special beds for that like valentines bed that help out in that....    and im pretty sure there is an option in double or bigger beds that say "play" and u click it    and thats what u gotta do to get one, it might take several tries though|`|fvwLFWqwaa	eww|`|fna0OfuCaa	in bed you need to have them both lay down and relax and then click one of them and click cuddle then once they are cuddling click again and woohoo should come up and so should try for baby... same goes for in a car or hot tub|`|gIzJaGTZaa	get one to relax on the bed, then have he/she call the over over. after a few seconds, if one of them doesnt get up, several options will appear including woohoo and cuddle.   it works best if you get them both really tired  in the ps2 version, im pretty sure that u cant have babies  in the computer version u can though|`|1lOTFK9Faa	You have to get the husband to get a job at the fertility clinic. He will then after 2 months bring a baby home from work. I would say the wife but there intelligence level cannot be raised high enough.|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	If you want them to have a baby, click on the man, click on a double bed and choose "Relax."  Then click on the woman and choose "Relax."  When they are both in the bed, click on either one of them and choose Try for a Baby.  If you hear a lullaby play afterwards, then she is pregnant.  If not, keep trying!|`|3eI0UFDiaa	make them both relax in bed. than make one talk to the other and the option will be to woohoo in bed or kiss makeout or something else. make sure they are not too tired, they have good health and all the above and you will make the sim get pregnant. they have to be one girl and one guy not two girls or two guys.|`|BfbjdCnUaa	well make one relax in bed and then click an the other one and click ask to join and then once relaxing in bed together click on the other one and try for baby woohooing wont make a baby and, if you hear music your gonna have a baby!!|`|h3LXI1Wvaa	first, have them both relax in the bed. then, once you've selected a sim, click on him/her, and options will show up. typically they have to cuddle first. and from there, do what you want.|`|UE0mKPSUaa	Easy. Go to the bed and click it then click relax (sometimes it doesnt work, depending on the mood) The ounce they are both in the bed click the bed again and click woohoo. But if you want them to have a baby, then you have to click try for baby instead of woohoo.|`|BNZYsPtgaa	im not sure... but you must like too woohoo people huh?|`|ZGMNIUw7aa	click the bed and press relax for both of the sims.  once they are both laying there click one of the other sims and  it should say try for baby.  hope that helps !
TWDTlY5naa	well i personally think you should wait for sims 3! it comes out this month. (really soon by the way!) and it sounds great you get to pick your sims personalities and everything it will be so much better than sims 2. so i think you should save Your money for that.|`|AoDwbpTxaa	Theres a bunch:  Sims 2 Pets (awesome, you get to do stuff with pets, my fave)  Sims 2 Bon Voyage (traveling stuff)  Sims 2 Double Deluxe (i think you already have the 2 it gives you?)  Sims 2 Freetime (Sports)    Pick which one you like the best! Also, remember that you can always download free stuff like characters, custom furniture, and houses on the website http://thesims2.ea.com/ . People make custom characters with sims body shop, and make a whole bunch of famous people. For example, you can download for free a character that looks just like angelina jolie, and a brad pitt, and make them marry each other.    Also, if you want, you can just save your money for sims 3 which is coming out in a month or so.    Good Luck, and have fun!!|`|07ebc6c7caa06199656ee0036a46cc16aa	Ah always so tricky to pick out just one pack.      Ok some thoughts that may help.      Uni - Love the Arcade cabinets :D has other nice items.  Great way to get your Sims skills up especially if you have a storyline or career in mind for them.  Fun social interactions.    Can feel like a bit of a slog sometimes if you tend to switch between families a lot but if you like to stick with a couple of sims for a session or two then it won't bother you.    I like it.      Pets - I'm one of the people who enjoyed pets.  It doesn't feel like it adds as much game play as say Open for Business but having mad cat ladies and a dog for the kids is cute and just fits in there great like the weather does with Seasons.      Bon Voyage.  Number one reason to buy this game.  Beach lots.  Nuff said.  lol      Freetime adds more depth to your sims, it's fun to see them want to do more than just watch tv.  Adds some nice clutter items too.      Have fun playing with your new expansion whichever one you choose.|`|zSo7fvGKaa	if i were you  i would just not buy one  and save your money for sims 3 coming out in a month!  thats what i want to do anyway :)
m1F9LdfXaa	It would be awesome, however I think all of us fans will then want it to be re-released on the next console as well lol! But we still have a lot to come from the Final Fantasy 7 franchise as I believe they announced that it was going to be a long project... So maybe, just maybe ;)     I'm not sure they should do any more character side games, but Red would be up next methinks, oh and did you check out the beat em up Ergheiz on the ps1? That had Cloud, Tifa, Sephiroth in and Yuffie I think :)|`|4El5rPbyaa	As far as i know i think they are re-releasing ff7 on ps3.  My brother told me about it, so if they do... i can't wait! ITS GOING TO BE AWESOME!|`|AoDwbpTxaa	Uh, Tifa? Sephiroth? The original final fantasy 7 is already on Cloud. Maybe even Cid lol.|`|gKEbUVtfaa	I totally think they should remaster the whole game, not really change much or anything, and release to to there chosen consoles, Would be a huge hit.|`|ZAFPfG3vaa	Yes, I think Square Enix should go much farther into the storyline of FFVII, considering it is the most popular FF yet. I hope they go for even another Cloud one!|`|PEGZmw73aa	Yeah, their should be an ff7 remake.    Who knows, their probably WILL be one day soon.  Tetsuya Noruma said untill 2017, the ff7 compilatiion wouldn't die.    So we very well may see one.    Cross your fingers :D|`|s385zhsHaa	FF7 being rereleased would be pretty cool to see.  Not to mention it would make a lot of money, it's an enormous fanbase.    But something to think about; FF7 was such a great game in everyway.  Would you really want to change it?  I kinda think I would prefer the little blocky characters with black squares for hands than something looking completely realistic.  It might take away some of that nostalgia.  Also, I like the PSX powered music.  That soundtrack is amazing.  I don't want it redone with something like the Baltic Philharmonic Symphony in 7.1 Dolby Digital.    It would be cool.  But, even if it did come out, I think I would like the original version the best.  Kinda like New Coke.
RrE8uvOoaa	Most likely someone has it up on torrents.
AoDwbpTxaa	I think in the options you can change the resolution, make it the biggest possible and that should help. Search around in the options, but it should be automatically full screen, odd.
SuGFYsnBaa	360 i would choose bc its cheaper, and everyone has it.  But its abit useless, well loses its touch without live so thats a necesity.      Ps3 has great graphics and the blu-ray is a plus but there arent too many games and at its price i question if its worth it    Wii is cheap and cool at first, but they are abit short on games, i dont know ur age but to me i quickly got bored, and the internet is pretty bad with friend codes etc|`|nKfZ4lCdaa	Wii|`|AoDwbpTxaa	PS3. Definately, it has WAY more capabilities that both Wii and Xbox.|`|9FlCQQXnaa	I love my Playstation 3 ( It was my first next gen console ) but I would have to go with my xBox 360. It just has more games and better online.|`|AkUJPsUGaa	I got a Wii, but I kind of regret it now. The ability to build Miis and the free online is pretty nifty, but the 360 has much better games.    I would say 360.|`|HA8Ehs3Gaa	I have a wii which is fun but right now they are having problems getting out good games.|`|Zf3p43y9aa	360
MhQn9yq1aa	Silent Hill 2 is THE best game in the series. If you have to play one play that one.    1) I can't tell you specifics as that would ruin the game but I can tell some some rough basics: Silent Hill is a deserted town that is sealed off with fences because apparently something bad happened there. Most people that go to the town go there by accident.     2)It may be weird playing with a keyboard but not impossible or annoying. Of course, I recommend using a gamepad (with rumble capabilties if available).    3) If I tell u the plot the game will be ruined (silent hill games are like mystery horror, the story drives the game, not just killing all the monsters like resident evil). Besides, the games don't follow each other directly, they're more like final fantasy where each story is unique and different, except in silent hill they all take place in the same place    4) In Silent Hill 2, the main character is drawn to the town because he recieves a letter from his wife who had died 3 years earlier saying to visit her in their "special place".    5) Silent Hill 2 IS scary (because it uses psychological tactics to scare you, not some cheap "monster jumping out of the closet" scares), so is 1 and 3, after 4 not as much.    Also one that makes the first games scarier is that you're just a normal person, you're not a skilled sniper or soldier so ur fighting skills arent that good, in fact they suck, so at first its better to attack close and when your character starts getting used to weapons you can attack from a safer distance.    6. Silent Hill 2 is a MUST; its my fav.     7. The new Silent Hill games (Origins, Homecoming) just aren't the same.    8.The new ones are easier (trust me, easier doesn't make it more fun)    9.1, 2 (In silent hill 2 at least one puzzle may annoy you but once you pass it you'll feel good)    10. you already asked that one as number 8.    Yes 2, 3, 4: The Room, Homecoming are for PC      Maybe other people may give you their suggestions, but as a hardcore gamer and a die-hard Silent Hill fanatic (because Silent Hill kills games like resident evil and fatal frame when it comes to creepy factor), i can promise you that what I'm telling you here is to be trusted.    Oh yeah and Silent Hill 2 is much scarier when you play alone with no other people around talking, and in the dark.      Vote for my answer!|`|AoDwbpTxaa	I can only answer some.    1) They have different storylines, with different people. I think all of them have the same girl, which is like a devil-child kinda girl, really creepy. She's possessed and has demonic powers.  2)I don't think it's hard to play on the comp.  3)They are zombies, or demons, like devil-spawn kinda things.  4)The girl has summoned them with her possed-demonic-powers.  5)I sh** in my pants atleast 25 times. That's all I have to say. Except for the latest one that just came out, it kinda sucked.  6)Silent Hill 3 was in my opinion the scariest, and because of that, my favorite.    Actually, I don't think they even make it for comp lol, just ps2.|`|pyl4rTEzaa	Niiiiiice     Look anyone will probably refuse to take the time out an explain to you the unbelievable, in-depth story line of the games. But... to answer some of your questions..    1)  Looong story short... Religion buffs. Rituals. Revenge.  2) They are just as awkward with controls on systems, so your straight.  3) The monsters are manifestations of the main characters mind.                   (THEY  ARE REAL THOUGH!)  4) I assume your asking why are the main characters in Silent Hill? Everyone has their own reason for going, or ending up, in the place. Each story is different, but you learn it.    5) These games are the only games in the Physiological horror genre. So rare, that they don't get labeled as that in mainstream categorizations. So yeah, its a different type of fear. Not no Resident Evil fear; where something jumps out, or you moaning from behind the door.  This game will have a bloody room your in seem like a safe haven compared to whats outside your field of vision.    6) My favorite is of course... Silent Hill 2 You don't need to know the whole story line to enjoy it. You can start on SH2 and love it as much if not more, than if you played the series in order.    7)Least favorite is probably... damn that's a hard one. I guess Silent Hill 4 for personal reasons.    8) Easiest? All are easy on "Easy" all are hard as hell on "Hard". sorry-    9) I guess 4, is the hardest to me. Maybe that's the only one I played fully on PC? Don't know..    10) This reminds me of that time I answered number 8.    --------------   Play number 2 a couple times. Understand that everything, from the way a corpse is positioned to the windows that are opened/cracked, all hold meaning. Not puzzle solving meaning, but a more, deeper meaning. This game in particular is VERY abstract and well thought out..

NfsGPniJaa	Stop playing retarded korean FPS games, and most of the other korean sh!t is bullsh!t. That includes, Maple Sh!t (Maple Story), ***** Farms (Combat Arms), Soldier Sh!t (Soldier Front), War C0ck(War Rock), and Gayz (Gunz). All korean games have a retarded name, and you need to STAY THE F*CK AWAY FROM THEM. PLAY CALL OF DUTY 4 INSTEAD, UNLESS YOU'RE A QUEEF.
hXOqWnkJaa	Halo 3, Left 4 Dead.|`|qe1Ncf7Yaa	skate has 4 player, its a fun game too, u can either play S.K.A.T.E or own the spot, ( two muliplayer games)|`|6GIrW5eWaa	Halo 3 is a four player game with splitscreen, COD (5) WAW is also split screen but not online only local.
4qpA27dTaa	Okay, so:  1) 4 Leaf Clovers do count as weeds, but they also double as lucky items if you place them in your house (they appear as a book with the 4 Leaf Clover on top), which will score you HRA points.    2) The spiritual cleansing done by Katrina (which costs 10,000 bells)reverses a falling spell (which you can get after doing the compatibility test, if she believes the 2 of you are not meant to be).    3) It's pretty unusual for any neighbors to pack their boxes right away, but I believe that it should take about a day or 2 after you continuously make them angry. (I am not exactly for certain on this.)    4) I am sorry to say that in order to earn a perfect town rating, you must place 16 squares across(of any patterning)x 16 squares down over your entire town and plant, for the absolute perfect town, 15 trees and 3 flowers exactly in each acre. (You then have to keep your town down to the max of 3 weeds per acre, absolutely nothing on the ground besides plants and trees, including items, clothing, and trash, for 16 days straight. You also have to spend a few days buying all the flower seeds and tree saplings from Tom Nook and lay down all the proper patterned squares on the ground before you can start the whole process. This is quickest and easiest when following the instructions of animalxing.com, as they have just about the best perfect town rating guide for Animal Crossing: Wild World.)    5) I'm guessing, that after you talk to Sable continuously for a few days at least, she will start to open up to you. (I am not exactly for certain on this one, either.) My best advice is this: just talk to Sable every day until she starts talking to you.    I hope this helped, and if you need to know more, I recommend buying The Official Animal Crossing: Wild World Guide or going to animalxing.com.|`|qe1Ncf7Yaa	1. Yes they do  2. Pretty sure it does nothing, to be absolutely sure check gamefaqs.com  3. About a few days to a week if u hit them enough  4. Can't do it quick (unfortunetly) :( have to do it the longer way  5. i took me I think about 1 1/2 to 2 weeks, just talk to her every day|`|TtPoXArjaa	1.  Yes, but they are lucky so you get HRA points if you put them in your house.  2. It gets rid of the "bad luck," but if you wait until the next day, the bad luck will go away on its own.

Pick it up, it's definately worth it! you'll have a ball and enjoy interacting with others!|`|a71t2nW9aa	World of Warcraft and age of conan|`|CLBDYIitaa	Depends on your style of gaming. Best thing to do is to figure out your style of gaming. Genre (FPS, RTS, MMO, etc.) Then figure out how indepth you want the game to be.     For a more simple MMO, then play WoW, for something more complex then play Vanguard SoH or something of that nature.     For a RTS. Depends if you like squad based RTS's (Company of Heores, Dawn of War, etc.. ) or the Individual unit control (Starcraft or Supreme Commander)    For FPS. If you like fast paced shooters then i suggest CoD4. Its as realistic as any FPS will get for a while. Great physics and runs on a good engine. CoD5 Came out not long ago, thats a little more squad based. And has more interface features.  BF2142 is a Large scale FPS. Its probably the most stable large scale FPS. Very squad based. In fact, its encouraged from the variety of Squad Leader unlocks.  The vehicles are very balanced too.    Because alot of people play World Of Warcraft doesnt make it good. Just has alot of lore fans and the developers know how to make a game addicting.

JuRtPdiVaa	Ok, well I'm 10th Prestige level 55...yeah used to play a lot.  Some tips:  Use the M21. Most accurate out of all snipers, and best.  If your playing hardcore search/team than used UAV jammer, if your playing regular use Stopping Power.  Use Claymores as first perk. Plant them near doors or entries to your sniping spot.  For third perk DEFINITELY used Iron Lungs.  As your pistol, used Desert Eagle for sure.    As for spots, don't go anywhere too common where other players look to kill you. Try to find your own places, where people won't know to look as much.    Hope that helped.  :D
JuRtPdiVaa	This game is amazing!  Dynasty/Franchise mode is pretty much the same as it is every year, but of course with some upgrades.  Superstar mode is even better than before, adding in some key updates.    And yes, if you have a NCAA 09 superstar you can transport it into your Madden 09 and play with your superstar in the NFL.    Hope that helps....   :D|`|TY96YpbZaa	The best one so far.    8.8/10 :]

Extract it if needed, then in the emulator click file, open rom.    Find where you extracted the file and double click it.    Now, it should be playing.    Have funnn!
hXOqWnkJaa	Yeah, this happen to me. Phone Microsoft and see if you can get it fixed. If not there another solution. You'll have to install it into your hard drive. Which will need 10 GB of Memory.. But if you don't have a 120 GB, it might be a problem. Since you'll have to install all of your games into your hard drive or you'll lag out everytime.|`|dyvzXArkaa	i would think that it would be the opposite and kick you out when you play the heoric maps which you save on ur hard drive     Try checking ur connection  thats all i can think of    maybe uve been banned?|`|gKEbUVtfaa	It could be your hard drive not being able to load it cause its corrupt or your xbox having trouble loading the selected content. Same thing happened to me, try a new halo 3 disk then tell us what happens.
vY48XnUpaa	'do i need one of those R4 revolutions for the ds, or can i use a regular like 2gb scan disk??'    Both different things. R4 is a flashcard and the other one acts as a memory. You'll need both though. There are many flashcards around such as R4, DSTT, Cyclods, M3 etc etc. You put the games in the microsd card then afterwards you put that into the flashcard. How? There is a slot for it :)    I suggest not buying a R4 due to a lack of firmware updates, which means you may not be able to play new games. Alternatives, M3, EDGE.

AA10008572	There maybe a reason. The economy really started crashing about months ago and Warcraft is not a necessity. They may have had they're hour cut or not working over time like they use too. What's more important? A house and food on table or Warcraft. They may have to do it because their back is to the wall. Another reason: how's your grades? Are you spending so much time online that you no longer go outside or do other activities? You need to take a hard look at yourself and what's happening around you. You will need to calmly have a meeting with your parents to find out what's up and is there any compromise ie chores you can do.

BQYAN8SCaa	I just got it as well.  I hated the controls tried to switch them around but it was the same ****.  This was a huge disappointment for me as I thought this game would be great.    Like stated above Left 4 Dead is the same but the guys are like jelly and run fast (opposite)    If you don't have a 360 because as you said you tried RS5 on PS3 than get it on the PC.    I have had it for 1 week now and it is really fun especially online where you can even be the infected and attack the humans.    However if your PC isn't great and you are not sure if you can handel it check this...    www.canyourunit.com    If it can not handel it than don't worry Killzone 2 is just around the corner     Here is a video of Killzone 2 http://www.gametrailers.com/player/44970...|`|r60WMB6paa	Thats why you just play left4dead to do that resident evil 5 is garbage i agree i played the demo|`|k7H9ZUILaa	damn that must really suk  i was gonna buy it man  but if its wat u say it is den fk dat  lol  thanx for tellin us dis|`|jaS4TwClaa	hell yea. its ******* GAY  GO GET   STREET FIGHTER IV

I do believe that as you progress in your relationship, they will want to go to other places. To check progress, one could check it in the stats menu of the game. Just click start, then stats, then find the appropriate sub-heading and find it.

Xaffu60Waa	When you install Halo Custom Edition, you don't patch your existing Halo Combat Evolved installation. You download Halo Custom Edition and install it as a separate game, almost. Each has its own directory and files and each has its own updater. The Halo Custom Edition Installer is almost two hundred megabytes, and takes a while to download. You must have a valid Halo Combat Evolved CD key in order to install Halo Custom Edition.     You can download Halo Custom Edition Here:  http://hce.halomaps.org/index.cfm?fid=41...    You can also get all the custom map files you want from that same website, www.halomaps.org Just put the map files in the maps directory and restart Halo Custom Edition to play them.

HF19QRo8aa	A few of my recommendations for the Wii are:  1)  Mario Kart Wii $49.99  2)  The Conduit $49.99 (not out yet, but I think it will be worth the wait!  3)  Animal Crossing City Folk $49.99  4)Medal of Honor Heroes 2 $29.99  (GREAT shooter that uses the zapper from the Link shooting game)     Those are a few ideas, also I'd consider saving up and getting a Nintendo DSI when it comes out (April Maybe).  It's estimated to be around $180.00 and be a great hand held system with music, camera, internet, and great games.|`|tOzcWE8Eaa	if u have x360 get halo 3 best game ever, its so fun playing it i even play 5 hours straight!!it costs 60 $ i think

You should spend at least 10-15 mins stretching before running. Pay special attention to the area's that are cramping up, stretching them before and after running.  There are several ways to increase your time in running. Make sure your using the full length of your stride. The longer the stride the shorter the run. Keep your head up, your tongue down, and your arms moving. You'll be surprised how much more air you can move through your mouth when your tongue isn't in the middle of it. Keeping your head up makes for a 'fluid' airway and reduces the stress on your neck. Don't forget to use your arms, to often runners clinch their fists or throw thier arms in front of the torsal impeding forward progress. Keep your palms flat and your arms parralell to your body. If you focus on a good solid running form your times in the mile will plummet down.|`|e7ce294a530f50429530ed8b167e59f3aa	you just have to pace yourself.  Start off with a slow pace and you get in better shape just step up that pace a little bit each time.   Go at your own pace and whe you get on the fourth lap if you got something left, take a bigger stride and finish strong.|`|AA11689215	Run outside.  A treadmill is pretty useless.    But if you HAVE to use a treadmill, increase your incline.|`|aec9b9fb776540fd61637e68224024baaa	if you have knee joint problems, see your doctor  otherwise, any type of stretching at all is good for you, put your leg on a bar and reach forward, trying to bring your foot to your forehead etc. any stretch will increase the mobility of your leg. also, try moving into a splits postition, this will loosen up your hips, extending your stride    for endurance and geting rid of those cramps, try sprints, where your run as fast as you can for as long as you can. do a few repititions of these everyday, and your speed and endurance will increase. the longer you go, the better.    if you don't like sprinting, you can simply jog for long distances, on soft ground (avoid concrete or other heavy impact surfaces that are bad for your joints) and in an interesting environment. try to vary it so that you don't get as bored as you run. also, following one of the other people's answers about pacing yourself is highly recommended    drink water and warm up before any physical activity.
31f7bb9f7a2a5b336c2aa4674ad79d16aa	I play roleplaying game Neverwinter Nights, multiplayer, which uses 3rd edition D&D rules. I'm especially obsessed with one server called "Mike's Battle of the Dragons," a team game in which you have to fight monsters and players belonging to the other team, and eventually, when you lvl up high enough, you can take on the enemy dragon, and whichever team kills the enemy's dragon wins. If you want to play D&D against other players, I suggest buying Neverwinter Nights and the expansions Hordes of the Underdark and Shadows of Undertide.      ENJOY!!!

cd0f5542a3c1d306dbf80884b812df23aa	Mine overheated, the game I was playing just froze.  Not knowing the reason I assumed it had just crashed and tried to reset it to no avail.  I left it switched off for about 10 minutes and turned it on again and everything worked fine for about an hour until it got hot again.  Eventually I just moved the xbox off the carpet and closer to a drafty window and haven't had any problems since.  It's up to you as to whether you get a fan or not but I'd think about the noise any fan will make as lets face it the 360 is already loud enough without an extra fan spinning away in your living room.|`|7ce7cbce566d01b6e291f154c043626eaa	yes overheating is very bad and can destroy your system, and i heard that it plagues xbox 360s round the world.  as a quick fix id say just open it and point a fan at it. But I don't know if there are fans sold for it, there should be a fan built in. go on a xbox website and see if they have fans for it.|`|b032fb039813a98652a4d946eac5bcdfaa	that would cool it off|`|b81e1b1ed0d83c85da2da248d1f01b78aa	360??  dude i need info here|`|92a5d180da3a67afa485c8c161fbd739aa	I've never really heard of a 360 overheating. Yes they get really hot, but then they just start freezing up, and someone turns them off. I've played for atleast 18 hours and all it does is freeze up and get hot and we just turn it off for 30 mins. and get back on.    I don't really advise getting intercoolers or anything like that because they actually make your 360 hotter, and can cause burning inside the 360, etc. It's blowing air into the 360.    I don't use anything, I just leave it out in an open area. Let it have air get to it instead of confining to anything. All of my friends do the same thing, they don't put it in an entertainment center or anything.    Edit-Lol, yes they have fans in 360s! They have fans in all consoles. Just like pc's do. DUH! It's just that they didn't put enough in them, and the system gets too hot. The same thing happens to pc's. But do not open your 360 at any time, that void's warranty!|`|81bbcf69635f3a64ed058e81efbb71ebaa	isnt there a coolant for the xbox 360 that u can attach to the back!  use it

NWN 2 is liner so you will get interested and can keep playing for 10 hours but then you'll finish it in a week.   personally I like NWN 2 more and I use Oblivion like a small game to kill time some thing like windows's pinball!|`|xmA7RApjaa	Oblivion is much better than Morrowind, I find that it rocks on the 360, but be open to the pc version, you can download mods from gamespot.com

UsojaTuuaa	well if i was close to the mom ( like my best friends mom ) if she wanted a scrapbook i would just make it. but im older and you might not have that kind of money so i would just charge her the amount for the stuff. maybe you can go get it and she can reinburse you...  i wouldnt charge her extra. just be nice and dont charge her for doing it.|`|Vhq3GURQaa	Without taking into account the supplies, consider charging by the hour. That way, you both know how much time is invested. You can tell her the per hour  price and ask how detailed or how many hours she was thinking.|`|BJugETlOaa	Depending on how close you are with her I would say like $50 Not including supplies I would think that it wouldn't be a huge scrapbook if it is I would charge more.|`|6pUFu5qxaa	20$|`|vMXk9ohSaa	Apparently you've done scrapbooks before since she seems to think you would do a good job on this one.  How long does it take you to finish one?  Including the time you go shopping and get your stuff together?  Add up the cost of all the materials.  (If you use something you already owned, estimate how much that piece cost you to add it up, too.)  Now add in how much to charge per hour of your time you think you will be working on it.  At least $5.00 an hour - more likely $10.00 an hour if you're that good.  If the end result seems like too much, then charge her cost of materials plus $20.00.
9CLRMnhSaa	Sorry!  I don't know but go on the sims website!|`|Dso7k3sjaa	Well, I would try to help you with your installing question, but I don't honestly know what it is.    After you do get it installed though, you click on the icon that gets put onto your desktop when it's installing the game.  Then it will load the game.  When it finally stops at a screen where you can pick which neighborhood you want to play in, either pick one of them (which will make that neighborhood load up) or click on the little blocks.  The little blocks are a short tutorial that will answer a lot of your questions.    Anyway, if you do decide to just go into one of the neighborhoods, after you do, you will see that some of the houses have a green plumbbob over them.  The houses with plumbbobs are ones that have "pre-made" sims in them that you can play.  To play any of them, pick one and click on that lot.  It will load that lot up and you will see pictures of the sims living in the lot on the left side of your screen.    If you click on a picture, it will take you to where that sim is.  You get your sim to do things by clicking on them.  But if the house has 2 sims, you have to first click on the sim that you want to make do something.  Then, once you are "controlling" that sim, then you can click on something else -- like the toilet and choose to have them "Use" it or the fridge and choose to have them Make Breakfast, etc.    If the phone is ringing, normally the sim will just automatically answer it, but if they don't, then you click on the phone while it's ringing and you'll see the option to Answer, then just click on that option.    It's best if you use the tutorial that you can do by clicking on the blocks because until you actually play it, it can be difficult to describe what to do. Most of it will be easy once you can try it for yourself.

Dark Emperor Structure Decks are really good (get 2 copies for 20.00) and you can counter with your Helios or Gren Maju Da Eiza.

For the water deck you might you might want to get somthing that destroys spells and traps. It would probably help with the zombie deck also.|`|u3ro3vAsaa	well that all depends how much money you wanna spend. Some decks like tele-dads are over 1000$, which is one of the best decks, but a simple structure deck like dark emperor,(around 10$ each) can wreck havoc on it with a few touch ups. From what ive seen and faced, gladiator beasts are the most flexible, and can be versatile in terms of going against other decks. And lastly, there is a kind of deck called the "meta-deck" which can potentially destroy all top tier decks, yet cant really do much on a random deck.|`|WlxWPMK7aa	do you mean different dimension deck?  its good. but not that good.  try light and dark deck.

zZ3BmCXoaa	Copied and Pasted from the FAQ in the link:    --------------------------------------...  2. Meeting WISP the Ghost  --------------------------------------...    Wisp the Ghost is one of the special visitors that will come in your town.  I would assimilate him mostly with Gulliver, because his appearance is   conditioned by a small warning event (like Gulliver's space ship crossing in   the sky in AC: WW). Also you need to retrieve an item for him in order to   receive a gift.    He comes on a RANDOM day in the week and never twice the same week. I had him   twice on a Monday, once on a Thursday, and once on a Wednesday.   He will be the only special visitor in your town that day, so if you had   another visitor in your town that day, do not bother looking for him at night.  His arrival will be announced by you finding an item in your town: The Empty   Lamp.  This item has the same type of program as the ship parts that you have to find   for Gulliver. This means that it will have about the same size (slightly   bigger than a bunch of white turnips), gold colour, and looking identical to   the Genie Lamp from Aladdin (Arabian Nights). In your inventory, the lamp will   have a "lamp" icon, not the classical green leaf for furniture.     You will find the lamp laying on the ground around your town. The locations   are random, but generally it will appear next to one of the main buildings or   shops.  You will NOT have to dig the ground or shake trees. It will just sit there for   you to pick, and the spot is always quite visible.    You can take the lamp in your house, and use it as decoration, but you cannot   "grab" it, "turn" it, or change its place otherwise than picking it up and   dropping it in a different spot. Also, if it's on the floor of your house, you   can walk through it.    So, once you found the lamp, you will know that Wisp will visit your town that   night. He comes after 8.00 pm, and you will find him in the South area of the   town.  Some people said South-East, but this is incorrect. He can be anywhere along   the sea-shore. You will not see him at first, but "hear a voice" instead.   Well, actually you will have a dialogue box open spontaneously while walking   along the shore. The "voice" will ask you to "come closer" so make a few steps   north, until you "hear the voice" again. Immediately after Wisp will   materialize, and you need to go and talk to him.  Wisp will ask you to find his lamp (exactly like Gulliver with the ship parts)   so if you have the lamp with you, just talk to him again.  He will then tell you that he will grant you an wish, and invite you to join   him in your attic, then he will disappear. You DO NOT have to wait midnight to   go.      Go to your attic, open your inventory and click on the lamp icon. Choose "rub"   from the menu, and Wisp will materialize again.  He will then ask you to choose between:  1. De-weed the town  2. Smash Roaches  3. Give me stuff  4. Never mind.    If you choose option 3, you will then be able to choose between:  1. Furniture  2. Clothes  3. Hats  4. Accessories  5. Nothing    From what I noticed, the item he gives you if you choose "furniture" will be a   rather rare piece, not one of the rarest nor specific to him in any way. I got   a Lefty Desk, Samurai Suite, Lucky Frog, and Bow and Arrows. So I guess that   he mainly gives rare items that you can also find at Spotlight sale at Nook's.  You cannot get carpets or walls from him.    WISP WILL NOT APPEAR THE NEXT DAY AFTER YOU FOUND THE LAMP. If you did not   find him that day, you will need to wait until next time that you find another   Empty Lamp in your town. He is a one day visitor, and buying the lamp from   someone else will not make him appear in your town either. You have to find   the lamp in your OWN town, and you will be able to find him just on that   night.  The Empty Lamp has no value (as Gulliver's ship parts had no value), you   cannot sell it at Nook's. Nook will only offer to "take it off your hands"   like he does with pitfall seeds or garbage. So don't let yourself tricked by   people who offer a Lamp for sale. It's useless, unless you want to keep it as   crappy decoration that it is.  ======================================...

f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	get an ear of sweetcorn and strip the corn husks off it and the silk, gently, let it all dry a few days or overnight in an oven with just the pilot light. take a round bead the size you want for the head and take your longest cornhusks you might like to put wire in the bead hole to help make a skeleton for the body but you dont have to, i think a 12mm bead would be a good size, we always used plain wooden ones, make sure the wire wont poke out the top hole of the bead, then cover the bead with the cornhusks, folding the husk over the bead making the husks fold in half lengthwise, you will want to use a couple of good sized husks, then with heavy thread tie a knot under the bead which creates the neck of the doll, try not to get odd points on the sides of the husk but keep it as smoothly rounded to the bead as you can. then take a piece of wire or pipe cleaner, also called chennile stems in the craft department, fold a small end creating a hand, it will just be an oval loop about a quarter of an inch long. take a nice corn husk and using the end that was at the stem of the corn, and has a natural sort of curl to it, place that near the hand, with the rest of the husk extending down over the hand. and wrap with strong thread above the hand, then gently fold the husk back over the tied area, and wrap and tie it near the more pointed end of the wire or chennile stem. you want the wire to be about 6 inches or less at this point. now do the exact same thing for the other arm, now below the dolls neck insert an arm between the halves of the body, now bend the wire of the upper part of the dolls arm inward to  hide it inside the dolls body and strenthen the upper body, do the same with the other arm, now below the arms tie off the body of the doll  with heavy thread creating the waist. if you are making a male doll, make the legs just as you did the arms only a bit longer and make the folded end of the chennile stem about half an inch or more long, so the feet are a little more substantial, then you run the legs up into the body area just below the waist, an cut off any excess wire in the crotch area, then wrap a bit of the body husks through the crotch area and up the back, tying the body more strongly at the waist area, there is your gent, if you are making a lady, you dont need to do legs at all, you simply make more husks going around the lower part of the body, tie them at the waist with the lower parts of the husks pointed up over her head. when you have the skirt as full as you like then bend it back down over the lower part of the body, and tie off at the waist again, you can do this with a small square of printed fabric at the front waist to represent an apron, now you can arrange the corn silk for hair and glue on with elmers glue, when dry you can then use sharpie markers to make a face if you wish or keep it as the amish would , no face on it., if you are really talented you could even make the lady a bonnet. Im sure you can find lots of books in libraries that show it, and likely lots of spots on line. we made these by the dozens when i went to an international girl scout event back in the stone age.|`|ElnPlrptaa	You can find out how (instructions and all) in the book below.|`|40947c53900ba8c2ca9c27de9533b0b8aa	My source link provides the full instructions;While pipe cleaners aren't quite apt in their use, they're an accurate substitution for the purposes of safety.

B2KHmACoaa	I use "un-du adhesive remover".  I bought it at my local scrapbooking store.  It's a great item to have in  your scrapbooking supplies because you can safely remove and reuse stickers, tape,photo squares, ect..    Otherwise, "Goo Gone" is a great universal product that removes stickers, gum, tar, lipstick----all kinds of things.  That would work too.|`|AA11394722	Try a little rubbing alcohol swab or pad. It usually takes gummy stuff off. Maybe dip a Q Tip in rubbing alcohol and use that to get into the small places too.
w2xsd28Qaa	first see if you can re-install the game without uninstalling it.  a lot of programs have a "repair" option that will show up.  if that doesnt work, go into your C:\ drive and copy or cut your saved Sims data somewhere else, then reinstall it, and paste it back.|`|edoQsfyAaa	Find the folder with all your people/houses in it and copy it when you reinstall.  That worked on Sims 1 anyway.|`|xUwh5REGaa	There is not really a way to "repair" as such.  When problems like that happens and before you can even load the game I think it is best  to re-install and install each patch after each ep too.      To save your game, just save your sims2 folder but when you reinstall before you put back your sims2 folder try it so to make sure it has nothing to do with your game.      If you dont have seasons, you can use Simpe utility to back up your game which is great and easy to do rather than moving the whole folder but it will not back your collections files, lots catalog and downloads, so those 3 folders you might want to copy them.
w2xsd28Qaa	you can drink potions that say "restore" a stat, not fortify, or you can go to one of the churches in a town and click on the main altar and you will be cured.|`|ByejhbxMaa	Open your inventory then click on the far left tab Then onto the one that has your strength and stuff it will be red if it is damaged. or if it is a spell effect clcik on the spell tab and go to active spells it will show there.
AA10022566	Red water, walls or floors always mean one thing - you need to upgrade your video card.  Check at your card manufacturer's website to see if there are any new driver updates for you to download.  If not, you'll have to pony up for a new card.|`|xUwh5REGaa	You need to update/upgrade your graphic card but cleaning and do a defrag might help too if it is only a few things turning red.
AA10022566	Have the sim with the best charisma chat up the headmaster.  Schmooze him, if the option is available (I believe it is under Talk).  Give him a tour of the house- but he'll only grade you on the first three rooms, so make sure to take him to those with the highest environment scores (completely clean rooms with nice furniture & art.  He likes it when you have furniture that aids in skill points, too, like the chess table, musical instruments, easel, bookshelves, etc).  Have your sim with the highest cooking skill make the best dinner they can.  The HM really likes espresso and going in the hot tub.  Any unfinished homework, unpaid bills, old newspapers, puddles, untrimmed bushes and dirty surfaces will detract from your score.|`|303b890c37a07b8865dca664b9e3a900aa	Invite him over for dinner [use the phone, call Sim., headmaster].  Then make sure you talk to him alot/compliment/tell jokes, whatever it takes.|`|sZakb0yTaa	uhmm.. You have to give him a tour of you house esp. each room with high environment... Cook something and call him for dinner.. Talk to him... Thats all..^^|`|QrMUMnksaa	I absolutely love explaining this. It's my one passion.    Ready? You're going to be in for some serious cheating, here.    First, enter the following cheat using the box that is activated with ctrl+shift+c:  boolProp testingCheatsEnabled true    Make sure the cheat is exactly like this one.    Then, when the headmaster comes over, have the child sim schmooze with him and give him a tour of the house. If you're short on cash, you can always enter the "motherlode" cheat and buy some artwork. Get the most expensive artwork and place it in that room. If you don't want to use the money cheat, just move all your artwork to every room you show him.    While the tour is going on, drag someone's cooking skills to the max(you can do this with the boolprop cheat). Then, hold shift on your refridgerator and click "stock."     After these steps are completed, have your sim make lobster theirmedor, and then have them schmooze with the adult. If it's a lady, flirt if you must. Just make sure Daddy sims isn't around.
jM8AR8iHaa	The best way is to get some rope, climb a latter up a tree and tie the rope around a tree branch, the come back down the latter and tie the tire to the rope.|`|9hmAiAw2aa	From a branch on a tree?|`|AA10951360	With a fat rope, from a sturdy tree limb.    The higher the sturdy tree limb, the more swing you get.
AA10022566	Are you asking for the cheat code?  Simultaneously hold type "Ctrl Shift C".  This will open the cheat code box.  In the box type "MaxMotives".  (Everything without the quotation marks, of course)  That will fill all motives completely.    I assumed you were asking for the cheat, since to fill motives in the regular course of gameplay is pretty self-explanatory.  I mean, if you need to fill hunger, get some food from the fridge; if you need to fill energy, send your sim to bed, etc.
w2xsd28Qaa	i think you are supposed to have windows xp media edtion to do that.  if not, you can use a data cd or a memory stick to put it on.
w2xsd28Qaa	in a lot of the ayelid ruins there are vampires, especially the cave with mehrunes razor if you have that download (it was free around christmas).  other times, go into a cave and kill the bandits, leave and return later and sometime animals or vampires will have moved in.|`|FywIUdJ9aa	killing vampires :)  they are in caves and dungeons in the elder scroll series. if on morrowind ya can buy some from telvanni vendor i think but really just go kill vamps alot easier
w2xsd28Qaa	i think fighter is the best.  fighters can still learn to sneak up and backstab people, but can also win face to face, and i think all of the good spells take too much magic for mages to be effective.  And if you walk into a room with 4 daedra, theives and mages are a little out-muscled.
XHd41KvIaa	There are acctually 90. Only a few are acctually part of any quests. You shouldn't have any trouble finding them. I know there are several in the West Weald area, and several in south eastern Cyrodill, those seem to be the places that I have found the most.  The sigil are random. There is no reason to collect them, just make some awesome equipment.|`|w2xsd28Qaa	i think there are 16 gates, 1 or 2 near every city, then the rest are just kinda spread out over the land, then 1 big one outside burma.  you see them after you close the first one outside Kvatch.  Closing the gates is part of the "aide burma" quest.    i think i heard that there are 12 types of sigil stones, so it should be possible to get them all.  also, there was a glitch where you could take more than 1 by repeatedly tapping 'a', but i think they fixed it in a recent patch.  the stone you get is random, so you can save right before you grab it, then if you dont like the stone you get, load and try again til you get one you do like.|`|9Eea3sOSaa	Oblivion gates keep spawning until you finish the main questline. When you close one, another will pop up somewhere else.    Once you finish the main questline, they're all gone.
w2xsd28Qaa	the only RPG's for the xbox that i can think of are Fable and Marrowind.  They are fun, but not the traditional Turn-based combat.  Xbox really doesnt have any decent rpgs in the tradition of FF or shadow hears, or xenosaga, or anything else that came out for PS2.
o95ht8Cnaa	No it is not good for games. Next time you are at your local EB or gamestore have a look at the system requirements for the latest games.     Often you will see that the minimum requirements for a game (i.e. Flight simulator X) on an XP operating system will be about 256mb of ram. On Vista however its requirements are usually double this, 512mb ram.     Ofcourse thats just an example. But in a lot of the cases that happens.|`|w2xsd28Qaa	i dont think its good for games, they even had to make halo 2 again just for vista.  my sources should explain everything...|`|AA12064482	eeh not so much as windows but sure it plays some good ones.|`|RYZb8tA3aa	NEXT YEAR    :P    also     softwares
54a7c2d84ed3035f512ab13f5797d5daaa	Because its the only game that allows you to run around a city and do pretty much any kind of evil deed you want.    In GTA you can:  Bang hookers in your car  Steal cars  Kill random citzens   Run from the the cops  Kill the cops  Rob stores  Do missions for the mob  Fly helicopters and crash them into things.    The list goes on..... whats not to like about a game that lets you beat old ladies on the side walk with a black jack for no apparent reason?|`|w2xsd28Qaa	the game would be popular, but nowhere near where it is now if people didnt make such a big deal about it.  the more that the press and parents groups complain about it, the more kids are going to want to play it to see what is so bad.   i personally dont think that they're that good.    oh, and they have good soundtracks    There is no such thing as bad publicity....|`|enDn7Z9oaa	u can do any thing u want kill run drive shoot swim fly cheats and do any thing u want and do it|`|AA12033649	its a great series that has the player put into many cool situations that would be unnallowed in todays community the have everything a great videogame needs blood sex drugs guns and cars and women!!!!!! plus you can do almost anything imaginable|`|eceb3733dac41acb2209ee932703be3eaa	It is cathartic gameplay. You get to do stuff you cannot in real life and it just releases stress and tension subconsciously. Now if you take it out in the real world, you have some problems and need some help I think. But it is only a game, highly enjoyable game, and you get to do a lot in it that you cannot otherwise in real life.|`|1263731b76a5881b98bbd0aacec9a2cdaa	I think it's because players get the chance to play the criminal and do things they reasonably couldn't get away with in reality.     Also, with the resurgence of gangster (and Mafia-esque) appeal in our culture, another reason might be the chance to actually pretend to be one of these types of organized criminals, again something someone wouldn't reasonably do.    Cheers!! :)|`|yfI2LU9oaa	because they appeal to many who like to run people over shoot people in the head slap women about and u wont get arrested|`|rhcIgecGaa	because randomly shooting pedestrians and doing fun missions, blowing up cars, running from the cops, doing your bad boy dreams come true is the funnest thing possible, i love this series|`|df28ce33955a0ec0731590de3ae5cdccaa	mainly for the free roaming capability and the in-game cheats you can use.

There were conversions that the cabinets would have safety switches, one would be on the coin door, and the other location would be the rear service panel.     A quick trouble shooting would be, ensure the outlet works. Plug the game in. listen for anything powering up. check fuses and wiring connections.

d8JsGUlCaa	If you want an explanation from the game's story, Master Chief is John, SPARTAN 117. He is part of a military experiment with supersoldiers called the SPARTAN-II program. The Master Chief has biological, as well as cybernetic, enhancements. These enhancements give him superhuman strength, agility, perception, and endurance. His armor, called MJOLNIR (sp?), multiplies his already superhuman abilities. The armor also allows him to interact with AI's, such as Cortana. MJOLNIR also has a full heads-up display and regenerating shields. In game, he is acknowledged as the last remaining SPARTAN-II, but the books explain that there are more left and still in action. That's the gist of it.    Or if you want a shorter explanation, he's just a badass.|`|R7x0qIqyaa	He is Chuck Norris.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	master chief on halo is basically like a sergeant at a war.  he is a different kind of being, not human,  but hes a spartan.|`|c53w7vDzaa	to awsome to explain like chuck norris|`|5yiMk1k1aa	the offspring of chuck norris and jean claude van dam

kIqq7yIAaa	there's lots of software programs out that can outfit dungeons and treasure hoards    but the book is the best for creating all this  NPC's need to challenge the party  major NPC's just keep coming back for more  nothing beats a hand made dungeon for intrigue and suspense  populated with DM creations that will torment the party at every turn  after dealing with diabolical traps conceived by the DM's wicked mind  no computer can do all this well   only a good DM   this is why D&D is soo popular even over console games

B2KHmACoaa	Use "Un-du" it's an adhesive remover that you can find at any store that sells scrapbooking supplies.  You only need a couple drops, and it safely removes stickers, photo squares, old photo's ect.. from photo albums.  It has a tool attached to it that you use to gently glide under what ever it is you're trying to remove.  I've used it in the old fashioned photo albums (I think they're called "magnetic albums"), the ones that you lift up the clear sheet that are stuck down, and it works great!  I'd give that a try|`|3PS8IIfcaa	you should try cutting them out|`|Um51vk83aa	Just cut them out of the album, leaving the original paper backing on and then you can put them in a new album by using scrapbooking glue.

Continuous running water with a rotating blade.|`|ffxB7EdZaa	Put the bottle in a support that will allow you to turn the bottle but will hold the bottle vertically without tipping over.    Use a glass cutter to draw a line around the bottle where you want your cut.    Heat the line that you drew on the bottle. A candle works well for heating the line but do not allow the flame to touch the glass or it will turn the glass black. Turn the bottle slowly as you heat the entire line.    Go over the line with the heat five or six times.    Fill a bucket with cold water and submerge the bottle in the water while the glass is still hot. [Wear gloves and protective eyewear!] The extreme temperature change from hot to cold will cause the bottle to separate on the line that you cut.    Tap the glass bottle on either side of the line that you cut if the bottle does not separate on its own. Gently tapping the glass should cause it to come apart at the line.    Sand both of the glass edges with wet sand paper immediately after cutting the glass bottle so you do not get cut on the rough glass.|`|cfyMnEA9aa	laser!|`|sxKrb98Caa	Use a knife made purely of diamonds!

Heat the line that you made with the glass cutter. A candle works very well. Do not allow the flame to touch the bottle, or you will turn the bottle black.     4. Rotate the bottle slowly. Repeat this about four to six times.     5. Submerge the bottle in a bucket of cold water. Do this immediately after you have thoroughly heated the bottle. The change in temperature takes care of the rest. You may need to give it a little tap to separate it from the base.     6. Sand down the new edge with wet sandpaper.

YQ8YsYepaa	I dont think you can. You need to uninstall that version and find the chronicle you need to download. I assume you're looking to play on a private server not retail. You might check the server  website you're planning on logging into or forums to find a download. Google is probably your friend on that. I play retail so don't know of any specific site that you could find older versions on.
hiChBDPvaa	Yup, there is a game called loo.....    The game of Loo is sort of a hybrid of two types of gamesgambling and trick-taking. Players throw a certain amount of chips in the pot, hands are dealt and cards are played with the highest card taking the trick. However many tricks you win will dictate the amount of your payout for each hand. But if youre unable to take a trick, youll end up losing more than your initial wager which could take you out of the game. Loo is fairly fast to pick up.    HOW TO PLAY:    Difficulty: Moderately Easy   Things Youll Need:  Deck of cards   Poker chips     Step1  Divvy out the poker chips so that each player has an equal amount at the start of the game. A good number to begin with is 30 chips, but you may decide to use less or more depending on the desired length of play.     Step2  Ante in a total of 3 chips before the deck is dealt. In the game of Loo, you must pay to playeven before you see your hand. This sort of raises the stakes, though very small, for the game.     Step3  Deal out the deck until each player has a total of three cards in his or her hand. The unused deck is set to the side and the top card is turned face up. The suit of this card will act as trump for the hand.     Step4  Decide whether youd like to fold or play. When you opt to fold, you simply lay down your hand and lose your initial wager, but risk no more of your chips. When deciding to play know that you have two optionsstay with the hand dealt or exchange it for an entirely new hand. If you exchange your hand, even though you are doing so sight unseen, you must now play the new cards dealt to you.     Step5  Lay a card, starting with the person to the left of the dealer. You must follow suit when possible. Highest suited card takes the trick. If you are unable to follow suit, you must play trump unless someone else has already played trump and you are unable to trump over it. In this case, you may throw off. Highest trump card takes the trick. In either scenario, the winner of the trick will lead the next card.     Step6  Continue to play until all three tricks have been taken. Those players who have taken a trick will earn 1/3 of the pot. Of course, if youve taken two of the three tricks available, you would earn 2/3s of the pot. After the pot has been paid out, those players who were unable to take a trick will pay in 3 chips. These chips will be carried over to the next hand.     Step7  Continue to play each hand as described until all but one player is eliminated from by losing his chips. The last person with chips at the table is considered the winner of Loo.
aLyJe1b3aa	yes! get it|`|bEeozqacaa	Great game, great customization, graphics, weapons & story.|`|wXGRJEQCaa	its a sweet game i loved it awesome in almost all ways but once you beat it there isnt anything to do really .. i suggest rent it for a couple weeks rap it.. then rap it again then return it.|`|tlUihEOvaa	Let me tell you that Fallout 3 is one of the best role playing games I've ever played. It's like a sand box where you can do whatever and there are so many different ways to play the game. You can be a good guy, bad guy, neutral, and your actions really affect the character.     The story takes place after the nuclear weapons were fired around the world during a war between the U.S. and China. So then before everything was nuked and destroyed some pure people were preserve into underground vaults. Those living in the "wasteland" are radiated and struggle to survive mutants, raiders, and much more. The wasteland basically takes place in Washington D.C. So you play as a character who grew up in the vaults and later on ventures out of the vault.     The story is short but the world is big and fun to explore. There are tons of side quests even if the story line is short. There are random events and humor as you venture through the wasteland too.     Also they have 3 downloadable contents, one cmae out last month and 2 more are coming out.    Oh and if you are getting it for computer make sure your computer is capable. Check the requirements.|`|mnQXmZbeaa	yes|`|nRRt57efaa	Just from spectating this game looks like a 5/5. I really don't like the way you kill things though. ( From gameplay videos on youtube it looks like you just click the body or character you're trying to kill and then choose the spot to shoot on the body. Which seems a little to easy imo. And in all of that the whole game freezes so other people can't shoot you. Or so it seems, I may be wrong, but that's what I saw on the gameplay videos. ) Other than that, it looks like a really good game.|`|ceF5X2m7aa	ehh its challenging but yeah its worth buying..  btw its awesome finding girls with a good taste in games..|`|HUfm3KrLaa	I totally loved it. It is worth buying and playing several times after you've beaten it.|`|V8xAbMiEaa	well i was made by bethesda, who made oblivion. it feels just like it. the combat isnt like most fps's and its a little clunky in that aspect. other than that it has a good story line, and you can interact with almost everything. one of the only things i didnt like was the environment. the game takes place after a nuclear holocaust. so dont expect very pretty looking environments. all in all tho    yah:D|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	When do you think your going to shut the hell up and do something worth typing you retard? :)|`|wCZ3T5QLaa	It depends a lot on your style of gaming. I was impressed by Fallout 3. The storyline has nothing to do with the first 2 games. If you enjoy a Role Playing Game this is it. Its set in the Washington DC in the distant future. China launched a nuclear attack on America and everything is left in waste. Your raised in an underground vault community and one day your father leaves the vault and you must venture out to find him. You basically lay waste to the wastelands with melee weapons (bats, sledgehammers, etc) and guns (pistols, rifles, futuristic weapons of the like) Its best played in 1st person but can be toggled to 3rd person. It has a good storyline with many hours of gameplay involved. I bought it after christmas and have been playing since.|`|rj5FE3Klaa	mmmmhmm, can i watch u play it nekkid?|`|BPKoxVMZaa	i think u can get a crack 4 it my bro has cracks 4 a few games i think fallout is one of them -is it the one with the strange person(man) in every pic? if yes then u can get a crack - u download the disk and i u have a virtual disk drive u put it in and install the game on the disk there should b a a file named exe in a folder called crack replace the exe installed on ur computer with the crack and then u have a free copie of the game|`|Kddjmy4Aaa	Well I got it as a Gift, Played it though And Had some fun just Shooting things and seeing the blood.    The Main Story Is Very short and a bit Tedious. But It's fun just to try to find All you can.    At first the game was a bit challenging considering You die every 5 minutes because everything is so much stronger than you. But After Awhile I got pissed off Because When you die you have to backtrack quite a bit.    But to be honest It was a bit boring at points.    At one point in the game I Was bored because I was too leveled up for anything to be a challenge, It was like Playing Knights of the old republic 2 All over again.     If you play it try not to level up to fast or It will get boring.  Its definatly a great game, I wouldn't say buy it, I'd say Either get it as a gift or Rent it off gamefly.    It Also is the game that Broke my PS3's Hard Drive.  Damn Game.|`|Oy7AGmCUaa	Fallout 3 is a huge step away from fallout 1 and 2.  The gameplay is hugely different.  Jump in, you will either love it or hate it.|`|iUWLZowFaa	yes... well that is if you like open maps rpg's and the most unique game play ever (in a good way :P) so yes|`|IWdtTAUfaa	All the fallout games follow the basic back story of a post nuclear war enviroment. The game itself is hugely different considered its all in first person. One of the major issues in the world is that there is not enough clean water and basically that what your main quest turns out to be: Helping your dad find a way to purify mass amounts of water. Theres a few twists and turns, Bad guys try and stop you...stuff like that. Its an awesome game from start to finish but the main story is a little short. Theres a lot of fun side quests though.    Oh and it's pretty gory so that's always fun    oh and The graphics are gorgeous|`|eMFRN0HCaa	If you are interested, do it! It is a rad game, and gets you involved. Buy it and vote me fore best answer|`|cEAtQVJyaa	its dopee id try it out|`|94x96rs0aa	Fallout 3 is essentially when you look at the game type it's Oblivion with guns and aliens. It's from the same people who did oblivion. You have the chance to be Good/Evil/Neutral and there are many opportunities to change for better/worse. The problem with Fallout 3 is that once you complete the game you cannot go back into it to get any side quests and such you missed like you could in Oblivion. My opinion is to rent it to try it out and if you like it buy it.|`|6N7eF9tBaa	Fallout 3 is  one of the best games I've ever played. It takes place 50 years after Fallout 3 and has only the games historical reference as links to the last two games so you don't need toplay the first two too fully enjoy it.|`|a8tsrTCbaa	Yes it is. Open world, Nice character customization. Its impossible to see everything in one play through. Multiple endings. You don't have to play Fallout 1 or 2 to enjoy it.

I wouldn't spend much time and gold on items that you will replace in a few levels. Although i do suggest doing a bit of research on which instances drop items for you. You can find items here     http://thottbot.com/|`|AH8YRRI8aa	Unless you're twinking, the game really only starts once you hit 80.  I wouldn't worry too much about getting great gear at 30: as someone already said, you'll be replacing it soon enough anyway.  That said, it's worth doing instances as you level, if only to give you some experience at playing your class in a group.  If you still want to find some gear updates, google "wow armory."  That's Blizzard's official site.  It will let you look up any character above lvl 10.  You can then click individual pieces of your gear and see what they recommend as updates.  You may have to refine the search a little to make sure that it's coming up with items for your class/level range.  Alternately, you can do a search for items without looking at your character: e.g look up leather chest-pieces for lvl 28-35 or something similar.  It should be able to tell you where some of your updates might come from.  You could also try wowwiki.  They have lists of all of the loot that drops from each instance, though that means you have too look up each loot table seperately.  I hope some of this helped?  Good luck, and may all you hits be crits. :D
31fDBuLjaa	Good premise. It'd be cool to see the U.S., however destroyed, as you progressed through the game ... like if you had a battle with zombies east of LA, survive it, then you head out on the highway, then cut, then back on, and you're heading into Las Vegas, which is all complete wreckage.    Etc.    "On the Apocalyptic Road"|`|zozNBHcJaa	It sounds like an awesome game idea. I'd play it. It would be even sweeter if you could make a co-op mode where you and 1 or 2 of your friends could play control the three people. But instead of Apocalypse you should name it The Undead Apocalypse or something like that.|`|Oy7AGmCUaa	If you are going to make this game in flash then it sounds like it will be fun!

Surviving nuclear holocaust / scavaging weapons / fighting zombies (ghouls in Fallout) has been made. But if you make it an original game with a unique storyline you might get a hit....or not...|`|a8tsrTCbaa	Sounds good but if it is completely based on killing zombies while heading towards D.C. it may start to get boring.

You are in control of when to start and when to stop playing.|`|sxKrb98Caa	Yes that hurts, just some really really bad luck. It happens, maybe not that severe to most people but it does happen like you already know. Just a little advice if you don't know already, don't play anymore tonight, give it some time take a break and you'll be back. Well just think of it this way, this is the worst that it'll get right? And move on    HMM to that guy under me, shut the hell up LOL no one wants to hear you being a smart ***. He just lost money, he doesnt need to hear ur techinal explanation on how it happened.|`|eNHGiEvGaa	Sometimes the depth of one's bad luck is unfathomable.  Everyone has runs like this occassionally.

You got an unlikely set of hands in an unlikely order, but that does not make you unlucky, if anything you were more lucky to have witnessed such an improbable set of events. It is unlikely to happen to anyone else just like that ever again.|`|4TAMbaWjaa	It is very unlucky. You can get some of that money sent back to you though if you play on a different site like full tilt or absolute so that you can get rakeback.|`|MHcMY2Pfaa	Sounds like a bad night, I have had them and I have also had Freaken awesome nights. it's just how the odds play out at times.|`|4Src7JvBaa	you shouldn't be taking your hands to showdown all the time like that. bigger pushes on the flop may not pay you out as much but they push people off their draws.    also some people make loose calls, if one needs runners to make a straight and they call a large bet that's bad poker.    if you play more hands you will offset the long shot winners with consistent good play.    look at what you said, A4 isn't a good hand to call a bet 5x. later someone called your all in with no pair hoping for back door straight or overcards. these players were really playing BAAD but got lucky, don't get tilted, keep playing well.

Also It will need the bios file "cpzn1" to be able to play.    strider2 is the same as SF FX not ready yet. You will need the bios file "cpzn2"  to be able to play.

eceb3733dac41acb2209ee932703be3eaa	When you are playing are far away from the console? Could possibly be range issues. Another reason could be something getting in the way of the wave to the system from the controller. Keep the controller facing the console, stay close, make sure the console has nothing around it, and do not move the controller all around keep it facing the console or keep it close. If not, it sounds like something might be wrong with the controller. Buy a new one or use a friend's controller and if it doesn't happen than it is your controller.

7qh1Gm6laa	First, where are u hooking your ethernet up to?? you cannot hook it straight to your computer, even if your laptop is getting a wirless connection.  You have to use a router or hub to split the connection.  If you do have a wirless router, then you should get a wireless adapter for your ps2.  Second, what is the purpose behind the phone line, you can not play using a dial up connection, so try unplugging that.  It is hard to tell what is wrong, unless you give us a clear picture of your setup.|`|AA11411110	Do you have cable internet connection?

The ps3 comes with built in wi-fi and blu-ray so 600$ is not even close to a lot when it comes to how powerful it is.  Just give it some time to release more games and I can GUARANTEE the ps3 will be more popular.  Who knows if people are saving up their money for the ps3 anyways, im pretty sure they are considering how much it is.  But the 360 is only better right now because it has been out for like 2 years...just give it some time and sony is going to conquer.  Or ya know...the nintendo wii would be the best of all...lol!

fRkZLEX5aa	The Wii is so fun, I recommend you to buy one ^_^.  Just watch your tv with the Wii remote... I learnt the hard way..  *Runs away crying*|`|smeaQXafaa	Not unless they decide to make Resident Evil 5 for wii!|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	Edit:The guy below me says that the Wii is good because it gets you moving..well I don't know about him..but I buy video games to have fun..now I don't see any problem with swinging your arms around while playing zelda and stuff...but if you want to lose weight..I say go out and freaking meet people and have fun at the gym...ect.     Edit:I have a wii and a dreamcast..so I know what I'm talking about.      No.The Wii is not worth getting.It has crap games..just like the 360 and ps3.Most games for it are 2 star mediocre pieces of crap.If you want a real game system..try the dreamcast.I know what your thinking now..your thinking I'm telling you to get a old crappy out of date console..well no..your completely wrong.The dreamcast is the ultimate gaming console..way better than these next gen pieces of garbage.You want a Wii?Well try this..The dreamcast has the same..if not better graphics than the Wii.The Dreamcast also has better motion controls than the Wii.Plus..it runs smoother online than the Wii.Another plus..is that now today in this time..its really cheap.Whatever though..its your choice.I don't really care...|`|yiQwERHPaa	heck yes family fun for everyone!    trust me i got a wii a while back, fell in love with wii sports, wii play, super smash bros brawl, mario kart wii, and high skool musical 2 karoke lol my parents also enjoi it :]|`|u5AMqHevaa	Edit: Don't get the dreamcast. I mean really? The dreamcast?     Well it all depends.    Nintendo has always made more family oriented, kid friendly games. This doesn't mean you won't get your typical shooter games or action/adventure, but this is the platform designed with kids in mind (think mario, yoshi, donkey kong etc.)     The Wii, as I'm sure you know, is great because it gets you moving with games like Wii Sports etc. And it's really fun to play all those games. If you like the idea of getting up and moving, then I do recommend the Wii for you. And it's a relatively new system, so there are still lots of new innovative things nintendo will do with the Wii.    Although, based on your tv, the slight drawback of the Wii is that it doesn't send out an HD signal. So a PS3 or an Xbox would def. look a lot better on your nice 52" plasma, but at the end of the day video games are about content, not quality! At least for me.     Hope that helps!|`|chrz5L6zaa	yes i got 1 for xmas and it would be good on a 52'' full HD plasma|`|JVdXMACYaa	Yes! I just bought one and its great. The Wii fit is also a great game, its fun and keeps you active.|`|8a7e71ee2bd9bad29f32a0260235464caa	My TV is bigger ;)    But seriously. Wii is really fun. If you have a lot of parties/get togethers at your house, I would reccommend it. It's also a good babysitter if you have kids or young relatives to entertain.   It's one of those "Great for the whole family" things but gets boring fast on your own|`|e9695c75152e6d757a83f3e1f8134384aa	I bought a Wii about a year ago and aside from super mario galaxy and mario kart all the games blow. stick with Xbox 360
f38329bba040e33716494ab059a46218aa	the cheapest stitch holder is waste yarn in your house, preferably a contrasting colour to your knitting. many people also prefer that the yarn they use should be smooth. Infact, dental floss has been recommended in many knitting circles, but I prefer contrast colour yarn.    here's how:  using a long piece of contrast colour, thread it through the stitches you want to hold using a darning needle and then you can remove the stitches from the needles. once you remove them from the needles, you can tie the ends of the contrast yarn together to hold the stitches securely until you need them again.    if you want to use DPNs, you will have to secure the ends so that the stitches don't fall out. you can easily use small rubberbands on one end as you pick the stitches and then close the other end with more rubberbands.    hope this helps.    happy knitting!!|`|154dzJ1Faa	If you are making a sweater and using stitch holders, they are going to be in there for quite a few rows of knitting and turnings, so double points are probably not a good thing to use.  In a pinch, you could attach a rubber band to both ends somehow, but I wouldn't want to risk it.  I have seen little hand-made pockets on elastics that you slipped over the ends of dps, but have not made any yet.  Wooden needles would be better since they usually don't slide out as easily.    You could, however, use circular needles. They don't slip out as easily.  I would find the long ends of the cables bothersome, but they can be used if you have nothing else. There are the interchangeable needles where you can put stoppers on the ends -- only use the cable -- that would be a good solution.    However, a stitch holder is used only to hold the stitches while they are not being used, and will be picked up later.  You don't want them to run back down into your work.  Anything that will hold the loops will work.  I have used a piece of smooth yarn (one good use for ackrilic) run through all the stitches, and if long enough, you can tie the ends together so they never get away.  Use a contrast colour, and never a fuzzy yarn!    If I only had a few stitches, I have used a large safety pin.  If you have a kilt pin (like a very large safety pin), you could use one of those.  I found a number of stitch holders in a bag with some other knitting needles and gadgets at a thrift shop.  I was very pleased to get those!    If you look around your place, I'm sure you will find something that will fit through those stitches, and won't fall out easily.|`|M9FQSKRwaa	try using a separate circular needle that is the same size as the needles that you are working with.|`|hDOGuKlzaa	Is it to mark your stitches?  If so, I use bobby pins.  They abundant, cheap, and easy to remove.      If it's to hold many stitches, here is a link I found on how to make your own:  http://zakkalife.blogspot.com/2008/02/ho...    or if you use the DPNs, maybe put a rubber band at the end to keep the stitches from falling off.  Hope this helps.

YrouAv6eaa	Tiene que ver el entorno en que vives porque imaginate un ni?o de unos 8 que consiga un juego Mature(adultos).     Lo tuvo que haber consiguido por malas juntas el entorno en que vive si sus padres supieran no lo dejaran tener el juego pero como no se preocupan por l.    Yo pienso que es el entorno en que vive y de ah sigue el papel del juego.    Recuerda que tambin te pueden dejar algo bueno, por ejemplo si una persona juega y no sabe ingls aprende del juego tambin te hace razonar mucho ms rpido, y puedes divertirte jugando.    Yo tambin defiendo los videojuegos.  Hay que ver la clasificacin del juego simpre hay que fijarse o comprarlo pero tener un criterio amplio o sea no tomar tanto en serio el juego.|`|510e599791830a66e90aea2ee688b01caa	mira, cuando no existian los videos juegos quemaban brujas, existia el ku klux klan, y hubo 2 guerras mundiales|`|ae518bc07562e1fa7f0682cebdc05765aa	Pues ah es cuando viene mucho en cuenta las llamadas CLASIFICACIONES...  Si lo has notado los videojuegos con bombas, sangre, violencia e incluso imagenes sexuales son clasificados apra adultos, los cuales en su mayora tenemos el criterio para saber que eso no es correcto en la vida real...    El problema se presenta cuando los ni?os consumen videiojuegos para adultos y sus padres no los orientan o supervisan, ahi es cuando crean violencia, porque para ellos la vida es un juego y entonces recrean lo que ven.|`|VrBF7lZuaa	la influencia es algo que influye influyentemente|`|c31579c85f58341fd0683c47c5649237aa	yo digo que los videojuegos no tienen nada que ver , todo esta en su entorno familiar , que tipo de amigos tienen etc etc.,   yo soy una persona tranquila y siempre respetando a los demas., y los juegos que mas me gustan son de violencia,.e igual en las peliculas., quiero ver mas y mas sangree jejej., y no pasa nada.,..   saLudos!!|`|541dfaa2919daf905bb0ed4f34f117ceaa	Pues desgraciadamente ha habido hechos que asi lo demuestran, en Estados Unidos ocurrio un hecho de relevancia publica, un "gamer" de unos 17 a?os, por tanto jugar con el juego Grand Theft Auto Vice City, se le creo una conciencia fuera de la realidad y en ese tiempo el mismo penso que era el protagonista del juego, tomo el arma de su padre y como lo hacia Tomy Vercetty, salio a la calle y robo un coche de manera violenta, pero luego decidio no volver a su casa y se quedo dormido en un aparcamiento de coches, unos oficiales de policia que andaban por la zona vieron al chico dentro del auto y revisaron las placas que este tenia, descubrieron que el auto tenia reporte de robo y despertaron al chico y lo detuvieron por interrumpir la via publica, lo llevaron a la comisaria de policia y le preguntaron porque tenia un coche robado, nuevamente el joven creyo que estaba en el juego y viendose en la comisaria de policia, decidio repetir la matanza que tenia lugar en el juego, cuando el oficial de policia se le acerco para hacerle una pregunta, este lo golpeo, le arrebato el arma que tenia en el cinturon y le disparo tres veces, con un tiro en la cabeza, luego el chico salio de la habitacion y disparo contra otro oficial que estaba fuera y con extraordinaria precision, le disparo a un oficial que le pego la bala en la pura frente, intentando escapar, hirio a otros dos oficiales mas hasta que se le acabaron las balas pero no logro salir a tiempo, los oficiales heridos lo detuvieron antes de que saliera como loco a las calles, lo juzgaron y lo condenaron por homicidio de tres oficiales e hirio a otros dos, cuando sea mayor de edad cumplira una condena de 50 a?os de prision pero por ahora estara en al tutelar. El mismo interpreto sus acciones como el loco del juego que era su favorito, los familiares de los oficiales mueros demandaron a la familia y a la compa?ia Rockstar Games por incluir violencia extrema en sus juegos, "La vida es como un videojuego, tarde o temprano, te mueres" exclamo el chico. Eso demuestra que la extrema violencia en los juegos de video pueden causar trastornos psicologicos que llevan a actuar como si realmente estuvieras dentro del juego, matar policias y robar coches como en el Grand Theft Auto, a mi me encanta ese juego pero nunca llegare tan lejos como ese chico, es un psicopata.

The only way you'll be able to put together the petpet lab map will be to already have put together the secret laboratory map and have access to the regular pet lab ray.     Assuming you already have access to the regular pet lab ray, go to the link I've posted below and you'll see the option of "petpet" at the end of the row (you'll only see the "petpet" option if you already have the regular pet lab ray).If you have all the pieces of the petpet lab map in your inventory, go to the "petpet" option and the pieces will be put together and you'll have the petpet lab ray.

kpbzYuoraa	Sometimes Mattel does special OOAK dolls for charity auctions, but most OOAKs are done by doll artists who aren't affiliated with Mattel.  At Barbie conventions, there are OOAK competitions, and doll magazines like Haute Doll frequently feature articles on top OOAK artists, and tips for beginners.    It can include repainting part, or all of the face, cutting or restyling the hair, completely replacing the hair, moving the head to a different type body, or creating new clothes and accessories.  Outside of the few dolls Mattel has made, all artist done dolls are made with regular retail dolls.    I'm not sure when OAAK fashion dolls became widespread, but I assume it was in the 1990s.  Some sites I like are:    http://www.onesixthsense.com/  http://www.wideeyedgirls.com/  http://www.dollyhair.com/|`|Xm5ab6F6aa	Ooak is and artist made doll and one of a kind because its hand-made and painted with specially made clothes They will repaint the face as to change or enhance the features.

In the center of each one is a sparkly sorcerer's stone. Use your hands to mold some polymer clay (such as Sculpey III) into a small mushroom shape, then press plenty of glitter onto the clay surface. Next, press the bottom of the clay "stem" onto the inner lid of a small clean jar so that it is firmly attached. Fill the jar almost to the top with water and stir in a few drops of glycerin (sold at most pharmacies) and 1/2 teaspoon of glitter. The glycerin will increase the density of the water and cause the glitter to fall more slowly. Finally, tightly screw the lid onto the jar and invert the globe|`|QaEmuwY8aa	I would suggest getting an american girl magazine and looking at the crafts in there.

Problem solved!|`|2x41IPGcaa	most game consoles today have the option to swap to left handed controls. so all the controlls will work for the left handed person.  im left handed and when the controlls are altered for me it makes perfect game play. fall of man is a good example. couldnt do it right handed way. but swapped it around and hey presto im as good as u can get!|`|AA11495785	try any on the Wii  You can chose which hand to choose for aiming.  I use left sometimes and sometimes right.

mTNz8GHGaa	While the game advocates your using the Pig to find a truffle, it is possible to find a truffle using only your hoe. In the Fall season, look for the fluffy pink Mora trees. Outside of the 3x3 space designated for trees to grow, till some surrounding squares. Check on it daily, and if a till-spot disappears without the help of a weed, a truffle may be lying below. Dig it up with your hoe, and ship it. The first time you ship a truffle, you'll get the Oink Oink Note.    --------------------------------------...    The Squid Prince can be caught on the island that the dolphin takes you to.  It can only be caught on the day after it rains, but weather conditions on the day after it rains are immaterial.  If another rainy day follows the first, ithat simply gives a player one more day in which to catch the King Fish.       The Squid Prince is not available in every season.  It can be caught in the Summer or Winter seasons, but not Spring. (Whether or not it can be caught in Autumn is still debated amongst players.)

75af7936914f071f0bf372ce806188c9aa	Quote from IGN's review:          Skirmish is the offline(OFFLINE) component of multiplayer, and is effectively a practice arena where you can take on up to 15 bots in multiplayer matches. You can pick all of your criteria for your rounds and test yourself against the bots, which all react to you based on the difficulty level that you set for them (again, going off the game's four difficulty settings). You'll also decide the match types you want to play, many of which are familiar to multiplayer veterans. Body Count is Team Deathmatch; Search and Retrieve is essentially Capture the Flag; and Capture and Hold is a zone-based mode.|`|gF26JyzBaa	Greek, according to last month's ps nation podcast, a representative said they will not include any local multiplayer, including even 2 player split screen. please choose mine as best cause i'm on your contacts!

While your victim is asleep, give him or her an extreme makeover. Use as much makeup and hairspray as you can. Make sure you are quiet though, so you don't wake him or her up. When your victim awakes, they will freak out after looking in mirror.  While your victim is asleep, put a tomato down the rear of his pants. During his sleep, when he rolls over he will smash it up.

kIqq7yIAaa	no modern pewter has no toxic fumes  but your heat source will so do this in a well ventilated site like the garage with the big door open    heating it will soften the metal so you can reshape it without splitting or breaking it as would happen if you tried it cold  the only way to fuse it back together is to melt it down and repour it  as long as your not bending it repeatedly those tiny internal cracks are not an issue

7beff2801682ee45b1c21db21b38fd27aa	An adapter that goes over 54Mbps would be pointless, your router can't go faster anyway. Odds are your 14Mbps connection is probably faster than your DSL link. So there isn't anything to upgrade in your home network to improve your performance.    Since your router is 'full', the only thing that might be within your control would be to shut down the other devices that might be going out the DSL link.    The limit will be the link to the provider, most of those won't be faster than 10Mbps or so anyway.|`|22xCVbIVaa	I play on ~7 Mb/s via Wireless adapter, through 3 walls. I still get 4 bars. I don't see why you need > 10 Mb/s for COD.. Let alone any game. Plus Xbox 360 has a nifty little thing in it that limits your connection speed on Xbox Live. So someone who is running T1 doesn't have a huge advantage over someone who is running low-end DSL.|`|VInznJzdaa	I also have a DSL connection, but from Verizon. Honestly, you MUST purchase the official Xbox 360 Wireless Adaptor. I know it's expensive ($99.99), but it's worth every penny. Check my sources for a link to Amazon, because as of this posting, they are selling it for only $76.99 with FREE shipping! That's the lowest price I can find on the internet!     I've had the official adapter since this past Christmas and I have never had a connection problem. It's approved by Microsoft and it connects wirelessly with my router. No wires. Just clean and simple. It's worth it. Trust me.|`|nZpSM7ngaa	stay off of youtube to not lag

If they have the same high card then the two players usually divide the pot in two.     *note- the guy is right about the suit ranking but nobody ever knows or follows it. o_O|`|oHG2kwc8aa	This is taken from the Official Rules of Poker on the Virtual Felt website:    There are 52 cards a standard poker deck, and the ranking of the individual cards, from high to low, is ace, king, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. There are 4 suits: spades, hearts, diamonds,and clubs. There is no ranking between the suits - so for example the king of hearts and the king of spades are equal.     Suits do not matter at all in Poker games.  If the Straights were equal, it is a split pot.  Or else the Straight with the highest "ceiling" would win.

Maybe yours is like mine, it will just sit there 75% of the time when I put in a game.  When that happens, I have to reset & apply lots of pressure to the top of the box (like I have my hands over the cd itself only on top of it) and lean down on it until the game starts up.    Sounds crazy, and it's a huge pain but I started doing this so long ago..  I have one of the first out, older kinds that are thicker than the rest, and the newer thinner ones end up with the same problems - which is why I didn't go out and buy a new one.
