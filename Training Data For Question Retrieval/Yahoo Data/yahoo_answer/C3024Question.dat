20090220134200AAVCraE	Local Businesses;United States;Miami	What's it like in Boca Raton, FL?	Hey... so I stumbled upon a question about Boca Raton, FL and all the things I hear about it are horrible and that makes me upset because my friend was thinking about going this summer and taking me and I was excited about it! What is there to do there? Is it really as bad as people say it is and are the people there all really mean? If anyone can fill me in, that'd be great. I hope I'm wrong because I might be going and I want it to be fun!
