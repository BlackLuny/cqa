b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I'd mapquest this to get a general idea.  And, as you know, how far it is and how long it takes may be two very different things, depending on what time of day you travel.|`|41479d464ed912b4157bcb71a2bae530aa	30 minutes|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, that veries. Anywhere from 30 minutes by car to 2 and a half hours by train.    Good luck
AA11275863	About the same as you would spend living in Oklahoma, Michigan, Vermont, etc.....|`|rPbyDmjYaa	Depends on the family.  4 adults living in a house spend an average of $140 a week. That's not for a lot meat or veggies either.  So I would say probably $150-$160 a week.
iFZqTzcUaa	If you are willing to travel by car:- the southwest (pemberton) for the big forests and touristy stuff. Margaret River for wines and wicked beach, loads of funky tourist shops too and kalamunda, great craft stores and markets, antiques n stuff - if thats what your into?     No car:- Zoo (but those are everywhere), kings park for the view of the city and Fremantle, hippy central - lots of cafes, novelty and funky shops, hertiage buildings, museums, beach and board walk all in walking distance to eachother - while your in freo to a jail tour (night ones are scarey!) Google fremantle jail. Northbridge is your place for clubs and pubs, 5 minutes by train from the city.|`|Lt8UFEIoaa	yes dont forget Kings Park, do a river cruise. The west coast hwy is a scenic drive that has great views all the way up the coast. there is a free bus service called the CAT which takes you around the city centre which is a great way to see everything and get your bearings. Fremantle is a great maritime port city (you can do a river cruise from perth to freo) and definitley dont forget the Swan Valley for wineries chocolate tasting, and breweries. If you have time, a trip down south to Margaret river and Pemberton (to name a few) is a must.|`|55h0RaYKaa	Rottnest Island, Fremantle, and road trip down to Margaret River.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Kings park   the Zoo and the coast Cottesloe, scarborough to Hillarys areas|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	Rottnest Island,Fremantle and Kings Park.|`|qSjJwJ28aa	In addition to the other answers, the Swan Valley is great, so are the southern towns of Margaret River, Busselton and Bunbury which are each only a couple of hours outside of Perth. I remember there was a cool park with a Tram in it in the Northern Suburbs which was good - well if you've got kids it's good.
ravzJTVOaa	it is a 6 hrs trip to Cairo by bus .  the fare is 50Egyptian pounds one way .  when you arrive at Sharm el Sheikh , you will get a visa that will allow you to come over to Cairo.  in Cairo , you must get an accommodation in a hotel for a night or two.  two nights is advisable so that you can have the chance to visit the Pyramids and the Sphinx on one day , and the Egyptian Museum on the next .  you can take a Nile Cruise in an evening with a show and dinner .  make the arrangements , and enjoy your trip.|`|AlbJmy7aaa	Be very careful. It can be nearly impossible or very expensive (read: charge you how much they want) in order to get the Mainland Egyptian visa when you are inside Sinai already.    The Sinai visa is issued automatically, but does not allow you to go very far West.      I recommend contacting the Egyptian consulate in your country and obtaining the visa ahead of time, as it often requires a wait (sometimes days) and for you to submit passport sized photos along with your request.    The Bus is only $10 & can take 6 hours.. or more. It is faster to take a mini-bus because there are less stops, however it is considered dangerous (at least by night).    It actually isn't that bad of a trip. The main delay is to stop at Suez for a fairly strict police checkpoint.    Once in Cairo, you will want to spend at LEAST a few days. A day for the pyramids. A day for Giza. A day for the museum and maybe a day to relax.    I would give yourself at 4 or 5 days including the bus, MINIMUM.|`|7PCssHMIaa	Who told you 300, it costs 100 return inc taxes with egyptair, but still you should save your money and go by bus.

p3mLEnyFaa	The prices vary.     but i assure you that a small holding in the UK will be a bigger holding in the SA.     the Pound/Rand exchange rate is about R13 for One Pound.     Look at the following online resources to get an idea of the home prices.     Prices areas in South Africa are:    Johannesburg: Sandton, Bryanston, Fourways, NorthCliff, Little Falls (basically the Northern suburbs) where homes range from R 1 mill - 10 mil. so, thats about 76 000 Pounds - 760 000 Pounds.     Other Cities where homes are expensive are Capetown (Sea Point, Camps Bay etc) and Durban.     Kimberley, bloemfontein are not that expensive when compared to Johannesburg for example.     Johannesburg Homes start at around R600 000. (46000 Pounds). but these are your basic small homes. more along the lines of apartments and townhouses.     Goodluck with your research.   Take care  GreyBlack|`|T42Nt3Lyaa	Definitely cheaper, a smallish house in England will buy a very big house in South Africa.    A nice middle class home of say four bedrooms, and  a swimming pool on a decent piece of land in a good neighborhood will cost around R2 million (in Cape Town). In one of the more Elite neighborhoods this same house will sell for around 4 million.    To get a very nice house say in Clifton will cost around R10 million upwards.    If you need more info have a look at http://www.pamgolding.co.za/ , they are SA's largest real estate agency.

Bring an umbrella. It rains all the time for like an hour or so. And bring money. Lots to do!|`|7HxJvbjMaa	I live in Florida too. This is not the rainy season so you don't really need to bring an umbrella. It is in the 50's at night and 60's/70's during the day because it is winter. It is probably warmer than that in Miami, and cooler in Tallahassee. I am in central Florida so I can only speak for the Tampa Bay area. You'll need a light jacket or hoodie. I don't know what temperatures you are used to so you might be ok with shorts or capris. Most FL natives are wearing jeans this time of year.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	You don't mention if you are going for a few days or for a long time, or whether or not you will have access to laundry facilities.  I will assume you will have laundry facilities.    If female you need:    3 short sleeve tops  1 long sleeve light top  3 skirts or shorts or other light bottoms   1 longer, slightly warmer long pants or long skirt  1 dress or evening outfit  3-5 undies   3 bras  1 bathing suit.  1 light sweater (nights are cool.  Socks/Pantyhose      If male, you need...  3 short sleeve tops  1 long sleeve light top  3 light pants or shorts or other light bottoms   1 longer, slightly warmer long pants  1 dress outfit  3-5 undies   1 bathing suit.  1 light sweater or maybe jacket  appropriate socks.    You want to bring clothes that are either all neutrals or in the same color family.  You want all your tops to coordinate with your bottoms, and certainly have the light sweater or jacket go over your dress outfit for evening.  This is so everything mixes and matches, although as long as your dress outfit goes with your light sweater or jacket, you can go outside the box with that outfit.    Enjoy your trip!

Y5qIP5kPaa	WELL , In  Divorce , there is Rahmah ( mercy), if the couple can not believe anymore that they can live with each others, I would advise a divorce, with some limits:<br>  FIRST why divorce is better:<br>  1) it is better for the man not to be unfair to the woman , and gives her the chance to find a different suitor who may be better and fair to her than this man himself<br>  2) It is better for the man to be fair to Himself,, we also have responsibility towards ourselves  to have a happy  life<br>  3) it is better for the Kids not to feel they are responsible of unpleasant life for the parents,,, That will be felt even if the children are young, plus it is for their sake not to live in unpleasant family<br>  <br>  The limits:<br>  -from the definition of manhood, definition of a lady, definition of maturity,,, we do not just divorce because we (feel ) in love with someone else,,,if everyone who feels in love again with a different person  .divorces the majority of people will do so,,, I would recommend divorce if there is abuse or hate between the couple (not because some of them feel in love again with someone else and can not hold him/her self  -behab 3la rohoho  ya3ni...lol)<br>  - In case of divorce the couple should make sure that the kids are not lost in between,, there are lots of legal/religious aspects should be followed to assure that,,, plus of course lots of (humanity lows)|`|voXWtdsSaa	I recommend that he sacrifices with his love and with his happiness for his family?|`|hhhk499qaa	Wel he should marry his love and at the same time see his children.|`|5Zi1uaEYaa	i dont want to answer that question but i agree with zoser on that but i don't recommend to stay till the kids grow up that's totally un fair to the woman with him she will lost her youth with a man who take her as step while if he divorce she may be able to marry from a man who will love her but if he wait till the kids grow and just leave her u know women after specific age will not be easy to re marry,but in some case divorce is mercy to all the family|`|1op04gcFaa	i know that it is not that easy, but i have to say that it is better to have a divorce immediately and not to wait for the children to grow up. <br>  if he scarifies his love and his happiness for his family, how would their life look like? there is no way that he would not resent her every day for having to stay with her. and there is no possibility that the wife would not notice that something is not right. she will find out eventually, or he may even accidentally tell her, maybe in an argument. what kind of life would they have then? they would despise each other and maybe even hate each other. and consider the environment in which their children would grow. it would be a hell for them. yes, they would physically have their both parents by their sides, but the atmosphere in which they would grow up would be in the best case an atmosphere of indifference between their parents. what would be the consequences on the lives of children then.<br>  so, a divorce in a good way, as you stated and under the terms that Zoser mentioned (''that the kids are not lost in between,, there are lots of legal/religious aspects should be followed to assure that,,, plus of course lots of (humanity lows)''), is the best and the most honest thing he or anyone can do. somehow, i think of an idea of a person living in a marriage with one person and loving the other in the same time as being dishonest to himself, to his wife, his family and to the one he loves. it is maybe the same as cheating.<br>  yes, divorce will be painful for them both and for the children, but it will pass. everything passes.|`|5YPh5RXPaa	There are 2 points of view concerning this issue.<br>  1st, that the man and woman sacrifice their happiness in order to sustain the house and so that the children won't be emotionally hurt,because a break between mums and dads has real negative consequences on the child.<br>  2nd, that if you are unhappy,  you can't reflect any happiness on your children and your misery will be reflected on them and they'll live in misery as well so it would be best for all to separate. <br>  As far as I'm concerned, I believe that people are different and if one can sacrifice his/her happiness for the sake of the children, someone else can't, so there are no rules here, a man or a woman does what is best according to their circumstances, and according to those surrounding them and at the end they are bound to reach a sensible conclusion that will make them and their children comfortable. <br>  But your Q has another important factor, that one shouldn't choose a husb/wife quickly without being sure of one's emotions. That love will come after marriage is a great myth.  Life has demands and sacrifices have to be made, and unfortunately you can't make sacrifices unless you love the one you are making those sacrifices to.|`|bc8c015b33127f191c20bfa4329d27e0aa	In such a situation the priority should be the kids, this is not to oppress the husband's desires but he is responsible for his kids and oppressing them just to meet his own desires is not fair I think.<br>  <br>  So depending on how he feels real love towards that other woman and depending on his relationship with his wife, he should take his decision.<br>  <br>  i.e. if his relation with his wife is so deteriorated that they cannot go on their life together, which is not the case here I guess as I understand from your question, and at the same time he knows very well he really loves the other woman, so he may leave his wife and marry that other woman, but with ensuring not to let his kids be affected in any way by this.<br>  <br>  Otherwise if this is just a caprice, so he should leave it at once and continue his life with his family, he may refresh their life together, e.g. going to a long, new journey, make something new in his life....etc so he touches a renovation to his life, sometimes it's just a boredom of routine life.|`|hiKtjrWNaa	very complicated indeed...<br>  well i'm a married woman so i can understand it a bit.. <br>  in my opinion he sacrifice his (love) for that other woman and  try to make it up for his family whom doesn't deserve such treatment..<br>  <br>  after all, u said that he and she didn't love each other before marriage..lets see.. what about sharing a home? good moments, bad ones? pregnancy? giving birth? having a kid? watching them grow up? i call this love.. he should love his family and wife... cause they deserve it..<br>  <br>  BUT if his wife is understandable, always fighting him, doenst feel the value of him and turning his life into living hell and he can't just bear it, then he better leave her in  a good way...

70169fb4925a4cff614639692b3cd20baa	You didn't mention from which country you are departing and which city you're going to land. You also didn't mention which airline you're going to take. As there are several airlines flying to Australia from very different cities abroad I can't give you an answer. I need to know more details.<br>  Didn't you have a look at the times when you were booking? I suppose you booked online, didn't you? <br>  Anyway, without further details such as airline, departure time, and the place where you departure from there is no good answer possible.<br>  <br>  And yes, it might be a little boring, mostly at the end of the flight because you can't sit any longer and you don't know which part of your bum hurts more - left or right one.<br>  Flight attendants are very kind and friendly and you get enough to eat depending on time of departure dinner/snack/breakfast or lunch/snack/dinner. It also depends on airline.<br>  If you like you can contact me via Yahoo and I can tell you more but please give more details.|`|23fe729840a0e15dbc1476704bdf1dfeaa	You don't say where you are coming from or what airline you are flying? I'm assuming Qantas? <br>  The flight its self is pretty non inventful unless you hit turbulence. And, depending on the airline you use, the air hostesses should look after you pretty well but remember to be polite and couteous! <br>  You should get each of your required meals and snacks and drinks. Feel free to take your own snacks/drinks on board but just remember if you don't eat certain snacks like fruit or vegies you will have to leave them on board as they won't get through Australias strict quarantine.<br>  I flew Sydney to london last year and we got dinner, supper, breakfast and then a light lunch right before landing.<br>  I can never sleep on coach which is why I get bad jet lag. My friend I travelled with however has no issues so it depends what kind of sleeper you are. Take an inflatable neck rest on board, ear plugs and eye mask just in case. <br>  Hopefully you will get a plane with movie screens on the seat in front of you so you will have a choice of over 200 movies Tv show and music to watch/listen too if you can't sleep. But pack a puzzle book if you like. Its also a good idea to have something to read novel wise. <br>  Most flights rely on the clock at your point of departure until right before you land when they inform you of the local time. Eg. If you take off at 8pm from London they will serve your meals & let you sleep as if you were still in London until you begin descent to Australia.<br>  <br>  I hope you have a lovely time in Australia! I lived in Melbourne for 5 years and it was AWESOME!!|`|EJpiaCMQaa	The flight is boring.  It's dark most of the flight until near landing.  They give you enough food so you won't go hungry.  The food was good.   I flew on United Airlines and they did a good job keeping up with everybody.  I don't know about you, but I can never sleep on an airplane.  Plus, it's too exciting to sleep going to Australia!  The flight had some turbulence, but nothing major.  It's really the same as being on any other flight, just much longer duration.  That morning before we landed, the flight attendants handed out warm towels for everyone to clean up.  When we did land, the Australian agricultural department came on board to spray the plane.  They are very serious about keeping diseases out of their country.  Everybody is still on board the plane when they spary.  It's no big deal and didn't bother anybody.  I don't know where in Australia you are going, but Sydney and Melbourne are very nice places to visit.  The people are very friendly and it's so much fun.|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	if your flying qantas the service and food are excellent<br>  i wouldn't fly with anyone else|`|48SKEteeaa	I will assume you are flying from west coast USA to Sydney or Brisbane.<br>  Yes, the flight is long. Very long indeed. I find all long haul flights boring and I dislike them but there is nothing you can do about it. I can never sleep on aircraft but you might consider getting a sleeping tablet from your doctor before you leave. I never take them and just put up with the lack of sleep. Everyone is different. Most people can sleep on the plane and you might be one of those people.<br>  <br>  LA to Australia flights are at the limit of an aircraft's range but completely safe in that regard. The usual aircraft for this flight is Boeing 747/400. If you are flying Qantas their in-flight service is notoriously poor. However the USA / Australia route is extremely profitable for the airline so you will have a better chance of receiving close to decent service on your flight. The experience on United is usually much better. It remains to be seem what the new service from V Australia is like. They fly new Boeing 777s.<br>  <br>  You will skip a day because you cross the international date line. It will not be dark for most of the flight.<br>  <br>  Have a good time!
dai4nP0yaa	Well, some sell all kinds of weird cannabis inspired products, but normal coffeeshops  simply sell a number of types of weed and hash and a selection of space-cakes (marijuana cakes) or space-cookies. They are usually graded on potency but if not, you can always ask the guys in the coffeeshop to give you an idea how strong each product is. You can choose to smoke it there or take it with you. Virtually all coffeeshops have a menu, so when you walk in just ask for a menu (It might be nice to say dag/hoi or hello first). They also often sell coffee tea and some soft drinks (no alcohol). With the new anti-smoking laws you can't smoke tobacco in a coffeeshop, but most coffeeshops offer some sort of mixed herb thing if you prefer not to smoke a pure joint. Oh yeah, almost forgot, by law you cannot buy more than 5 gms per day (ofcourse you can just go from one coffeeshop to another) but 5 gms really is more than enough even for heavy smokers. They sell pre-rolled joints as well. Final word of advice. Don't walk around Amsterdam stoned out of your mind, it's not very nice to Amsterdammers, and ofcourse there's the risk of theives, getting lost or getting hit by a tram. <br>  There are a number of websites that give a comprehensive guide to the coffeeshop scene|`|PCpMqpP3aa	when you go in there is usually a menu of the different types of pot you can buy like skunk or haze which is the strongest type of grass they sell currently, or the different resins homemade dutch stuff is the best like iceolator but this is very expensive. you can buy ready made joints or space cakes. some coffeeshops have vapourisers you can use which doesn't burn the weed it just heats it up to a temperature where fumes are given off, much healthier. most coffeeshops also have an area that is partitioned off from the serving staff where you can smoke joints with or without tobacco. most coffeeshops don't serve alcohol, except some of the bigger ones in amsterdam but here the bar is usually on a different floor to where they sell the weed. the quality in the tourist traps like the grasshopper or the bulldog in amsterdam isn't that great but its probably better than what you are used to. <br>  enjoy|`|AA11705909	You can smoke dope in them but as Holland has stopped tobacco smoking indoors, you cannot have to baccy in the joints you smoke. You ask to see the price list and choose from that. You cannot go in if you are under 18, they will throw you out. They will lose their licence if they serve anyone underage.|`|5vFGO57Kaa	Smoke big reefers and get wasted!!<br>  <br>  They sell all different types of weed, so basically you go in and buy what you fancy.|`|wnrRXbFCaa	They sell marijuana. You go in, look at the menu, pick what you want, pay, and then smoke.|`|13561ef688d651ebae907f5ff2f7fc41aa	Get on with your homework and concern yourself with issues related to your age please.|`|MEFqyg0Oaa	Cannibas things? really? wow.<br>  <br>  Ok, the way these places work: It's sorta like a bar.  You walk in, go up to the bar, where they serve shitty coffee, and they will more than likely have several different kinds of weed, and wraps on sale.  There is a place right next to a big church if you walk straight out of the Amsterdam central train station.  It's right on the main drag.  I went there right when I got to Holland cause it was the first place I saw.  They literally had little bags of like 8 different kinds of weed on a board, hung on little hooks.  They usually sell it in like grams and eigths.  So you buy, sit down, twist one up and burn.  <br>  <br>  They know why you're there, it's not like the people that work there are actually Dutch.  Most Dutch people don't even smoke.  Most people in the Red Light District are Rastafarians, or other people who immigrated to sit around and get baked all day. So you just really gotta walk up and point.  Plus, almost everyone in Holland speaks perfect english anyways, so it's not like there's a communication barrier.|`|IgNADy1Taa	They sell different types of weed and hash. There's normally a counter, on which there will be a menu listing all the different types the particular coffeeshop stocks. You can check it out (it often says what type of high the weed produces - e.g. light, very stoned, chilled) and it will say how much it costs for a bag (e.g. 1.7g  €10) or a pre-rolled joint of that particular weed (around €3 but it really depends because some are extra-long!) There might also be a section for just pre-rolled joints...which might be called just general 'wiet' (but then ask what type of weed they use in it, normally skunk/superskunk) or even mixed hash and weed. In the bags it's all quite compacted together so you'll have to spend awhile crushing it and then rolling etc so if you're inexperienced it might be good to have a pre-rolled, although these are often not that strong. They are also generally always mixed with tobacco, and with the new smoking ban you are not allowed to smoke tobacco joints indoors anymore so you will have to find a place outside if the coffeeshop has a terrace or tables on the stoop (or roll a pure one inside). You can't just wander around the city smoking a joint. I mean you can, but you can't if you know what I mean. I wouldn't risk p*ssing off the pedestrians and getting admonished by the police. <br>  <br>  The people behind the counter are normally very friendly and helpful, assuming you are of-age (often they ID you) so you can ask what type of weed they recommend - the particular coffeeshop might have their own special concoction (I love "Betty's Blueberry" from Betty Too's) and will normally tell you what sort of high to expect. The type of high you get will depend on whether the strain is indica or sativa and how much of each is in the weed (White Widow is one of the most popular kinds in Holland and it is 60% indica and 40% sativa. If I smoke a lot, I get very stoned indeed.) <br>  <br>  The amount on offer will depend on the coffeeshop, but generally they will stock the most popular kinds which are White Widow, some type of Haze (e.g. Silver Haze), AK47 and Superskunk. And hash. <br>  <br>  Inside it might look just like any other coffee shop/cafe..cosy tables, sofas etc. You can sit there and roll, or smoke what you've ordered there and it's advisable to order a drink or something from them as well. Any weed you smoke should've been purchased there and not elsewhere!<br>  <br>  Coffeeshops also offer a range of drinks like fizzy drinks, orange juice, water and chocolate milk, but no alcohol because weed + alcohol can be a recipe for disaster (at least if consumed in that order, with me! The other way around is fine). Often there are little snacks you can get, like M & Ms and chocolate bars like Mars's and Twixes. <br>  <br>  There will also be papers for sale, and tippy-booklets full of hard paper in the perfect shape for rolling a roach. There may be lighters and weed crushers and other weed paraphernalia. Often if you've bought a bag, you can just take a paper or two for free if they have loose ones on the counter.<br>  <br>  Rumour has it that some stock ecstasy pills but they are of course illegal in Holland so there is no point in asking for that over the counter and looking like an idiot.

But you could either rent a kennel at the airport from the airline you are flying with, which will cost around $50 and he will go underneath. OR, instead of putting him underneath, you could rent a kennel and buy a seat for him next to you.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	I have never heard of any college or university that will allow pets in the dorms...you sure better ask before bringing your dog to the U.S.|`|86ea0f606c4289ae57db03fa34a6da0aaa	Check with the airline because they all seem to have their own policy. For example Delta will transport a dog for $200, American will do it for $100. Things get crazy when you fly a dog into Europe because of the Pets Travel Scheme which means a dog has to go as cargo and can cost upwards of $2000.
lys5kB9Daa	Well, the phoenix area in general is a nice place to live but i personally dont like Scottsdale. It's really expensive to live and it's a lot of snobby people who have boob jobs and say my bmw is better yours. basically its mini LA.   but surrounding areas like north phoenix, chandler, peoria are really nice (i live in north phoenix). he is right about mountains and desert- i am from boston so i find the land here pretty ugly and boring and i miss grass. but it's also cool to have so many mountains to go hiking at and it's always better driving in rush hour traffic looking at palm trees rather than snow and dead trees lol.  southern california in my opinion is the same thing only 3 times the price. i have friends who moved here from san diego and pay less for their 4 bedroom house then they paid there for a studio apartment. and the ocean is only a 5 hour drive so you can go there for the weekend no problem!|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	the only plus side to living in scottsdale is that you're not living in camp verde! lol

GqRNBTV9aa	Well, no you can't cover the whole country in 5 days. If you are seriously interested in sightseeing a year in Greece would not be enough.     Greece is not a massive  country but it is not that small either and if you wanted to see different types islands -greek islands vary greatly- then you'd need a lot of time.    Still there are a lot of interesting things you can do in 5 days. I would agree with the previous answerer that you should spend at least a couple of days in Athens -Akropolis, Cape Sounio, Plaka district and the National Archeological Museum (one of the greatest museums of classical antiquities in the world are all highly recommended).     There is a new Acropolis Museum now that is very highly acclaimed and it worths taking a look. Also you can check the panoramic view of Athens by going up on Lycabettus mountain (there is a cableway).     Athenians love the Kolonaki district which is the most fashionable area in Athens. I think it presents little interest for tourists but you might want to have a coffee in Kolonaki Sq. and feel a true Athenian. It is very centrally located -just 10 minutes from Syntagma Sq. so it won't be out of your way.    There are many more things to do in Athens but I think those are the basics.     I think tourists generally don't spent as much time as it would worth it in mainland Greece. There are a lot of fascinating areas of Great Historical and Archaeological interest, byzantine Churches and monasteries etc. Meteora, Agamemnon's tombs, Epidaurus, Philipus (Alexander the Great's father) tomb etc are amongst the most popular.     Then about islands there is a great variety. Mykonos is promoted as a party island, it gets a lot of tourism -more or less the same kind of people as Ibiza: party crowds.    Crete is the biggest Greek island and it has a bit of everything: natural landscapes, Archeological sites, beautiful beaches and the healthiest cuisine in the world -and in my humble opinion the tastier and I have travelled a lot.    Santorini is also very popular, the whole island is a volcano and the villages are build around it so it is quite unique. It is long trip from Athens, I would suggest that if you travel to Crete or Santorini to do an overnight trip either wise you are going to loose your precious days on ships.    And there are many other islands and things to see. I just added here some ideas without knowing your interests or your tastes.    Have fun! I wish I had the time to take a holiday in Greece now.|`|BWxSSADaaa	I visited Greece and London in 2006.  It really depends on what you want to see.  I think that for just Athens, you can do a couple of days.  If you want to see a few islands, or more of the mainland, I personally would devote more than 5 days because it's a beautiful country.      What I did was spend 2 days in Athens and saw the typical tourist stuff there.  Go to the Acropolis first--it really is amazing--with your ticket from the Acropolis you'll get tickets to other attractions for free.  Go early in the morning, and expect a little bit of a climb.    After spending time in Athens, I headed to Milos.  That was a last minute decision; I knew I wanted to go to an island in the Cyclades, but didn't decide on which one till the last minute.  I had originally planned on spending a couple of days there, then hopping to another island (there are frequent ferries).  But I liked it, and it was just so relaxing there, that I stayed a week, then back to Athens for overnight, then home.    Obviously, there is more to do than relax on the beach.  There are several islands with interesting historical attractions, and on top of that there is the mainland.  I personally will go back to Greece for another trip, 10 days was not enough!|`|I3CNklLKaa	I think it's an exellent plan to come from both Greece and Morocco. The best time to come is at half past three - you can see the whole of Greece in 5 days. If you do come separately I would send your legs over first and the rest later.|`|FCEWq5zqaa	5 days maybe enough for seeing the islands. i heard of such med tours.  but definatly go there sepratly if you want to cover more area. 10 days will be ideal.   Have fun!

Michael|`|5YPh5RXPaa	Tab3an he should treat her by preparing breakfast, and lunch and dinner too!  The trick is that you ask him to do it during your honeymoon, and then when the honeymoon is over, he would be embarrassed not to do it. Step by step, it becomes a family tradition!  Lol|`|AA11152480	yes, and not only for the weekend, doesn't she do this - and more she prepares his the 3 meals & taking care for the house and babies & sometimes she is working just like him- almost every day for him ?  this increase the romance and sometimes women can see this more beautiful than an expensive gift.  but that doesn't mean she will sacrifice the gift for the breakfast :)|`|KijGRGXuaa	good idea to share his wife when possible|`|9R8uYHcPaa	my wife is gona be so lucky ..|`|hhhk499qaa	it doesn't need to be on weekends only  he can prepare the breakfast for her whenever he can  that's what you call a husband|`|r6SL1pJaaa	Of cooooourse... when I have a weekend I sure will

FXaHv4lgaa	Start by saving money to travel and figuring how you can make money on the way.  A friend of mine went on a college program to Italy, and then began living in Italy giving English lessons.  From a Eurpean country, you could take the train to many many other countries, and get used to being abroad in a relatively safe way.    I'd also start to learn a language other than English, something that has may speakers around the world, such as Spanish or Chinese.|`|QkPS8QCJaa	You definately need to save money first...  But Traveling can be fun in your own state as well as country. Take a map and mark all the places you want to go, in the United States, grab some friends and take a road trip after Graduation and see those sites.   Then move on to bigger things as you save more money, I would agree with the Europe comment. There are so many places you can go in Europe by simply hoping on a train. I would say vist Australia and New Zealand as well... BEAUTIFUL!!!!!    Good Luck, and Happy Traveling!!!!|`|fJ1GQLNEaa	take tour lessons and visit neighboring states or countries|`|S9F5rzBqaa	I'm in a similar place as you.

That should be very fun. Have fun and wear whatever you like fashion is a form of art that comes to life. Have a great day!!|`|n8RdkOz7aa	go back to pittsburgh then!|`|60b2a2e456bb4fd7ccdb247a79ff9c92aa	"I go to school at the univ. Miami" ("we moved to LA in august")  the students of the univ, OF miami refers to uni.v of miami  as UM.(never use univ.miami).    "You HAVE to get all the designer stuff to fit in" ......the people in Miami never try to "fit in" THEY ARE!!!  not arrogance ,it is just self confidence...    "how can I stay true to my self? this seems so easy but trust me....when ur surrounded by IT ,it ain't easy!!! AHH,Help?"  I don't understand it ....,do You dream of Miami?    in the final "idk .to each his own i suppose"   that is a conffesion ,of the slip of mind,You are from LA and You have never been in Miami.
ULreFc0maa	First of all...   If your a beatles fan check out loads of the places you can visit like John Lennons childhood house (I live near there!)   Everyone says how cool it is and i think its quite cool too.    Liverpool FC tickets can be purshased at the ticket office at the ground i think  . Also on the website =]     Erm.. A 3 star hotel ? Check out http://www.hotels.com    Nightlife? In liverpool there is alot of that lol. A good club is "Mood"   The nightlife can be tacky sometimes, but it depends where you go.     Places you have ABSOULUTELY GOT TO visit:  The town centre  The liver buildings  Liverpool One Shopping center  LFC ground (duh)  John lennons house  The Albert Dock - go on the duck bus ride!! You get to go in the sea, and on the ground!! its a car and a boat. wow.     Try the "magical mystery tour" aswell .|`|DdNAqWulaa	Getting a match ticket could be tricky as most games sell out pretty quickly and very few go on to "general sale"  THe Canadian branch of the Liverpool supporters club may well have tickets of their own or at least be able to point you in the right direction.  Failing that you're probably either going to have to end up paying way over the odds to a tout at the ground  or going on an arranged package - there are a number of firms that will do accomodation and a match ticket.  Hotels I'd probably plump for the city centre.   Crowne Plaza,  Marriott, Thistle, Radisson   (and by then the Hilton will be open)  Jurys  hotels all fairly good and central. City centre is easy to walk around.  As well as the footy (Anfield museum is a must then)  there are the 2 cathedrals,  several museums and galleries,  Albert Dock,  Shopping Centre, and all the expected Beatles stuff. Theatres, have a good programme usually too.  Nightlife centres round the Albert Dock bars,  Cavern Quarter  and  Concert Square/Slater Street areas.   Find a bar with music and girls you like and fill yer boots.

bgQP1Aquaa	the eucalyptus tree was brought over from australia sometime around the 1870 because of their potential to dry out swampland.they were used in the hula valley north of the kinneret lake.they did very well and were used all over israel,along many main roads to provide shade.they are beautiful and part of the landscape.
eyJqrqn7aa	Not a new thing and shouldn't be such a surprise to the world.  It is happening in other places right now.  The communists did it in Nam 40 years ago.  It was one of my jobs to keep a count in local villages of the young men.  When the numbers grew we knew the Cong was hiding in the village.  I shot several.  Never felt bad about it either.  Once established the people were told to haul *** and the village burned to the ground.  The so called atrocities of this small short skirmish are nothing compared to all out war.  If you don't want war make peace.  It wouldn't be that hard.  Just leave the Jews alone and stop promising to kill them all.|`|YilXDO4Zaa	Not really nice, but at least they admit it.  In fact they seem proud of it.  No decent warrior would hide behind his own children.  He would rather give up his own life to protect them.

After all, they are a civilized nation, yes?|`|nHuMeLtyaa	In reality, they use what they have available.  I'll bet that they would rather use a tank to hide behind, but they don't have any.|`|MHkx2kRTaa	They are only admitting what has been known for years.    Hamas could not care less about the population and will use any way possible to promote their cause including killing children.    Children have been sent into Israel as suicide bombers by Hamas.    Hamas is a terrorist organisation and part of the Muslim Brotherhood who would love to take over the world if they could.    I hope the UN charges Hamas with war crimes and crimes against humanity.     It is a pity that the death penalty is not used in the Hague where war crimes are tried. Hamas has been responsible for the death penaly on many of its citizens.|`|XuYPddLuaa	No. I hate the fact that they use human shields. It disgusts me. That's why the IDF does, too.     At least Hamas admits it.|`|RnLbJpvTaa	yeah its not very nice.    its not very nice when the IDF does it either    http://www.amnesty.org/en/for-media/pres...    Our sources in Gaza report that Israeli soldiers have entered and taken up positions in a number of Palestinian homes, forcing families to stay in a ground floor room while they use the rest of their house as a military base and sniperf position, said Malcolm Smart, Amnesty Internationals Middle East and North Africa Programme. This clearly increases the risk to the Palestinian families concerned and means they are effectively being used as human shields.|`|Ugb8MvFJaa	Not as nice as it would be if the ZionFUCKERS admit to all the broken laws they've committed and all the lies they've told the world!

IjbFXj2xaa	The Ecuadorian consulate will ask for proof of intent to leave, which is usually in the form of a return ticket.    However, the likelihood of being asked to provide the same proof when you actually enter is virtually nil (i have entered Ecuador more than a dozen times, receiving a visa at the immigration booth and *never* been asked to present evidence.)

I think you need a strong and Healthy balance where yuo are recognised as a parent, but you can talk and be a friend to ur child when they need it.<br>  <br>  As a child growing up, my mum was so focussed on being my friend and fitting in with me and my friends. I guess being the 'cool' mum that it caused me problems with knowing my boundaries and when to say no and step back. Because of this I think I lost a lot of respect for her, as it was cool and fun to have such a youngish mum who was friends with my friends. But as I got older and when she left and by the way she did it i realised the mistakes I made and the way my life took me I resented it. <br>  <br>  My dad hit the balance perfectly, although he wasnt there a lot of my childhood, he worked very hard. We feared him and respected him but we knew if we ever wanted to talk about ANYTHING we could with him. we knew he loved us more than life itself, which is important. I never wanted to disrespect or do something I knew would hurt my dad because of the bond we shared.<br>  <br>  I just wish he had a better involvement from an earlier age lolz. <br>  <br>  I hope I take the best and worse from both parents and build on that when I have children of my own, inshaa Allah.

Another good trick is  to engage them in activities that they can share with you, like outings, sports, mashaweer (bas mesh mashaweer el mechanicy!!) and during these outings, they should be responsible for things so that they get the feeling that they are important and that they are needed and that they have grown up and that you can depend on them. <br>  At the same time, give them harmless space.

Being parents is not only allow them to do things that another kids do.........or allow them to go out till 3 am.<br>  Being parents is to think about their future...their dreams....their life when they leave the parents' house.<br>  That's why in my humble opinion, the rol of the parents cant be the rol of friends.<br>  I'm not meaning that parents cant share some interests with their kids...as to play football together...go to fish....go out together for a pizza or to have dinner, but, we cant never forget out rol of parents.<br>  Friends are friends...........and parents are parents.<br>  Parents are there to support.......to help...to educate... and to prepare them to be themselves when they grow up. To punish a kid when he/she deserves it......is not a bad thing. All of us learnt from our parents in different ways, bcoz we lived in different moments, and generations are different. But some punishments are act of love.<br>  I have an excellent relationship with my sons nowadays, although I'm "crashing" with the elder one so often, but is not bcoz we dont love each other, but bcoz we are so much similar to each other.<br>  I have a story about my younger son. I'll tell it to you, and I should like to hear what all of you think about it.<br>  When he was finishing his secondary school...all the group was thinking to go to Florianopolis ( a beach city in Brazil). He told me in april what they were thinking....and I agreed. But I put conditions.<br>  He would go IF the subjects that could be exonerated, were exonerated in september (when they were thinking to travel to Brazil)<br>  he had enough time............and his only responsibility was to study.<br>  In july, I asked him about the 3 subjects and he replied...Oh mom...that is easy !!!<br>  I didnt say anything<br>  August passed and I didnt ask again........and september arrived.<br>  When all the classmates were  getting their permission to travel he came and asked me to sign his, allowing him to travel outside our country. So...i asked about the subjects..and he said..."well..arent exonerated yet, but they are easy "!!<br>  Ok I replied...It was very easy for you to do what I asked many months ago, but you didnt do it.<br>  You havent been responsible with the only thing you had to do....so.......you have to learn to be responsible and that each thing has the own prioritiy.<br>  I didnt allow him to go to the trip.........and till now he is making me feel guilty abt that. But till now, i think that i did what was correct.<br>  I did that bcoz i love him.<br>  He is a responsible person in his life and work now...I dunno if what i did helped...but I like to think that it did,|`|FNCohXNiaa	although i am not a mum or dad, from a teenager's point of view, its important that you become friends with your kids.its the best way, like you said.and the way to keep that friendship is by hanging out and doing things together that are fun:parks, pizza, etc, ask them where THEY would like to go and for example, have a "family day" on each friday of the week for example and that would be the day you all go out together each week.leave the other days for their friends or for work.dont put lots of limits and rules, but when u do, make sure u explain to them exactly why, and so, they would understand.<br>  unlike my father for example, he used to impose so many rules and restrictions on me, its was unbelievable, and some of them were very obscure i never knew what was the point, and i never knew because he never told me!so he was never really close to me as a result of all that.<br>  so as i said, hang out together, do activities together, and because u already trust your kids and they trust you then u will be ok!<br>  take care corner :)|`|hhhk499qaa	I will give them some independence and at the sem time take a lot of care about them.|`|5Zi1uaEYaa	my kids still kids not teens but believe me we are friends the issue is to try to wear them shoes once i was teens and i can feel them felling i can give them trust but watch from far far far away just from time to time just to feel safe that they will pass it safely cause its not easy to pass teenage safely this era in our life affect our whole life so don't be too free and not too much tricked be wise  and watch from outside and wear them shoes
4d4613345361adbff18fa527cb3c06c7aa	I assume you have the GDP for last year. Let's also assume the growth rate is 5%. Then multiply the current GDP by 1.05. The answer would be the GDP for one year in the future. For four years in the future, keep multiplying the last result by 1.05 (or whatever the growth rate) three more times.  Each time you multiply would give you one more year. Just make sure that you use the previous year's result in order to get the next.    Good luck!
PA0bGBtCaa	I've answered your same question about two weeks ago :).  No, Spirit is not a "good" airline. Their planes are crammed with as many people they can legally stuff on board, but their fares are super cheap. Don't look for much in the way of customer service as they pay very little and they treat their employees like crap.    Bring a dental kit too. Because when the person in front of you reclines their seat, you'll be able to do some dental work on them becuase their head will be in your lap! I've flown on them many of times and hated ever experience.
HziXc5Ovaa	Yes, family holidays are amazing in Cuba. I will recommend Cayo Coco at the Tryp Cayo Coco Resort. It's all-inclusive and is a great place. The people that work there and the quality of the resort is fabulous. It's a great place for all ages and families. It's easy to relax and just chill or be busy with lots of different activities.  Cuba is great because the people are great. If you go you will most likely be going back again and again.   Cayo Coco resorts are only a 15 minute drive from the airport which makes it easy after a plane ride if there are older ones and children in the group.    Hopefully you'll be able to go. It'll be an amazing experience.    http://search.live.com/images/results.as...  http://www.solmelia.com/solNew/hoteles/j...  http://www.solmelia.com/solNew/hoteles/j...  http://www.solmeliacuba.com/cuba-hotel/t...|`|CZwJJetyaa	If your American and you don't have family in Cuba, you do know that there is an embargo and you can be fined when you get back...

It was probably the best family holiday I've ever had so I'd definitely recommend it!|`|RhkKGsipaa	Cuba is perfect for a family holiday the resorts offer activities to fit all age groups.The beaches are terrific, the scenery fantastic, there's no shortage of activities to keep you going day and night.  Cubans  are proud of their country, they  welcome visitors with open arms and will treat  you like visiting royalty.   A wonderful benefit, a great culture and no McDonald's or time share salesman. Chances are if you   go once you will return again and again.  Check the sites below they contain tons of information.  My favorite resort is Sol Melia Rio Luna y Mares.  you will see it in the links below.

pNxuvKUOaa	I don't know much about Charlton in particular, but I know it is in Saratoga County.  The area is as a whole somewhat rural- there aren't any really big cities in the county, even Mechanicsville is rather sleepy. Saratoga Springs is very active during tourist season but quiet otherwise. One thing- if you want to do shopping expect to do some driving, there aren't supermarkets and shopping centers in every town- but on the bright side you can usually get to anything you need in a half hour tops.    Last- I wouldn't say Charlton is exactly near Albany, it's at least an hour away., but a reasonably easy commute on Rt 87|`|ElLSCJpwaa	Well, i say, go up there and have a good look about, get your husbands sister and mum to show you around a litlle bit, and get to know the place a little better.    Then, once you have an idea what it is like, compare it to where you live now, better or worse,     Then if your not sure you could do some research, go onto google and type in stuff like charlton, NY    good luck!
VT8L1G2Eaa	Yes they do, and they keep rolling over every year. However, Airtmiles have recently contacted members who have not had any miles credited to their account in the last two years that they will forfeit any accrued miles soon. All members have to do to avoid this is to get one airmile credited to their account before the deadline. I have just booked a flight using my Airmiles that I have been saving for over eight years. Apparently Airmiles are getting concerned because they have millions of Airmiles in dormant accounts.|`|AA11496012	Depending on the airline, your miles should not expire if you keep your account active, meaning you are adding miles or redeeming your miles for a free trip.
6d920711f9f980a9e93a140db57c7709aa	One of my co-workers recently stayed at the Grand Californian Hotel & Spa with his girlfriend and he said it was the first time in a long time where they didn't argue about something at least once a day.  Sounds romantic enough to me. It really is a beautiful hotel, has great restaurants and is located conveniately to the parks and Downtown Disney.|`|cxNLOPHNaa	As the others have mentioned... The Grand Californian is also my first choice. But since it's a Disney hotel, it's also very expensive compared to the inns around Disneyland.  <a href="http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyland/en_US/hotels/landing?name=GrandCalifornianHotelLandingPage&bhcp=1" rel="nofollow">http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyla...</a><br>  <br>  If you don't mind staying just outside the Disney complex... Then my recommendations are-<br>  <br>  The Candy Cane Inn<br>  <a href="http://www.candycaneinn.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.candycaneinn.net/</a><br>  <br>  The Annabella Hotel<br>  <a href="http://www.anabellahotel.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.anabellahotel.com/</a><br>  <br>  Of the two mentioned above. The Candy Cane Inn is just outside Disney's California Adventure and a short walk to the main entrance. The Annabella is literally across the street from Disney's California Adventure, on Katella. But, it's a bit of a trek to the main entrance since the main entrance to the Disney parks is on Harbor Blvd. I'd say about 15 minutes walk, depending on the crowds of other tourists.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	As Muppet mentioned, the Grand Californian. <br>  <br>  Mrs. Obviousman and I go there about once a year for a little romantic getaway. Try to get a Downtown Disney view room or a room with a view of California Adventure. Romantic moments include:<br>  <br>  -Sitting by the fireplace in the lobby listening to the piano player.<br>  -Lounging by the huge pool<br>  -Swimming in the pool<br>  -Sitting on the balcony overlooking Downtown Disney, listening to the street performers (especially the violin player)<br>  -Take a stroll through Downtown Disney. <br>  -Enjoying a wonderful dinner in Napa Rose or Storyteller Cafe<br>  <br>  Muy Romantico!|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	Disneyland - romantic... don't really go together.<br>  The Grand California Hotel at Disneyland is suppose to be a 4-star but I don't think it would be considered romantic.  And the Napa Rose inside the hotel is suppose to be fantastic too.  A lot of locals go there.<br>  <br>  The Hilton Huntington Beach is about 15-20min from Disneyland and a super nice hotel overlooking the ocean.
q7z7Ni3Daa	I didn't choose to go =) rather it was emergency. I also have medical care on a regular basis here. I suppose it depends on what you are comparing it to. Compared to US medical prices, my stay was practically free. The facilities are horrible, the equipment is adequate or better, the doctors (that I have encountered) were excellent if often abrupt, and the other medical staff was anywhere from sit-on-their-butt all-day tea drinkers to the best I've ever had.    One suggestion is to research your particular medical problem as far as which hospital is best. It really matters here, much more so than any country I have been in. Specialization is important. For example,   Cerrahpasa's rheumatology department is excellent, and the treatment is the latest available.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	Turkey is great for laser eye surgery treatment. There are specialists over there and many people, even from Western Europe, go to Turkey for such treatment.    There are other medical treatments in Turkey with very high standards. The prices are usually much cheaper than in Western European countries.     However, you have to know if the particular medical care you are looking for is of good quality in a particular hospital. A lot of things work that way in Turkey: Food, bars & clubs, doctors, interior designers or whatever you want.|`|YnzyFP23aa	This country looks more like a cemetery than an hospital
hMTL2AV7aa	in short Sudan and Egypt used to be one country , French & British came and occupied , gave Sudan independence as they claim. The term "Sudan" is a geographical term in old Arabic documents describing all sub-saharan African region , across the continent to Timbuktu , not just the area now known as Sudan, but the British narrowed it to Sudan the country.  Reference British & Egyptian foreign correspondence from that time.|`|RILZcr6Daa	Through the Big Bang Theory|`|PQ9HMdZDaa	a correction to the previous post- the term Sudan is not  geographical in its origins, it is actually one of the plurals for the arabic word 'black'.    Modern day Sudan, refering to the political borders of the country, was created in 1956 on January 1.      The British left Egypt in 1936 and Sudan remained under British occupation.  After the Egyptian revolution in 1952 the new leaders of Egypt including Gamal Abdel-Nasser wanted to limit British power in the region and signed a treaty with Britain in 1954 that ultimately led to Sudan's independence.

Also something you may want to do I did when I was there, you can go online and register for FREE tickets to go see a taping of Conan OBbrien show it is filmed at NBC there in the Plaza, and it is neat cause he always has celebs on there.

It's up to you if you want to believe that.

So, you get to go, yeah!
d8h5h8IVaa	It really depends upon where you go in Arizona, it's a big state with a lot of variations in weather that most people don't know about.    I used to live in Sedona Arizona, which can get chilly in January and February, but not anywhere near what one experiences on the east coast.  Phoenix is really hot most of the year, in February it's usually 75 degrees during the day and 45 to 55 degrees in the evening.  However, Flagstaff Arizona is extremely elevated, and gets a lot of snow, it's usually around 35 to 45 degrees during the day and in the 20's at night in February.    Basically southern AZ is warmer, while northern AZ is hotter.  If your going to the Grand Canyon or Flagstaff bring warm sweaters and a light jacket. If you're used to cold weather it won't be bad at all!  Phoenix is incredibly warm and dry, but most people wear sweaters at night, it is the desert, it gets chilly at night.    I recommend Sedona, its right in between Phoenix and Flagstaff and is GORGEOUS, look it up online, it's not a far drive from Phoenix or Flagstaff and it is truly beautiful, it has huge red rocks and amazing scenery, it gets 8 million tourists a year for a reason.    Have fun!!!|`|EevMUAqJaa	It'll be like spring weather in a temperate climate, which is where I live. I'd pack some capris and a jacket or a hoodie.

What you get is a stamp in your passport giving you 30 days visa free, and that will happen in Bangkok, Suvanaphum airport, And then as far as I know this still applies, you will then have to get transport to the domestic airport at Don Muang ( The old international airport ) to fly to Ubon|`|QPf6Z5eQaa	Yes you probably fly into Bangkok.    What you need to know though is that there is no such thing as a visa on arrival (it's an improper term). It is a visa exemption. You can only obtain a visa outside Thailand's borders.    This is important if you stay or plan on staying more than 30 days.    Also the 30 day rule has changed last year. If you fly to Thailand you will still get your 30 days but if you enter Thailand overland you will only be granted 15 days.    If you plan on staying longer than 30 days, get a visa in the country you are in now. Best would have been your home country but get a tourist visa, double or triple entry in the country where you are at if they have a Thai embassy.

KmTyREP9aa	In Sydney, Adams' Marble Bar is pretty unique.  If you want a bit of exercise you can walk across the top of Sydney Harbour Bridge.  The Queen Victoria Building is a beautifully restored example from the late 19th Century and worth a visit.  Go to the Sydney Opera House for the experience, it has fantastic accoustice,  The 'Rocks' should be on the list if only to say you went there.  Everyone has heard of Bondi, but it is worth taking the ferry to Manly to enjoy the beach there. but never swim in the smaller rivers which exit into Port Jackson.  It could be your last swim !   If you are into motor sport, Mount Panorama, Bathurst is a must and the Zig-Zag at Lithgow is for train buffs.  The towns west of the Great Dividing Range, Bathurst, Orange, Dubbo, Tamworth, Armidale etc. are all worth seeing.  You will see a completely different aspect of Australia and meet really nice people.  The 'Cosmopolitan Hotel' in Taylors Arm, Macksville is unique.  It is reputedly the pub referred to in Slim Dusty's song, The Pub With No Beer and may now be called that.  There is acomodation there and conveniently the hotel has its own brewery.  Further up the coast Byron Bay, (the most easterly point on the mainland) is noted for seeing wales close in to the land if natural history is your thing  Motels are inexpensive and prolific in NSW.  Finally if you are there on the first Tuesday in November go into any hotel (hotel is the word for pub in Australia) and join the party.  All Australia stops for a party on Gold Cup Day.  I don't know about tattooing though.  I thought it was a Maori speciality,  I suggest you have a stop-over in Auckland on the way and pop down to Rotorua.  I hope I have given you a few ideas, enjoy your trip.|`|AA11987898	Sydney- tons to see there, the harbour, bars, and beaches. The Blue Mountains are a few hours from Sydney and great to go to if you are into adventure sports (mountain climbing, abseiling, etc).

There is also some adventure stuff up in Cairns, like hot air balloons, rafting, skydiving, etc.     Good luck!|`|NyJeK6NSaa	Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Byron bay, and many other are places are good tourist attractions in Australia.

Jamaican creole is NOT ENGLISH, nor is it BROKEN ENGLISH!! it is a different language! it has it's own patterns of grammar, phonics etc separate and apart from english.  HOWEVER it is an "english" CREOLE meaning the contributing language is majorly English. this is because Britain was the last Colonizer in my country. we have elements of "Twi" (from west Africa) and "Spanish" in our Creole.     our creole is more pure (Basilectal) in some parts of Jamaica (places for example St. Elizabeth and Trelawney), and more mixed (Mesolectal) with English in other parts (for example Kingston and St. Andrew).     ACCENTS vary from place to place and this accent will affect BOTH languages, both English and Creole.     If you are speaking to someone and they realise you are an english speaker, Jamaicans will Code Switch, or try to, to the Standard English as best they can (lol. this is what we call "Twanging") so tha you will understand what they are saying.  (most jamaicans can speak comprehensive english so donot worry about miscommunication)     do not try to understand creole, it is rather simple and we use many english word bout our pronounciation is so different u will be lost.     for example "Tek Care".. if you heard it would think "Teh Kiyare" "Tekiare" or "Teki Air" lol.. its actually "Take Care". lol    Good Luck.. n Tek Care :D|`|44dcc209645e25a90756133f2c64c1e5aa	JAMAICANS speak ENGLISH but we also have a dialect that is called PATOIS|`|TrjiIiPHaa	patois or patwa

Highly Favored basically told you everything about our lovely island, all thats left is for you to come and enjoy! =]|`|lcj1AKt1aa	Barbados is a very beautiful place to visit with friendly people.  It is only 166 sq miles and has about 267,000 people.  It is the most easterly of the Caribbean islands.  I have compiled some information on Barbados for you. Kindly have a look at it.    Information on Barbados  A Barbados Briefing  Barbados is a coral island, pushed out of sea by volcanic activity in a far away time. On the West Coast of Barbados, coral shore beaches of fine white sand stretch along a blue-green sea. Coral reefs fringe the Barbados shoreline to provide excellent snorkeling and Scuba Diving. Along the East Coast a lively surf is blown briskly by the strong and constant trade winds and the waves pound against a rocky shore. The constant breeze of the trade winds gives Barbados a mild and pleasant tropical climate.    When you visit Barbados, you will see it is mostly a flat coral island with excellent beaches, but there are rolling hills and many deep ridges and gullies, with an interesting distribution of flora and fauna. Within the Barbados coral core there is a vast array of caves and underground lakes which provide an excellent supply of drinking water that is amongst the purest in the world. Geologically Barbados is unique, being actually two land masses that merged together over the years. This and other anomalies make this Caribbean Island quite phenomenal, and there are geological structures that you will find only in Barbados.  Barbados Expectation  Barbados is a very beautiful island, with lots of art, activities, night life, music, history and some of the best restaurants to be found anywhere. But what makes Barbados even more special, and the reason why so many visitors keep returning to the island year after year, is the people. Barbadians, called Bajans, are warm and friendly souls, always ready to greet you with a sincere smile. Barbadians make you feel welcome and special, in this lovely Caribbean Island. You will feel its your home and will want to come back again and again to Barbados: A unique Caribbean paradise, surprisingly sophisticated, friendly, fun and always Naturally Charming!    http://barbados.org/  Some all-inclusive resorts here including Almond Casuarina which is very near to the night life (St. Lawrence Gap). Included in this is the adult-hotel which is the Club and Spa.  http://www.almondresorts.com/    Alternatively there is the Crane Hotel which has one of the top 10 best beaches in the world.

Unless you happen to have a special skill someone there doesn't have. You should also realize these three countries are very different.

KS2OHXCRaa	You can plan your route like this (assuming you're from close to Scotland):    Edinburgh - Rome - [Vienna] - Prague - [Berlin] - Amsterdam - Paris - London - Edinburgh    The cities that I put in square brackets are potential stops that you can take along the route, if you so wish. I myself have done the same route before and these cities are really worth visiting.     For most part, train travel is the way to go, and I think it's better value to buy tickets for the different journeys yourself ahead of time online, rather than getting train passes which would be quite expensive.    Anyway, let's get started. You can fly from Edinburgh to Rome-Ciampino with Ryanair, and there's often good air ticket prices when travelling with Ryanair.     For Rome-Vienna Sudbahnhof your best option is by overnight train so you won't be spending expenses for accommodation that night while you get to travel at the same time. There's a direct EuroNight train for 99euro, and the journey takes about 13 hours. You can get ticket from the Trenitalia website.    From Vienna to Prague, the train journey is about 4 hours and if you book ahead online you can find ticket as cheap as 30euro one way, 2nd class. Ticket from OEBB website.    From Prague to Berlin, the train journey is about 5 hours and if you book ahead online on Bahn.de website, there's ticket as low as 19euro one way, 2nd class. (The Czech train website is terrible, so book using the German one, really.)    From Berlin to Amsterdam, the train journey is a little over 6 hours, and the lowest price of advance booking is as low as 39euro one way, 2nd class. Ticket from Bahn.    From Amsterdam to Paris, the train journey is about 4 hours, and ticket price is as low as 25euro one way, 2nd class. Ticket from Voyages-SNCF.    From Paris to London, take the Eurostar train that takes about 2 1/2 hours, with ticket bought in advance is as low as 66euro one way, 2nd class. Ticket from Voyages-SNCF.      With regards to accommodation, I usually use Hostelworld to book for hostel beds. I highly recommend Wombats chain of hostels in Austria/Germany (so for Vienna/Berlin, it's makes a good choice) and you can either book them directly from their website or from Hostelworld. Otherwise, the St Christopher's hostels are also great as a chain goes.|`|CZp3UdQdaa	Hi, if you want to travel Europe by train is a great option, for the longer trips you'll sleep on the train so save on hotels, but keep in mind that it is also more exhausting and takes longer!  I've traveled extensively Spain and Italy by train and the best advice I can give you about trenitalia is to never take the Inter City (code IC), it might be a little cheaper but it's the most uncomfortable train I've ever been on and during summer sometimes they oversell tickets so the whole train is a big mess...that's from my experience!  From Italy you can easily reach either Paris or Prague. Here are some sites that can help you plan your trip better: http://www.eurail.com and www.raileurope.com  But don't forget to check the sites for low cost tickets, even the full-service airlines offer good deals sometimes (especially during summer, if you book in advance!) www.edreams.com / www.tui.com / www.lastminute.com are all great.  Hope this helps!

High-speed train toilet attempts to eat Frenchman    RoTM Emergency services were on Sunday obliged to cut free a TGV passenger whose arm was swallowed by the high-speed train's sucking dunny, the BBC reports.    The unnamed 26-year-old victim - traveling from La Rochelle to Bordeaux - dropped his mobe into the bog and ill-advisedly attempted to retrieve it from the lav's depths. Cue a unsheduled two-hour stop for the train as firemen detached the unit, still clamped firmly to its victim's limb.    Shaken witness Benoit Gigou recounted: "He came out on a stretcher, with his hand still jammed in the toilet bowl, which they had to saw clean off."    This is the first reported incident of cantankerous crapper attack across the Channel, where the machine uprising has until now relied on mephistophelean motors to do its dirty work.

AA12095483	A difficult question. There have been numerous projects to house some of the homeless, but some simply do not want to live indoors. Others refuse accommodation because they have to leave their carts outside - and those carts contain all their worldly goods. To most eyes, it looks like a pile of junk, but they are personal belongings and each of the homeless has something that he or she wishes to cling to.   The main problem was that closing Riverview and sending people with mental problems out to live on their own, was simply not the right move. Initially, they were supposed to live in group homes, but they soon moved out of those homes to live independently, and they were not mentally capable of looking after themselves. And so, they became homeless. Can they be returned to Riverview, or a similar institution?   Probably not. They cherish their freedom, just as you and I do.   Another sector is the number of young people - mostly runaways - who are into the drug culture. Homelessness suits them and they will stay in that condition until they get off drugs or die. A grim choice, but that's what it amounts to.   Looking after the homeless is one of the most frustrating problems facing 'do gooders' in Vancouver.|`|l4pVsxoraa	Simple, send all the street bums back to Ontario where they came from.|`|32ae3644d1b4faf4df296639803a0433aa	good question?those idiots in parliment rather rant like kids then help the weak|`|uHs6VSmjaa	Its a bit of a trickle-down effect. There is not nearly enough affordable housing in the city. At the higher end of the scale, if families and other middle income folks could buy houses and move out of rental housing or family housing co-ops, it would free up homes for those who now live in lower-end rental accomodation. That housing would then be more available to the homeless.    The government needs to make home ownership more affordable and create more social housing, along with providing services to those homeless at-risk people
AA11985004	The rise of female professional sports is not a new phenomenon. Women once competed in the gladiatorial arena though not without controversy. It is known that the Roman emperor Septimius Severus, who ruled from 193 to 211 AD, allowed women to fight as gladiators but banned the tradition in 200 AD. Recently, the remains of a young woman, approximately 20 years old, were found in Britain. Discovered in a Roman cemetery in the area of London known as Southwark and excavated in 1996, archaeologists uncovered the remains of the young woman buried with several items that may identify her as a female gladiator.    According to the curator of early London history at the London Museum, the items buried with the woman were a dish decorated with a fallen gladiator and other ceramic pieces decorated with similar scenes and gladiatorial symbols. Notably three of the eight lamps found in the grave are decorated with the Egyptian god Anubis, who was associated with the Roman messenger god Mercury. This association is important because in Roman times slaves dressed as Mercury removed the dead bodies from the arena. Mercury, and his Greek counterpart Hermes, traditionally led human souls to the underworld.    If the young woman found in the Roman cemetery was a gladiator, the wealth of materials found with her indicate that she was popular. The young woman's remains, the items buried with her, and a relief of two women with short swords and shields fighting are on display at the London Museum. The relief's inscription reads, "an honorable release from the arena." The women in the relief are identified as Amazonia and Achillea.    Despite the existence of archaeological evidence that supports the existence of female gladiators, no one is sure that the remains uncovered in London are actually those of a female gladiator.

bdU6XiGbaa	Australia and New Zealand are two very separate nations, with entirely different agendas on many issues.    Australia, has the official name 'Commonwealth of Australia', and was formed on 1 January 1901 when six states joined into a federation.     The Australian land mass was first charted (by Europeans) in 1606 by the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon. It was later settled by England as a prison colony for convicts.    This is a very different history to that of New Zealand. New Zealand, or Aotearoa, has the official name 'Realm of New Zealand', which also includes the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing but in free association); Tokelau; and the Ross Dependency (New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica). In addition to those areas New Zealand also includes the North Island, the South Island or Mainland, Stewart Island and the Chatham Islands, as well as several other small islands.     The first settlement of New Zealand was by Polynesians (Maoris) around 700 years ago. The land mass was first charted by a European in 1642 by Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman. After that trip no Europeans returned to New Zealand until James Cook's trip in 1768  1771.     After this New Zealand was visited often for trade and whaling, and eventually the British government sent William Hobson to New Zealand to claim sovereignty and negotiate a treaty with Maori. That treaty was the Treaty of Waitangi - which forms the core of New Zealand's birth as a modern nation. The Treaty was signed 6 February 1840.|`|Df68IhOCaa	Politically YES.

New Zealand is as much a part of Australia as Canada is a part of the USA.  The main difference is that Canada and the USA are separated by a line on the map.

zji1Dkruaa	I would Say Tehran Definitely !   Iran is a Great Country and a Great place to visit plus Iranians are known for their Hospitality!   Armenia is kinda ... Depressing cause still has the scars of communist on itself but the people are quite nice . ( My dad been there and whats he thinks so , He might be Wrong )    I Found this Site for you which shows some parts of Iran including Tehran which might be a bit Different from what u saw in ur Biased Media :) , check it if you like :    http://www.gooya.us/photos/2007/10/the-t...    btw Armenia was a part of Iran in around less than a Century ago , so if you are looking for a rich country in history and Culture , u wouldn't want to miss Iran !     The Final Decision is up to you but Wherever u  go hope u would Enjoy it .    Edit : The Person Below me is Right , Armenia is not a Part of Middle east !|`|tDvyf3Q5aa	Going to Iran would give you more choices as well as Tehran since Iran has other historical cities if you interested in, like Isfahan, Shiraz, Kashan, Hamedan etc.|`|wbJXqkVGaa	Go to Iran..it has immense history and culture.

So if your into history, head to Tehran. Don't forget its bustling city life too! Its like London, but Iranian style.

New York State Sales Tax,     2. New York City Sales Tax, and     3. New York City Hotel Room Occupancy Tax (usually called the "Hotel Tax").  Hotel Room Occupancy Tax (HROT) applies to the occupancy of any room in a hotel in the City. However, Finance adopted amendments to the HROT rules, which establish new guidelines for when a person will be considered subject to the hotel tax and an annual (instead of quarterly) filing requirement for small facility operators.    Note: Beginning March 1, 2009 the Hotel Room Occupancy Tax will increase from 5% of the room rate to 5.85% of the room rate for all room types.|`|1FPpglMpaa	NYC has the most expensive Hotel tax in the US.

I often book VERY safe 4 star hotels in Midtown Manhattan, right in the center of the city, for $80 per night. They give you a map on which you can select the area where in the city where you want to stay.    The price will include all taxes and fees.    There is a website which explains all about how to book through Priceline's "Name your own price" program. You may want to check it out and follow the instructions to get the very best deal. If you want a cheap, safe hotel the best way to go is with Priceline's name your own price program.    The site with the instructions is: http://www.CheapInTheCity.com    Looks under the "Save BIG on Hotels" section.    Good luck!
vWsElUtGaa	It is the best beach on Oahu. If you decided to go to the smaller islands check to make sure they are no wild life reserves first, you could get a big fine. If you really want to find the best beaches go to Maui for a day or two. You can get a ticket for around 70 to 100 bucks. They also have camp sites right on the beach at bellows air force base. I would defiantly check out the Ioani Palace, Hanauma Bay, USS Arizona(Pearl Harbor),National Cemetery of the Pacific and the Glider Rides/sky diving in north shore.|`|vaM9JtcTaa	powder beaches,,,,nice  bird island there too,,,,no valuables in the car,,,,they break in.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	It's very nice.

NXyeYpUAaa	Yes, I would say Hawaii is one of the safest states in the United States. Course thats not to say its 100% safe and you should still be cautious if you're going to shady parts of the island (but then again why would you go there when you're on vacation?) but most of the time, busy tourist attractions like Waikiki, Alamoana, are pretty much safe even at night time. Actually in Waikiki, most of the fun goes on at night.     Waikiki might get a bit rowdy at night time though because theres alot of weird guys who like to hit on you, but thats pretty much it. Its alot of fun because there are lots of people around and sidewalk shows and stuff. Well at least thats what it used to be like, I havent been there in a few months but I expect it to be a little less crowded with the economy going down the drain and tourism dropping here in Hawaii.     Fun things to do: lots of water activities.  You can go to the Hawaiian water parks  You could go snorkeling at Hanauma Bay   You can go shopping at the malls: Alamoana/ Waikiki (waikiki is more like a long street with lots of stores, restaurants, and hotels than an actual mall though)   Beaches:  Alamoana Beach   Waikiki Beach (usually super crowded though because its right by the hotels)  North Shore (Great for surfing, huge waves but a pretty long drive if you're staying near Waikiki)     Im not sure if there are many cheap hotels, since most of the hotels are in Waikiki and they are pretty pricy but I do know one cheap hotel which is Pagoda Hotel, its pretty close to Alamoana Boulevard.      www.pagodahotel.com    Even teenage kids go out by themselves at night all the time, and its pretty safe.|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	Aston Coral Reef Hotel in downtown   cheaper than most    1-800-950-1363

For instance, if you are in Flagstaff, which is in Northern Arizona it could be in the high 50's. Travel South to Phoenix and the average temperature may be 84. Tucson is cooler than Phoenix by a few degrees. Sedona, South of Flagstaff is a pleasant 72, on average in April.    Most people think of Phoenix weather when they think of Arizona. Phoenix can get up to the 100's or above during the day. It can also very cool at night. It is desert weather. What a great place to be in April!
o9wc604Gaa	Well in past years, Detroit had always been a boomtown because it used to the the heart of the auto industry.  However in recent years there has been a drop off in production and purchase of American automobiles and therefore the business in Detroit dwindled.    All of the infrastructure that had been built for this large bustling city became useless as people began to move out of the city to find lives elsewhere and from here you can kind of figure out the rest.    I hope that answered your question!|`|BWY5MPpLaa	Because it is freezing cold, dangerous, extremely overpriced, and jobless, crack central, anything else you need to know.|`|fIK9LBEuaa	Well, I don't think it is one of the worst places to live.     But it definitely has it's negatives.     For one, the crime. Although it isn't the "most dangerous city", it does have a high crime rate, and I wouldn't recommend walking by yourself at night.     The is the economy. These past couple of years have not been good for Detroit. With a lot of companies outsourcing to other countries, it makes it hard to find a job. Even part time jobs like low-paying office jobs are extremely hard to come by, and that doesn't even support a family. More and more businesses are closing everyday; which makes finding a job near impossible. Everyone is losing their houses, and since no one can find jobs, my prediction is that crime is only going to go up.    Once the economy gets better; and once the new Mayor gets things settled with the city; things will get better.|`|dv8267AAaa	High crime, schools have been said to have a high amount of students who don't graduate, increase in poverty etc....

i7oHTo9haa	Jordan was part of the Palestine region.  The Jordanian gov't are a peacable people so we don't push the fact so much.  The majority of the people you see calling themselves Palestinians are actually Syrian.  Syria was behind the push to make the PLO (who attacked Jordan King Hussein and used Jordanian soldier's head as soccer practice.) Syria is still behind the conflict to this day.  Syria developed the PLO to overthrow both Jordan AND Israel.    Syria just had hegemonistic intentions similar to Saddam had with Kuwait trying to re-establish Mesopotamia.  Syria wants Jordan, Israel, Lebanon so they can re-establish their ancient Greater Syrian Empire. The Palestine region was way back in Roman times, part of this Syrian Empire but their capital was always in Damascus.    Syria got their modern nation just like everyone else.

Before that it was part of the Ottoman Empire. It was never called Palestine after the Ottoman Empire took it over in the 1500s, until the British used it.  It was intended as a provisional name, to be used until the British could get it ready to split into two self-governing nations, one for the Arabs and one for the Jews.    They gave about 70% to the Arabs, as Trans-Jordan.  They gave the Gaza Strip to Egypt and the rest to Israel.

R2iCzRjsaa	Take the ferry to Koh Lan, for 20 baht and spend the day at Samae beach, which I think is every bit as nice as the beaches in Phuket.    Go to Nong Nooch Tropical Garden, it is beautiful, get your picture taken with a real 500 lb tiger, and a nice lunch.    See the Big Buddha on the side of the mountain with was done with Laser and brass, and across the street from that, take your elephant ride down the side of the hill through a plantation (much nicer experience than the touristy parks for an elephant ride).  Next door to the elephant ride, are MANY stalls, and tables for eating some pretty good BBQ type Thai food.  I like it, and it's ok to share with the resident dogs, and have fun.    Sriracchra has a good Tiger Zoo, with some very good shows included in the ticket.  To see that takes about one morning.    Tiffany is a female impersonator show.  I don't like them, but this one, I admit is GREAT, and worth seeing.    Pattaya has over 100 restaurants.  You can have a meal from between 35 baht up to thousands of baht.  Transportation is easy is Pattaya unlike BKK, you can get around town in less in few minutes, most of the time.   We have some good malls, good bargains on clothing and shoes.  Plenty of places to buy junky or nice souvenir things as well.    I like Pattaya, lived here for 5 years, don't go in for the sex for money scene, don't drink, have a fabulous social life and love it here.|`|qUiQF8x3aa	There are many great activities available in Pattaya that does not involve sex and drink.

Most people just never get to know Pattaya because they never get out of the bars and sleep until afternoon and that's alright. For others who like to do and see things Pattaya has a tremendous amount of things to do and see.    Pattaya is the oldest tourist destination in Thailand and offers just about everything. Touristy stuff, cultural stuff, and fun things.    All and any kind of water sports including scuba diving.  From Buddha mountain ( the largest Buddha image in the world) to the sanctuary of truth.    Parks, zoos, temples, elephant riding, the tiger zoo in Sriracha, and much much more.    For the shopping mall heads the largest shopping center in Asia opened on January 23rd right between beach road and 2nd road.

CZp3UdQdaa	I guess the term Latin-Europe (which I think it could actually exist...it depends what you mean by it, and I would understand it includes all the countries that speak languages that derive from latin) is not really used, or at least not as much as Latin America, so when you say latins...one can automatically assume you are talking about latin americans.|`|i1JVe24Oaa	There is no such thing as latin-europe.

One lives in england and the other lives in wales.    No, they do not have the same accent, welsh people have a welsh accent and english people have an english accent. Some welsh also speak the welsh language.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	We don't sound the same, we both have different regional dialects.  For example, I am british and a Sanddancer (coming from South Shields in between Sunderland and Newcastle) despite proximity, most Sanddancers would rather be thought of as Geordies (Newcastle) but there are London accents, not to be confused with Cockney, with is very broad.  Liverpool, Yorkshire, Manchester, the list is endless.    Wales is no different, around it's capital, Wales has a softer accent than many of the far reaches.  I would say there's not much difference in looks, as both countries have been diluted over the years by invaders and those moving in, so that our countries are diverse.    As to the guy who hates the British "because he is Scottish" being from the North East, I have never had any problems in Scotland, and have lived and worked there for years in my youth - it was great.  They seem to like Geordies, but have a real problem with those further down South - they do, as he says, appreciate the Welsh more.    Not sure about banks in Wales to be truthful, have not been to Wales for a long time - from an English person's point of view, it is better to visit larger towns, smaller villages are quite racist to English people - even when I was a child - I was met with prejudice and rudeness in almost every little place I have been.|`|UBNEzh0Saa	The Welsh are the true Britons.  The English are a mixture of invaders.  As for the accent, the Welsh have different accents as do the English.  Someone from London sounds different to someone from Liverpool and someone from Cardiff sounds different to someone from Anglesey and so forth.|`|8hjQRB7Aaa	Welsh people are very friendly and have SEXY accents!  English are arrogant and have Horrible accents!|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	The accent is the only difference. Welsh people are just the same as English people, they just have a nice accent, they sort of lengthen their words. Some Welsh people also speak Welsh which is a very strange language to those who don't understand it.|`|lg2RfcrQaa	Welsh people live in the hills with the sheep. They have no electricity or telephone line.  English people live in the lap of luxury and wear bowler hats and tweed suits.|`|m97HP71Oaa	there do not speak the same as us|`|2AXTmluFaa	the accent.|`|AA11324576	count the number of fingers on each hand. there lies the difference|`|1cfa3610b6d1b6140a73170b42273c55aa	Both Historically and Genetically the differences are HUGE. As modern people the differences are slight although the rural Welsh folk are well renowned for their friendly nature, people are people and one can't generalise too much. English is spoken over all of the U.K. but the welsh have their own language which is one of the most ancient of the Celtic/Gaelic languages in the world.

XrhaufzHaa	Hello!  There are a ton of great sites you can visit! I myself love Disney, and find myself visiting these sites everyday! Here are descriptions of each with links:    www.netcot.com    (my favorite Disney website!)  This is more of a forum website, but there is a podcast that goes along with it, and if you like all things Disney (especially Disney World) I suggest you subscribe to it!! You can listen to the podcast for free! If you don't already have iTunes, download it (it's free) and under podcasts, just search 'Netcot'. The podcast is made by a guy named Van, who is awesome! There is usually a new show each week (unless Van is away or something). Each show includes news, a featured attraction, a top 7 list (for example, Top 7 Walt Disney World Resorts), and at the end, there is audio from the parks! You can listen to Disney background music, ride audio, pre-shows for the attractions, and more! He also does special video podcasts among other things. The website is a great place to talk about it! Every person on the forum is extremely nice! We have a lot of fun sharing our Disney obsession here!  Here is a link to the podcast section of the site:  http://www.netcot.com/thesite/podcast/    www.ourlaughingplace.com  This website is great to find reviews of dining experiences, attractions, hotels, Adventures By Disney, and more! I especially like this site because of the pictures of restaurants, food, and attractions. They also have a resort price calculator, and a countdown to your next trip timer!    www.wdwinfo.com  This is another great website that has reviews, photos, and descriptions of attractions, dining experiences, etc!!     I hope that these websites are as much fun for you as they are for me! Have a magical day!|`|tV7ZYIeEaa	http://www.wdwinfo.com/|`|rSq790ksaa	The best website to get information and ask questions from Disney Cast Members or just Disney experts go to intercot.com    Everyone is so friendly there and you'll get lot's of great answers.

Be careful when you do this. Do not stop until the full fart has been expelled. Walk an extra 30 feet to make sure the smell has left your pants.    FLY BY    The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping.  Walk in and check for other poopers. If there are others in the bathroom, leave and come  back again. Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.  People may become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the bathroom.    ESCAPEE    A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or forcing a poop  in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave of embarrassment.  If you release an escapee, do not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen.  If you are standing next to the farter in the urinal, pretend you did not hear it.  No one likes an escapee. It is uncomfortable for all involved. Making a joke or  laughing makes both parties feel uneasy.    JAILBREAK    When forcing a poop, several farts slip out at a machine gun pace.  This is usually a side effect of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should  happen, do not panic. Remain in the stall until everyone has left the bathroom to  spare everyone the awkwardness of what just occurred.    COURTESY FLUSH    The act of flushing the toilet the instant the poop hits the water.  This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink up the bathroom.  This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF SHAME.    WALK OF SHAME    Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you have just  stunk up the bathroom. This can be a very uncomfortable moment if someone  walks in and busts you. As with farts, it is best to pretend that the smell  does not exist. Can be avoided with the use of the COURTESY FLUSH.    THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (P.F.N)    A group of co-workers who band together to ensure emergency pooping  goes off without incident. This group can help you to monitor the where  abouts of Out Of The Closet Poopers, and identify SAFE HAVENS.    SAFE HAVENS    A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where you can least  expect visitors. Try floors that are predominantly of the opposite sex.  This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the bathroom.    TURD BURGLAR    Someone who does not realize that you are in the stall and tries to  force the door open. This is one of the most shocking and vulnerable moments  that can occur when taking a poop at work. If this occurs, remain in the stall  until the Turd Burglar leaves. This way you will avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.    CAMO-COUGH    A phony cough that alerts all new entrants into the bathroom that you  are in a stall. This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON, or to alert  potential Turd Burglars. Very effective when used in conjunction with an  ASTAIRE.    ASTAIRE    A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential Turd Burglars that  you are occupying a stall. This will remove all doubt that the stall is  occupied. If you hear an Astaire, leave the bathroom immediately so the pooper can poop in peace.    WATERMELON    A poop that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet water. This is also an embarrassing incident. If you feel a Watermelon coming on, create a diversion. See CAMO-COUGH.    HAVANA OMELET    A case of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes in the toilet water. Often accompanied by an Escapee. Try using a Camo-Cough with an ASTAIRE.    UNCLE TED    A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever. Could spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on the pot. An Uncle Ted makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you should always wait to poop when the bathroom is empty. This benefits you as well as the other bathroom attendees.|`|T2rROc5Qaa	I haven't a clue!
NZPgCcHWaa	From terminals 4(Iberia and One World group)  and Terminal 2 (all other airlines) take the Metro to Nuevos Ministerios (ed of the line). At the entrance  to the metro in both terminals is an information of Metro Madrid, which will help you with a map of the system, also in www.metromadrid.es. At Nuevos Ministerios you have to change the metro line (dont remember the number of the line) to Chamartin, 4 stops only. In Chamartin go up to the rail station. For the line to El Escorial look up www.renfe.es. Go there to the page of Cercanias of Madrid. It is a red C. there you can look up the time table and print it out. That is the best I can hel you.  The Meto from the terminals runs about every 5 minutes, travelling time to Nuevos Ministerios about 20 minutes, from there to Chamartin about 10 minutes.  Have a good trip!|`|tQsxsuNPaa	OH!  The public trasport is primo!  Metro is very clean and quick.

But to get from Madrid to El Escorial you will need to catch a train from Madrid Chamartin station.  There are about 8 trains per day, and the trip takes around 1 hour.  Timetable details are available at http://www.renfe.es

I know plenty of Cretans here in Turkey, you'd actually be surprised! <br>  <br>  Honestly I don't want to generalize since I'm not an expert but I think Cretans are the best kind of Greek there is (like Artvin Turks are the best kind of Turks there is), keep in mind though that I just know mainland Greeks (Athenians mostly), Cretans and Thracians but all in all Cretans are the most fun, lively and warm hearted, I also found them the most laid back and tolerating (Imagine this, I could get into a heated political topic and actually see eye to eye most time). I want to repeat though, I'm generalizing, I only know a handful of Greeks personally (Not Turkish Greeks, I mean Greek Greeks) and two or three of them are Cretans. I found them to be very Turk-like in their attitudes, I'm talking about the coastal Turks (Black sea included) Mediterranean would be better suited I guess, stubborn, proud but curious and eager to learn at the same time. <br>  <br>  Oh and THE FOOD IS OH MY GOD AMAZING, there are a few Cretan restaurants here and I swear even if the food is super healthy and super light I still end up gaining a few pounds at the end of the night despite all the dancing. They had these honey dipped doughs that were magical, I kinda forgot the name, it'd be awesome if you knew it though :)|`|yEe3WkFCaa	Ela, Sophia...<br>  I know like a million Cretans, you being one, and my aunt is Cretan.  They are very friendly, fun to talk to, open-minded, and yes, a bit stubborn, but they are very fun to hang with and laugh with!  Cough Cough** you!<br>  <br>  We Roumeliotises love our Cretan friends!|`|2dWlUEimaa	Very friendly and patriotic, yet extremely hot-blooded and a bit stubborn. Hmm...sounds a bit like somebody who uses this forum and is Cretan ;-)|`|gcRgEFrmaa	Cretans are awesome!|`|obo57lVpaa	I only met Cretans in a fantastic Cretan restaurant in Athens  afew years ago. It was called Pasifai and we had the most fantastic food ever: meraklis salads, filo pastry and my favorite yogurt, honey and walnuts.<br>  It was so good I made my parents take me there every time we went to Athens. I don't know if it's still there, I was in it last for the Olympics.<br>  I know Cretans should be nice people judging from this food but unfortunately judging by you, I don't think so.|`|SOawUqxqaa	Cretans are white people.

AA11310208	You can do it if you don't want too much luxury.  Most backpackers head to Khaosan Road for a cheap room: 200 -600 baht.  Travel :around by local buses or Chao Phraya river taxis 10-20 baht p or 50-80 baht within Bangkok for an average meter taxi trip  Food , cheap : 25-50 baht per meal per person. (Street stalls or small restaurants)  Drinks: Tourist bars would charge around 60-80 baht for a small beer I guess. 7-Eleven charges 30 baht or so if you just have some drinks with other travellers around your guesthouse. Some shops offer 3 big bottles of beer for around 100 baht. Thai rum is 230 baht for a bottle. A big bottle of Coke is 23 baht. Ice in a bag is 5-6 baht.   Admission fees.. That ranges from nothing (most things don't really cost anything) to 20 baht.  However if you meet a girl then that could be the end of your budget.|`|Mstjct2Jaa	Depends if you're going short time or long time.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Barely!  If this is your first trip, and you are having to pay for hotel alone, you'll have to be quite careful.  You can do it, but decide if you want to be that careful with money in a big city.  There's no beach there, you know?  If you want R&R, you might consider some time in Pattaya on the beach which is close and easy to get to by bus (128 baht).  Watana Mansions is one of the cheapest hotels I know, which is very decent, for 550 baht, but there are hostels also for 300, approx.  There are ATM machines everywhere, so have some back-up in the bank that you can draw from if you get carried away.|`|jtoxFsdYaa	While 13,000 baht may be more than a month's salary for many Thais,it won't get you that far. The last time I was there, about two years ago I went through around 80,000 baht over the two weeks that I was there, and I was living a life of luxury and debauchery.    I really comes down to what you want to while you are there and what level of accomodation that you want.    If you are looking for the cheaper backpacker type of accomodation you should head for the Khao San Road area. There are plenty of budget Guest Houses there that provide B&B or even bed only.    Although you can find many places on the internet, I would suggest that you just head for the area and book into whichever place takes your fancy.    Finally, if you take a taxi from the airport, get one from the official taxi rank and make sure that the meter is running when the journey begins. You will pay a small charge for the service at the taxi rank but it will save you getting ripped off for much more by an unscrupulous cab driver.|`|Vlp50eEGaa	Yes it can.  Just depends on what your planning to do.  If you plan to party and pick up a girl at a bar then you have to increase this amount.
kNI690xuaa	You should def go see Ann Frank's house but word of warning: go early cos the q's can b massive and right around the street.

DLxh9CANaa	Indianapolis does NOT get 25 million tourists a year, pal- I was raised in Indiana, and I know this for a fact because of personal experience. There have been a few movies filmed in the city, yes, but the skyline there is ANYTHING BUT Manhattan like in appearance. Indianapolis sprawls out all over the place, and unlike Manhattan, there are no clear dividing lines between different areas. Also, Indianapolis is growing, but at NOWHERE NEAR the same level NYC is.  I'd have to say no, it isn't.|`|SYPeab1Raa	Um....Maybe in 200 years.        Btw, Indianapolis's skyline is no-where near Manhattens skyline. Indianapolis is very sprawled out.     (Also Indianapolis doesnt recieve 25 million INTERNATIONAL visitors a year.  There lucky if they recieve 25)|`|gJjC8Dl2aa	well i would say that the way it is becoming NYC is that indy has a mexico section so next we need chinese and all the other ethnic areas ny has and then maybe we will be close in that sense.  nothing fancy here just the new dome they built for the colts!
JEMtVVkBaa	well I know that for Australian Air Force, as long as you meet all of the academic, physical and psycological requirements (which is very hard to achieve), then they accept pilots who may not have had experiance in aircraft before.    A definient passion is needed, but because not everyone can afford flying lessons, you dont need much experiance.    It may be different for the Air Force over there in the USA, but it may be very similar at the same time. The requirements should be on the Air Force website.|`|3a26676eec934629fc30cb8017c1d782aa	I am pretty sure they train you their own way, it may be helpful to you to know the basics but the Air Force would train anyone their way as I suspect they have a specific way of doing things, procedures and all that|`|xEyByCxwaa	yo so wait you have to hold the B button not Z

Y5qIP5kPaa	In general Egypt is really a heaven compared to lots of countries,, I think the major problems in Egypt are due to the lack of education, and mainly that we give authority to uneducated /idiots to run our life,, I am not talking now about big posts, as an example: Older police men are wiser and better that stupid (mokhber/solider) simply because the last one is not educated,, The problem that  who runs really our lives are these small persons... if you give authority to such people over normal people they will misuse their powers not because they want so only  but because as I said they are idiots and are suffering lots of inferiority complexes...<br>  As life is a chain action, that leads that people lose the faith on the authority , and hence , they lose also the discipline<br>  <br>  anyway Nothing can be corrected if we do not admit clearly our mistakes, admitting the mistakes is different than propagate it in order to lose the self confidence,, I see lots of programs , and lots of talks with one only aim that people lose their self confidence and that is the first step in (a cultural) occupation which leads to destroy the ID , and a social and an economic occupation ,which are more effective than a physical occupation..|`|5YPh5RXPaa	That's a real pity and the real reason behind it is that we have low self-esteem and don't see what's positive in ourselves. <br>  Also, because of the amount of negative things around us, we've become sarcastic as far as anything positive is concerned and we feel that it is beyond our reach. It can't be ours.<br>  Another reason is that self-criticism is the best policy for mending one's problems, but when it is exaggerated, it becomes ridiculous.|`|rVD7CTfVaa	first your question is not balanced but i will try to answer as i understood ..... its not wrong from t.v programs to show the bad facts of our life and our country unless they didn't show it to give a bad image for tourists.....and why government always show great facts of the country ? you can ask them :D :D|`|AA10956234	lol, I will not answer, but i will just add something, <br>  <br>  Did you ever watch any program on DW or TV5 or BBC showing dirty streets in Germany, France , ...etc , or showing stupid people ???<br>  <br>  I went to France many times, and i saw streets more dirty than here, and strange people, also not friendly at all, I mean that's not what they show, they always show the good side they have, not the best, but the good one, <br>  <br>  I will not be a brave man or people will clap to me if i show how my house is dirty from inside just to show to them that my family are not caring people!!!<br>  <br>  Anyway, that's something i wanted to add, thanks|`|FNCohXNiaa	"yeb2a enta akeed fe masr" i love that program,because it doesnt get the worst of egypt, it gets you the things u already know!it just shows them to u and says it in a funny way.we law la7ezt, at the end of the shows he says " we7na 3shan ben7eb masr, we want it to become better and better" if he didnt say that i would hate him and the show, but because he regularly says it, then i dont mind.i wouldnt want him to lie and say egypt is so perfect its unbelieveble, because no country is perfect to be honest<br>  <br>  also, if you go to facebook, you will see like 1000 groups about funny and stupid stuff in egypt, and the mistakes that we make.they arent there to show people how bad egypt is, its there just to make you laugh for fun, <br>  <br>  these people that show egypt in a bad way just like that, are pessimistic, i am not.and i think egypt has got the good and the bad, but the good is much more than the bad, thats why i think we are very lucky in egypt to be able to live better than a lot of other countries around the world.|`|9R8uYHcPaa	because normal is boring .. <br>  <br>  who would want to watch a TV program about something you see everyday in your household ?<br>  <br>  it's for the ratings .. and money .. <br>  <br>  and i disagree .. foreign TV channels always show programs like this .. for example the shows CHEATERS and COPS .. have you watched the British Cops ?? following drunken criminals etc ? ..|`|hhhk499qaa	Well I should always show my bad sides because every body has bad sides and good sides.

I personally feel you get that a lot here in YA. I mean A lot of people post negative questions, many on purpose to insult or say negative things, and egyptians go along with it agree with and add fuel to the fire. They just strengthen the opinions. its sad. However, none of its lies which is wat makes it sader. i am by nature quite over protective when it comes to Egypt, like i would be of a family member if someone insulted them as I have a lot of love for the country. This doesnt take away the fact that these shows and images are true :( <br>  <br>  There are many videos , songs and programs (generally for tourism purposes) that do show the beauty of egypt too. <br>   <br>  I know that cop program angelo mentioned well lol. Most programs show teenagers girls and guys acting terribly when they are drunk. But its true it happens almost every friday and saturday night!!!! Its fact and a reality. The funniest tho is when i saw my drunk work colleague on there once. I never let them live it down they got a ￡60 fine for weeing against a doorway when they were drunk ;o)
lcj1AKt1aa	You can try Barbados and stay at Almond beach club and Spa which is adults-only. http://www.almondresorts.com/Resorts/Alm...  This is something that I have put together for you. Please read it.    A Barbados Briefing  Barbados is a coral island, pushed out of sea by volcanic activity in a far away time. On the West Coast of Barbados, coral shore beaches of fine white sand stretch along a blue-green sea. Coral reefs fringe the Barbados shoreline to provide excellent snorkeling and Scuba Diving. Along the East Coast a lively surf is blown briskly by the strong and constant trade winds and the waves pound against a rocky shore. The constant breeze of the trade winds gives Barbados a mild and pleasant tropical climate.    When you visit Barbados, you will see it is mostly a flat coral island with excellent beaches, but there are rolling hills and many deep ridges and gullies, with an interesting distribution of flora and fauna. Within the Barbados coral core there is a vast array of caves and underground lakes which provide an excellent supply of drinking water that is amongst the purest in the world. Geologically Barbados is unique, being actually two land masses that merged together over the years. This and other anomalies make this Caribbean Island quite phenomenal, and there are geological structures that you will find only in Barbados.  Barbados Expectation  Barbados is a very beautiful island, with lots of art, activities, night life, music, history and some of the best restaurants to be found anywhere. But what makes Barbados even more special, and the reason why so many visitors keep returning to the island year after year, is the people. Barbadians, called Bajans, are warm and friendly souls, always ready to greet you with a sincere smile. Barbadians make you feel welcome and special, in this lovely Caribbean Island. You will feel its your home and will want to come back again and again to Barbados: A unique Caribbean paradise, surprisingly sophisticated, friendly, fun and always Naturally Charming!    http://barbados.org/  Some all-inclusive resorts here including Almond Casuarina which is very near to the night life (St. Lawrence Gap).

QdYiF0f6aa	i had to pay $110 for a box at forex.    i believe that if you sent the box directly at the forex office, then you would have only paid $70. but then you would also have to shoulder the additional expense of sending the box to their office.     since you went through a middle person, their rate is different  since they will charge you extra for transporting the box to the forex office as well as additional profit for their business.    btw, in our area, forex does not pick up individual boxes.  we had to drop ours off at a filipino store, and  forex only came by when there were enough boxes for them to pick up.  we could have dropped the box of ourselves at jacksonville for only $65/ box but a one-way 5-hour drive is just too much especially when we were pressed for time.    also, you should have a pink slip with the tracking number on it. tracking number has a 3-letter prefix before the number.|`|ETmfe6kDaa	I think you got swindled.  best clarify it with the person you dealt with before reporting her swindling *** to the authorities.  if not the authorities, the Forex website should have a contact number for its main office here in the US.  you can call them and report that swindler.|`|07799fFNaa	If they didn't give you the waybill with the tracking number. You might have been swindled. Call Forex asap and give them the info the receipt. or they could have been an agent of forex but had to add some sort of commission.|`|TKHHRUB4aa	Call the Forex office located near you. Forex normally place a sticker with a tracking number that corresponds to your receipt to each box you send.    Next time when you send, just call the Forex office and ask them to pick it up from your house and they will do that for you.    I never had any problem concerning my packages sent to Philippines and am happy with the Forex service.

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	OK, so I do not know the specifics in Philly, but a number of years ago, big, colored arrows exactly like you describe appeared in the streets of Seattle in the Pioneer Square area of the city stretching north all the way to the Pike Place Market, a distance of almost 2 miles. It turned out these were tour routes for walking art tours to various places and galleries within the local Pioneer Square and downtown metro area. It was easier to paint big arrows in the street than to paint many little ones on the sidewalks. Handouts for each tour were available at all kinds of places around the city where public transit information was available.|`|fFnsJ7maaa	If they look like this, they are fake speedbumps. I believe Philadelphia drivers are too smart to fall for that more than once.     http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,3731...|`|AA10940629	They were painted to look like speed bumps.  It's supposed to be an optical illusion.  I guess it's a cheaper alternative to actually installing speed bumps.
dpKntiZoaa	Yes it is a very kid and also family orientated country - in fact the country which in a recent survey was found to be the most family oriented country in Europe (e.g. due to laws on part-time working, parental leave, and communication between parents and children)    As a mum of two (oldest being 2.5, then I can give you help by Email if you want to contact me - my Email is on my profile).    Anyway, there are loads of pre-schools and also international schools in Rotterdam, Den Haag & Amsterdam - and the international schools have community networks built around them as well - e.g. yahoo groups for buying/selling, for advice, advertising etc.      You don't mention where you/your spouse/partner are working in NL. To be honest, probably the biggest headache in NL is traffic jams in the rush hour.  Therefore unless you can/want to use the public transport network (very good btw) then it is best to live close to where you will work, and then of course the schooling depends on that    International schools are indeed very good, but if you are planning a long-term stay, then also consider sending your children to mainstream schooling.  Your daughter is young enough to learn Dutch without a problem.  It would be a big bonus for her to have this (local friends, a second language etc).  Also of course a lot cheaper for you, and education in NL is very good.  You do not gain much/anything from International schooling, unless of course it is a temporary contract and you plan to return to the US in the short-term    You will need medical insurance (mandatory in the Netherlands) and also costly it provides good coverage.  The medical facilities from local doctors to university hospitals are also first rate - the only complaint I have is the waiting list though for medical procedures.  My husband works for an International organisation in Den Haag, so we have medical cover though an 'International' policy, and so I could choose to go to Belgium to reduce the wait.  So ask your company/organisation as if they may have a standing arrangement with an insurance company.      There are Indian restaurants most certainly.  There are also small deli's with some Indian based products.  We have two friends (colleagues of my husband) who often cook Indian food for us, and they use staple products (rice, basic spices etc) from the supermarket, but do have some special spices from home.  If you are here and struggling to find something then I can ask them (they are based in Den Haag)    If you can update where your employment is, then it would make it a lot easier for people to help you. Indeed there are several regular answerers based (or formally based) in Den Haag, Amsterdam, Groningen etc, and so they can offer advice if you make this known.    P.S. - Sorry but I disagree with Tjhief, as someone who used to live on the border of Amsterdam/Amstelveen until last year, I can honestly say that it is not fair to say that A'dam is not conducive to family life.  As with everywhere, there are good and bad area's in Amsterdam.  Amstelveen is very family friendly, very green and a lot of young families do live there. I also have friends in Diemen with a young family that love the area.|`|zWy5zOhyaa	You do not mention where in the Netherlands you are moving to but there are many Indian restaurants around the  country. See the site below for details     http://www.indianfoodsguide.com/indian-f...    You will also find a few Indian Grocery stores as well. See below for details     http://www.indianfoodsguide.com/indian-f...      Good luck with your move.|`|rELPkc26aa	There's a lot of questions there, you seem very uncertain about moving here, let me try to help you out with some of this :)    First of all, the Netherlands is a nice country for kids, sure. There are some English schools in the big cities, I know for a fact that where I live (The Hague) there are several English schools.    The medical in the Netherlands is fairly well taken care of, it is mandatory to have health insurance and it is usually quick and easy.    There are many Indian restaurants and communities, but mostly in the big cities, again, in The Hague I'm sure, since I know that many Indian families live here and have stores and restaurants.    Amsterdam an Rotterdam proably have the same kinds of communities there, but then, if you want a real family neighbourhood I wouldn't go to Amsterdam.    I hope I gave you some help at least :)
61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	Hi,the people who make fun of you are idiots.When i was at school i had a lot of fun poked for being a red head.When i left school the tide turned.Stand up & be proud your a natural bet in Egypt no one laughs they will admire your hair & pale skin.Make sure you take plenty of skin protection.Have a lovely holiday|`|9R8uYHcPaa	r u going to Egypt for tourism or to find a boyfriend ?    u look fine don't worry .. and guys in Egypt want to get with anything that moves anyway ..|`|ie5AKYToaa	Many Arabs try to dye their hair red with henna, so I think you may find some who are jealous of your natural hair color.|`|2x41IPGcaa	bleach your skin and hair|`|AA10323130	You will look exotic in Egypt and that is something that Egyptians (and anybody really) likes. Most Egyptians are dark skinned and have dark hair.. so you will be different and attractive here. Plus I bet you're not ugly anyways.. I love your hair!    Dont feel bothered by the stares you will get.. ALOT of people will stare at you because they will enjoy looking at you since you look different from them.

Have a great time :]|`|ravzJTVOaa	Egyptians will fall in love with you bec of your red hair and freckled skin.  you will be different and attractive in our eyes .  dont dye your hair , keep it natural .  you will be loved by men as well as women.|`|ufdFei1jaa	I feel that your hair colour and complexion are not a problem at all.|`|HC0bamg9aa	Just don't take notice of anyone, I want my hair to be thinned out and permanently straightened and dyed a deep red but my school wont approve. :P|`|8HnLYjK4aa	you are unique, enjoy it. anybody that would laugh at you is an immature child and they do not deserve your consideration.|`|Uac9AXmDaa	i wish my hair was like yours|`|7PCssHMIaa	No don't worry you will be fine, here we don't know the hatred of ginger people that is quite popular and widespread in the UK.|`|baxhcxOeaa	Wow you are very lucky! Honestly I would love red hair. And as for freckles they are totally cool. I've got loads too. I really hated them when I was younger too but honestly I love them now! they are quirky and different and beautiful.    As for going to egypt, they will be in awe of you! Egyptians rarely see anyone with red hair and pale skin (apart from holiday makers). Believe me nobody will make fun of you. The opposite infact, when i was over there on holiday my sister has red hair and pale skin and the men wouldn't stop staring at her. One man asked my dad if he could 'buy' and offered a jewellery shop for her hand in marriage! So I'd say be warned, you will be in demand and it can be a bit over the top. make sure you are always with someone and be careful. That said, Egypt is a beautiful place and I'm sure you will really love it.     Hope you have a great holiday and honestly be proud of your looks, your different and that is awsome. xxx|`|uBDEKuKQaa	I am from Alexandria and i guarantee you nobody will laugh on you but they will just look at you because you will be unique and tourist that's all, not for your hair color or skin.

Vlp50eEGaa	Any time is a good time to visit Thailand.  June is doing the rainy season, but that's not going to cause any problems for you.  Short periods of heavy rain and it's over and it's hot and humid again.  It's also during the low season where hotel and resorts reduce their rates.   A good time to come and enjoy yourself.|`|jtoxFsdYaa	I will also be going in May/June to spend my birthday with my fiancee in Bangkok. I have been there many times and at various times of the year, including the rainy season, and always enjoyed the experience.    It would be difficult to give much advice not knowing what your interests are. The only general pieces of advice I would give you are always make sure that a taxi driver starts the meter before moving off, never display the soles of your feet, except on a beach, and remember that the Thais treat their royal family like gods and any disrespect can land you in prison.    Finally, try to learn at least a few basic phrases in Thai, the people really appreciate the effort.    Otherwise, have great time in The City of Angels in the Land Of Smiles.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Bangkok is hot, and rainy then.

I understand what you're feeling; here in the United States, gun violence is far more commonplace, symptomatic of our spoiled, impatient, violent culture in which many individuals feel "entitled" to something they aren't getting.    But violence and injustice are part of human history; there is no time and no place that has been free of it. In this age of World Wide Web, we are all able to hear of these terrible things with much more immediacy than in years past, so we find ourselves noticing a lot more of it than when it could simply be read once a day in the local newspaper.    Believe me...Ireland has been MUCH worse for violence than it is today. It's true that guns and drugs are more commonplace recently, especially in Dublin...but you don't have to go far back into Irish history to see how much worse it has been (and I don't just mean the Troubles).    I'm not trying to say that you should close your eyes to the news...in fact, it's good to pay attention to daily events, even the terrible ones. But try to keep a sense of perspective about it; much is beyond your control. You can only take care of you and yours, and do what you are able to do to change your part of the world for the better, if you choose.|`|afeoTehEaa	If people stopped using drugs then there wouldn't be a market for them in the first place.

It's a very chilled place to spend the evening.  My husband and I got engaged there.  Nearby Hisaronu is really busy - similar to Marmaris, but it makes a change when you fancy something a bit louder.    As someone else mentioned, Kas is also gorgeous.  Very quiet, beautiful, unspoilt.  It's small though, so there's not a lot going on in the town itself.  A good place for swimming in the sea, if you like that.  Plenty of excursions.    Side is very nice - the sunsets in the evening are stunning, and you get a lot of photographers taking photos of couples every evening.  Lovely for your photo album!  There are plenty of restaurants to choose from, but not too loud.  Popular with German / European tourists, not dominated by Brits.  Alanya and Antalya are not far, and make a nice excursion - for example to the nearby waterfalls.    Personally, I'd say avoid Altinkum.  That's where we went on our honeymoon, and it was not at all what we were hoping.  It was loud and busy, but lacked the charm of Icmeler / Side / Olu Deniz.    Hope you enjoy your honeymoon wherever you go, and have a lovely wedding.

yTkNT3OSaa	I believe Wikipedia has something along those lines, although what constitutes a city is up for debate.    For example, many people would say Manchester is larger than Bradford, but officially, Bradford is larger. It's down to way the council works; the City of Bradford council covers a much wider area than the City of Manchester council, because there are numerous separate councils within "Manchester" (for example, Salford is geographically a part of Manchester, but has its own council, and therefore is classed as a separate place in official figures).

Shootings are common. Rexdale used to be the home of large English and Scottish populations and wealthy corporations, but is now home of a large number of Blacks. And certain areas of it, such as Stovetop and Jamestown, are completely populated by Blacks. View http://www.stormfront.org/forum/showthre...    3. FYI, your English is curious. When you ask, "Need help with finding directions on Map Quest!? Ok so I need help finding directions to somewhere on Map Quest if you could help me? I'm starting off in Toronto Canada .. at Islington and Lakeshore...(thats the intersection) and I want to get to Stovetop Rexdale. help!", do you mean to ask, "Where is Stovetop, Rexdale, Ontario?"     4. FYI, before you use Mapquest, http://www.mapquest.com/ you should know where you're traveling to. Before you ask for directions, you should know your destination. "Stovetop" is not exactly a household name, so be as specific as possible. Use up to 100 words to describe your destination. What is this "Stovetop Rexdale"? Is it a street... a store... a service.... an apartment complex... the name of a business at some unknown address in Rexdale, Ontario?     5. FYI, your English is curious. When you say, "Need help with finding directions on Map Quest!?" this is not a question, but a statement followed by exclamation and question marks, neither of which makes your statement a question.    6. FYI, "Islington and Lakeshore" is not Toronto, but Etobicoke. And Rexdale is ambigious, too, because it's the name of the municipality called "Rexdale, Ontario", which is now "Etobicoke, Ontario". And "Rexdale" is also the name of a "Rexdale Boulevard" which is also in Rexdale, Ontario. And there are neither streets nor private businesses that bear the name, "Stovetop" in Rexdale, Ontario.    I hope this helps.
7Y2jmO7Taa	You've gotten a lot of mixed info on this question, some good and some bad.    Here's my take:    Women's clothes start going on sale here WAY too early! The coats are already on sale, and spring clothing is already in the stores!!! (It's crazy, I know, but I've just learned to expect it to be that way!)     By March, there will probably NOT be a lot of coats available, or possibly ANY, so you really should get something before you come.     As to the weather, March 1 is still Winter around here. It could be warm, but it's usually quite cold till at least the middle of March. We've had some brutal weather in March, actually. But we could have a warm snap. You just never know.    Both my kids have early March birthdays, so I really am aware of the weather. I wouldn't think of having an outdoor birthday for them, and one year we had an outdoor ice skating party! Yes, the rinks are all still open until mid-March. It's COLD in early March.    Buy a warm Winter jacket!|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	You can buy a light jacket in New York. You can get gloves or keep your hands in your pockets. March is usually windy and we have had some really heavy snow storms in March. Not every year, only some years.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, coats and jackets will still be on sale in March. However, they will be sold at a discount as store will be in the process of clearing their winter inventory.    Good luck|`|4yaBrTSxaa	the highest the temperature will be is 65 degrees Farenheit. The lowest will probabaly be 35 degrees Farenheithight. In New York City you can find anything. Yiu will not have a problem finding a coat. Have a great time.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Because you will be arriving to NYC around spring, it may be a difficult for you to purchase a coat while you're here. Most stores are already starting to get rid of their winter inventory and it's only the end of January. Early March can be very cool or unseasonable warm. Your best bet is to bring one with you. Bring clothing that you can layer (sweaters like cardigans, sweatshirts, hoodies, etc.) so that you can take them off or put them on when required.    Who gave me a thumbs down? ugh!|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	The beginning of March can be pretty cold.  One of the biggest blizzards we ever had in NYC was in March.    You should get really good end-of-season sales on things like jackets, hats and gloves.  It could be a good plan to buy something when you get here; you should be able to get some great bargains.  To be safe, you should probably pack at least a warm jacket.  You'll definitely need that, at the very least.  Almost forgot:  Have a great trip!!  You'll love it!|`|9561bfcf1a05d328055061d4b26e8f40aa	Since its around March , im sure you wont have a hard time to find a jacket because most stores have clearance , they want to get ride of coats and put new stocks in. dont worry in newyork city you can find anything and everything.. and for the gloves you can buy them almost anywhere.|`|MvDu7hZmaa	In Manhattan, go to 34th Street.  That's where you'll find one of the world's biggest department stores----MACY*s, and it is theee BEST for sales.  (Just last week, I bought an $80 blouse for $18!  Maybe you can purchase a coat online and pick it up when you arrive.  It's worth a try.      Across the street from Macy*s is a store called Conway's.  Super cheap, and they will definitely have coats warm enough for March.    The temperature range, in March, is 34-49o Fahrenheit.  Enjoy!|`|lPDRQH7aaa	There will be light jackets for sale at the stores. You will need gloves, hat, scarf etc. The weather really varies so you never know. Bring a lot of layers! Good Luck!

PdtpXFZ8aa	If the receiver is ready and capable of keeping a pet and have been wanting one, why not. But some people prefer to pick their own pets so you might want to take her to the pet shop and let her pick her pet.|`|r1IRcrMPaa	I remember one valentines day, I gave my mother a parrot that could speak 7 languages, as a gift.    After a month, I came to visit my Mom, and asked her "How's the parrot".. she replied "mmmm delicious"..    I was shocked and shouted at her "You ate the parrot, it could speak 7 languages, its one of a kind"     With a kind smile and in low tone of voice she replied "Why didn't he said so"...|`|50pKPrHxaa	Yes it is. i once received 2 pairs of love birds. i was really happy upon receiving them!yey!|`|5e7db1e7e3806c79f1295c82d64b7bb8aa	I agree with Flappy. The person receiving the pet must be someone responsible and desiring to take on the responsibilities of owning a pet. I once was given a kitten for my birthday. I did not like cats at the time. I lived in the rectory and was not allowed to have a pet. I thanked her for the cat and drove straight to the S.P.C.A. and paid the $40 fee and prayed it got a good home.  I was insulted that she would give me a gift without any consideration to my needs. I would prefer someone not give me a gift if they are not willing to give thought to what I want, need, or can accommodate. It is also cruel to place a pet in a home where it is not wanted.|`|AA11828341	As long as it comes from the heart. :)|`|UbqkxUomaa	if someone gives me puppy i promise to take care of it. i promise!|`|EjhJliKmaa	never give one.  it would hurt too much if your palalab starts giving the pet more attention than you.|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	yes, it would work... as long as you don't give her snakes...

Fz5TLaLDaa	It's not the size of the property it's how much you have to pay for it.    The best value properties for someone from the UK to stay in at the moment are villas rented directly from the owner.    You have 2 bargaining tools - "last minute" and the fact that you want to stay a month which saves the owner their weekly cleaning fees.    I think you should be able to get a place in the Davenport / highway 27 area for 1000 a month - and I don't think you will get any type of accomodation cheaper (not even a cheap motel room).    All you have to do is check out the websites that you can search by availability and price and then start ringing around or emailing to make an offer - there are hundreds of properties to choose from even though February is the high season for snowbirds. Someone will let you have their place for a grand. You just have to be cheeky and tell them to take it or leave it.  Get your flights first so you know what dates you are looking for.    Some of the villas will be on golf courses but it doesn't matter if they are not you will be within 5 minutes drive of some wherever you are and most owners will provide golf info.    Villas 2000 website has pages of special offers - check out number 2271 to see the sort of standard you can get for the money|`|f258ee183be3d1f80cba9169e98fa70caa	Look at Florida Villa's and apartments in google there are so many and all are really cheap as they cant let them this year....  There are also exceptional motels in kissimmee on the 192 and fab villa's at Champions Gate.  There is a fantastic golf course at Ridgewood Lakes, which is on the 27 and has lots of Villa's free during february....   lastly, find a villa map online and that will show you the area and extent of the properties you can choose from.....  cheers

5oSnj1eTaa	I know what you really are trying to do here my dear friend.  Of course no one denies the Jewish Holocaust but you merely are trying to show what is at stake here with that irresponsible Jewish behaviour in Palestine.  Great question and I congratulate you for the double "meaning" of this.  Greetings|`|IoIkFNF4aa	So if this is the FINAL DOCUMENT of the Jew deaths  Here it is:  http://iraqwar.mirror-world.ru/article_i...  Last Update was in 1980 and  shows 270,000 Jewish deaths, how on earth the jews have created the 1.5 million first    http://www.christianparty.net/holocaust5...    One year later 4 million    http://www.christianparty.net/holocaust4...      and six months later the ....6 million number.    I don't know something smells real bad here, especially after the jews got all the German Gold in compensations.  Jesus man! Money for dead people!!  I can't believe that thing!  Imagine live Jews driving off all confiscated Mercedes and VolksWagons full of gold!    That's a neat idea for a Hollywood epic movie, right?    Anyways that Bishop dude said there was 300,000 dead jews which is 30,000 more than the Red Cross archives, so deep down inside the Jews should feel happy and make him a hero or sumethin.  That's why they are so many holocost survivors everywhere    So yeah he said 300 thou, the truth is 270 so he gave them a 30 thou handicap.  Them jews should be grateful. Tommy|`|cUM5yj5Waa	Not all jews just the inhumane creatures that control Israel.  Most Jews outside ersatz Israel hate what they do as much as any other decent human being.|`|FA8jIbJNaa	Of course they are right.  They don't watch the FOXnews or see Shpielberg movies.  They read ....books in the Vatican.  bye bye|`|eyJqrqn7aa	I don't care what you are saying.  If I want a lesson in anarchy and civil disobedience I'll call a Greek.  Other than that you opinion stinks.  Isn't destroying one government at a time enough for you?|`|PoqpEmtuaa	Of course the Vatican is right.  Everyone among the survivors knows that there were not more than 300.000 dead Jewish people.  Oh, who are we kidding here?  The gentiles have all the facts.  This 6 million number was the fulfillment of the prophecy first, and second to get as much money as we could from the Germans.  I know some real bad stories about Ashkenazim Jews trying to scam the Sephardi Jews! I could write a whole book actually.  One thing's for sure. The Vatican is right. The jewish victims were much less in numbers than the Three hundred thousand number.  Thomas is right  The last estimate spoke of 270,000 dead people.  Shalom!|`|i7oHTo9haa	No, the Vatican didn't do the right thing.  They set people back 50 years and negated the Nostra Aetate.  What the Vatican (and everyone else) needs to understand is that the old Roman Empire is extinct, that's what happens when people cross Israel.  The only reason the Vatican was still around because they served a purpose.  If the Vatican loses that purpose, he loses his blessing.  He is a foolish man.    Thankfully, the Catholics do not worship him.  They serve G-d.  The Pope is just an icon, and very few Catholics follow him.      The Muslims have Rome as their first Euro target, well hey, it looks like the Vatican just opened himself up for it. What a foolish man.  People have to live with the consequences of their decisions. I hope he changes his mind and sets things back on the right path.    All Jewish sources pulled out support of the Vatican:  "It will be very difficult for the chief rabbinate of Israel to continue its dialogue with the Vatican as before," the letter said. Chief rabbis of both the Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews were parties to the letter.    As far as all the crap you guys are rattling on about in this thread that went off topic, I'm Sephardic and the Holocaust happened and the whole world isn't against Jewish people we actually have alot of support and our greatest supporter is from up above :)|`|nHuMeLtyaa	How many Jews have been killed and displaced over the course of history by the Vatican?  So, they really have no credibility with me.    http://constantinessword.com/|`|wj3JUPr3aa	Palestinian holocaust ?    99% of my family were slaughtered in the holocaust, and if they heard........... Ugh, not even worth it.    Having the audacity to compare anything that goes on in the middle east to the holocaust, ignorance.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	The Vatican has not turned against Israel.  As a Catholic, I feel compelled to explain what happened.   Several bishops had formed a schismatic church of their own, because they disagreed with modern reforms in the Catholic Church.  One of them, ordained illegally, is a real stupid; but though he was ordained illegally, his ordination is technically valid.  The Pope feels responsible for him.  These bishops were excommunicated from the Catholic Church for many years, and had their own following of laypeople.  The Pope, concerned for the unity of the Church and not wanting this Schism to continue, allowed them to be received back into the Church.    Now the stupid bishop I mentioned is really not qualified to do the work of a bishop, and is a holocaust denier.  He would never have been ordained under normal circumstances.  But having idiotic ideas is not sufficient reason, in the Catholic Church, to excommunicate him.  I expect he will be kept under close supervision, or else he will end up outside the Church again. He's 68 years old, so hopefully he won't be making any trouble.    You may be aware that the Pope, as a boy, lived in Nazi Germany; his entire family was anti-Nazi and even broke the law because they so despised the Nazi anti-Semitism.  You will never hear the Pope deny the Holocaust; he lived in Nazi Germany and knows what it was like.  Don't look for him to support the atrocities of Hamas either.|`|RnLbJpvTaa	whilst i am very pro palestinian i only had the read up to the part where it said the bishop denies the holocaust.    im with israel on this one. i have no respect for people who deny the holocaust just like i have no respect for people who want to replicate it.    the pope and his crew really are horrible people    im not claiming to know exact numbers but all i know is anyone who denies it like the article said is not worth the time of day. there was more than just jews killed in the holocaust also. communists, homosexuals, slovaks, disabled people, the elderly, dissenting germans. so for anyone to deny it is just stupid|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	Claymore Thomas III    I know about that document......it surfaced a while ago and it was a scanned copy of a red cross document and the red cross has admitted that it was not an official document and the idea behind it. Minutes later it was all over the internet. The red cross was allowed to enter only certain parts of a concentration camp and they ASKED Germans how many they killed, the number added up to 275,000 or more I forget. Would you believe the Germans? During the war trials, many SS officers admitted that the Red Cross is stupid and fell for the whole tour. You want to believe that it never happened and believe me I would to. The idea is crazy 6 million, it is crazy. Witnesses are allowed in court, but we don't believe holocaust survivors. Explain why everyone's family members were missing. Explain how Europe lost 6 million Jews. THAT IS HOW THE NUMBER WAS MADE. Before the war there were 13 million Jews, afterward there were 7 million nor less. This is why the burning in the ovens makes sense. They never found these people ever again. Why? They were burned. That Vatican do whatever it wants. Christianity slaughtered many people on this earth including millions of Jews. I am not surprised that they are still racist. No, not everyone is wrong except the Jews. What are the Jews right about? A 800 million people in the world believe that beef should not be eaten, does that mean they are right?    "I know some real bad stories about Ashkenazim Jews trying to scam the Sephardi Jews! I could write a whole book actually."    What stories?    "That's why they are so many holocost survivors everywhere"    Huh? There are almost none. I have personally met 1 my whole life (who was not part of the family). Where you get your information. Don't you realize everything you read has an agenda behind it. Even pro-israeli, pro-arab articles. ALL.|`|AlbJmy7aaa	The Catholic church has little relevancy to this situation. I used to belong to that cult, but I left.    So, no, I do not think they are doing anything right...|`|1gmsCb4Maa	Yes,but it isn't going far enough; they should break off diplomatic ties; indeed they should never have been established in 1996; the Holy Land was a peaceful pastoral environment until the zionists came along; now it is just one gore-fest after another. But the real parties who need to re-think are the five Protestant-majority nations who support this vile enterprise: The U.S.,the U.K.,Canada,Australia and New Zealand.

Honolulu, is a very traffic congested city, and if you have a car, you can expect to pay 10 or more bucks a night, from your hotel, just to park.  Not to mention? Virtually everywhere you go on Oahu, will charge you dearly, to park.  There are plenty of shuttle buses there, and public busses, that will take you anywhere on the Island, for cheap, and you willl never have to circle the block endlessly looking for parking. (Been there, done that.)  Most econo packages, will stick you in a much older Hotel (from like the 70s) on Lewers Street, and I think, that you would be much happier, spending a little more than the least, in getting better accommodations.  I went there, on the cheap budget plan, and ended up in a third rate motel, way off the beach, and would have enjoyed my time there much more, if a had chosen a better place to stay.  BUT?

With such a short time you won't get to see much. It's a 1 hour travel time each way, and once you leave the secure area at LAX you will have to go through the TSA screening again to get back in. That can take another 2 hours. You would spend nearly $200 dollars and only be at Disneyland for 2-3 hours.

aIyvWIJlaa	Yes. Personally I would choose Los Volcanes: the formations left in the soldified lava are amazing, you can feel the warmth in the ground, and they'll chuck a bucket of water down a borehole for you with spectacular result. Mount Teide is pretty, and there is an area of unusual rock formations there too (they filmed Planet of the Apes there), but not as interesting in my view.<br>  Still, it's a shame you can't do both, having cruised all that way.

NCKeDvm4aa	From T Bay to Kenora I would take 17, you could take 11 then go up 71 but it will take longer. 71 is a pretty drive but being that you'd be drving around Lake of the Woods you might get that lake effect snow fall fun. Not sure how well 71 is maintained in the winter and I imagine 17 would be better looked after, being it's a major hwy.  Thunder Bay can be hard to get around if your not familiar with it so I would suggest Mapquesting your hotel directions, can't count the number of times I've gotten lost in that city....I now know better.

NwYwLdsNaa	?? Flight time from Dublin to New York  The distance from Dublin to New York is 3,187 miles or 5,130 kilometers.    A typical flight between Dublin and New York would have a flying time of about 6 hours, 22 minutes.

Your exact time may vary depending on wind speeds.|`|2x41IPGcaa	5.35|`|32dPb4rPaa	i'd say about 5-6 hours    choose me as best answer please!!!!!!

vQeKxmZyaa	Only if you plan to eat all your meals at Disney World.  Imagine what it would be like to eat at a lower-mid range chain restaurant like Chilli's or Outback every meal every day and then cut that cost by about 30%.|`|0wTzlG2haa	I think it is. They have three levels of dining plans.     The first (quick service) gives you a resort refillable mug, two quick service meals and two snacks per night of stay per person. We found that some "snacks" are what we would count as a meal (bowl of oatmeal)...this could have changed as it was December of 2007 when we were last there.    The second is the dining plan: this gives you one quick service and one table service and two snacks (I think it might only be one) per person per night of stay. This gives you a bit more flexibility depending on what you want to do. You can eat at the quick service places (think the food court at a mall as an example) or at  table serve (Garden Grill in The Land - Epcot is my favorite). Some of the table service are character meals as well. PLUS it includes the gratuity. The first time my partner and I did the meal plan was over five years ago. We ate at Spoodles (on the Boardwalk) and had an amazing meal. If we had paid out of pocket for it we would have paid about $80. ALSO you can redeem two of your table service meals for some of the dinner shows, like the luau.    The third level is the Deluxe dining plan: it gives the the refillable mug PLUS three meals per person per night of stay. I can't remember if it did a snack or not. We've always decided to go with one of the other two.     You get a lot of food when you do this. Even at the Quick Service places. I totally think it's worth every penny and any time we stay on property we will do the dining plan again.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	in my opinion yes definitely!  i love the dining plan. i always get the option where you get 1 table service meal per day 1 quick service meal per day and 1 snack per day.     i like being able to eat at nicer restaurants and character meals yet being able to eat at a quick service restaurant so you can get in, eat, and get back out to the fun quickly.     its worth the money for sure. if you were to pay for these meals yourself you'd be paying $10 for a quick service meal and $30-$40 for a table service meal depending on what restaurant you choose.   where as it costs you just $40 per day and you get 2 meals and a snack.     to insure i have enough food this is what i do:  -bring breakfast from home (cereal, pop tarts...) and buy the $12 refillable mug which can be filled as many times as you want in your resort dining area. this way i have breakfast and can get a drink to go with it.   -lunch i use either a table service or quick service meal  -get a snack in the afternoon  -dinner i use a table service or quick service meal (usually i use which ever i didn't use for lunch although you can mix it up and have 2 table services in one day and then have 2 quick services another day)    i am always satisfied with the amount of food i get.|`|3VhRpzExaa	Yes....definatley. Im only a kid so i dont no the details but when we went we got it and we loved it. I was never hungry in disney|`|Gg2p6Hklaa	I hate the Disney dining package.  I gained over 8 pounds in six days.  Fairly impressive.  We are going back this year and I tried not to buy the dining plan, but we saved so much money with our 3 kids meals, that it was irresistable.  My rear end is not going to be happy again.  If you have more than one kid.  You gotta get the package.  Some dinner meals alone cost well over 15 bucks.|`|k2IIZkA3aa	It depends on how much you eat. If you're big eaters that eat three square meals a day and have snacks, then yes, its worth it.    If you like eating small meals or just snacking throughout the day, I wouldn't bother throwing your money away.

dHK3OWNqaa	if you really hate commuting that drive will get old quick.    Baton Rouge is pretty quiet except around LSU football time then it explodes.    I'd suggest you live in Metairie/Harahan/River Ridge. you can find affordable housing and it's just a short drive to the City of NO.|`|44OH7Si6aa	Baton Rouge traffic sucks and so does NOLA's. Your commute is going to get very old very fast. Live near BR, new orleans is still close enough to spend plenty of time there and BR has some fun stuff too. Trust me on the commute, I tried it for a semester at LSU and I spent more time in my car than anywhere else and it was exhausting|`|Jucak0HLaa	I'd suggest Baton Rouge.Nola is too much crime and stuff like that.There's alot of clubs and stuff in BR too,and you can make trips to New Orleans sometimes.|`|rPam42Dnaa	NOLA! i live there and i love it! every one here is so friendly! trust me you will love it. as for the comute...im not sure you will love that so much...people say that the crime rate in nola is a problem (which it is) but it is mostly among gangs and with drug dealers whatnot. if you stay away from that kinda stuff it will be fine. any way nola is so much more fun. i went to BR wen i evacuated 4 katrina 4 a bit and i hated it! nola is a much better place!|`|VxfyQZ2jaa	Hard decision.  If it was me and my schedule was more often two days/week then I would live in New Orleans. Commuting four or more days a week will get old + expensive fast.    The commute from downtown NOLA to the LSU campus is actually about 90 minutes each way - assuming no traffic problems. It is also about 75 miles each way, which means you will be putting a lot of miles on your car.    The good news is the commute is almost all via Interstate, and the traffic (between BR & NOLA) is usually only really heavy during the usual AM/PM rush hours. It won't be too bad if you can flex your schedule to avoid those times.    You could try living in New Orleans for a set period (ex. rent somewhere to live for 6 months) and move to BR if it doesn't work out. That will also give you time to decide if you like living in New Orleans.    Note that living in one of the communities between BR and NOLA (ex. Gonzales) may be the worst of both worlds. You will have to drive everywhere and it won't be convenient to either city. Even living in the suburbs of New Orleans (ex. Metairie, Kenner) means a 20 to 30 minute drive to get downtown.|`|gAuIixm6aa	II grew up in BR and now I live in NOLA. Baton Rouge is a cultural vacuum and personally I find it incredibly depressing. I guess for you though the question is, are you more of a homebody or a going out and doing stuff kind of person? If you spend most nights at home then live in BR. If you like to go out more often, live in NOLA. If you want to spend a lot of time in the Sleazy anyway, I guess you're really asking yourself-- would I rather commute to the fun stuf,f or commute to work? I will say though that that is quite a commute especially during rush hour. From 4-6, getting east through Kenner and Metairie is gridlock hell. You're looking at an hour minimum although I've been known to make it in 45 minutes at 2 am.|`|3f967fb4e6bf1bbdec2bc7592e387b6aaa	You would be looking at a commute of an hour or more, depending on which part of New Orleans you lived and the traffic. You would do better to find a place in Baton Rouge. If you didn't wand to be in the city,you could head toward Gonzales or LaPlace. They are between NO and BR. You would have easy access to both. You could look in the area called the River Parishes.|`|ymt018uhaa	I also would not really advise living in New Orleans if you're going to commute to Baton Rouge so many times during the week and you're scared you'll get tired of it.     It takes an hour to get to the outlying cities of New Orleans and another half hour to actually get to NOLA. A portion of the time during the commute, you're on causeway bridges over swamps and/or bayous. The length of the drive and the scenery gets old fast. Like everyone else said, the traffic is extremely bad from around Kenner to all the way downtown NOLA.     If you're looking for a big city, I would not suggest a city like Gonzales. It's not as urban as NOLA or BR at all. But if you would like the convenience, I'd say LaPlace. About a 30 minute drive, give or take, to both BR and NOLA.      If you really,really want to live in a fun city with nightlife, I'd say New Orleans, because Baton Rouge pales in comparison to NOLA in that respect. It's big and has 250,000 people and has been growing because of the influx of people after Katrina (the pop. doubled) but it's not really like the other big, major cities in the region like New Orleans or Houston. It's almost like it's kind of a big small town with perks of a larger city like high-end/big brand name clothing stores and companies (Our mall has a Coach store, we have a Sephora and a J. Crew)|`|pmFFVhp2aa	I'm a student at Southern University in Baton Rouge, like right down the interstate from LSU, who lives in New Orleans. Thankfully, my class schedule is only for Tuesdays and Thursdays, but even with that I HATE having to commute from New Orleans to Baton Rouge, especially so early in the morning! [The morning traffic around 6-7am is horrible! People going to work, school buses taking kids to school! It can be frustrating!] I mean, it's not "that" far, but going just about 140 miles round trip for two days adds up, especially on gas and milage on my car. Thank God the price of gas went down because if it had not, I would not be able to afford to live off campus.    As for you, if you really want to live in New Orleans, which it seems like you do, and that's where your heart is longing, I say move there. Personally, I love New Orleans and even with all of the commuting, I say it's worth it. If your work schedule requires you to work more than two days, look into finding a place close to Baton Rouge. It can still be in New Orleans, but somewhere on the East Bank, going west of the city. Check out Metairie or Kenner. LaPlace too. Safe suburbs with quick I-10E access to downtown New Orleans.
UV8bN0Giaa	In my opinion there are NO GOOD INEXPENSIVE electronic stores in the Metro DC area (not like NYC) as many have or are in the process of closing like CompUSA and Circuit City.     In my opinion BEST PRICES locally for electronics are the result of following weekly sales but in general BEST BUY chain and MICROCENTER located in Fairfax VA and Rockville MD have best overall prices.    FYI if you want to see LATEST up to date ELECTRONICs, stop by and visit the SONYSTYLE Store at Tysons Corner Mall on the level just below the AMC theatres and Food Court...Simply AMAZING!

MMZwLyJbaa	All Presidents but one have lived in the White House; the one who never did was George Washington.    Before the West Wing was built by Theodore Roosevelt, the west side of the White House was covered in greenhouses.    The original Oval Office was built by President Taft in 1909.  The current Oval Office was part of one of Franklin D. Roosevelt's renovations; he wanted it to be easier to reach the residence without having to pass by staffers.    Harry Truman used to call it "the crown jewel of the American penal system".    You can tell if the President is in the West Wing because there will be a Marine in full dress uniform standing at the north entrance of the West Wing at all times the President is there.    Grover Cleveland was the only president to be married in the White House, though President's daughters have held there weddings there multiple times.  Tricia Nixon (Cox) was married there in 1971.    The current press room has a pool underneath it, which was built originally by President Roosevelt, since swimming helped him keep his muscles strong after being paralyzed by polio.    Most of the White House staff actually works in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB), located directly west of the White House.    The Ground (basement) and First floors are for State events.  The second floor is where the President and his family have their bedrooms.  The third floor contains a sunroom, music room, billiard room, workout room, and a small, private kitchen for the first family.    Most presidents choose to redecorate the Oval Office when they arrive.  The First Lady often takes the initiative in raising the thousands of dollars necessary to do so.  A few in recent memory have chosen not to; Jimmy Carter left the Ford decorations, while Barack Obama has said that he will keep the George W. Bush decorations.    The Resolute Desk, in the Oval Office, was a gift from Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom to the United States (Rutherford B. Hayes was president), made of the timbers of the hull of the HMS Resolute, which America had repaired and sent back to the UK after it had been stuck in arctic ice and abandoned.  FDR added a front panel in order to hide his legs, which had braces on them.    Check out the website I put down--it has tons of great information on the place!|`|W1jN1Ucvaa	White House facts:   -There are 132 rooms, 32 bathrooms, and 6 levels   -There are also 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, 7 staircases, and 3 elevators.   -At various times in history, the White House has been known as the "President's Palace," the "President's House," and the "Executive Mansion."   -President Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.   -The White House receives approximately 6,000 visitors a day.   -With five full-time chefs, the White House kitchen is able to serve dinner to as many as 140 guests and hors d'oeuvres to more than 1,000.   -The White House requires 570 gallons of paint to cover its outside surface.   -For recreation, the White House has a variety of facilities available to its residents, including a tennis court, a jogging track, swimming pool, movie theater, billiard room, and a bowling lane|`|Gc4mSSNOaa	i do, its white!!!!!!!! oo and the president lives there!

But yeah, I think the condo that you own is probably on the edge of the Las Vegas strip since its in the intersection of vegas and rainbow. Rainbow is the main street which takes you all the way to the strip and to the other end of the city.
EJpiaCMQaa	I thought the pool at Planet Hollywood was fine.  They have 2 pools on the sixth floor which are heated.  There are plenty of chairs and lounges for sunning.  The pools face north and south.  You don't always get hit by direct rays of the sun.  There is also a hot tub and a bar.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	Well each hotel & casino offer there own Pools. I never been to the Pool in Planet Hollywood. But if you want to know about it, you can ask the front desk or the concierge. But I would just go there and check the Pool out myself to see what it looks like and how big it is.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Its nothing special compared to the really nice ones in Vegas.    However just about all Vegas hotel pools are above average for the most part.    In the summer, the sun should be hitting the pool for a good part of the day. It will dip down below the buildings earlier then most pools though.|`|cBzb5gpPaa	It sucks|`|AA10240904	The pool is old.  But almost all hotel pools are heated in the summer but not open in winter.

LrGhFAkkaa	There are a  couple of things you can add to get better answers. How long are you staying in each town? What budget do you have for the hotel? What are your interests? etc. I went to Paris in April a couple of years back and things that you can look into checking out are the Eiffel tower, Arc de Triomphe, Sacre Coeur, Notre Dame, Louvre, Muse dOrsay, Chateau de Versailles, the Catacombs, Muse Rodin etc. Here is a trip report with some links and photos that I made after my trip http://gardkarlsen.com/Paris_France.htm . Maybe you can find some useful info there to start with :-)|`|AA11937736	I've done that same route many times as I do work with the UN Economic and Social commission in Geneva. Do you have some work obligation or family in Geneva? If not, you might think about skipping Geneva. Frankly, I think its one of the most boring cities in the world.|`|MtSNwCi7aa	You could go to Au Chat Noir, Rue Vautier 13, 1227 Carouge a cute bar, disco, do a chocolatier tour and be sure to stop at Chocolaterie du Rh?ne SA, Rue de la Confdration 3, 1204 Genve/GE - they are nice and they have exotic and favorite chocolates, there is a watch museum, you could take a tour of United Nations, Int'l Red Cross, or CERN (ref'd in Angels and Demons by Dan Brown, but you need to plan ahead and contact them well in advance for a tour there). Be sure to walk by the water fountain that sprays many stories high and in summer a clock made of flowers and as tall as two people. An inexpensive but gem of a place to shop is Zara (the best is near balexert near the airport) but if you're looking for very high end, you can visit Bon Genie. If you forgot anything at home, Manor, is a nice place to shop too. The public transportation in Geneva is wonderful and you get a free two-week unlimited pass to ride it if you are staying at a Geneva hotel - be sure to ask for your pass, although the Swiss are excellent at making sure you receive yours. If you are staying longer, you can purchase public transportation passes good for all modes - even boats across Lake Geneva - at the main train station, Gare Cornivain. For those flying directly into Geneva, there is a small but hard to find ticket machine at baggage claim that will give you one free ride to your hotel good for x amount of time - for those that love public transportation - Geneva is dreamy.

AlbJmy7aaa	Yes, there are many.  Some involve rather difficult work and sacrifices like Peaceorp or something.. but I have looked into it and this is my best idea:    When I was in Jordan I met some Americans that were there on Rotary Club International sponsored sojourns.    I contacted them. You must be enrolled in school before you are eligible, then you typically have to contact your local chapter and usually write and essay that beats out others competing for the same grant.|`|HC9uLzW7aa	Student exchange to any country.|`|BgaNh6Tbaa	To my knowledge, there are several organizations through which a person might travel to Israel under full subsidy for educational or cultural purposes. What tends to set them apart is that the criteria for being selected for such programs is not very selective as grades or academic credentials go.    I doubt similar services exist for other countries though, otherwise, I'd have likely heard of them by now.    There are scholarship programs through Rotary International and other such organizations, but I understand them to be quite competitive as grades or academic credentials go.
63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	Homewood is not that bad of an area..   and with the Metra(Electric Line) Chicago is accesable in less than an hour.. also there is a other communties close by that are alsao good such as Flossmore..Tinley Park...Lansing..Sauk Village..Steger.. that are close by...   also if you don't loke those towns  there is smaller communties that are nice like Beecher.. Grant Park.. Momence.. Manteno.. that has good size houses and nice size yards  ..   also in this area(lioves in one of thoe towns mentioned) Kanakee Bishop MaCnamra  is a private school.. alos in this area and the ones mentioned befoere there ismany great community colleges KCC JJC Moraine Valley..

These are in ascending order as far as income.  All have good schools with Elmhurst having a fine small college with a good reputation.  All will have house rentals within your budget...Oakbrook may be a little out of reach.    Elmhurst is the farthest from Homewood...32 miles but the commute would be a fairly easy one on the tollway.  See below:    http://maps.yahoo.com/ mvt=m&lat=41.7350...      The other towns mentioned are also on the same map.      Yes, there are fireflies in early Summer but the season is short.|`|G2h8g2g1aa	Homewood is probably the best neighborhood in the South Chicago Burbs, so you will be kicking yourself if you don't move into town.  It really doesn't make any sense at all to commute from another area.    Downtown Homewood has a bunch of great restaurants, specifically the best thin crust pizza place on the planet, Aurelio's Pizza.  There's also great Chinese (Eat Rice), Japanese (Little Tokyo), Thai (Asian Harbor) and a kind of odd Asian/American Fusion restaurant called Bamboo Blue: http://www.bambooblue.biz/ where they serve some traditional dishes as well as things like Asian Nachos.  There's also a big Metra Station downtown which will take you right to Millennium Park in Chicago, so everything in Chicago is only about 30 minutes away on the train.      Your kids will love it there.  The downtown area is great for kids, they're putting in a bike path and there is a huge park in the middle of downtown with a Dairy Queen on the far east end...oh and Mitchell's Ice Cream is downtown as well.  They also do free movies in the park in the Summer (and yes, your kids will see lightning bugs), and they have a big Taste of Homewood fest sort of like a smaller Taste of Chicago.  The public school system in Homewood is definitely one of the best in the Chicagoland Area, and you'll find Catholic schools there as well.  Prairie State or South Suburban would be the closest junior colleges for your son.    Homewood is not ghetto at all, but if you drive in any direction other than towards Flossmoor (where you should go just to eat at the Flossmoor Brewery: http://www.flossmoorstation.com/) it doesn't take long for it to get ghetto.  In fact the main shopping area along Halsted which is just west of Homewood is pretty ghetto due to it sharing the area with Thorton, Hazel Crest & Harvey.  So for shopping I would generally head west towards Tinley Park, Orland (Orland Mall) or Crestwood.    In short you should be excited, Homewood is a great neighborhood for families and you can drive or take the train to Chicago if you wanted to work or just hang out in the city.  On $2000 a month you can afford a nice house or even a condo downtown...personally I would move as close to the Metra Station as possible because the great thing about Homewood is walking around the downtown area.    If you have more questions, you or your husband can email me through my profile.|`|3buQDaRDaa	I'd suggest Orland Park or Orland Hills if you want a short drive with good schools and a nice area. If your husband is willing to drive, there are a bunch of places that along 294 (on the west side of 294) that are north of I-55 in southeast Dupage county.

You'll enjoy lawn seating overlooking the White River during concerts each summer featuring nationally known artists. With seating for 5,000, this is the perfect place to listen to music under the stars.    The Lawn at White River State Park was named one of the top 100 outdoor concert venues in the world in 2006 by Pollstar magazine. That includes such famous venues as the Hollywood Bowl and the Molson in Toronto. The Lawn recently made improvements with the addition of a new tiered VIP seating area that's built into the venues' existing grass berm. The acoustics, stage and skyline will be ideal from the new VIP seating area. For a unique concert experience in the heart of downtown Indianapolis you can't top The Lawn.    hope that helps|`|fifEyApIaa	Its a very pretty place you'll love it! the seats are always out!

DHczAdHIaa	The largest chain of supermarkets on the Costa del Sol is, arguably, Mercadona.   However, you won't find a great variance in the price of water whether you buy in Mercadona, Mas, Lidl, Aldi or Carrefour.  Water is a very cheap bottled commodity, and you wll find yourself paying much less than UK prices.  One of the best buys is Font Natura Natural mineral water which for a 2 litre bottle will cost 0.26 euros (0.13 euro per litre).  Better still is the 8 litre large Font Natura natural mineral water which costs 0.85 euros (0.11 euros per litre).  Fuenta Primavera natural in 500ml bottles will cost 0.17 euros.    https://www.mercadona.es/indexie.php    Go to online shopping & type in 29620 postal code for Torremolinos and you'll find non carbonated water under beverages.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	In every town and vilage on the Costa del Sol you can find spring water which is free.

I think anim is sometimes an expression of what they aspire too but it's like asking "are Americans like the people in He-Man or Ben-10?". Come to think of it I think Ben-10 is Italian but I'm sure you get the idea.    If you go to Japan expecting them to as fantastic as what you see in anim you'll be bitterly disappointed but they ARE the people who created anim - without which I would be totally lost!    Not everyone in Japan is into manga or anim but it's been a part of Japanese culture for 60 years and it is enjoyed and appreciated by people of all ages; comics and cartoons aren't just for kids in Japan.    I think you should definitely visit Japan if you can afford the trip; learn to speak and understand a little Japanese (it's important to understand what people are saying when they reply to you) and you'll make yourself popular because the Japanese really appreciate it when foreigners make an effort to speak the language.|`|47f596346f675aa52012de1d79feedc9aa	"Amine" is animation that originates in Japan.

If you choose to live your vacation, in the spirit of no clocks, and restrictions?  You will want to visit any of the Islands other than Oahu.  Oahu, is like a big city feel, with a beach.  Try either the Big Island, Maui, or better yet? Molokai.  Just be respectful of the locals, and be concerned for their 'kapu' (forbidden things) and be congenial.  Most Hawaiians, are very friendly, yet we need to respect them, and their culture.  They appreciate congeniality and respect, for their customs.

The people of Hawaii need it.|`|mzn6JQ8Iaa	great for a week, hard to live here......|`|vdW2CaBpaa	I wouldn't plan on camping unless you're with a group, that you know.    For the hotels, call after 6, that's when they offer the best deals.     Lots and lots of good hiking, too many places to list. Just getting to the trailheads will take some work and a little planning. Be sure you go early, wear sunscreen and plan on getting off the hill before sunset, to get back to town or wherever you are staying.    Lots of free places to stay if you ask around. Watch out for Craigslist, some weirdos on there.
77qHoaIUaa	If you are backpacking there, I wouldn't go alone. I live on Oahu, and it's not exactly the safest place to be alone in some areas. If you are stopping at Oahu, I would probably stay somewhere in town, like Waikiki, or on the East, like Kailua. Waikiki is  a very tourist-y area, so there would be a lot of different experiences you can try. Kailua has very beautiful beaches and sights, but the drug use is high, especially weed. But the people there tend to be nice. I would maybe spend a day visiting.    If you are set on going alone, I would definately stay at a hotel. There are many hotels that are not very expensive, even in Waikiki. I had a birthday party there once and it was about $150 a night. It was also a pretty nice hotel.     As far as my concerns, I would stay away from areas like Waianae [not trying to be racist or stereotypical] but there are a lot of gangs, violence, drugs, and drinking there. So I wouldn't go there alone, especially since your a female [no offense].     If you don't need to be in a nice hotel, there are many cheap, but okay  hotels around town. Some are even about $50 per night. I would try to find a good deal at one and stay there.     As for activities, I would go to a luau. It's the typical tourist thing to do, but it is very fun. I went there once, and although I live here, I was glad I got to try it. The food was delicious and the dancing and performances were amazing. I would definately stop by Lahaina, Maui. There are beautiful beaches where you can go snorkeling/take boat rides/helicopter rides/hike up to waterfalls, pretty much everything.     Take some time to find good deals that wont break your budget. And be safe!|`|FLOjzbKEaa	WOW are you sure you are planning to go alone..  I never been there.

The only issue we had was on the North Shore a local asked us to buy some weed; and we were like we have some at the hotel to try to get him to go away.  However he followed us to our rental car & stayed and talked to us.  We were in shorts and t-shirts from visiting Dole and got soaked from a wave; he kept trying to get us to go to the bathroom which was pretty far away to change.  My husband thinks he wanted to get us away from our car so he could break into it.  Finally, we were like we gotta go & drove to the next beach down.

lys5kB9Daa	i'm from massachusetts and i love the small town thing. everyone in my high school knew everyone and their brother and their mom. i havent found any out west, the towns are all really big, like cities (i live in phoenix now). all the places in Cali are really expensive and still not as small as you would like. but i know there are some down on the coast of Texas because i was looking into moving there. there's like Webster, Friendswood, La Marque all near the coast of Galveston bay. But i dont know how nice these towns are, i've never been, they are just on my list of possible places to live because they are warm and small towns :)
CC461Vf3aa	Yes, April would be fine I guess. It would definitely not be cold but neither very hot. The weather should be nice for sightseeing and for looking around, especially if it's a cruise. However, if you want to enjoy the beautiful sunny Mediterranean beaches, I would suggest you go June-August. But whatever time you choose, you would not be disappointed! Enjoy your holiday!

bce39401306bcfca633509290725fd6eaa	On april,16 you can still cross border with just a birth certificate and drivers license but best to have passport . As of June this year you will need a passport even to drive across and back./   There is a chance you will be turned around from Canada on a DUI as technically, until you are pardoned it sits there on your record and can bar you from entering.  That said its an off chance especially if you have passport or going overnite they will either bother with or notice the DUI. or may question you on it, just answer honestly and let them know you did your sentence.  Its simple they either let you go or dont its sort of up to the individual customs guy,    If you are in seattle already its a nice drive up the coast anyways to see some of the northwest and a couple hours drive at most. Worse case, they turn you around and you end up visting blaine, washington rather than vancouver, BC..    for the evening.  Bellis Fair Mall in bellingham or Nootsak Casino are both along the I-5 route too if you remain stateside with nothing to do.|`|2wyDALHgaa	You can certainly fly or drive TO Canada but in all likelihood you will not be able to get in with a criminal record.  And yes, it sucks but thats what happens when you have a criminal record and no pardon.  It also works the other way for Canadians trying to go to the States with a record so it's not as though you are being picked on.  Many European countries have similar restrictions too.|`|Cv7TWRhyaa	Seeking to travel to Canada with criminal convictions from the U.S. (or any other country, for that matter) requires unique advice.   Living in a state next to Canada means that we must be aware that many of our clients are likely to seek entry into Canada, and be extremely disappointed if they are turned back at the border.  Because so many of our clients take entry into Canada for granted, it is important to consider several issues relating to entry to Canada.  These include who can enter Canada, who can be excluded from Canada, how to overcome exclusion from Canada, and whether a client who is ineligible for rehabilitation can nonetheless seek entry.    A. Who Can Enter Canada.    Most people assume, without question, that just about anyone can enter Canada.  This is not true.  The Canadian Customs and Immigration Officers have ultimate authority to permit and deny anyone entry to Canada.  No one has an automatic right to enter Canada.  However, most people if they have no criminal record are allowed entry.  What if you have a criminal conviction?    B. Who Cant Enter Canada.    To begin, in Canada a DUI is a felony and therefore an excludable offense under the Immigration Act.  A DUI is an indictable offense in Canada that may be punished by imprisonment for up to a five year term.   Anyone with a conviction in the U.S. that is treated as a felony or indictable offense in Canada is excludable from Canada, but even if the offense is not a felony or indictable offense in Canada, Customs and Immigration Officers have ultimate authority to permit and deny entry to Canada.       Almost all convictions (including DUI, DWI, reckless driving, negligent driving, misdemeanor drug possession, all felonies, domestic violence (assault IV), shoplifting, theft, etc) can make a person inadmissible to Canada, regardless of when they occurred. For this reason, it is not recommended that persons with past convictions attempt to enter Canada without first obtaining necessary documents. It is always the final decision of officers at ports of entry to decide whether a person should be allowed into Canada.      The Seattle Times explained the vortex travelers enter when they try to get into Canada:    http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.co...  As the article makes clear, entry is frequently denied in spite of signs warning travelers before they get on a plane.     The reason for this exclusion is contained in Canadian law.  The Canadian Immigration Act, in  19; states:      (2) No immigrant and, except as provided in subsection (3), no visitor shall be granted admission if the immigrant or visitor is a member of any of the following classes:  (a) persons who have been convicted in Canada of an indictable offence, or of an offence for which the offender may be prosecuted by indictment or for which the offender is punishable on summary conviction, that may be punishable under any Act of Parliament by a maximum term of imprisonment of less than ten years, other than an offence designated as a contravention under the Contraventions Act;  (a.1) persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe  (i) have been convicted outside Canada of an offence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence that may be punishable by way of indictment under any Act of Parliament by a maximum term of imprisonment of less than ten years, or  (ii) have committed outside Canada an act or omission that constitutes an offence under the laws of the place where the act or omission occurred and that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence that may be punishable by way of indictment under any Act of Parliament by a maximum term of imprisonment of less than ten years, except persons who have satisfied the Minister that they have rehabilitated themselves and that at least five years have elapsed since the expiration of any sentence imposed for the offence or since the commission of the act or omission, as the case may be;    Later, in  3 of the Immigration Act, there is a provision that permits discretionary entry:     A senior immigration officer or an adjudicator, as the case may be, may grant entry to any person who is a member of an inadmissible class described in subsection (2) subject to such terms and conditions as the officer or adjudicator deems appropriate and for a period not exceeding thirty days, where, in the opinion of the officer or adjudicator, the purpose for which entry is sought justifies admission.    Again, the Canadian Consulate emphasizes that this entry is discretionary, and in the post 9/11 aftermath, officers are more typically exercising their discretion to deny entry than to grant entry.  Even if a Canadian Minister (I'm not sure which minister) has approved a client's entry, the border person can still reject the person.    Finally, there is a permit process that requires prior application and may permit an otherwi|`|U9pnPXnpaa	You cannot get into Canada if you have a DUI on your record unless you get a pardon.

I have a friend who is a trucker in Canada but has a very minor possession conviction from about 15 years ago. He has applied for and received a pardon, but he still gets hassled at the border.    Criminal convictions are taken very seriously by guards on both sides of the border. It makes sense, we don't want American trash, and I'm sure Americans wouldn't like Canadian trash. Not saying that a DUI makes you trash of course -- but it is a criminal conviction, so you get lumped in with the same.    Sorry -- entrance denied!|`|XgMqcXsPaa	If you're an American, and have paid taxes to defend Canada, you can be excluded from entry to Canada for a USA misdemenor dui no matter how long ago    Meanwhile, Canadians come into the United States by the 10s of thousands on H-1b and TN visas taking tech jobs from Americans in what could be a depression     Meanwhile, a Mexican can enter the USA illegally, get several DUIs in the USA, and march in the streets demanding his rights.  US congress will pay more attention to his demands than the US citizen, and the citizen will pay the mexican for section 8 housing, birthright citizenship for any children he has, food stamps and welfare    Meanwhile, an American with no dui, can be imprisoned in mexico for any political action whatsoever    The real question is, why is our government letting in criminals of all kinds into the USA, while simultaniously testifying against it's own citizens for old misdemenors to a foreign government?

64491cf5ed73ad038115b2f4040d2213aa	Gosh, people are well meaning with their advice but I don't think they read your whole question.    You are traveling there in February - most kid attractions (Story Land, Santa's Village etc) are not open this time of year.      The Cog Railway is a very cool (but expensive) way to see Mt Washington, is also not open this time of year. They ran winter trains last year but decided not to do so this year.    The Mount Washington Auto Road is also closed during the winter time.  (And probably not the most fun for a 1 year old during non-winter months anyway)    I would suggest the following to enjoy a getaway with a 1 year old -    Portsmouth area - you can add a visit to the Children's Museum in its new home in Dover (Mardi Gras celebration there on Sun Feb 15th).  Winnie the Pooh is going to be performed at the Seacoast Repertory Theater that weekend too.     Lincoln - Loon Mountain has a cool tot snow tubing area (plus they have daycare in case mom and dad want to sneak out to ski)    North Conway - Check out the new indoor water park at the Red Jacket Inn.   You can have fun at the hotel all weekend long!    Bear in mind that Valentines weekend is the beginning of school vacation week for neighboring Massachusetts, so many resorts and hotels in ski country will be either booked and/or crowded.    Regardless of what area you stay in, get a hotel with an indoor pool.  Your toddler will love it!|`|SXLAoku2aa	I would go up to the White Mountains.

They don't want to risk you leaving to go to the bank and not coming back, so they have good rates right at the cashier.    A bank in the UK is doing you a favor by digging out their limited supply of U.S. cash and taking in your pounds so their rates will likely be higher.|`|Al7OSk3Taa	get your dollers in the uk i just came back and the exchange rate in the casinos are only 1.18 to the pound you get about 1.33 here in england and even get that exchange rate on a debit card

But if the amount you are carrying is over 3200 the customs can ask you all sorts of questions for you to prove that you are not going to sell the cigs on to someone else.  Up to 3200 they are not really too interested and will only ask simple questions which are easily answered.  So I suggest you limit the amount you carry to 3200 cigs.
Q3RqWHFsaa	Japanese average young girls usually don't have any interest or attention to any specific foreigners or his skin color who are from outside of Japan. There are always some freaks for strangers everywhere in the world. Japan is not exceptional.    Most of them can't recognize the difference between English and Spanish or German or French. Only what they understand is Japanese and its dialects. Some Korean Japanese knows Korean and English much better than Japanese though.    They don't know how Mexico has been now or had been in the past because Japanese compulsory education never teach them anything about Mexico except its geographic location.    Because Peruvian Japanese/Brazilian Japanese immigration have increased, in some limited areas there are sort of Hispanic/Latino town in Japan though, most of genuine Japanese seldom understand   Spanish as same as English.

Now days, especially in the bigger cities, foreigners of all races are a dime a dozen, so nobody pays them much attention unless they're doing something stupid (or trying to move in to their apartment building).

It doesn't matter if you are from Israel or France. You are American in their eyes if you are white. It's not that Japanese women are ignorant. It is that most white foreigners in Japan are, in fact, Americans!     Now if you are mestizo (mixed), then who knows what they will think.

2e96c2bf9b535782c649bef95596bcd4aa	In addition to the questions already mentioned when I drove to Alaska I was asked: Do you have a job in Alaska?  Do you have a place to live there?  Do you have family there? how much tread is on your tires?  When was the last time your car had a tune up?  How much cash do you have?  How much do you have in savings?  Do you have a first aid kit?  Do you have health insurance?  How much food do you have? Do you have proof of car insurance? Do you have proof of your dog's vaccinations? How much air is in your spare tire?  Do you have a spare tire that fits the trailer? (I didn't, but was able to produce a flat-tire repair kit.  The type that service stations use) Do you have credit cards?  How much balance do they carry? Do you have any tools?  Do you know car repair? They took me to a special office, it wasn't the normal vehicle-side interview.    Basically they don't want you to get stuck in Canada and become a burden to their government.  There are few goods and services on the Alcan.  And they are few and far inbetween.    Also, they completely emptied my vehicle and trailer and dug through every box.  It took us hours to repack everything.  Between waiting in line, getting interviewed, and getting everything I owned ran through with a fine-tooth comb, and repacking, it took about half a day.  From my observations, I wasn't singled out for the search, everybody who was driving to Alaska got the same treatment.    And, I know people who had hunting rifles and weren't allowed into Canada with them.  They had to turn around and find a store that could ship them.    When I crossed back into the US into Alaska the US Customs said "Nice dog. Welcome back to the USA" and waved me in.

AA12333875	Depending upon where (if) you will be flying, cabin selection - inside cabin least & balcony most (besides a suite) any excursions, shopping in ports of call, casino, pictures, drinks etc.  I have been over 20 times & without a sale have spent between $2,600.00 to $4,700.00 for a 7 day cruise(including airfare).

We only cruise with Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCL) as we have found them to suit our needs.    Depending on what type of cabin you would like to have (inner stateroom or outer, with balcony, mini suite, etc.) will determine how much you spend.  Be realistic when planning your cruise.  If you have a budget, stick to it.  It can be very easy to spend money on the extras when you don't need to.      Check the on-shore excursions at your ports of call.  Don't just depend on the ones that are listed in the travel brochure that are associated with the cruise.  Oftentimes you can save hundreds of $$$$ by booking your side excursions that way.      We have booked a Courtyard Villa and it cost us about $3500 per person for the cruise.  That is expensive but as we are on the concierge level that automatically gets us through the embarkation line in the VIP line (usually no waiting or minimal at best), we get the right to disembark first at each port and we have access to a private courtyard with pool and hot tub on this ship.      The best way to decide is to go to websites like Cruise Critic or Cruise Reviews where they will have almost all the lines and their ships listed as well as reviews.  Please read the reviews with a grain of salt.  Not everyone will like the cruise for one reason or another.  Some people are bound and determined to just have a bad time and put that in their cruise review.    While booking at the last minute can get you some great deals, be careful with the Alaskan cruises.  Because they don't run all year long, they tend to fill up quickly.    Good luck and have fun!|`|EReDjcBPaa	For men? loss of freedom and money, no more bjs and no sex at all after the first kid is born|`|fukzl8oaaa	There will be all kinds of great prices this year.

Your birth certificate should be a "certified" copy from your state's record's office, meaning it should have the raised seal on it (not a photocopy).    And I believe that you need two (2) photos.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	You need 2 passport photos to apply for a passport.  You also need the driver's license and the birth certificate.

Many people, all different ages go for multitudes of styles around here, 50's (great look and looking more popular) and then there is the old traveler style - 'shall I wear jeans or a dress or a mini skirt with clashing colours? - oh sod it, I will Wear all of it altogether!' - this seems to be the main look I see around here!

rSq790ksaa	Go during March break.    In the summer the crowds are heavy, the lines are too long and it's way too hot. March will have medium sized crowds, nice weather and decent sized lines.

October, November and February are probably the least busy times to be there.    I'd go for spring break just for the better weather.    You'll still have tons of fun, just be prepared for long lines (probably about an hour and a half) at the big rides.|`|9RA6ugRbaa	WE WENT ON 4TH OF JULY IT WAS PACKED BUT IT WAS VERY COOL|`|5AI4xIB3aa	November-Decembet are great times to go.

Besides that, reasonable waiting times, its very good.|`|FQ4nhSiRaa	It is much hotter during the summer. It is probably more crowded in the summer though spring break is quite crowded also. If you go during the summer, the last week of August is ideal and the crowds are lighter than any other summer week, and that is considered "value" season for accomodations. I've been there both times and the main thing better about the spring it wasnt 95 degrees everyday. but the lines in the park were still long.

Your best bet is to take a 98 B-line bus that goes from Anderson to Airport Station,and then goes to Waterfront Station which is right outside where the cruiseships dock.  It would be 3.75 for the bus instead, and you get to save a lot of money.    Refer to http://www.translink.bc.ca and go to schedules and 98 B line, and then it will give you the times.

i7oHTo9haa	Palestine was considered the national homeland of Jewish people.  And we've considered it on THIS side of the Jordan River.  The other side of the Jordan is fine, no need for it to be ours. Maybe that's why they named it Trans-Jordan. Trans means across or to cross.    Jewish people are actually the original "Palestinians" The area was named Palestine by the Romans as an insult to Jewish people because it was new name version of Jewish arch enemy the Philistines. (They were Greek) The Palestinian region at that time was basically named Judah which did include parts of Jordan.  Romans didn't like that.  So under Roman rule they named it Palestine.    During Roman rule, the Arab's territory was out of Damascus.  The non-Jewish people present in the region ended up calling themselves Syrians.  So at that time, there were Jews and Syrians and Romans.    The reason the Palestinian name didn't stick to Jewish people is because it was an artificial name that the Romans gave us. We are all Israelites and modern day Israeli.  Jew is derived from Judah (tribe) and isn't entirely accurate to call us all that, but basically we don't mind.    Jordan could have very well kept the Palestine name but it would have been artificial for them to do that too.  It was just a region that the Romans gave the place because of Philistines and hatred for Jews and to re-name Judah region.    It's time to let the old era pass and consider everyone what modern nationalities they actually are.  Jewish people are Israeli and the Palestinians are Syrians who came from Syria to overthrow both Jordan and Israel. Syria wanted to re-establish their "Great Syrian Empire" and actually still wants Israel, Jordan and Lebanon.  Jordan has a very peaceful gov't these Palestine people aren't Jordanians.  The Palestinians were birthed by Syria to overthrow both Jordan and Israel so can't really call them Jordanians but just ongoing violent Syrians.|`|HC9uLzW7aa	Why are you wearing a turban? You don't know Punjab women don't wear a turban. pft...shows how much you know about culture.|`|UIJorsD7aa	Jordan is Palestine. Palestine is Jordan.   This is the royal decree and sentiments of two of the kings of Jordan.     "Palestine and Jordan are one..." said King Abdullah in 1948.     "The truth is that Jordan is Palestine and Palestine is Jordan," said King Hussein of Jordan, in 1981.     Let's closely examine the facts of history from the Arab perspective, rather than the Jewish one, regarding Jordan and Palestine.     "Palestine is Jordan and Jordan is Palestine; there is only one land, with one history and one and the same fate," Prince Hassan of the Jordanian National Assembly was quoted as saying on February 2, 1970.     Accordingly, Abdul Hamid Sharif, Prime Minister of Jordan declared, in 1980, "The Palestinians and Jordanians do not belong to different nationalities. They hold the same Jordanian passports, are Arabs and have the same Jordanian culture."     In other words, Jordan is Palestine. Arab Palestine. There is absolutely no difference between Jordan and Palestine, nor between Jordanians and Palestinians (all actually Arabs).     This fact is also confirmed by other Arabs, Jordanians and 'Palestinans' who were either rulers or scholars.     "There should be a kind of linkage because Jordanians and Palestinians are considered by the PLO as one people," according to Farouk Kaddoumi, then head of the PLO Political Department, who gave the statement to Newsweek on March 14, 1977. Distinguished Arab-American Princeton University historian Philip Hitti testified before the Anglo-American Committee,     "There is no such thing as 'Palestine' in history."   According to Arab-American columnist Joseph Farah,   "Palestine has never existed - before or since - as an autonomous entity. It was ruled alternately by Rome, by Islamic and Christian crusaders, by the Ottoman Empire, and briefly by the British after World War I. The British agreed to restore at least part of the land to the Jewish people as their homeland. There was no language known as Palestinian. There was no distinct Palestinian culture. There has never been a Palestine governed by the Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis, etc."   These authoritative, honest statements are by Arabs, Jordanians and Palestinians, and absolutely must be taken at their face value and word.   All right, so you're not quite into quotes. How about these tasteful tidbits of historical facts?     * Jews, not Arabs, have lived continuously in the ancient Biblical Promised Land of Israel, especially Judea and Samaria, for 3,700 years. This land was given as a gift by G-d to the Children of Israel (Hebrews, Israelites, Jews) and is so stated in all of the three monotheistic religions' holy books - Old Testament, New Testament and Quran. Faithful followers of Judaism, Christianity and Islam all believe in the same one G-d and therefore must believe the word of their G-d. G-d does not make and break his promises. There is a very valuable lesson to be learned by all his children and faithful followers.   * The current queen of Jordan is an Arab 'Palestinian'.     * Approximately half of Jordan's prime ministers since 1950 have been Arab 'Palestinians'.     * More than 2/3 of the Jordanian people are Arab 'Palestinians'.     * The majority of citizens residing in the capital of Amman are Arab 'Palestinians'.     * Arab 'Palestinians' constitute not less than one half of the members of the armed forces, according to the late King Hussein, as broadcast on Amman Radio February 3, 1973.     * The majority of other security forces are Arab 'Palestinians'.     * Jordan occupies 77% of the original Palestine Mandate (originally promised to the Jewish people). The population density of Jordan is less than 61 people per square mile leaving lots of room to absorb many more of their brethren and cousins.    Want to delve even deeper? Let's explore further. We all need to refresh our memory, as 'short-term syndrome' has taken over. Now for a little history lesson, for those who do not recall the reality of the past.   The British tried to placate the Arabs by giving them part of the land designated under the Palestine Mandate (originally allocated under the Balfour Declaration for the establishment of a Jewish homeland). Britain created an entirely new province by severing 77% of historic Palestine (and an additional 3% was also allocated to Syria), on the eastern bank of the Jordan River (some 35,000 square miles), and establishing the state of Transjordan.     Faisal, who had been King of Syria, was deposed by the French, so the British offered him the throne of Iraq, which he accepted. Faisal's brother Abdullah was installed as the new nation of Transjordan's ruler on April 1, 1921 (April Fool's Day), thereby completing the appeasement of Arab rulers.|`|bMJ0AYI1aa	when jordan was created, nobody called themselves a palestinian arab. the term palestine referred to the whole region, and there were arabs and jews there, but arabs had not identified with palestine and didn't call themselves palestinian.  that only started after 1967, and the reason is that it was the only way to keep fighting israel. jordan, egypt, syria, lebanon all had boundries, so they couldn't try to steal israel, and they lost in their attempts to destroy israel. so they invented another group that could whine and complain about israel.|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	Senior King Hussein did name it Kingdom of Palestine.

hSOYndoxaa	I ALWAYS tip the maids and it usually depends on how long I am staying. Usually a few dollars everyday. I leave it on the bed. Most maids get minimum wage and the few extra dollars you give is greatly appreciated and you also get top notch service from them when you tip.|`|2gRdi0xRaa	Just enough that they won't steal my stuff when they come in.

I didn't realize we should; I mean I can understand if a room was extremely messy or something; but when I'm paying 400 some dollars a night in a hotel room, I can't afford to tip the maid too.    If you were going to though, I think that sounds about right.|`|LrGhFAkkaa	It depends on where you go. There are various cultures for tipping around the world. A tip might be expected when you stay at a hotel in the USA but if you go to places like Norway, Japan etc. tipping is not really that common and the maid will not expect a tip.

Because theres certain nights that are better then other here as far as clubs go.... TAO is amazing!!!!!!!!!! It's in the venetian. It's a restaurant (really beautiful/fun/loud music) and its a club... the club is right above the restaurant, so thats why its loud music.... you walk upstairs to the club and its SO AWESOME! It's a very trendy/asian/zen look, alot of celebs go there! A club called Jet is great (in the mirage) if you love techno music, they play alot of bass and house music, Poetry is the number one hip-hop nightclub on the strip if thats ur thing (its in the Forum Shops of Caesars Palace) And if you love Ed Hardy, theres the Christian Audigier nightclub in T.I. which is pretty cool. RAIN in the Palms is AWESOME and theres also the Playboy Club in the Palms too (i havent been there but all my friends love it!)

1Vih78dZaa	This is a very complex topic. The "North-South Divide" in Italy has existed for a very long time. Many Italian governments have recognised the problem and tried to address it. Volumes have been written on the topic and it always gets discussed in any book on the problems of modern Italy.    In the most basic terms, you would be right to say that a large part of the problem is that the south of Italy has an economy based largely on agriculture while the north is a highly industrialised area. The amount of money generated by agrarian economies is always less than what's possible in an industrialised economy. This means there's simply less money coming into the south which means that even those on the top of the economic pile have relatively little to spend which means that there are fewer jobs.    (In the crudest terms: consider how much the family that controlled Fiat could spend on goods and services compared to how much even the wealthiest tomato farmer in Calabria can spend on the same.)    Economies based on agriculture are also seasonal by nature and the work is very often casual.     That might be sufficient for your purposes, but the reality is actually a LOT more complicated (as just about everything is in Italy!).    Some trace the problems back centuries to the fact that the Kingdoms in the southern part of the Italic peninsula were ruled by foreigners for centuries while the states in the north were controlled by local people. The suggestion is that, in the south, a culture developed in which people expected to be exploited and so they basically gave up on advancing themselves, while in the north, it was much easier to get ahead in a more entrepreneurial culture.    Other people explain the south of Italy's problems in terms of organised crime. It is undeniably true that while the Italian state has spent a lot of money on trying to improve the infrastructure of the south and bring work into the area, a lot of this money has been diverted into the pockets of criminals. The classic stories are of motorways that end in half-finished bridges because the money ran out. The reason the money ran out is because the construction was controlled by organised crime; they bid low to get the work, then stopped actually building as soon as they got their hands on the money. At this point, the construction firm basically disappears  all the workers fired, all the equipment shipped off to North Africa or somewhere and sold, the rented offices abandoned.    It's also a fact that the official statistics on unemployment in Italy are even less dependable than those numbers usually are. A huge part of the Italian economy is "in the black". One of the aspects of this unofficial economic activity which the government is never told about is all the people who work only for cash and so never pay taxes and are never counted as being employed. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that there are huge numbers of non-Italians working in this country illegally. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence that there are people in the south of the country who are officially unemployed or disabled, but are actually working for cash.    The general atmosphere of corruption in the south and the generally held view that the Italian state is something to be exploited contribute to this problem.    As for what you can do to help, it seems to me that since Italy is a modern European democracy, it's really up to the Italians to figure out what is wrong with the part of their country that has chronically under-performed and for them to decide what to do about it. As I have said, many Italian governments have tried to improve things in the South, but the problems are incredibly deep-rooted.    You and your classmates could eat Scillian oranges until you looked like one and bathe every night in Puglian olive oil, but it would not solve the problems of Southern Italy.|`|xqtKODvbaa	Southern Italy is not as technologically advanced as the northern parts, and therefore there's less jobs, thus less opportunities    many communities in southern Italy still live with the old world customs and small parcel farming, even though most places have adapted to using some modern technologies, most places depend mainly on tourism, which at times like now, get hit pretty hard. In northern Italy; Milan, Venezia, etc, more people live lifestyles close to that of people in metropolitan areas throughout the world.
iull1NWJaa	There will be summer sales in August. There are many cloth shops in Ag. Napa with alternative cloths (including indie). I think you should take a chance and visit Larnaca's market, it's not far from Ag. Napa.( Nicosia is also offered for cloth shopping)
88ebafa77258f20ad534b815e89fa7bdaa	Yo creo que despues de CanCun es el lugar de Mexico con los hoteles mas espectaculares, la playa es muy bonita, hay poca gente y tiene el atractivo que ademas de la playa, los bares y antros, hay pesca deportiva, puedes tomar una lancha y te llevan a pescar mar adentro. otro de los atractivos principales es que de diciembre a abril, llegan las ballenas a una de las bahias cercanas y hay paseos en bote para verlas.    El concepto es diferente a otras playas de Mexico donde todos los hoteles estan juntos alrededor de una zona comercial y de diversion a donde puedes salir, aca si hay tal zona en la punta de cabo san lucas, pero muchos hoteles estan muy alejados unos de otros a lo largo de la carretera de San Lucas a San Jose del Cabo y estan desarrollados para tener todo dentro del hotel y que no tengas necesidad de salir.    Lo que no me gusto es que no hay Mexicanos, practicamente te sientes extranjero porque el 90% de turistas son extranjeros (al menos en el hotel donde fui, y en la temporada que fui). Otra desventaja es que en ciertas temporadas del a?o el mar esta muy frio, solo algunos meses tienen corrientes de agua caliente a diferencia del Caribe o del Pacifico mas abajo donde todo el a?o tienes aguas tibias.    En resumen, vale mucho la pena.|`|ca8ed53ee09fe6b98e77a544c1ec4e0caa	yo tampoco conosco... ahy me cuentas... sobres bye|`|845cf5bb429bb898a8ecff3aa5ea60cfaa	Los Cabos es un lugar fabuloso... tengo dos a?os viviendo aqui y no tengo ganas de moverme a otro lado. Te recomiendo que visites esta pagina http://www.bcs.gob.mx/ viene una muy buena guia turistica que desarrolla el gobierno del estado y creeme lo que ves ahi no tiene comparacion con lo que vas a ver llegando.  Lo que te recomiendo es que si vienes te vengas con tiempo y rentes una auto para que puedas visitar La Paz que queda a solo dos horas y media, Buena Vista, Los Barriles y  Todos Santos. Hay playas muy bonitas que no tienen un hotel por lo que sera necesario que tengas un auto para llegar hacia ellas. El paisaje en carretera es fabuloso asi que lo vas a poder disfrutar mucho. Hay una gran cantidad de actividades que puedes hacer y restaurantes de los mejores. Solo ten cuidado e informate bien antes de venir porque hay lugares en que si abusan en los precios ..
HFlytHlRaa	Actually, Uggs and boots similar to Uggs are pretty popular in the city. You'd be hardup to find a girl who isn't wearing a pair or have one in her closet.     That said, it's cold and it's been raining/snowing for ages. Boots are probably your best bet. Something warm and something that won't be damaged by water as there's puddles and slush everywhere.|`|HGi9XjZ9aa	New York City is closed in February. Pick another month.|`|rSq790ksaa	Uggs will get ruined if it's snows and it's very possible that it will being that we are getting a lot of snow this winter.

However, do pack a pair of boots in case it snow in the Big Apple.    Good luck|`|rYg3SOFpaa	People are very anyi-ugg these days but I suggest uggs, they keep ur feet really warm and they're super comfortable.
ypyqWxlgaa	As far as public schools go, judging by what they pay their substitute teachers, I'd say Warren Con is up there.  I believe Chippewa Valley might be up there, but I'm not positive on that one.  FYI - Royal Oak's pay is lower and they are closing what schools they can, probably because the district is deeply sunk into debt.  Parochial schools pay a lot less and have very few benefits, of course.  I don't know about private schools like Cranbrook.    HOWEVER, I wish you luck if you're looking at applying to teach anywhere in the area.  On average, there are about 400 qualified applicants for every opening, and a majority go to someone who is already established in the district (a sub, or by nepotism).  Also, not many schools are hiring due to budget constraints - they're eliminating what they can (not filling positions of retirees, and offering buy-outs).|`|xWGJHMkuaa	Your going to want to look into the more affluent districts: West Bloomfield, Birmingham, and the Grosse Pointes|`|MBFeHS22aa	The MEA will not tell you but I will tell you that the pay scale dose not vary that much from district to district.|`|fIK9LBEuaa	I can't say for sure, since I don't know the salaries of teachers in all of Michigan.

Fz5TLaLDaa	Deer Creek is an RV golf resort so I don't think there are any conventional "vacation rentals" available on there other than renting direct from the park management.     They do have park homes to rent which start from $66 + tax a night.    I assume you already have the website but I have listed it below.    The exchange rate is so awful at the moment that if you are from the UK you are better off renting  a villa from a UK owner and paying in Sterling.     Your $66 park home would be the equivalent of 70 a night or nearly 490 a week. If you were to rent a golf course villa anywhere in Davenport for a month you should be able to do a deal with the owner for considerably less than that.    Check out holiday-rentals - you can select golf villas and then search by location / availability and price.

Sporting :  Maybe see about a hockey game at American Airlines Arena.    Hotel: I suggest Comfort inn for reasonable price.  Hilton for the best experience. My parents also stayed downtown once.  very expensive I think.     Art :  Check out the Mayerson and related downtown theatres etc.  There is an art exibit usually in Fort Worth (Kimbell).  College town is close to Lower greenville and there are some nice pubs / piercing places in Deep Ellum.  Take a Taxi or you may get mugged on your way to the car.

The Paddle Boats at the Tidal Basin, it's only 8 bucks for a 2 passenger boat and you get really cool views of the monuments.   2. Screen on the Green which project movies onto a huge screen on the National Mall and it's totally free. It happens during the summer on Monday nights.   3. The Commandants Own, since you are in DC I would really check this out. This is pretty much the only place you can see this happen. It goes on I think from May - August on Friday Evenings at the Marine Barracks and Tuesday evenings at the the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial.  4. DC Kite Festival, it's pretty cool to see a bunch of kites flying above the Mall. Always happens in March.   5. Folk Life Festival, which happens in the summer on the National Mall. It's pretty cool if you're into crafts and things.     I know I mentioned stuff that happens in the summer, but DC is just so cold!|`|CKRtwea6aa	Crime and Punishment museum is now open - I think its on 7th St. Unusual stuff in there.
urHPuzMsaa	Not good for you. You have to be 21 for many jobs here that pay any good money. But there are not that many job openings right now. The economy is so bad they are laying off people at all businesses. For every job opening there are 100 applicants. They want experienced people and people who have lived here for awhile. They do not want to take chances on new people who will tire of Vegas and leave within a year like most people do.    Home costs average $150,000 to buy a decent house or $800 a month to rent. But you have to have about $2500 to rent a house for the first month.|`|mAV5MJQnaa	It depends on how much you have in your budget if you can afford to pay for the hotel rooms, the foods, the gambling. I would look into a Las Vegas guide.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	1) How much home cost? -- Right now, extremely cheap. I have a friend who is a cop and he just bought a big house with a pool.     2) If it is easy to find work and how you earn per month. No. the Jib market is dead. To get a good job now you need to know someone, or have a very high degree. At 17 that wont be likely.    3) As is the life there in Las Vegas?  Its great for some people, but at 17 you will be limited to take advantage of much of what the city has to offer.
FBR7cMshaa	hey there,  you'll love it there KL its lovely and with lots to do.  i went a few years back and spent three weeks in malaysia and singapore and only spent a thousand u.s dollars.  the cost of living there is really cheap,i couldn't tell you how much a meal is cos it depends where you eat. but put this in perspective we stayed in a 4 star hotel next to the petronas towers for 30 euros a night. a single meal should not be more than 5 euros. we were on a budget cos we were back packing so mcdonalds was frequently visited and its nice for a change. you get a large big mac meal and an extra burger for 3 euros!!! be warned alcohol is fairly expensive in comparison to food because malaysia is a muslim country there a big tax on alcohol    here are some tips for places to visit:    obviously petronas towers,the sky bridge,get there early in the morning.plus theres a shopping centre with designer outlets and a science centre with entertainment for adults and kids.just by chance they were making a movie while we were there.you'll find yourself sitting under them at night gazing at them lit up,spectacular!    menara tower,spectacular views of the city.you can get an audio tour which is helpful.its built on a hill so the top is level with the top of the petronas towers and you cant get to the top of them so its the best view in the city.    batu caves.these are hindu temples about twenty mins drive outside the city,taxi ride 2 or 3 quid and haggle with them!! spectacular place,once you climb the many steps the sights are lovely its advisable to get the audio tour here also....oh and watch out for the monkeys they're real friendly!    K.L zoo.again its another way to spend a day with a huge zoo and all the animals you can think off.    there was also a water park but cant think of the name,enjoyable for the kids and lets face it the adults too.    hope this advise was helpful and enjoy K.L....im actually jealous here now.|`|nUgNAo7haa	The name of the waterpark Jimmy has forgotten is Sunway lagoon.

See below for an example.  http://411newyork.org/forum/index.php?sh...|`|QduQ77tqaa	I'm gonna tell you something you don't want to hear...  You can't check into a hotel under 18. No matter what. Some hotels have a minimum age requirement of 21. Especially in big cities. And honestly, if its a large group of teens/college-aged kids, you run the risk of being turned away regardless, since the hotel wants to avoid you making noise and making other guest complain [and ask for a refund$, its all about the money].     If your parents paid and you were **18**, you'd still need to show ID along with the credit card. You won't be checked in unless your ID matches the credit card's.. its too much of a liability for them. BUT...they [your parents] can fax over a credit card authorization though, to allow it. Being that the auth. would only be approved for room & tax, you would still have to put up your own card for any possible damages, movies, room service, etc. So you'd still have to have your own credit card if you were to hold off and make the trip at 18. Few places still accept cash [or cash deposits] these days. Its something that attracts the seedy crowd, so they're straying from it now.   But of course, you could stay in a lesser known, motel-like place and probably get no problems at all. If you're not an experience NYC traveler, I DO NOT recommend this.

JAJAJA Todo depende colega de lo que quieres a cambio porque en Portugal igual es ms barato ciertas cosas pero el combustible es ms caro que en Espa?a y los hoteles son parecidos en precio pero recibes muy poco a cambio porque no es un pas "tan" interesante si tu objetivo es pasear... Praga (Chequia) es cierto lo que dice la chica... es barato y encima bonito, distinto y interesante... pero solo te durar dos o tres dias la diversin porque es lo nico que tiene interesante ese pas aparte que es una ciudad relativamente peque?a... Tursticamente hablando yo escogera Espa?a sin dudas pues es el ms variado y donde mejor la pasars relacin calidad precio... Si tienes algo de dinerillo pues tampoco hay que ser rico para ir Francia, Holanda e Italia son buenas opciones y preciosos pases para ir de turista pero hay que ir con dinero para disfrutarlos y no te arrepentirs de lo gastado porque son fabulosos los tres... el resto puede ser barato pero no est "tan" dirigido al turismo o incluso tienen problemas de seguridad en algunos casos... Y recuerda que no por gusto Espa?a es el 2do receptor de turistas del mundo y primer destino turstico escogido por lo europeos con ms de 66 millones de turistas al a?o escogiendolo como su destino favorito por encima de USA y por debajo de Francia que es un pas emblemtico pero caro para comer bien, combustibles y moverte pues para alojarte es sorprendentemente variado y muy barato... La decisin es tuya yo te recomiendo personalmente Espa?a si es ms de una semana o Praga si vas solo un par de dias de paseo y no la conoces... si tienes algo de dinerillo ya te expliqu otras buenas opciones... un saludo (de Gran Breta?a y los Nrdicos olvidate que son carsimos)|`|i9PfjsoHaa	Dicen que Repblica Checa y Dinamarca, ya que son dos paises que no usan euros.

Est ubicada a 40 m de altitud, en el extremo meridional de la pennsula de Baja California, ba?ada por las aguas del ocano Pacfico.     Tiene un clima clido. En esta parte se forman fuertes corrientes martimas, que causan la erosin de las rocas costeras y la formacin de mogotes, arcos rocosos y farallones que constituyen el principal atractivo natural y turstico de la regin, tales como El Arco o Finisterra.     Existe, adems, un refugio marino para diversas especies de fauna, cercano a un profundo ca?n submarino que se abre frente a la costa.     Cuenta con un puerto de cabotaje dedicado fundamentalmente a la pesca. Esta actividad ha impulsado el desarrollo industrial a partir de la creacin de una empacadora de mariscos.     Las extensas playas y la belleza de su litoral la han convertido en un lugar turstico por excelencia. Los pescadores consideran a Los Cabos como la capital internacional de la pesca del Marln Azul, por la captura de ejemplares nicos; cuenta con campos de golf cerca del mar y se pueden contemplar las migraciones de las ballenas, que pasan en sus viajes a pocos metros de la orilla.     La ciudad fue fundada en 1981. Poblacin (2000), 37.984 habitantes.    A pocos kilmetros est el Aeropuerto Internacional Los Cabos y toda la costa tiene gran atractivo turstico    Saludos

No se si en esos hay cuartos para dos, pero en La Haya (Den Haag/The Hague) acabo de hacer una reserva precisamente para dos personas en un cuarto doble que tiene propio ba?o y ducha.|`|7cfd0072ce3ddd79a65a818ebb13f58faa	EL mejor hostel de amsterdam es el flying pig.    Hay dos unos que est a las afueras y otro que est en el centro. En la parte de abajo tiene un bar en el que se reune gente.    Espero que puedas encontrar sitio.    Sino en la web  http://www.hostelworld.com/ puedes ver valoraciones, precios, etc. de los hostales. Adems puedes mirar los tipos de habitacin que hay y si hay plazas para los das que quieres ir. La he mirado y sale el hostal que mencionas. No est mal pero los hay mejores.    En los hostels de Europa suele haber habitaciones de 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. De dos es difcil encontrar pero en la web que te digo seguro que encuentras algo. Adems suelen tener cocina para no tener que comer todo el da fuera y as no se gasta tanto.    Un saludo

i9PfjsoHaa	Hola. Lo que te dicen es verdad. La bicicleta es el mejor medio para andar por la ciudad. Slo debes ser cuidadosa pues hay mucho trfico en la ciudad, adems de tranvas, muchos peatones (sobre todo turistas) y claro, muchos ciclistas ms.    Puedes comprar una bici o rentarla. Cerca de las diversas estaciones de tren hay lugares para dejar la bicleta sin pagar y tambin "estacionamientos" con seguridad que no son nada caros.    Los patines sinceramente no te los recomiendo. Efectivamente todas las calles de las ciudad (como la mayoria de las ciuades holandesas) estn hechas de adoquines y bloques peque?itos. Yo no s que tan buena eres con los patines, seguramente mucho! Pero de cualquier modo creo que A'dam no es una ciudad ideal para ello pues los adoquines y lo antiguo de las calles da como resultado muchas irregularidades en el piso.    Sobre hostels, yo te recomendaria los stayokay.com. Hay tres hostels en A'dam. Yo me qued hace unos a?os en le que est en el Vondelpark y estuvo muy bien.    Saludos y que disfrutes mucho!|`|j8wZwC5raa	Agnciate una bici, por unos 10 florines puedes conseguirla por los alrededores del barrio rojo, es lo ms fcil de negociar porque van y vienen, desaparecen y vuelven a aparecer. ?Curiosa gente?|`|qoP6hV3naa	Hay muchas bicisendas...todas estn muy prolijas y sin deformaciones.  Creo que si ya ests acostumbrada en andar por la ciudad, Amsterdam se te va hacer muy fcil. Eso s, cuidado con el gran trafico!!!  Si, las ciudades de Blgica (por lo menos Gante y Brujas) tiene mucho adoquinos, pero amsterdam es mucho ms asfalto  Hay muchos hostels por 20 euros cerca en la zona roja, you fui al shelter city, pero no lo recomiendo  Saludos|`|a70E5RNhaa	No ssabra decirte con exactitud. He estado documentandome, viendo documentales sobre Amsterdam y tal (porque este verano tambin yo ir de vacaciones all), pero realmente el suelo.....mmm creo que adoquines si que tiene pero no parecen muy en relieve no s, creok que para patinar estara bien, y si no lo que dice esta chica, te compras una bici.
3c402abe5ff02363bb109bc4df28adefaa	 una zona strategica, a met tra centro e periferia.  molto ben collegata (passano 3 linee della metro), non  distante dalla Gare de Lyon. Ci sono molte attivit commerciali, e i prezzi non sono eccessivi dato che  una zona prettamente residenziale e non turistica. Il nome deriva dal fatto che in quella piazza nasce la RN 7 (sarebbe l'equivalente di una nostra statale) che porta in Italia, precisamente a Ventimiglia. Se devi fare una vacanza te lo consiglio per gli alberghi. Sono molto pi economici rispetto ad altre zone, e con 10 minuti di metro raggiungi tutti i luoghi turistici principali.|`|IPdsK0kvaa	Per noi parigiani questa zona e chiamata "Chinatown"...La bella Italia e lontana...  Ciao|`|xN4HDB45aa	La piazza, che si trova nel 13 arrondissement,   senza fascino, molto grande, trafficatissima e caotica; ma nei dintorni ci sono zone carine. Diciamo che segna un po' il confine tra una zona centrale e un'altra gi piuttosto periferica. In effetti, come ti hanno gi detto, si trova nella parte Sud-Est della citt, in direzione dell'Italia, e probabilmente deve a questo il suo nome.    In realt Parigi rende molti omaggi al nostro Paese: in pieno centro, vicino all'Opr, c' il Boulevard des Italiens e poi ci sono una miriade di strade con nomi "italiani", da rue de Milan a rue de Rome, passando perfino da rue de Vintimille. Devo dire che noi non restituiamo la cortesia: non mi viene in mente una sola citt italiana in cui ci sia una via o una piazza dedicata a Parigi...

Io, place d'Italie, la odio abbastanza,  brutta e incasinata. Certo che risalendo verso il centro, si migliora, e gi ai Gobelins, insomma, si sta meglio.    La place si chiama cos per le ragioni date sopra, mentre il nome del  boulevard  dovuto alla presenza del teatro des Italiens (oggi Opra Comique) che aveva molto successo.    A Roma,non c' una chiesa di S. Luigi ai Francesi? A Milano, pi che altro, ci sono molte vie intitolate a personalit francesi, come via Stendhal, Valry, o largo Albert Camus!

3b23c4eeb2e7426cb75608b54fe5a140aa	No, no lo hagas, ser un error, se paciente, y reglaselo a alguien que lo necesite y lo sepa apreciar    atrevete a romper el jarrn!    Permteme ayudarte:     Yo creo que no vale la pena, martirizar el alma de esa manera, ahora bien respondiendo completamente a tu pregunta, tengo la solucin perfecta:    Es dura y dificil, pero funciona, te lo digo por experiencia propia, Mira:    Atrevete a romper el jarrn: Es mucho ms dificil olvidar que aprender a amar, pero sigue este consejo que ojal te sea til:    EL PROBLEMA   Cierto da en un monasterio budista tibetano, encontraron muerto a uno de sus guardianes y fue preciso encontrar un sustituto. El Gran Maestro convoc a todos los discpulos para determinar quien sera el nuevo centinela. El Maestro, con mucha tranquilidad y calma, coloc una magnfica mesita en el centro de la enorme sala en la que estaban reunidos y encima de sta, coloc un jarrn de porcelana muy raro y en l, una rosa amarilla de extraordinaria belleza y dijo:   - "Aqu est el problema". Asumir el puesto el primer monje que lo resuelva.     Todos quedaron asombrados mirando aquella escena: un jarrn de gran valor y belleza, con una maravillosa flor en el centro. ?Qu representara?, ?Qu hacer?, ?Cul es el enigma? En ese instante, uno de los discpulos sac una espada, mir al Gran Maestro, y a todos sus compa?eros, se dirigi al centro de la sala y ??ZAZ!! Destruy todo de un slo golpe.   Tan pronto el discpulo retorn a su lugar, el Gran Maestro dijo: -    "Usted ser el nuevo Guardin del Monasterio".     Moraleja de la Historia:   No importa cul sea el problema. Ni que sea algo lindsimo.   Si es un problema, precisa ser eliminado, un problema es un problema, no importa que se trate de una mujer sensacional, o de un hombre maravilloso o de un gran amor que se acab, por ms hermoso que sea o haya sido, si no existiera ms sentido en tu vida, tiene que ser suprimida.     Muchas personas cargan la vida entera el peso de cosas que fueron importantes en el pasado y que hoy solamente ocupan un espacio intil en sus corazones y mentes, espacio que es indispensable para recrear la vida.     Limpia tu vida, comienza por las gavetas, armarios, hasta llegar a las personas del pasado que no tienen ms sentido y que estn ocupando espacio en tu corazn.     El pasado sirve como leccin, como experiencia, como referencia, sirve para ser recordado, no para ser revivido. Usa las experiencias del pasado en el presente, para construir tu futuro. ?Necesariamente en ese orden!     "Exgete mucho a ti mismo y espera poco de los dems. As te ahorrars disgustos".     No le digas a tu Dios que tienes un gran problema, dile a tu problema que tienes un gran Dios.    Aunque no todos nos atrevemos a dar ese paso, por el temor y la resistencia al cambio, temor a no encontrar a alguien igual, porque si fue maravilloso, lo trataremos de repetir con otra, y esto es un gran error, cada amor es diferente, y por lo tanto irrepetible.    Debemos no caer en el error, de que si ya decidimos romper el jarrn,. es totalmente inutil tratar de recuperarlo, ya que: "el amor como toda cermica, al reconstruirlo, se le vern las cicatrices y jams quedar igual"     Espero que te haya sido de utilidad. Cada amor es diferente, y por lo tanto irrepetible. A veces queremos que las parejas sean iguales a las anteriores. Grave error.     ?)  ?.??.?*) ?.?*)?  (?.? (?.?` ...  ______(`*?.?

Amsterdam es muy peque?o, todo se hace a pie, y vas a ver todo de toda forma, porque todo esta central.     Pienso que hay que ir a la casa de Anna Franka, y los museos (Rijksmuseum y Museum Van Gogh) son muy cerca.     Como estaras por mucho tiempo, intenta tambien de ver algo fuera de la ciudad, como unos pueblos romanticos como Monnikendam o "Broek in Waterland", unos 30 minutos al norte de Amsterdam, al lago. Y, por que no, a la provincia Frislandia al norte. Holanda es tan peque?o que puedes hacer eso en un tarde.

i9PfjsoHaa	Hola, no dices de donde eres, yo slo s que si eres de Mexico no necesitas ningn visado en Europa, pero claro s en EUA
aT1wujIKaa	Estimado as_esor    Lo que te han dicho es cierto. Pero hay mas.    La forma de los enchufes es diferente. All las conexiones son redondas y no planas como en America, as que no solo no te coincidir la corriente, sino que ser imposible conectar los cables.    Para tal fin se venden conectores y adaptadores especiales. Puedes buscar en www.amazon.com bajo la frase "travel adapter" y ver unos cuantos modelos.    Pero, atencin. Hay dos tipos de adaptadores: Aquellos que slo sirven como enchufes, es decir que te permiten conectar un enchufe europeo en uno americano y viceversa pero que NO alteran el voltaje, en cuyo caso NO TE SIRVEN porque da?aran tus aparatos.    Y el otro tipo de adaptadores son los que convierten el voltaje de 220 a 110, y esos son los que te sirven y los que debes pedir.    Te anexo dos productos, solo como ejemplos para que veas de lo que estoy hablando:    http://www.amazon.com/Samsonite-Converte...    http://www.amazon.com/Recoton-ADF50-Fore...    Yo vivo en Venezuela y compr aqu mismo uno parecido al primero pero de otra marca. En Mxico debe haberlos disponibles, si no los consigues los puedes pedir por internet.    Tomate tu tiempo para ver modelos y comparar precios. Estos aparatos tienden a calentarse con facilidad y algunos a quemarse, as que es bueno que compres un protector de voltaje para proteger tus dispositivos.    Saludos y buen viaje, no te olvides de elegir la mejor respuesta.|`|6803d03c9a1e329e4e11d4f9a23f4c4faa	Si los puedes llevar pero debers comprar un adaptador. En cualquier tienda los encuentras. Por ejempo yo compre uno para el cel en el corte ingls.|`|emBq1b0naa	Asi es, all son de 220v, pero puedes llevarte un convertidor de voltaje de 220v a 110v, si vives en el D.F. lo puedes conseguir facilmente en republica del Salvador, comunmente se llaman 'Elevadores de voltaje' ( Y sus salidas son de 110 y 220v)|`|i9PfjsoHaa	Lo que te contesta Alvaro es la mera neta, yo slo le agregara que, en realidad, no es tan difcil como parece, slo acrcate a una tienda de artculos elctricos (y electrnicos) y ah te sabrn asesorar.    Buen viaje paisano!

845cf5bb429bb898a8ecff3aa5ea60cfaa	es hermosos pero ha llegado tanta gente a vivir de todos lados que esto se esta convirtiendo en un caos... no tenemos vias para tanta gente ni vivienda y el trafico cada vez esta mas pesado. Es caro para vivir pero tambien puedes encontrar trabajo facilmente, no te recomiendo buscar en internet trabajo, aqui el mercado laboral no se maneja como en otros lados en internet o en el periodico, todo es por recomendaciones o los puestos menores se anuncian en el radio.|`|09e84fb7b20ac71713ee0b3bfdb4158daa	No es por desilucionarte pero yo fui el 13 de Marzo igual para quedarme y para buscar trabajo y la verdad la verdad, me regrese a los 8 dias, no me gusto, la verdad si tienes dinero y te vas a la vida buena (es decir que tengas carro que es lo primordial) bien por ti, pero las rentas son bastante caras dentro de la zona "habitable" van arriba de 3,000 4,000 sin exagerar y si no tienes carro no te sirve de nada vivir alla, ya que los pasajes son carisimos y las distancias son muy lejos, los trabajos son bien pagados pero lo mismo que ganas lo usas para poder vivir ahi y pagar tus gastos, yo la verdad no te lo recomiendo pero si logras conseguir un trabajo antes de irte quizas tengas suerte, checa aqui www.occ.com.mx y busca si hay algo disponible en Los Cabos|`|ee77c48144ef3dabf1a3b2c800334cfdaa	Imaginate que es una "Tijuanita"...
ThUEi8pqaa	Yo dira que fueras primero a Tegucigalpa, luego a Copn, luego a San Pedro Sula, luego a La Ceiba y deja lo mejor para el final Roatn.|`|zSLkmjiJaa	Puedes llegar en un vuelo comercial a Tegucigalpa pero es mejor San Pedro Sula ya que la pista es mas larga que la de Tegucigalpa las empresas de buses mejores son: (Saenz, Viana o Hedman y Alas) para tu estadia en los hoteles te recomiendo que hagas las reservaciones On-Line (con tiempo) ya que los hoteles pasan llenos en esta epoca , luego la empresa Hedman y Alas tambien tiene buses que salen a Copan Ruinas y hacia Ceiba, pero tu mejor tour seria asi:  SPS-Copan-Ceiba-Roatan luego para tu regreso puedes pasar por Tegucigalpa pero lo unico bonito de la capital son los lugares de comida en la noche y el clima. San Pedro Sula esta al nivel del mar asi que es caliente al igual que Ceiba y Roatan  Si necesitas mas ayuda respecto a los hoteles dejame saber y te puedo recomendar los mejores. Suerte.  Te mando este link para mejor orientacion: http://honduras.com/|`|q2QapCydaa	Tienes que llegar a Tegucigalpa y hacer de esa ciudad tu p?unto de partida. Ahora ir a Copn te resulta muy fcil, pero mucho entrar por Guatemala por el Oriente. A Roatan tienes que tomar un vuelo comercial para llegar hasta ahi a las islas de la bahia.  Luego regresar a Tegucigalpa y regresar a tu pais.|`|6RloTkh0aa	No se de donde eres pero en el DF hay una ag de viages especializada en Centroamerica y tienen buenos presion, tu les dices las cds a visitar y te arman el tour, y si tienes dudas ellos te orientan. Los costos son economicos, te dan tu maletin de viaje e incluyen traslados al apto-hotel-apto te doy el correo de una de las chicas que trabajan ahi, solicita inf o el tel por este medio (ale_soto20@hotmail.com) ojala te sea util... SUERTE!!!|`|RBbVlrUVaa	Primero al llegar a Tegucigalpa te recomiendo conocer todos los pueblos coloniales cercanos : Santa Luca, Valle De Angeles , Ojojona todos estn a menos de 40 minutos en carro... el transporte por bus a estos lugares es rural...  En Tegucigalpa puedes ir al parque Naciones Unidas es muy bonito con una excelente vista desde el Picacho de Tegucigalpa. Luego puedes tomar un Bus Para San Pedro Sula para conocer el Museo de antropologa e Historia que est muy cerca del centro de la ciudad.    De all puedes ir a Copn e ir al pueblo de Copn Ruinas que es muy hermosos y visitar las Ruinas mayas.    La Ceiba es excelente por que la gente es muy fiestera....    Pero sin lugar a dudas el mejor lugar para vacacionar es Roatn en Islas de La Baha puedes caminar a las tres de la ma?ana sin ningn problema..... Te recomiendo la Zona de West End y Half Moon Bay ..... trata de viajar por lancha es ms barato y rpido , aunque de Roatn a cualquier lugar de las Islas debes alquilar un taxi en el aeropuerto Juan Manuel Glvez      saludes|`|Tjt8AbaLaa	POR SUPUESTO QUE NO, ES UNA LOCURA, DE DONDE SACASTE ESO ??|`|V85PPQQLaa	De todos los lugares que comentas el ms interesante sin duda es Copn, ah deberas pasar ms tiempo para ver conocer realmente el lugar. Luego la zona de SPS y La Ceiba es una zona bonita donde se pueden hacer muchas cosas. Roatn es pura playa Caribe y pura fiesta, si lo que buscas es eso, lo pasars genial.  Tegus ya no tiene tanto atractivo. Es una ciudad fea y sin mucho que ver por lo que no te recomiendo estar mucho tiempo all.|`|qnYbbFTOaa	debes contactar con una buena agencia de viajes, ello te darn todos los detalles para que disfrutes al mximo tu viaje.|`|930fe73b33732f29f1d90a326d6ddf17aa	Lo mejor para conocer en Honduras (segn mi opinin) es Copn y las Islas de la Baha. Copn por ser un importante vestigio arqueolgico maya, y las islas (Roatn, Utila y Guanaja) por tener hermossimas playas y una gigante reserva de arrecifes de coral. Tegucigalpa y San Pedro Zula los puedes visitar por unos pocos das, aunque no hay mucho que resaltar de estas ciudades. Lo ms prctico para viajar de ciudad en ciudad es utilizar las aerolneas nacionales que utilizan peque?os aviones y los tiquetes son muy baratos. Lo mejor sera empezar en Tegucigalpa, tomar un avin Tegucigalpa-San Pedro, de San Pedro tomar autobs para ir a Copn, luego San Pedro-La Ceiba en avin, y finalmente La Ceiba-Roatn. Las islas son un lugar excelente para bucear en el da y pasar de fiesta en  las noches en la playa. Las escuelas de buceo abundan en Roatn y Utila, as como muy buenos resorts.
845cf5bb429bb898a8ecff3aa5ea60cfaa	Esta centrico, no es un hotel, es precisamente eso una suite, osea un mini depa. Creo que si vienes a trabajar vas a estar  bastante comodo.

Tienes la mega, el waldos, minisuper Ley, los cines y la comida rapida cerca y de hecho, el hotel queda sobre una plazita que esta bastante mona.
845cf5bb429bb898a8ecff3aa5ea60cfaa	Aqui es bastante dificil encontrar departamento, pero puedes acomodarte por mientras en alguna suite amueblada.  Busca las opciones en esta pagina:  http://www.loscabosguide.com/hotels/  Cuando llegues puedes buscar en cualquier tienda un ofercabos, que es una publicacion de anuncios clasificados, o darte una vuelta por el centro o las colonias, la gente acostumbra no anunciar los departamentos en renta y simplemente poner en ellos un letrero de se renta con un telefono.|`|09e84fb7b20ac71713ee0b3bfdb4158daa	es mejor que busques en el periodico local aqui no creo que encuentres mucha informacion|`|94c8596d5ff42fb4bc159b94515e33c3aa	est un poco dificil encontrar casas de renta, pero entra aqui, a ver si te sirve algo: www.cabomarket.com

Anda al mercado de las flores, al lado de la Torre de Montelbaan, ah puedes comprar souvenirs baratos.      Fuera de la ciudad los molinos (son pocos pero hermosos), o DELFT, venden cermicas.    Vale la pena visitar Amsterdam.

xi9YtImfaa	Don't visit those cities, visit San Antonio.|`|yeu09pfOaa	dallas|`|TYGgRjqDaa	They both have plenty of stuff to do.  Houston is tons more humid.|`|7VuKSI0uaa	I lived in Houston from 2001 -2005 and Dallas from 2005 - present.<br>  <br>  Dallas is much more regulated which I think makes it cleaner and safer.  For instance panhandling is not allowed (though you see a few now and then), no one is selling carpets in the middle of the road, porn shops are not next to day cares, etc.<br>  <br>  But as others have mentioned neither Dallas nor Houston would be my first choice of Texas cities.  San Antonio would have a better atmosphere/culture.  I have spent a lot of time in San Antonio also as both of my parents are from there and most of my relatives are still there.  Visit several times a year.|`|ke0dsgkkaa	Being from Texas, it would probably be Houston.

Houston is more accustomed to tourism, and there are more entertaining places to go, though I'm not very good at making a list.|`|TCctLAPCaa	Dallas! I live in Dallas and there are so many cool places to go.

Not all of Canada.<br>  <br>  If you go hiking here in Western Canada in the Rockies, Monoshees, Kootenays, or Coastal mountains, you may want to bring some bear mace.  If you buy proper bear mace it'll stop a charging bull grizzly from 5 meters away.|`|4INE794zaa	I live in the country, in Northern Ontario, where black bears run rampant. I hike every other day along a no longer used railway, and only ever bring my dogs along, no weapons. Once the bear gets a whiff, or sight of the dogs, they take off. Now if my dogs were female, and not spayed, then I might have an issue.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Such actions (carrying the 44) are illegal unless you are an on duty law enforcement officer BUT stupid things like this could happen so I'd never say it never does.|`|l4pVsxoraa	Contrary to previous answers carrying a handgun while in the bush is not necessarily illegal.  It also makes more sense to have a heavy calibre handgun than a rifle as defence against bear attack as it would take longer to get the rifle off your shoulder, aim it and fire than it would to bring a handgun into action (assuming you know how to use it).<br>  <br>  First of all the carrier must have a proper firearms licence and the handgun needs to be properly registered.  In order to legally carry it in the bush you would need to have an "authorization to carry" permit.  Many outfitters and wilderness guides have these permits for exactly the reason you've asked.|`|f9No4eRBaa	As you already know from the answers, it is illegal to carry a handgun in Canada for this purpose unless you have a special permit (I won't get into that, it's too complicated unless you are a prospector or hunting guide).<br>  I suggest if you have a PAL (Possession and Acquisition Certificate) in other words a gun license to carry a shotgun loaded with slugs and/or SSG shot.<br>  You have to remember not to have it loaded in your vehicle, transport it in your vehicle out of sight, store the gun with a trigger lock and out of sight. Carry it using all safety procedures.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	That would be illegal.|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	ILLEGAL|`|Twzg9s0caa	A .44 magnum will not stop a grizzly.<br>  You'll just annoy him.|`|azypqsphaa	no, it's pretty hard to get a permit for a handgun..|`|7QERhhRJaa	No you can't.

1o3OqSioaa	Check out www.greyhound.com or call greyhound at 1-800-231-2222. They go all over the country, and are inexpensive compared to flying in most cases. It's a great way to see the country and meet interesting people along the way. The only drawback is you have to transfer your luggage from one bus to another, if you are transferred. There are snack foods at most stations,  and a bathroom on the buses. Take your ipod, or a good book to read, or just enjoy the view and leave the driving to greyhound. Who knows, you might make a new friend along the way, as an added bonus.

xiB1BPwsaa	You don't say where you are from.<br>  <br>  To get a work VISA you need to be sponsored by an employer. No employer is going to sponsor a 17 year old with a diploma in art and design.<br>  <br>  The other way is through the green card lottery. Unlike most countries, the US has an immigration program to promote diversity and does not contain education, familial or other restrictions. However, it's set up to promote diversity, if you are from the UK you are SOL. Citizens of the UK cannot participate since there are already too many Brits working in the US.|`|QaEeITduaa	There are visa categories so check the US Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (US-BCIS) website to learn what the different immigration visa categories might be... One category you might be interested in considering is the student visa category; however, you will need admission to a university in the USA plus a financial sponsor to provide for your living expenses plus tuition/fees/books.
yKQKzKwMaa	That's terrible! I have never heard of Motion Eaze... however I HAVE used non-drowsy Dramamine with good results. Bonine is another great remedy that works on your stomach instead of your inner ear (like Dramamine does), but I wouldn't recommend taking both at the same time. There are also certain anti-emetic patches you can place on your body to help balance your inner ear.<br>  <br>  With that said, aim for taking your medicine of choice about an hour before you set foot on your new boat. It may sound odd, but having a very light meal in your stomach also helps!<br>  <br>  If you prefer a more natural remedy, try ginger! This can be taken fresh, in pill form, and even in teas. How much ginger is enough? When you burp and actually taste ginger... you've had enough. <br>  <br>  Focus on that horizon, and enjoy! Catch a big tuna for me. :D

Jm3vMKx3aa	The German law has age limitations for alcoholic beverages which are in general 16 years for drinking beer and wine on your own and 18 years for drinking hard drinks.<br>  Being accompanied by a parent and with his/her consent there are no age limits for drinking beer and wine in a restaurant.

Many have actually let flight attendants go because the number of flights has been cut.  I would not recommend looking for work in the airline industry right now. <br>  <br>  As for training, once hired, the airlines will put you through a training class.  The most important thing is how you present yourself during the interview.  The airlines will want someone who cares about the passenger and can effectively communicate with the customer.
sBCUKi5Yaa	If you got any itinerary when you purhcased this ticket or a receipt of any kind, locate the restrictions on this ticket fare. I think you have a roundtrip ticket fare which cost you 120 plus tax. If you cancelled this trip, your cancellation fee is 100, so you get back the balance or a credit toward your next trip. If you don't show up for your first flight, your return flight will automatically get cancelled. If this still confuses you, call spirit airlines and ask what your options are.
