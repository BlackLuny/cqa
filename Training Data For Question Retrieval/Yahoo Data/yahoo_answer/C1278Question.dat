20070627102650AAvJy4C	Science & Mathematics;Physics	How Can I Destroy An Iron & Glass Ceiling With Heat Or Cold?	Theoretically, is it possible to destroy a structure of glass, held together in an iron framework, with extreme heat or cold? (By destroy I mean have the glass panes fall out or crack and fall) How would it work?      Heat would cause the glass to expand, does that make it more fragile and crack? How hot would it have to be?      But could I also destroy it with cold? How cold would it have to be? And exactly how would cold affect the glass?

20090225081414AA3mAq3	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Need to find gamma in relativity question?	It's a bit more complicated than just that, however.  So we have in the Stanford collider, small bundles of electrons and positrons firing at each other.  The bundles are 1cm long and 10um in diameter.  In the collision, each particle has energy 50GeV, and electrons and positrons move in opposite directions.      1)I need to find how long and wide the bundles are in their frame.   2)The minimum proper length of the accelerator for the bundle to have both ends simultaneously in the accelerator in its own frame.    3)the length of a positron bundle in the frame of the electron bundle   4)and finally what are the momentum and energy of the electrons in the rest frame of the positrons      I'm stuck at phase 1 on trying to find the speed of the particles.  I'm not sure how I can deduce speed from 50GeV.  I was stumped on last weeks problem set with a very similar question -_- Any tips on the problems would be appreciated as well :)

20090227122900AAHePL0	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	Ok, this is an Evolutionary question about the footprint that was found in Kenya; what method was it dated?	Ok, I'm skeptical about the validity of Evolution and believe that the account in Beresheis (Genesis) is as believable as the Theory of Evolution.  As I've said before Evolution is an Hypothesis and has not been proven as a Theory.  I am a Math major and intend to either add Chemistry (maybe Biochemistry so I can work as a Forensic Chemist) or possibly Physics for a dual major.  My dad who is retiring this year as a police detective specializing in "cold cases" has over the years given me a lot of input in his "line of work" because as "daddy's little girl" I used to ask him all sorts of questions about homicide investigation and even though he didn't always think my questions were "appropriate" he often answered them because he kind of likes me and the way I would smile at him lol lol.  Anyway, daddy told me many times that you can't just accept scientific or forensic evidence but really have to question its validity.  For example, with impressions left in dirt or mud such as footprints or tire tracks you really can't date them except as what a witness says.  For example, a rainstorm that makes hard ground soft with someone saying the they had not seen these impressions before the rain will date the footprints or tire tracks during or after the rain.  So how can you say that these footprints are for some homonoid species that are in hard ground?  The reality is that there is no way to know their precise age; maybe 6000 years ago at the time of Creation in Genesis, maybe older or maybe younger.  Also, I recall from Biology that I took for an eventual  Math-Science degree when Evolution was discussed; I asked the professor what is a "proof" of an active human evolutionary process.  The answer was the size of the toes becoming smaller.  So it doesn't really look like that happened if you believe the age of the footprint. lol lol

20090307035618AALVyN5	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	HELP - Titration calculations - really long explanation!?	I completed a titration with the following:      - A mean titre of 24.875cm cubed Solution B, NaOH with a concentration of 0.125moldm cubed   - 2.1g liquid sample of HA, an unknown acid      I added HA with 250cm cubed distilled water in a volumetric flask to make a dilute solution to use in my titration; I used 25.0cm cubed in each titration (I used a glass pipette).      I completed a trial titration, then two actual titrations. The two actual titres were 24.85 and 24.90, so that's how I got the mean titre.      The first question is as follows: "Calculate the number of moles of NaOH used in the titration."   I used moles = concentration x volume; 0.125 x 24.875 and got 3.11 moles.      This answer has, in brief, fecked up the rest of my results. For example, I got 31.1 moles of unknown acid dissolved in the volumetric flask, which is clearly wrong.      Could someone please explain to me how I got these disastrously large answers before I go mad?      Thank you so much in advance xxx
20090307012358AAysemE	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	If there is less graverty on the moon, then why is that when the moon rover kicks up dust,?	but it falls straight down on the moon surface, also one of the men left a picture of his family on the moon surface, that picture shown on every show. there would be nothing left of it, as the suns rays would burn it with it minutes, true or not true, it's amazing how the government & NASA can get away with it & know one can do a thing. I feel that as long as the old saying goes the bigger the lie or story, then chances of it being true is the same a a grain of sand around the world or even better as much as the hubble's pictures of the known Universe every star out there.so therefore the average person will go on living in state of a complete lie if they listen to what the government's tell them.

20090306172919AAJBMXE	Science & Mathematics;Biology	I need help with this genetics problem?	Synthetic mRNA molecules were used to decipher the genetic code. The enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylase was used to synthesize these mRNA molecules. This enzyme does not use a template, so the incorporation of nucleotides is random.   Suppose you would like to generate a synthetic mRNA molecule that contains only adenine and cytosine.   a. What are the different triplet codon possibilities if the synthetic mRNA molecule contains only adenine and cytosine?   b. What is the probability that each of these triplet codons will be formed if the reaction contains 25% adenine and 75% cytosine?   c. Suppose the synthetic mRNA from part b was used to synthesize a polypeptide using the cell-free translation system of Nirenberg and colleagues. List the radiolabeled amino acids that will be incorporated into the translated polypeptides.
