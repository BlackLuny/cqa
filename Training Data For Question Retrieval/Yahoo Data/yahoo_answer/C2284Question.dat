Hey, for my English class, every block day (Wednesday) someone comes up with a presentation for the class. They can read something from a book, or read a poem they wrote, or whatever. Then they do something that the whole class can participate in, like a game, scavenger hunt, quiz, or anything, related to what you read. It's even optional to give candy/treats. And the point is to teach them something they can remember.  I chose to give a presentation a month from now.  Any ideas?  By the way, I'm a freshman, if that helps with your suggestions. I'm not very poetic, too.

20090202214834AA6qWvb	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How important are mid-year reports for regular decision admission decisions?	I'm talking specifically about USC. With the semester now ended I'll be sending off my mid-year report this week and I was wondering how much importance is placed on these grades? I don't have anything to worry about for the report -- I got a 4.0 with 4 AP classes and a college level Spanish class. But I'm wondering because some of my earlier, sophomore year grades pull my GPA down, which is probably the biggest problem with my application in terms of getting in, along with just okay SAT's. My EC's and essay, in my opinion, are pretty good, so I'm not worried about that. Here's what USC says about the mid-year report:      "We find that an applicant’s mid-year senior year grades can help us make better admission decisions. These grades can show how applicants handle some of the most challenging courses of their high school career, or they can further illustrate emerging trends in overall performance."      However, with that said I'm still nervous about getting in. I'm looking, preferably, for some answers from people who have some authority on the subject (ie: they know a lot about college admissions, were accepted to USC/go there, etc.). Are these mid-year grades something that could seal the deal, or are they not given much weight?

20090202225809AAAOZTP	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can anyone answer all these question?	Bill, an economics student, says, "This article makes no economic sense. It quotes someone as saying that the price of apartments will go up if jobs pick up in Santa Clara. But 5% of the apartments are sitting empty. Prices should go down when there is a surplus like this one."       Sara, the graduate teaching assistant for Bill's section, tries to explain to him why he might be wrong. (You have to answer her questions for him.)                          3.1.   Sara starts by asking Bill to picture a city with 100,000 apartments, so an occupancy rate of 95% means that 95,000 apartments are occupied and 5,000 are empty. "Now suppose," she goes on, "that 1% of all the apartment dwellers move out each day. How many apartments will become vacant each day?"                                    A.   1,200               B.   860               C.   500               D.   950               E.   740        3.2.   "Imagine," Sara continues, "that a few empty apartments have new people move in on the very same day that the old occupants move out. Others take longer. After all, even if lots of people are looking for apartments, it takes a few days for new tenants to come see one that has just come on the market because most people don't search every day.       "Let's assume that 19% of all the open apartments get new occupants each day. This means that on average, an apartment is empty for a bit more than 5 days.       "So if there are 5,000 empty apartments, then how many apartments get new occupants each day?"                                    A.   860               B.   1,200               C.   950               D.   500               E.   740           3.3.   "So you see that if 1% of occupied apartments lose their tenants each day, and 19% of the empty apartments are filled each day, then everything balances out if there are 5,000 empty apartments at all times. The number of apartments that become vacant (1% times 95,000) is equal to the number that get filled (19% times 5,000). So with these rates, 5,000 apartments will always be vacant. The occupancy rate will stay at 95% and the vacancy rate will stay at 5%.       "Next, things change. Suppose that a rich genie offers to pay everyone who rents an apartment in this city $500 per month. Surely this would lead to an increase in demand for apartments and eventually to an increase in the price of the apartments. I know this sounds silly," Sara says, "but bear with me. Sometimes when you want to get a sense for what is going on in realistic settings, it helps to start with a thought experiment that analyzes the effects of a more extreme case.       "Because no new apartments can be built in this city, supply and demand analysis tells you that when the genie offers a $500 payment to each renter, rents should go up by..."                                    A.   $1500 per month               B.   $500 per month               C.   $1,000 per month               D.   $780 per month           3.4.   "Now, to continue this thought experiment, imagine that at first, prices on apartments can't adjust because of rent controls imposed by the local government. Lots of people who don't currently rent in this city will suddenly start looking there because of the $500 payment that they can receive if they become a renter.       "In the ensuing frenzy, apartments are snapped up even faster than before. Now suppose that on average, 49% of all vacant apartments get new occupants each day. You'll see in a minute," Sara says as an aside, "why I picked this odd number, 49%. It makes the other numbers come out nicely.       "At this rate, the average apartment is vacant for about 2 days. In these conditions, what will the vacancy rate be in this market? To calculate this, continue to assume that 1% of all occupied apartments become vacant every day. I'll give you a hint and tell you that under these new conditions, you should find that 98,000 apartments will have occupants at any time, so 1% of these, or 980 apartments, become vacant each day.       "If 49% of the vacant apartments are filled each day, how many vacant apartments must there be for the system to be in equilibrium, with 980 vacant apartments filled each day and 980 that become vacant each day? After you calculate this number, divide it by 100,000 to get the vacancy rate."       "So the vacancy rate is: "                                    A.   4%               B.   5%               C.   3%               D.   2%         3.5.   "Finally, what would happen if the government removes the rent controls? You have just calculated the vacancy rate before the government lifts the controls. It is bigger than 1%. This means that every day, there are vacant apartments even in the midst of this frenzy of apartment hunting. But surely when the government removes the price controls, the rents on apartments will shoot up.       "And so," says Sara with a smile, "true or false? Prices can be rising in the market for apartments, even with a positive vacancy rate, and even when there are vacant apartments."

20090203011649AA91jPo	Education & Reference;Teaching	Should my ela teacher have done this honestly?	Ok so 2 years ago when i was in the 9th grade i was trying really hard to pass school so i wouldn't have to go to summer school or get kept back. But i had alot of absence's so i had to make up all the work in all my classes that i had missed (including ela) wich was never the less alot of work to do. But i still put a great deal of effort into doing as much as i could. But i honestly dont know if everything i had done for my make up work was correct or not. But other then that everything in my ela class that i was doing at the same time as other students i was doing really good,always getting good grades on my tests and doing my home work good and all that. Even the make work i was getting back were showing that i was getting really good grades. And i even asked my ela teacher b4 the grades came out what she thought i might get. And she told me probably a b or c wich might let me be able to pass. And right when she was giving us our grades for the last semester i had really thought i had done all my make up work cause she never told me i had anymore. Then i see that i got an f. On my report card not even a d or something. And i confronted her about that. And she told me Oh well, you didnt do all ur make up work thats why. And you didnt get everything correct on your make up work as well. But i told her then if i did have more work left y didnt u tell me i did and why were u saying i was going to get good grades b4 u gave me my report card,and y did u give me good grades on all my makeup work if i didnt get them all correct?. She didnt say nothing and just got defensive and thought i was getting to upset. and because of her i had to go to summer school and even my teacher in summer school said u got the highest score on ur ela exam so y are u here. lol so was what she did right or wrong? please be honest...   Because that 2 face bitc* really messed up my school life,and the screwed up part is that my mom believes the teacher over me no matter what i say.      Yeah and i pretty much had to repeat my ela class again because of her!

20090203015011AAjxxLE	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Am I being selfish about this? Please Read!!!?	We just moved house over the Christmas break, and I started my first day of my new school. I didn't want to move house and the school - I don't like it. Plain and simple. If I don't like the environment I'm in, I'm not able to learn.      I'm in my second to last year, so where I come from, it's a make it or break it year. Now, I don't like the teachers at my new school. They are definitely not the best to be quite honest.      I like my old school better. The teachers know me and what I am capable of achieving and they know my strengths and weaknesses and how to work around and with them to benefit me.      So, I was wanting to go back to my old school, but my dad is very reluctant to let me go back - as it's about an hour's drive away. I'll stay with my grandparents for the week, and come back home for the weekend.      My education is important to me and I want the best for myself. I think I would be better off at my old school, where I know I will pass and be able to gain entrance to university.      Am I being selfish for not accepting this new school, or am I doing the right thing by going back to where I am most comfortable in this make it or break it year?      [Don't say anything about how change is important - If I made the decision to go to a new school, I'd be happy. If I made the decision as to if I go to uni, I'd be happy. I'm happy with my own choices. Moving was not a choice I made]

Tax not my sloth that I   Fold my arms beside the brook;   Each cloud that floated in the sky   Writes a letter in my book.   Chide me not, laborious band,   For the idle flowers I brought;   Every aster in my hand   Goes home loaded with a thought.   There was never mystery   But't is figured in the flowers;   Was never secret history   But birds tell it in the bowers.   One harvest from thy field   Homeward brought the oxen strong;   A second crop thine acres yield,   Which I gather in a song.
