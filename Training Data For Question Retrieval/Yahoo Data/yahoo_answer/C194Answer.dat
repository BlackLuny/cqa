CPwdVc4caa	I smell troll...your last question stated that you were 6 weeks pregnant and wondering how to tell your mother.  You should put at least a page of questions in between your pointless and inane spam -_-|`|IoWoDxG8aa	yes|`|byGHdJIzaa	You can get pregnant only if you are ovulating. And yes, if any semen were still left inside of his penis, they came out inside you, and therefore you can get pregnant. But again only during ovulation. It is advised not to have sex 2-3 days before and after your ovulation day because the sperm can live for up to 48 hours and once you've ovulated, your egg can live for a couple days. Typically you ovulate 10-14 days after the first day of your period, however I myself ovulate exactly 3 weeks after the first day I start. A tell tell sign of ovulation is a thick discharge that has the consistency of raw egg whites. Usually you will have a lot on your toilet paper when you wipe and it will be stringy. So if you are trying not to have babies now, use protection and learn your body and how it functions. Hope I have helped!|`|SSlz82Djaa	Yes. Albeit a slim chance.<br>  <br>  The withdrawal method is MOST CERTAINLY NOT a good form of contraception at all! According to studies, semen can be released all throughout the act, not just when he ejaculates. Also, if he didn't 'wipe up' very well, then it also increases your chances that some semenal fluid found its way in. <br>  <br>  If you are not pregnant, (which is probably the case) you should get yourself to the doctors and get a contraceptive injection or a prescription for the pill if you are not going to use a condom with your boyfriend in future.|`|bcf6d0a7e790277666d07ee81dfc0e21aa	yes!!!<br>  its so possible because he has pre-*** and that's something that comes out before he "cums" its some little white, clear stuff that comes out when there horny also sperm swims! if its on ur "lips" they can swim up there u just cant see it|`|al4sga3Yaa	it just takes one of the guys to get in there usually the "one with the map'  good luck
3X0t8JrXaa	Well for me at 18 weeks the flutters started going away.  I started to get worried but on week 19 I started feeling obvious kicks.  So I guess movement hadn't stopped, just progressed to a different feeling to look for.  But in your situation because your pregnancy is a little more complicated I'd go into the doctor anytime I have a question.  Thats why they're there.|`|1SxVIZd7aa	it seems like nothing is normal in your case. i would call your midwife to get some reassurance. Thats what they are there for! Good luck :)|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	They should definitely have you on bed rest that is for sure.  I would call and get checked out because bleeding is always a cause for concern and anything can happen without you knowing it.|`|duinadV4aa	yeah call labor and delivery and see what they want you to do come in or not i would go in and be monitored if i was you|`|NMusNsb1aa	its fine i was freaken out too..but everythings fine with your baby..youll start feeling her/him more constanly when your 20 weeks or 24 weeks

MHOxPs8Oaa	You don't. They are your parents.|`|Rk87mqkoaa	Besides you don;t calling and contacting them (it's obvious you won't if you don't want them bother you), keep your phone number away from them, your address too. That should be enough. the basics are - change the info they have for you (but not your name and date of birth, haha).|`|VS78dqO9aa	depends on how old you are....IF you are 18 and older and want to ruin a relationship with the people who raised you,...change your numbers, move away...etc...<br>  <br>  BUT if you are not 18, then GO HOME.... no matter what the ordeal is, your parents are still your guardian until your 18, and you don't have a say.  Unless you get emancipated (divorced from them bascically).  BUt I don't suggest this.<br>  <br>  Either age though....one day you'll look back and realize how much family means to you.  Try to work it out|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I changed my name so my uncle wouldnt find me.  The state kinda made me do that.  Also got a restraining order.  Long story.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	I would be smart enough not to tell them WHERE I was going- in the FIRST place!  :)|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Why would you want to do that?|`|3ioUdPuZaa	You do it by running the risk of being considered the biggest A_ _ in the world and contacting a police officer who can advise you of harrassment laws where you live. But I THINK you have the "rules" wrong...just because you leave home, doesn't mean you leave your parents forever too!<br>  UNLESS your parents are Ax-murderers I WOULDN'T even think of it, if I were you. <br>  No matter what their faults, if they are trying to have contact with you then THEY LOVE YOU. What is it they could have done, to have you want to be so cruel?<br>  I cannot imagine what would drive you to even THINK of doing such a thing. My initial reaction is to scold you and tell you that with this question you have shown me that you are not grown up enough to be on your own...AND I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE 50!!! You might just need a little "whippin" that you DIDN'T get while growing up (assuming you truly have.)<br>  Do you truly understand the deep hurt and hole in the heart of your parents if you do this? And have you already created such a hole and deep hurt with words or actions?<br>  People make mistakes...let me say that again...PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES. Your parents are suppose to be perfect, but NO PARENT IS. Two wrongs don't make a right!<br>  It may not mean anything to you, but you are WRONG no matter what your circumstances are. In this world, we only get one mother and one father and when they are gone, ALL TOO OFTEN is when we realize all the value they had and the love that they tried to give us. <br>  I am a believer in Our Lord Jesus Christ and the teachings of the Bible. Honoring your mother and father was one of the 10 commandments and was important enough to God for him to make it one of the ten. It was also a commandment given with a "promise" from God. The Bible says that those who honor their mother and father should do so so that their DAYS ON THIS EARTH SHALL BE LONG.<br>  Yes, that means you can lengthen your life as a PROMISE from God by doing a GOOD job of honoring your parents!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  There isn't room for me to give you all the reasons you will be so sorry if you don't make peace with your parents. And apparently you are young enough you haven't lived long enough to know most of them. So all I can tell you, is BE THANKFUL you have parents SO devoted and find OTHER WAYS to solve any difficulties. You will be a better person for it and YOUR LIFE WILL BE A BETTER LIFE!<br>  Bunny7|`|DnNkCF6Taa	If your under 18 you are a runaway, if you are over 18 simply pay the extra money and have your number and address become an unlisted account.|`|yKS2UI87aa	Depends on how old you are over 18 tell them don't call. Under 18 and your kinda out of luck as you are considered a runaway.|`|WW5h93nTaa	ask them your going to the movies or your at a private school or at last a meeting

It didn't have to be a sexy song (hell they played She's Country by Jason Aldean), but they made it sexy.<br>  <br>  eta: If you want sexier dance songs, or songs easier to move your body to, here's a little list:<br>  <br>  I'm a Diva - Beyonce<br>  Get Like Me - David Banner<br>  Gimme More - Britney Spears<br>  Pieces of Me - Britney Spears<br>  Circus - Britney Spears<br>  Toxic - Britney Spears<br>  Shut Up and Drive - Rihanna<br>  Don't Stop the Music - Rihanna<br>  Heartless - Kanye West<br>  Right Now (Na Na) - Akon|`|2H6j4j8taa	You should use 'Take Me On The Floor' or 'Untouched' by The Veronicas or 'If U Seek Amy' by Britney Spears.<br>  <br>  'Womanizer' and 'Dirty' are okay, but 'Wake Up Call' is not sexy.|`|HQyVeaPPaa	dirty is!<br>  <br>  you should also try slave 4 u by britney spears<br>  or hips dont lie by shakira|`|AA12069058	Womanizer,Dirty,and Addicted are!

wRHhpanmaa	I would go ahead and use them both...<br>  <br>  if you are not sure, then there is no sense in taking a chance if you really love those two names.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of other really great boy names out there if you get pregnant with anther boy.|`|IDmaxViIaa	Wow I love your boys’ names and this is from my heart: I can tell by these boys names that you like that you have a beautiful and loving mind nothing sick about it. Your boy’s names sound so cute and loving. I love your boy’s names and how your loving mind came up with these lovely names. I think your names represent laughter and love! This is no Joke and don't think I’m a crazy person cause I’m not. <br>  <br>  I would use Jackson Cole now.|`|l9JfiYvZaa	I would split them up because if you name your current baby Jackson Cole, Cole won't get enough use. If you love both the names then they should both be dominant. If you really think that this will be your last boy though, then go for it, but if not, take my advice.|`|ryHdojcIaa	U should wait till the next baby name this one Jackson but also Cole is very cute also you could name him <br>  jackson Cody it is somewhat similar to cole|`|WniOOchkaa	I think you should go ahead and use Jackson Cole if you like it.  Your not guarenteed to have another baby or that it will be a boy so just use it now.  Also, if there is another who says you still can't use Cole as a first name?  Plus I'm sure you would be able to find another name if there is another baby later.|`|5QhfrmnMaa	wow mother of 5 just answered the same thing for another person, check it:<br>  <br>  Wow I love your boys’ names and this is from my heart: I can tell by these boys names that you like that you have a beautiful and loving mind nothing sick about it. Your boy’s names sound so cute and loving. I love your boy’s names and how your loving mind came up with these lovely names. I think your names represent laughter and love! This is no Joke and don't think I’m a crazy person cause I’m not. <br>  <br>  I love both but i no a little boy called Riley and he's really nice. So I say Riley.<br>  <br>  -------<br>  just changed the name for cheap points.. from the heart my butt! :-P anyyyywaayy.. I would use both, Jackson Cole has a very nice ring and you could still maybe get away with Cole for another child.|`|3cNYeVLJaa	Jackson Cole is coooooool. Use it, as you do love it. What if you have a girl? If you do have another boy, Coleman, Colton, Coulson?|`|beP3BOzfaa	Name the first one Jackson Cole, and the second one Colton Jack|`|cHuK9TLJaa	If you think thats this is going to be your only son, why don't you just use the whole name?|`|6O8aDk7naa	i would sy jackson cole because you dont know if your next baby will be a boy|`|xpUyH0psaa	I think you should just use jackson cole, so that you won't regret it if you don't have another boy. Also, if you use that now and the next child is a boy, you can still find lots of other boy names and you'll think of the next child as an individual to not use repeat name. But if you do continue to like the name, then you can find a longer version of cole and use the name as a nickname. Another idea is to give the next boy a different name with cole as middle.|`|AA11391968	The future is uncertain.  Use Jackson Cole.  By the time you have another baby there may be another name you'll like.
VS78dqO9aa	It's just the world today.  SOme people are just plain out racist, others just think they are cute... Me???  I think they are the most gorgeous kids in the world.  Their skin color, and eyes...  I plan on adopting a mixed child because in the US, they are considered "special needs" children in foster care.  It is the saddest thing for someone not to want them simply because of their skin color.  It's awful.  And it's not just white people...It's black people too!|`|JZK40k7Paa	they're wondering if he can be president one day.|`|iLLoc003aa	I don't stare...I don't think..but if I do its because I think biracial kids are such cuties and then I like to see who the child took after, the mom or the dad...both of my kids came out looking just like my husband. I am 1/2 Cuban and 1/2 White and my husband is Mexican...but I am really white with green eyes and brown hair and fair skin...so I always wondered if my kids would look like me or him. So I wonder about other peoples kids :) So If I do stare, its for that reason...not be to be mean :)|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I think people just stare a babies. I think any baby is adorable no matter the race. People stare at my daughter all the time and shes as pale a a piece of a paper ( seriously its a little scary lol) If they are older it may be because in there generation there wasn't very many biracial children. Try to just blow it off and take that they are staring not at the color of his skin, but the smile on his face, the sweet eyes he has and the cute way he looks at his favorite women.|`|DtGFWUP5aa	I think a lot of people stare because biracial people are generally a good looking bunch, and also sort of hard to peg, and people are curious. <br>  <br>  Also, sometimes people stare at them because biracial kids sometimes look like neither the mother or the father, and people are curious about that too.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	Ok well you may catch we watching children playing when im at work, as i love them and they are so cute and just amazing the games etc they come up with. I'm also thinking i want a child so bad! haha so yeah i think all children are cute and your baby is probably the cutest thing and that's what ppl are always looking at him!|`|QJRM2IEEaa	Some people are just ignorant...and others stare because biracial children are some of the most beautiful children. I think it' just one of those things you'll have to deal with. If someone does it a lot and makes it rather noticeable, just say excuse me and ask if there is a problem.|`|113FoyMFaa	Honestly<br>  <br>  I stare at anyone who is cute.  as does everybody.  And biracial children, IMO, are exceptionally cute.  I know a lot of people have that same opinion, so keep that in mind when you see people staring, it's hard to take your eyes off of something beautiful.|`|ufTY94Rkaa	Well, one of my good friends is half caucasion or w.e and half african american (in australia by the way, so unusual..) <br>  anyway, i think people are just pretty dumb..<br>  People see a dark skinned girl with a older blonde woman, and think<br>  "huh?"<br>  <br>  Also, sometimes i tend to look at people and think, wow, there pretty, and wonder what there heritage/race is.. (but thats just me haha)|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	I adore all children. I'm 26, wanting a baby with my husband,so....I tend to get gitty around all little babys :) I have to admit, the biracial babies I see are SOOOOO cute.|`|98qMZZPlaa	Because..... They are THE most Beautiful / Perfect children in the World. <br>  I didn't read the other replys, but if anyone is nasty about this, ignore them. Who cares. They would be jealous losers.|`|XzsmYWOqaa	Because bi-racial babies are just SO GORGEOUS!  People stare because they are in aaawh of their beauty.  I'd take it as a compliment.<br>  <br>  My niece is bi-racial and she is STUNNING!|`|atsypDapaa	i tend to stare sumthimes...<br>    i usually stare/glance bcuz they are jzt adorable little kids <br>  <br>  it has nothging to do wit being biracial?|`|VuUz8NgKaa	No, I don't stare at them but I do think biracial babies are really cute.|`|lnRMmSeyaa	i dont stare at biracial children and have never seen anyone???|`|yKS2UI87aa	I always look at cute babies no matter what race they are. Sometimes I even ohh and ahh. lol|`|99kKci9caa	A lot of people like to try and guess what the mix is. It could be black and white, or hispanic and asian, people just like to guess at it. Kind of like guessing the mix of a dog|`|270485338479c7d2f655fcad721d5383aa	Must be a realy cute baby|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Maybe they stare because he is cute, horribly ugly, acting up, because he's a baby, etc...  It more than likely isn't because he is biracial.|`|8j7FCEOraa	I dont think anyone stares at biracial kids<br>  <br>  Besides, there are so many I dont see what the big deal is<br>  <br>  Secondly, people stare at babies simply because they're babies. People think they're cute.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Because they're trying to figure out if YOU'RE the Mother !  :)   Don't worry about it... -Because if they DIDN'T look at your kid, then you'd have to start wondering, "Why not..?" !  :)|`|01Mu3wUeaa	They are probably staring because he is a little cutie.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I never do...but that's just me. Maybe they think your baby is just as beautiful as you do??|`|EMYImof1aa	maybe he's really cute!!!!! :]|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	Probably for different reasons.  I always look at little children because I love kids, Mine are grown but no grandbabies yet (fingers crossed).  I love to see kids and their parents and see who looks like whom.  Some people do think that mixing races is wrong and they get nasty about it, but that's just them being negative. At some point you will need to tell your son that some people are jerks and he doesn't need to be one or hang out with any. <br>  <br>  I am sure that your baby is so beautiful.  Enjoy him and ignore the nasty people to the best of your ability.  There are lots of unhappy people in the world who will try to make you miserable too.  That's the lowest form of sharing!|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I think they look so interesting and different compared to most kids. I dated a biracial girl she was gorgeous ( a ***** ) but very unique looking.  She had this long black hair and african american features but she was white...and part asian, then had these bright blue eyes.  I honestly think they arnt trying to be rude they just cant help but stare.  I dont try to stare for too long.|`|GlzVQclpaa	My daughter is biracial and she gets a lot of looks, usually accompanied by oh she is sooooooo cute! You can tell if people are staring at your child in a positive or negative way by their body language. You child is beautiful no matter who is looking!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I don't think they stare at him because he's biracial... they probably just think he's adorable!|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I actually just stare at baby's cause I love them, no matter what race they are. It might just be that people look at him cause he's little and cute.|`|ffd293aab0fb04b2c3f99065cb53c6b8aa	Just stare back at them and make them feel uncomfortable<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't stare but i am a people watcher!|`|NuJako4gaa	When I see people do that omg i freaking hate it! staring is extremely rude and all children were created equal|`|Ki0uUdwOaa	Maybe your son is just a cute baby?
PCK5bJt3aa	My daughter had chubby feet but now she also has a high instep and wears a wide. We used Pedipeds Originals before she outgrew the soft soled type and then switched over to Robeez Treds as a toddler. We dont have personal experience with the soft soled Robeez (opted for Pedipeds Originals which were less slipper like) but Pedipeds worked fine for my daughter with chubby feet.|`|Qo3zns1Caa	I would steer away from Robeez for a chubby baby.  My daughter is not chubby but the elastic around the ankle got tight on her as she grew.  It got better when I moved her up to the bigger size, but if they were pinching her little birdie legs then I figure they would probably be tight on a bigger baby.|`|LPFD3Vw0aa	robeez have elastic around the top so that they are adjustable and will fit almost any sized foot!|`|V4U65uidaa	i never heard of the shoe before but it sounds like it's for fat feet!|`|XwjL8PZCaa	not sure about the mini robeez I have not tried those I HATE HATE HATE the regular robeez they are horrible and cut into my sons ankle and left marks on them for weeks and he did not even have fat ankles! He is 2 1/2 now and we like the robeez tredz.  You should seriously consider trying see kai run or pedipeds. I would HIGHLY recommend the See Kai Run shoes they are WONDERFUL for fat feet! my sons feet were so fat! they are getting a little thinner now b/c they are so big but we started on See Kai Run at a size 3 and he is now wearing them in a 9!

Lor20kXcaa	She shouldn't have yelled at you, and ignore her.<br>  <br>  Ask your mom who the wall belongs to.<br>  <br>  If it's your wall, then you have all the right in the world to skate there, as long as your mom says it's okay.<br>  <br>  If it's her wall, then she can tell you not to, because it is her property.<br>  <br>  Skate on the wall opposite.<br>  <br>  When you see her next, tell her, always calmly, that your mother says it's acceptable and that is all the permission you need.<br>  <br>  Your mom probably doesn't know it upset you as much as it did, she's not a mind reader :), she didn't know you needed defending.<br>  <br>  If your mother allows you to skate on her ground, then that's perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  Have fun :)|`|d9b9ee65958fb5852143813b606e79a9aa	You need to ask permission because the wall is more than likely owned jointly by your family and the neighbor.  I can see the neighbor's point.  Did she really "yell" or are you just upset because she commented negatively on your behavior?  She should not have yelled, but she had the right to tell you not to skate the wall.|`|in7qi4oZaa	She was probably crazy!!!!!!!!!!!|`|sB5dyaczaa	Don't worry. She's just a cranky old neighbor|`|3ioUdPuZaa	NO it is never okay to yell at others, except under dire circumstances, like maybe if they are trying to KILL you or something. (attempt at a joke, here.)<br>  My guess is this lady thought you WERE a little too close to her car and YES skating on a wall WILL DAMAGE IT...my son creates those walls and repairs them, so I know this. <br>  But she should have chosen a much nicer way to approach the subject and ask you to not skate there. <br>  You must remember that once we are no longer youngsters we become "ugly ole trolls" that NEVER make enough money to pay the bills or take vacations. And WALLS cost big BUCKS, as do CARS! The wall, I could live without, but for us Adults, cars are a very important thing. One little dent could cost a thousand, or more, dollars to fix, and at a rate of $8 or so an hour, it would take a lot of hours of hard work to fix it! Yes there is insurance, but unfortunately when you "make a claim" it usually "raises your rates."<br>  It is GOOD for you to learn now, that the lady didn't have a right to treat you badly without you being ugly or mean with her, but SHE DOES have a right to protect her property from damage. And it is her right to have her property and use it the way she sees fit. <br>  You don't have a right to pose a threat of damage to any of anyone elses property. <br>  Your mother was right to NOT defend you...but if you were my child I would have marched you over to the neighbor ladies and had you tell her "You were sorry." EVEN IF the lady is the one who said things she shouldn't. THEN I would have very kindly asked the lady to please NOT raise her voice to my child again and I would have informed her to please come to me or call me with ANY thing you are doing that might be considered wrong or damaging. <br>  MOST of the time, if you would have just went to apoligize (irregardless of who was wrong) the other person suddenly becomes much nicer and also apoligizes along with explaining WHY she was so upset. It is IMPORTANT in this world to TRY HARD to understand other peoples troubles and points of view. <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Bunny7|`|DLJbkWPbaa	Well depending on if the wall is hers and yours then yes it was wrong and if you were in a situation where you could have hurt her car then that is wrong too. If she really yelled at you or made you feel upset I would say something to her but be polite about it and tell her you don't appreciate the way she talked to you and would appreciate it more if she would calmly explain to you her point next time something like this comes up. This is just my personal opinion though, I grew up in a family where I had a number of relatives who were very verbally abusive and mean to me and until I was older I never stood up for myself and it really affected my self esteem. For the most part if anyone really hurts you or makes you feel upset, you should tell them about it just remember to stay calm and if she acts like a mean old witch again just kill her with kindness. Good luck.|`|ixmaM395aa	Listen to mum, just don't worry about it. <br>  <br>  I feel your neighbor way over reacted and if she decideds it's her place to yell at you again remind her you're skating on YOUR property so she can just waddle back inside and mind her own business.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I don't think your neighbor should have yelled at you, I think she should just have talked to you about it.

OI3bf4yjaa	I don't think the age of the mother really matters. The only things that matter is her (and the father's) maturity levels, and whether or not they are mentally and financially stable enough to support a child. HOWEVER, I'm not saying that it's okay for 10 and 11 year olds to have babies. Kids who are THAT young are CLEARLY not ready for a child mentally and financially.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Bad idea? No.Certainly not the best though.<br>  <br>  You really cannot define a parent based on age.<br>  <br>  People have been popping out kids at a young age for centuries.<br>  <br>  I have seen a 16 year old mom parents her child better than a 42 year old mom of three.<br>  <br>  It all depends on the situation.|`|ajDohnPIaa	Well im a 16 year old mom..to a 1 and a half year old. <br>  It isn't the best idea...Because you still have to finish school..and all that..And have money.

But if you have the support...and the money..but want to lose your own self time...and stay up ALL NIGHT for the first 2 or 3 months...and you are going to finish school...then i guess..But from experience..if i knew it was as hard as it is..i would have waited|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I think if you are able to support a child in every way it is ok.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	The word mumma is bad|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Age doesnt say if you are going to be a good mom or not.|`|gM2eyQFKaa	I think it doesn't really matter on money or support or anything but if your ready or not.

I mean, I'm 28 and I just had my first kids, but I hope I am as good a mom as she was.

Not only have these girls physically not fully developed neither have they mentally.|`|VS78dqO9aa	nope!!!  My husbuand and I are 22 and 24 and we are in the process of TTC.  We are ready.  You just have to be sure you are.  Now, unplanned pregnancies at young ages, are hard, and teens should be more careful.  I don't see what it would be a bad thing.  We want our kdis to be able to grow up with their cousins, and my sister in laws already have 2 kids each, 8, 5, 3, and 1.  We don't want them to be too far apart.

Because teens must enjoy their teenage life and you cannot assure the money or support that you have.|`|Tr4Vj7RIaa	Some young women are better mothers that older women.  I don't think your age makes you a good or bad mother.|`|DLJbkWPbaa	Well I am not a parent and obviously I will never be a mom (cause I am a guy, yeah hope you got that) but I just recently had a best friend who got pregnant and had a child. When I say best friend I mean like Will and Grace, seriously I am a guy and I was her version of a Maid of Honor. Anyway I think it really depends on your own personal preference but besides financial support there are a number of other things to think about such as emotional support. Are you ready to give up your life for this baby and make sacrifices for this child. Essentially are you ready to give up your life and focus everything on this child's life and making it wonderful. I have seen my friend take a deep nose dive and I have had to back away and let her learn this lesson by herself but for the most part I would highly consider it and talk to other parents before making the decision. Good luck and have fun trying. By the way her pregnancy was unplanned and she was unmarried at the time, her and her husband are now separated. Also she is in her early 20's so she is done with high school but had to leave college.

YZEHQW15aa	I am going through the same thing.  It is normal but you should also talk to your Dr.  You can get post pardum depression up to 2 years after having your baby, at least that's what my OB said.  I personally feel that you are probably just tired and you probably haven't had a lot of "me time".  It is a life changing event and even though you aren't working he still needs to help with the baby.  You need to get some support because the baby gets especially busy after the first birthday.  They explore, walk, climb, start being a little fussy butt.  My son is 17 months old now.  Unfortunately some fathers don't realize how hard it is to take care of the child 24/7 and that having a child changes things and as a woman how it makes you feel.  I love my son unconditionally but after having him its like I lost myself, my identity.  I feel like i'm not marissa anymore but rather  I am known as Nicholas' mother but heaven forbid someone help you achieve both.  Sorry...I will stop now.   I just want you to know that I understand what you are going through and you are not alone.  Take care of yourself or you won't be able to take care of your baby and discuss your feelings with your Dr just to be on the safe side.  Just don't get on meds if you don't need them.  Don't feel you should have to take meds to deal with the father not helping.  Good Luck.  feel free to email me if you just need to have some kind of support or questions. mbice2@yahoo|`|m2aznd8xaa	yes its normal especially since your home all the time and your relationship isnt going good. he needs to help out more . you didnt have the baby on your own. if you dont talk with you man youll only get worse so talk to him about whats going on in your relationship. its better to speak about it to himthan to let it cotinue. youll get worse hun. he need to step up. just cuz he works dont mean he shouldnt help out. im a stay at home mom of 2 girls and married for 11 years.  my husband is very supportive and when he gets home from work hell take the girls off my hands for a little just to give me a little break. being a mom is harder than any job and we have no pay. think about it. we are moms, teachers. nurses and support systems and then some to our kids.  either work it out or move on sweety . you dont need him if he isnt supporting you emotionally and your child too.  sorry your going through this.   good luck|`|aMELFGh0aa	Postpartum depression is fairly common.

UTI's in pregnancy worse case..........death to the infant (NO JOKE). Also if you are pregnant they will prescribe you with a 3 day cream to put in your vagina at night time as you can not take it in a pill form.<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie and please before it gets any worse go and be seen by a health care professional.<br>  <br>  PS- If you can not do the following (highly recommended though) you can use homeopathic pills (will NOT effect child if you are pregnant) the brand is called AZO they have different strengths, one for UTI'S, one for yeast infections, etc.  Also drink plenty of water (to flush out system), and cranberry juice so the bacteria will NOT stick to your uterine wall.

LTTips1vaa	I lost my mucous plugs like 2-3 days before delivering.  The contractions don't sound very strong from what you are saying.   I'm wondering if there braxtons.  Ive delivered two naturally and when they were 5 minutes apart I was hurting (concentrating to get through them).  Try walking around the house and see how they changes them.  Are you still able to perform activities or they stopping you in your tracks?|`|irHF6CBPaa	You could lose your mucous plug weeks before you even go into labor or right at the hospital so it's not a good indication of when labor might start About labor what I felt a sharp contraction that did not go away with anything not even the epidural I had the epidural and I still felt each and every single contraction and I was in labor for 30 hrs(active labor about 16) hope that it does not happened to you you are almost there|`|f76962f01b7bcb351f389421efaca742aa	it sounds as though you you might be in the early stages although being your second it could rapidly change, i lost my mucus plug the morning i went into labour with my first and during labour with my second, give the hosp a wee phone if you are unsure and good luck on your wee bundle.|`|8C87ZfMwaa	I lost my mucous plug and had my daughter within 15 mins!!

1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	To give you an example as little as 6 cigs a day is as bad for a baby as cocaine.  Quitting cold turkey is the easiest,  I smoked a pack a day if not more and I haven't had a cig since I found out I was preg.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Talk to your doctor. My sister did the same thing and her kid was ok, but it really is playing with fire.|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	I used to smoke about a pack a day before I found out I was pregnant.  I quit as soon as I found out.  I think you should do the same.  If I can do it... you can do it.  The first 10 days were the hardest.  My first goal was 10 days.  By the time you get that far you will have enough will power to not want to anymore.  You can do it and you will feel so proud of yourself for doing something healthy for your baby.  I am 23 weeks now and there are times that I want to smoke, but the craving are not nearly as strong as they used to be.  Smoking a puff here and there does not work for quitting... trust me.  The nicotine stays in your system that way and you will continue to have cravings.  <br>  By the time I was 6-7 weeks I had morning sickness so bad I didn't want to smoke...<br>  By the way smoking can cause miscarriage and when you smoke your baby is smoking and I know you don't want that.<br>  <br>  You can do it!  Good luck:)|`|6TuxC5BLaa	Yes your baby might have some medical issue because of you smoking, so please quit now. If you can do it 1 or 2 aday then i think you can stop completely.|`|k9nLue0Uaa	thats perfectly fine and your trying to quit which is very hard to do. My doctor even told me its not good to quit just like that cause it can cause even more stress. But keep up what your doing, good job!|`|S4DNQkFraa	It can harm you, so DUH it can so harm your baby. Read the label. It can cause low birth weight as well. You should stop all together and try something healthier. G/L!!|`|xprwl2Cpaa	Hi there<br>  I'm currently 6 weeks 6 days and haven't smoked for 2 whole days since my BFP - it may not sound like much but to a smoker it's an amazing start!<br>  I got a self hypnosis book called 'stop smoking in one hour' by Susan Hepburn (with 'free' cd) off my sister for Christmas - I must confess that i'd never even opened it yet - until I got my BFP the other day.<br>  That night as I went to bed, I put the cd in the player (I still haven't actually read the book) and set it away - hoping that in the morning I would wake up never want to smoke ever again!<br>  Maybe it's because I knew in my heart and in my head that I needed to, and wanted to do this so much, for my unborn child - maybe that's why it has worked.  It's early days but I just don't want a cigarette at all - and trust me, that's pretty amazing, coming from a person who has smoked about 10 a day, EVERY single day for years!<br>  I wish you all the luck in the world with quitting and good luck with your pregnancy X|`|5d3c73347559d1d18aaad74a28eead0faa	oh my god i cant believe some of the answers people have given! yes it is risky and is best to quit but it is hard i tried to quit whilst pregnant but couldn't i smoked about 7 a day so u having 1-2 is better than i did! my son was a month old yesterday and is perfect and he weighed 8.1lb when he was born so no low birth weight worries with him! so good luck with the giving up but if u cant just having 1-2 a day is so much better than having 20!! congrats x x|`|fKhjdqCGaa	There is no for sure answer that it will cause permanate damage to the fetus, but the chance should scare you enough. I am sure it is very hard to quit but yes it could cause your baby serious problems. Best wishes. I hope you can quit soon:) And congrats on your bun in the oven:)|`|R8VhFeEVaa	It is hard. But you don't want your placenta to be unhealthy. It will come out looking like hamburger if you smoke too much and your baby will be skinny. They're supposed to be fat and healthy. <br>  You can smoke again in like 32 weeks. Its not that long. Tie your hands behind your back.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Risks:<br>  <br>  Premature baby<br>  Calcified Placenta<br>  Low birth weight<br>  fetal death<br>  fetal tuumors and cancers<br>  child hood cancers|`|wxImZRssaa	I had the same trouble, your doing well. I know its hard. You'll get there in the end. :)|`|g6sCUoO7aa	Are you that stupid? Of course smoking will harm your baby. Don't be so selfish, quit your bad habit NOW.|`|Bc4ZDVk4aa	i smoked 20 a day and quit when i was 7 weeks pregnant im 14 weeks pregnant now. i found it easier at the beginning now id give anythin for a cigarette but i wont give in i keep thinking of my baby when i get a craving and it goes away again..drink plenty of water..also you are doing very well cutting down to 2 thats brilliant so be proud of yourself for that..my doc also said that sometimes the stress of quitting can cause more harm to the baby so dont be to harsh on yourself you are doing very well..|`|JEAsvaVXaa	no need to stress yourself out! Of course everyone wants to quit everything, but to ease your mind, i had toxemia with my third, i wanted to quit too,but my preg specialist doc told me quote "all doctors have to tell you not to, but in most cases with even problem pregnancies it puts even more stress on the mother and baby just trying to quit and can be even more harmful, the only thing smoking cigs effects is the birth weight from 1 to 2 pounds", but of course if you cant quit cutting down as much as possible is great. My baby was small but perfectly healthy, I too cut down alot, it is really hard! good luck, i hope i could help a little.|`|azE51WGRaa	I understand it's hard to quit smoking when pregnant because it has been for me. While I haven't been able to quit completely, I have cut down a lot (which is better than nothing). Addiction is hard, especially when it's cigarettes. It doesn't absolutely mean you will have a small baby...my son has measured big for my week (i'm 37 weeks now), and his heart and everything is perfectly fine. If you want to try your hand at quitting, there are a lot of support groups out there to help you. Good luck.|`|56YFjZxAaa	im going through the same thing now, being stressed about being pregnant and what could go wrong makes it even harder. Just do the best you can. Every less cig. counts. Your doing better then i am...but i found out i was pregnant today. lol|`|AA12041097	My friend's doctor told her five a day was okay.  My mom smoked during both her pregnancies (I don't know how much, but say 3/4 of a pack a day) and both me and my brother are fine and had good birth weights and APGARs.|`|AA11317789	It can. Smoking can cause a lot of birth defects and low birth weight. <br>  <br>  Nothing is more important than the little one, so you just gotta put it aside for the next 35-ish weeks.|`|0b2ef9a3e7c926e3a31797a952055e0eaa	it wont exactly harm the baby but most likely act a hole lot different from every one else just take it from someone with experience|`|t7OPDZDXaa	you are doing great...  just keep going til you have quit completely.<br>  stressing your body by going cold turkey is not going to help your baby either.<br>  good luck hun|`|oUGiIhegaa	yes it will, guess its too late now though, good luck with the single parenting lads. =D of  niceness
qvU9J2toaa	well dat is pretty crazy cause in a way i can relate 2 you cause i turn 18 pretty soon nd my parents are protective 2 also i can go out but they want like a million ques i think dat you should talk wit them nd tell dem how u really feeling i kno its hard nd u got a boyfriend but i think dat u should get a job nd move in with your boyfriend i mean dat wat ive would have done ive tried runnig away one time 2 i kno its a hard thing 2 have parents like dis but also show dem dat u r a adult and u want 2 be treated like one i mean i would have left my house if i waz in your pession but just try 2 talk 2 dem ill be honest i dont like my parents sonmetimes i  feel like i dont think they care enough about wat ive got 2 say like i kno tha world is a hard place nd they worried wat might happen but den again u a adult u make you own dision nd if u have dont good nd u should let dem kno cause its not good 2 stay alone nd do not have anyfriends but i think dat u should do dis cause my parents can be like dis 2 so datz how much i can help u at dis moment|`|pXB83EJfaa	heys.<br>  well firstly, you're old enough to live on your own and your parents need to understand you can bar them. consider living at your boyfriends or something. its ridictulous that your  parents cant understand they are lucky to still have you.<br>  x good luck|`|5QhfrmnMaa	My parents were the same way.. it got much better once I went to college. If you're 18 you shouldn't be too far away from that. I chose an out of state college 3 hours away so they couldn't control me down here.. it's wonderful. :)<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|vNgDz5Jnaa	I'm not sure of your situation but if you really feel that way, get a job and move out.|`|bTMdpMW9aa	Get a job and leave. Tell them that they can't tell you what to do cuz they can't. Next time your boyfriend asks you to come over, just go. What are they gonna do? Call the police and say you ran away?|`|eFGXMRsGaa	Well you are 18, you are legally an adult and can do what you want, but when you live under your parents roof its a totally different story they still  make the rules. Save up money, rent a house live with friends, there are many things you can do to get out of this situation. And the major one is to move out.|`|iOv9tbULaa	I'm 23, and I still have issues with my parents. I live at home right now while I'm not in college because it costs alot and I have so many bills. And you know, what? When I cam home after 2 years of doing whatever I wanted, they still made me check in. I can stay out as long as I want, but they still try to treat me like a child and say they don't approve me dating...and I was on my own, doing God knows what because they weren't there. It sucks, but my best advice is to go away for college. Go away and the find an apartment. I planned on moving out a while back, but I's rather just save my money and wait till I enroll in college again. It's really annoying having to be at home, but if you can afford it, MOVE OUT.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. :)|`|ajDohnPIaa	Didn't you just ask this question?<br>  Get a job. and Move out.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Like others have said, get a job and, move out.|`|nzyOCsOiaa	well, if you can't do nothing.<br>  then you can do everything.<br>  just saying.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Get your own place.<br>  <br>  Their house, their rules.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  eta: i know that sounds harsh, but it's the way it is.  I live with my parents, i'll also be 19 in april, and my parents do set rules for me.  I still do housework, and my parents "prefer" for me to be home before midnight, and I still have to ask if my boyfriend can come over.  I'm not allowed to spend the night at his house, and I have to let my parents know where I'm staying if I'm staying somewhere.  It's their rules, and I abide by them, because I live here for nearly free.|`|Tr4Vj7RIaa	I have a 21 yr old daughter and a 17 yr old son so maybe I can help you understand your parents point of view.  <br>  Are you still in school?  Do you work?<br>  To your parents you are still their "little girl" but also they are just trying to keep you out of trouble and safe. First of all you need to start small on your requests ask if you can go to the movies with your friends, tell them which friends.  Don't ask to go out on school nights because they probably wont let you and that's an unnecessary argument.   When you ask to go somewhere you need to be specific don't just say "can I go out for a while" say "can I go to the movies with ______ and ______  the movie let's out at 9:00 I'll be home by 9:30".<br>  If they still will not let you go out then you may just have to wait until you get your own place.|`|nZPGdcKJaa	sit down and have a calm and mature discussion about this with your parents over dinner for something.<br>  present the problem and a fair solution, then negotiate.<br>   suggest NOT comparing yourself to anyone else during this talk.  Just tell them about your life, what you want from them and why. You need to make them feel like they can trust you and they dont need to protect you so much<br>  <br>  You can always move out and live on your own. You are 18.

xtmFBjO9aa	Heck yeah!  I feel like that about this OB that I saw a few weeks ago.  he treated me just like that.  Find yourself and OB that will listen to you, and ask if you have any concerns or not.  This is a time in a woman's life when we need that extra attention and assurance.  Switch doctors without delay.  I am 17 weeks and switching as well.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	they are all like that becuase they are busy people.. when you go in there you have to MAKE them spend time with you... ask them all of your questions and make them explain things to you... all the docs are like that and if you dont make them stay with you then they wont.. also if you get early morning appts it wont take so much of your time.. most people do it in the afternoon so the docs are more busy.. have them schedule your appts in the early morning 9 or 10 o clock and you will be in and out so fast|`|y5sWmbtnaa	I am 35 weeks and 4 days and I am miserable with my doc I felt the same way you do now months ago and i regret not switching sooner! Plus not only is he impersonal he is a moran i think!|`|bkOn30I1aa	My doctor, nurse and midwife have been great and very personal, let me add that they also have a lot of patients to see but they are always so nice, welcoming and caring...you should change for sure!!!|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	hmmm....sorry, but that's how it is.  They are not there to sit with you and visit for hours.  At your stage of your pregnancy, you should have only had 2 appointments.  And there's nothing else they can do besides listen to the heartbeat.  I'm not quite sure what you are expecting when you go in, but you shouldn't expect much more.  Remember you are not the only mother to be that needs to go in and see that same doctor.  Usually my appointments only last about 15 minutes with the doctor.  I am 30.5 weeks with my second and do not expect much more from my appointments.  My upcoming appointments will be getting longer when they start doing exams and we start talking about our birth plan and stuff like that, but until then, don't expect to be there for an hour and it's like that with almost every doctor.|`|yM9rg43Yaa	Actually alot of OBGYN's are like that....I guess they just see it everyday. Not all of them are like that though. The fact of the matter is most appointments are pretty routine anyway unless you are high risk, but if you are not happy with this find another one now before you are further along.|`|56YFjZxAaa	I know what you mean. You need to trust your doctor and have a great relationship with them. Find a doctor who cares... And its a big deal maybe not now but you will be glad in months to come.|`|DXZK6eMNaa	Just because your friends and family are excited, and you're totally focused on your baby doesn't mean that you're the center of the world.  Get over yourself.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I had a midwife and she was wonderful.  <br>  <br>  Very caring and answered questions and we never felt rushed.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Definelty switch now if you are not comfortable. You are still fairly early on so it shouldn't be a huge deal. The longer you wait the more likely it is that when you switch you would have to repeat a lot of tests and things. Find a doctor you like.

I ate half a bag to myself within 2 wks. When I started actually craving that, I knew something was up. (I also wanted water all the time) And at random times, I'd want a milkshake with fries in it, which I normally ate, but I said it out loud once and one my friends looked at me and asked me if I was pregnant. I also wanted apple juice and blueberry flavored things. Then it went on to ice cream and mac and cheese, as well as tacos and lasagna. Now it's a variety of all that and then some. I eat so much!!

Vad64Jjoaa	I always dress her up no matter what. In my house you never know if somebody is going to just drop by univited ( it happens quite often ). So I have my little one dressed in dresses or cute little outfits all the time. The way I look at it is if nobody is around to see her atleast I got to see her, and she is always so adorable no matter what she is wearing! BTW she is 8 1/2 months|`|OfLyP6mgaa	Well, I like to keep my son in sleep-n-plays (the one piece outfits), but am slowly finding that he outgrows them in length very quickly! He's 7 weeks old, and can't stretch his legs out all the way in the 0-3 months size! I have the same problem with pants. Pants are trickier though, because if I go up in size, they just fall off because his waist is still too skinny! :) So typically, he's just in baggy sleep-in-plays, unless I can find pants that are snug enough around the waist to go up a size, which is what I prefer to do since separates are cuter! :)|`|MeYILJeSaa	If we're around the house I usually put him in the sleepers and such. They're just easier for changing him and stuff.<br>  But if we're going out, I use it as an opportunity to put him in his cute outfits and make him look 'extra' cute. Today, we went to lunch with my grandparents and he wore a onesie with jeans and a grandpa cardigan with tennis shoes. He looked like a little man! It was so cute! :)<br>  <br>  My son will be 4 months on the 15th. :)|`|93JgYS4Vaa	I don't have a little one yet, but my nephew gets to run around the house in just his diaper. Of course his mom checks his temp regularly but he doesn't usually wear a lot of clothes. saves a TON of laundry :)|`|hcwp2mAyaa	My (almost) 6 mo baby girl wears either pj's or a onesie to bed. During the day she wears dresses or 2pce sets. When we go out she wears a dress, headband and a pair of maryjane shoes|`|kQPdGuT5aa	Little t shirts and jeans, or sweat suits. She has a lot of dresses but unless its warm out she doesn't get to wear them|`|n6XYYyoLaa	usually sleep n plays around here, she just crawls around and gets whatever she's wearing dirty; i girly her up to go out though! the other day for instance, we went to dinner with friends and she had on tights, matching top, jean dress with tiny pink hearts on the pocket and a headband with a very small bow; it was adorable! :)|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I usually only put those one piece outfits on for sleeping too!  I just feel like she's in Pj's all day when she wears them.  So I usually put outfits on her.  We do have more comfortable one for her when we're home, and more dressed up ones to go out in.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Well, I'm in Minnesota and it's quite chilly, even in the house sometimes. So, my daughter usually wears pajamas. She's 3-weeks-old. Otherwise if it's warm enough I'll put a cute warmer outfit on her. When she gets older and it gets warmer though I'll have her in cute little dresses and 2 piece outfits.|`|wFVLP5l3aa	depends on the weather i live in melb oz so one day we can have 45 degree celcius and the next have 15 degrees weather<br>  on hot days usualy a short sleved legless onsie<br>  and on cold days singlet, onsie, pants top and when we go out a jumper on top|`|OgzHcNMsaa	My daughter is ALWAYS in footed sleepers unless we're going out. We live in Canada where it's always cold. lol. Just kidding. But I dress her in a onesie and then a footed sleeper over it.|`|14JQ11AUaa	Long sleeve onsie or a onsie polo and some jeans.
xtmFBjO9aa	Its like one in a million chance because it was during your period and then you have the birth control pills as well.  Dont worry too much.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Most likely no. You don't need to take the sugar pills so that would not effect anything. The pill stops you from ovulating so most likely you are ok.|`|ATBHG0ztaa	It is possible to get pregnant on your period. Also, I suggest scheduling a time to take your BC every day. Set an alarm on your phone. I generally set mine for a time when I knew I would either be A) winding down for the evening or B) getting ready to go out, but a time I wouldn't yet be out at. It's easier than first thing in the morning because some people don't always get up at the same time. It's very important to maintain a strict schedule. That's the only way that the pill is 99% effective.|`|ACGBj2liaa	anything is possible, if you  want a lesser chance to get pregnant make sure to take pills when you are supposed to and have him use condom, still not a guarantee though|`|Le1mibkIaa	Very very unlikely ! You ovulate 2 weeks after the last day of your period .... and sperm only lives up to 72 hours Hope that helps<br>  Mommy of a week old baby girl|`|SZOONQ1zaa	It is possible, though not very likely|`|1PAFN8avaa	It is Very possible. If you don't like taking the pills or are bad at remembering when to take them, I recommendgetting the shot or using Nuva-Ring. I hear nuva ring has the highest percentage of not becoming pregnant and you only have to remember to remove it once a month as opposed to  every day.|`|56YFjZxAaa	anything is possible, do you know when you ovulate? And how close it is after your period. The chances are low but it could happen.
UC9Wjjscaa	I does sound a little unsafe. I would rather be safe than sorry.  I know it is impossible to watch ever thing they do.  That is why we childproof. I would try gating it off or even just sit something in front of it for now. Something that will keep him from getting to it. Possibly even put something heavy on a bottom shelf like  cinder block or two.  Then cover them with something soft so he does not hit his head.  Won't be that pretty but baby would be safer.  I had a tank on an older metal stand when my son was little.  It had that shelf on bottom and I used the cinder blocks and it worked great.  It weighted the bottom so it would not rock.  Baby is going to be drawn to the tank cause that is pretty cool to look at.  I wish you luck.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Well,  when he starts the climbing phase during toddler time its definetly going to be more unsafe. <br>  <br>  Perhaps relocationg it to somewhere he doesn't spend time with, or gating it off would be a wise decision. <br>  <br>  Its always better safe then sorry.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	The six foot tank is not unsafe, but the fact that it rocks (you mention the floors are not totally even) IS unsafe.  If that tank falls onto your child, it is most likely going to kill him.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would either get one of those outdoor play yard things and make a fence around the aquarium, so he can not get to it, or put it in a room where you can close the door.  Like you said, it is better to be safe now than sorry later.  At this age, they are fast-and even the most diligent parent can not watch every single move they make. Since it is a "no-no", it is also likely to be the first thing he goes for when he gets a chance.  Act now, to avoid tragedy.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	I think putting it away is a bad idea as he would forget about it and when you would try to pull it out again, the fascination would start all over. He would just be bigger.<br>  <br>  When you see him on it make sure you take appropriate discipline as for his age. He will get used to it and get bored, eventually just leave it alone all together. I think it could eventually become unsafe if he gets bigger and won't leave it alone. Or if he persists at it and gets a good rock to it.<br>  <br>  Good luck I hope this helps!|`|GNLYxY7kaa	i would be safe then sorry......as he gets older he is only gonna rock it harder ......esp as a toddler. maybe put it in the garage until he learns touching it is a no no|`|6AvVVzsnaa	Oh yes, he can drown in it so don't let him get near it.|`|XCDd3hELaa	Well, it shouldn't be a problem just pull him away and say no firmly so he gets the idea. Just make sure you keep a close eye on him maybe you could get a sturdier tank stand or something. But if you want to be extra safe you could downgrade your tank to a smaller one and then keep it up where he can't get to it. Then if you want to be safe safe you could take it out all together.|`|47b941d3c5e5316f5f468cc99f1c559faa	It sounds a bit unsafe. Would it be possible to find a better stand for it. I know it would be a pain to move but it would probably be worth it. Is the stand you are using made for a tank that size? I have a 55 gallon tank and it won't budge even a little on it's stand.|`|S3t69kh2aa	For sure, he needs to learn this is off limits.  He should not be constantly climbing up on the tank.  What are you doing while he is climbing on it?  There are many things he will need to stay away from:  irons, electrical outlets, etc.  You need to teach him not to.|`|d1ZWtAFWaa	Um yeah, that is just a bit unsafe. I wouldn't just be worried about the fish tank falling over. How about the child falling into the tank.
BvJKu7cGaa	i have pcos also and my husband and i have been ttc since july. i am waiting on blood work to come back and waiting for my cycle to start so we can try to figure out when and if i ovulate because my cycles are irregular. after that i will probably start clomid and maybe metformin also. just try to stay positive. reading about other people with the same problems that got pregnant has made me feel better. it make me tell myself not to lose hope!!! talk to your dr about your options and good luck ttc~!!!!|`|AIskV0efaa	i also have pcos, i am on metformn. i was on clomid for 6 cycles and it did nothing. everything i read states that clomid dosent work as well with pcos but metformin has been amazing it seems. i have heard almost 90 percent of women get pregnant within 6 months of starting metformin. the hard part about metformin is the sick effects, they are wicked nasty but if you can bear with them and get thru the first 6 weeks your golden. lots of luck to and baby dust. hope this was helpful.|`|v4sIlwKoaa	join the group!! me and my hubby have been ttc #1 for 9 months now with no success! I have PCOS and thyroid problems! I would suggest seeing a fertility specialist and asking about clomid and metformin.. I have heard lots of good things about those 2 meds! good luck and tons of baby dust xxxx!|`|Npy1kswWaa	Hey guy try fertility blend or google it.|`|hmL1Jtkmaa	***** all day.
UdICTUnaaa	he's perfectly fine<br>  he needs the social interraction so much that crying occassionally is worth it.<br>  i know how you feel,i went into daycare and saw other babies crying and asked them about it... they were like "babies cry sometimes"<br>  <br>  true enough...|`|Tr4Vj7RIaa	If you are uncomfortable leaving him at day care you can find other ways to socialize him with other children.  Also before you choose a day care you should always check it out thoroughly before leaving your child there.  Find out if they have had any complaints filed against them and what the complaints were.  Talk to other parents.  Stop by unannounced.<br>  If you are worried about the care he is receiving there ask yourself these questions.<br>  Does he get stressed out or really upset when you take him there?<br>  Does he seem happy and content when you pick him up from daycare?|`|hSJnaysiaa	The thing about daycare is that sometimes he won't be the top priority, which may be good for him to learn.<br>  <br>  Daycares provide care for many kids, not just yours, so if he's crying but there's something else going on, the provider may need to handle whatever else is going on before soothing your child.<br>  <br>  I think its great for kids to be exposed to other kids. And like you said, he has developed quite a bit just since being in that environment so it must be working for him. As a parent its tough to hear your child cry, but it may be in his best interest to learn now that A) crying doesn't always get him an immediate response from an adult so he might learn to self soothe some, might just learn to not cry as much too. And B) No one cares for him like mom does. Mom will always put him as number one whereas at daycare he is one of the crowd, not always the center of attention.<br>  <br>  I doubt the provider meant to let your child cry, no one likes to hear crying, but childcare providers can't always stop what they are doing for another child. That would be favoritism.<br>  <br>  Its normal to feel guilty. And your son is still quite young too. But, in the long run these are valuable lessons for him to learn, and afterall, its just a few hours a day.|`|yKS2UI87aa	First of all you are his mom and if you don't feel right with the situation than look for another day care. What is the ratio between providers and kids 1 povider to every 3 kids? I know I decided on a babysitter versus a daycare for my son until he's 3. One on one attention was the biggest plus, and she had worked at a daycare so the teaching part was a big plus. Not every babysitter is good my friend's son's only sits on the couch and watches tv Even though it's one on one it's not a good situation. I am VERY picky and started looking for someone when I was only about 7 months pregnant.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Well of course you feel like that he is your baby! But from an outsiders point of view, honestly it doesn't hurt to let them cry for a second. As long as she is saying I'm taking care of so and so I will be right there, she is paying him some attention. That's more then likely how he got to crawl and pull up and also walk so fast in a week bc no offense but at day care no one kid is number one. So he has sorta adapted to doing things for himself, since you aren't at his beck and call. I don't mean any of this in a bad way so please don't take offense to it, I know how you feel bc I too am like that with my little one and he is 2 lol. Good luck|`|uCLenopbaa	does he seem uneasy about going to daycare? <br>  if not, than they were probably just busy when you happened to walk in.<br>  does he go because you are working? if you want him to have social interaction you can take him to a park or something..<br>  maybe considering switching daycares, that have more staff or less children.
AA11853447	Well, every woman is different and experiences pregnancy differently. <br>  <br>  I had a stuffy nose and it's bloody when I blow my nose (I had never had a bloody nose until pregnancy). But, that didn't come until later. I didn't generally get headaches. However, I'm always warm, but I was like that before getting pregnant. <br>  <br>  It seems like all your symptoms are caused by your increased blood volume in your body. Your heart is pumping harder to get more blood pumped to your uterus, so all of those symptoms can be caused by just that one thing-- and NO it's not too early to experience any of those symptoms! <br>  <br>  I didn't have morning sickness either (thank goodness), but I did get really weepy pretty randomly, just like you. <br>  <br>  It sounds like everything you're experiencing is normal! Keep up the good work and congratulations!!|`|rHufcHwHaa	I am in my 20th week of a perpetual stuffy nose...suddafed helps and it is an approved medicine, but I try not to take it every day.  I also have bloody noses when I blow which freaks me out, but doctor said it's normal.  I also get headaches and am ALWAYS hot (except for my stomach...it's always ice cold to the touch...weird!) <br>  <br>  I think that these are normal pregnancy symptoms.  I wouldn't worry if you're not experiencing any other symptoms, especially if your doctor thinks everything is okay.|`|6TuxC5BLaa	Every woman has their own pregnancy symptoms, if you are pregnant and this is what your experiencing then it's ok the only thing i am not sure is the nose bleed and headache. Why not go and see your doctor asap, just to be on the safe side. But i hope you are not taking any medication for these. Good luck.|`|NBNBKWchaa	Sounds like you have a cold or some thing coming<br>  Not everyone get morning sickness<br>  Breaking into tears will be you body changing, your hormones will be all over the place<br>  Everything sounds fine to me but if you are really worried get a check up from your Doctor or midwife. <br>  Congratulations and Good Luck|`|7Wb0bazTaa	Oh no, not very good at all. Just kidding.!  your fine.|`|86PuYgDJaa	I'm 9 weeks too. I always have a stuffy nose and whenever i blow it there is some blood, not much though. I wake up in the night sometimes really hot. I've only had one headache so far and I put that down to not drinking enough water that day because I was on a training course at work and we didn't have many breaks.<br>  Another thing I have noticed is when I go to my mum's house or my friend's house who have cats I feel as though I am alergic to them which I wasn't before and my eyes itch and water and I sneeze all the time. I have a cat myself but never feel like that with her!<br>  Other than that I feel fine - haven't had any morning sickness yet but have been very tired but that's starting to get better now.|`|856df45cd220b8db7117dd899c6e5ae2aa	Completely normal.  I always thought it was weird that being pregnant would make you have a stuffy nose, but it sometimes does.  I wouldn't worry....all sounds just like.  You are experiencing the first wonderful parts about being pregnant.  Much more to come....don't worry about it.
LOERlSFEaa	You aren't pregnant if you didn't have sex with the guy... or at all...<br>  Don't worry bud. <br>  No sex, no kid. :)|`|FZ0hwowaaa	No...you are not pregnant...perhaps there are many factors causing the delay in your periods. Still you can go for a simple test later if you have doubts. Pregnancy test kit from your chemist/pharmacist.|`|Foi6PFWQaa	Um...no.. -_-'|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	lower back pain is like cramps, you get it before/during/after your period too. the chlorine probably would have killed the sperm, and even if it didn't, you'd know if he came in the pool with you. i would have to say you're not pregnant.|`|56YFjZxAaa	im pretty sure your not. Even if he did ejaculate in the pool the cleaning supplies would have killed it. i have never heard of anyone getting pregnant through clothes.|`|wZ9YQc3Caa	u cant get pregnant by just sitting by the guy.|`|JLsZ1mD1aa	if you have NEVER had sex you have NOTHING to worry, you cannot get pregnant without having sex..duh

And morning sickness, fatigue, weird dreams, and eating a lot.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Frequent urination and fatigue started on the first day. I was urinating every 15 minutes one day.

I found out i was pregnant at 4 weeks.

6EXOZu6Vaa	the 4 year old needs to learn life lessons. id give him a thorough spanking if he ever swear or if he ever tries to hurt you/throw something at you. you can give him soap or hot sauce if he back talks or swears. that always taught me so my parents only had to do it 3 times. you know what worked great for me is the sore arm trick. i made this method up and i have told my friend who said he loved it so he told his friend and his friend hated it. basically you put the in timeout and since the 4 year old is short, he is perfect. anyways you stand them in time out an you put their arms hanging on something. its like a cross except their are no nails lol. you tell them to stay like that for 7 min and if they move, you add a minute. talk to them while they are doing that and tell them to appoligize and ask them if they are ready to come out. or i used to be a boyscout (i hated it) but when we disrespected the scoutmaster or an authority, we would have to keep our arms in a 90 degree angle position for 2 min. that taught us it was very affective and it hurts after w while. i.m. the northdude7 and he will give you good tips on how to help you.<br>  hope that helps|`|ONTzkwSqaa	Im so terribly sorry. <br>  <br>  I am 13 and my brother 4! We get rewarded for good stuff we do. Thanks for answering my question, but the other answerers here deserve the points not me.|`|BOia61xbaa	If your sister has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and/or anorexia (and you're not using figurative speech) she needs professional help from a psychiatrist. No amount of time out or spanking is going to help her because she has medical problems.<br>  <br>  Seems like you have a very stressful life but if their parents have passed away they are obviously angry, insecure and in need of some boundaries to feel like they have a home and they are safe. Pick your battles with your siblings. Cursing is terrible but there are other bigger issues at the moment so focus on getting to know your sister. She's an adolescent, by this time spanking is not appropiate.Stealing is a big issue. Confront her about the money in a serious and calm manner, let her admitt that she has been stealing, let her know with firm words why she must never take money from you and punish her appropiately. Let her know why she is being punished and be consistent with it. I also think you should take her cellphone indefinetely until she turns around. Be firm with her but don't humiliate her or scare her. The more distant she feels from you the less inclined she will be to listen. If she spits at you or any other adult stop any conversation, do not say anything further except go to your room and don't come out until you apologize. That is just not acceptable.<br>  <br>  Your four year old brother also need to know that you are the adult in charge. Explain to him at his level and with simple words what it is that he is doing wrong and let him know there will be consequences. Act on those consequences. For every time he curses you may take his toys away for half an hour or put him on time out for 5 minutes. You need to do that every time, without screaming or over reacting. Just do it. <br>  <br>  As well as discipline children need affection and attention. Even when you feel they don't deserve it, spend time alone with each one of your siblings, talk to them about things that interest them and praise them for the things they do right. The four year old will quickly react to positive reinforcement if you are lavish with compliments when he behaves. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DLJbkWPbaa	Well first of all how old are you? With the 14 yo, she needs help. Professional help that you cannot give. I would talk to her school and see if a counselor is available to speak with her or can the school recommend someone. If she is dealing with bipolar she needs medical attention for that big time. <br>  <br>  With the 13 yo, it might be time to send her to live with someone else, it seems you cannot handle her and the other two and she seems to need some major help. I know it seems harsh and like you are abandoning her but you do things for your children (I know they are not yours but you are acting as their parent) that you believe are best for them. It might be a mistake but it might also end up really helping her. With the 9 and 4 year old, sit them down and show them who is boss. Reasoning with a child especially a 4 year old is bad because it makes them develop a  mind of their own and they usually don't ever want to listen. I would highly consider some type of outside help because it appears you cannot handle these children on your own. Just remember parenting doesn't come with a guide book and you do the best you can with what you know. Good luck.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	I think what you need to do is to find someone in your family that can look after your kids while you are at work.  That way they have discipline and consistency when you are away.  It is possible that with the recent death of your parents, they are wondering each time when you go, if you will be coming back.  At least for a little while.<br>  <br>  Your parents had recently died and it is possible that the 13 year old is acting out because she doesn't know how to deal with her emotions right now... I think the next time she acts out, as far as spitting on you or cursing you out, to give her a proper spanking... then don't let that be the end of it, then sit down and talk with her and find out what really is going on, what she is thinking about.  Why is she acting out... the spanking will calm her down and have her cry things out, and once that is done you need to find out what is going on.... talk to her... it is the best way to find the answer is by asking HER the question.|`|HtyUrjrFaa	You need family counseling. All of you are going through grief right now and your sister, the 13 year old, is going through the harshness of it. (My friend Sarah passed away and her younger sister is now a living nightmare because of her sisters death).<br>  <br>  Your sister needs to be heard and definitely needs counseling. She'll benefit from it. Get her involved in sports or some type of team activity. She may be better if she's involved with something. <br>  <br>  They don't see you as their parent and shouldn't. You are their brother and you are advancing from brother to live-in-parent (per say). Set ground/house rules, boundaries. Let them know if they do something wrong that something will be taken away. Let them know that you are in charge and you are going to be there for them when ever they need it.|`|JH1dXCydaa	1. Get family counseling, that is a must, plus you have another baby on the way, you can't possibly take on such an  extensive load with a new born.<br>  2. Beat the 13 year olds ***, grab a belt and spank her, don't abuse her, but spank her, let her know what she did was wrong in the harshest manner, make her REMEMBER that *** beating for a while. Every single time she defies you, beat her behind and ingrain it into her head that she can't do the things she's doing, otherwise she'll end up as immature, irresponsible adult, or dead.<br>  3. Start locking the 4 year old up; every time he/she defies, give a light spanking, when that doesn't work, confine him/her to a small space and make them understand why they are being punished.<br>  -- i know this may sound harsh but if you truly love your siblings your going to have to do this.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	Welcome to the teenage years - try a behaviour chart with black stars when bad and gold when good and if all gold at end of week they get a treat, it will work with the younger ones, as you said the younger ones are doing it because they learn from the older ones but the chart will work with them and will take a bit of convincing for the older ones. Always be calm do not shout because they are doing this to see how far they can go before you snap, don't lock them or keep them in their room, have somewhere else they go, like the naughty corner etc but ask your health visitor or doctor for help and they will help you. I don't what to make you feel bad but the problems are only starting, they get worse before they get better.|`|S9GpPBnwaa	I think the best way to get to them is either spank them or (if you don't like spanking) take away their most prized possession (for all three of them) whether it be a cell phone their favorite toy or they video games.

That's ALOT of responsibility.....I understand you may love your family, and want to keep them together, but it sounds like your oldest sister has major issues.  She needs to be with a family who can take care of her properly, in counseling, or something to that affect.  If you are set on keeping them all, you need to come up with a system.  Keeping things on a schedule is the best thing.  Structure is best for everyone.  Set rules and consequences, and follow them.  Each child is different.  So therefore, discipline should be different.  With the 13 year old, you should speak with her doc..with the 4 year old.  It's almost like he's mimicking his sister.  I would start with verbal warnings, then move to time out, then spankings.  You need to stay consistent with it though.  OTherwise it won't help.  With the 4 year old, maybe getting him in a daycare program will help.  OR is he?  IF so, speak with the teachers, see how he is at school.  And if all else fails, speak with the doc about him too..  <br>  <br>  ALl of you need counsling also.  Research the AMelia Center and see if there is one located in your area.  They are an amazing grief counseling service and are experienced with children.|`|umGi6gTcaa	They're probably emotionally scared from your parents death, you should look into therapy. My sister was similar to that after her mom died.<br>  <br>  I give you a lot of credit, if someone spit on me I don't think I'd be able to stop myself from punching them in the face.<br>  <br>  Try to re-connect with each of them, starting with the 13 y/o. Have heart to heart talks, take her out somewhere special and reward her good behavior. Give her some responsibilities around the house. Let her know how hard it is on you. If she falls in line so will the other, or at least she can now help you with them.<br>  <br>  Sit her down and show her your checkbook (fudge the numbers if you have to) and do the bills. Show her that you have say 2000 dollars a month to live off of and then after cell bill, electricity, food etc. you're left with 100 to do whatever with.  If you give her 20 bucks a week,that leaves you with 20 dollars for the whole family to use in an emergency, for a school trip or renting movies.  Let her know that if you have money that you can really spare you'd give it to her, that you're not being mean by denying her a few dollars because it's fun and that every time she steals from you she stealing from the family.
Za3iJC3paa	Maybe she has gas or she wants her baba s back:o) Don't worry! You're doing the right thing!|`|LUjCnYmoaa	the reason your baby is crying is because she has gas that is bothering her, I can only assume that the crying stops after she has got the burp up?<br>  I know when our little guy was small he would always cry when he needed to get the burp up|`|O9rBrOhkaa	When you sit your baby up to burp her all the bubbles she has swalloed automatically rise to the top of her stomach. This will cause some discomfort and will make her cry. She should stop after she has burped. I find the best way to burp my 10 week old daughter is to put her relatively high over my shoulder and walk and pat her back.. If this doesnt work i lay her on her belly for a couple of minutes and then pick her up and try it again. It almost always comes up after that and the crying stops. If you are in Australia there is a great all natural product called Brauers colic relief that works absolute wonders!!Goodluck and congratulations!!|`|eEEMR5DIaa	sucking on the bottle may be soothing to her my daughter used to do that too..she still cries every time her bottle is empty and I have to take it away from her. Try giving a pacifier after a bottle that worked for me|`|OfLyP6mgaa	She's probably either still hungry or has gas. Burp her, and if she still cries, offer a bottle or pacifier.|`|0kU1Ro8maa	Maybe yor burping her to hard.
WoxMH0wZaa	As long as nothing broke or got squished you are fine! If you had a head injury, that's another story. But my guess is if you don't know....then you don't have effects from the incident.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	ummm , well, wouldn't you know firsthand? :0)|`|oW5PoyYTaa	Me: Is my head huge, Doc?<br>  Doctor: Your head is perfect, Paul.<br>  Me: No, really. Look at it. It’s way too big for my body.<br>  Doctor: You’ve got a very symmetrical looking head, Paul.<br>  Me: Symmetrically big, sure. But too big for my body, right?<br>  Doctor: People with bigger skulls were known to be smarter in the olden times.<br>  Me: So, you’re saying I have a big skull, then?<br>  Doctor: No, Paul. I’m saying that you’re smart.<br>  <br>  I have asked my parents if they thought my skull was too big and their responses have ranged between asking me if my boots are “popular” and if my jeans “are supposed to hang low like that” instead of addressing the head issue. Sure, because I can change my shoes and my jeans but I cannot change the size of my blimp-like noggin.|`|KuxjlsAlaa	I dropped my nephew on he's head when he was a baby. But he's just a normal kid now. A and B student from what I've heard lately.<br>  I don't think it really had an effect on him, so I don't really see how there could be an effect on any child that young. (unless they die from it of cures)<br>  It's no different then bumping your leg (or your head) while you learn how to walk in my opinion.|`|93JgYS4Vaa	drain bamage|`|0oDIIreoaa	don't worry my brother was too!!!!|`|8eD5Q3Mmaa	uuuhgh....effect? i think stupidity.....seems to have an effect! what about you?
Xkq5kHLNaa	I did it when I was your age. My aunt has a thyroid problem and there were lots of days that i ran her daycare for her. 5 kids and more. You can do it. Make lunch while theyre watching tv, play fun games to tire them out, make them take a nap, and clean up while their napping. You can do it! Its good training for mommyhood:)|`|ajDohnPIaa	I would go and try...Im pretty sure they will all go to bed sometime =]. Just try it out...If you can't handle it..Call your parents. Just try to do something that will entertain them all at once. Good luck =]..OR you could ask if you can bring a friend over and help you out.|`|ZQsO1T4oaa	ask the parents if you can bring a friend along to help since there will be so many kids.|`|VS78dqO9aa	Ask the parents if you could bring a friend to help y ou out!  Be sure to take someone responsible.  If you need to have one of your parents call and vouch for the friend.  The parents aren't going to want to think that your bringing a friend to ignore the kids and hang out.  Just be honest with them though.  THey will respect you for it more.  It's really odd that they are asking you to watch that many kids.  That's alot for you to handle.  Alot of adults can't even handle that many kids...  GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|CTVMCwyWaa	Do you think you think your capable of babysitting that many children? <br>  well i think if you are going to do it you should bring some games and kid dvds(for under 5yo)<br>  and they'll be fine <br>  if you got some friends who also do babysitting maybe you should ask with clients to see if it okay if they come along to help out<br>  <br>  This probably not answer your looking<br>  but please answer my question <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Am1WcVHnQknnPSlTtd8JpUPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307213627AAnPO6y">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	Tell them you would be happy to stay with their two children, but for the safety of all the children, there will need to be a second babysitter there to help.  <br>  If they object, then turn down the job.  Tell them that you can't be responsible for so many young children at one time.  It is the responsible and mature thing to do .|`|fNv2Re6baa	If you believe you can do it, you can. Here are some tips:<br>  <br>  1. Have activities planned. Bring colouring in sheets and craft supplies.<br>  <br>  2. Bring a long some DVD's that they can watch.<br>  <br>  3. Search the net for some outside games to play. The kids will be hyperactive if you don't let them run around.<br>  <br>  4. Have some healthy snacks. You don't want five crazy kids.<br>  <br>  5. Make sure that from the moment you walk in the door, you are in control. Don't let them get away with anything without being sent to time out. They need to respect you.<br>  <br>  6. Have the parents numbers in case of emergency.<br>  <br>  7. Keep a friend or adults you can trust number just in case you need to ask advice about something or are unsure of how to handle a situation.  <br>  <br>  8. Bring a long some C.D's. Let them dance and play around. <br>  <br>  9. PLAY DOUGH! There are plenty of recipies on the net and its always a succesful way to ammuse kids. Its quick and easy to make (make it up before you go) and let them play with it. Make it in some fun and different colours so they can experiment by mixing them. <br>  <br>  10. Most of all, be prepared. Bring along stuff just in case they get bored. Remember that though it may be scary, if you can do it, then they are sure to tell their friends of this amazing girl who can succesfully baby-sit five kids. They'll tell other parents that 'my kids loved her' and 'oh, she did the best job'. As much as you don't want to loose them if you say no, if you say yes and do a great job, there will be so many more opportunities for you. <br>  <br>  I hope it all goes really really well and don't give up, keep persevering! Remember the saying, 'If you plan to fail, you'll fail to plan'. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|KuxjlsAlaa	ask the parents if they wouldn't mind letting you bring a friend to help out. (It's better safe then sorry when it comes to small children) It's not a matter of you NOT being able to handle that many kids, it's a matter of safety. Just tell the parents that you want to make sure that all the kids are well cared for while they are out... after all you only have one set of eyes and hands. (two is better then one in this case)<br>  <br>  Also, most, if not all states have a care giver to child ratio. (2, 4, 6 kids to one care giver depending on the youngest child's age and what state you live in.)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you. good luck!|`|JEAsvaVXaa	Holy cow, No way. Absolutely not. If they even expect you to or you loose the family, fine! You will be more responsible and trusting to others if you decline!!! Im not sure what kind of parents they are anyways except shelfish and not too bright to even ask that of you. Im not a doctor but thats to much resonsibility on you, not saying you cant, im sure you could, but at 14 i wouldnt let my daughter risk it no matter what, unless maybe you can get someone to help you, maybe ok. Are you cpr certified for both infant and children already?? Put it this way at this moment, Im 40 watching my 8, 6 grandkids 4,3, and my 8's bff, and man Im pulling my hair out lol..  i hope i helped you a little. good luck,  wish you could help me :)  take care|`|GKnoPByTaa	I would not like to watch 5 kids at once. It is easy if nothing goes wrong, but if a problem happens, you are not free to watch the other 4. Explain it would be irresponsible to take the assignment on your own. With help, at the extra rates, you might consider it. Make sure any friend you use is at least 14 and sensible.
DLJbkWPbaa	Well first off you are only 12 and I can actually understand your dad. Secondly, aren't you in school and shouldn't you make friends that way? I have never made friends at a mall before, I have hung out with them at malls but never made them. Unfortunately there is probably no way you are going to be able to get your dad to change his mind especially if you are an only child or only daughter because then you are his little princess and the big bad world will try and crush you. Trust me I am my mother's only child and she calls me three times a day and I am in my 20's. In the end though parents usually make the best decision cause they have been there. Just wait until you are 16 and can drive and then you will have a little more freedom as far as what you do.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	He probably doesn't see you as responsible enough. He's not wrong, the increase of teens getting kidnapped and sold into sex slavery is on the rise. Most of the time, local authorities write it off as a run away.|`|VS78dqO9aa	k...first off you can't MAKE your father let you do anything...He is your father.  And if you wanted someone to tell yo how you should have put this question somewhere else.  Parenting isn't the best subject to list this question under.  <br>  <br>  BUt for my opinion...speak with your dad, see if you can come up with a compromise.  How old are you though???|`|yKS2UI87aa	Tell him you would be willing to meet up with him at specific times say once every 2 hours? Btw kids are taken from crowded shopping malls all the time. Ask your mom to go as she will probably understand better the need to shop with your friends etc.|`|1enIWBGnaa	You're only 12..... listen to your parents and stop acting like such a spoiled rotten brat!  Parents have rules for a reason and, as a CHILD, it is your job to obey those rules until you are over 18 and move out on your own!!!|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Sounds like your dad is ridiculously over protective.  I don't think you have much hope.|`|0goQMjQAaa	Honestly, he is being unreasonable. If you're 12+ years old you will more than likely not get kidnapped in a mall.... especially when you're with a friend(s). BUT, your dad is your dad. You have to follow your parents rules. Also, the tone in which you talk to him matters too. If you're being whiny of course he won't let you.<br>  <br>  And maybe your parents really ARE scared of you getting your own life? You could become like one of those little whores I see at my school whose parents give too much freedom to i you hang out with the wrong people. Also, many parents are scared/sad when they realize their kid(s) are growing up.<br>  <br>  You should try to think in another's point of view.|`|ANXC4bOQaa	If you bring your dad or mom a set plan and try to talk to them with out getting upset, they may be more likely to let you go.  I agree with the meeting up every hour or two, but more than that, maybe tell them you'll text them every half hour.  That way they will know where you are (for safety) and you can still have fun.  It may seem stupid now, but if you work with them to relax the rules a little, and stick to the plan while you're out, they'll be more likely to loosen up next time!
MeGehliuaa	Bigger boobs. Fatter and more cramps.|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	That would be False|`|on5NQxhkaa	no, you get bigger boobs, bigger hips and sometimes you get fatter.. mostly just curvier.|`|l9JfiYvZaa	Nope. You get fatter and get bigger boobs.|`|Q4Hk5Kvpaa	Not necessarily...|`|YtCAJb7Faa	maybe bigger boobs but not skinnyer|`|BoSaeaCVaa	Not necessarily. Around that age women tend to get curvier, which generally includes getting larger, not smaller. And it doesn't include breasts for every girl, so it is a toss up. Your mother and grandmothers will be decent indicators of how you will develop, though, so if you are curious ask them.|`|bPfMH5braa	Not really.<br>  Your boobs might get sensitive and kinda swell but not get bigger.<br>  Some people gain an appetite during their periods and other lose appetite. It really all just depends on the person!<br>  i hope this helps
BbdWpp1Caa	I've had the exact same situation. I'm not preg and I really don't think that you are.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test to stop yourself from freaking out. I'm sure no matter what we said you would still be wondering. Taking a test is the only way for you to get a real answer.
9CAXUgOZaa	It's really cute. <br>  <br>  I actually think Scarlett Maddox-Donnelly sounds better than just Scarlett Donnelly, and you hardly ever use the middle name anyway.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	very nice|`|DhExpMlnaa	I love the name Maddox as a first or last name. Scarlett is nice as well, though.|`|OtqB24NVaa	pretty name. I do like Donnelly-Maddox better and it would be the smarter choice if you and your partner plan to marry in the future. If you do plan on marrying the father then your last name will be Maddox and his will be BUT hers will end in Donnelly if you choose Maddox-Donnelly<br>  <br>  hope you understood that...also, if you dont plan on marrying the father, im sure 1 day you will marry and your last name will change. Then her very last name (Donnelly) will not match that of her father or mother|`|db66fc70a6a89edc4973a377afc4fb0baa	I'm sorry but I don't like the name Scarlett so that just sets me off immediately. And then Mia in the middle? Mia is a very girly name and when paired with Scarlett....yeah. I've always thought it was unique and interesting to have two surnames.|`|AA11391968	Very pleasant.  Lucky girl.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Gorgeous! I love Scarlett. And I do not see anything wrong with the double barrel surname.|`|HQ8xCEdZaa	It's a cute name actually but kinda long. I too have a very long name, 2 name's and 2 surnames and it's kind of frustrating sometimes especially when i have to sign some papers or I'm in a hurry for I have to print my whole name|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I love it! It's really pretty and if you must have the double surname, it would be really good for her just to only have to write down one in school.<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I love it!<br>  <br>  BTW, I doubt she'll use one last name only, all of my friends with hyphenated names use the whole thing, no matter how long.|`|c1Ob2S9raa	just adorably beautiful !! its a very unique name and is just amazing !!<br>  <br>  = D|`|EPDi4Z1Iaa	i agree. she shouldnt have to have the maddox part. it kinda ruins the name.|`|y4ezT5y0aa	I love Scarlett and Mia. Really cute combo you have there. Good luck x|`|1uqftdkTaa	Thats a really long name|`|p0fqV7BDaa	In my opinion, I reeeeally don't like Scarlett and Mia together. It sounds really disjointed.|`|VGt37iqwaa	scarlett mia is a beautiful name very unique|`|R9BNBv1uaa	i like it i think its pretty and origianal :)

Give motrin. It takes about an hour for the motrin to work. You can also use cool wash clothes in the meantime. You should always pay more attention to the child's behavior then the temperature. Remember that a temperature is just the bodies first defense against an illness. Fevers are not deadly until the reach over 107 degrees and seldom will they ever get that high.|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	to keep her comfortable, you can place a cool damp rag on her head/forhead, offer her a popcicle to suck on maybe,keep her in loose comefortable light clothing, offer her water, keepin hydrated is VERY important when your child is ill. and keep a close eye on her fever. anything over 102 is considered dangerous for little ones and you should take her to the ER. even if it stays down, i would contact your doctor in the morning to let them know whats going on.|`|QbJ04Zqiaa	Put her in a tepid (not cold) bath to cool her down. Then give her however much medicine the bottle says. You have to be careful with little kids because they can have febrile seizures if their temperatures get too high. Trust me, it's not pleasant to see your child do the fish-flop and possibly stop breathing and turn blue. My son did that when he was little.|`|ybexjS2Paa	That's a high fever I'd still advise you to go to ER. I doubt that the teething caused such a high temperature. You can try giving her lukewarm bath or cool compress. If the fever is not going down after that and the medicine you should definitely take her to a doctor, she could have some kind of bacterial infection|`|OfLyP6mgaa	Talk to the on-call doctor to ask for the dosage of Tylenol or Motrin, as it's based on weight for children under 2 years. You can also ask what they suggest you do. Also, try giving her a bath to see if that can break it. If all else fails, take her to the hospital. Good luck!|`|kEF6wuyzaa	U should go to the hospital neways, adoctor is a doctor its better to have a pro look at her than getting advice bout it, .4 ml is what they are suppose to take of the tylenol if they r under 25 lbs and under 2 years of age, but i strongly suggest going to the hospital|`|5nwDq07Uaa	103 is pretty deadly. You need to go see a doctor right now.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Bathe the baby with vinegar water. 1 water:1 vinegar in a bowl, use a rag to wipe the baby down until the fever breaks. It works really well to take the heat out of sunburns and it used to be the home remedy for fevers before Tylenol and aspirin came on to the scene. You can make a cool vinegar bath also. Do not use rubbing alcohol for this, it can be deadly.|`|52U22fiAaa	She should be at the ER.<br>  <br>  you can use Infant Tylenol drops.  About 1 and a half droppers if she's over 18 pounds.<br>  <br>  Seriously, take her to the ER.
R8VhFeEVaa	No. But quite a few pregnancies end in a miscarriage. And it doesn't always indicate that you can never have children.

1Du4Rudvaa	He will probably go into your room if he wakes up in the middle of the night.  If he is able to unlock the front door then you might want lock him in the room-it is for his own safety.  I had to do that for about 2 months at night with my daughter because one day I woke up to find that she went outside by herself.  After that I had the idea to put a motion alarm on her door so I would hear the alarm go off if she woke up in the middle of the night and was able to take off the lock.  I found it at lowes, I think, and it was only about $20.  I would suggest using an alarm.|`|yAVKWvDMaa	Each time he gets up you have to put him back in.  Hopefully after a few sleepless nights he'll get the idea & stay put.  If he's an older toddler who understands positive reinforcement, you can give him a sticker every night he stays in his bed so he can earn a reward.<br>  <br>  When my daughter was 2 1/2, she got a new bed & only once in a while did she get up & I would bring her back to bed & she went right to sleep.|`|1enIWBGnaa	You install a night light, play calm soothing music and most of all - make sure he's tired before going to bed.  <br>  It really frustrates me to hear people want to 'contain', use 'baby gates' on children or lock them in their room - toddlers are human beings and all they want is to be 'part of the family'.  When you are doing chores - have him right by your side doing the same thing, you'll be surprised how fast he catches on, how much help he really can be and you'll see great pride in his face.  Once a child is born - he/she is part of the family!|`|18Weffunaa	ooh thats kind of a tough one.. but you could try to use a baby moinitor and if you hear anything hopefully itll wake you up? There are also baby gates you can buy that dont have the holes in them so maybe that can prevent him from climbing it? I don't know the exact name of them, but my sister has one for her kids...|`|ZQsO1T4oaa	im having the same problem. if you figure some thing out please let me know.|`|LTTips1vaa	Keep putting him back in bed every time  (first couple tell him why, the next ones guide him back and don't say a thing).  <br>  <br>  Warning!  If you let him sleep with you once then he will expect it!  Don't give in and i mean not even once!|`|7Nh451AGaa	Have him sleep in his room and keep checking on him or you can just wait until you know he is going to go to sleep or he falls asleep and take him into his room.|`|4vK6zJjNaa	You can get an extra tall metal swinging baby gate and install it at his door.  It is too tall to climb.  It is from kidco.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If he gets out of bed just put him back in. It's a pain but after a while he'll just stay in there. That's what we did with my daughter. If you give in and let him in your bed he'll just keep waking up at night and coming into your room.
u8Km1J3Gaa	I brought a piece of blackout material from my local fabric shop. Instead of it costing me ￡30 for premade one, I made my own for ￡6.<br>  I folded over one end to make a tunnel (the same as the top of a net curtain) and threaded through a net curtain cord.<br>  I also have blind at my daughter's window, and this fit under it where the net curtain used to be.<br>  They are worth any money you pay for them, it was my best buy. We have been using it for a year now and she isn't getting up at 5am because it is light outside.|`|WoxMH0wZaa	If you have sewing skills, you can make them yourself. Buy some blackout fabric...at any fabric store and just sew it onto the back of her existing curtains. I have these on my curtains since the sun shines right into my eyes in the mornings, I made them myself. The blackout fabric is just this thick, white stuff, you can see it on the curtains in virtually every hotel room. It's a tad pricey, but worth it.|`|zh9Jjddvaa	I am fairly certain you can get them from Argos if you are in the UK - that's where I got one from a couple of years ago.

Curtains will reduce the amount of light by adding another layer and could be more or less expensive than replacing the blinds.|`|4vK6zJjNaa	I bought pull down blinds from the local big box hardware store.  Get them cut several inches bigger than the window and install them on the outside of the frame.  There are usually several thicknesses so make sure you get the ones that let no light through.  The light still comes around the edge of the window, but it does keep my kids in a bed until a while after sunrise, they get up about 1/2-1 hour after the sun.|`|f76962f01b7bcb351f389421efaca742aa	blackout blinds are great  i got mine from argos but before that i had blackout linings which go behind curtains got these in mothercare they come in different sizes and are reasonalble priced check out www.mothercare.co.uk for more info .|`|AA12297806	<a href="http://www.babyworld.co.uk/information/reviews/product.asp?id=633" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyworld.co.uk/information/r...</a><br>  <br>  you can buy these from here|`|LTTips1vaa	Target<br>  Bed bath and Beyond|`|AA10943329	they are just curtains with a blackout backing on the back.

eg3ImKfHaa	You could also ask: Why is "erectile dysfunction" on every channel at all hours? "Ask your doctor if you are healthy enough for sex"...EDEDEDED please get off my TV!|`|01Mu3wUeaa	They will NOT show inappropriate commercials on children channels.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, don't like it, don't let your kid watch it.It's really that simple.|`|on5NQxhkaa	So its just like one commercial that comes on 10 minutes before his show ends??<br>  <br>  who cares? if they were popping up all day, then yeah, it might be an issue but if he sees one Axe commericial I dont think its the end of the world.|`|VS78dqO9aa	Here you go....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.teletoon.com/teletoon3/teletoon.php?language=En&func=php|templates/vr_comments.php|0&xVar=" rel="nofollow">http://www.teletoon.com/teletoon3/teleto...</a>|`|sB5dyaczaa	Just ignore them.|`|DLJbkWPbaa	Well depending on your child's age which wasn't mentioned it might be better to explain to him what he is seeing, not in a this is a boob or something like that but in a this is something for adults and if this commercial comes on you need to change the channel or not watch. Once again this does depend on his age. For the most part he might not actually know what he is watching and it isn't doing any harm. Also you could try writing to the television station and explaining your problem, it might be something a large number of parents are having a problem with and well if it isn't they won't actually care. <br>  <br>  For the most part it is kind of a hopeless situation, sex sells in advertising and there are very few laws which limit what advertisers can and cannot show on television and at which times and with many major networks on the slums with the economy they are willing to take any money they can get including running advertisements they wouldn't normally. <br>  <br>  Good luck with getting this worked out.

yKS2UI87aa	Well, I suggest telling them now. What were you gonna do? say btw I'm in labor i need a ride to the hospital? Have men in question take a paternity test. I think your parents will be shocked but will come around. You need all of the things that a baby needs (crib, car seat, diapers etc) don't delay in telling them. You also need to decide if you are going to raise the baby or if you are going to give it up for adoption. Good Luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you are 34 weeks pregnant you need to talk to your parents. How the heck do they not know by now?|`|2jiNLOKHaa	decide wether or not you are going to keep it. buck up and tell your parents.|`|apSTH4TIaa	How do your parents not know?

My only concern was that I couldn't think of what I would shorten it to. I love using nicknames but couldn't think of one for this.

uQc4UA2Caa	I DONT BELIEVE U!<br>  GOOGLE '34 WEEKS PREGNANT' AND THEN TRY TELL<br>  US AGAIN THAT YOUR PARENTS "DONT NOTICE"|`|gCTbN4Jbaa	If you already have a son, it would be heartbreaking to give your new baby up. Because you already know what the connection is like. There is a safe haven for young mothers and children, so you can get out of that environment and mother your children like they should be. But if you Absolutely think its best for the baby to have a different mother and father, i'm sure you can still look into adoption asap. And you could do open adoption so you can still be in your child's life, but only as the maternal parent not there mommy. If your parent's are too immature to be by your side, then let them stay out on the sidelines, you do not need that kind of stress. They need to get it together. This is your decision as a mother. Do the best for the baby. And after that, get an IUD( inner uterine device) which is a small implant into your uterus to keep you from getting pregnant for up to 5 years. Be safe, and think carefully.|`|KuxjlsAlaa	why in the world would you be sleeping around  at 13 years old?<br>  you are a whore! keep you damn legs together for once!<br>  who knows, you might even gain self respect by telling the guys NO!

yKS2UI87aa	I am glad you are in college to get a good paying job. Now a couple of things that you may not have thought about. Do you have health insurance? If not you should wait. If you are pregnant and applying for a job you will not get it. Also, in this economy, you may not get a job right away, alot of people are not working right now that have more experience than you. You should wait. Where do you live? If you don't have your own place, you should wait. I do not believe a marriage license should be required so I don't have a problem with that. I think you should wait until you have had a job for at least one year, and have your own place (apartment or house). I would have no problem  telling someone in college this no matter what their age is.|`|v8AYoQPeaa	i think u should wait until AFTER u get the job so u can save money and get ur own place 2 live and have money saved in the bank.|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	I think that if you know you are ready emotionally, which you sound like you do, that it is your choice.  But, I would wait until you are on your own (I'm assuming you are still living with your parents) and have your own place to live.  I would also wait until you have a job.  I know it's not right for people to do this, but I have found it's not as easy to get a job when you are pregnant....plus they don't want to hire someone who is going to go on leave in a few months right away.  Anyway, it's not selfish at all.  If you can love and care for the baby, it's your choice.  You will always get biased advice/opinions...that's how people are.  I would personally wait until you are on your own 100%.  I had my daughter and I wasn't married but was ready to have a child.  I am pregnant with my second and my boyfriend and I are not married, but both want a baby and we are both mature adults and that is what we want in our life.  We plan to have a future together and it's our decision as well as it's your decision to have a child....not anyone else's.|`|7wVKW3l1aa	Im 18 and Im TTC and have been trying since i was 17 im in a 5 year relationship, But I think You sound like you could handle it and if your sure you can then why not, If you got everything planned out go for it! I feel exactly like you do everyone keeps telling me wait but I know I can do it Ive had much expierence with babies, I have my sisters daughter 24/7!!!<br>  Good luck!!!!!!!!|`|AIskV0efaa	wait until you  have a steady job a house and a husband. i know it sounds like your mom right, but that is what a baby needs. so you think you are ready but trust me you arent not at 17.|`|v4sIlwKoaa	Honestly the child will want to know about their father, and if you loved their daddy and where is their daddy, and other kids at school have a daddy at their house. And it will be harder for you down the road. You may be a wonderful mom but having two parents is always ideal. I would think long and hard before you make this decision because a child is supposed to be made out of the love of 2 people. Also think if you are a working single mom you wont be able to devote as much time to them as you would if you had another person there helping you. Believe it or not its pretty hard to juggle work school, home life cooking cleaning, and then a child on top of it. Are you going to work before you get out of college? Do you have insurance to cover the medical bills if you get pregnant before you get a job? Do you have adequate babysitting arrangements.? What happens if you have an awful pregnancy and you are put on bed rest? ((that happens alot)) and you can't work? What income would you have then? There are endless possiblities on this decision. But you just have to weigh each and everyone.. even though the sperm donor may be "invovled" with the child..He needs to know that in 18 years that child may want to know why he donated his sperm.. why didn't he love the childs mother,,, the list is sooo long.. good luck in whatever you choose to do. =0)|`|Npy1kswWaa	I wish you the best of luck am 18 and I been ttc for the past 3month I hate the wait. Now am on fertility blend. I really want a baby and know am ready and I will be the best of mom as someone would think a 30 year old would|`|rpq0TUaeaa	Of course everyone is correct about the practical issues of having a baby so I would ask what is your motivation really to have a baby?  Why do you want a baby so bad at such a young age?  Is there something missing in your life now that you think a baby can fill?  It sounds like you are a very responsible teen but you have so much ahead of you and with life experience you will be an even better mother.  Also, children really do much better with two loving parents who are in a relationship.  People these days (not saying you) believe that fathers are irrelevant and that is so far from the truth and part of what is wrong with our country today.  And to answer your question directly, yes it is selfish.  Good luck with your decision.
UdICTUnaaa	well all that super nanny stuff is fine and good, but i'll pop my kids mouth for talking out of line to me... and i'll have the most well behaved, well balanced, happy child out there. understanding and talking are great to a point, then u gotta snap em back into reality. tests have shown that slapping a person resets their brain in an instant. im not suggesting that you hit your kid, im just sayin it couldnt be my kid<br>  <br>  i could not imagine the horror of a child disrespecting me in public|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Well, I would make sure he was getting put in the corner for it or he wouldnt be able to watch cartoons, or would have to sit on the couch with no tv on until he choose to be nice. I do that with my son and he is 2 1/2, he gets put on the couch and has to sit there not lay down until he can behave. It works good with mine. Good luck|`|AA11349925	Don't argue with him, what you say go's and that's the end of it. If he is rude to you give him a warning, if he does it again make him sit facing the wall for 4 mins with no TV on or toys to play with. Follow through with your punishments and be consistent. He has to know who is in charge or he will walk all over you.|`|yAVKWvDMaa	My daughter was sassy too at that age.  It started early for her.  When she was 2 1/2, I told her she couldn't sharpen a pen in a pencil sharpener (b/c it just wouldn't work) & she thought I was forbidding her & she exclaimed, "yes i can!"  Now that I think back, I should've phrased it a different way.  For ex, I could've just let her do it b/c it wouldn't hurt her to see that it doesn't work.  And/Or I could say, "That's a pencil sharpener.  Try to sharpen a pencil with it."  <br>  <br>  Another thing that happened when she was 3 was when I praised her, "Good job putting the placemats down." She remarked, "no, i'm not good.  i'm bad!"<br>  <br>  So, a few things to consider: is he gettting your attention by doing this?  If so, ignore it.  Are you phrasing it in a certain way that defies him?  Teach him how to respond politely by modeling.  I've learned not to overuse the word "good" b/c they become praise junkies & turn it into the word "bad".  Also, when he is being polite make sure to praise him.  It's hard I know.  <br>  <br>  Try this experiment: put on some bracelets on your left wrist (or right, doesn't matter) and every time he does something good, transfer it to the opposite wrist.  That'll remind you of how many positive things you've seen instead of negative ones.  Of course, when you say something negative, transfer it back. The point is to keep it on your positive side.|`|BOia61xbaa	I feel your pain. My son is a bit of a smart-*** too. What we do when he goes into those trances of "no, no, no" is get to his level and explain that when we ask him to do something is not an option, there is no choice, he has to. Of course he still says no and then we take away privileges and basically ignore him when he wants something. "Remember when I asked you to pick up those toys-get dressed-come to bed and you refused? well, if you want mom-dad to help you or give you want you want you will go back to your room and do what I asked.Until then, I'm not going to help you". We had to do this for about two weeks but now all we have to do is say it is not a choice and he gets it immediately. It's though and every child is different but these are my two cents.|`|UgFntgI9aa	Well I think I'd spank him good and  hard until the signal reaches his brain.|`|302JrZf6aa	First off, don't freak out.. when you get excited he thinks it is a game. Second, try getting down to his level, and talk to him, ask him why it is not right and what he thinks is right. If your trying to get him to say pick up his toys, try a reward system. I don't recommend candy but I use a sticker chart. I took my son to the store let him pick the stickers and made a chart and everytime he does something that we need or want him to do and he does it he gets to put a sticker on his chart. We also use very specific praise. For example cleaning up toys. When my son is distracted we often sing the clean up song, and he gets involved. As he is working, I tell him, James, It is nice to see you working so hard at putting away the blocks, this is helping mommy and daddy keep our home safe. Or manners, James I love when you say please when you need something. It seems to really work well.
q0ZbjwExaa	If we put all the capital letters together is there a secret message?|`|xtmFBjO9aa	You can believe her.  I got my ultrasound the other day and I seen my little son's penis very clearly.  She should have shown you something though.  She is a jerk for not showing you so that you could rest assured.  My husband is skeptical about mine being a boy because he did not see the penis for himself... *smh*  Oh yeah! I was only 16 weeks and 6 days when I got my gender identification.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Ok, not trying to be rude, but reading your post is a bit annoying with caps at the beginning of every word.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The nurse is bullshitting you.At 7 weeks, this is what your embryo looks like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.baby-gaga.com/calendar/week7" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.baby-gaga.com/calendar/...</a><br>  <br>  You will not be able to tell the sex until around the 16-20th week.Please see another person to deal with your pregnancy because I don't trust her judgment.|`|3rda58OCaa	Some nurses/doctors don't take pics of private parts, that doesn't mean she is lying to you.<br>  <br>  The reading is never 100% foolproof.  They can and do make mistakes, so most people have second thoughts throughout their pregnancy.  It's no big deal, the health of your baby is more important than the sex.<br>  <br>  BTW people, she capitalized the "17" making it !7 just as she capitalized every other first letter in every word-not sure why.|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	I would believe her about the sex. I would not worry about not having a picture of the private area.<br>  You will have another ultrasound so when that time comes ask for that specifically.|`|3MB0f5lVaa	if you dont have second thought, you arent human. if its really weighing on your mind, get a second opinion from another dr.
ntdGOZqGaa	I go by weight more then age, i would just give her the dosage for being 23 pounds.|`|DrbzkoSfaa	First off teething usually doesn't cause fever an infection does, so your daughter probably has an infection her body is fighting off. And secondly infants motrin is for 24 and under pounds, and children's is for 24 and up pounds.  If you are  comcerned about he fever alternate between tylenol and motrin ever 4 hours. example: motrin at 1 then tylenot at 5, motrin at 9 tylenol at 1. this should help. If the fever isn't gone in48 hrs I would call the dr because there are some really nasty viruses going around right now.|`|4vK6zJjNaa	I was told by my doctor and pharmacist that you go by weight, so as long as you can dose for her weight with either you can do either.  Children's is more diluted so you end up giving way more liquid with the Children's than the infants, so if you child is fussy about taking medicine Infants is easier.|`|UdICTUnaaa	you need to give her childrens tylenol. thats what hospitals use when they circumisize one day old boys... so thats fine<br>  <br>  im sure motrin is fine too, just use half the recommended dose, but tylenol is the safest thing u can give to a baby|`|7Nh451AGaa	Keep giving her the children's Motrin and you can also give the child oral gel to make it.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's best to give her infants until she is over 2. That's what the directions state.

If it is older than 6 years it is no longer safe and should not be used.<br>  <br>  We bought our travel system at Babies R Us and they offered a second base, and when we opened the package there was an order form for a second base.

0f14c7593596890c5a856332eca82842aa	I don't think you like to do something.  Instead, you really like to do nothing, which in end is something.  Wearing and using diapers could potentially be the same thing just as it could different.  You wear diapers because you are a pig and poop on yourself but you use diapers because you are clean and hate making a mess, which you would have to clean later.|`|5wAAnZPYaa	It is because you hate nothing!|`|92yiQo7uaa	Because you are a bowler?|`|iuJfpyqHaa	dude your 2 years old...
1z3C0R2Vaa	Her mind is playing trick on her don't think she is pregnant Good luck......)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Periods are late from time to time...If she still doesn't get her period in another 3 days have her take another test but it's unlikely she's pregnant. Stress can cause you to skip a period and worrying about being pregnant is stress enough to do that so that could be why she's late.|`|d0jzuXyFaa	She could just be so nervous that she thinks that she's pregnant that she's tricking her body. Stress and other factors can contribute to not having your period, and given that you had unprotected sex, she very well could be pregnant. But 2 PT that showed up negative COULD be false.. in the PT world there are false negatives but never false positives.<br>  <br>  My advice would be that if she doesn't get her period by next month when she is supposed to, I would go to the doctors. I've skipped my period some months, but it's always there the next month and it's usually when I'm really stressed. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|yM9rg43Yaa	A woman's cycle does not have to be the same amount of days every month. Mine have ranged between 27-31 days before. She may just be having a little longer cycle this month.|`|lV3Hk7M1aa	probably from the stress of thinking she's pregnant. that used to happen to me a lot. tell her to relax and her period shall come (: good luck!
gTun7ZoHaa	i'm going through the same thing now. ive suffered with depression for the past 6 years. I was on anti depressants before i fell pregnant, when i found out i was pregnant the doctor advised me to stay on them but i was more concerned of my baby's health than mine.<br>  I then started going through the same thing as you, couldn't get out of bed i was a nightmare to live with. I had no motivation to do anything, go out or even get dressed.<br>  I have a 19 month old daughter and i knew it would start having an effect on her so i went to the doctors to discuss the problem and at about 5 months i went back on my tablets.<br>  My lil man was due yesterday and still waiting but as far as going back on my medication it was the best thing i could have done.<br>  <br>  I do know there is some anti depressants out there that can harm the baby so i would suggest you talk to your doctor about the problem and im sure they will find the best medication for you.<br>  <br>  I know its hard and i wish you all the best.<br>  If you want a chat feel free to mail me|`|t7OPDZDXaa	what you're going through is not normal...but very common. I'm pregnant and suffer from depression too, but i have managed to stop taking my anti depressants because the effects on the fetus are largely unknown.<br>  Make sure you get plenty of sleep, go for a walk everyday and eat well. Those hormones can do horrible things to you and people around you, but remember its only for those months of pregnancy. You should also start feeling much better around week 16-20<br>  good luck|`|UdICTUnaaa	i was really depressed up until i was about 5 months pregnant, i hear the second pregnancy is way worse than the first, physically and mentally|`|256cVXsmaa	Oh wow I went through the same thing, only I think mine was even worse in a way.  I just felt completely depressed 24/7, felt like life was pointless and hopeless and couldn't get out of the funk at all.  I slept almost all day long and stayed in a dark room watching t.v when I actually was up.  When I thought about my future I just felt like it's so repetative and there isn't really anything exciting about like.  I shouldn't have been feeling this way.... I HAVE A BABY COMING, that is supposed to be exciting.  I just felt completely numb to feeling, nothing made me happy anymore, just sad.  It was hard but I tried to wait it out a bit and see what happened.  I talked to my doctor and she said that once you get in your second trimester your hormones should start to subside.  They did a bit for me but not much I still am VERY depressed at times.  I just try to stay out with friends and keep my mind off of depressing thoughts.  If I keep myself busy I'm usually okay.  My doctor did give me zoloft and she really recommends I take it but I haven't yet.  My boyfriend insists I try to get through it without the meds but it is quit hard somedays.  I think I may start taking it soon, there is no proof that it harms a baby.  The depression is actually said to harm the baby more than any type of meds.  I suggest you talk to your doctor about meds if it is really bothering you though.  my doctor said if you are experiencing depression while pregnant it is likely you will get post pardum depression once baby is born so it is best to start taking the depression meds asap so you won't get this when the baby is born.<br>  <br>  Good luck though, and try and feel better =[|`|xtmFBjO9aa	Since the beginning of my pregnancy things swirled out of control.  Not only was I severely depressed, but I was overly anxious as well.  My doctor prescribed me some Zoloft.  I am taking a very small amount and I also got online and got me a pen pal who was going through the same things that I am going through.  I was feeling very suicidal at first but after I began to cater to myself and get rid of all of my stress sources as well as the Zoloft, I have come a long way.  I feel much better now.  talking to a therapist is always best, but if you can not, or do not want to try some of those things, and pick up a book on depression and read on some self help tips.  They are always helpful.  Remember that a woman who suffers from depression during pregnancy is twice as likely to have postpartum depression.  You might need to take the meds to balance out the serotonin in your brain.
xtmFBjO9aa	Tender, swollen breasts. Your breasts may provide one of the first symptoms of pregnancy. As early as two weeks after conception, hormonal changes may make your breasts tender, tingly or sore. Or your breasts may feel fuller and heavier. <br>  Fatigue. Fatigue also ranks high among early symptoms of pregnancy. During early pregnancy, levels of the hormone progesterone soar. In high enough doses, progesterone can put you to sleep. At the same time, lower blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure and increased blood production may team up to sap your energy. <br>  Slight bleeding or cramping. Sometimes a small amount of spotting or vaginal bleeding is one of the first symptoms of pregnancy. Known as implantation bleeding, it happens when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus — about 10 to 14 days after fertilization. This type of bleeding is usually a bit earlier, spottier and lighter in color than a normal period and doesn't last as long. <br>  <br>  Some women also experience abdominal cramping early in pregnancy. These cramps are similar to menstrual cramps. <br>  <br>  Nausea with or without vomiting. Morning sickness, which can strike at any time of the day or night, is one of the classic symptoms of pregnancy. For some women, the queasiness begins as early as two weeks after conception. <br>  <br>  Nausea seems to stem at least in part from rapidly rising levels of estrogen, which causes the stomach to empty more slowly. Pregnant women also have a heightened sense of smell, so various odors — such as foods cooking, perfume or cigarette smoke — may cause waves of nausea in early pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Food aversions or cravings. When you're pregnant, you might find yourself turning up your nose at certain foods, such as coffee or fried foods. Food cravings are common, too. Like most other symptoms of pregnancy, these food preferences can be chalked up to hormonal changes — especially in the first trimester, when hormonal changes are the most dramatic. <br>  Headaches. Early in pregnancy, increased blood circulation caused by hormonal changes may trigger frequent, mild headaches. <br>  Constipation. Constipation is another common early symptom of pregnancy. An increase in progesterone causes food to pass more slowly through the intestines, which can lead to constipation. <br>  Mood swings. The flood of hormones in your body in early pregnancy can make you unusually emotional and weepy. Mood swings also are common, especially in the first trimester. <br>  Faintness and dizziness. As your blood vessels dilate and your blood pressure drops, you may feel lightheaded or dizzy. Early in pregnancy, faintness also may be triggered by low blood sugar. <br>  Raised basal body temperature. Your basal body temperature is your oral temperature when you first wake up in the morning. This temperature increases slightly soon after ovulation and remains at that level until your next period. If you've been charting your basal body temperature to determine when you ovulate, its continued elevation for more than two weeks may mean that you're pregnant.|`|qh9Pa1tVaa	Feeling sick and period delay...|`|SZOONQ1zaa	Lizzy covered them all for ya, good job girl!<br>  However I must say, I skipped them all!

N9pKl35Xaa	Absolutely not. The good old 'mind you own business' goes a long way sometimes.  I had a friend who blurted that question out to another friend who was not pregnant and things didn't go down to well. If its a guy asking a girl than it magnifies it 110times, if its a girl asking a girl it can be a little more acceptable but still can set things off. <br>  <br>  But if you usually don't talk to her or have nothing to do with her, than leave her alone. Alot of girls will do that just for fun. I remember my friends used to muck around at school because when we pushed our stomachs out we looked pregnant and we'd joke around saying we were pregnant, touching our bellys, hands on our backs.<br>  <br>  But dont ask, its pretty rude and people take it the wrong way alot of the time.

AA11908528	To make sure your cup of tea is free of any herbs your practitioner hasn't approved, read labels carefully; some brews that seem to be fruit based also contain a variety of herbs. Stick to regular (black) tea (preferably caffeine free) that comes already flavoured, or mix up your own by adding any of the following to boiling water or decaffeinated tea; orange, apple, pineaipple, or other fruit juice, slice of lemon, lime, orange, apple, pear or other fruit, mind leaves, cinnamon, nutmeg or cloves. <br>  <br>  Green tea should probably be limited during pregnancy since it may interfere with cell development and growth.

6eeafdafbc60d498e86fb6433657d23aaa	your doctor should be able to tell you without an u/s. my sister had twins, and the doctor by how high her uterus was. she freaked out but it was ok in the end. and in dec. they will be 3 years old. they are something to. tell your your concerns and what has been happening. GOOD LUCK!! and keep me posted.|`|80f2a4f17174c011c57bb255dd2b591faa	Of course it is possible...but I wouldn't bet on it based on your symptoms.  Every pregnancy is different and every woman is different.  With my first 2 pregnancies I had morning sickness, and with my current one I haven't had any at all!  (Thank God)  With my first two I didn't have any stomach pains or stetchy feelings and with this one I am.  (Unfortunately)<br>  Last December I miscarried multiples at 15 weeks and never had any indication that it was triplets until I had an ultrasound...unfortunately I miscarried just 2 weeks later.  I felt the same as I had with the first two pregnancies.  I did start to show at about 10 weeks...but then with my current pegnancy I began showing at the same time and this time there is only one baby.<br>  Just try and be patient and wait for the ultrasound...and remember, even if you knew it was twins before the ultrasound....seeing them with your own two eyes...will still be a bit of a shock!   I know I couldn't believe it when I watched the sonographer measure what appeared to be a head...THREE times!<br>  Good luck to you and congratulations on the pregnancy!|`|83d112280c215255ef331aba38814a2baa	If your pregnant with twins when you have your next doctors visit you should voice your concerns.  If you are having twins there are things your doctor can look for like a high pregnancy hormone level. ( They check for this at every visit usually).<br>  <br>  I have two year old twins- I had a sonogram at about 8 weeks and you could definity see two babies! Even that early!|`|ba30c9b84725091dfcbb402b4a73f45aaa	Every pregnancy is different.. my 2nd was FAR WORSE than the 1st, nausea all the time, and lasted full 4 month, the first one only like 2.5m, and much less frequent.    If this is your 3rd, you will start showing sooner, because your muscles are looser, and they "remember" what to do.     Even if you were having twins, there should be no visible/feelable difference, they are not even 1 ounce each yet!
fc3045470b792b9f04d696b7f2f9cd91aa	No, 131 is definitely borderline high and not in the normal range for blood pressure. It's more of a problem in pregnant women than say for instance a male that had 131 bp.  It indicates that you may be at risk for preeclampsia.  They will probably test your urine for protein as well, which is another indicator of preeclampsia.  If your blood pressure continues to rise at every visit, even when following the doctor's directions about diet and resting, they will induce you.  Of course they will wait if it's not serious for that crucial 36-37 week mark, but they are going to be monitoring you closely!<br>  <br>  ***EDIT***<br>  <br>  If your blood pressure doesn't respond to a different diet and resting, etc and continues to rise at every visit (whatever the doctor suggests you do at home) then there is nothing you can do because it might be that you are developing preeclampsia.  There is no way to lower your blood pressure for that other than delivering the baby.  Which they will do if the situation becomes dire.  Do not worry though, if your doctor sees a problem he/she will discuss it with you and develop the next course of action.  Congrats on your pregnancy and good luck!|`|eu6UQElYaa	Actually normal is considered to be 90/60 to 120/80<br>  131 is getting pretty high.  Between 120 and 139 for the top number is prehypertension.  80 to 89 for the bottom is prehypertension.  140 or over is hypertension.<br>  <br>  As far as what point it leads to induction just kind of depends on the doctor and the problems associated with preeclampsia that the mother is experiencing.   If there's alot of protein in the urine and other symptoms present then the doctor would probably induce sooner and even at a lower high blood pressure point than without.  Otherwise they may leave it alone unless it gets very high like over 140.|`|G4qP2gATaa	It is kind of high. <br>  <br>  Your blood pressure has probably been a lot lower than that at previous appointments.<br>  <br>  Like my BP is usually 98-110/60-80|`|5RvTXdmUaa	AHHH!! I had 132/60 and I thought that was ok. I'll have to get mine checked again also and talk to my doc. Glad I read this question now, lol. But still, Congrats and Good luck! :)|`|2B2fgmw9aa	140+ is high
fMnzjULCaa	Like everybody else said, it is illegal for them not to hire you b/c you are pregnant. But I'm not sure how exactly you would prove it. I'm sure your reference feels horrible. It sucks that you have to find a job while your pregnant & I know I'm going to be ripped apart for this, but I honestly don't blame people for not wanting to hire somebody when they are pregnant. Yes it's not fair to us as pregnant women, but just think, most places you have to work a really long time before you are granted time off. A lot of times new employees can't even call off sick!  But by law they are going to have to let you off for appointments & medical leave when you have the baby. Plus a lot of times new moms don't come back. It takes a lot of time & $ to train somebody & why would you want to take that time & $ just to have somebody be off work for a long time & be leaving a lot for appts or for morning sickness, etc. I just don't feel a pregnant women is an ideal person to hire as a new employee. I've been at my job 4 years & my performance has majorly slipped since becoming pregnant. It's not a pregnant woman's fault but I really don't blame employers either.|`|DutTBV3caa	i'm sorry that happened to you. you seem like a really big person to not get mad at your friend (not like fat big but like good person big lol). i had trouble getting a job when i wasn't pregnant and now that i am, i bet if i was still looking, it'd be even harder. unfortunetly, its a bad time for job hunters.<br>  <br>  i agree about asking this in the law section, as well.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	wow that really sux !!! well just keep looking u know? sorry u didint get it .. it sounds very fishy why they ddnt hire u .. ppl are so ignorant sometimes|`|QMxEjCpiaa	I haven't been rejected from a job or found it hard to find a job while pregnant because I've been with my current job almost 2 years and am only 15 weeks pregnant with my first. <br>  But I must say that I have been invovled in interviewing several staff people recently and have noticed that getting hired doesn't depend on how much experience you have. This sounds horrible, but it's based more on your personality and how the employers feel that you would fit into their department. At my job, I am assigned to tour the people around campus and create small talk with the people. It's done on an informal level but I am still observing and asking questions to find out responses. I then come back to the office where I give my reasons for chosing a particular candidate and what they/we talked about. I don't know anything about their education, experience, or the way they answered the questions ... I just give an open opinion. <br>  <br>  So my point is that an interview is not just based on job/work experience but by the people you know and your behavior in the interview. Sounds horrible, but it's true.|`|D8x0w6FMaa	You should tell her that it's against the law to tell anyone that calls for a reference that you are pregnant. In fact she can only say yes you worked there and here are the dates of employment. Nothing beyond that. I had the same thing happen a few weeks ago and it was suggested to me by a government agency to get a lawyer. I decided instead to tell the head boss of the department and the lady who gave out my information was reamed and told if it was found out she did it again that would be her last day on the job.|`|AA10458750	First off, I would get that girl back....she was trying to be funny by telling them you were pregnant. They didn't just come out & ask her that, esp since you're not showing. That girl is not your friend and you SHOULD be mad at her! About the job....everybody is having trouble finding a job right now with or without being pregnant, so don't feel bad.Try telemarketing,it's not the most exciting job but they are always hiring.|`|9P26sacKaa	It's illegal to discriminate against you because of your pregnancy.  You just might have enough evidence to say that this is what happened.  I would contact a lawyer, if you can, or just keep looking for jobs until you find another one.<br>  <br>  Pregnancy is seen as any other health concern - they cannot discriminate against it.|`|7KYwQAxpaa	Hell yes! I'm 6 months pregnant and when I go into apply or ask for an application for employment people look at me like I'm crazy! I think they don't want to hire me because they think I'll be too much of a 'hassle' or liability. I'm afraid I'm going to spend the rest of my pregnancy unemployed. Good think my fiance has a great job. Hard times.|`|GXRoAWNHaa	Just don't mention it until your hired. They cannot fire you for it.|`|UclzjUAKaa	my mum took her employers to court for that, and won. you should investigate it further.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	That may have been illegal for the reference to disclose that.  Id ask in the legal section here.|`|FplTPoAyaa	It is illegal for a prospective employer to turn you down for a job because you are pregnant.  If the reference that told them you were pregnant was a former employer, then yes, it was illegal for them to disclose that information.  They violated HIPPA privacy laws.  If the reference was a personal one, then unfortunately, there isn't much you can do but be upset.  I did not have a problem finding a job when I was pregnant, but I was probably lucky.  Good luck to you.
2Hot9EJiaa	I did. I was adopted as an infant and my husband and I adopted 2 children, a son who is 20 and a daughter who is 17. If you feel like adopting later on, go for it.  I would suggest that the child you foster/adopt be younger than your bio child.  Just because it would be easier on your bio child I think to be the eldest. Just a thought. I never had any bio children, so I really am not sure that what I said makes sense, but it is something that seems right to me.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Nope. No way. The only adoption I think is moral is foster care adoption, but I do not think I would be a good foster parent.  <br>  I have too many unresolved issues stemming from my own relinquishment and subsequent adoption, and think I would try to "parent myself". <br>  I think foster parenting and foster adoption is wonderful, but I don't think I have it in me. Kudos to those who do. THEY are the ONLY kids who need homes.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	As an adoptee, I could not in good conscience, take part in separating natural families.   So I do volunteer work with women and families to help them stay together wherever possible and also offer respite care to families who are temporarily struggling.|`|zLoyo24Taa	I was adopted and I am in the process of adopting.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Yep, I have...twice.  And we are waiting for another match for our third and final adoption.|`|1pEpiq7raa	Adoption is GREAT!!<br>  <br>  I have adopted 5 children now and it was the best things i could have ever done. I also waited until i had my first child. Have you considered Race or ethnicity? When i adopted, it was no problem for me. I have 3 african american children (adopted) and three white children (two of them adopted) I think it would be great for you to adopt.<br>  <br>  Kenya Jessica - 3 (Adopted) - Twin<br>  Shakuma Rain - 3 (Adopted) - Tiwn<br>  Davonte James - 6 (Adopted)<br>  Hannah Louise - 1 (Adopted)<br>  Brody Franklin - 12 (Adopted)<br>  Jack Andrew Austin - 16 (i gave birth)<br>  <br>  All my kids treat eachother as if they were blood related. In my home, we are all equal|`|E7MgO2pZaa	I'm an adoptee. I'm 21 years old. I once thought that I wanted to adopt, because I felt that I owed it to society as an adoptee. That kind of thinking came from the same place that the thinking that I HAD to be grateful to my adoptive parents for saving me from a tragic life in my native country. <br>  <br>  Now that my thoughts on adoption have evolved and I have grown up I have come to the realization that if I am to have children I want to bear children that share my own dna. I want to experience the mother/child bond first hand. I personally believe if you cant bear children, that is an indicator you are not meant to have them. And that's okay. If my fiance and I can't have kids, I'll deal with it and grieve for that loss. <br>  <br>  I dont think I'd be a good candidate for adoption. It would be like cutting my primal wound open to have to participate in something that has hurt me so deeply.|`|M1KYxcvSaa	I think that's a wonderful idea.  Just a note to think about though is that it is usually recommended to take in children younger than any other children already in the home.  The thinking is that while it's quite natural to add younger siblings to a family, it tends to be harder on a kid to lose their spot as the oldest child.|`|BDHlzlnwaa	Yes, I'm a foster Mom and an adopted Mom internationally.|`|frpCK0utaa	i would love to be a foster parent, and want to adopt through that, if possible.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	I don't know...I'm grateful that I got adopted, because it kept me out of the system, and I'd love to give a child that opportunity....but I don't know that I could raise someone else's child.
i1gesbh5aa	At that age boys are really hesitant to approach a girl.  Since you're so shy and keep to yourself they probably find it harder to talk to you.  Once you start coming out of your shell i'm sure you'll find more boys likin' ya.|`|yV8fog7Paa	you need to dress like a whore or slut by letting your boobs and a-- fall out of your clothes and have sex with every guy, then you'll be popular. <br>  Or don't.|`|8CCttFS6aa	What makes you think boys don't like you? At that age, many boys are awkward and have trouble expressing their feelings. You never know. Many 14 year old boys don't know how to flirt. You shouldn't question what's wrong with you, it doesn't sound like you have anything to worry about. Focus on one boy you particularly like. Make some small talk and see how he responds. I'm sure this will reassure you.|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	Maybe they're intimidated.<br>  Boys in junior high/early high school aren't jerks yet, so they're probably shy too.<br>  Beauty is a burden.|`|dcd11iUwaa	boys are always intimidated by smart pretty girls.<br>  just be yourself and someone you like will come along soon.|`|soFpywFcaa	guys like  gurls that are easy and that means that they dont have to work hard but for you they probably would and thats a good thing hun|`|AA12088442	try to put urself out there... get people to notice you :)<br>  hey we have the same name haha|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Too much of a good thing..

I bet if you made the first move you could have any boy in the school. But you are young, and there will be plenty of boys in your future. Just stay true to who you are, and don't go changing to "fit in", or to get a boy because if they are anyone you want to be friends with, you won't have to change anything.|`|XTj0LP6gaa	Most likely the boys think that they don't have a chance with you or they don't know if you're interested.  The 'weirdos' that have asked you out are more confident in themselves and are at least willing to take the risk of talking to you.  They are probably much better catches than the weak boys that are too afraid to talk to you.  Maybe you should give them a chance.|`|Ry77jN0qaa	1: you say you are shy, most guys wont try to hit on a shy girl, they know they will most likely get turned away/ignored.<br>  <br>  2: try cutting your hair.<br>  <br>  3: you dont have to flirt per se, just talk with other guys around you in class or whatever, get yourself in other groups of people.|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	Asking you out would not necessarily mean they like you, by the way, but don't worry someday you will be old enough to know what nitwits 14 year old boys are as a rule. :)<br>  <br>  If you are really good looking, maybe they just assume you are already with someone or they are intimidated?|`|mUhZxm8Jaa	I'll say there probably are other boys with a crush on you, but don't have the guts to ask you out ;D<br>  <br>  I know that by own experience, and I got some weirds too, I guess some of them aren't that shy as others. :P  But just wait and someone nice should come along|`|o2gjtUw9aa	well you dont really flirt that could be a problem<br>  if you get in the game with one person than others wil think more of you.<br>  <br>  so if you go out with someone than that persons mate might think<br>  'wow she must be cool to go out with my mate'<br>  and than think more of you|`|rlUQa9shaa	you're 14...and 14 year old boys are weird all together.

I have said no to 2 different guys and yes to 2 other ones, both which didn't work out, so don't try to get into a relationship right away, because otherwise it might not seem as special when the right guy does come along.<br>  You still have an entire life ahead of you and if you let your opinion on guys rule you, you won't complete anything. If the guys that you like, don't like you back , then they aren't worth it. Just live in the moment and Mr. Right will come along.|`|psWxRqSfaa	well your age gives it all. boys your age all they want is a bit of action(if you know what i mean) mainly popular more open boys and if there is any girls that look daring and have had 'experience' in your year group then they will think that those girls will be easy too pull of . trust me i am the same age and boys do it all the time but sexy girls should have the confidence to say no. but if your looking for someone mature then get too know them a bit better and then you could try asking then out and see if they will use you or not. either way you'll find someone one day. Boys will start too become more mature in a few years, after there hormones are a litter calmer concentrate on your studies for now, cause it will worth it at the end when plently of boys inviting you to dates will be flooding your letter box hope i helped.|`|N99ho6xxaa	Guys are wierd. and thier hard to understand.<br>  make yourself more open,<br>  <br>  go up to a guy and say "hey whats up"<br>  try to get in conversation with them, i mean<br>  <br>  let them know your not no freak, your a open girl<br>  <br>  dont show your shy side, <br>  <br>  but get yourself out there, <br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  <br>  -emilee|`|Qhyovyj8aa	Maybe your standards are too high if you think all the guys that have liked you are weirdos.

And it is weird because only after high school and jr. high did boys say 'oh, i used to like you so much'. but just be confident, and don't worry about who or who doesn't like you. Just be happy, cheerful, and confident and some time in the near future I bet a boy will get enough balls to ask you out that is decent. If that doesn't work, when talking to guys tell them in a casual way how you want a bf, word will get around ;).
P0Fjh59Eaa	Not sure about my oldest son, he's my step son and we got custody when he was 3. My middle son was about a week old, but he didn't heal and we had to take him in for them to put something in his belly button that would heal it up. he was fine after a few days. My daughter was almost 3 weeks old when it finally fell off. My youngest son was around 3 or 5 weeks old.<br>  they can hang on for a while though. they used to tell you to use alcohol to dry it up when i had my middle son, but with my last two they told me to just leave it alone, which is why i think it stuck around for longer.|`|X6as2nOAaa	My baby lost hers when she was 5 days old.|`|eu6UQElYaa	My daughter was around 8 days and my son was around 10 days.|`|eRlNQxbNaa	My son lost his when he was almost three weeks!

bc29eaf19302ac3e6d0492b8facf1027aa	Your blood pressure is going down because your circulatory system is expanding at an extraordinary rate.  There simply isn't enough blood to fill it at any one time.  I actually suffer from vaso vagal syncope in my second trimester every pregnancy as a result of that.  Perfectly harmless, but it's not a good feeling when I'm about to faint.<br>  <br>  Your blood pressure will probably go back up in your third trimester, and in the last few weeks might even be considered 'high' due to water retention.  Nothing to worry about unless you have protein in your urine and are seeing spots along with facial swelling.
24cbe82f4481f98a4059fa4561ffa699aa	The only way to find out for sure is to either get your period or take a home pregnancy test.  <br>  <br>  If you are out of your mind with worry, go get a pregnancy test immediately.  It's the only way to really know and ease your mind.<br>  <br>  If you are and you're happy.  Congrats.<br>  <br>  If you aren't and you're happy, consider it a lesson learned.  Taking too many risks will increase your odds of getting pregnant.|`|8fd1b79cfa7a9667cb6a6912487437daaa	Take a test. We can't tell you if ure pregnant or not. But i bet you are. Dont have unprotected sex unless you are ready for a baby. Odds are pretty darn high!|`|baefb114f4e1544f93b02a89a34443f1aa	you are probably not your most fertal time is about 3 days before your pieriod...I would wait about 2 weeks and if you don't get your pieriod, then take a pregnancy test, or go to a doctor.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	Your fertile period is around 14days after the START of your last period, depending on your cycle length it could be more or less. And sperm can live for up to 5 days inside of you. you need to go get a test, or go to planned parenthood. If you are pregnant, tell your mom so you can get to the doctor. if you are not pregnant get on the pill or something.

I had it with one pregnancy but not with another.  In fact, I did not have it with the first, so seeing a bit of brown blood with the second one was a little scary.  But it was pretty scarce and everything turned out fine.|`|y2lbDkepaa	No.. you will not always have the implantation bleeding. <br>  Implantation bleeding is vaginal discharge which usually contains a small amount of pinkish or brownish blood. Only about a third of pregnant women experience implantation bleeding.<br>  It can happen at the time the fertilized egg implants in the uterus, on average between 6 to 12 days past ovulation. <br>  Hope this helps ya.. good luck.

If you suspect you may be pregnant and are experiencing any bleeding it's best to contact your GP/fertility clinic or NHS direct for reassurance.
PrBFkWumaa	Irregular periods can happen for all sorts of reasons and its not unusual for them to be this way when you have come off the pill.  It can take upto a year after coming off the pill to get it completely out of your system and for you to be able to fall pregnant.  If you are really concerened speak to your doctor so that he can do test to rule out things such as PCOS (poly cystic ovaries syndrome).|`|570254e8073063b07b006358b5dd47a3aa	after coming off the pill it can take up to 1 year to concieve.... be patient, and stay in contact with your doctor during this time...  some women don't show up on a hpt until later in their pregnancy.....  i wish you all the best.|`|a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	Try using fertility monitor to check your actual ovulation dates and try again.

c15aef0d506b86aceb5531ac083202d8aa	hi, well i hope you are! It's common for women to have an increase in discharge right before your period and also to have this when you become pregnant. So looks like your going to have to wait to see if your period comes.<br>  oh, and don't let anyone make you think you have an infection. discharge is completely normal!|`|KdX666bLaa	you may be pregnant but you may also have an infection you need to go to the doctor and yes some discharge is normal but the way you described it it is more like mucus so i would just go get checked out you know it could be a yeast infection as well.|`|148cce69e49f68436c86fb3bd7882888aa	i've heard of this happening to many people, so it's totally normal. sounds like you are ovulating. the egg is traveling the system, so to speak! sometimes when this happens, your body lets out more hormones than usual and the discharge occurs.<br>  <br>  if you feel uncormfortable about it, check with your dr.
AA11119837	Stripping the membranes is where a health care provider will separate your bag of water from the cervix, it is not intended to break your water, however, it may. It may also cause infection, and may be painful for some.<br>  <br>  The reason that we tell people that we are stripping their membranes is to "get things going" in regards to labor. This little technique is usually done during a vaginal exam at the end of pregnancy, with or without the knowledge or consent of the woman.<br>  <br>  Stripping the membranes, we are told, is supposed to stimulate production of prostiglandins in the cervix and bring on contractions. I have heard doctors tell my clients after stripping their membranes they will have the baby in two days. While this may appear to work for some, at term it's all a guessing game. There is no scientific work to date that can back up the routine procedure of stripping membranes.<br>  <br>  You may want to ask your care provider to avoid this procedure if you are worried about the effects and risks. Or you may want to avoid vaginal exams during the end of pregnancy for the same reasons, because unfortunately the cannot accurately predict when we will give birth.|`|742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	Yes it hurts a lot.  But it also can help your labor start.  They separate the amniotic sac from your cervix.  It's hard to explain, but they run their fingers around in your cervix, sort of lifting the sac.  They can't do it until you are dialated past 1 cm, obviously because they need to fit a finger or 2 in there.  It hurts, but it really works!|`|O7Hta3Q8aa	the membrain is what brakes when they say your water brakes....it is thick and when they strip they remove some layers to make it thinner so it will brake easyer and you will progress easyer into birth|`|vK63fo8aaa	Stripping membranes is when a doctor or midwife swipes a finger between the cervix and the membranes (bag of waters) holding the baby.  This often irritates the cervix and may or may not encourage labor to start.  It is often very uncomfortable to mildly painful.  It is usually followed by spotting or slight bleeding, passing of mucous and increase in contractions.

2HETgiwgaa	It was probably cervical mucous (CM) - if it was colourless, stretchy and like egg white - that's the most fertile type of CM.  A woman may notice this around the time of ovulation - it makes it easier for the sperm.  You can also get lotion like or creamy, thick and sticky, watery or dry CM - depending on the time of your cycle - all normal.<br>  <br>  Additional:  If you friend is in early pregnancy - that type of CM is also normal.  As pregnancy progresses, CM gets thicker and froms a mucous plug to protect the uterus and the baby from infection.|`|AA10458750	its regular discharge. a shower afterwards will wash the area better than a bath alone.|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	no, it is regular increased discharge. If she is really far along (like 35+ wks) it could potentially be the mucus plug. How far along is she? it is unlikely to miscarry after the first trimester and the chances are almost eliminated after week 16. <br>  If it is really bothering her and making her worried then have her call her midwife or doctor to ease her mind. Stress is hard on the baby. But i'm almost 100% that everything that is happening is just normal.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	If it was clear, then no.  That is normal, it is most likely her fertile time and she is near ovulation. That is cervical mucus|`|aiDV9FgGaa	Probably just the joys of increased vaginal discharge in pregnancy.
ynjgq4GZaa	It's terrible, and I cannot figure out why so many people think it should be chopped from the curriculum when there are budget woes.  I taught sex ed as part of a science class for 2 years, and part of the problem is legislative restrictions.  For instance, where I live, sex education is abstinence only, so I could not teach anything about birth control, unless specifically asked about it.  Many times, my students wouldn't ask because they were too embarrassed, and so a golden opportunity to properly educate them went right out the window.  It was very frustrating!|`|i8Ch743Laa	I would think it's not very good either. It seems like they're not even teaching them that they  CAN get pregnant anymore! So many of those questions are so ignorant,and I know when I was in school,that I knew the answers to most of those already.|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	Actually i think sex education is not bad at schools.<br>  But in the 'could i be..' questions have things that schools don't explain. And they feel to shy or embarrassed to ask.|`|AA10458750	Most sex ed classes don't talk about the emotional aspects of sex and why it's important to find someone you care about, not just get wasted and bang whoever.

I like to call it "do not have sex" education. It is responsible for at least hundreds of pregnancies nationwide.|`|5yBAMbIZaa	well usually people who teach sex education basically tell you that if you have sex you will get infected with some disease or something. of course, thats not true but people still fall into it so its kinda of a bad way to teach that actually works|`|wkd5CMNaaa	I totally agree. <br>  People still think the pull out method works and that peeing after sex prevents pregnancy...what does that tell ya. <br>  <br>  It's sad really.|`|AA10826403	Yeah i'm gonna have to agree with you. It seems especially on here that they have been taught nothing about sex.|`|5puE2Qfpaa	HEHE, HAHA, I know!
7SCjPftKaa	There is a hormone- Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)- that you can be injected with that will make a non pregnant person (even a male) produce a postitive pregnancy test and it will make women's bodies act in the normal way of pregnancy. This hormone is naturally produced in pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Dr Cecil Jacobson , a fertility doctor, was jailed for- amongst other things- injecting patients undergoing fertility treatment with this hormone rather than the medication that he should have been. They then took pregnancy tests and he provided them with false ultrasound pictures. He later told them that their foetus had died and stopped the injections, thus they would have a negative pregnancy test afterwards and the body would not continue with the pregnancy symptoms. <br>  <br>  I severely doubt, however, that your friend had any of this and they don't just make it in tablet form that anybody can get hold of.|`|96HWpdkFaa	No there is no pill that can do that.|`|uuHPneEcaa	This is the 3rd time i have seen this question today.. the answer is no..there isn't a pill that can make u look pregnant. she could just be trying to pull ur leg..make her take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  <br>  unless she is take fertility drugs (which i believe is in shot form not pill form) there isn't anything like that, that will make u pregnant.|`|AA10622097	I have had two children and each time my stomach was very different, you can't judge just by the shape of the stomach.

MxLJjZZjaa	Have you taken another test more recently?<br>  Sometimes they won't come out positive right away.<br>  But if you take another one first thing in the morning, and it comes back negative, I think you can pretty safely assume you're not pregnant. (If your last period started mid-January, you'd be about 7 weeks along, and it would be pretty weird not to get a positive hpt.) Sometimes our bodies do weird things on us -- maybe you didn't ovulate this month. I'm really regular, and I've missed a cycle here and there, too -- and, believe me, it freaked me out a couple times.<br>  And if you're very worried, you should see a doctor, just for the peace of mind.|`|1078b86d25fbbaaa77e4932ecb928cf5aa	there are medical conditions that can cause this - one is called polycystic ovary syndrome.

c35059e10a1338a31afe1247ef1497e7aa	Don't really understand what your getting at.<br>  <br>  The most fertile time of when a woman is more likely to get pregnant is when the women ovulates.  This normally, 14 days before your period should arrive.<br>  <br>  However a women can ovulate at any time, especially when they  have irregular periods.<br>  <br>  You should use protection at all times (if you are not trying for a baby) otherwise you are at risk at all times from pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and other infections.<br>  <br>  Go and see your doctor for more advice.<br>  <br>  And If Im wrong then sorry, but a question comes into my head, are you old enough to be having sex?|`|961c79fd5929d57f4e80f4fe4cb9135eaa	what?|`|2b9ffa184266370272bbaf5dbc3f00e1aa	um. what???<br>  <br>  a woman can get pregnant at ANY time..|`|b79071eb7eb3caf12d75f97cb462d08baa	all the same|`|bea548ddbc5b59b19e9cef8ec34f5dd6aa	There is a weak theory that if women can get pregnant 2 days before and 5 days after her period, but the best method is contraceptive.|`|f8845999fe4aaac20f77a835df027496aa	there is no minimum risk.|`|qWmjtDZvaa	no such thing. sorry. <br>  <br>  the best way for minimum risk is to use protection
742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	Stupid or not, at least you did the right thing by quitting.  There is always a chance of a lasting effect, but just be proud of yourself for not continuing.  The chances are far less if you do stop, so don't worry about it, there's nothing you can do about the past, and just be proud of yourself for doing the right thing and quitting.  If you had an ultrasound done already and there was nothing wrong with it then I'm sure everything is fine.  Just try not to start smoking again after the baby is born.  Second hand smoke is a large cause of SIDS.  Congrats on your baby, and on stopping smoking!|`|1be4edc02e57108d4225c302dc2aa763aa	There is no point in worrying about it - you can't go back and change it.<br>  <br>  My sister stopped smoking when she was pregnant.  Then her husband walked out on her and she went back to about 5 a day and her wee boy was born past his due date, 8lb and a picture of health.<br>  <br>  You've done well to stop now - you know yourself its for the best.<br>  <br>  I managed to stop but caved in towards the end and would have the odd sneaky draw.  My son was born healthy and still is.<br>  <br>  Speak to your midwife about your worries but don't sweat it - there is nothing you can do to change whats done.|`|46631a2fa6dd6668839d7e5fc2a81b80aa	Yes or no. It depends really. I think that most babies are fine but some babies can get asthma or other respiratory issues. The most common effect is low birth weight. You quit, that is the most important thing. Good for you!
2Nl9tfIiaa	I used clearblue...I would use a hpt that didn't have lines anytime now. I don't know why you would have bleeding unless it was your first time, but you said that you've been trying for a while...so I dunno. I hope you are!! I think that you are, but maybe you haven't had your period bcuz you are stressing or think that you are. Hormones are odd like that! lol...Just drink some water and take another test...not cheap tho! Good luck!|`|cf98d4945a0896712e6aa89234f858c2aa	wait a week, take another test. you may not be enough far along for it to show up yet.|`|n097OBPdaa	I would say that you are pregnant you just aren't processing enough hcg yet to make the test positive . I would go buy one of the more expensive ones that are digital and only take with your first morning urine!! GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATS!!!!!|`|c35059e10a1338a31afe1247ef1497e7aa	No one can say whether you are pregnant or not, that is giving false hopes!!!!<br>  <br>  Best to wait 4 weeks after the time when you thought you conceived, then do a test, so try and work that out.  Or you should get a positive 2 weeks after your missed period, if that's an easier way to work it out!<br>  <br>  I have heard that some people didn't even get a positive until they were 2 months, everyone is different.<br>  <br>  Then on the other hand, if you are thinking about it loads then it can delay your period!<br>  <br>  I have been ttc for 6 months and been there plenty of times. Make an appointment to see your doctor whom will then carry out a blood test, these are more advanced.<br>  <br>  And good luck :-) x
694fb2aff6ccdf840b93a96972cbdd24aa	Old wives' tales are perhaps as old as language itself. They're part of our oral tradition, originating long before pen and ink, books and movies, and certainly before the Internet. Why do we cling to such tales about common ailments and our health when we live in a world rich with medical expertise and proven treatments and cures?<br>  <br>  Some probably have survived through the ages because they offer comforting advice about experiences we all share, have little control over, and usually worry about, such as birth and sickness.<br>  <br>  Many old wives' tales, especially those surrounding pregnancy and childbirth, have been proven false or ineffective by advances in medicine and technology. One example is the use of prenatal ultrasound to detect the sex of a fetus instead of dangling a ring suspended on a string over the expectant woman's belly. According to the tale, if the ring swings from side to side, it's a girl, and if it swings in a circle, it's a boy. An ultrasound reading may not be as much fun, but the test results are certainly more accurate.<br>  <br>  Some old wives' tales about health and sickness have some basis in fact, whereas other, newer ones seem to reflect a kind of technophobia, such as those related to watching television. Some old wives' tales are true, most are harmless - and at least one described here is dangerous.<br>  <br>  Tales About Pregnancy<br>  If the fetal heart rate is under 140 beats per minute (BPM), it's a boy.<br>  <br>  Extra weight out front means a girl; weight around the hips and bottom indicates a boy.<br>  <br>  If a woman's carrying low, it's a boy; if a woman's carrying high, it's a girl.<br>  <br>  Dark nipples indicate a boy.<br>  <br>  If your left breast is bigger than the right during pregnancy, you're having a girl. If the right is bigger, it'll be a boy. If they are the same size, you're in for a surprise!<br>  <br>  If you get moody during pregnancy you are more likely to have a girl. This is because all women are moody, and when carrying a girl you become doubly so.<br>  <br>  If you carry the baby out front (others can’t see your pregnancy from behind) then you will have a boy. If others can tell that you are pregnant when looking at you from behind, then you will have a girl.<br>  <br>  Have the mum-to-be pick up a key. If she picks it up by the round end, it will be a boy. If she picks it up by the long end, it will be a girl. Should she pick it up at the middle, twins are on the way.<br>  <br>  If the mother's age at conception and the year of conception are both even or both odd, the baby is a girl. If one is even and one is odd, the baby is a boy.<br>  <br>  Ask the mum-to-be to pick a number. Match the number with the corresponding letter of the alphabet (A=1, B=2 etc). Then ask her to choose a name beginning with that letter. If she chooses a boys name, it will be a boy. If she chooses a girls name, it will be a girl<br>  <br>  <br>  also try this interactive indicator test|`|0384e9b5fb1fd85ece0382882ee4d5dcaa	IF YOU CARRY HIGH YOU ARE HAVING A BOY, LOW FOR A GIRL.|`|96e831baa272f7f9b2a90151f63bf4b4aa	Well, there's one that is right on quite often but you need to ask the doctor about the heart rate of the baby.  If it's over 150, it's a girl and if it's less than 150 it's a boy.  If it's at 150, it could go either way.|`|2FH6IuPlaa	I have head if you stand behind her looking at her back and you can not tell she is pregnant until she turns around GIRL.

rdpZrBc9aa	I think you need a second opinion.  If you are pregnant, the IUD could cause problems for the baby.  It could also cause a miscarriage.  And an ectopic pregnancy can kill you.|`|57389f506490a5ebd9798a3a388fb6f5aa	hey there, Im on the nuva ring adn found out I was pregnant on tuesday.

I would wait for the scan because there isn't even a uterus lining really for the egg to implant. Not to mention taking it out could cause you to miscarry if the cervix is opened and anything pulled from your uterus... Good Luck and update me on the scan. <br>  <br>  Take care.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Yes, I remember reading before (sorry cant remember where) It depends, if they can still see the string. If your doctor says it is safe, it most likely is. But I know I've read somewhere that it is safe and it'll just come out when you give birth.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
QLopvWKDaa	Yes- It is a sign of early labour!  I went into labour the same day as this exact symptom.  Call your doctor and let him know, they will give you an idea of what else to watch for.

Its sort of like preparation for whats about to happen. Good Luck|`|QdFOTKs9aa	Nausea late in pregnancy is not uncommon. Late afternoon/night nausea is related to skipping meals. Have you been experiencing dizziness as well? These two symptoms often go hand-in-hand. Remember, your baby is growing rapidly this late in pregnancy and demands alot of your nutritional intake. This means you need to make sure you are providing your baby and yourself sufficient amount of fluids and food throughout the day. Word of advice: if you eat dinner, at say, 8pm eat a night snack a few hours later. <br>  Few things to think about. Do you keep a tight check on your blood pressure? And blood sugar?  When you are skipping meals, your blood sugar & blood pressure will drop. <br>  <br>  Because you are also experiencing frequent bathroom trips for #2, you have to take into consideration of your fluid intake. Make sure you are keeping yourself hydrated. There has to be a healthy mom in order to have a healthy baby. :)  As far as if something is "wrong" because of your frequent trips, don't worry. The frequency is often related to the high rise in hormones this late in pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Good luck & God bless!|`|ieGiQ1vgaa	My best friend could not stay off the toilet right before she went into labor with both of her kids.

0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	You have full custody; it's your decision whether to have him baptized or wait until he makes the decision himself. Contact your church office for more information and requirements/dates/paperwork/other that they need. Asking for a counseling session with a pastor would also be beneficial to get any questions you have answered.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Yes you can.  I myself an Anglican which is the name given to your Episcopalian church in most countries outside the US.  While we as Anglicans practice Confirmation thats essentially just a reaffirmation, as an adult, of the Baptismal vows taken on your behalf when you were an infant so don't worry about it too much.  <br>  <br>  Contact a minister within the Episcopalian church local to you and he/she can set you up.  Whether you are the only parent doesn't make a difference.  They can still do it for you.  When my children were Baptised we didn't even have Godparents assigned.  We chose not to go that route.  <br>  <br>  It may be a good time as well for you to reconsider your involvement with the Church.  If it's important enough for you to have your child baptized then perhaps it's time that you went further and started to attend once again so that your child gains the benefits of church participation and the understanding that goes with it.|`|1ezYfkX7aa	You can still get your son baptized being a single mom. The only thing of concern if you havnt been to church. Most churches require you to be a member and actually attend church. I would call and ask what conditions have to be met in order for your son to be baptized. My church makes you and the god parents take classes, the godparents much belong to my church and attend etc. Hopefully the rules of your church are more lenient then mine because i really think my churches rules are ridiculous to have your child baptized. Goodluck.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	I personally think that a child should chose when to be baptized. Its an outward expression and an inward commitment. When your 10 months old you can't make that decision. I would suggest having your child "committed to Christ" instead of baptized.|`|WPI0Z47saa	You do not need both parents as long as the church agrees to do it. Some are particular if you don't belong to their chirch and attend it.|`|VKQzj4Pmaa	Baptizing a child is not biblical at all. The Bible clearly teaches that baptism is to take place *after* salvation. I'm sure your 10 month old doesn't understand the concept of God, sin, heaven and hell, grace and faith, and much less about salvation.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of churches that will baptize your son for you, just call around. But the Bible can assure you that it will do nothing for his spirit or soul.<br>  <br>  Edit: Jennifer T- I don't get annoyed by internet strangers very often, but your answer was the most ridiculous, misinformed statement against true Christianity that I have read in a long time.|`|JWNzoksmaa	having your child baptized has nothing to do with your marital status. it has to do with your child being accepted into heaven....that is according to christian beliefs that.  christians believe that children are born of sin, from sin and are sinful from the get go. buy baptising your child your cleansing him /her of the sin of sex basically. i know it sounds stupid...b/c it is..but that's what christians believe.|`|ou0Wy3B0aa	I was baptized by my mom only, so no.

2HETgiwgaa	There is an increased risk of deformity and developmental delay - so, you and your doctor need to talk through whether you should take it, or if there might be alternatives.  If you're already taking it, don't stop without medical advice.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Always inform your doctor if you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, before using any medicine.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/100000936.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/100...</a><br>  <br>  There is a section on pregnancy and the medication there.|`|uVEDt4Woaa	Epilim is a dangerous drug to use during pregnancy. However, you still need to take sort of anticonvulsant medication (I presume for epilepsy), so don't stop taking it if you are already on it. It is a drug that can cause a higher occurrence of developmental defects throughout the entire pregnancy.<br>  <br>  First of all, you need to consult your regular doctor NOW to either get your dose reduced to the lowest therapeutic dose possible, change to a different drug, or he may just want to monitor pregnancy early on using ultrasound or amniocentesis (sticking a needle into the sac where the baby is) for any developmental abnormalities. <br>  <br>  You also need to make sure you take folic acid, as epilim leads to a much higher incidence of developmental disorders that occur, especially in the first trimester. Folic acid also helps reduce spinal cord defects in the first 6 weeks or so of pregnancy (so perhaps <br>  before you would even know).<br>  <br>  Good luck to you, I hope your pregnancy goes smoothly!!

It sounds like your fiance just wants to avoid a conflict and that certainly isn't a good enough reason to go along with this.<br>  <br>  Put your foot down. To both your fiance and soon-to-be-in-laws. Your child, your choice. Simple as that. Just sit down with them and tell them that you're not baptizing your son at this point. You would like to wait until he's old enough to make this a conscious decision himself, if that's what he chooses.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	I would be pretty angry about this!  Even IF you were close with them and they had been a big part of your son's life, the key phrase is "your son".

My parents and my husbands parents are both religious and they are the same religion (mormons) they baptize at 8. I don't think my children should get baptized then. If they want to when they are older that is their choice and I will support them, but we feel that at 8 years old they don't know what they want. They are not old enough to decide if they want to get baptized. If you feel that way, then say no. You are his mother and it's your choice. If you do not want him baptized then don't do it. Tell your fiance that is how you feel, that your son will not be baptized and you don't care if you offend them because they are offending you by not being a part of his life and then trying to force you into baptizing your son.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Most churches expect that the parents, not grandparents, be active members of a church in order for their child to be baptized.   There are reasons for this, it's one thing if the grandparent's are the guardians, but another thing entirely to bypass the parent's role, which is what is happening here.   You are right, this should be your thing not theirs.  Of course if they are Mormon they can have you and your child baptized Mormon without you being present, they just need to spend money to do so - heck even buried folks can be baptized that way.   Think my uncle did that for us at one point (whatever!   So not Mormon!).<br>  <br>  Stick up for yourself and what you believe, especially here - baptism should not be done without belief by the parents and support of the child for following the faith.   Or, it's worth something and should not be treated this way.|`|3Ophdo9raa	Stand your ground and tell them to go to hell--nicely but firmly. Remind them they have not been involved in the child's life and have no say so about his religious upbringing. And tell your fiance (I'd give that serious thought) he better grow a spine and decide who side he's going to be on--yours or his family.

I just ignore them and if they really get overbearing I just tell them to mind their own business. It is your child and your decision and a decision that should not be made lightly. I would put your foot down and tell them that if they want to be apart of your sons life fine, but major decisions will be left up to you and your fiance. We also believe that our children's religion should be left up to them when they are able to decide what they want to believe in.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Maybe this is their way of reaching out to be a part of your sons life. If you do not put stock into it, then why not do it, if your fiance wants you to go along with it. Families that get along all do things for each other that they would never do for themselves. I do not think you are being unreasonable, but I do not think they are either. They probably raised their child one way, and had deep hopes that he would choose to raise his child the same way. Think of the love you have for your child, they have that same adoration for your fiance. I have no doubt that what you are saying is logical, but sometimes the love between families transcends logic.|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	I would feel the same exact way. Being baptized should be meaningful and religious. It is an insult to God to do it just to please someone and the in laws should look at it the same exact way. It is supposed to be your decision and it should be. It is your child and your fiances, not his parents. If you both can't come to an agreement on doing it or not then it shouldn't be done until then. You aren't unreasonable and you shouldn't do it just to please them.<br>  Stand your ground, mommy. especially since the in laws have seemed to fall from thin air until now!|`|dAQHWvY0aa	No. NO NO AND A THOUSAND TIMES NO. They have about as much right to overstep you as Calebs mumma on this issue, as they would to spank your child, to decide diet for your child, or to insist you change his nap times. You feel strongly about organized religion - regardless of their views, this is part of the responsibility you took on as a parent; To decide what your baby is a part of and what he isn't, in alllll things. I'm sure their intentions are good *snicker* and I LOVE their timing in laying on the pressure *more snickering* but I **** you not, lovey, they will not be made happy by you catering to their wish. It will encourage future decisions being made without you, like his first birthday, for example - and you are allowing them to put undo stress on your relationship before your wedding. This is what I would say to either parent;<br>  "We have talked about your proposition, and at this time we feel we have other priorities that demand our attention. Our wedding day is only 3 weeks away, and we feel we need more than 3 weeks to talk in depth about what route we are going to take with this. Thank you for your offer, it was very gracious, but WE will let YOU know what we will be doing AFTER the wedding. Thanks for coming out." Send it in an email, if you want. Just DON'T let them overstep you or hubby just to keep the peace - It won't work. They'll find something else to stress you out about before the big day.|`|gvLjbVFJaa	You should stick to your guns on this. <br>  If you don't want to do it, than they should respect YOUR wishes as it's YOUR child. I'd hardly doubt they would want you guys to go through with it, for the sake of going through the motions. If it was that important to them, they would want you to do it out of true believing so therefore it would have some sort of meaning and importance to you and your child. It makes no sense to go through the whole baptism ordeal, if you aren't going to follow through with his religious upbringing.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	No, you should not let them do it just because they want to. I agree with you. Its none of there business how his religious upbringing is. Why do they care? They havent been apart of his life for 6 months and now all of a sudden they do? Bullcrap. Tell them in a polite way, No thanks. We will get him baptized when we feel it is the right time, or we will save that decision for him when he gets older. <br>  <br>  <br>  No, you arent being unreasonable at all. You dont have to please them for any reason. They havent pleased you, so why you should you please them. And, like you said, Baptizing is a big ordeal and should only be done when it is a meaningful experience.|`|lJ5Ao2aIaa	I know what you're feeling, passed through that before.<br>  I think you shouldn't do something just to please them when you are not convinced, unless it is gonna cause problems between you and your fiance. Otherwise, when you do what they want, there is gonna be a next thing they want and feel is better for the baby, then another... then another... and they will start to control a lot of things in your sons life this way... think about it and discuss it with your fiance.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	No way lady!  Stick to your guns!  I absolutely agree with you!  I don't think you're being unreasonable at all!  This is you, and your husband's child!  You bring your kiddo up the way YOU both want to....don't even listen to his parents.  Especially since they haven't even been in the picture, you know? Good luck!|`|Xu1lG9Dcaa	Your fiance should be the one to tell them no. He sounds like a coward. Good luck, you're marrying a real winner. He's a panzy & his family's crazy! Alright for you!|`|gWiZAsfBaa	I'd be mad in your position. No, don't do it just to make them happy or so that they will shut up about it.|`|GJgZVKvXaa	You and your fiance are the baby's parents and should make a decision between the two of you.  Once you and your fiance make up your minds, you should then calmly but firmly tell his parents what is going to happen.  <br>  <br>  You need to get tough about sticking up to people who try to pressure you because others always have an opinion about bringing up children ... you need to get comfortable making your decisions and telling others to back off.  If you start now, when your son is small, it will get easier with time!|`|r4E2zXL8aa	No, don't do it... Why should you do what they say? What if they asked to dye your sons hair pink, would you do it just to "make them happy" no you wouldn't. I think they are being very pushy & they need to back up a bit. I also think you need to put your fiance in his place.. Sounds like he's never disobeyed his mommy. You two are the parents. Show it. So what if you piss them off, they haven't been in your son's life for 6 months... what are you losing?|`|tx8OTfFUaa	Unreasonable, no.  Why haven't they bothered to inquire about the boy before now?  Does your fiance's mom have a control problem?  I agree with you that religion or your views on spirituality are personal and you are offering your son the option of choosing this personally.  I can't tell you how many stories I have heard from friends and others about being forced to go to church.  I wouldn't want my child to look at spirituality through the eyes of force.  I would want him to find the peace that lies within faith.  You are correct in your feelings and should act accordingly.

kv8ZFPP1aa	i'm confused. were you sexually abused and you told your parents and they refused to report it? and why can't you talk to your counselor about it for the next 2 weeks?? i would go to someone else and tell them about it and maybe they can help you report it.|`|7qRFw5fjaa	Was the abuse from an adult or another child?  Children generally don't abuse, they are merely exploring and most are innocent enough.  On the other hand, if it was an adult, you should first find out what happened and then make a decision to either go to the proper authorities or to the person in question.  I don't quite get the connection to a counselor.  Do you have physical or mental problems of your own?  Was the counselor the one who touched your daughter?  ???  Oh, I am sorry.  I just didn't put 2+2 together.  Still at 12yrs old, I don't believe it is abuse unless it was a repeated act, and even then 12yrs old isn't really conscious of moral judgment.   8yrs old definitely is a tender age.  That would be a very hard call for any parent to make.  Getting rid of the bullying boy would be the first step, but would you try to ruin a childs(yes 12 is a child) life?  Steps to feeling good about your self most often start with depression and then to anger.  At that point, most of the worst is starting to fade.  The best things to do are to look at your good points, and to make a mental note to yourself each day to do something you enjoy. Even if it isn't all smiles, one little smile can be the turning point in your life.  And remember as corny as it sounds, Jesus loves you.|`|5ba049abc44fd99ab0e13d585c2beddaaa	1. A parent who wouldnt report that might think that the 8 yo wasn't serious or was lying or was only tickled or something... idk i would report it if i was a parent<br>  <br>  2. I think you should, if only to let your feelings out. good luck : )|`|E2OKRhwYaa	1. If my daughter no matter how old she is tells me that kind of thing I would definitely report it.<br>  <br>  2. If it'll help you out and clear your mind, I say go for it.|`|qlA9Lhazaa	Yes, speak to someone else asap. It is not good that your counselor said it wasn't abuse. It was abuse and it wasn't your fault!  Maybe you can try finding a counselor that specializes in sexual abuse. I'm only 15, but if my child ever came to me and said she'd been touched you can bet I would report it to police and do everything in my power to keep the bastard that did it in jail. Some parents don't report it because of the age of the abuser, or because they feel it would be harmful to the child. I disagree. I believe it is more harmful for the child to keep his or her feelings locked up. Tell your counselor how you feel and tell her you NEED to talk about it. She gets paid to listen to you, and if she doesn't find someone else. Email me if ya need to talk. You are in my prayers. <3 Sarah K|`|bR4BgFLlaa	For the first question: I would report it, there is absolutely no reason good enough not to.<br>  <br>  For the second: You should definitely speak to someone, even if its just to lighten the load you are carrying, but be sure to get professional help too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|N24wkFROaa	As a parent why wouldn't you report sexual abuse if your daughter of 8 told you she'd been touched in places?<br>  <br>  Well they would have to be a really BAD parent to not report it.<br>  <br>  And try speaking to a therapist, and you should talk to your counsellor, for the best.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	1. If I was a parent I would totally report it. But I'm not and thats not what your asking. You are asking WHY I wouldn't. Well one reason is because I may no the guy and not want them in trouble. Or I don't want anybody to know. I would probably be embarressed and not want anybody to know. But I am not a parent. If I was I WOULD REPORT It. Those were just some reasons. I came up with.<br>  <br>  2. Yes, you should speak to somebody. It will help you get over this and start fresh. There are people there to help you. It's really important you tell somebody because if say a parent knows they can report it and get that person off the streets. It could mean somebody else getting hurt.

chrJtVATaa	I don't know much about the nuva ring. But I can tell you I felt the same way you did at first. I didn't feel pregnant, but I spoke to soon because now I'm nateuos almost everyday from 1pm till almost the rest of the day. So you better wait a little while. Also I think were almost the same b.c my due date is also in 10/2009. And I believe the symptoms are usually felt for the first 3 months...|`|AA11661992	with my son (now 20 months) i never once threw up, but around the 4th month i began feeling sick & nauseous, etc. off & on, then later of course the back pain. but over all i had it easy. i don't remember for sure when we first heard the heartbeat i want to say 12 weeks? but i'm not positive. you can find out the gender at 20 wks. Congratulations on the baby! & good luck!|`|lRr46ABUaa	Symptoms are different with each pregnancy. My 1st one I was sicker than a dog lol! But my 2nd preganancy I was fine I never got sick. Once you go to the dr and you hear the heartbeat for the first time it will hit you!|`|3gx5eXf5aa	when i was prego i did get sick at all i was lucky i guess maybe you will get lucky too my daughter is VERY HEATH LY LOL congrats and good luck|`|sxecXFgraa	I was on the pill when I got pregnant with my first and I had no complications at all (my due date with her was 22Oct and she was born on 19Oct).  I didn't feel pregnant with her until she started moving around and then everything changed, morning sickness for the rest of the pregnancy.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	I never had morning sickness or sore breasts!
Gn4iNKPSaa	Yes My twins have been doing the same and it was caused from teething and of course a growth spurt, so now before i put them to bed i make sure they have full bellies and i do the same  all day and that has seemed to help.But sometimes they just need to be held and that's ok but try not to put who evers up in bed w/ u that will cause problems dwn the road. She needs to learn how to put herself back to sleep. I know this is challenging when they share a room and don't want the other to wake. Try increasing food during the day and lots of interaction and play time decrease naps and if she still wakes up then pick her up and comfort and put back dwn before she falls asleep and if she crys again just keep doing this and she will soon understand. Good luck and i hope i helped.Your definitely not alone.|`|swuIPk3kaa	i had my daughter in my bed for the first six months she would not sleep in her cot untill i bought this book and followed the advice it really works and put my mind at rest about can you leave a baby crying and for how long, it saved my relationshiip "The Complete Sleep Guide For Contented Babies and Toddlers" by gina ford|`|qg2tNhcTaa	There is a method called "ferberizing".  I used this with my kids.  It involves a little of letting them cry it out.  It means you'll be a little stressed for the first couple of nights, but by night number three you should be making major headway.<br>  <br>  A link below to how it works or you can Google "ferberizing".<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  I know what it is like.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	try to figure out what has changed that has her waking up and go from there, teething, change of diet, routine, anything....|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	well, it's kinda hard because like you said she will wake the other kids, but my advice is to let her cry it out. she needs to learn to comfort herself back to sleep. babies naturally wake up a few times a night & if everytime she has to be held or get attention that is going to make it really hard on everyone. at 6-7 months its ok to let her cry it out. as long as she is fed, burped & dry & warm, no worries.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I read a great book, actually a couple of them....I will recommend them to you too....<br>  <br>  'On Becoming Baby Wise" by Gary Ezzo, M.A. and Robert Bucknam, M.D.<br>  'Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child' by Marc Weissbluth, M.D. <br>  'The No-Cry Sleep Solution' by Elizabeth Pantley. <br>  <br>  These are all very informational books....I used stuff from each one!  I wish you the best of luck!|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	try putting your perfum on her beding, and maybe get her a bear,  my daughter was the same way sleep all night from day one, than teething at 4 months, now i just spray a little of me on her beding and blanket  she missing you you are her comfort she feels safe with you|`|GJgZVKvXaa	Babies who used to sleep through the night but then stop might benefit from some form of sleep training.  Babycenter.com has some excellent articles about the different techniques you can use to help your baby learn to sleep through the night.<br>  <br>  Of course having twins makes your situation more complicated, but there is no reason you can't try sleep training your daughter.  If your son sleeps well and his only problem is his sister's crying wakes him - is there a different spot in your house he could sleep in that is quiet, while you try to solve your daughter's sleep problem?|`|VJnmHFR0aa	Mine did that, she was sleeping so well then out of the blue she started waking up around about three o'clock, she'd be awake for hours.  After about a week of this I rang the health visitor who suggested increasing her food, so I did.  Voila she was sleeping through again!
pXSKSS3daa	Sounds like an umbilical cord granuloma. My son has/had one of these and it was treated with silver nitrate as well. If it's still leaking I'd bring it up with her pediatrician. My son's belly button still looks weird but his doctor cannot do any more for him so he'll just have an odd looking belly button, I guess. It's not a HUGE deal, meaning it's not life threatening, but if it's still draining it may be infected. So get it checked out.<br>  <br>  Have you clipped her toenails yet? I noticed the other day Noah's toenail seemed to almost be growing into his skin. After I cut it there was an indent in his skin from it! I felt awful.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I have no idea if they can have ingrown toenails. I would ask a doc, if your doc looked at her belly button and didn't say anything about it then I would think that she would be fine. If you want you could just call up to the doc to ask them over the phone, I had the discharge but it went away, so I really don't know how worried you should be.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	Well, for the belly button, I can tell you that my daughter had a slight bit of leaking after the stump fell off, and the doctor cauterized it with silver nitrate.  It continued and they did it again.  It still continued and they did it a third time.  The doctor told me that it should stop after the first cauterization, and she had never seen it not stop after the second round.  She sent my daughter to have an ultrasound - this was 2 days after the initial silver nitrate treatment.  My daughter had what's called a patent urachas and a urachal cyst- basically, her bladder was connected to her belly button and urine and puss was leaking out.  It can be very serious if there's a cyst and it ruptures, the baby can die - take your daughter back in ASAP and ask about the possibility of a patent urachas - it's pronounced "pay-tent  yer-ay-cuss".  It's the most common cause for the symptoms you are describing.<br>  <br>  I don't know about the toenails, but my daughter's are really weird.  I'd ask your doctor.<br>  <br>  Edit:  also, my doctor said not to use neosporin on babies because it has a highly allergenic component - use triple antibiotic ointment if you are going to use anything, but she also stressed not putting that on the belly button even before she knew the diagnosis.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	My middle son's belly button did that and we went in for the silver stuff as well. it was fine after that, so i think i'd call the doc and see what he has to say about it. <br>  <br>  as for the ingrown toenails, i wouldn't worry about them right now. don't cut them too short and just watch it. my babies toes looked like that for a bit till they were sitting up and scooting around.|`|eu6UQElYaa	I think the belly button is probably fine.  It's not unusual for them to drain a bit even for several weeks afterwards.   It's extremely uncommon for belly buttons to become infected as long as you wash with a little soapy water she should be just fine.  Keep an eye on it of course, but it doesn't sound like really anything right now.   <br>  <br>  I took my son into his pediatrician because I thought he had ingrown toenails too.  His were doing the same thing you're describing.  She told me that it's normal and babies that young really can't get ingrown toenails.   So I'd say they are probably just fine as well.|`|yzakyjNKaa	id call the doctor and ask him  it shouldn't be doing that at that age neither of my kids belly buttons drained at all after theirs fell of or even before|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	i had this with my son. his fell of super early. scared the **** out of me. it drained for weeeeeks. all we did was clean it with a q-tip & alcohol-this will NOT hurt her. put neosporen over it & put a band aid on it. do this a couple times a day & it will heal in a few weeks.  :)<br>  <br>  yeah, babies toe nails can do that. i had to clip away some of my sons after he was 2 months old- on a few toes. is it swollen? pussing? red? does she act like it's hurting her? if not she is probably fine. they grow kinda funky at times.|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	I would check with your child's pediatrician about the belly button again before doing anything with it.  If you do put some neosporin on it I would just lightly tape some gauze over it so it can still breathe and the band aid doesn't get stuck on your little one's delicate baby skin.  As for the ingrown toenails, I'm not sure...I would ask your doc about that one, especially if it seems like it's hurting your kiddo.  And if it's red and swollen at all. Good luck!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	yes they can have ingrowns, and yes i would be concerned about the belly button; call the office, tell them all of this and see what they say; my dd's never did that, and if it is draining when she strains etc. it means the fluid is probably already there and being forced out, which isnt good; but if it isn't infected they may want to let it run it's course, but i would still call...
uiCR425Uaa	This really depends on dosage and your insurance. If you have no insurance, it retails around here (Maryland) anywhere from $50-$200 depending on the dosage. If you have insurance, review your insurance plan.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	call the pharmacy... recently so many pharmacies have antibiotics on thier $4 programs. If it is not on the $4 program they may be able to call your doctor and ask him to switch to something on the $4 program. Also, generics tend to be cheaper than brand name.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Call your pharmacy and ask.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	I have bcbs and I pay $10 for generics and $25 for name brand.  You might pay more if it augmentin isn't on their formulary list.  You'll probably pay between $10 - $40.  Your best bet is to call the pharmacy and ask them how much it will be before you fill the prescription.

I nursed my daughter until she was about the same age and it was actually because she decided one day that she didn't want to nurse anymore. The boy that i nanny was breastfed until he was older than 2. But towards the end, it was strictly when mom was around for comforting purposes. I would suggest that you firmly tell her NO when she hits, etc. and warn her of a time out. in a chair. With tantrums, tell her no, warn with time out and if it progresses, put her in her crib for a minute and walk out of the room. If she is this upset, she needs to calm down. Go back in her room after the  minute is up and ask if she's done throwing a fit. Wait for her to be done and let her out and explain why she got a time out. <br>  <br>  Do you spend a lot of time with her? Are you a stay at home mom? I am a SAHM, but I am also a nanny so when my daughter and i go to work, she doesn't always get my full attention. At home, sometimes if I leave a room, she cries and wants to be with me. I simply tell her that she can;t right now and I will be there in a minute. If the crying continues, I explain to her that we cry when we are hurt, not because we don't get what we want.My point is is that maybe you need some time away from her so you can get used to the idea of you not always being around. Good Luck!

She did. So apparently, from what I've been reading from the previous answers and what we saw with our neighbor, it's one of those things that seems to vary with each woman and pregnancy. I do know where you're coming from about feeling nervous and scared though. Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy and after.

4eXNT9mVaa	Your luteal phase begins when you ovulate and lasts until your next period starts.  A luteal phase that is too short can cause problems with becoming pregnant.|`|ddb42df2323d021e825dc1b4a61d8c46aa	This question doesn't sound dumb. most women don't know what the luteal phase of their cycle is.  This concerns your ovum after the Graafian follicle has ruptured. That is the point where your now mature egg is expelled out of the ovary. The sac that once carried that egg turns into the corpus luteum. This gives rise to the hormone progesterone, hoping that egg will be fertilized and lead to conception.|`|96866d4f832775ba118d3f84fc12dcbeaa	luteal phase<br>  –noun Physiology.<br>  a stage of the menstrual cycle, lasting about two weeks, from ovulation to the beginning of the next menstrual flow.

ckDkNGL6aa	I can totally understand where you are coming from.  This is a very dangerous situation.  You have no way of being sure about the car, and a child's safety should always take priority over anything else.  Avoiding putting your child in unnecessary danger to protect his is not something you are required to do, but I certainly agree that getting any info from the vehicle and reporting it to authorities a.s.a.p. is a very good suggestion.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	6 is not a toddler. its a 1st grader. my step daughter hasnt been in a carseat or booster since she was about 5 (but she is really big for her age) <br>  <br>  I probably wouldnt have said or done anything<br>  <br>  <br>  btw I knew a 2 year old who liked to start his mom's car, leaving the keys in the ignition was not a good idea.|`|op55FtqYaa	I would have taken his registration plate number, said nothing then called the police. <br>  <br>  I try not to say anything because when I know it'll cause a fight I can't handle. <br>  <br>  You just need to stay calm, note it down and then call the police as soon as he's gone.

MR9iBgafaa	She'll be fine.<br>  <br>  I put my baby in her own room at 3 months and she's fine. She's now 4.5 months and can roll over onto her front.  I was really worried in case she suffocates herself, so I kept her door open and her monitor (Toby) on.  <br>  <br>  As your baby is active that's actually better.  Cot death can be caused by your baby being smothered - unlikely as she can lift her head and move it.  The second cause is your baby's brain 'forgetting' to breathe as the reflex is missed. This is found in very young babies and isn't affected by being in their own room. The third cause is a lack of oxygen - possibly caused by sleeping in the same bed with the baby breathing its own carbon dioxide.  Again sleeping in Moses basket or in own room doesn't affect this.<br>  <br>  Your baby will be fine. I worried about this loads.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, keep that monitor on and the door open.|`|AA10077992	Of course - and she will probably sleep a lot better if she doesn't have to listen to your snoring !|`|FcHplZtQaa	your just panicking cause your used to her being in with you....<br>  <br>  the twins are 10mths and they've been in there own room since just before Christmas, and they're fine...<br>  <br>  stick a baby monitor in her room, that'll help keep your mind at rest|`|lzOqcGgUaa	my cousin leaves her 7-8 month old in a room alone to sleep?|`|7cf4b3bd36e805b27e9c6125e10e129aaa	if you're worried put her cot back in your room - why worry they're only babies for such a tiny amount of their little lives - make the very most of it - my kids are 19 and 22 and I let them sleep in my room if they wanted to - I don't care what people say - kids make up their own mind eventually.

I had my daughter in her own room at that age. She was fine|`|uRKZkBfjaa	Yes you are! She is just the right age to sleep in her own room. You seem to have covered all her needs and relax she will be fine. If you are worried about her moving in her sleep then remove her blankets and buy her a baby nest to sleep in, it's like a sleeping bag with arms, this will keep her warm and safe.<br>  <br>  You probably need to invest in a gate for her bedroom door though as she may soon realise how to climb out of her cot, both my children were in beds at 11 months as they liked to fling themselves over the top of the cot which was a lot further to fall than the floor! You can buy bed guards which work till they are competant at gettng in and out of bed.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your own space.|`|wxImZRssaa	Its ok to have them in their own room from 6 months onwards. After 6 months the risk of SIDS (cot death) is as low as for an adult (its called SADS for an adult though)<br>  <br>  Your panicking because your a mother its what we do.<br>  <br>  Back to your question though. Yes its safe to let her sleep in her own room. Use a baby monitor to keep your mind at ease.<br>  <br>  My daughter started sleeping in my bed when she was about 1 and a half, (she was in a cot in my room till then)  she's two tomorrow. <br>  <br>  I've made her bedroom really nice, but she refuses to sleep in there. If your daughters happy to sleep in her own room, I think you should think yourself lucky.<br>  <br>  I'm going to have a nightmare getting my daughter to sleep in her own room, I've left it too long.<br>  <br>  Your doing the right thing, at the right time.|`|cAVVX7BQaa	my son is in his own room since he was 5 months old.  You need to get a room thermometer, dont let her room get too warm or too cold, 19'c is ideal. if you worry that she will kick off her bed clothes like my son does, get a sleep bag for her in any baby shop. It will keep her warm and she wont be able to pull covers over her head. Just the bag is usually ok, you wont need blankets if the rooms at the right temp.<br>  She will be ok, leave her room door open so you can hear her. Its up to you but i always leave the hall light on|`|0nZrPxPeaa	Yes, you are panicking over nothing.  She is past the danger age for SIDS and since she can't climb out of her crib, she is perfectly safe.  A lot of babies sleep in their own room from birth.  Besides, if she gets used to you sleeping in her room, you'll never be able to get out of there.  And when you get her a real bed, she'll constantly be climbing into yours.|`|65813cab4a17ce78f8326ac2cf8b36b4aa	My son has slept in his own room since 8 weeks old so yes she is old enough. We have the monitor on for when where downstairs & when we go to bed we always check on him. If he wakes we always hear him. You tend to notice their cry/whimper even if its really quiet & sleep through thunderstorms lol. She'll be fine it will be harder for you to adjust to the new routine.|`|qR2G2WcMaa	yeah she will be fine, my daughter has been in her own room since she was 6 months, i keep the doors open a bit though and i have a baby monitor on so i can hear if she moves etc.. this gives me piece of mind, so if you're nervous get a baby monitor too xx|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	I think it is fine.  Gt a baby monitor and then you'll be able to hear her if she wakes up.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	It's fine. Doctors recomend that babies can sleep alone after 6 months...that's because SIDS risk is signifigantly lowered...it is fine...leave her door open and your own...that's what I do.|`|63a5d617239afd4f62c7622fb8d95be3aa	Its fine. My daughter has been in her own room since she was 7 months old. I just make sure she is asleep before I go to bed and that I have the baby moniters on during the night incase she wakes up so I can here her.
Wzws8v8daa	sorry honey but there is a good chance that you are NOT ovulating...  i'm going through this right now too.  i have irregular periods like that, and i went to my doctor after trying to get pregnant with no luck, and they did blood work and said i have a hormonal imbalance which is causing the irregular periods and also causing me to not ovulate.  i have to start taking Clomid which is a medicine that will make your body ovulate.  if i were you i'd go see a doctor!|`|stRWElvPaa	It may be due to a hormonal imbalance, has it ever happened before? I think you should stick to your usual cycle calculation and just assume you should be fertile 10 to 16 days after your period first started. how long are your cycles usually?

Name your kid based on its own unique qualities, or pick something standard like "Michelle" or "John" so it can fit in easily.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	I love the name Bailee!!  But Bailee Rae is kinda a mouthful.  I would go with Bailee Anne, or Bailee jade, or something like that.  But I do like it.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I like it. A lot.

I like unique names and my husband and I plan to name our children with unique names also. Just keep in mind that when you get older your tastes change and from personal experiance, you will probaby change these a million times!! lol I know I did before finally deciding with my husband on Chaston James for a boy (middle name is still debatable though on this one) and Bannon Elizabeth for a girl. Either way, never worry, whatever you pick out for your future children will be lovely and they will love it.|`|TQQwVTj3aa	It's nice to give names that you like, but really think on when they go to school when they start spelling there names and saying it and how other kids will pronouce it cause Desdemona would be pretty hard for a kindagarden to say it or so!

(:|`|35ff9d3ad1eb64812f64b2031173d7e4aa	Out of all of these, "Edward Tristan Caleb" is my favorite. The others sound more like they would be names for a character in a book (which isn't all bad, I love original character names, I just don't think that they would be fit for a child). Although by itself, I do like the name "Victoria".|`|z1YM1Xniaa	I would maybe drop one of the middle names. That is alot of names for just one child but they are also going to be hard for any 3 year old to pronounce. They may sound nice to you but your kid has to live with the name. I am not trying to sound mean or be mean. Just giving my opinion. <br>  <br>  I would try:<br>  <br>  Tom Salvador<br>  Tristan Caleb<br>  Narcissa Harriet<br>  Victoria Bellatrix<br>  <br>  Your still working with the same names, just on simpler terms. Good luck!|`|jtjISk6qaa	Desdemona Narcissa Victoria=NO<br>  Godiva Bellatrix Harriet= thats a chocolate, so big NO<br>  <br>  hate those names. the others are fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: i guarentee no one will think of "Lady Godiva" when they hear that name. they will think of chocolate, because Godiva is a brand of chocolate. how old are you anyway?|`|wdXQaATDaa	Eww...sorry but I don't like any of them...not to mention that I even pronounce some of them...what a pain!|`|BBLraJE3aa	Honestly I dnt think so & I'll try to explain why in the nicest way possible..Tom & Edward are common, bland and not nearly as unique as some of those other names you chose...Narcissa makes me think of a Narcissus, Harriet is old fashioned, Godiva instantly makes me think of lady Godiva & a woman riding naked on a horse, and Desdemona sounds like a fairy tale name and Bellatrix just sounds kind of too far out, & Victoria is common too, but sounds classy and descent..If you really like the names though, I say go 4 it..it's just my opinion?|`|8WbfmK5daa	I thought they were all boy's names until I saw Harriet and Victoria.<br>  <br>  Tom is ok.<br>  <br>  I love Caleb that is really cute.<br>  <br>  Can people answer mine please would like more opinions on it :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjUWYxonfC0ULpYl4D7cw_547hR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090227122144AApWIiv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Thanks|`|8KZ7HKgvaa	I actually really LOVE them <br>  I think they sound great together and 2 middle names are great!

d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	Please, do not circumcise your baby. It is not only unethical to do such a surgery to a baby that has no will and choice at that tender age.<br>  <br>  Millions of males are uncircumcised and they do not suffer one bit. God made us that way for a reason. The skin protects and makes it stay sensitive for this he will thank you when he is an adult.<br>  <br>  There is no proof or evidence that circumcision is a positive thing. If you do your research you will see that it does not even help. The skin secretes an oil that helps with the penis, it has a function. Please, do your own research...not just seeing from youtube. How would you feel if you were circumcised as a female? It does happen in some countries and it is just as horrible.<br>  <br>  If you really think you will circumcise your baby then at least let him make his choice when he is older and has a thinking mind and own will.<br>  <br>  I can not believe how many people post so many idiotic things like "he has less chance to get HIV!" of course he has less skin obviously! or like "He has less chance to get cancer and get infected" --- How about we just chop the whole thing off then there will be zero chance of cancer! Or the best one yet, "I think it looks ugly" --- Well, how about you look yourself in the mirror and see your own self esteem and how you judge people by outer beauty than what is inside.

Why do I say this?! Is because my friends who had a boy a while a go said that I should get the baby circumciced because she didn't for her boy, and her boy now doesn't let her clean his wee-wee while a white dirty clay keeps getting arounds his penus...|`|eU5Eth2aaa	My husband and I were just talking about this.  I needed his help deciding, because as a soon to be mother, the last thing I want is my child to have a procedure like that done.  I really wanted a mans opinion and I wanted to know the pros and cons.<br>  <br>  My husband said that he knew a few kids in high school that were not circumcised.  They all played football and he said that the guys that were not wished they were.  They said it was kind of embarrassing.  My husband also mentioned that when you are not circumcised that it is alot harder to keep the penis clean.  There is so much extra skin and folds that have to be cleaned in and around.  The last thing he mention was that intercourse could be more uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  If I have a boy I definitely want to have him circumcised.  I know they are sweet babies at first, but one day they will be young men.  I don't want my decision of not wanting to get it done to effect him later in his life.<br>  <br>  Maybe talk to your partner or the child father about this like I did with my husband.

The benefits do not outweigh the risks. One analysis found that for every 9 boys who might be spared a UTI by circumcision, another 12 boys at the least (the upper estimate was 40 boys) will experience severe complications from the circumcision. Thats great if your boy is one of the 9, but horrible if he's one of the 12. UTIs can be treated by antibiotics quite effectively. Botched circumcisions are much more difficult to fix. Its also worth noting that 99% of intact boys will never get an infection, compared to 99.9% of cut boys. That means you would have to cut 100 boys to save just one of them from infection. Thats 99 boys cut for no reason at all. Out of every 1000 boys who are cut, one will contract a UTI anyway.<br>  <br>  Only 50% of boys nationwide are circumcised. Girls of your son's generation will likely have an entirely different view of circumcision as girls from yours. Just because you think intact is "gross" and "unsanitary" does not mean the women of your son's generation will. after all, think of all the differences between you and your parents. Did you know that when your grandparents were young, circumcision was very uncommon?<br>  <br>  Next, it is VERY painful to an infant. Most doctors still don't use any anesthesia, those that do rarely offer adequate anesthesia because the only stuff that works is not safe enough to use in infants for such a "minor" procedure. Further, some of the pain meds offered to infants aren't even recommended for use on babies! Some doctors argue that it has been done "for thousands of years" without anesthetic- what they neglect to tell you is that a medical circumcision can take over 15 minutes to complete. A Jewish ritual circumcision, by contrast, takes under 60 seconds to complete (and the baby is given wine) Here is some info on the pain.....<br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.circumcision.org/response.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cirp.org/library/pain/taddio2...</a> (note in this one that even infants offered pain meds for the procedure showed signs of post traumatic stress!)<br>  <br>  You should also know that studies have shown that the most sensitive parts of the male anatomy of ON the foreskin- NOT the head of the penis. By cutting off the foreskin, you remove a mans most erogenous genital tissue. Here is a study about that.... (note that other studies found no difference, but they neglected to test the sensitivity of the foreskin- they only tested the glans penis of intact and cut men and didn't pay any attention to the foreskin at all) <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchte...</a><br>  <br>  You should know that infant boys are EASIER to care for when they are intact. The foreskin does not retract until late childhood or even puberty, so you do nothing special, just wipe the outside of his penis clean and leave it alone. Furthermore, to prevent painful and bleeding erections later in life, doctors are now commonly leaving more skin behind- in a cut boy this means you may have to push the left over skin back at every diaper change and clean beneath it to prevent it from adhering or infecting. The very thing that mother's think they avoid by circumcising! In short- Intact = wipe like a finger, NEVER retract Cut= vaseline, clean thoroughly, push back remaining skin to prevent adhesions etc (the last step perhaps for several months or years)<br>  <br>  Here is an excellent tutorial on the basics of intact care and circumcision....<br>  <a href="http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lactivistintactivist.com/?pag...</a><br>  <br>  Another factor in your decision is that circumcised boys experience a 12% increase in their risk of MRSA infection. MRSA is commonly picked up in hospitals (where circumcision is performed in non-sterile conditions) and has been known to kill adults. I wouldn't want to deal with it in an infant. 12% is a BIG risk, the risk of a boy "needing" a circ later in life is WELL below that- under 1%. <a href="http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers..." rel="nofollow">http://www.nocirc.org/publish/12-Answers...</a><br>  <br>  The so called "benefits" of circumcision are generally trumped up. A big one now is that it "prevents" AIDS. All the studies showing "benefits" like this have been poorly designed and inconclusive. Also, for every study that finds a "benefit" there are more studies that find no benefit. <a href="http://www.icgi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.icgi.org/</a><br>  <br>  It is rather eye-opening to see how circumcision first became popular in the US to begin with.

It cuts down on his risk of yeast infections, urinary tract infections and they are not self conscious about it.  It is more sanitary and I know you can teach him how to clean properly but little boys don't seem to pay attention to detail.  <br>  <br>  Just remember that it is a personal decision and no one can make it for you. Also really take the father's opinion into consideration.|`|HXh7u0lEaa	I have 2 boys the 3rd on the way, my 2 boys are 3 and 17 neither are circumcised. I researched into it, apparently circumcision works well if your son is prone to UTI otherwise they are more likely to get an infection from the operation it's self. I decided that if my sons wanted it done then it would be up to them - or if they were getting infections. Neither of them have ever had an infection and as long as they keep everything clean it's very unlikely they will. There is some suggestion that you are less at risk from catch HIV if you are circumcised which could sway the argument, but it does not give you 100% protection against it and I think that for safe sex you need to use a condom uncircumcised or not. <br>  <br>  I have never heard anyone say that it is embarrassing not to have it done and when it comes to sex an erect penis looks the same anyhow.  I don't think most women care whether their man circumcised and not - it's not one of the questions you ask your man on a  date.<br>  <br>  p.s you never ever pull a young boys skin back to wash it, it can cause it to tear , the skin comes back later on in his life.|`|44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	I had my first boy circumcised. I think it was the best choice. It's really hard to clean the penis properly either as a baby, child or adult if you have the for-skin from what I've read. Causes alot more infections and even uti's in men. So with all that I decided that I would go the circumcised route. Haven't regretted it ever. <br>  <br>  Although I think it's kinda a personal decision that you just kinda have to make. I mean I don't think it will make that much of an impact either way. Only difficulty is if the boy didn't get it done as an infant and had to have it done as an adult or wanted it done as an adult the pain would be ALOT more than as an infant.|`|GVuZG3hIaa	We had our older son circumcised.  It was traumatic to send him away to have it done, and the doctor looked at me like I was nuts for asking if they could put a local anesthetic on him!  Well, I'm pregnant again, and we would NOT be circumcising this child if it was a boy.  As you probably know, circumcision is becoming less and less popular, and there is no real reason to do it.  The funny thing is, the only people who can give you a preference one way or another is grown men, and they are always happy with what they have, and think it's best, no matter if they're circumcised or not!  If you don't want to do it, don't do it.  By the time he's older, he'll be in good company, since 50% of US baby boys aren't circumcised.|`|AA11208683	i was wondering the same thing after i found out it was boy, but my husband wants it circumcised, he thinks its disgusting not to but that his opinion... and no there are no real proofs, although it is easier to clean when he is circumcised.... if he doesn't ever wash down there and keep it clean he will get infections but if he learns right away then it will be fine... and yes the video probably did make it look horrifying but its not that bad really. my mom is and RN in the OB and NICU and she says that they cry for a little bit but after they don't even realize it plus it heals in 5 - 7 days. but if your son hates it when he gets older its going to be a he** of a lot more painful then for him to get it removed plus he will have to be put under and he will remember it... there are different disputs about doing it and not doing either way there is a possibility it could be harmful to the baby... i have a book that talks about it but its kinda long... if you want any more info just email me or something. good luck...|`|chmuDZObaa	There have been studies that show uncircumcised men can be *slightly* more at risk for HIV but it is a very small percentage and that is what condoms are for!

That is why there is still such a huge debate over it.|`|GB1f4sEEaa	I've done a lot of online research on infant circumcision because of the debate. It has been proven that the supposed health benefits are less than the possible complications from circumcision. <br>  <br>  Think about it realistically. The forskin on an infant is complety attached to the head of the penis and fecal matter and urin cannot get under the forskin. Now think about an infant who was circumcised, there is a wound that is exposed to fecal matter and urine and there is a greater risk of infection in circumcised infants than noncircumcised infants.  Doesn't make much sense does it? <br>  <br>  Also, doctors these days are leaving more skin because for decades too much skin was removed and a great number of adult men suffered complications when erect because of the skin being too tight, they suffered painful erections and even bleeding because the skin pulled too tight and ripped.<br>  <br>  And since doctors are now not taking off so much skin, the parents have to perform extra cleaning on their circumcised sons. There is a very high chance that if not cared for properly the remaining skin will attach to the head of the penis and will require further surgery later. <br>  <br>  Besides the debates about health benefits, there are some serious possible complications from circumcision, the worst of them are loss of the glans(head of the penis), loss of the entire penis and even death. Those complications are rare, but I ask you how you could take a chance of ruining your son's manhood for life by having an non-medically necessary procedure performed on him.

However, I have 3 nephews (all circumcised) and I am a Registered Nurse on a High-Risk Perinatal unit. My advice is to do the circumcision. First of all, I will start by saying that you should never make your medical decisions based on a YouTube video. You need to get reputable & legitimate advice. Of course, there are "horror" stories of circumcisions just as any surgery.

Well I asked my Aunt who is a doctor that delivers babies recently. She said she still does circumsions but she asks that the parents think it over and make sure they really want to do it. She said there is absolutely no medical evidence to support it being done. She also told me had she known what she does now that she wouldn't have had her own son done years ago. She said that as long as the parents clean the penis well and teach the child too then there is no issue. It doesn't put a man at risk for STD's but that unprotected sex in general does. She said a baby girl has many creases and such that have to be properly cleaned by parents and then taught to the girl as she grows so there is no difference. If a baby girl was to have excess skin removed from her genitals (which is done she said in some countries) it is seen as genital mutilation. What is the difference? She told me that primarily the only benefit is cosmetic appearance. To be the same as the baby's father. And also religious beliefs. She said there are a few cons those being...it is surgery and there are always risks with infection and delayed healing, sometimes the skin reattaches itself during the healing process and creates issues and has to be redone (this has happened to my cousin's baby now he has to have it repeated when he is 2), possible nerve damage (especially if the doctor isn't good and how do you know if they are), and she said there is some evidence of potty training issues with circumsized little boys. She said it isn't proven yet but that they believe it has something to do with the nerve endings.<br>  <br>  She told me that she tells all parents having little boys to think about it and if they have any doubt don't do it because it can't be undone but it can be done later in life. She said yes they will remember it being done if they are older but we don't take every newborns tonsils or appendix's out (there is no real known function of these) just because it could cause a problem later in life and they won't remember it as a baby. So she views it the same way. She said she is seeing less and less baby boys getting it done. <br>  <br>  I am still on the fence about the subject if we ever have a boy but she gave me some real information.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|K4zsztkRaa	Honestly I believe the only time circumcision is a good thing is when it's chosen by the person that the penis is attached to. <br>  <br>  I have never seen any evidence that suports it's the better choice because it's purely cosmetic and nothing else.<br>  <br>  <br>  But also that's for each individual person to decide on their own. <br>  Only the guy can decide if the benifits out weigh the cons.<br>  <br>  Like me for example, I don't care if circumcision gave you 10 more years to live, I still wouldn't be circumcised.<br>  It's a personal prefrence for each man.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Not really. Yeah it can prevent foreskin problems, but those are rare, minor and usually easily treated (e.g. with oral antibiotics and a cream). AFAIK most intact guys never have a problem with their foreskins. I think it's wrong to remove a body part before any problems ever arise. We don't do it with tonsils or appendices.<br>  <br>  Some people say it prevents UTIs in the first year of life but the study on that is old and flawed, not to mention circumcision is more painful and risky than a UTI! And very rare in boys any way.<br>  <br>  Some other people say it prevents STDs but the latest study on that showed no difference between the circumcised and intact group. Everybody needs to use condoms regardless of if they are circumcised or not so it doesn't make any practical difference. Besides, I think it's wrong to assume a boy will be stupid and promiscuous.<br>  <br>  So I wouldn't do it if I had a son and I would encourage you not to either.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|s1utniuvaa	I got it done for my son and if I have another son I will be getting it done. The decision for us is based on hygiene as well as the discomfort he may go through later if he has it done. On the note of hygiene, sure while he is little we would clean the area for him but children of a certain age have a hard time cleaning some areas and at say 5 years old I doubt he would be comfy with mommy cleaning there... even my 5 yo daughter doesn't want me to make sure it is clean but she doesn't have much of a choice. As to the getting it done later... I knew someone who was so embarrassed by his penis because his parents didn't have him circumcised that he got it done in his 20's. He was in so much pain and with the swelling he couldn't walk very well. I don't want that for my boys...|`|dsf5hGGnaa	I will be getting my baby circumcised if it's a boy.  I just think it looks better and honestly I know how girls are and would never want him to be embarrassed. That's my opinion not asking for thoughts lol.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Don't do it.  No real reason, keep him clean, teach him to stay clean, he will thank you for it as an adult.
af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	nope this just happened to my friend she was due this week and the doc told her to just go back home and wait till monday (her next appt). and shes fine so far nothing can go wrong, if it was otherwise your doctor wouldnt have sent you back  home. if something was going wrong and your baby was in danger and needed  to be born on that date they would have enduced you. thats what happend to me with my first pregnancy my water broke 3wks before i was suppose to deliver and i was getting no contractions so they enduced me but even then i had a perfectly healthy now 2and a half yr old daughter,, good luck!!|`|eu6UQElYaa	Are you in labor?   If not then you have nothing to worry about.  If you go into labor in the next 5 days call the on call doctor and go to the hospital.|`|G4qP2gATaa	No... unless you go into labor before then, then you cant wait.|`|OiFNZnwOaa	No there is nothing to worry about going overdue, i went 10 days overdue with my first, you are just not supposed to go 2wks over..<br>  although i dont know why your doc would expect you to wait, if you r body is ready and you go into labor, no one will stop u :-)|`|rdpZrBc9aa	The baby will come when it chooses to, but they don't usually let you go more than two weeks late.<br>  <br>  Babies can't read calendars!|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	of course not. A due date is an expected date, not an expiration date. I|`|gYkQc8Lraa	no. but if you go thru labour, contact the hospital|`|8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	No harm in waiting.  Unless you're in labor, you're waiting anyway.  However . . . don't allow your doctor to allow you to go more than ten days past your due date.  And if he/she wants to induce/augment with Cytotec (alsco called Misoprostil), tell them NO WAY.  (Look up Tatia Oden French and you will understand).<br>  <br>  In short, get some ice cream, get the clicker, watch some movies and relax until he gets back.  <br>  <br>  Is it a boy or a girl?  (I'm betting boy.)|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	no lots of people go 2 weeks over their due dates. your fine, you'll just be uncomfortable for the next few days!! :)|`|yrF1q1mdaa	No, you'll be fine unless you go into labour. My mom has me 3 weeks late !|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Nope.
yrDqtazLaa	That's the baby.|`|utfoP7GWaa	Yes, it's normal. I quit laying on my stomach not long after I found out I was pg b/c it got so uncomfortable (almost like I had a baseball or something in there!)|`|VJs1jZJ1aa	Before my stomach "popped out" and started getting bigger, it did feel funny when i layed on it or pushed on it. It kind of felt crowded, or like i was stuffed. Its just your body has to make room for your growing uterus, placenta, and baby. Its fine to lay on your stomach. Enjoy it while you can because eventually you will be to big to even try and lay on your stomach.|`|zBz10IiOaa	very normal hun it is your uterus|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Yes its normal.|`|AA10447831	yep|`|sRy2SKpXaa	Actually, you CAN lay on your stomach, and it won't harm the baby. But as you grow and get bigger, it'll be quite uncomfortable to do, so don't listen to these people saying you can't. When I was pregnant with my 3 year old son the only way I could sleep was on my stomach, and I did so until I was 7 months along, and he's just fine! And as for the feeling, im sure it's just your uterus growing.|`|44ccf078ecbbb80711e26204438034abaa	Your uterus gets like a ROCK when you are pregnant. It's usually a softer and nice organ. So yea it feels different and you are sensing that it doesn't feel as it use to. Perfectly normal. Don't worry you aren't causing the baby any harm. For that matter its worse to lay on your BACK than your stomach cause you cut off blood flow when you get further along cause you compress that vessel in your back. Sure that pry won't do any damage either but neither one is going to hurt your baby. Being on your stomach will eventually get VERY uncomfortable like you are sleeping on a board with a big huge bump in it! LOL!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|AA11208683	like armywife said, it is perfectly fine to lay on your stomach you just will get uncomfortable when you are farther along, especially if you grow fast, it will feel like you are laying on a watermelon which usually isn't comfortable lol. and it might be in your head and it might not be, most likely its not, but it depends on how far along you are. i knew i was pregnant just because my body felt weird and i actually felt pregnant and i took a test and i was. its just a women intuition or however you spell that.... and its not a stupid question, like you said your new at this.... everything will be different. congrats and good luck!|`|hoOaPYoWaa	Mostly it is all in your head....(no meant to sound mean).  It is your boby telling you that there is a person in there now and that by laying on your stomach it is pushing the baby towards your bladder.  Best for you to get comfortable laying on your side now.
P0Fjh59Eaa	Well i'd have to think about that actually! i have 4 kids, so ill just give you a run down of the starter supplies i got and then how much food, diapers and clothes i bought in ONE months time for just ONE child.<br>  <br>  starter stuff-<br>  <br>  12 oneses- pack of 4 cost $8<br>  12 pack of socks- $4<br>  12 jumpers 3 pack of jumpers-$8-$12<br>  12 footless sleepers, 3 pack of footless sleepers- $8<br>  4 blankets- $10 a piece<br>  12 recieving blankets i used as burp clothes, 4 pack-$8-$10<br>  baby nail clippers-$2<br>  snot getter (that blue thing you suck snot out of noses with)-$1<br>  Crib-$400<br>  dresser-$250<br>  change table-$250<br>  towels-$10 for nice ones, $3 for regular towels (which i prefer)<br>  baby hangers- 6 pack-$4<br>  baby tub (if wanted)-$12-15<br>  Stroller-$150-$350<br>  portable travel crib-$150-$250<br>  Carseat-$60-200, plus a forward facing seat at age 2 $100-$300, and finally a booster chair for older child, around $40-$80<br>  <br>  <br>  The occasional purchases-<br>  baby tylenol-$10<br>  baby motrin-$10<br>  mylicon-$10<br>  baby lotion-$5<br>  and other medications- orajel, teething tabs, teething rings, little noses, little tummies (and all medications w/the brand name Little _fill in the blank_)- ranging in price from $2-$10<br>  toys during age appropriate times- anywhere from $5 to $40<br>  Clothing purchased every other month or every 4 months during growth spurts-$150-$300<br>  <br>  monthly purchases-<br>  Diapers- 4-6 packs of diapers per month- $10-$15 a piece<br>  Baby shampoo-$5 a bottle<br>  Baby wash-$5 a bottle<br>  Baby food- usually 50-60 cents per jar, when buying around 12-14 jars twice a month<br>  baby cereal-$2-4 per box<br>  baby juices-$5 for a 4 pack <br>  baby snacks-$2-4 per box<br>  <br>  Perscription medications when sick-<br>  yearly around $50-$150<br>  <br>  and omg there's just so much more when you consider trips needing extra things like smaller travel strollers, diaper bags, special snacks that are travel size or packaged better for travel, shoes when they start walking and it's cold (mine dont wear shoes in the summer unless we are at the park), replacement toys that get lost, replacement socks that get eaten in the dryer, LOL, birthday gifts, holidays, etc.<br>  I don't even want to think about how much i've spent on my 4 children over the last 13 yrs! i just might pass out!<br>  <br>  oh btw- i didn't include formula which might be around $150-$200 per month, because i breast fed mine...so should i have included my own nursing clothes? oh well.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Children only cost as much as you let them cost. If you shop sales and buy store brand diapers your yearly diaper and wipe cost could be less than $500.<br>  <br>  If you are on WIC for formula and medicaid for health insurance and you use all hand-me-down free baby clothes, toys, and furniture, your cost for a year could easily be below $1000.<br>  <br>  Or your cost for a year could be over $20,000. You can easily waste a ton of money on designer junk for your kid.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	there are plenty of baby sites that tell you what to expect as far as diaper usage, food eaten, etc...so DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I spend $40 a month on just diapers so that would be $480 a year then for food I spend about $50 a month for formula then when she get's on baby food that will add about another $40 a month so about $90 a month which would be $1080 a year. On clothes I spend about $600 to $700 a year for three kids. I would say for the newborn I spent about $2000 to $3000 for the first year. I have only bought one crib for $350 that I have used for all three of my kids. I bought a rocking chair for $80 and a bassinet for $150. Hope that helped!!|`|Ks7lENScaa	A lot.  I cant give a exact number.  But I will just say what I have spend so far and my son is 4 months old.  For daycare I will spend $6435 this year.  Now for formula the kind I use cost about $25 a can.  I say I buy about 4 of these a month.  Now pampers can range from $7 a pack to about $29 depending on the size you buy.  Clothes it depends on what you buy.  That is similar to adults just you buy more often because kids grow fast.  To make my answer shorter I will say I probably already spend alot before he even got here let alone after. Strollers can range $100-300. (maybe more)  Cribs $100-500 (maybe more) it depends on style and where you get it.  But it is all worth it.  What you get in return has no price to it.|`|X6as2nOAaa	In the first year I would guess $5,000.00. That is my guess some less some more. My daughter eats about 2-3 jars of food a day, which are about 0.50 a jar. so that would be about 1.50 a day, 7 days a week, she drinks about 9 cans of formula a month which are almost 14.00 a can. Diapers she goes through about 80 diapers in 3 weeks. Clothes I have spent about 400.00 on clothes. I had a lot given to me by my sister though. That doesn't include, her bottles, her binki's, her baby bath tub and wash, wash cloths, lotion, medicine if she needs it. Her walker, crib was 200.00 with a changing table and a dresser I got a good deal. Bottle scrubbers, wet wipes, her swing, her mattress for the crib and her bedding for the crib, alone cost about 100.00, her toys and her toy boxes, she has a little chair for her, she also has a play pen and the diaper bags, her shoes, her hair things, her comb and brush, her blankets, her stroller and she has the car seats which you they grow out of, so I have two of them. Which cost about 150.00 for the car seat and the stroller the other car seat alone costs about 100.00. She has a lot more too so maybe it is more the 5 grand.|`|YJNql5Mgaa	Well my daughter is only 5 months, so I can only give you what I know...<br>  <br>  A box of diapers (where I'm from) is 20 bucks and I buy a box probably ever 2-3 weeks. Roughly.<br>  <br>  Formula (since medically, I can't breastfeed) is about 150 dollars, about a month at a time.  Bottles can also be around 5-15 dollars, depending on if you buy one, or a set. Or even more money.<br>  <br>  Clothes, are bought when needed, which isn't too often, since I got a bunch at the baby shower.  But clothes can range from 3 dollars (on clearance or garage sale) to 80 dollars.<br>  <br>  Stroller, car seat, and base... our's was 300 dollars.  A bassinet was 30 at a garage sale.  The pack and play was about 100 dollars.  We've got to buy a crib in a couple  months and the one I like is about $250.<br>  <br>  What you should really do, is go to Babies and Toys R Us and add up all the prices of things you'd need.  Don't forget to put in hospital bills.|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	babys are expenseive special today with price going up, my sister is having a baby anyday now and wow, crib, bed, basnet, blanks sleepers onces,socks bibs, outfits, soaps, lotions, car seat stroller play pen changeing table, wipes, diapers bottles binks, i would say at the lowest 6,000.00 dollars, maybe more just in furniture, and clothes and dipears well 2 packs a week 40 dipears in each pack cheap dipears your looking at 20.00 a week time 4 and thats if the don't get dirreha, and water for the fomula oh and fomula for on 12 oucnce can can run 6-9 dollars times that by 4-6 cans a week times 4 times a year well lets just say alot|`|8fiIbUHjaa	Well speaking from experience I just had my 1st child and I've pretty much spent a good penny on him. I would say there is not a price tag on how much you have to spend but lets talk about it for a bit. First you must buy a baby crib that will satisfy your needs so you have to be very picky, Second diapers diapers diapers. Most of the money goes into diapers at all cost then Third comes the baby's milk lol MILK for baby is EXPENSIVE, baby toys for a certain age meaning your going to always be buying toys for the baby and the same as for baby's clothes. I thought me being a guy buying him clothes here and there would be enough but whenever I see something new for him I  buy it whether It's a new toy, pants, even a new bottle. Again putting a price tag on it to me would be a never ending number but if you would have to put a range I would have to say between $2000 - $5000 in 1 year. Also depending on your income that you make and what you can afford. Some parents want the best for there children in anything so they spend more money and some take advantage on sales to save some type of money when they do buy things for their children so you have to take that into consideration as well since store sales = saving $$$. Another important factor is paying those visits to baby's doctor which is a must and also those infamous hospital bills. Well I hope I shed some light into your project good luck to you.
BP5ykmAmaa	look in the directary for your area have a look at the churches listed, then call the number next to that church, <br>  have a date roughl yin mind of when you want your girls christened. then the church usually ask you to attend a meeting with the vicar and other parents who are having their kids christened. they will tell you what will happen. you can either have a private service, just for your family which is what we did as we hd over 60 people coming and we had our own vicar who was a friend , or you can have them christened during a normal sunday service. this is nice if you have a small family.<br>  then go get a christening outfit for each of your girls and of course one for yourself.<br>  you will need to tell the church who the god parents are oging to be in advance so have them sorted already too.<br>  then just turn up on the day and enjoy. we had a party after ours where all the family came and had a buffet and  few drinks. but thats upto you!<br>  hope that helps!<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: just for the record, we live 2 hours away from the church our son was christened at, we arent regular church goers and christenings are free in the uk.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	Go to your parish priest/minister/vicar after Sunday mass/service and ask them when a suitable date is.<br>  <br>  You normally have to go do it in your local church where you attend services.<br>  <br>  I didn't make it a big party day, a Christening is about a child receiving a sacrament, so I just invited a few people back to mine for a buffet lunch and tea/coffee.  Some people book a hall to hold a reception in, I suppose you'd need to do this if you want to invite lots of people.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***<br>  Just have to make another comment.  If it's a Catholic ceremony, the Godparent(s) - at least one- has to be a confirmed Catholic, and be over the age of 16.  You need at least one Godparent.|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	The best way is to go to a Sunday morning service at your local parish church and speak with the vicar afterwards. In my experience they were so welcoming but I did have to go ho her home a couple of times and have a chat about why I wanted to Christen my daughter. The best answer to give is they ask "why would a person want to Christen a child" is "why wouldn't they want to". They like that. You can't christen your child in any church that takes your fancy, it must be your parish church. The Godparents you chose should be baptised people but it doesn't matter which denomination. Baptism is free of charge but you should leave a donation in the collection box at the end.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	Well you need to discuss it with your minister/priest (depending on your religion).<br>  if you don't know him, he might not do it. To get your child christened you technically should be a church-goer. Most ministers need evidence that you at least believe in God before they will christen your child.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	Do any of your relitives attend church? I would start with one of them. I know that in my area you have to be a member to have your children christened in that church. I would get the invites after that and the dresses.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Well, ideally it's the one you attend!|`|758cDKEFaa	go to the church you wish to have the christening and get the phone number for the chruch or ask someone inside.<br>  then ask to book a christening and they will give you the dates and times that they have to offer you but choose a date that will allow you to get everything sorted in time.<br>  then once its booked make a list of friends, family and godparents so you know ow many invitations your going to need then then go buy some and write them out and send them off as soon as you can so people have time to let you know if they can make it or not.<br>  then start looking for the outfit you want your girls to wear.|`|fUC4wCCEaa	Here in Chicago they will Christen your baby at the Catholic church for $50 dollars.  I don't think my friend was a member, but she did start attending once she booked it, I think the father asked her too.  So I am not sure.<br>  Usually people have a party after wards, but if it is just for you and a small group of close family and friends you could probably just go out for lunch after wards.  <br>  And I think if you googled your area with the words "catholic church" or "lutheran church" and your zip something will pop up, I would call and leave a message if they don't answer.|`|1JGj56TFaa	Hi!  We had our little girl christened in December - the first thing you need to do is contact your minister and arrange a date.  Go along to church and speak to him or else give him a call.  Once that is organised you can choose godparents (if you want them) and send out invites to the people you want to attend.  With regards to the actual christening service, your minister will keep you right with that.  We are methodist and only had a few words to say back to the minister during the service. Most people have food etc after the church service.  Because our christening was so close to xmas, we just invited everyone back to our house for something to eat.  With our sons christening (4 years ago) we booked a function room in a local hotel and the hotel supplied food for guests.  Hope this helps!|`|xy0W50Lqaa	Oh dear! I remember saying the exact same thing to myself last year.<br>  I live in the Midlands.  <br>  Firstly I visited the church where I wanted my daughter christened.<br>  Secondly I was told by the church that I would have to attend 4 services before given a christening date.<br>  Thirdly because I moved from my local chosen church 4 years ago I needed to contact the vicar at my local parish and ask him to write a letter giving me permission to have my baby christened at the church I wished for.<br>  <br>  It took some time to sort out but I got there in the end!  Getting in touch with the vicar's of churches was the hardest part because I felt like a pest!  It is easier to go and visit and more polite I think.  Good luck|`|mqvxIgRdaa	happy planning

M1KYxcvSaa	Yes, full siblings are very close genetically.  Without having both men's DNA to compare, or knowing that they looking to differentiate between the father and uncle, then there's a good chance that the testing facility will name whichever man is tested as the father.  They really do need all the information when testing between close relatives.
vNP5nmiTaa	Hi. First off, the pelvic pain is unlikely to be an ectopic. Mostly because I am assuming you had intercourse 3 days ago or so, and you would not be symptomatic from an ectopic at that point. What causes the actual pain from an ectopic is the growing embryo where it does not belong. Secondly, Plan B is very effective if taken properly, which it sounds like you did. <br>  <br>  I am not trying to tell you NOT to seek medical help if you feel it necessary. If the pelvic pain is severe, or she has other symptoms like shoulder pain, get seen immediately. <br>  <br>  To sum it up:<br>  <br>  I do not think it is an ectopic, very unlikely given the time frame.<br>  I do think the Plan B will be effective, as you took it very early.<br>  I do think you should seek medical help if the problem persists. <br>  <br>  Rochelle, RN|`|vl0HWTDJaa	She's probably just paranoid, I thought I was pregnant the first time the condom split too, lol. Even if there was an ectopic pregnancy, the embryo would have to grow for a lot longer than 3 days to feel pain so that's really not the problem. It depends where you live about getting it checked - in some places the dctor would have the right to tell her parents but in most places that wouldn't happen, and I don't think you even need permission to see a doctor in the first place.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	If she is worried, she should go to the Dr for an exam. <br>  Doesn't matter how old she is, she can go to Planned Parenthood for an exam or her normal OBGYN.|`|Q05rrSX4aa	Its only been about 3-4 days since you had sex.....she couldn't be having an ectopic pregnancy yet, its too early to have symptoms yet.  The plan B is 76% effective.  have her take a pregnancy test when her period is due.  I doubt the cramping has anything to do with pregnancy, it could be the pill she took, or it could be her period is coming.  There is a chance that she could be pregnant, but it is not that great.<br>  <br>  Good Luck:)|`|guyoGcWsaa	Ok,<br>  You don't have to get your parents notified to go get checked.<br>  Plan B is not 100% accurate. The longer you take the less effective it is.<br>  I'm 25 wks pregnant. I took Plan B and obviously did not work for me. So if you have any concerns you should take her to get check ASAP|`|qKMph7KEaa	You must have bought the Plan B for her, because you have to be 18 to do so, and I'm not going to pick on y'all for sleeping underage, blah blah blah, that's not important right now.<br>  <br>  Let me reassure you by saying that she took it with plenty of time to spare, and that if it was an ectopic event, she wouldn't feel it until about 6-8 weeks.<br>  <br>  While Plan B is effective in 7 out of 8 pregnancies, she should still try a home pregnancy test in a few weeks if her period is late, but I think the two of you should be fine.  In the future, just be sure to use new condoms and store them properly, and this shouldn't be a problem again.<br>  <br>  In the event she should need an exam, it would depend on what state you live in, but most require girls under 18 to have a parent with them, so let's hope it doesn't come to that, right?
TVqXrOq2aa	The first "adult" food that I gave my daughter was chicken noodle soup, strained so it's less messy. The bits of chicken were small and soft enough and the noodles were perfectly fine as well. Any food that is soft should be just fine, just make sure the pieces are small enough for him. Place them on a plate for him and let him feed himself, that is the best way for him to learn.<br>  <br>  Try Strained veggie soup, Strained Chick noodle soup, cooked green beans , peas. Maybe even try itty bitty pieces of cut up lunch meat. My daughter had a hard time picking up bananas, but they are a great first food.|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	First is the child choking or gaging ? Some children gag on food they dont like.<br>  Try mashed potatoes ,gravy,mashed green bean ,peas,chicken noodle soaps,mashed veg soups|`|nkSRIq0Iaa	Well it sounds like you're doing everything right. No sane parent will want to give their kid food when they choke on it all the time. That's some scary business! <br>  Maybe try showing him how to chew his food? From the start I would always give my daughter a bite of food and tell her " make sure you chew" and make the chewing motion. It just happened to sound like " nie nie nie" and now that she is a little older I ask her is she is hungry and she smiles and says nie nie nie. <br>  We also taught her how to cough on cue. So if she starts to swallow a piece of food and choke, she can usually cough it up by herself.<br>  I hope these tips helped!|`|8AmMlAZYaa	just follow his cues when he is ready he'll let you know don't worry about what other people say every child is different. Oh and 1 good piece of advise my mom gave me you have to choose your battles and believe me you'll have battles way worse than this:) but hang in there. just the fact that you are asking shows your doing great.|`|D8vOpNWgaa	i would say make the 2nd foods more chunky. add the baby otmeal till he gets used to it more. for my son the nibbler worked wonders you can put the solids in it and the can bit or suck on it to get the food out. was wonderfull for teething to for frozin fuits.|`|0nZrPxPeaa	Since his teeth came in late, it sounds like he is really not ready for table food.  It doesn't matter, he can still eat pureed food for awhile, it isn't necessary for him to be self-feeding already, as long as you have patience to still feed him.  If he is asserting independence and wants to feed himself, you will have to let him.  Chop the food into really tiny pieces, you might even have to break cheerios in half.  First try only putting one piece at a time on his tray and make sure he has swallowed before giving another so he doesn't have too much in his mouth.  And you'll probably have to still with foods like applesauce and mashed potatoes for awhile.  If you're still having problems and he is still gagging after a few weeks, call your pediatrician.  It is unlikely, but your son might have some sort of problem with food textures.
Fh4B88ZGaa	No, three months is not a long time. If you are under 35, you should try for a year before seeking medical advice.|`|H74F8jxuaa	One year is considered a long time.  My dr. told me that most healthy couples with get pregnant in the first year of trying.  After that, there may be something hindering a pregnancy.  Your doctor probably won't even see you until you have been trying for a year.  Keep trying and don't give up!  Some of us takes longer to get pregnant than others.|`|wOyyZjY0aa	Nope...three months is nothing.  With my daughter (3yrs ago), we decided we wanted to start trying and bang....that month I got preg.  Now TTC baby # 2, it's been a year.  Both me and my husband are healthy, it's just all up to our bodies and the timing.  My doctor told me that even if you do everything 100% right and hit ovulation right on the head, you still only have  a 25% chance of conceiving that month.  Some people do get preg right away but others it takes time.  85 % of couples with conceive in the first year.<br>  Kind-of crappy, but what can we do.  It will happen when it happen.  I'm not sure what you have been doing, but there are tons and tons of things you can do to help better your chances.  Ovulation kits, tracking, temps, Preseed....the list goes on.  If you need add't info on this stuff, please ask.<br>  Best of luck and it will happen.|`|stRWElvPaa	not at all, in any given cycle a woman in her 20's has only a 20-25% chance of conceiving. <br>    If you are in your early 30's it's even lower. <br>    Only around 50% of couples conceive within 6 months I think, and 85% in a year.<br>    So just keep trying every month and be as aware as possible of your fertility signs. <br>    good luck!!|`|oiJITSNZaa	I know TTC can seem like forever when really its not. Three months is a very short time. Your chances of conceiving are less than 25% each month. It is common advice to wait at least a year before getting worried. Even doctors won't look at you till you've been trying at least that long. So no don't worry yet!|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	It might depend on your age, but it doesnt seem like a long time at all. you should speak to your doctor about it when i spoke to mine about wanting to have another one he right away threw a bunch of options at me on how to conceive faster. good luck! tons of baby dust your way!
AA10247494	I just had my ultrasound done a week ago (I'm 9 weeks) and I had the same discomfort and even some brown discharge too. I called my doctor two days afterward and he said that everything was fine. If the discharge isn't red (indicating spotting and a possible miscarriage) or there isn't a lot of it everything is ok. He told me if I didn't have any more pain and the discharge stopped then not to worry. <br>  <br>  Congratulations btw and good luck! :D|`|AA10458750	Sometimes Drs. don't know what they are doing.....the transvaginal usually doesn't cause bleeding unless she didn't put enough lube or something. Do you bleed after sex? If so, then it may just be your body's reaction. I'm sure your baby is ok =)|`|GZn5VNlSaa	NO the ultrasound won't harm the baby.<br>  You're bleeding from the jolting you got in there. <br>  As long as you have your symptoms and you get no further spotting or cramping everything should be okay.<br>  Don't stress.|`|j7fzuDxgaa	i should think you are fine, im sure if you was miss carrying you would bleed more heavy not just a little on wiping, but call your midwife just to put your mind at rest|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Your fine, internal exams can cause some spotting.|`|LggMpuQIaa	no its normal. I had this happen too!!!|`|rzf4tMXGaa	No, the ultrasound can cause a miscarriage.  That's the same way I felt when I got a pap smear, because it also caused cramping.  I think you should see a doctor only if the discharge continues, and is accompanied by strong cramps. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|pBJb8sTZaa	Did the doctor do some other tests along with? That can cause spotting too.
soFpywFcaa	well you would need to know the first day of last period and the length of your cycle like mine is 28 days and  you start from the first day of your period and i should  ovulate on the 14 day|`|H74F8jxuaa	You should go buy the Answers brand ovulation predictor kit with 20 strips in it and start taking them tomorrow around lunch.  I recommend opk's because it will tell you when you are ovulating.  There are only 5-6 days out of the month that can lead to pregnancy from intercourse.  There is only a 20% chance of getting pregnant each month, so you have to time intercourse just right in order to get pregnant.  If you go to www.fertilityfriend.com, they have a free course that shows you how to chart properly.  It helped me learn a lot.|`|wNLmGzSwaa	Ask your mother to take you to the doctor. S/he will be able to explain the whole thing.<br>  <br>  By the time you're pregnant, the "good time" is generally over.|`|TanepNjdaa	In order to get pregnant, a sperm must meet and fertilize an egg, so any factors that affect this also affect your fertility. These include: the timing of ovulation, how long the egg lasts, whether there are any sperm present and how long sperm can live inside you.<br>  <br>  Women who have regular periods can easily calculate when ovulation occurs. Ovulation almost always happens 14 days before you expect your period. For a woman who has 28 day cycles, that would be in the exact middle of the cycle, 14 days after the last period and 14 days before the next one. Women who have 30 day cycles can expect to ovulate 16 days after the last period, which is 14 days before the next one.<br>  <br>  Women who have irregular cycles cannot predict when they will ovulate. In retrospect, they can calculate that ovulation occurred 14 days before a period, but that does not help in planning a pregnancy. Women with very irregular cycles may need to use ovulation predictor kits to determine when they will ovulate. Ovulation predictor kits detect the rise in hormones that occurs before the egg is released.<br>  <br>  It is not necessary to time intercourse to coincide with ovulation. That’s because both the sperm and the egg can live inside you for a while. The egg can last approximately 24 hours after ovulation. If sperm are available anytime during this 24 hour window, you can get pregnant. You don’t have to have sex within the 24 hour window, though. That’s because sperm can live inside you for days, waiting for the egg to be released. You can get pregnant by having intercourse anywhere from several days before ovulation to a day after ovulation.<br>  <br>  For example, if you ovulate on day 14 (counting the first day of your period as day 1), you can get pregnant by having sex anytime between days 9-15, and perhaps days 8 and 16 as well. Conception will take place on day 14 or so, but you may have had sex many days before conception.<br>  <br>  The bottom line: You don’t have to time sex to coincide with ovulation. If you have sex at anytime within days of ovulation, you can get pregnant|`|wOyyZjY0aa	First of all how long are your cycles?  Are they regular?  Some women have a 28 day cycle, so that means they ovulation on day 14.  Now like me, my cycles range from 21-31 days, so I honestly never know when I am going to ovulate.  <br>  It might help to jump online and do alittle research.  Your best odds of conceiving right away it to know your body.<br>  Best of luck|`|U2KUjFoSaa	good luck! go see a doc and ask away, they are he best to give you accurate answers to your questions.
BxrU8kUJaa	If you're on your mom's insurance you're meeting their basic criteria for coverage.  The rest of the questions about your school/living status are unimportant.<br>  <br>  The key thing for you to check out is if your mom's insurance has a "DEPENDENT PREGNANCY POLICY".  You might be able to have a sore throat looked at with that coverage but as a dependent you aren't offered maternity benefits. <br>  <br>  Make a call to the insurance and ask, and ask them to send you documentation either way.  If they say yes, keep it for later should they refuse to pay claims.  If they say no, you'll need that proof to apply for Medicaid.|`|ioZeveazaa	You will need medicaid. If you move away from your mom or marry your boyfriend, you instantly lose insurance. Good luck!|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Unless your mom has magical insurance it probably only covers children at home or at college still under the care of the parents. If you get married you are no longer covered. If you aren't in school you will probably be dropped as well.<br>  <br>  So if you choose to marry this man you will need to apply for medicaid unless he has private insurance through his work.|`|2G8lOPN8aa	Most insurance programs will cover a child over the age of 18 only if they are a full time student in college.  If you are not in college--I would think that you are already ineligible to be on her insurance given that you are 18.  <br>  <br>  If you wanted to be responsible...you'd have waited until you were actually married before you got yourself into this pickle.  Going on medicaid is NOT responsible.  That means the rest of us are paying for and your child, instead of you and your fiance.  If you got married--you'd be covered on his insurance...provided he even has a decent job, which I certainly hope he does if he is going to have a child support.|`|b5eee7836be345dc0c629dc9caf5bd55aa	you have to tell your mom because her insurance will need proof of pregnancy (a note from your midwife/OB doc) so they will cover the services you recieve like blood tests, ultrasounds, and appts.<br>  You should apply for your state's medical program so you and the baby can both be covered because after so long your moms insurance will want to stop covering you, especially if you move out.<br>  and the sooner you tell her the sooner she will get over the fact of you being pregnant and the quicker she can become excited and supportive. and though you don't think that will happen, trust me, with time it will. i've been there. I now have my 11 day old baby and she is spoiled rotten by my parents. it took a couple weeks for them to adjust to me being pregnant (especially my dad) but my mom respected my decision to keep the baby once I told her I made up my mind and there was no changing that. mom's are good like that.<br>  <br>  best of luck =]|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Her insurance will cover you until you get married, then you will have to find other insurance as it will no longer be her responsibility.

ca61402689139a586d12bf2b7cdcc48aaa	Im 31 weeks pregnant with my 5th child. This was the exact same case with my fourth child, who is now 4 years old. I had the option of a c-section and in the end i chose to try natural, knowing they would do everything to protect my child and myself, anytime they felt "worried" or concerned that i would be rushed for a c-section. As i was giving birth part of the placenta did pull away from the wall, BUT i had a healthy baby boy born at 35 weeks he was 6lbs 15 oz. Im glad i choose to try it instead of choosing the c-section. Ive given birth naturally to all my children. I trusted in my OB, he told me they would moniter it all, and if there were any concerns they would take me for an emergency c-section. This made me feel better. They did the delivery right in the surgery room, he told me it would take them approx 2 mins to get to the baby via c-section. I felt comfortable in that. Now with my 5th child, at 18 weeks i was told i had partial placenta previa, by week 28 it had moved enough out of the way to cause no concern. This problem becomes more and more possible with the more children you have. Talk to your doctor, and do what you feel comfortable with. My son is healthy and is 4 years old now :) You have to follow your heart. The worse thing you can do is have doubt in whatever choice you make, and stress can cause more harm than anything! Try to stay calm about it. I know how scary it is, and i also know reading things online can only cause more stress, just talk with your OB and ask all the questions you need answers to :) Goodluck and congrats on the baby!!!!<br>  <br>  Mom of 4 boys and 31 weeks with boy 5!!|`|15fbdd1ddde8d18efa4186d8cc0bfcb5aa	Only get a c-section if you really need it|`|742ac02da842746410daa4bb6b0cd744aa	The only person I know that had that had a c-section.  She started bleeding at home and had to go to the hospital in an ambulance.  Could you get induced at the hospital a little early like 38 weeks or so, so if something DID happen, you could have a c-section without going through what my friend went through?  I'm sorry for your situation.  I wish the best for you.|`|nqQs9yCDaa	How far along are you?  I would wait until you are close to delivery to decide.  In a lot of women with placenta previa, the placenta moves upwards over time and so that it is not a problem by the time they deliver.  Good luck with your delivery either way!|`|cnMXJMFUaa	LE is 3.5cm from the os hmmm I would opt for c-section, less risk, its just close enough to where yes you could delivery normally, or it could cause major problems resulting in an emergency "c" anyway...just my opinion.|`|8I4Frndfaa	Discuss with your doctor, and then get a second opinion, another if they don't agree.<br>  <br>  Other advice: Talk to God, and I mean that in the very best way.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, whatever you do don't stress.

IgoybtTtaa	It's different for everyone. Typically, breastfeeding delays the return of your menses. That said, I know one woman who breastfed and yet had her period a month after post-partum bleeding stopped! <br>  <br>  I breastfed exclusively until around 5 months, then began introducing solids, but my son continued to nurse six or seven times a day, then four or five times at night until he was 10 months old, when the nighttime boobie was cut. Still, no period until I went back to work and five days a week nursing was cut down to once each side in the morning, once each side at evening. That week I got my first period :P UGH. It's still not predictable, and he's 17 months now. <br>  <br>  Oh - and I had a C section too. Shouldn't affect things at all, as far as your body's hormones go, you had a baby, it doesn't matter how.|`|bc0af676eb2525e58e7cf95c335579c5aa	I did not have a period for 10 months after my second c-section.  I was breastfeeding so if you are not, it could come sooner.  Just a note, I was not using birth control because I got so accustomed to not having a period.  Surprise, it was a little girl.  :)|`|3a79b51cda6182933b2e1318c9e4fb1baa	With my first C section, it took nearly 3 months to start my cycle again. With my second, a mere 6 weeks.|`|6cc3345687beaa7b8f4a239de5c65ff3aa	I breastfed until 3 months, it's been nearly 6 months since the section now and still nothing. I often wonder if it's coming back but am definitely enjoying it gone!!|`|RXsnhv36aa	my wife had a c-section in march and breastfeed till the baby was a month and she didn't get hers back until are daughter was 3 months|`|ogREfC9qaa	After c section, I had mine immediately. Are you breastfeeding? I am pretty sure that can prolong it.|`|k7KiIzexaa	i just had a c-section in march and breast-fed for about a month..but after i was done breastfeeding my period came a couple days later. If you didnt breastfeed at all..i would think you should have had it by now.
gWryQgf8aa	If its a long trip, buy playtex bottle liners and bottles. It would be much easier for you. All you would have to do is toss out the liner and replace it with a new one. <br>  <br>  If its a short trip, steralize all your bottles and pack them away for the trip, as you need them, pull them out and fill them up.|`|3342a98d3a173fa43509f0af219b81a9aa	I would switch to those EvenFlo bottles that have disposable liners.

c35059e10a1338a31afe1247ef1497e7aa	I have researched into this and apparently you have a three day window where you are very fertile and it's the day before ovulation, the day of and the day after.  They say to have sex on every day of the fertile day.   Which I'm in the same boat as you with the hubby bit!!!! it's not easy.<br>  <br>  You did it at the right time, so you'll just need to wait two weeks and then test!!!|`|CyAKK59Daa	It's not hard, just keep having sex with as many guys as you can until you get pregnant.|`|tVF9O1Olaa	You could be pregnant but the only thing you can do is wait (hardest thing to do i know!!) As for not knowing when your period is the best thing to do is wait 19 days after ovulation and then take a test (that is what it says on test packet!) but if it says negative then do another test a week later! Good luck and i hope you get the results you want!x

Quello che hai fatto è cmq il tuo bagaglio di vita, che ora ti porti appresso in ogni nuova relazione, in ogni nuova esperienza. Devi solo imparare a distinguere bene la superficialità, quella che ti ha portato a fare scelte che oggi rinneghi, e la leggerezza, che invece devi recuperare per capire che a 13 anni non c'è niente che non si possa risolvere.

Ti stai perdendo in un problema che non c'è. Credimi.. <br>  Quindi, se ti piace il ragazzo.. senti che è cosa buona e giusta per te, e senti di poter esser cosa buona per lui.. fatti avanti. Fatti baciare, sii spensierata e goditi l'adolescenza e la tempesta di sensazioni che porta.<br>  Il 4 lui parte.. vabè.. vorrà dire che vi sarete regalati un esperienza piacevole. <br>  Non ti opprimere in seg.he mentali.
