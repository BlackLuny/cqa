I have a dog park not far from me and i like to take the dogs there for fun or go walking on the trail around the park. the problem is her dog gets car sickness. I've never had this problem with my yorkie or any of my other dogs.       i tried withholding food and water a few hours before i plan on putting the dog in the car but that doesn't work. it still manages to throw up though it's all liquid. i tried driving around with him frequently to help him get used to it but that doesn't work either and he might even throw up more than once during a one way trip.      there is nothing physically wrong with him and he only throws up in the car so he doesn't need a vets attention

That seems so backwards to me...I would think they would shed more in the summer time :)

20081005203703AAkr7ny	Pets;Dogs	Some general Pit Bull information, please!?	So, I got my first exposure to pit bulls about a week ago and I fell completely in love. So curious and loveable! I actually volunteered at an adoption days for a local no-kill shelter, and I had such a blast.       There is one specific puppy dog (okay, so he is over a year old. All dogs are puppies to me) that I fell completely in love with. He has been in the "system" for over a year, and I want to give him hugs and kisses and so much lovies. He loved everyone that came to "meet" him. The sad problem is that though he isn't dog aggressive, he wasn't socialized properly as a pup so he... well, let me just quote it from the website. "And, because he was not properly socialized with other dogs earlier in life, he does not understand how to appropriately play with other dogs. Thus, he needs to be in a home with no other pets." Okay. So. The whole time I was there he was never growling in the direction of any of the other dogs.      I am hoping to get a dog come spring, and if he is still (sadly) available I really want to adopt him. If not, I really want to give a home to another pit bull or pit bull mix.      I have been around dogs my whole life, my grandpa was a dog breeder, and... really, they are my most favorite animal ever. The "problem" is that, since pit bulls are such a unique breed and have SUCH a sad stigma attached them I want to be as INFORMED as possible when and if I adopt one.      So, after all that rambling my basic question is what do I NEED to know about pit bulls as a breed in general? What are some good informative websites (or even *gasp* BOOKS) on our loveable dogs? I honestly am too afraid to Google them because I tried to search for some fun videos on YouTube and there were so many dog fight videos, I just couldn't take it.      Thank you all so much for any help!

20081005203432AATQbVD	Pets;Dogs	Our English Bulldog is 7 months old and is very aggressive towards my two youngest children (ages 5 and 2). ?	They are terrified of her so they scream and run whenever she's around. This only makes her worse! She will jump on them, bite them and will not stop until we pull her off. We've tried grabbing her by the scruff of her neck, shaking her, and yelling "No!" and "Stop!" but nothing works. We even sent her to an obedience trainer for 2 weeks but when she returned, she was able to follow basic commands but since our children were still scared of her, she still tries to attack them. So far she's bitten our children and the son of one of our friends too!  She is now confined to the garage (it's air conditioned) and has very little interaction with our children. The trainer said there's nothing she can do because our childrens' reaction to her is what is causing her to act this way.I've tried getting my children to calm down but since they are so young, it's impossible for me to keep them from reacting in fear when she comes at them. I am at my wits end. She's a very sweet dog to us and our oldest daughter, but for some reason she is a monster towards young children! What can I do?

20081009132645AArPTCB	Pets;Dogs	Is Min Pin crated while at work wrong?	Since my previous question about my 15 month old Min Pin having Demodex since he was about 5 months old, I started investigating to some things maybe we as owners are potentially doing wrong.      Since my girlfriend and I got him as an 8 week old puppy, we have crate trained him with great success.  We made it a happy place for him to go, he never whines or barks while we're gone per our neigbors.  However, I've heard stress can be a main cause of Demodex and the consequent hair loss.      Our little guy would destroy our house if we let him roam free while we're at work, so we have always crated him while we're at work.  We never have had a problem and he seems to be sleeping when we come home from work and he's excited to see us when we let him out.      Is what we are doing "wrong"?  It is usually between 6-8 hours that he is in there while we're at work.  Other than that, we give him tons of attention and exercise and he's seems happy overall.  Is there another option if crating while at work is "wrong"?  Thanks!

I have the Petsafe little dog bark coller which I used on my 2 year old min pin chihuahua mix (she's between 12-15lbs, deer legged and slender, not much to her. . .) and I LOVED IT! For a small yappy, needy dog it worked great. We recently got a minature pincher puppy who will be going on 5 months in the next few weeks. The problem is at 5 months she only weighs 2.5 lbs.  We still crate the tiny min pin while we're at work as we also have a rotti and don't want to worry about her getting hurt (she thinks she's bigger than the rot), but we rent our basement and she is pretty vocal all day while she is in the crate. Just wondering if anyone knows or has experience with this collar on a tiny toy breed. The package says nano technology for small dogs and toy breeds, and the collar does go small enough to fit her neck, i just worry about her size even if it is a harmless static. ADVICE??

20081104182041AAjRpXD	Pets;Dogs	How do I get my 6 month old puppy to stop eliminating in the crate?	I have a 6 month old pug and he's house trained for the most part.  He's a wonderful dog except for the fact that when he's left in his crate during the daytime when I'm at work, he eliminates in there and then sits in it or eats it.  I know he can hold it because when I first started creating him during the day, he had weeks where he would hold it all day.  I'm only gone 8-9 hours a day and I know it seems like a long time but he adjusted after a couple of weeks and was doing so well.  He would have the occasional accident but for the most part he did very well.  For the last 3 weeks he's been going in his crate at very odd times including during the day when I'm at work.  His elimination schedule is very unpredictable.  Some times he goes right after he eats and sometimes it's several hours.  I'm at my wits end.  I scrub the tray every night when I get home.  Do I need to change his feeding schedule?  Am I not cleaning the crate well enough?  Or is it just possible that he's decided he doesn't want to hold it anymore.  I know he's capable of holding it because he has in the past.  What do I do?

20081122112331AAtnRDu	Pets;Dogs	Is it possible to teach your dog to put away his toys? ?	I have a basket in the corner where I toss the dog toys when I'm tidying up, so I was just wondering if there was any way to teach your dog a command to pick up his toys and put them back.       It's not a big deal (it's not like it's a lot of work) he's just already covered all of his obedience so I like working on little tricks and things that keep him sharp and make life easier.       We already use "bring me a toy" and things like that... and he knows take it, drop it, leave it, etc. He can also identify certain toys by name. (Cat, ball, rope.)      He's a highly trainable dog, and I've gone to some classes with him to learn certain things like obedience. For the most part however I study his habits to learn how to teach him things on our own. He picks things up pretty well and it works for us. This trick however is more difficult, since he automatically associates picking up a toy with playtime. I think it's confusing when I tell him to drop it, then play time is over. Also, I usually don't use treats (just praise) to train, so how do I reward this? It seems like he's losing his toy, which isn't really a reward. Should I just move on to the next novelty trick, or is this do-able?

20081114003127AAR7lHt	Pets;Dogs	A spaniel or a terrier?	which dog would be better for my mom?      she wants a small, gentle, and fairly easy to train dog to be friends with.  a dog thats mainly easygoing.. and not a bundle of pent up energy [i dont want her to get hurt, my mom had knee surgery a month ago].  yet not necessarily a lap dog.      i'd also like your opinion on how old the dog should be when we get one.  she wants a puppy.. maybe 5-9 months.  but im thinking an older dog would be better because then it'll be more relaxed, confident, and not so excitable.  what do you think??      we're planning on going to the local shelter to look for a dog.  i know shelter dogs are mainly mixed breeds.  im just wondering what kind of breed to look out for.        a spaniel or a terrier??  my mom said she wouldn't mind a beagle either.  i dont really know these breeds temperaments.. hence this post.      opinions?  suggestions?  all those are welcome.      thank you!!!

My GSD is 11 months old and the yorkie is 10 months. The yorkie is only 1lb and the Shepherd is about 80lbs.       The Shepherd does not bite her, but puts its mouth around her I am assuming to show dominance. It wont let her walk around the house and if she leaves from under my kitchen table she chases her back over there. Both of them are female and they have been together for the last 6 months. I know it will probably take time, but does anyone have any ideas.      The Shepherd is extremely stubborn!!!

20090309223604AAMHjAg	Pets;Dogs	My dog peed in her bed after going to the groomers?	My dog is an 8 year old female toy poodle named Blossom. Today I took her to the groomers and she was there for about 4 hours. I picked her up and everything seemed fine and when we got home things were fine too. She behaved normally all night long, but when I went into my bedroom to go to sleep, I noticed her bed looked stained. I knew she hadn't been THAT dirty so I picked it up and it dripped on my foot. I knew then she had peed in her bed, and quite a large amount too it seemed. This has never happened before and I am pretty sure it was due to stress, but would she wait to pee in her bed until we got home due to the stress of being at the groomers? I mean I'd think she would pee outside the store or maybe right in the store if she was scared, but could the affect of her being groomed have caused her to be stressed when she came home as well, enough to have her pee in her bed?

20070721194033AARA1De	Pets;Dogs	How to train my dog to behave and do other things?	I have a 3month old Siberian Husky. I've been crate training her and now I now I need to teach her to come to me whenever I call and other tricks. She is  3 months old so is this too soon to teach her and for it to be effective. I use to whistle and whenever I do she would come running cause I had a treat. Now I would whistle and she wouldn't even look or respond to me and keeps on doing whatever shes doing. I have been crate training her for about 3 weeks so far and from time to time I would let her walk around upstairs and she would eliminate and urinate all over my carpet when I'm not looking. She also eats rocks and other various things when I walk her. My question is how do I stop and teach her not to do that. So the general question is how do I teach her to behave. She has been acting too crazy and wild running around but im thinking this is normal since she is a puppy. would she mellow down when shes older?? Should I take her to obedience classes at petsmart?

His behavior has not changed though, he acts just as active as he usually is and does not seem to be in any pain.  We have taken his temperature and it is normal, but we are still very concerned.  At what point do we rush him to the vet?  Any thoughts on what might be causing him to vomit whould be appreciated.  We have not changed his diet recently or made any changes to our habits or routines that might be causing him to be vomit, so we're stumped.

20090309201613AAup2Ts	Pets;Birds	Mama green cheek biting babies?	So, I've been breeding green cheek conures for a little over a year now and lately the hen has been biting the heck out of her babies. I don't know why she does it, I try hard not to bother her (but I do have to check on them from time to time, about once a week). The male guards outside the nestbox and brings her food, but otherwise he really doesn't have much to do with them. Anyways, this time when I pulled the two oldest babies, one of them has a deep, deep gouge in its back that is pretty bloody. I was wondering if anybody either:      A. knows the cause of why she is being so aggressive   B. knows what I can do to help the baby with the huge gouge. It's not life-threatening, some babies from other clutches have had gouges too, but I need to know if there's any way I can wrap it/help it out. It looks very painful...      Thank you. Serious answers only, please.

20090309180449AAX0BrZ	Pets;Horses	What should I do.. buy or not...?	I lease an 18 thoroughbred gelding. He's extremely advanced and used to show at 3'6"-3'9" 'AA' hunters. He now jumps 2'3" safely and is extremely calm. He never bucks/rears/spooks ANYTHING. (except once last week while leading him on the ground he freaked out badly)   He clips/ties/cross-ties/bathes/stands for farrier/sheath cleans w/o sedation everything. He's all around the most perfect bombproof horse who has so much love. He has amazing conformation and carries himself well. His only fault is that he's 18 and can only jump 2'3" or 2 foot. At the moment he's still at my level. My barn has a huge lesson program from walking on lead line lessons to lessons for people competing in the Maclay. There are over 50 school horses and probably 250 privately. He's been owned/leased at my barn for almost his whole life.l The barn owns him and I'm sure that since he can go from taking a first timer on a ride without any spooks, to jumping 2'3" hunter courses half-passing, flying lead changes etc.. he's going to be overworked. I love this horse to death. He's all I think about, I can't imagine ever leaving him. I full-lease and pay $800 flat fee, and everything else he needs. To buy him I would be paying the same fees except $400-$500 board. So instead of $800 a month, $450. I already pay his $250 shoe bill every 6 weeks, his medications, his injections, his feed, everything.    -Buy a more advanced horse   -Buy him and stay at the same place riding wise   -Keep leasing      I love him so much! I just don't know what to do.
20090309200604AAQ3oFP	Pets;Fish	Molly aggression! Did I do the right thing?	I made the stupid mistake of getting another male molly with the 4 females and 1 other male I already had. So now, as you can guess, the males are fighting like crazy. (I honestly don't know what crosses my mind sometimes when I'm getting fish...) So anyways, I put 2 females in my 10 gallon with my dalmation male, and I put 2 females in my 20 gallon with my black male.      Was this the right thing to do? My male dalmation is still rude to other species, and he'll pick on my corys, platies and guppies. My female dalmation molly does this too.      I just got the new male on the weekend, so he's still settling in a bit, though I think he's figured out that he wants to be mean...      Anyhow, what should I do? I can't bring the male back to the petstore, because they don't accept returns. (Stupid idiots....)      I will choose best answer and any other answers will be appreciated!   Thanks!
20090309193025AAHxyaZ	Pets;Horses	How much to ask for an exercise rider?	I am starting at the end of this week helping a woman break in her young horses. (Shes a trainer but is getting old and wants someone a little younger to do the first couple of rides) and help her friend just get some rides on the horses she buys, trains then sells. So my question is how much should I ask for payment wise? And should it be by the hour or by the horse?    They are Paso Finos (If you need it) and I don't need to worry about gas and she is literally my next door neighbor (I can walk there in 5 minutes)   I have been riding for 13 years and have been training for 9. I have ridden other peoples horses but it has always been a tit for tat kind of thing (you ride my horse this week for me and next week ill ride yours)   I have training in multiple disciplines including low level dressage, jumping, western, barrel racing, trail and small shows.   So any input?

20090309222654AAZmyrc	Pets;Cats	What's wrong with my cat's eye?	Our kitty Little Bit has a very unusual eye. She looks like a normal cat, both eyes intact, and 95% of the time her eyes are normal. But there's the every once in a while when she'll wake up and her right eye will be funky. The third eye lid will look like it's covering more than half her eyeball- giving it the "knocked outta place" look with some slight swelling around her eye. Normally, it's not red, it just looks to stay half closed even when her eyes are wide open. It'll stay that way for an hour or two, she generally either squints her eye shut or just acts normal until it goes away. And odd thing is it does. She's fine and pretty in no time at all after a couple of hours, with or without our help.      But the thing is, right now it's in bad shape. She woke up with it as always, but this time it's red and swollen and she doesn't look like she can blink very well. I think it might be the third eye lid may be inflamed, but I dunno what could be causing it. One would think that if she had considerable eye problems, she'd have them all the time or more often than just once in a blue moon. There's only a couple of vets in our area whose prices are outrageous and they have no payment plans, no exceptions. Right now, we can't afford that.      But she does have all her shots and doesn't have any underlying diseases. We've been alternating between putting cold compress and warm cloth to her eye, which normally doesn't bother her, but right now she's a bit protective of her eye, so I'm guessing it's uncomfortable or hurts.       If any of ya'll have any other helpful tips as to what causes it or home remedies to treat it, I'd truly appreciate it.

Since then my peekapoo would not go around other animals and would growl and show his teeth to other animals. Can't blame him, but something strange has happened.  The dog that was protecting him after his attack has moved back into the area and my dog follows him around like its his mother. Shares his toys an plays with him.  I say that he remembers the dog protecting him.  My husband says a dog can't remember that long ago.  I say they can, how else can this be explained, as to why my dog is taking to this dog. When he won't play with any other dogs Not even puppies.Thanks in advance for any help

20081005195442AA9bHUA	Pets;Dogs	I have A Shetland Sheepdog-Mini Australian shepherd mix I would like to know the fallowing?	OK first off I let my little girl pick out the pup for her fifth birthday! There were plenty of pure breeds of both types there but she chose her! So please don't tell me that I am A bad person for getting A mix. Both breed are good with little kids I do know that but I would like to know more.A little about her she is 5 months old. She looks just like A shelter but has some spots on her mussel. She is 13lbs right now.   My questions are as fallows but any info not asked for but would be helpful would be appreciated!!   OK.   1) When will she get her adult coat?   2) What type of problems might I encounter her when she gets older?   3) If you have this mix! Were or are you happy the way it turned out?   4) What if any thing is this mix call as A nick name?    Note I don't want to here mixed or mutt!!!   5) Is there any type of training book that would be good for me to get that my little girl can fallow along with and enjoy that you have found practical and use full?   6) She is on the more vocal side do you know of any thing other that the stop bark collar that might help? I don't mind her barking when she is having some free time with my other dog!   7) She gets A long great with my chihuahua but I am A bit concerned about how she is reacting to my other pup. Barking at him or staying far away from him and growling at him but only through the glass door not when they are both in the same area! Any thoughts?   8) Are there any dog parks near Interlachen, Fl that is free to go to that my little girl can also go to with me?   9) Dose clicker training really work?   10) Also she would rather play with the puppy pads rather then use them any advice? They are the scented type! I have also tried the kind with the tape on the back  it dose not help either she has no problem getting them up.   11)  She is also being aggressive over the food even after she is done eating! I have tried putting the food in two different places and even feeding with one out and one in but she still growls at him and tries to get to him and will not eat unless he is in the same general area as she is. She dose not hurt him but I am worried that she might also my moms cat thinks that he is A dog = he gets the same treatment (yes he also wants to eat the dog food but he also eats cat food). Any thoughts on that one?   12) I would like to know any thing else about ether breed that you think might be help full!      My little girl thank all of you that have taken the time to read all of this and that gives us any helpful info!!!! :)

20081006181820AA42BrN	Pets;Dogs	Behavior Problem When Guests Arrive?	I have a 2 year old Boxer who is an absolute TERROR when people come to the door...not in a nasty, mean way, but just incredibly hyper.  He jumps and spins as they try to come in the door and will not give them even an inch to get in.  Then he runs around the house like the devil is chasing him before resuming the jumping routine again.  This lasts for about 5 minutes before he calms down to a reasonable (yet still annoying) level.  We have tried grabbing him by the collar and forcing him to sit and also keeping him on a lease, but he pulls and jumps anyway and it usually ends up in me getting hurt.  When I finally do release him, he just picks up where he left off.  I am really embarrassed by his behavior and even worried he will hurt someone on accident...any suggestions on how to get him to behave for guests?
20081008101017AAzPzUB	Pets;Dogs	My dog has an anxiety problem I think....what to do?	His a 1 1/2 year old adorable rambunctious toy fox terrier.  He is too smart for his own good.  His name is Mister Peyton Manning.  We got a long-haired chihuahua for him, she is 7 months old and her name is Missy.  We also have a 3 1/2 year old.   Sooooo my 3 year LOVES to play with her puppies, and they love it to.  All 3 of them will chase each other around for hours.  In the mix of it all he will have an accident, a very runny accident.  I feel so bad for him, because he'll do it right in front of us and then go hide somewhere with his tail tucked.  Also, I think Missy gets to him (they must have marital problems, lol) they were just eating in the laundry room and I shut the door and I heard her in their barking at him over sharing the food, and then I opened the door and he had an accident.  Now if everything is fine and the dogs are running around the house of just laying down and my daughter is in bed.  We'll let him outside and he's find when he goes.  It's just with commotion I guess, so what can I do for him??

He's been having issues shedding, and I've been having issues keeping his tank clean with his aspen bedding. However, Fluffy (yes, I named my snake Fluffy) LOVES to burrow. The problem, he likes to burrow around his water dish. This could be because it's usually wet around the water dish, and he likes it wet while he's shedding.    I'm considering switching over to newspaper and leaving a little moss for him to burrow through.    I also want to keep better track of making sure he doesn't get mites and making sure that he sheds properly.   Should I switch over to newspaper?

She only feeds him science diet dog food and nothing else..      Could this be because he ate his poop at the puppy mill?

20090309222259AAhKWR8	Pets;Dogs	What Questions Should I Ask This Breeder?	As you all know in my previous question I am interested in buying a Hungarian Vizsla from this breeder (I posted the link to the breeder, on the question)-  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       On my last question about the breeder i got- very good breeder, o.k breeder etc..   from what i know and have read i am going to go with- good/o.k breeder. But i want to ask questions and talk to the breeder & then make my full judgment about the breeder then.    PS. i will not be buying a puppy from them anytime soon, soonest would be 1-2 years from now.      What should i ask the breeder? (That is not mentioned on the website)      The puppy i get from them i will be doing agility and conformation with if that matters. If your curious the reason why i am waiting this long is because i want to learn everything about the breed, conformation & agility. I want to go to shows and look for a mentor etc. I do not want to rush into this, so 1-2 years gives me perfect time to get well educated & ready for a show quality pup.      This is my first time buying and getting into the show circuit.      I have had numbers of dogs since i was born, all where rescues. I work/volunteer at my local shelter, I foster & sponsor many shelters dogs. I have 3 rescues of my own. I thought it might be great to have a show quality dog to do agility and conformation with- but adopting, rescuing, fostering and sponsoring is something i will ALWAYS do. So please no remarks of "Why not get a shelter dog". I have had in my lifetime about 100+ shelter dogs! Thank you very much!! :D

20090309215545AAHowMJ	Pets;Dogs	Are all people who judge dogs based on breed also racist?	Because it seems to me that if you understand why racism is wrong, why judging people based on their race, nationality, gender, religion etc. is wrong, then why can't you understand that judging dogs based on breed is wrong for the same reasons?      I understand there's a lot of emotional involvement when we talk about pit bulls, rottweilers and other "aggressive breeds."  I'm sure there's more than one person reading this who knows someone who was attacked and seriously injured or even killed by a individual member of these breeds.  As much as I sympathize with your anger, how can you condemn an entire breed based on the action of an individual?  That's as appallingly wrong as saying "A Latino guy raped my sister, so all Latinos are rapist thugs, so lets gas em all."  I mean, there are some people out there who would draw that conclusion, and I understand why they can blanket hate a breed.  But how can the rest of us, who realize and are appalled by the flaw in that thinking, then turn around and use the same logic to justify breed discrimination?

20090309214400AAFArc3	Pets;Cats	My cat's nose is cloggy?	My cat is roughly 3 years old. For as long as I can remember, she's always had a problem with her nose getting clogged.   It usually results in crusty-looking build-up on the sides of her nose and cover parts of her nostrils. Sometimes she will clean it herself, but often I clean it for her with a damp wash cloth.   She's otherwise healthy, always eats and drinks properly (though she does tend to stick her face in her water dish and suck instead of lap. Sometimes she sneezes because she gets water up her nose), she's very playful. No personality or routine changes.    I feel badly for her, because she squeaks when she breathes, and i wonder if she sometimes has a hard time.   Is there something wrong with her? or is this just something she needs a little help with keeping clean.

20090309223338AAt42g7	Pets;Dogs	Does anyone have trouble with doggie anxiety? (Not seperation anxiety...)?	I've got a 3 year old Shiba Inu. He's a very happy, active dog during the day... But when i take him in my room at night to go to sleep he starts to shake and pant and tremble... He does this for like ever and I have to lay him on his back and put my arms around him until he falls asleep. He never does this in anyone elses rooms... And he never did it in any of my old rooms. His paws sweat. It's really strange... I know It's a form of anxiety... I'd just like to know what it's from. Anyone know?

20090309224535AA2DwMU	Pets;Dogs	My dog's poop/pooping habits are not normal?	My dog has never really pooped inside, but lately she has pooped at least 5 times in 1 day in the house without letting me know she needs to go out. Also her poop is really runny, she has some solid ones, but mostly running, and a little bit at a time. She is also not eating as much as she normally would, and what we offer her she doesn't take it anymore. Earlier today I took her out for a walk and she ate some grass and, I don't know if the grass did this, but her poop was as red a blood, and when my husband took her out earlier he mentioned he saw the same red poop. Also she is not as active as normally, she always likes our legs when we get out of the shower and follows me around, but she didn't do any of that today.   We did not change anything in her lifestyle or food. She always has clean/fresh food and water.   I am really worried about my dog. Does anyone know what can cause all of this, I know I need to take her to the vet, but our next day off is not till Wednesday.

20090309230906AA4cw6s	Pets;Cats	Why are my cats scabby?	I have two male cats that used to be outdoor cats. After developing a bad case of fleas they started to get dry skin. Due to the dry skin they started to chew their skin, I think they were itching from the bites and dry skin. They then started to develops scabs from the chewing and    scratching. They're very dry and I think it's causing the cats discomfort.    the cats are indoor cats. They've been taken to the vet a few times and the medication doesn't seem to work. Any suggestions?

I picked him up and did a little mini health check on him, and when I looked at his teeth --- they looked like this :(  I figured it couldn't be good, but I was wondering if anyone can tell me whats going on with his teeth? They were fine a few days ago..    They align up fine when he bites down and stuff, he eats veggies slower than normal and he's eating his pellets noramally. I have tried pushing them together but they just go right back apart  :-X    So anyone of you might have experienced this? or have any suggestions what to do (other than take him to the vet) that would be great! thanks!       http://i40.tinypic.com/1y06yf.jpg

20090309232213AAiha5R	Pets;Dogs	Help starting a Pit Bull rescue?	I met a guy that took in an abused Pit Bull, he had a ad on craigslist asking for people to help socialize his dog, so I offered my 3 Pit bulls to help. We have met 3 times and the dogs are doing good. He got another Pit Bull the other day (like my saying goes, once you own one Pit Bull you can't help but get more) but they all are getting along very good. He was talking to me today about wanting to start a Pit Bull rescue, he is very serious and going to talk to the bank tomorrow. He's not sure how to get it started neither do I and I would like to help him. So any advice or sites any one has would be much appreciated. Thanks.  Also I heard that many rescues can get food donations from like Iams and places like that ...and also low cost shots and spay/neuter how do I find out about that? Just go to different vets and ask?

20090309232316AA4CgMG	Pets;Cats	Taking kitten home early.?	I have already asked a question about 4 weeks being to early to take a kitten home, and I will try to get the owner to keep the kitten another week or so.      When the kitten does come home at around 5 weeks, I wasn't sure if she should just have wet food for a while, or can go straight to hard food, I have Iams kitten food, I also have whiskas wet food pouches as a treat I was thinking of giving every week.       I was also thinking of giving the kitten cat's milk until 8 weeks of age, but I don't know how much, and in addition to the dry food, or wet if advised.      If I give my kitten cat's milk in addition to water, dry kitten food and occassional wet food (once a week) at this early age, is this the best way to go, or should I do something else?
