JiCKFTuIaa	I'm waiting to see who manages to answer this one in the space available.(wink)<br>  <br>  Your best bet is going to be a trip to the local library, because training a herding dog takes up a volume, not a paragraph.<br>  <br>  Soldier Hollow is right in my back yard, so on Labor Day weekend I get to go watch the world sheepdog championships. If you have the opportunity to ever go see this, it will give you a completely different prospective of what our dog can do. I've been around stock dogs my entire life, and I only thought I could train a stock dog.<br>  here is a news paper link<br>  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-08-30-Sheepdogs_N.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007...</a>|`|AA10283080	Your best bet would be to hire a trainer.<br>  <br>  I have 3 shepherd (we call them shepherd mixes because they are a lot like Australian shepherds but they're actually mutts) mixes who have been trained since the age of 2 months to herd and protect my livestock. Of course they learned from their parents and their parents learned from their parents and so on. My family has owned their lineage for longer than even I've been alive and I'm 33 years old.<br>  <br>  Since you probably won't be getting any dogs the way I did I would suggest researching the breeds and buying from a breeder who specializes in dogs that have been bred for their herding abilities.|`|bIaywrBCaa	A good dog from working parents should not need to be trained. We owned an Australian Shepherd and she was the best. She herded our goats like a pro. She could also herd cattle and could load a truck with pigs in seconds. It was all natural instinct. I haven't owned a border collie but I can wholeheartedly attest to the workability of an AS.|`|3zv2bbolaa	Ideally you should only need one dog to work most herds. There are different jobs on a farm: gather from large pastures, sorting indivduals out from the herd for medication or other reasons, pen work, holding, small pasture work, etc..<br>  <br>  Most dogs start out training in a small round pen with a handler teaching the dog to balance and flank the stock without overrunning the sides. They learn directional commands that are essentially clockwise (Go Bye) and counter clockwise (Away) and other commands that help control the speed and pressure on the stock such as There,Walk Up, Get Around, Lie Down, Steady....<br>  <br>  As the dog develops a sense of balance to the handler and stock and learns basic directional commands, it then can move out to lighter livestock in larger pens where the dog learns not only to fetch but drive the stock while under control.<br>  <br>  Eventually the dogs are taught to make large outruns to lift and fetch the herd, how to drive them away at a steady pace and how to sort. <br>  <br>  It takes years of training to get a top working dog and ideally the novice owner and green dog will start out with an experienced trainer. The age on which they start depends on the mental maturity of the dog, but most people don't really push serious training until the dog is over a year and sometimes even two. <br>  <br>  Stock training puts an enormous amount of mental pressure on a dog and puppies sometimes don't do well and a talented dog can quit under that pressure if started too soon. <br>  <br>  If and when you need references to good stock trainers in your area I recommend this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.k9station.com/stockdog.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.k9station.com/stockdog.htm</a>|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	You need to start out by getting a dog who herds things naturally.  Border collies are the most common herd animal, but Dogue de Bordeaux and other breeds were developed to natually herd things.  After that, you socialize the dog really well as a puppy. Make sure that he spend a lot of time with the animals as he grows up, so that he won't be inclined to eat them.  Once he is old enough, then you can take him to a knowledgeable farmer or dog trainer who can help you with teaching basic commands.  The breeder you buy from is probably going to be your best source.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	There are certain breeds of dogs that have a herding instinct born in them so you will have to go for these breeds like border collies,shelties,kelpies,cattle dogs and so on.You cannot and will not be able to train any dog to herd by yuorself it requires training of the dog and YOU as to how to do it.Yes some border collies will herd withoutt any instructions but they get confused as they do not know where to herd the animals.Go to some herding trials and watch and speak to some of the contestants and they will exxplain to you the process involved.It is super you want to own a farm one day we all go through that stage and then reality sets in and one  realizes running a property or farm is hard hard work as animals have to be fed,go to market,shorn if sheep,bred,fences fixed,feed to buy like hay and grain,pay employees,have water if not connected so in drought what do you do?See if you can visit a real working farm and talk to the farmers and they will tell you it is not a life for everyone,it is hard hard work.l own one so  l know but then l do not run much stock but breed dogs b ut l still have to do all the jobs around the property.Luckily l do have electricity,phone connected but only bottled gas and tank water so when in drought which we are having now and bushfires it is a real issue not the pretty picture you are dreaming about.There is a chance you may marry a millionaire who has a farm  manager and you go thee for short stays,would not that be wonderful,wish l had been so lucky all my husband is is a Doctor and believe me he knows zero about the farm work although tries to help and certainly does with the breeding of our dogs.|`|df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	To train a dog you need to have a trainer. Do not listen to people who say you need to get a book. The fact is, you can't learn herding by looking at a book - it's like dancing - you need to do it to learn it. And you need to have a good trainer to teach you.  As for the dog, having a dog from working parents is helpful but not essential. The question you must ask is are you getting the dog because you plan to have livestock OR do you plan to get livestock because you have the dogs. A fundamental difference and one that will have significant meaning in what you choose.  If you have livestock and need a dog to work the stock you should get a dog from working parents not trial dogs and certainly not conformation bred (show) dogs.  Border collies or aussies are your best bet and the type of stock will make a difference in what lines you choose (cattle vs sheep).  If you're getting stock because you want to work your dogs then you can choose a wide variety of herding type dogs but note that most breeds don't have 'working' parents. The vast majority of herding breeds out there only have show lines where some dogs are used to trial on sheep (and other 'performance' venues but exceedingly few actually do work on farms. Keep in mind that by getting a dog from non-working breeds you will need to put in much more time and effort to get quality work out of these dogs.<br>  It's not necessary to have more than one dog to work a farm. Probably best to get one dog, learn how to work it and then get the other. There's a lot to learn (for the human) in working stock so it's the human that needs to put in the miles to learn it more than the dog. <br>  If you really want to learn something about herding before actually getting a dog you may want to try Vergil Holland's book on progressive training and also Lynn Leach's video on All Breed Herding. Both nice resources...but they won't teach you to herd. :)
DtkLsetkaa	I am with I love my pets.  Its their culture.  We do things (like declawing) that other countries see as barbaric, its just differences between us two.  Go check out where your bacon, chicken, or steak comes from sometime.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	China eats both cats and dogs.  I think its horrible too, but you have to remember they do not think of them as "pets".  Look at India - they probably think its very horrible that we kill cows and eat them since to their culture cows are sacred.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	While Chinese culture deems it acceptable to eat cats and dogs, it is the inhumane treatment of the animal before slaughter that's the big problem.  They believe the meat tastes better if the animal has an adrenaline rush before it dies so the cats and dogs are tortured before they kill them for that purpose.  It is sick and appalling.  <br>  <br>  I boycotted the Bejing Olympics because of the tactics theChinese government used to clean up the streets so they'd look good on TV.  Telling people (even children) that the cats carried deadly diseases and encouraging civilians to kill the cats before they killed the people was disgusting.  The selective dog culling where every dog weighing over 20 pounds was slaughtered was sickening as well.  Cats were beaten to death in the streets and dogs were pulled from their owner's homes. These are a barbaric people when it comes to animals but I'm afraid there's not much we can do about it except boycott their products and spread the word.<br>  <br>  Yes, other parts of the world need to clean up their acts too.  Animals always get the raw end of the deal and that won't change anywhere till people's attitudes towards animals change.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	oh people... stop worrying about cats in China... worry about cats in America or your own country that die every day because of pet overpopulation and bad ownership. If we ate more cats here we wouldnt have a problem. At least in China they dont have overpopulation and the cat is providing a nutritional meal... so whats the difference if a cat is cooped up in a cage at a shelter here, and they are in a small cage in china ready to be eaten. Its a cultural thing... some of the things we do here would gross other people out in the world. Its not un-civilized and not gross. Its food, its culture and its they way things have been and will be. Believe me if you are hungry enough you would eat your cat. You OBVIOUSLY have NOT been to the local Slaughterhouse.

cfbc847f69b8c58c2a9f0c1c7fd702c4aa	I'm sorry for your dogs injury.  I just had to put my dog down a week ago due to seizures caused by a cancerous brain tumor.  I actually was treating my dog for a similar situation.  My dog had Ostyomylitis.  Not sure if that's spelled right.  It's an infection caused by stepping on a nail or something of that matter that infects the bones.  It's a bone eating bacteria.  X-rays show a "haze" next to the bones where it is eating it.  After a few weeks of expensive antibiotics "clindamycin" it virtually disappeared.  I hope this is all it is for you.  If in fact your dog does have cancer, I would suggest you "stage" the cancer and see where all it has spread if it in fact has.  It does no good amputating a leg when it has spread.  You'll just be left with a 3 legged dog that still has cancer.  Malignant melanomas can often appear in the paws first.  That's what my buddy had, but it started in his mouth....another common area.  The only way to tell if it is cancerous is to do a biopsy of it.  If it comes back malignant, I would ask for staging before amputating.  See where all it has spread.  Once it reaches the lymph nodes it goes on a whirlwind and spreads to the lungs, brain and other organs.  This could be a costly situation.  Probably around $50 for each biopsy they do to see if that organ is cancerous.  If it is cancerous and staging shows it hasn't spread, I would amputate the leg.  Be prepared for alot of money being spent.  If you're interested in canine cancer, just type in canine cancer in the web browser.  It's loaded with information.  There's not one page that just answered all of my questions.  Everyone is a little different.  Hopefully this is just a bacteria that will be wiped out soon and no worries from here on out.  If not, do as much research as possible.  You owe it to your buddy.<br>  <br>  Just a quick note:  Most bone cancer occurs at the top of the shoulder blade in the arms and works its way down to the paw.  If I were a betting man....I would think that your dog just has an infection of some kind that could easily be treated with antibiotics.  My Clindamycin was about $75 for a months worth.  I would have gladly paid that every month for years to keep my old bud around.  Usually a months dose will take care of the infections.  Good luck and I hope everything is fine.|`|gkCkqqHfaa	Bone cancer doesn't show up on an X-Ray as a black spot .... it looks like grey shadows and if far along, the bone will look moth-eaten where the cancer is.<br>  <br>  I've lost a dog to bone cancer, and so has several of my friends.   It is very common in larger breeds of dogs with long bones.<br>  <br>  If it is bone cancer,  do think long and hard before you start throwing thousands of dollars away doing an amputation and chemo.   This rarely buys you more than an extra couple months if you are lucky.  The cure rate for bone cancer is less that 2% - even if caught early.<br>  <br>     Most people I know try to give the dog a good quality of life with pain meds until the cancer spreads to the lungs.<br>  <br>     I hope you will not be faced with this hard decision.

Over filtering can cause problems with algae and micro algaes as you have found out.  It can also cause problems with current and fish feedings.  Over filtering is also not good when you have live plants in the tank or are trying to grow live plants that need the neutrients from the fish wastes.  There needs to be a blance from fish waste thru the nitrogen cycle.  If this balance is too far off cloudy water, algae blooms etc can and will happen.  Good rule of thumb is to turn the volume of the tank 5 times in one hour.  SOme aquarist now believe it should be 7 but really no more.<br>  <br>  Current will also play a large roll with some fish.|`|2Q1niQAvaa	Not if you don't have any live coral or rock. If you do want that stuff you may not be able to grow it properly. But what you have now is good for meat eating fish, or anything that produces a lot a waste. because coral require algae and a lot of proteins in the water. I wouldn't recommend any anemones or stuff like that. Lion fish would do really well, definitely stick with hearty fish or meat eaters, like eel, types of shark, and rays.

pxqPEm9Aaa	I know that most breeders who sell leopard baby geckos to their costumers only sell them at around 6-8 weeks minimum. <br>  <br>  That is to determine the colors that they will have when they get older, and to get them on a routinely feeding schedule. <br>  <br>  Do not sell a leopard gecko who is not feeding properly, it will most likely die.|`|Z5zvhMIhaa	what type of leapards are you selling? i might be interested in some
u0o0bCw5aa	The reason cats are generally silent is because:<br>  <br>  A.They have a very complex skeleton that allows them to move almost fluidly in most situations. For example, thier shoulder blades are not attached to their actual skelletons, which allows them to bend their upper spine a lot more then humans can, and they walk on their tiptoes naturally. Cats have  nearly 250 bones (we only have 200), including their tail.<br>  <br>  B.Cats have a very tiny mass in relation to their size and gravity. They move without sound most of the time because the force they exert on the ground (and that the ground sends back into their feet) is generally to small to create a noticeable reverberation. (That thump on the stairs.)<br>  <br>  If your cat’s fat has caused his mass to change to the point where he’s actually thumping around, then his body size has probably doubled what it’s supposed to be and it's probably putting all sorts of unhealthy strain on his joints and bones. Poor kitty!<br>  <br>  If you really love him, you'll take him to the vet and find out how to get him back to a healthy weight. Or, if you don't have the money for that, there's a trick for dogs that I think will work for your cat; feed him twice a day, watch him eat (or allow a half hour) and then take the food away - that way he eats what he wants and is full, and can't come back for snacks later or gorge himself. If he gets -really- hungry between meals he'll hunt mice and birds and earn those callories!|`|tG8tFRY8aa	Your cat may stomp around and be so loud because it's hard for his frame to support the extra weight. He's probably just really tired when he finally gets to his bed, so he just plops down.<br>  <br>  15 pounds on a cat is like 250 pounds on a human, so it's important for cats to be the correct weight. Ask your vet what weight he should be and whether you can make any diet adjustments with him. Some cats work better on all dry, all wet, or combination diets. Get a laser pointer and exercise him more. He'll have more energy as he loses the weight and he should be a nice quiet cat again. :D|`|KAUHdcF1aa	Hahaha.<br>  How cute!<br>  Maybe he doesn't care if he's heard or not.<br>  Most cats are stalkers and they go into stealth mode whenever they please.|`|Avzzql68aa	He thumbs because he is fat.

oHL8qA42aa	It is just a shorter stride. The horse takes smaller steps with its hind end, so it is more compact. Im not sure who any of these people are but here you go!<br>  <br>  Regular canter- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBEd1siVVUQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBEd1siVV...</a><br>  <br>  collected canter- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmWCfPI0GAY&NR=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmWCfPI0G...</a>|`|RloOJ43haa	The textbook definition of canter and collected canter is in the USDF rule book which you can download from the USEF web site.|`|XbQGyiT7aa	collection occurs when a horse takes his back legs and reaches farther forward under himself. this will help him raise his back and give him the arched neck (many people think that collection comes from that arch when in reality, collection comes from the engagement of the haunches and hocks, which then travels through to the front of the horse). his strides become shorter and the horse is compressed into a smaller frame. he becomes much lighter on the forehand and moves his center of balance back on his haunches, along with most of his weight. however, the horse still maintains the same action and tempo as the working form of the gait. his steps are just slightly more elevated. there is also more connection with the bit and his head is on the vertical. this can be applied to any gait. if you watch the different levels of dressage, you can see collection in several different degrees and stages. if you also watch show jumping, you can see instances when the horse is very collected compared to when he is completely flattened out.|`|a0309e3a32a74064ccda5c6a7c7178a0aa	There is collection and extension to all gaits of a horse.  Collection refers to when the horse is 'on the bit' or in self-carriage.  A horse normally carries 70 % weight on the front legs and 30 % on the hind legs.  In collection (and extension)  the horse shifts more weight to his hind limbs.  In collection, the stride is slightly shorter and the footfall slightly more rapid (or more footfalls per linear foot/meter - because the stride is shorter.)  It is very smooth compared to the horse's regular canter (or working canter.)<br>  In an extended canter, the footfalls are less frequent per linear foot/meter because the stride is longer.  The gait will have a little more 'bounce' in the saddle, because the horse is exerting more energy to lengthen the strides.<br>  You can insert the word 'trot' and 'walk' for canter in the above and the same would be true.  All of this starts by the horse learning self-carriage.  Self-carriage is when the horse shifts weight more to the hind legs, lifts up his abdominals and sort of 'humps' his back, and steps up underneath himself with the hind legs.|`|503d9ec02105447e5fb64bf3f4d54952aa	collected is where you feel your horse collected up under you and you have a nice contact with your reins and the horses mouth. the horse stays collected in the canter and with the rider and the horse's stride  slow lope / canter stortening of strides .  smooth transistion the right head height on the horse all of these play a part on the collected canter. <br>  <br>  canter the horse isnt collected isnt smooth not using his hind end properly , riders hands aren't in good contact. the stride is lengthen<br>  <br>  this is a cool site: shows pictures you can see the horse using it's strides differntly and how he uses his hind end, <a href="http://nicholnl.wcp.muohio.edu/dingosBreakfastClub/BioMech/CantersCompared.html" rel="nofollow">http://nicholnl.wcp.muohio.edu/dingosBre...</a>  also shows the different speeds at extended canter strides, and collected etc...|`|BREi7qw7aa	a collected canter is where the horses collect their legs more up under them.. so its basicaly a canter thats shortened and collected.. if that makes sense? sorry its hard to explain!

Make sure you tellthe vet about his eye leaking, that will make a difference on the antibiotic.|`|iDxoM3X8aa	It sounds like the cat does have a allergy.I would go to the vet to be safe this may not go away without medical help and the cat may get ill.|`|tG8tFRY8aa	Your cat probably has allergies. Your vet can prescribe some medicine to help calm down the symptoms.<br>  <br>  My cat is allergic to almost everything, so he has these rashes on his chin and watery eyes about five times out of the year. It's nothing serious--it's just like human allergies. We take a pill and call it good. :D|`|31WiVpyHaa	it probably has allergies. take it to the vet...they have simple medicine. he'll be fine.
gbd4PMwfaa	You are right to consider leasing first. I leased before I bought and it was a very rewarding experience. Lease for 6 months to a year and then decide. If you truly love the horse and are willing to support him through old age then buy him, if you aren't, then find another horse. Good Luck with him.|`|x787hJbBaa	I would get a vet to look at him. Doing jumping on him might be risky and not a very good idea. Talk to his owner about her paying for the vet bills if something happens with that fetlock. Good luck.|`|Oiabe82gaa	There are many things to consider when leasing a horse. Things like age and fitness are two of the main things to consider.<br>  This horse is now 15, most people consider 12 to be an age where health issues start to develop more frequently, so 15 is getting old, not old old, but definately getting there. <br>  Add into that the fact that there are suspicions about a rear fetlock and that would make me shy away from this lease even more.<br>  Now, that being said, you could work into the lease that the owner pay any medical costs incurred in regards to the dodgy fetlock. <br>  As much experience as this horse has it is oversadowed by age and fitness, that for me would be enough to say, " thanks, but no thanks!"<br>  If you do decide to go for it I wish you both the very best of luck!!!|`|a0309e3a32a74064ccda5c6a7c7178a0aa	There are SOOOOOO MANY free horses on the market right now.  <br>  You need to ask yourself if you are financially capable of caring for this horse in the way he deserves to be cared for as he enters his more senior years.  Andalusians are extremely long-lived on average.  You may have this horse another 15 to 17 years - with only a few of those years good for riding.<br>  Whatever you decide is best for you financially - is what you should do.  <br>  EVEN if she GIVES him to you - I recommend getting a vet exam by YOUR vet and x-rays/nuclear scan to see what exactly is 'wrong' with those hind fetlocks.  That will give YOU a better idea of what you're facing.  $200.00 to $300.00 for an exam is NOTHING compared to even the monthly basic care of a horse.|`|peDwXmQJaa	It would depend on your skill level and the horses. is he going to be a horse that you WANT to ride for the next couple of year or do you need a horse that will challenge you and make you improve your riding?<br>  those are things that you need to figure out.<br>  If you not 100% sure that he will be a good mount for you for at least 2 to 3 years I would not buy, leasing would be the best option for you,<br>  As far as the medical problems go I think you should have a vet or two look at it, and think about the price of the horse and I would say if the vet says it wont be a problem for a while and the horse is under $5000 then go ahead and buy,<br>  But Consider this carefully don't rush yourself into a dission that you will regret later because horses and very expensive animals as you probably know.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Honestly I would go for it any buy him give him a good home and he still has a while to live trust me and then you will be happy to have a great horse and also you won't get a free or cheap horse in the real world.

TGuePBsqaa	I have two rabbits and they have become unseparable. If i brought one in, it think it would be really unfair to them. I think that you should keep them all outside. Think of the rabbits instead of yourself!<br>  (:|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I would keep her at free range with the others, especially if she's already bonded to the others. Rabbits are social creatures. If she's never to leave your room, then how will she get enough outside exercise? I'm sure you badly want one of the rabbits with you, but do your rabbit a favor and keep her outside with the others.
3sB49YNnaa	If he is a true albino (white with pink/red eyes and no color on the nose, ears or feet) or not makes no difference at all in the care.<br>  <br>  I haven't a clue about the pet store could have meant by "part albino".  If he is not himself all white, they could mean he had an albino parent.  If he is all white on the body with pink eyes but with dark color completely covering all his points (nose, ears or feet), he is a Himalayan.  If he has a white body, pink eyes and some fully or partially colored points and some not, he is a partial Himalayan.<br>  <br>  In any case, whatever color, its care is the same!|`|YAPEpa5baa	There is no such critter that is PART albino.  It's all or nothing.  It's like being part pregnant.  Ain't happening!  The sales clerk was obviously a clueless twit, as is the case in most big box pet stores these days.<br>  <br>  There's a possibility (doubtful) that one of the parents could've been a true albino, and your piggy can carry the gene.  But without DNA testing, you'd never know.  <br>  <br>  You most likely have a white guinea pig with pig or red eyes, or a guinea pig of another color with pink or red eyes.  The care is the same as it would be for any other guinea pig.|`|xdzn5ib5aa	No difference. =) .......PART albino? 0.o
503d9ec02105447e5fb64bf3f4d54952aa	she will foal that baby when you least expect it but try to keep an eye out for labor and her ready to deliver. you seem to be doing the right things, I dont know if you have snow where you're at or it's cold but i would try to keep in a warmer stall with shavings and when she does foal, make sure their are no problems with her tearing, bleeding, stuck foal, placenta is in tack  make sure the foal can breath and stand once done, I had an experience where I had to help the foal because the sack didnt tear and the gunk wasnt clean around the mouth. anyhow give the mother and baby bonding time before you start with touching the horse all around (imprint training is good when they are a a few hrs old. also make sure that baby starts to drink his mothers milk, they need that fresh calcium the mother produces during pregnancy... it helps immune the baby and gives it vitamins... make sure the baby can find the mothers teat with ease or you MIGHT have to guide. <br>  <br>  congrats! and goodluck!!!|`|0d15VDmFaa	She's okay, I think all that happened was that her water broke.  She should have the foal any minute.  She was probably neighing in alarm at what happened.  She'll be fine once she's finished giving birth.|`|peDwXmQJaa	Her water broke no big deal, keep an eye on her for a while she will probably go into labor soon|`|qwtbjQ2Eaa	It sounds as if she is already in labor. Depending on the horse is should arrive any time now.|`|356c35039bea626fe1d313ddc7264fc7aa	Don't be surprise if you come out one morning and find you mare had foaled, your mare is getting ready to deliver, horses don't have to much trouble unless the foal is breached than shes going to need help, but if this is her second than she should do just fine.  If your mare is in distress during her delivery you need to go in and give her a helping hand, if your not sure what to do get a vet asap or you can lose both.  Good Luck|`|bqbrKFeUaa	The change in color is probably just because her body is changing right before the foal it could be some discharge because she is to foal any day. Don't worry it's nature she'll do all the work and be fine. Good luck with the baby foal you'll love it.|`|5kUxkun3aa	i would keep a close eye on her. <br>  <br>  as for not knowing how far she is cos you got her from your grandma.<br>  has this mare not had the vet at all?<br>  do you know she isn't having twins.<br>  has she foaled before? if so was she stitched after.cos she will need opening before she foals or she will tear bad.<br>  have you got a vet you can get out if she gets in to trouble? have you let him know she is near?<br>  <br>  when she does start to foal make sure you can see front legs first and the sole of the hoof is facing down. if they are facing up,get the vet straight away.<br>  good luck
hQQuqyYcaa	First of all, provide her with as much Timothy hay as she wants. This should be true for ALL rabbits. My doe did not eat much starting at a little more than week before she was due. According to the vet, the babies were taking up most of the abdominal space, preventing her from taking much in. I had to provide extra supplements then, but with yours being only a few days away, I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just make sure she's still eating. If she stops eating, I would take her to the vet.|`|e193294baa8d6ba952ee479ba5e75b52aa	That can be normal give her some pellets not hay
xWNLHMMcaa	how about a chinchilla. there small. friendly. dont take up much space at all and very different. there fur is like that of a bunny but softer. they dont shed|`|qurG6t2qaa	ha, hes right, you basically described everything a pet is.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	A hamster or rat would be cool. I have a hamster and she doesn't take up much room or a big cage at all! Rats need pretty big cages that are atleast 2 floors high but they are awesome pets.|`|NvCcdszsaa	kitten :D Also a ferret are AMAZING but they need a big cage, smell if u dont take care of htem, and they are actually not a rodent, moreso a member of the cat family. Uhmm, Bunny? Maybe a mudskipper? I have had every pet on hte planet, and my favorite pet is a ferret, considering they are playful and cute ^^I live in a one bedroom apartment and is fine and doesnt smell. The cage can fit in a closet. frogs are a great choice, if you get one that doesnt require a heater, but u hvae to feed them crickets, which always get out and are gross. If none of these suit you try a chinchilla , it IS a rodent, but barely, more like a funny looking hyper rabbit :D|`|qpTeX8jqaa	Tortoises are good because they are dry, harmless, can be held, can roam around, aren't messy, and they eat grass and stuff you can leave out that won't ro and stink...lettuce, carrots, grass, and the like.  Also, they are fairly interesting looking little guys.  And they don't just sit around- they are kind of active for heavy backed creatures.<br>  <br>  You can get them the size of a lemon, or as big as a football...and bigger.  They come in a lot of varieties.|`|5RXYx9c4aa	How about adopting a cat from a rescue? They're pretty inexpensive, independent and they sleep a lot. They're also very affectionate when they want to be. They're definitely one of the easiest pets to look after.|`|HULRxii5aa	What about a cat then? They spend 18 hours a day asleep and are extremely affectionate. They can either be kept indoors or let outdoors when you are not there. They are easy to take care of, as they don't need walking or cleaning out. If you get a short-haired or skinless they barely molt at all. Or fish, because they just swim.|`|048CCPp9aa	I would say iguana.<br>  I'm getting one eventually.<br>  He can wander around the house and doesnt need a heat lamp.<br>  Plus he'll sit on your shoulder if you want.<br>  There also pretty big.|`|OT97dWswaa	I'd go for a gecko, but not absolutely certain of the care conditions, a tortoise would be awesome...
0zriLTZXaa	The 2 year old is a kitten and kittens love to play. My cats do the same thing.
EqTh6LRPaa	Sounds like to me you need to have your cat seen by a specialist. In most cases you will need a referral, which will not be a problem for you since you've seen so many vets already. Your vet should be able to locate one for you. However, you might not have one close in your area. You may have to consider making a drive. But it def seems like your cat needs a specialist and should have already been referred by a vet before now. <br>  Good Luck|`|IRaIxWJKaa	I'm going to point you in the direction of one of the Yahoogroups that I think can help.  It's called Handicats, and the owners there have literally seen everything. I think if you posted this over there you'd get some feedback.  Someone may have this going on with their cat.|`|hetZz4c1aa	If possible, I would consult with the nearest veterinary college.<br>  <br>  good luck!
CyzeaoUpaa	I see it says on Petfinder that she is a "Puggle".  I would definitely agree with that.  There are two Puggles that go to my dog park that look almost just like her!|`|KxjUim7yaa	Don't see any Pug there maybe Chihuahua cross beagle . The DNA test. Don't know how reliable they are. Ask your vet.|`|OFpl236faa	I've heard the DNA test is not reliable anyway. No, you can't submit a picture somewhere. You can ask your vet for opinions.|`|w8hgR6Bfaa	get a catalog from Jeffers Pet Supplies (I think that's what its called or something similar)<br>  <br>  you can google it and order one online. I got mine less than 3 days after I ordered it. It has tons of cheap pet stuff and a DNA test is only 49.95!<br>  that's the cheapest you'll find anywhere.<br>  <br>  They send you the kit and the you take the test and rub it on the inside of the dogs cheek, send it to the company and then they send you the Breed results and a certificate within a month.|`|qlECsz0Iaa	it does say shes a pug beagle mix or a "puggle", and i wouldn't be suprised if she is that indeed.  as that is a popular designer dog and byb's and puppymills are pumping out pups of that same mix like crazy, often enough the ppl that buy them find their expectations arent meant and the dog winds up in a shelter.<br>  <br>  I have to agree, she does look somewhat like a chihuha.|`|FdcWPp48aa	DNA doesn't cost thousands.  Probably under $100.  And no, it can't be by a picture.|`|I4vPxh3jaa	that looks like a Chihuahua mix.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	There is no 100 percent way to tell your dog's breed.  Without a DNA Test.  And it doesn't cost thousands of dollars either.  And I'm pretty that their isn't a place where you send them a pic. of your dog and they tell you what breed it is.  <br>  But you can look up some dog breeds that's about the size of your dog.  Look at colors, shape of your dogs head, tails, ears.  Size of body.  And your dogs personality.  And you can see the ones that most closely resemble her.  And those would probably be the breed she's mixed with.<br>  <br>  To me she looks like a Chihuahua Mix.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|mNBhYBAfaa	lol it does look like a Chi. Go to the vet and have a DNA swab. its $100 and it will take a couple weeks but then you will find out exactly what she is made up of.<br>  <br>  <br>  or you can send me $100 and a pic and i will tell you the past 5 generations of your dog.|`|f8bazE0aaa	It says here infoo right under the picc.<br>  <br>  <br>  its a puggle....|`|4c2f3QU6aa	check the survalince camera at the local convenince store|`|EZkKZtGxaa	why does it matter?|`|2eJcaeOPaa	chiahuahu x i'd say|`|yjyd3sQdaa	very cute, do you really care, I wouldn't|`|lvXL1RjUaa	Hmmm, Im not sure about any websites with that feature but to me it looks like it deffinetly has some chihwhawha and maybe some terrier!

qdtU1Q1Laa	Buy the blanket with the highest "denier" count available. Most blankets have a denier of about 800 while I refuse to get a blanket get a blanket with less than 1200 denier as my TB is very hard on his blankets. <br>  <br>  I'd go with the Pessoa Summit Turnout Sheet (it's lightweight, but it protects the horse from the wind and rain which is what matters and has a denier of 1800!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stcroixsaddlery.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=HR_ERS_464229&CartID=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.stcroixsaddlery.com/ProductDe...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|LAXxaxAZaa	How does he rip it if he's wearing a muzzle?|`|XJ9oSR2daa	In the long run, its way cheaper to buy a high denier, and I do nothing less than 1680 myself.. If I do buy the cheaper/lesser denier models, its just a rip fest on my wrecking crew.<br>  <br>  I know its more money, but its less in the expenses to replace down the road.|`|RloOJ43haa	Is there any way you can let him go without a rug?|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	Considering you already clipped him. Next year I would NOT clip him. I don't know why people do in less you show year around. Clipping horses is just easier because people don't want to deal with sweat when they ride, so they don't have to walk their horses around to cool them off. <br>  <br>  Second. Keep him inside and for his exercise I would lunge him and take him on walks but I wouldn't turn him out any more or if you do decide to turn him out with a blanket for 30 mins and let him get his energy out and then bring him back in. Reduce his feed intake so that way he is not being hot fed and because a crazy horse. Get him some toys in his stall.<br>  <br>  Nobody is to blame but yourself for what your pony does or cannot do. Like dogs, mean dogs 99.9% of the time are because of the owners. Same things for horses. They are your responsibility and you clipped him and he does not like the blanket "rug" and its FREEZING outside  then you just screwed the pooch on that one. You going to have to figure out some sort of way to exercise him without the blanket.|`|Oiabe82gaa	You are talking in pounds sterling, so you are in UK.<br>  Do you REALLY have to rug this pony. Ponies are especially hardy, and weather in Uk doesn't get too cold so simply don't put a rug on him!<br>  This is almost spring, so he should just about be out of a rug for this winter. Allow him to go rug free all year and he will start to develop a nice thick winter coat, and will be perfectly fine next winter, thus saving you hundreds. <br>  Before emigrating from UK we had ponies and never rugged them, we simply increased their winter feed to compensate for the winter and them having to keep warm.<br>  Here in Canada it can get to -35, so our horses are all rugged, one guy in particular wrecks his, and the other guy's rug just for something to do. We are always in and out of the rug mender's shop and always have to keep a spare for each horse!!!<br>  Good luck!|`|peDwXmQJaa	It okay If a horse gets fuzzy in the winter! Thats how horses work. If your horse does not have a rug on he can ruin it.|`|PSoiKZIjaa	This is so long i barley read it. dont give him rugs

IMPvzBk1aa	Two reasons.  One is that it gives off excessive heat as it is digested....not wanted during exercise.  Second, as exercise progresses, the body will shut down digestion and intestinal motility....movement....so whatever is in the stomach will stay there, not being moved along the intestine, and not being digested. <br>  <br>   When more blood flow to muscles is needed to provide for oxygen to muscles, and for removal of metabolic wastes, the autonomic nervous system activates mechanisms to shunt more blood to muscles, and to shut down unnecessary metabolic demands that compete for blood supply, such as digestion.<br>    <br>  So, those are the two reasons not to exercise right after a full grain ration is fed.<br>  <br>  After you ride the horse, if you have heavily exercised, it is recommended that you wait an hour to an hour and a half before feeding a full grain meal.  Digestive processes have to return to full function following exercise, and the body needs time to continue metabolizing the metabolic wastes, cool down, and return to a resting state before it can optimally digest, absorb, and metabolize nutrients fed.<br>  <br>   If you are just pleasure riding, it is fine to feed right after the ride as long as the horse is cooled down first.  These restrictions apply when horses are very heavily worked.<br>  <br>   Ample cold water is fine to offer before, during, and after exercise.|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	do you like to eat a whole meal and then immediatley after run for a while?<br>  and after a workout, it can make them colic|`|qsOvzhKkaa	yes, it is dangerous to give grain before and after riding.  Eating and then working out, or eating while still hot from riding can cause a horse to colic (and possibly die).  Their digestive systems are horribly sensitive.  <br>  <br>  You should give them at least an hour (ideally 2) before and after riding before you feed them grain.|`|x787hJbBaa	The horse can colic if you ride a horse immediately after it has eaten. It's okay to ride a horse if it just had a carrot, but a meal for the horse.... I don't believe that it is dangerous to feed them after you ride, my horse gets five or six treats (they're only like a half inch long) when I am done with him and sometimes he gets a full meal.|`|3wIZiZA5aa	Its dangerous to ride after it has received its full grain ration because the horse could colic while riding because it hasn't had time to digest its food.<br>  <br>  After I ride, I cool down my horse and wait for an hour or two before feeding grain. <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!
5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Owned Great Pyrenees for years -<br>  <br>  Oh love...what a perfect dog for you!!  They are easy going.  The only time mine showed aggression was when a coyote clan came by and just 3 barks or so and they would leave.  The other time was when (we lived on a 30 acre farm) 2 men drove up our 2 mile lane and started walking towards me.  I asked what they needed while they said nothing and kept coming.  All of a sudden Tabby was at my side.  In all my years I had never seen her hair go up...she started towards them with this bark that would have made me scared had she not been mine.  I just said "boys...I think you better be moving' on" and they did just that.  She escorted them down the lane behind the truck.  I was so moved at her calm as she came back to me...backed her behind up and sat right in my lap.  (I had my legs apart so no weight on me)  She knew I was petrified and let me catch my breath.  She gave me a few nudges with her head, I buried my head into her chest and I swear I have never felt so loved....so taken care of.  My husband was working out of state for a few days.  She hated being inside but that night she came in with my pleading and laid on the floor beside my side of the bed.  <br>  My friend had one and she was 95 lbs soaking wet.  They learn quickly, are non aggressive.  They do need quite a bit of brushing, but if you keep it up daily for about 7 min. it's not a real problem.  <br>  You are going to have so much fun!  And they are sooo<br>  beautiful!|`|aCqSF87Raa	If she were to work HARD at proper training from day one.. then i don't see a problem. However i would have her think hard as these dogs need daily walks, and are very powerful. She would be the one at fault should anything happen....<br>  <br>  There was an elderly woman (smaller than me) in my last training class - she had a Golden Retriever and she could barely control the dog... would have made me very nervous if the dog had been anything but friendly.<br>  <br>  I would personally advise this person to get a smaller dog unless she is pretty strong.|`|I38WF5aFaa	That's a great breed.  They were developed for guarding livestock.  Every one I have met is very good with people and other pets.  They do get big,  about 100 pounds so start training while its still young.  The most important things to teach it are to walk on a loose leash and not to jump on people. Make sure he learns those things before he gets big enough to hurt anyone and then do the rest of his training.|`|OFpl236faa	That dog is going to get huge! Have you done any research on them?

And they are devoted family dogs. If training is done properly you will have an excellent and loving dog (they are sweet).<br>  <br>  Just make sure to buy from a reputable breeder though<br>  <br>  Size--The height at the withers ranges from 27 inches to 32 inches for dogs and from 25 inches to 29 inches for bitches. A 27 inch dog weighs about 100 pounds and a 25 inch ***** weighs about 85 pounds. Weight is in proportion to the overall size and structure.|`|S6ie5HwBaa	Rather then base your choice of breed on looks, choose one that suits your living conditons etc. These dogs are VERY active as puppies and need so much trainning and socialising not only DUE to their size when they mature, but so they become Well Mannered as Adults, No matter what All puppies should be trainned, regardless of breed.<br>  <br>  More importantly<br>  1st off Can you provide the exercise  requirement of this breed?<br>  <br>  Do you have enough room for him/her? Large fenced in yard?<br>  What happen in the middle of winter? When  it too hot for him with the heater on?  Yet it too cold for you Not to have the heater on? What will you?<br>  <br>  What your experience level? <br>  <br>  Great Pyreneese<br>  Activity:  The Great Pyrenees does not do well in apartment life, and should always have a medium to large sized yard. Regular runs off lead are best for this large dog, but supervised walks will also do. 4km daily walks & loads of mental stimulation!! They are between 85 & 100pounds! <br>  <br>  Great Pyrenees are most satisfied when guarding livestock. You can substitute pulling a cart or sled, or backpacking, or a similar canine activity, but if you simply want a pet for your family, I do not recommend this breed. Great Pyrenees were never intended to be simply household pets.  As puppies due to there size they very well may accidently knock children over!<br>  <br>  Frankly, most Great Pyrenees are "too much dog" for the average household. This is a serious working dog with tremendous strength. Very few people really have the knowledge or skills necessary to manage this breed, or to provide the activities that keep him most satisfied.<br>  <br>  If a puppy does not teeth on your possesions, it will teeth on you and your children. Rescuers often get calls from panicked parents sure their dog is about to seriously injure their children.  It usually turns out the puppy is just doing what puppies do, i.e., mouth or nip. Parents, too emotional to see the difference, just want to get rid of the dog.  A growing puppy is going to put anything and everything in their mouth. It must be taught bite inhibition. As the puppy grows, the puppy's jaws become stronger and its teeth are replaced by its adult teeth.  The mouthing and nipping it did as a puppy now can have serious consequences.  Far better to get an adult dog 2years+ that has "been there, done that, moved on."<br>  <br>  Other breed options that are Excellent with children-even  children under the age of 8year old.Contrary to popular belief, they are NOT as energetic as your lead to belive! All dogs are protective of them home, regardless of breed!<br>  <br>  Scotch Collie<br>  50-75pounds<br>  <br>  Labrador<br>  55-75pounds<br>  <br>  Golden Retriver<br>  55-80pounds<br>  <br>  Newfoundland-Can & will adapt to new homes<br>  100-150<br>  <br>  TIME COMMITMENT :-Getting a dog is exciting but owing a dog is a long-term commitment as most dogs have a life-span of 8 to 16 years. So before you take the plunge, ask yourself if you have enough time in bringing up and training your dog. You will need to devote a lot of time and patience day by day, 7 days a week commitment. Will your lifestyle accommodate your dog? Do you always have busy schedule or travelling very frequent? More time and medical attention will be needed especially when your dog is older, are you willing to sacrify your time?<br>  <br>  INTENTION AND REASON :-Many people getting dogs simply because they are cute and adorable, a nice present for their children and love ones and they always let their hearts rule their heads, they forgot the puppies will grow into bigger sizes and health problems that might arise when the dogs are older, some dog owners would then decide to sell away their dogs when this happens which I strongly discourage as this is an act of irresponsible. Ask yourself what is the intention of you getting a dog or more than one dog? Companion dogs for companion? For emotional support? To overcome your irrational fear such as fear in the dark or anxiety when being alone? Large dogs or Working dogs for protection and house watching? Top breeds for show purpose and enjoy the glory? Please refer to Dog Breeds where you can see all the different dog breeds from a-z. Whatever the reasons maybe I do believe having a good human-dog relationship can bring you therapeutic value. <br>  <br>  MONEY AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENT :-Next important thing you need to consider is about the ongoing costs for food, nutrition, grooming, medical care, accessaries, agility training fees and kennelling fees for your dog while you are away. Can you afford it?<br>  <br>  ENVIROMENT :-Giving your dog a comfortable space to live is equally important. Due to the size, activity level and temperament, some breeds need more space and fenced yard to run. Some breeds are smaller in size and more sociable maybe live indoor. Some working dogs are protective, powerful and aggresive may need to live outdoor with fenced to avoid possible of attacking stranger. So do you have a suitable place for your dog to live as part of your family? Do prepare a proper space well before getting a dog home and remember, it's going to be your dog's permenant place for him to sleep, rest, cuddle and hideout. A well trainned dog and well socialised with both people and animals and a well exercised dog WILL never<br>  ATTACK anyone!<br>  Other things to consider<br>  For my son/daughter/children . . . Trust me, this will be YOUR dog!  After the 'honeymoon period', the kids may only play with the dog, occasionally.  They may groan and grumble about any dog-related responsibilities, doing them, begrudgingly, only after significant prodding from you.  As children's interests and activities change, over the years, their level of involvement with the dog will most likely be, inconsistent, at best.  Additionally, your children, especially, young children, will need to be 'trained' in how to behave with the dog and will need to be supervised when with the dog.<br>  <br>  For protection . . . I know some may disagree but, it is my opinion, that the only time is it a good idea to get a dog for the purpose of protection is in professional or agricultural situations and only when the owner/trainer is humane and knowledgeable of dog behavior and dominant dog training/handling.  In all other situations - probably 99.9% - an alarm system, security fence, or other measures are much more appropriate and effective. <br>  <br>  To breed puppies . . . If you've read the third paragraph of this piece and still feel this way, there is probably little I can offer to change your mind.  But, just in case, let me restate the case a little more thoroughly.  The breeding of dogs is a responsibility not to be taken lightly.  If it is not your intention to remain responsible for all of your puppies for their entire lives, including being willing to take back and care for those who may find themselves homeless, do not enter into this endeavor.  If you are planning on breeding for profit, understand that there are much easier, more profitable and ethical ways to make a buck.  Dogs are living beings and dog breeding requires a significant investment of time, money, labor, knowledge, both academic and practical, patience, and emotional fortitude, to be done responsibly and humanely.  Please visit a few of the shelter and rescue websites, or your local shelter, and witness the problem yourself.  View the faces of the homeless dogs and talk to the volunteers and staff who, all too often, must take that 'final walk' with them.<br>  <br>  Because BreedX is 'Cool', was in a movie you saw, is unique and exotic, is free/cheap, or other such nonsense .  .  . One of the WORSE reasons to get a dog, or any other animal, for that matter, is because of their physical appearance or popularity due to a movie, TV show, or other publicity.  Often, these venues feature exotic, rare or unique breeds that are, in the overwhelming majority of pet situations, unsuitable as companions.  This visibility may also draw out those 'breeders' whose primary motivation is profit versus health, temperament, structural soundness and the welfare of their dogs.<br>  <br>  And, remember to incorporate the same thoughtful consideration on whether or not to get a dog, and which breed or mix, when your friend, coworker or relative offers you one of Fluffy's puppies.  Dogs are never really 'free' or 'cheap' and, in reality, require significant financial, physical, time, and environmental resources.  At a minimum, none of these, or other such reasons, are sound selection factors for getting a dog and selecting a particular breed or mix.  And, remember, if it is difficult for you to find information on a particular breed, or a breeder of the breed, it follows that you will most likely also have difficulty finding local support services that are familiar with the training, health care, and maintenance needs of that breed.|`|ToWIEN40aa	I have a dog that weights more than me. If you train it as soon as possible for it to not pull on the leash, then you should be fine. But bigger dogs mean more grooming, feeding, and exercise.

That way, you already know if she'll be gentle with the kids and controllable for you. Breed only means so much, and training and socializing a puppy is SO much work - especially Great Pyrs, which aren't easy to train and must be well-socialized so that they won't become TOO protective (i.e. protecting you from the mailman, the painters, etc.). <br>  <br>  I've been looking for an adult male Great Pyrenees myself in a few months when I move for a new job. These are the individuals that I am considering adopting: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=12145341" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=12852741" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=13082680" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...</a><br>  <br>  There are lots of wonderful, sweet Great Pyrs out there that need homes!
HrWwxRBWaa	hah, my guinea pigs do this a lot, usually when we feed the dogs because they know its time for food. They do however make this noise for no apparent reason, its nothing to be worried about :) x

Have a nice soft bed ready for her.  She is going to be busy soon.|`|YzhZCs3Naa	if she's starting to swell and show, I would say she's probably around 5 weeks. Gestation in domestic cats is between 57-70 days. When she starts to become restless and spends most of her time in her nesting area she's due any day. She'll also start to lose her appetite so don't be alarmed by that. Good luck with the kitties!!
6t5kQnSFaa	By letting your departure be so traumatizing you haven't done him any favors. <br>  <br>  The dog senses your nervousness and feeds off of it and so when you go to leave he freaks out because he can feel that you're not okay so because you are supposed to be the pack leader he assumes he needs to act as if somethings wrong.<br>  <br>  You need to set aside (a lot of time) to re-teach him how to act when you leave. I HIGHLY recommend a crate, at least in the beginning because if it takes a little while to undo the separation anxiety he may get a little destructive.<br>  <br>  If crate training REALLY gives you stress than set aside a room for him and apply the same technique I describe below to an entire room instead of just a crate.<br>  <br>  In the beginning you'll need a lot of treats and a lot of patience. You need to view your dog as family and a loved one, but a dog nonetheless. ((He's not your baby and I know it's hard, but it really will make a world of a difference.)) All dogs are hard wired into belonging to a pack - so you need to be that pack leader. If it's not okay for him to bark don't talk sweetly and in baby talk to him. He needs a firm voice to tell him what he can and can't do.<br>  <br>  Freaking out when you leave? Not okay.<br>  <br>  So, back to crate training. Little by little get him used to the crate by letting him explore, throwing in treats, gradually closing the door, then fully closing the door. Each step giving him treats and praise (ONLY WHEN HE DOES WHAT YOU WANT.) <br>  <br>  Then move it up to leaving him in the crate for small amounts of time (even if you're in the house) just to get him used to it.<br>  <br>  At first - he's going to cry. No doubt about it. DO NOT pity him and let him out. It won't help :( But I promise you that he will get used to it. <br>  <br>  Because he's already 16 weeks it may take some more time than crate training would have taken at 8 weeks, but don't give up! :)<br>  <br>  Little by little he will get used to being alone for periods of time during the day and you'll fade out the separation anxiety.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Actually crates act as a den to a dog and they give the dog a small, secure space where they can relax and feel comfortable. It makes them feel LESS anxious as, again, it is a small and dark space. Leaving them out in the open may frighten the pup more than a crate would!<br>  <br>  The best thing to do would be to give the dog a smaller space if you don't want to crate train. Maybe a cleaned out bathroom? I would NOT leave any food or water (they will just eat/drink it all and refill their bowels/bladders, thus leaving a mess.. they should be "empty" when you leave them so they do not feel the need to potty) but leave behind a toy - Kongs work great as you can stuff them with treats and it takes the dog a while to figure them out.<br>  <br>  When you leave, just leave. Don't make any sort of fuss out of coming or going. A quick pat on the head, toss the puzzle toy, then leave. Same thing when you come back except you should bring the puppy outside immediately to potty. If YOU fuss, the PUP will fuss.<br>  <br>  Dogs usually do better when left alone than we think. My puppy never made a fuss when we left her (she was crate trained though; i left behind a recorder to see if she made noise) and when i recently started leaving her in the kitchen she slept in her open crate anyway (video camera.. heh...)|`|C1eHfhrHaa	So, this dog has not been out of your sight for 10 weeks?  No wonder he acts the way he does.  He will cry and stress out about it and then he will get over it.  If you are that concerned, then take him to doggie daycare while you are gone.|`|mTTPLly4aa	Try entertaining him with his favorite toy. With this start slow. Walk out the door and stand where you can hear him but he can't see you. Only be out there for a minute and if he doesn't whine or bark then come in and give him a treat. Then do this again and again extending the time a little bit every time. If this works then hopefully he realizes that when your gone, if he is good then he gets rewarded when you get home.<br>  Keep trying!<br>  Good Luck!|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	Leave the room with no one holding him.  Let him whine when he is quiet go back to him and praise him.  Repeat and extend the times.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	You do not need to crate train him.<br>  What you need to do is to establish your role as alpha. Do not think for one moment, that just because he is so small that he automatically see you as the leader. Without knowing it you have been giving him signals through body language that he is actually the leader. That stresses the puppy out when you, the one that he should look after, just leaves. That is how separation anxiety starts. So what should you do? Do not ever again get someone to hold the dog when you have to go out. When you have to go out, just walk out, IGNORE the puppy (as in no words, no eye contact, no touch, no hugs). To make it easier on yourself, you can practice this by just walking out the house, walk through your garden and go back in. Yes he will cry - put ear plugs in your ears. When you walk in the door - IGNORE. Yes he will jump for joy. Just IGNORE until he has settled down, then call him and play. Practice this often, extend the duration of you being outside. I promise you will see a difference in less than a week. If you really care for this puppy you will pull yourself together and follow these rules. It is not fair on such a small young puppy to be forced into the alpha role.|`|2wdVqIc7aa	If you leave him out in the house he may react by tearing your things up because he is upset you left him. If you want to leave him out put some of your dirty clothes where he normally sleeps. The smell of you will comfort him. You might want to try it a little at a time over a couple of days if you can. That way he will be more used to staying alone.|`|22yL5wbzaa	First of all you are creating a dog with separation anxiety. You need to stop what you are doing.  Separation anxiety can get so severe that a dog will hurt himself and might end up on prozac and/or xanax. <br>  <br>  you need to not announce that you are leaving and just leave.  Get him a Kong and fill it with frozen pumkin or peanut butter and right before you leave give it to him it will keep him occupied.  <br>  <br>  Further, try to not shower with him in the bathroom, maybe leave him in a bedroom alone with you in the other room. do these things slowly...but do them<br>  <br>  Further, pick up ur keys and just walk around the house so he doesn't associate key knows with u leaving and starts to whig out.  <br>  <br>  Crating is not a stress on an animal.  you live in a house/apartment and that is your CRATE basically....his crate is his home, his haven, his safe place....16 weeks is not very old to start crating...u'll be happy later when he starts teething and you are not there to keep an eye on him and he destroys everything<br>  <br>  Additionally, it seems like you got this dog too young and it is missing a weening of his mother and those are the issues it has that he is very attached to you.  <br>  <br>  All in all, you must stop this pattern it is a bad habit to get into...you are only creating a dog to have separation anxiety which is a serious issue.|`|R2phurepaa	Some of what I'm about to say will echo what earlier posters have, because they're right, but here's what I did with an Australian Shepherd I fostered who had separation anxiety.  I started with very short absences and then lengthened them, so she realized I was always coming back.  I was very casual about leaving and coming back: no big goodbye or 'hello again.'  To limit frustrated or destructive behavior, I put away valuable or dangerous things, provided a chew toy, and closed off the bedroom and bathroom doors, to limit the area she had access to.  <br>  <br>  It'll take a little time.  Don't worry. If you're not anxious about leaving him, he'll take his cues from you.  He'll get used to it.|`|dhlSrrMwaa	Unfortunately the only way to get him used to it is to leave him. Keep yourself calm because they can pick up on your stress feelings, and don't praise him when you come back to the room if he is crying or freaking out, that just reinforces the nervousness. When you leave the room leave him with an old sock or dirty t-shirt of yours. Some dogs deal well with being alone if they have the sent of their owner with them. We took it one step further with one of our puppies we got really young and wrapped the t-shirt around a ticking clock and it's supposed to simulate a heart beat. We also purchased a pheromone spray. It's kind of like those deodorizer sprays that you plug into a light outlet but it puts off whats called pheromone and it is super calming to animals. Just be careful because it made my hubby sleepy too :) You can purchase it & refills at petsmart. Good Luck !|`|rkE12kcTaa	This is going to be hard. <br>  maybe you could play with him before you go out,<br>  and then maybe lay down with him and calm him. wait a bit,<br>  then you walk away into the closest room and then come back lay back down then the nest time you get up leave, it totally makes sense because if you leave the first time and he/she looks, then you come straight back, and when you get up the second time he/she will think your going to come back again.. but you won't brilliant ehh?<br>  :) Good luck and hope my advice works.<br>  Sam L.
g92UnU5eaa	I'm a believer in letting cats roam free outdoors, but there are some exceptions, and if the experts say Ragdolls really are better off indoors then who am I to argue? But since your cats are only half pedigree, why not let them decide? Aim to keep them in, but if they run amock and are desperate to get out and explore then take that as their nature. Some cats - like mine - are just impossible to keep indoors. He was miaowing at the windows, scratching at the door frames and jumping at door handles from when he was ten weeks old, he was so desperate to run free! Cats, like people, are individuals. Get to know them and let them decide.|`|hetZz4c1aa	Keep your cats safely inside and you will have no problems. Indoor cats are healthier, happier, live longer lives and are better companions.

I personally think it is cruel to force any living  creature to live in our homes, after all they weren't designed  to live in a house  but outside roaming freely. yes they should be able to come in and have your company and to be loved and cared for, but i think that they should be allowed to go outside too. to have the opportunity to act like cats, to have territories and hunt if that's in there nature to do so. you can still take pretty good care of your cat, making sure it has its jabs and  worm and flee treatments, great diet and exercise.|`|nQdGGBN4aa	It has nothing to do with breed ---<br>  <br>  It is safer to keep all cats indoors.<br>  <br>  There are no valid reasons to let a domesticated cat go outside.<br>  <br>  If you think they should go outside, it will be better from them if you don't adopt them.

Whereas in the UK, it's very common (almost obligatory! :P) to let your cats outside from an early age and only come in at nighttime or whenever they choose to!<br>  <br>  As for ragdoll cats, after a bit of research it does seem inadvisable to let them outside on their own because of their docile and un-agressive nature.. they will not defend themselves when attacked and come across as kinda dumb! :P:P.. however with them only being half breeds it might be best for them to be allowed to choose if they want to go out and roam or not? I do however agree that a cat should definitely be allowed outside as that's where they belong!.. They're very independent animals who need their own spaces and territory! But maybe supervision is needed for the first few times at least?<br>  <br>  Now, i have no idea if the asker is English, American, or from anywhere else.. but you have to consider where their from, and they sound like their from the UK to me!<br>  <br>  The asker also seems to have gotten themselves into a bit of a Pickle, but rather than seeing them Squirm, i thought i'd help them out :P<br>  <br>  :) x|`|VMY7No0eaa	my rag doll was stolen when she got out... and I didn't take the time to get her back inside.<br>  People will take a pretty cat... and that is what yours is.<br>  leaving them inside all the time is not hard on them<br>  if you bring them outside... do it only when you are there to protect them.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	you can buy harnests for small animals, put them on them, and take them outside to play<br>  good luck
iasOicRjaa	The ideal situation would be to remove the source of the allergy...<br>  <br>  If you can't do that my second favorite treatment is Atopica...since it came out I have seen it literally change the lives of dogs with allergy. It has almost no side effects, it is a capsule that you give 1x a day for the first month then you taper down to every other day or even every 3rd day depending on your dog. More than once people have said it is a "miracle" drug.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend steroids except for the short term control of severe allergies or for severe breakthrough allergy that can't be controlled with other Rx. Steroids are hard on the dog's system and they suppress the immune system.<br>  <br>  You can have allergy profiles and desensitization treatments tailor made for your specific pet. It can be expensive, requires monthly injections, and doesn't always work.<br>  <br>  For the short term over the counter treatment you can give Benadryl at 1-2mg per pound every 4-6 hours.<br>  <br>  You didn't say what the dog is allergic to so it is hard to narrow down a good treatment. Is it flea allergy? Food allergy? Seasonal pollen allergy??|`|oojO4WAraa	Talk to the vet.<br>  <br>  Also, your dog may be allergic to that Carpet Fresh stuff if you use it.  My friend's dog was allergic to that.  She stopped using it and the dog got better.  Are you using any of the sprinkle on carpet freshener when you vacume?  If so - stop using it for a while and see if that helps.|`|rVv5TC4Uaa	a good skin sensitive shampoo but first I would try to find the cause then treat it from there.<br>  <br>  Theres a good book called "Vet Secrets Revealed" in the Health Care and Common Illnesses tab  on site below that talks about common allergies and treatments.<br>  <br>  Its cheaper than a vet visit and is a good emergency book to have.|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	First check with your vet to be sure that it is allergies. Sometimes they can be allergic to a certain food that will show up on the skin (my Golden Retriever is allergic to Nutro Max), and a simple switch to another brand is all that is required. <br>  <br>  Also brush and shampoo your dog with a pet shampoo specially formulated for sensitive skin - most contain oatmeal.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, your vet can either prescribe meds, or give your dog a seasonal allergy shot.|`|2qVcpkF3aa	What's the dog eating?? What is the dog allergic to? Is it the food or is it air borne allergy?? If it's a food allergy then go with a non grain and fish based food. Wellness and California Natural makes the fish based. Corn and Wheat are a major cause of food allergies and sometimes meat too. I wouldn't bath the dog too often, maybe once every other week so that the skin doesn't get dried and start flaking. Good luck!|`|5jfEQAlwaa	Go too a place like Mud bay pet store. They will help you pick out the correct food for your dog. You can also take your dog into the store. And if it doesn't work take the food back even if their is only a little left and they will credit you for something else. I always find skin allergies really come down too the food they eat.|`|mXB6vy6xaa	First thing you need to do is figure out what the dog is allergic too.<br>  Is it a flea allergy, food allergy or something in its environment.<br>  <br>  One thing that always helps though is to stop feeding the dog table scraps.  Contrary to what many people may say, a dogs digestive system does not respond well to people food, so it is very unhealthy.  Unhealthy can manifest as bad breath, skin allergies, dull coat, bad teeth and gums, or even the extreme of cancer and tumors.  If you are giving the dog table scraps, Stop!<br>  Second, are you feeding your dog a good quality dog food?  Most dogs are healthier on a dry food diet, and there are many good quality dry foods on the market to fit any budget.  Look at the ingredients, the first items on the ingredient list is what makes up the bulk of the food.  Make sure the first few ingredients in your food are protein from a good source.  You may need to try different foods until you find one that your dog responds well too.  You can purchase small bags, or sometimes a provider will give you a free sample if you ask.  Your Vet is a good source for a food recommendation.<br>  Environmental conditions can also be causing your dogs allergy.  Flea allergies are common, and the dog does not have to be covered with fleas for it to be a problem. Just a few fleas can cause big problems if your dog is sensitive.  Treating the dogs area and eliminating the problem is a must, just be careful that the dog is not exposed to dangerous chemicals during the process.  Cedar chips in a dogs house or bed will also help keep the fleas under control.<br>  If you try these things and the dog does not get any relief, you should seek medical advise.  Skin conditions can be a sign of more serious problems with the dog, some of which are fatal, so do not wait to long if the problem persists.<br>  One last tip, if the dog is biting or chewing on areas that itch, and they will not let them heal.  I have had good luck smearing a little vaseline on the area.  The vaseline moisturizes the skin and helps with the healing process, and dogs hate the taste and feel of it in their mouths.|`|kfCxfnPEaa	My dog has skin allergies and it's pretty severe.

I know what you are talking about and I see this every year, Thank you for raising awareness about this subject|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I think its sick that people do this...and those little Easter chicks. Why are people so stupid? Its just "buy buy buy" all the time without any concern for the animals and people they are hurting.|`|fBMSIlSIaa	I personally dont even like bunnies, lol. But thats really sad and thank you for sharing with us to the people who were planning it for their kids!|`|dhlSrrMwaa	I think it's really cool that you are putting your e-mail out there for rabbit questions!! I have raised rabbits for many many years & ran a 4-H Rabbit club and it's crazy the kind of misinformation that is out there. Kudos to you!!|`|5A24XhTfaa	That just made me cry ok i know some people get animals and they hit them and hurt them and neglect them that makes me very mad!!
CvbB4qv3aa	If the hamster is 2 then its getting on in age.<br>  Try to mash the seeds nad nuts up for him and see if that makes a difference.<br>  Good luck.|`|fbReCs5jaa	Hope the following advice is helpful... (It seems he may just be having a hard time chewing as he's getting older and weaker)<br>  <br>  "Many Dwarf hamsters may bite or nip when they are younger and then mellow out as they get older. Sometimes if a hamster lives long past what is considered normal you may have to take special care of it. Some hamsters as they get older have a hard time chewing the seed mixture. This also means they can no longer bite. My hamster still tries to bite me when I handle him but he just has no strength to do so. I have had several hamsters that when they reached an age of three or more were not able to break through the sunflower seed shells or any other hard seeds and would have died of starvation. My Vet told me I could give him canned dog or cat food, baby food and any soft foods that I eat."<br>  <br>  Hope the little fellow is ok! :)|`|N9bmZLK5aa	try to boil the seeds...maybe the seeds are too hard..|`|USsjb7YLaa	chew up its food and spit it in its mouth =P|`|GwBC9JLBaa	Two years old is pretty good for a hamster. They are so small and don't really live that long. Hopefully the vet can do something for him. Best of Luck!|`|LdTnioGQaa	My hamsters always like to eat fruit and vegetables. Just cut them up small for him. But two years old is old for a hamster...|`|QsVMeaPXaa	Perhaps some banana or cooked rice? Would cereal be to hard for it to chew? I was going to suggest it soak in milk, but that may not set well with the hamster's digestive system.|`|AA10580753	hate to say it but i think the vet may put him to sleep as 2 yrs is not bad going for this type of hamster.sorry

XJ9oSR2daa	You just have to be honest.<br>  <br>  Just tell her that sometime in the future, not sure when yet, that you are thinking you might purchase another horse.  What would she charge you for room and board.  Nothing even has to be mentioned about the 25yr old horse.<br>  <br>  If she is that sensitive, then really there isn't a way she will take it easier, no matter how sugar coated it is.  Some ppl are just maniacs over the littlest things, and you can't please everyone, so really its no sense going out of your way to try sometimes.|`|Oiabe82gaa	My first opinion is what a snooty barn this is!<br>  Now, why on earth is this person gonna be offended that you want to own your own horse, she must ave known that this day was gonna come?<br>  You are going to keep it there aren't you, so in turn will start having to pay board, that is of benefit to the barn owner!<br>  If they manage to find an issue where there really is no issue then I would move barns!!!<br>  Good luck!|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	I don't think theres any reason for her to be offended if your honest. truthfully, now that your getting better at ridding, you are going to need a new, younger horse more suited for you. Just explain that, and thank her for letting you use her horse. If it weren't him you wouldn't know enough to buy your own horse:-]|`|EqTh6LRPaa	Well just tell her what you are thinking. It sounds like to me that her 25 year old geldoing is probably nearing the end of his riding days anyway. He should be turned out to pasture to be an old happy man in my opinion.|`|WhKj0yCYaa	Just say that you want to get a horse of your own. Say that your worried your working the 25 year old to hard. Just say it strait forward. because think about it, what's she really going to say to you (probobly nothing at all) either way she's getting your money for the boarding bill. I bet she'll be happy for you, and that your moving on to your own horse. good luck and don't hesitate it or else you'll never get your own horse. :)|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	You just need to be 100% forthright on your statement.<br>  <br>  Tell her that you are looking into purchasing a new horse and you were wondering the costs at her facilities. Maybe she will cut you a deal since you are hacking her 25yr old gelding. <br>  <br>  If she does bring it up that she would like it if you continued riding her horse then ask her for riding lessons (if she trains) or a reduced price in board. Its not asking a lot if you think about considering your taking the time away from your new horse and your valuable time to ride her horse to keep him occupied. <br>  <br>  If she does decide to get offended. Then you need to tell her not to place expectations on you to continue on her horse. At some point you are going to want your own horse to train at your own will ride any type of disicpline you desire. And you and I and everyone else knows a 25 year old horse isn't as capable of jumping those jumps that everyone wishes they could jump or racing around barrels. <br>  <br>  So she needs to realize your going to be possibly purchasin a new horse for endevors of your own with a new companion.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Fq94ZXhOaa	You should be honest and open with her. It is, after all your choice. A 25 year old gelding will not be up to more strenuous work, which you will know doubt will want to be doing at some point. You could just mention how you've been wanting your own horse for a long time and now you've got a chance. Say how much you've enjoying leasing the gelding and maybe as a compromise you could help find another person to lease him, maybe a friend of yours, who doesn't want their own horse. Don't worry about asking for boarding fees. I'm sure she wouldn't turn down money even if she does get a little touchy at first. Be firm and show confidence. She shouldn't have you so worried about approaching her. It's not fair of her to be intimidating for no reason. Take a friend if you need to. Good luck!|`|gkG7V0Claa	Ok. Tell the manager/owner that somewhere in the near future, not sure when or even if, you would like to get a horse of your own. That way you can call it your own and really feel like it is YOUR responsibility to take care of it. She will understand. I'm sure she knows that you love riding her 25 year old gelding, and will understand that you want to get a horse to have as your own. Tell her thank-you for letting her ride your horse and you have enjoyed it, but you need her (tell her you want her opinion because then she will really know you mean it) opinion of where to get one and what would be the right kind of horse for you. Hey she might even have a friend with a horse for sale and could sell it to you for cheap!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Just say to the owner one day Miss. whoever please can i have few minutes to talk to you privately when you are available then make it and appointment type thing then when you sit down and talk say miss whoever I am thinking about buying my own horse so I will not be able to ride your lovely gelding anymore. I thank you for letting me use him and he has been an angel. I would Love if you considered letting me ride him until I get my own horse Ithink it's Just Time for me to get my own horse because i will not ride here forever so i thought it would be nice to have a horse at home to work with all the time. I thank you once again for the use of Your horses and all that you have done fore me and taught me. thanks for meeting with me and i hope i have not offended you in anyway.|`|8bTder08aa	If the owner of a 25-year-old horse you've been leasing would get offended because you want to consider getting another horse, I think she's probably a candidate for a fool farm herself and not worth worrying about.<br>  <br>  Seriously.  Does she expect that you're going to lease this horse until he dies?  He's 25, and while he may be a fine animal, it's reasonable for you to move on.  <br>  <br>  It's my experience that people will usually take their cues from you.  If you approach this woman calmly and confidenly, with the expectation that she will respond reasonably and rationally, she probably will.  If you approach her apologetically and with a please-don't-get-mad-at-me attitude, she might take her cue from that and act offended.<br>  <br>  You don't say how old you are-- if you aren't an adult, then bring an adult with you when you talk to her.  It is unfortunate that many adults who will be snarky to a young person will be perfectly reasonable if another adult is with the young person.  <br>  <br>  If this woman is so derranged as to get offended because you are considering getting your own horse, I would suggest that you find another barn.  Life is too short to deal with crazy people on a regular basis.
oT71QN8Raa	...I have an apartment and two cats who never see the outside world.  They are pretty content about it.  I open the windows for them to get fresh air and chase squirrels back and forth along the ledge.  Honestly, it IS safer for the cat to be kept inside.  However, you do need to declare the cat to your landlord, because if there's anything in the lease about the need to do so, they can (and probably will) take the cat away from you.  They are legally allowed to do so.  <br>  <br>  And cats aren't considered wild...they are domesticated pets that were bred to be kept indoors :)  Obviously some like to be outside, but its dangerous out there...to many things can happen.  It is ultimately your choice though.  Just make sure you don't do something that will get the kitty taken away from you.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Declaring him will only make the landlord tell you he needs to be kept strictly indoors because having a cat roaming about, toileting about willy-nilly will only cause problems with neighbors.  Really, your only two options are:  1) declare him to the landlord and end his outside-kitty days or 2) don't declare him and risk the landlord taking the "stray" cat elsewhere to find a different home.  I am really am NOT trying to be mean, I promise.  I just don't see any other options.  I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  EDIT2:  You know...I was thinking...and this may seem weird, but do you have like a porch area?  Are you allowed to have pets (usually dogs) tied outside?  Cause - you COULD get a little harness for Kitty, a long leash/outside lead and tie him up :)  Put a litter box right outside your door (does he use the litter box when inside?  If not, pretty easy to teach him how too).  This way, he gets his outside-time fix and you are able to keep him.  Only trouble with this is taking the time to get him used to the harness and make sure he doesn't find a way to escape from it (thus making it pointless).  Obviously doing this means you would have to declare him :)<br>  <br>  Is he neutered?  As another poster mentioned, that might calm him down enough for you to keep him indoors if need be.  He might be desperate to get out cause there's some needy catwoman out there in need of his boycat services...something you should probably frown upon :)<br>  <br>  Oh...nother EDIT:  Does he trust you enough to let you fidget around with him?  If so..invest in soft-paws.  They are a nice little "glove" if you will for your cats claws.  With the personality you've described on the little bugger, he may manage to get them off, but its worth a try.  If you go to any pet store, they carry them and usually one box will last you about six months (or so I have heard...I've no experience with them myself but I hear good things about them).|`|7vJNHaskaa	Cats can be perfectly content indoors. We have taken in 2 over the past 3 years and they are now fully indoor cats.<br>  <br>  As for keeping him in, don't you have screens you can put in the windows...that way they can't get out? And just make sure they don't run out the door when you leave. Seems simple enough to me. Am I missing something?|`|5A24XhTfaa	OO well im sorry im confused but i guess just tell your lanlord that you have a cat and dont let him go outside?|`|hBiSNoE7aa	Keeping a cat inside is not cruel. They can adjust to living inside and have been fully domesticated for a long time. And they can be trained to wear a harness and walk on a leash. They are small animals and left outside can be eaten by coyotes and dogs, and run over by cars as well as hurt by unkind people (sad but true). And they can fight with other cats, contracting diseases and acquiring bite wounds. It sounds like the other neighbor(s) are ganging up on you and the notice was specifically aimed at you. If you do decide to keep the cat you should plan on keeping it indoors and telling your landlord. The neighbors might or might not do something to it. And it would be hard to tell if it was a stray or not (even with a collar and tags). The landlord may be afraid that if one person is feeding one cat outside, more will show up and then there will be an entire cat colony to deal with. And people seem to notice these things and will dump more cats hoping someone will take it in or feed it. So yes the landlord probably will have animal control take the cat. Since you have been there so long, maybe you should have a talk with the landlord. But be honest and I think they would listen to you. And you should say something about the pit bulls. Any dog kept indoors all the time is abuse and is dangerous since it is not receiving proper socialization or stimulation.<br>  EDIT: A cat is not a roaming mouse trap. IMO, the only place it is safe for a cat to go outside is on a large farm. The landlord can and will have the cat taken. Is he neutered? That may be why he is so crazy to get out, in which case you should get him neutered if you want to keep him.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	i too live in an apartment with two cats. they are both indoor only. my 16yr old female has never been outside. my 6yr old male used to be indoor/outdoor when he was younger. i also had some neighbor issues with him. they were feeding him, letting him in their apartment, etc. my husband was coming home one day from work and seen some lady carrying Colby. (our cat) he asked her what she was doing with his cat, she replied "taking him to the pound" he said oh the hell you are!! but anyways, the complex told us we HAD to keep him inside or he would get taken or hurt. so we learned our lesson and have never opened the door for him since! it was SO hard in the beginning. he went crazy wanting out. (yes, he's fixed) but it has died down now. he knows it aint happening. he's gave up. so i would try really hard to keep him in. the apartments due have a right to fine you and possible eviction for not telling them about the pet. all apartments are different and some are more strict than others. so just pay the pet fee and tell your nosey neighbors to get a life. LOL! best of luck to you!!
e8f83ccff6f82416a29a6f64db62373eaa	You health should come first and foremost, but there are some things you can try. First off there are medications that can help some people with allergies not be allergic to whatever is causing said allergies. Second, look into allergy reduced or free kittens, I know they geneticaly made a breed of cat that has no allergins, but there are some breeds that have reduced allergins you may be able to tolerate. (definatly cats with shorter hair) Most of the time its the cat dander and saliva that cause people to be allergic to them (can you believe they have even found cats and dogs can be allergic to their owners!). They make some sprays and shampoos that you can apply to a cat or dog to reduce their dander and counter the allergins. One type we sell where I work is called LoShed (it helps with shedding and reduces allergins pets produce). You have to spray the pet once daily for 2 weeks then once weekly thereafter. It really works well for some people and pets.|`|VMY7No0eaa	You can go to alergist and get shots... don't know how good that works.<br>  The hairless cats are not so allergy producing of the dander your allergic to.  They cost $$$<br>  <br>  I would wait until you get your farm and get some barn cats then.  I would make sure to have them SPAYED AND NEUTERED so they won't over populate too.|`|AJxl0IvHaa	get an american short haired.<br>  Or a hairless cat.<br>  ( Sphynx) They are expensive, but google a pure bred sphynx shelter.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Talk to an allergist about trying allergy meds. Some breeds of cats cause less reactions than others, Devon Rex and Cornish Rex are two of them. Sphynx cat, hairless cats, are not anywhere near hypoallergenic no matter what anyone tells you.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	I'm allergic to dogs and cats.<br>  i have a pug, which sheds ALOT.<br>  so i take a claritin everyday when i wake up.<br>  You sound more severe than me though, i don't think you can own a cat. sorry.|`|qeR967J7aa	Sorry, but this sounds kindof selfish.  When you get sick of your allergies, are you just going to toss the cat?|`|DzRLYAAJaa	Wait until you are living on your own, then you can talk to your doctor about the best allergy medicine available to you to help you with your symptoms. Then spend some time with a cat (volunteer at a pound or something) until you are sure that your allergies are under control. Then you can be safe to get one. Don't get one until your allergies are under control, because you don't want to get a cat, then take it to the pound because of your allergies. That would be stressful on the cat.|`|RxjjDSkFaa	If it is impossible to get a non-allergenic breed, then don't get a cat. Your health is more important :)<br>  But otherwise, I would recommend a non-allergenic breed because then you will have a cat that you aren't allergic to.<br>  You could also get a hairless breed.|`|AA10063288	Your health has to take precedence over your "want" for something. Research non-allergenic breeds and visit a home where they live to see how you react. If you have an attack, then don't adopt a cat you will inevitably return.|`|PSoiKZIjaa	Well, to bad so sad. Looks like someone isn't getting a kitty cat.|`|zbyd3Eoraa	yes because my daughter is allergic and has 2 in the house.You just keep on taking allergy medicine
a29qiNkvaa	I have used Aveeno on my dogs and it was ok! I just found this stuff and I am loving it! It’s called relive! <a href="http://www.petcarerx.com/pcrx/ProductPages/Product.aspx?pid=10986&k=Relief" rel="nofollow">http://www.petcarerx.com/pcrx/ProductPag...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  I just used the cream rinse and Arbonne baby shampoo and my female is doing great! By the way I now how frustrating it is! My female is an akita, know for there hair, was bald for several months. <br>  <br>  I do have a few questions thou! <br>  <br>  1. Have you have your dog’s thyroid checked?<br>  2. What foods have you tried?<br>  3. Have you had allergy testing done?<br>  <br>  It can be several other things besides food! I will not tell you what food is better. All I can tell you is what I know and have been though! My female is allergic to chicken and all grains! We did allergy testing and she is also allergic to grass, cottonwood trees, rag weed, junipers and so on! She also has a very low thyroid. Now my males only major thing is he deathly allergic to grains! We almost lost him because the vet we were going to placed him on a food that was all grains! Thinking he was allergic to all meats! Please really watch him and he looks like he getting worse please get a 2nd opinion! <br>  <br>  Angie|`|lTsDwY9Paa	No you don't have to trust your vet unless he has a second degree in pet nutrition. Has your vet run an allergy test to see exactly what foods your dog is allergic too? They do exist and are a hell of a lot better than guessing. Never use human products on a dog. Try some Oxy Med Medicated Rinse until you can get the allergy test run. It helps with itching and will soothe the skin.|`|jQKE3Jusaa	I trusted my vet, and another vet that I went to for a second opinion, and they were both wrong. sometimes you have to follow your intuition.... I have an all white english bulldog that is allergic to the world, I have tried 7 different foods, along with the z/d dog food, nothing helped until I got her off grain dog food, like most dogs with allergies, she was allergic to grain. I  wash her once every other week with aveeno body wash with oatmeal in it and I feed her canidae grain free. It was a miracle that saved my sanity and my dog.
wjwsFPMuaa	I would say it would definitely speak to your abilities. Not only your abilities but your overall experience with the German Shepherd breed in general. Plus age can factor in somewhat so having the titles to back that up will help greatly.|`|aCqSF87Raa	It certainly wouldn't hurt! Having your own well behaved dogs will be a good thing, as well.<br>  <br>  The only thing i would really look for in a trainer (other than proper building permits, business permits, and insurance) is if they had a mentor - since there aren't really any "training" colleges and you can easily print a degree off the internet, i would ask any potential trainer for the name and number of their mentor or any trainer they worked with.<br>  <br>  It takes years of experience working with dogs to actually BECOME a well known and respected trainer. You know, do hands on stuff that you may not be able to learn in a "school" type setting. It also helps to mentor under a couple of different types of trainers and maybe a behaviorist (you DO know there is a difference...?) That way you have a wider array of knowledge regarding different methods.|`|SxHu7BJCaa	if you could keep that up that would be a perfect thing|`|Mcf33eLbaa	This is a tough one Amy as I must say that even though you want to compete with your dog in UKC it takes quite a while to get to a UD level in UKC or any other kennel club.<br>  If you know what your doing, do as I did years ago.<br>  I got my start  by yes having competed with my own dog but I also befriended a couple of local kennel owners and asked if they would mind me training their dogs for competition level obedience for them.<br>  You would be surprised at how many kennel owners of pure bred dogs only show their dogs and don`t compete with them in anything else.<br>  For me, I did it for free just to start with some different breeds and of course the kennel owners also made out as I managed to get their dogs titles so they could also be able to show that the pups they would sell have or come from a working background.<br>  As well I also started by placing an ad in a newspaper trying to organize groups of folks with dogs that would train together.<br>  As well take other instructors obedince classes as you learn so many different methods by doing that.<br>  What can I say, hmmm....The only thing that will make you  successful and accepted as a trainer is to absorb as much knowledge as you can from as many differing techniques, instructors and hands on practice with as many dogs as possible.<br>  Placing a time limit on it and saying by the time your 21 by itself will just not be enough.<br>  For me while I was training and competing with other peoples dogs, I would enter some trials with as many as 3 or 4 dogs and if it was a 3 day trial would title each one of them by the last show with all normally placing in the top 4.<br>  Being consistant is how you can show your abilities.<br>  Perhaps if you have the property to do it you may want to reasearch Board and Train facilities.<br>  I know one local person with very limited experience that runs one and makes a killing doing it, as she charges $1200 a month per dog. Makes you wonder doesn`t it?<br>  Anyway I wish you all the luck in the world at whatever you chose.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless<br>  dogtrainer7 with The Ra dog always watching over me.|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	I asked a question that was sort of in this realm of subject a while back... about what people would expect out of their trainers to show they were qualified.<br>  <br>  If your target training market is people who are looking to do performance events and title their dogs in things like Rally and Competition Obedience, then yes, you are definitely going to need to have put some titles on some dogs.  My instructor has titled dogs right up to the utility level in AKC competition obedience and she also does Rally and Agility.  A CD is a great accomplishment, but it isn't enough in my book.  Several CDs, CDXs and a few Utility titles make me much more at ease giving my money to train with that person.  I know that someone with that number of titles they have put on dogs not only can train for competition obedience, but has also got plenty of ring experience to go along with that to share with their students.  Competing in obedience is more than just getting the dog to work with you, you still gotta know the ins and outs of competing in any particular venue.<br>  <br>  As for the age thing, titling before 21, it's nice, but that isn't really going to be a big deal.  The age you learn doesn't matter.  What you learn and can bring to the training table does matter.  I know plenty of 4H kids with titled dogs, but that doesn't mean I am going to expect them to be good teachers.<br>  <br>  Keep pushing forward.  Title your dog as far as you can and in as much as you can.  Get that next dog when you are ready and begin working on that dog.  Do the same.  Title as far as you can in as much as you can.  Having numerous dogs with numerous titles/acheivements shows that you can be a consistent trainer.  That is really, really important.  Oh, and people skills are a must too :c)

Only use the filter if you are POSITIVE that it will take care of 20 gallons. Also, scrub all of the equipment with hot water to get rid of the bacteria. Make sure you wait 24 hours before putting any fish in. <br>  Good Luck!|`|jnzSz3tRaa	it will be faster<br>  probably about 2 weeks until you can put them in|`|0WyFs0q0aa	it will work trust me 20 year experiance with fish|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	I actual recommend that.  It helps the tank break in faster.<br>  And take the water from you next change and put that in the new tank.  This should break it in rather quickly.  <br>  <br>  I'd do a test on it every 4 days and compare that with you existing tank. <br>  <br>  If you upgrading the tank I'd just take the water out of the small tank (All of it) and use that.  I've done that several times and it went rather quickly.  Same day because I was using all the same water and filters.
urrmckQBaa	If you want to keep the fry then keep an eye on her and when she is huge and starts hiding places put her into a birthing trap (a little box that sits on the top of your tank that mom goes in) then when she is done birthing take her back out and the babies can stay there for a while. When they get bigger move them to another tank as they will still be small enough to be eaten. Good luck! x|`|tShDXmgbaa	If she is prego and you keep her in the main tank thru the entire pregnancy...chances are if the fry don't make it to a hiding spot after the take their first breathe of air to fill their swim bladder with air, they will be eaten by tanks mates as well as mom if she can catch them. If you move her to a breeding net that allows the fry to drop thru a little compartment...all your fry will make it past birth but even still only the strong ones will survive. You will need to put mom back in the main tank after she gives birth and the fry should be moved to as they dont do well in breeder nets if left too long as the nets tend to hold stagnant water and uneaten food which is deadly to baby fish.  Baby fish/fry should be feed flake foods crushed to a powder consistency if you move them from the main tank.
hetZz4c1aa	It doesn't sound like this is the best time for you to have a cat.  But you could bring the kitty a treat occasionally and that would brighten the day for both of you.<br>  <br>  If the cat appears healthy and happy, I would not call a shelter.  Chances are very good that the kitty will not be adopted and will be euthanized.  You can also ask around and see if there is someone who might be able to "adopt" him.<br>  <br>  good luck and thank you for your kindness!|`|DXzI2jrEaa	Years ago an abandoned cat who was very sick showed up on my doorstep.  I was laid-off but working part-time and finishing my college degree. There wasn't much money, but I couldn't let him die so I took him in and scraped up enough money for the vet. I became very attached to him and decided that I'd just have to find a way to take care of both of us which I did.  He lived with me for the rest of his life.<br>  <br>  I think your decision should be based on what you expect your future to be and what you think you can provide for the cat until then.  You can read up on cat care, make sure your home is clean and safe, and provide a loving home to an unwanted cat.  Otherwise, you can at least take to cat to a shelter.|`|EqTh6LRPaa	If you cant afford it, which it doesn't sound like you can by your own admission, call your local animal shelter and they will provide your a humane trap and then you can take it back to the shelter where the cat will get proper care.|`|FvMtam2Aaa	Are you on the computer at the library or what?

There may be ways out there you could get help with caring for the cat. But you might want to do some research first. The resources available depend on where you live and other factors. And they provide great companionship--even when they are ignoring you ;-). <br>  --You could try to take the cat to a shelter yourself.<br>  --You could call the local animal control and tell them about the cat, and they can come get it. But it may take them a couple of days or longer.<br>  --You could take the cat to your home where it would be safer and try to find it a new home (post ads on petfinder, cragslist, and kijiji and ask your local rescues and shelters and ask friends and family)<br>  Don't be bothered by what other people say about being able to afford pets. I think the love they receive is more important, provided they have food and are not in any immediate danger. If the cat looks skinny it is definitely not anyone's pet. If it is fat and you are able to determine it is a female it may be pregnant and if you take it in it will need extra care.|`|dXn8JaZjaa	with as many complaints as you have, no, don't adopt it. you can try feeding it if you think it is hungry, maybe take it and get it neutered. see if your dad will let you keep it before you just bring it home. how old is it. male or female? can you afford to buy litter box, litter, food, etc? that might be the deciding factor for you.|`|a094e88abfa530c89b6055e83ffcca55aa	your reasoning to own him is sound but if he is a stray you will have to let him out.

j2Fkp5X2aa	Guide or seeing eye dogs are always on leash. The dog has both the harness and a leash. They usually have 6 ft long leahes, which are looped in half, and so the length is only 3 feet when held by the handler. It has clips on both ends and can easily be cliped on to one end or both ends. When the harness is on, the leash is also on. The handler holds the leash and harness in the same hand. When the dog is not being used as mobility device, ie. in a resturant, while waiting for a bus, etc the handler holds the leash, but lets go of the harness. Since these dogs are trained to lay quietly the leash will not get caught up, and it can be held by the hanlders foot, etc which means that the person can have their hands free for other things.<br>  <br>  While it may be appropraite in some situaitons, ie the workplace to let go of the leash, to the person who said guide dog users would not have the dog on leash at a bus stop is crazy. Dogs at most have the mentaltiy of a 3 year old. Even the best trained dogs make mistakes and a blind person cannot know what their dogs are doing, since they cannot see them. Letting go of a leash inside is one thing, but at a bus stop is just beyond comprehension. <br>  <br>  I personally cannot imagine a situation in which any service dog should need to be offlead. Leash laws are designed to protect the dog. Public access laws are not about giving the disabled special privillages but rather about providing resonable accommodations. Rights only exist along with responsiblities and people have a responsibility to put the comfort and wishes of the community into account. People feel safer when dogs are on leashes. Having them in public places on leash is about respecting the rights and needs of everyone. It comes down to basic respect, and above all else the welfare and safety of the dog. All dogs make mistakes and to expect to be quick enough to say something to stop the dog, assuming you even see the dog if it is offleash is crazy.|`|XEbe4Votaa	I cannot think of any reason a service dog should be off leash.  (or off harness in some cases)<br>  <br>  Maybe somebody can jump in and give a reason that I'm just not thinking of...until then I see absolutely no reason they shouldn't apply under the same laws.<br>  <br>  (In fact, in every situation I can think of, they might be the most important dog to have leashed simply because their owners depend on them and could be in serious trouble if they were to get loose.)|`|aCqSF87Raa	I don't think they should be exempt from ANY general laws (other than where they are allowed to go.) All dogs should be on lead, all dogs should be vaccinated, etc. Why should these dogs be exempt? <br>  <br>  Isn't the general thought that ANY dog can react in any way to any situation....?<br>  <br>  PS - Unless the person is physically unable to hold the leash/harness (which, i've heard that they provide handlers for dogs who belong to people in these situations) that is!|`|tY14vbrKaa	First, define "service dog".  Some dogs are "service dogs" and their "service" is companionship.  They're often just typical dogs with typical (minimal) training.  Should that dog be leashed?  Absolutely.<br>  <br>  If you mean an actually dog that is WORKING with a handler--again, we need to look at the work.  A seeing eye dog will be harnessed--obviously-- so the owner is attached to them.  Also, there are often assistance dogs that aid in shopping, etc--they're often needed to reach up to get bread off of shelves, etc.  If this animal should be leashed, it should be long enough to allow it the freedom it needs to do it's job.  And of course, there's HRD (human remains detection) and SAR (search and rescue) these are "service dogs" and they obviously can't do their job on leash.<br>  <br>  If you just have some unruly therapy dog who is your "mental health pet" and it's some yappy Chihuahua who should be confined at all times when out of the house, then absolutely yes--it should be leashed.<br>  <br>  The answer is never black and white--but oh so many shades of grey.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Companion Service Dogs ARE legally defined.  They're allowed in apartments and rentals where "no pets" is the rule, also on public tranport, etc.  They're often nothing other than an excuse to tote your animal all over the place, but regardless, they're allowed where "pets" are not--though they're often just a "pet" anyway.|`|AA11026827	I don't believe they should be.  You never know when something might happen or an unforseen situation comes up.  It's always better to have them leashed so there is some control just in case.  It also makes the public feel more safe (surprisingly a lot of people are afraid of dogs, even service dogs/animals).  Even seeing eye dogs have the harness (which I consider similar to a leash in this situation), and they're on a leash too, for control.<br>  <br>  It just seems like a control and safety thing to me, as well as for the comfort of the public (I love dogs, but people who are afraid wouldn't want an unleashed service animal on the city bus, or to pass it on a sidewalk).  Also, sometimes they are trained different behaviors for on the leash and off, which could create an issue if the dog is off leash.  (Seeing eye dogs are "free" in a sense when their harness isn't on, and they are allowed to not be as restricted in their rules, and they know it.)<br>  <br>  Those unable to hold a leash (I've seen one accompanying someone in a wheelchair), normally have another way to hook the leash to their person (or in this case wheelchair), and the dog has been trained as such as well.|`|Bw18seFqaa	hmm good thought..  however most service dogs ussually do have some kind of leash or other devide (harness with handle) that the owner holds on to.  The animal recognizes that its "working" when he has the equipment on.|`|KxjUim7yaa	A seeing eye dog does not need a leash because it has a special harness. A dog that is a psychological service dog should have a leash and most likely should be small enough to be held by the owner if getting on public transportation. I think it depends on the situation and the law should be Flexible.|`|0747fea6c45bf75b7874aeb315e68a95aa	Because some service dogs need to work off-lead, I would agree that those dogs should be exempt from leash laws if, because of the nature of the tasks that they were performing and/or the nature of their handler's disability, they needed to be off leash in order to assist their handler. <br>  <br>  If exemption from leash laws would be considered a reasonable accommodation for the disabled handler who needs the dog to work off-leash, then that accommodation would need to be made in order for the locality to be in compliance with the ADA. <br>  <br>  I don't think every service dog would need to be exempted, although I can see localities choosing generally not to enforce leash laws for service dogs just to avoid the headache of trying to determine whether exemption was reasonable on a case-by-case basis.|`|vJg5k342aa	Yes.  Whether or not a service dog remains on leash should be left to the handler's discretion.<br>  <br>  However, in most cases, leashes should be used.  Service dog or not, dogs are dogs and will act as dogs.  Most circumstances don't require a service dog to navigate more than a leash length away from the handler but certain disabilities may require tasks that must be performed off leash.<br>  <br>  I think those who are against exempting service dogs from leash laws need to consider the potential need for off leash work.  Most service dog handlers are aware of their needs and their dogs' limitations so if off leash work isn't needed, they won't do so.|`|pvm8wo9Waa	I can't think why any animal should be exempted from leash laws with the possible exception of a police dog, search and rescue etc. while working if his duties require that (I don't know enough about these jobs to know the requirements).  <br>  <br>  In my understanding, the leash on a service dog is there as a safety backup; its there to protect the dog.  Properly trained service dogs work on voice command and or hand signals and not from leash signals or restraint.  But I cannot think of a situation where having one off leash would be either justified or any real advantage. <br>  <br>  That said, I also believe having a leash on the dog and holding it in an alternate manner, such as under your foot or attached to your waist or over your shoulder, still counts as a leashed dog.  Not everyone is born with the advantage of having 3 hands when doing something else while working with their dog (grin).<br>  <br>  Edited to add, if wearing a working harness, dogs typically also wear a leash because the handler (depending on the type of work the dog does) generally does not signal the dog with the harness since the dog uses the harness to pull or guide the person (depending). So any signals to the dog are verbal or if the dog does not respond correctly, are cued again through the leash.|`|bECsJtvDaa	I see your point, but I'm sort of torn between two answers.<br>  In a way they should because not only are they more obedient than a pet, but they sometimes (rarely, but sometimes) needed to be off leash. <br>  But again, to ensure that the dog stays with it's owner and doesn't get distracted from it's work and plus sometimes the leash is needed to help pull the owner who is in a wheel chair, although they are mostly holding on to the dog's vest. <br>  Also there are some Service Dog users who would idly use this for their own purposes. <br>  This is a very good discussion topic, though I have no straight answer.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	I see no reason why they should be exempt from any law pertaining to dogs with respect to leashes or harness, for the safety of everyone involved- including the dog.|`|hcCZwBgyaa	yes because they need to help their owners|`|c0ab280c9166f6cd89a7d926bfdfc24daa	A guide dog in a harness is not always being held. Sitting at a bus stop the person may let go of the harness. So they would be violating leash laws in some places. If the blind user also had the dog on a leash for these frequent occurrences, there is a good chance the leash would get tangled when the dog goes under a table or something. Most people do not sit still and the world does not stay still around them. The owner would not be able to see if the leash wrapped around a chair leg when the chair was scooted, or if the dog came out from under the table a different route. <br>  <br>  So a strict leash law would not be appropriate in some cases. Sure the dog has a harness, but the person's hand is not glued to it, which is good because people need to be able to use a public restroom without worrying how to hold a leash.<br>  <br>  There may also be people with limited mobility who use service dogs to get their bags or open doors. If a leash is attatched to the wheelchair since the person has limited use of their hands, the dog may have difficulty getting to the other side of the chair to push a button. So it is an individual thing.<br>  <br>  Not all dogs can work off leash. And I would not want to leave my dog on the subway because we got separated while getting off. But if I get sick while his leash is attatched to me, he cannot go get help. He would only be able to get help if I had been holding the leash in my hand and let go.<br>  <br>  The purpose of a service dog is to mitigate a disibility. It would be unreasonable to expect a disabled person to have hold of a leash of a trained dog 100% of the time. That is undue hardship in some cases.<br>  <br>  Many people with disabilities would have extreme difficulty stopping a dog that decides to bolt. So in that case it is almost irrelevant to use a leash to stop a dog from running into traffic.<br>  <br>  I think all service dogs should have a leash or harness when walking in a public place,  especially stores. A person in a wheelchair could put a harness on the dog but have them walk beside them. That would give the impression that they are leashed/ harnessed. But when it is time to laydown for mealtime or play, they should not have to be on a leash. <br>  <br>  It takes discretion. For the most part a dog should be leashed or harnessed. But the point of the dog is greater freedom, not less. And in many cases it could be a reasonable accomodation.|`|FcnEpRvUaa	To the poster who mentioned "emotional" service animals, they do not exist. ESAs are permitted in "no pets" housing and on airplanes for the purpose of emotional support but have no access to areas like the doctor's office, and grocery stores. (they're also called emotional *support* animals not service).<br>  <br>  As far as the actual question, I don't see a need for a dog to be off-leash. A harness for a physical support animal and a guide dog should count as a leash in my opinion, but otherwise there's no reason a service animal shouldn't have a leash on at all times. Even as incredibly trained as a service animal is, things happen, dogs aren't infallible and they need the extra security of a leash so a quick tug can remind them of what they're supposed to be doing.|`|AA11830350	No. The only time a legally defined service animal should be off leash is if it is required to perform a task such as getting help. Leash laws are there as much to protect the dog as they are the public. No matter how well trained the dog, if something is enticing enough they may well fly into traffic to get it.|`|GFvrzi6faa	ALL dogs belong on a lead. Especially Service Dogs and Guide Dogs  and Hearing Dogs. There should be NO exceptions.... ever.<br>  <br>  It is a matter of responsible protection and safety for the handler, the dog, and the public.
2HKSwHkSaa	Yup, probably separation anxiety as was already mentioned.  If you are keeping her in her crate, you may want to throw a blanket over the crate so that she may be alone and calm down.  Or, they do make a product (sold at most pet retailers, like Petsmart or Petco) that has a buzzer that goes off when the animal barks.  The sound is not pleasing to the dog, so they will not bark when the buzzer is around.|`|mH5jEhbHaa	well give it more time its still a puppy.And if that still doesn't work look for a dog babysitter my friend takes care of pets all the time.trust me it will work.|`|I4vPxh3jaa	this is her saying she doesn't want to be left alone. she is a puppy, a baby. this is only too natural. a handy tip is that when you leave her alone, play some classical music for her. this fills the silence so no barking and relaxes the dog.<br>  if you do not already then put some soft toys, chew toys and a soft blanket in the crate with her for comfort.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Sounds like separation anxiety.<br>  Have you given her something of yours that you no longer need, it reassures & calms them. You could also try leaving the tv on low or with just the pictures or even a radio or a ticking alarm clock, the noise reassures them.|`|a5CEuWDxaa	Hun its just for attention, like when babies cry for attention :)<br>  <br>  When she barks just say "No!" and if she doesn't listen tap her on her nose ( its like a little punishment ).<br>  Apologize to your neighbours but mention shes just a pup and still learning!|`|sI58cE4maa	There are many reasons dogs bark. The folks at Paws Awhile Online Community have a great podcast on this subject. You can download it at www.pawsawhileoc.com|`|MKuDawP7aa	A common problem that occurs between dogs and owners comes from how the pet reacts to being left alone. In this type of situation, we have to keep in mind that our puppy is a pack animal. He was not built to be on his own. The whole point of living in pack is to be able to live as a group and work together, play together, hunt together, and raise puppies together. Every puppy was made from this same mold. Being alone does not come naturally to him.<br>  <br>  With proper care and training, we can help him adjust and accept staying alone. You need to be sympathetic and determined when training your dog to accept your necessary absences. You must show him over and over again that you will come back and give him love, take care of him, and fulfill his needs.<br>  <br>  You will need to set up a crate or den area for your puppy and establish a permanent location for his water bowl and food dish. He will also need a blanket or towel to sleep on and papers or potty pads to relieve himself. Give him safe toys to chew. Chewing will help him relieve his anxiety. Keep this in mind if he chews on your shoe one day in an attempt to make himself feel better. It is anxiety, not spite that makes him do bad things when you are out. However, you must still correct him. But you also have to understand that while your pet can adjust to being left alone, it is not a natural state for him and he is never going to like it.<br>  <br>  Your comings and goings during the first few days of acquiring your puppy will help to communicate to him that you will come and go. Some puppies adjust easily while some will find this area very difficult. Naturally, if you have a breed that was originally developed to herd and protect a flock, he will tend to get upset when his flock disappears. Understanding the qualities bred into your dog for generations will help you predict his behavior and how he will react to certain situations such as training, how he responds to children, and being left alone.<br>  <br>  Giving your puppy something to do to keep him busy will help when he is left alone. He should have safe things to chew. Another pet, such as another dog or a cat, will also help ward off lonely feeling. In addition, you can help him feel better by giving him a good exercise right before you leave. This will tire him and relax him. Furthermore, you can train him before you leave for the day. This reminds him that you are the leader of the pack and also reminds him of his security as well as his limitations. He will therefore feel less anxious knowing that he has a loving, firm, and fair master. You can even leave the radio on while you are gone. Music and voices are a great comfort to a puppy who has to spend the day alone.|`|RdeoVdlIaa	i had the same problem with my puppy. she probably is scared to be alone, besides she's young. if you got her from a pet store chances are she was from a puppy mill, neglected and left alone in a cage. eventually when she's older, she'll feel safer with you and will gwt used to her cage. try to get her to like her cage, give her treats when she goes in and put toys in there.<br>  hope i was some help!|`|RBGlBYRJaa	Maybe that could be a sign of her missing you? .

Its possible for a horse to be brown with a black mane and tail (bay). But a horse that is dark brown is dark brown all over...Unless they have the have the silver gene (I believe its called silver but I could be wrong)...anyways that causes their mane and tail to be flaxen (blond-ish color).|`|RUxRNsf4aa	You said dark brown with a black mane and tail? yes, its possible.

Rw7gi86Naa	That all depends on your cat's age and temperament. Has she been around other animals before? Older cats tend to  be less tolerant of a new ranbunctious kitten. If she's older I would suggest adopting a cat that is at least a year old. Usually pairing a male and a female together has a better outcome than two same-sex cats. Make sure they are both neutered and spayed before they meet, of course. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you haven't brought the kitten into your home yet, when you see him next wipe him or her down with a towel and bring it home with you.  Set it very casually on the floor, and let your cat approach it, (don't bring your cat to the towel like you're showing her, let her find it on her own).  If you have plenty of time in advance, then leave the towel around for several days, and even bring more towels with the kittens’ scent.  Place them several places in the house, in the same way you “planted” the first one.  It may also be helpful to rub your cat down with a towel also and bring it to the kitten.<br>  <br>  When it’s time for the kitten to come home for the first time, as you are distracting your resident cat, have a friend, (someone who doesn’t live with you) bring the kitten in and place him or her in a room with the door closed.  Also ask your friend to get the food and water dishes and the litter box set up in the closed room.  Include toys and a bed, (or just a box with towels).  The litter box should be in the opposite side of the room from the food, water and bed.  DO NOT set up the kittens room before you bring him or her home.  This will only confuse your cat.  The point is to make your older cat think that the kitten suddenly, (and magically!) appeared, without your knowledge.<br>  <br>  Your cat will approach the door and pick up on the scent of the kitten.  Don’t get discouraged or worried if you hear some hissing and growling, as this is very common.  For the first couple days, spend a limited time in the room with the kitten and make sure to give your resident cat plenty of affection, even more than usual. Another helpful thing to try is to attach two toys with a string, and leave them on opposite sides of the door, so the cats can play together. <br>  <br>  Cats are very territorial animals, and this is why you don’t want her to see the kitten as an intruder that YOU brought home and shoved in her face.  Cats are very much creatures of habit and routine, so when her routine is disrupted, don’t be surprised if she becomes very angry.  You must be the judge of when they should meet face-to-face, but don’t push things too quickly, it may take a few days of sniffing each other under the door before they have settled down.  When you believe they have calmed down and are ready, casually open the door a few inches.  Remember, you are being nonchalant about this; do not force them on each other.  You should pick a time after both cats have just eaten; feed them a treat that you know they will love, (like some of their favorite cooked meat).  They will be content and their bellies will be full, so they’re less likely to want to exert a lot of energy in a cat fight.  Supervise them and don’t be surprised if the older cat swats at or fights with the kitten.  Don’t step in and separate them unless someone’s getting hurt worse than just a scratch on the nose. The kitten will probably retreat into his or her room at which time you should close the door.  Increase the time you allow them to interact each day.  Don’t leave them together unattended until you are confident that they comfortable with each other.  Be patient.  It may take a few weeks or even a few months, but if all goes well they will soon become the best of friends.<br>  <br>  Extra tip: to ease the initial tension of introduction, rub each cat down with brewer's yeast powder. Brewer's yeast is available in natural food stores. It's all natural, full of vitamin B, and will actually go good for the cats to lick it off. The smell of the brewers yeast helps disguise the foreign odors and each cat will basically smell the same. Don't use anything like baby powder because the talc isn't good for the cat to breathe or ingest. You should use the same grooming tools (combs, brushes, towels, mitts) on both cats to transfer their scents to one another.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZG2ZmcjDaa	I have 2 cats.<br>  The first one I had by itself for about 7 years,  then I got another kitten,<br>  and the kitten had no problem with the first one.<br>  But the original cat hated the new kitten.<br>  It took them probably a year before they got along.<br>  Now they sleep in catbed together,  so  cute.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|VMY7No0eaa	depends on her age... my females would mother kittens (after an initial getting to know each other period) <br>  my males (siamese) would too. <br>  THEY HAVE TO ESTABLISH who is ALFA ... so that takes a while <br>  give it a couple of months. <br>  if it is an OLD cat 8 yrs + then possibly it will never accept the kitten .|`|KILFoc6kaa	It all depends,every cat is different.  My big momma cat has always been accepting of all our new animals dogs, cats, male and female.
DXzI2jrEaa	Edit:  Your additional details helped.  Here's a simple, inexpensive solution that I have successfully used with my cat.  Buy a can of 100% natural pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling).  Offer 1/2 of a teaspoon (no more than that) to your kitten.  If he/she won't eat it, mix it in some canned cat food.  If your kitten won't eat the food, buy a needless syringe and give it that way.  The pumpkin will add additional fiber to her diet, and the diarrhea should be gone the next day.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, this actually works.  I gave it to my kitten after she decided to have a drink of soapy dishwater and got loose stool as a result.  The next day, and since then, she has been fine.  And by the way, she ate the pumpkin straight and now prefers it over cat treats.  :--)  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DuFUWSLoaa	Naturally, you can investigate what food your cat is eating.  Make sure it isn't toxic, like peanuts or some fruit, could be the case.  Or, it could be the type of cat food.  My cats get diarrhea when they eat watery things like fancy feast, not a dry food pebble.  Otherwise, make sure you get him to a vet.  Just keep in mind, that if this is serious, medication will have to take place.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If he's not better in another day or so, then get him back to the vet.  Cats can be sensitive to changes in food.  A sudden change (especially with dry foods) can cause problems.<br>  <br>  You can try some cooked rice and hamburger and mix it together for him and see if that helps.|`|hetZz4c1aa	Naturally often means cheap.  Diarrhea is serious in kittens and if not treated properly can be fatal.  Please take the kitten to the vet.  And, schedule an appointment for the required vaccinations and decide the age for spay/neuter.<br>  <br>  good luck!
Rw7gi86Naa	Often older cats who start to lose their hearing will behave like this. It may put your mind at ease if you make an appointment with the vet, just in case.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Maybe he's saying "Howold I am".

IFEIP5Doaa	A snow leopard gecko is a morph of a leopard gecko, same species just different colors and patterns, just like you will have blizzards, high yellows, tangerines, and patternless,which tend to be some of the easier to find leopards. Mac Snows tends to cost a little bit more. If you are refering to the all white leopard gecko, that is the blizzard leopard gecko. But one thing you must realize, although they are all the same animal, leopard geckos are not a desert animal, they are an arid animal. desert when comming to mind is sand, hot hot hot, little water. These guys come from a rocky area with humid caves, and the land isnt very sandy.

If it was flea stuff she should definitely go to the vet because that stuff can be very toxic, don't use that at all unless its from the vet. <br>  <br>  My guess is she's most likely upset from the bath, but she could have gotten like ear infection or something from it so I'd take her to the vet for a check up. <br>  In the future, unless she got into something gross you don't need to bathe her really? Its healthier for their skin/fur if you can just let them clean themselves.|`|PGQoh45Uaa	My cat useto  be exactly like that playful, carrying, and fun to be around with, but then he just got all boring, but don't worry he is great !<br>  He sleeps all day, eats, and poops in my room !

RUxRNsf4aa	You are right, it is very uncomfortable if you were a pad. I use tampons, because it is MUCH more comfortable when bouncin around in a saddle and most of the time, you can even tell a difference! But I do recommend wearing a pantyliner with it, just in case.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit----<br>  <br>  Itty bitty_84, dont scare her about tampons! Toxic shock syndrome usually  occurs form leaving a tampon in way too long, and even then it is rare.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	definately tampon- I can't stand pads anyways- I got my period in 5th grade, and switched to tampons by the end of 6th grade. They feel like diapers to me, no matter how skinny they are :)<br>     I would think with a pad, it would get torn up or shifted as you rode, because of being rubbed against the saddle. Plus, with pads (in any situation) you are much more likely to leak.<br>  <br>  And yes, you can get toxic shock syndrome from tampons, but that is if you are allergic to them ( I think it is less than 5% of the population), and once you remove it, you are fine. I had a friend who was allergic to them and would pass out if she tried to wear one. If you leave it in for a lot longer than you should be (ie 16 hrs or so), you also run into increase the risk of TSS. You need to change them every 8 hrs or so, if not sooner, depending on your flow.|`|5TCewPYRaa	I prefer Tampons---honestly pads are just nasty---you have to sit in your own guck until you have time to change it (especially gross at shows in the summer!) Also with pads you risk having the pad move and getting a leak through your undies, pants and onto your saddle seat (particularly troublesome if you have a suede seat--forever red spot?) <br>  <br>  I find that the Playtex Sport Tampons are the best for riding--I also put a pantyliner on for added backup protection<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck--for cramps try an icy-hot back patch--you can keep them on while you ride and they are basically the best thing for riding with cramps because the heat helps a LOT<br>  <br>  BB|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	Depends on you.<br>  <br>  Some women need to change their tampons a whole lot more than others. I have worn both just depends on my body at that time. Sometimes I have worn one or the other because of well..... me and aunt flow.|`|l42UDjFGaa	Tampons definitely...the best ones for riding are Playtex Sport! Night and day between the usual design and the sport design. Give 'em a try.|`|x84d9yInaa	Tampons, they're much more comfortable.|`|peDwXmQJaa	Tampons no question|`|DLxh9CANaa	I generally wear a pad which has the "wings" on the sides for stability, and I have NEVER HAD A PROBLEM with them bunching up, turning rock hard, or any of that other nonsense some of the people here are talking about. The only time I wear tampons is when I am swimming during my period, and I am careful to remove the tampon as soon as I get out of the pool and have changed out of my swimsuit. <br>  <br>  Toxic Shock Syndrome IS a RISK associated with tampon useage, but it amazes me how many people on here know so little about it. Half the comments I've seen so far are totally FALSE, and the others are teetering on the brink of being so. If all of you young ladies feel like you should give the asker some advice about this, how come you can't EDUCATE YOURSELVES at least a little bit, so that the advice you give is sound? TSS is an infection caused by the bacteria Staphylcoccus Aureus, which has MANY different subtypes. Some of these are probably familiar to a lot of you, thanks to the coverage they've gotten in the news media. MRSA, or Methicillin Resistant Staphylcoccus Aureus, is perhaps the most famous one of these. TSS is NOT caused by MRSA, but by its close relative. Symptoms of TSS include the following: a sudden, HIGH fever ( in excess of 102 degrees) during your period, nausea, dizziness, vomiting, fainting or near fainting when standing up from a sitting or reclining position ( which is called syncope by medical professionals) and a red rash which looks a lot like a sunburn. Some women also have a sore throat, muscle aches, extreme fatigue, and weakness, along with sensitivity to light and sounds. If YOU, the asker, experience ANY ONE of these symptoms, or several of them, call 911 IMMEDIATELY, or have someone do it for you if you cannot. Tell the dispatcher that you have your period and that you were using a tampon, so that he or she can pass this information to the paramedics. You'll need immediate medical treatment, with IV antibiotics. Untreated, TSS is almost ALWAYS FATAL- which is why all boxes of tampons carry a WARNING LABEL about the disease. Current research indicates that the infection happens in about 6 to 10 women out of every 100,000 who are menstruating or are of childbearing age. Of the total number of victims, approximately 5 % have DIED from it, which is where the statistic that one of the other writers here reported came from. ( That information is based on data from the CDC's website.)<br>  <br>  TSS is preventable. The secret to avoiding it is using common sense and good judgement when you wear or use tampons, along with practicing good hygiene. If you choose to wear a tampon when you ride or take lessons, then the recommendation is that you should remove it as soon as you are finished riding. This also applies to other sports. NO TAMPON SHOULD EVER be left in place for more than 3 to 5 hours at a stretch, for the simple reason that tampons make perfect breeding grounds for the bacteria which cause TSS because they are warm and moist. What makes that bacteria so dangerous is not so much the organism itself, but rather the TOXIN which it produces as a by product of its metabolism. That toxin is what makes women and girls who use tampons sick. The tissues in the vaginal area are very thin, and it's easy for a poison like that to be absorbed through them- and when a person gets enough of the poison in her system, illness will follow. TSS can also happen in women who are post menopausal, in MEN, and in young children, but it's much more rare in these groups. Another point to keep in mind about tampon use is that if you want to keep from getting sick, you need to use tampons which have the LOWEST absorbancy rating, not the highest. Lower ratings mean less chance for the bacteria to breed and gain a foothold in your body, which helps protect you. Lastly, it's extremely important to keep yourself CLEAN, and to WASH YOUR HANDS when you change your tampon or pad, or go from one to the other. <br>  <br>  You can wear a tampon when you ride- just be cautious and prudent about it. Good luck.|`|8XxMQyksaa	hahahaa, i have answers this question about 1,000,000,000 times. P-A-D-S~you can't go wrong. <br>  mk lets give an example, when your riding with a pad, its like wearing a cussion under your pants, acctually helps hitting your area! but it your have a 1-cm thig, cotton, 3-4 inch long tampon up your "area" when you ride just imaging it going deeper,deeper,it scares  me to even imagine!<br>  <br>  sorry if that was to much, but i'm still 14 so i wear pads no matter what!|`|PTTUiEqHaa	well personally i usually wear pads, just because that's what ive always worn.  but im starting to try tampons now so i probably will start wearing tampons. but  definatly wear a thin pad/panti liner also!  u wouldn't want your good breeches to turn red!!!  plus... it would hurt your saddle.  lol.  hope it helps!|`|pnDZcQKpaa	i dont know why everyone is giving ittybitty_84 a low rating<br>  it's her opinion, and if she just likes pads better thats fine! although i do think that tampons are better for sports, you can't have a wrong opinion<br>  :)|`|JfBzzXQ4aa	Tampons no question.

dJs2s9pfaa	Convicts make excellent parents since both male and female play active roles in caring for their fry. They should be put alone in the 20 gallon tank unless you want them to kill off their other tankmates. Only thing is once they start breeding they don't stop! Mine breed every other month. <br>  <br>  They lay eggs and guard them continuously well until they are free swimming and large enough to venture out on their own.|`|M3pjhIecaa	Yes that would be suitable for them and yes the male is inclined to attack the female but its not always the case. I dither fish would have to be quick enough to get out of the way in that size tank or have somewhere to hide.|`|0WyFs0q0aa	they can breed in a 20 but when you are done breedind them all put the parents in the 90 gallon fish tank|`|97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Wow a 20 is too small. The recommended tank size is a 30+, and since you mentioned that you want to breed, then it means that there will be lots of fry (babies) on the way. I wouldn't go for breeding unless you have a 55 gallon minimum depending on the the amount of times you want to breed them. They will need as much space as possible to thrive and grow to their fullest potential and be very healthy. The 20 gallon tank can be used as a tank to raise fry for a while until they can be with their parents because i know some can be rough with fry(babies) so the 20 can be used as i said to raise fry till it's safe to move them with mom and dad. The more fry your convicts will have the more room the will need so keep that in mind, it might be a good idea to sell or donate some if you can't provide them with enough space. Take care, it's an amazing adventure but keep doing lots of research and you will find the results to be very rewarding if you put your mind to it.|`|H06PtiIAaa	yes teh convicts will be fine, as long as they are alone for breeding, they will breed in a 20 gallon.

I saw a program last year about an undercover investigation into illegal trade in big cat skins and body parts and it was very sad to see such beautiful animals end up as a rug or 'medicine'. unfortunately as long as there is money to be made it will continue-education and stricter laws and enforcement of these laws are probably the best we can do, which isn't really enough.<br>   A lot of the demand for skins comes from the West so that needs to be dealt with also, possibly by much higher fines or jail for anyone caught in possession of illegal animal parts. The trade in Chinese medicine is another area where education may help although it's difficult to change traditions that go so far back-even though these so called medicines don't actually work!
2CbfO4jWaa	dont mess with what works. crickets are a great food source for a young growing monitor. add mice as it gets older and thats all you ever need to feed your monitor. <br>  <br>  p.s. treats are for dogs,and wax worms are more like lizard crack then candy|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	yes, he def. can. crickets are the most nutritous for him though. you only want to use wax worms as a treat. think of them like lizard candy|`|XBBydSAMaa	As a short answer, yes you can feed your monitor wax worms.

2qgg2G8kaa	Ball pythons don't really live in the desert, but they do live in a sort of dry area. Sand is not the best choice for a ball python, maybe for a sand boa. You should use either Aspen Bedding, Cypress Mulch, or Eco earth. Those substrates work very well and they are all safe to use. <br>  <br>  Aspen bedding looks kind of like hay, yet it is easy to clean up the waste. It should be cleaned out completely every 1-3 months. Also you shouldn't mist this when your snake is shedding because it can grow mold.<br>  <br>  Cypress Mulch looks like something picked up from the forest floor, and makes the enclosure look very natural. It's also easy to clean up the waste. You don't always need to clean this out as much as you do with the Aspen Bedding, every 3-4 months would be ideal. You could also mist this whenever you need to, it will not mold unless ALWAYS wet.<br>  <br>  Eco Earth looks like a brown brick when you buy it. You soak it in water then it expands into the substrate. Holds humidity very very well. You need to mist this down but not to where its very damp and wet in the tank. This does not mold, but you should clean this out every 2-3 months. It's also easy to pick up waste. <br>  <br>  Those are some ideas for substrates. I don't recommend bark or coconut shavings. Those can harm your snake and I know you want the best for your snake. Good luck!|`|PIwP8DFxaa	yes u can but its not the best because they can choke on it|`|dDas43FZaa	Their habitat is Africa but that doesn't mean desert. They live in woodland areas.|`|brcEtJjGaa	Ball pythons ( Python regius ) are found at the edges of the forest lands of Central and Western Africa. They are equally comfortable on the ground and in trees. They are crepuscular, active around dawn and dusk.<br>  <br>  Basicall, they live in termite burrows in africa where they hide from extreme heats and where its more humid under ground.  Sand would notbe best, for now anyways. When he or she is older, you may incvorperate sand into PART ov its home. Try using reptile bark or cypres mulch. Keeps humidity in and up for them anywhere between 50 to 60 for them, and when in shed, could mist the cage to bump up humidity to 70 75.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, anything, email or ask me.|`|8i90ov0Gaa	Ball pythons ARE NOT from deserts. They are from tropical forests. Sand is bad because it doesn't allow the proper humidity levels and will cause shedding problems and possibly respiratory problems as well. Use aspen, cypress mulch, or something similar.|`|AilIV0oPaa	Umm...well. You can use it, like, no harm will come to your Ball Python. But its not the best thing to use.|`|tifJaxfEaa	The best thing is bark.<br>  The bottom of the snake's body cannot grip firmly on the sand.  It is too loose and too small for the scales on the stomach.  Also, you could have a problem with it getting under the bottom scales.<br>  <br>  These snakes to not move to be in sand.  Sidewinders are though.  Each snake's body movement help it for the ground it lives on.|`|BhXwQ2n1aa	you can but bark is the best. it holds humidity better and it won't get in his mouth as easily when feeding not to mention bark looks better|`|dXn8JaZjaa	You can put almost anything in the cage....whether it is good to use or not is another story.<br>  <br>  sand=not a good substrate.
zTeLhroWaa	You're supposed to offer him as much food as he will eat in a half hour.  If it's 5 crickets, then give him 5...but if it's 25 crickets, let him have those.  If he hasn't been putting on weight he should really see a vet.  Sounds like he could have parasites, as already suggested.<br>  <br>  And there's no such thing as an "athletic" leopard gecko.  If they're underweight it's a problem--no debate about it.  It isn't because they're really active.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	I'm not sure on that, I think the general rule is to feed as much as he will take...have you taken him to a vet since you got him? He could have internal parasites preventing him from putting on weight. I would get a fresh poo sample to the vet.|`|su5Tuo9Yaa	my friends gecko is very skinney too. if u can see his ribs its a problem. if he throws up too thats a problem. he might just be really athletic. my friends is. feed him and avarage meal once a day.|`|PSoiKZIjaa	A young leopard gecko should be fed precisely 8.5 crickets everyday.

3sB49YNnaa	Either would be fine but care fresh is probably both more absorbent and a better deodorizer.<br>  <br>  BTW - to the poster who says you can't use pine, you are wrong.  As long as they are not dusty, pine shavings are fine.  We have used them for both our guinea pigs and rabbits for over 40 years with no problems.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Sounds good :)|`|OrvTG44laa	Aspen is a poor choice for bedding.  It is made of wood, which can cause respiratory problems in most animals.  Some pet stores use this, and some people report no problems, but the dust in the wood is still harmful.  Carefresh is a good choice, but there should be no wood.  Alfalfa bedding is also good.  Get rid of the aspen bedding and just use the carefresh.|`|AA11902187	Yup! Aspen and Carefresh are the two best kinds of litter =) Perfect for any rodents.<br>  <br>  *Remember, just don't use pine or cedar.|`|6W4ZWOetaa	Those are great litters!  And yes, pine doesn't affect guinea pigs and rabbits like it does rats or mice, so that one's not too bad for guineas.|`|3cL7XphAaa	anything will work in any of the places do not worry- your rabbit will poop on what ever!
hetZz4c1aa	First of all your kitten needs to go to the vet immediately for a wellness check, her shots and a diagnoses about her eyes.  She is also old enough to be spayed, so discuss this with the vet and arrange an appointment.<br>  <br>  A reputable breeder would not have let a baby go without having the proper vaccinations, so it's important that a vet check her out as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|6RILqhzEaa	Congratulations on your new addition!<br>  <br>  First of all, you need to find a good vet and take her to the vet for a health exam. The vet will vaccinate her and help you with her eyes. At that time you can make the appointment to have her spayed because you must not breed her.<br>  <br>  By 5 months she should already have been vaccinated with her distemper combo vaccination and at least one booster shot (4 weeks apart). These vaccinations are ideally begun between 8-10 weeks old.  She also needs her rabies vaccination, which is usually given at 16 weeks. A reputable breeder would have already had her vaccinated and probably already spayed<br>  <br>  Just make sure you give her the proper vet care, a proper species specific cat diet, and keep her well groomed. Her fur can easily mat because of the length and texture and so you must brush her daily. Persians often have issues with their eyes and nasal/sinus areas due to their shortened facial structure so you must make sure to watch for infections.|`|e8f83ccff6f82416a29a6f64db62373eaa	You should take her to the vet for a check up and to have the eyes looked at. Though....since persians have larger "buggy" eyes they tend to trap more dirt and stuff in their eye and they tend to have more eye problems such as infections and watery eyes. Also because of the shape and pushed in nose they get upper respitory problems and breathing problems. Please make sure you have her vaccinated because that can help eliminate some of the respitory problems that she could get from other cats (yes even inside cats can get stuff from cats outside, esp if its a cat that likes to sit in the open window). She should get a Felv (feline Leukemia) vaccination twice-3 to 4 weeks apart as a kitten then yearly thereafter, and a FVRCP (Distemper-upper respatory) at the same time. <br>  Persians are very high matanance cats. You should be prepaired to brush her weekly or twice a week if needed. if not she could develope knots in her hair and then she would have to be shaved. If you keep up on the brushings you will be ok. Also since they have such long hair they tend to get hairballs a lot. I recomend feeding her a food that is for hairball control, and also give her a hairball remedy one weekly, and more often if she has a hairball. Even doing those she may still hack up a hairball or two on occasion, but doing the above (along with the brushing) will minimize the hairball hacking.|`|vxyHnqc5aa	The eye problem is perfectly normal in persian cats.  Because of they  squashed faces they tend to suffer with blocked tear ducts.  This will cause the eyes to leak, the liquid is also a brown/red colour when wet and dries to a dark black/brown colour. Just wash the eyes every day with a soft wet cloth or cotton wool.  There is no treatment for this and your vet will tell you the same. <br>  <br>   I don't know what shots you have in the US but here in the UK we vaccinate at 9 weeks, then again at 12 weeks for cat flu, enteritis and leukemia.  <br>  <br>  A persian will also matt up very easily as the fur is very fine, she will need to be brushed twice a day.  If she does get badly matted you can very carefully cut the matts out or your vet can shave them under anesthetic. Don't be afraid to take them to the vets if they get badly matted as this is quite a common problem with persians, especially if they are an outdoor cat like mine.<br>  <br>  Also, persians can be known for having a nasty temper, however this is more common in indoor persians.  Mine has always been an outdoor cat and he is the most loving and laid back cat I have ever known, he follows me like a dog and has even been away camping with me, he wanders off around the campsite then comes back to my tent.  They really can be wonderful cats to have.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you x|`|nQdGGBN4aa	Persians, because of the shape of their faces, can have more eye problems than other breeds.<br>  <br>  You need to take her to a vet to have the problem looked at.<br>  <br>  Found this at <a href="http://www.best-cat-art.com/cat-eye-health.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.best-cat-art.com/cat-eye-heal...</a><br>  --------------------------<br>   Persian cat eye problems.<br>  <br>  Persians, because of the unique shape of their faces, often experience cat eye health problems. Their eyes need to be checked regularly because Persian cats have difficulty keeping them cleaned. A particular problem is watering eyes. Their faces may need regularly wiping with a damp cloth to prevent tear staining. <br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  I also found other references which indicate that Persians can have more eye problems.<br>  <br>  One disease that is mentioned is glaucoma - increased pressure inside the eye.<br>  <br>  One of our cats, Felix - he's not a Persian, however - developed glaucoma in his left eye. Before it was diagnosed it had damaged the eye and the eye had to be removed. Felix is diabetic and this might have contributed to the glaucoma but it is not certain.<br>  <br>  Best thing is for the vet to decide if the watering is normal for your Persian or if it is an infection.<br>  <br>  As for shots, that is, vaccinations, the vet is the best person to talk to about them.<br>  <br>  Also - have her spayed when she is old enough - 4 months old or so.|`|kZrZCPRMaa	Well you need to atleast call up the vet and ask them questions about the shots?
u7vrul2Faa	Vaccinations are usually given at around 8-9 weeks of age if they are kittens, if an adult cat ASAP. <br>   <br>  Cats are usually vaccinated against,<br>   <br>  *feline panleucopenia (infectious enteritis)<br>   <br>  *feline herpsevirus<br>   <br>  *feline chlamydia<br>   <br>  *feline calicivirus<br>   <br>  *feline leukaemia virus (feLV)<br>   <br>  *feline viral rhinotracheitis<br>   <br>  Your cat depending on where you are may not require all of the above and some of these vaccinations need to be repeated as a course and some require a repeat every year. <br>   <br>  Your vet will advise you and give you a vaccination sheet.<br>   <br>  As for the best cats, non-pedigree shelter cats are rewarding to own and come in a variety of colours and characters.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Feline Rhinotrachetitis, Calici, Panleukopenia (commonly known as the "3 in 1" shot).<br>  <br>  Lots of breeders do not recommend you get the FELV shot nor the Chlamydia one as there are problems with giving those shots.  Been too many cases of tumors on the sites of those vaccines.<br>  <br>  Usually kittens get them at ages 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks.  Rabies vaccine at 4 months.<br>  <br>  Its now been recommend you only get shots every other year unless this is an outside cat with more contact with other cats.|`|6RILqhzEaa	The main vaccinations for a kitty are FVRCP (Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis, Calici, Panleukopenia) and rabies. <br>  <br>  The FVRCP sometimes goes by other names like PPC or whatever. Just ask the vet about the panleukopenia/distemper combo vaccination. This vaccination should be given at 8-10 weeks of age, then a booster is needed 4 weeks later. Some vets will want to give another booster, but it's not really necessary. If the cat is older than 8-10 weeks, it will still need the same vaccination and booster shot.<br>  <br>  The rabies shot can be given at 16 weeks of age. All cats over 16 weeks need a rabies shot. Rabies is given every year or every 3 years, depending on the type of vaccine used. I recommend PureVax by Mariel.<br>  <br>  The cost depends. You need to call the vets in your area and ask how much they charge. Most will also require an exam prior to vaccinations. You may be able to find a low cost spay/neuter clinic in your area that also does low cost vaccinations. You can also call the local shelter to see if they offer low cost rabies vax.<br>  <br>  The only other vaccines you may want to consider are for Leukemia (FeLV) and Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) if your kitty goes outside and is at risk of exposure to cats with these diseases. <br>  <br>  Make sure you get your kitty dewormed, and always use a flea treatment like Revolution or Advantage. Stay away from over the counter flea preventatives because they often make cats sick.<br>  <br>  Last but not least, get your kitty spayed or neutered.|`|AA10075527	The vet will give it a vaccine when you first take it, then the next month you have to go again so that he can give her another vaccine, and then every 6 months a vaccine is required.

95189342d06d1e6a137e42b2b1138bd3aa	The crickets shouldn't be any longer than your gecko's head is wide.  If they're longer than that, obviously it's harder for the gecko to get them in one bite and the crickets could injure your gecko.  Watch your gecko and if she seems to be ok with eating them, then you'll probably be fine this time.  Ask your pet store what day they get their crickets delivered so that you get buy them when they are fresh and smaller.  If they're grown crickets and near an inch or longer, you probably shouldn't feed them to it.|`|4hFT5JcLaa	No, it's not okay. If the cricket is bigger than her head, don't give them to her. As a general rule of thumb, you want to feed her something of a size that will fit the area between her eyes. Crickets that are too big could actually munch on your gecko instead of the other way around! :(|`|b4f40baa5df8df7f73a5acb8d9883715aa	No!!!! That's not okay.  Tiny lizards need small crickets.

And if you sell him well there goes your luxury ride and your stuck with two horses that need your attention everyday 365 days a year that have more of a potential to hurt you or others. <br>  <br>  I would stop and think about what your really want in life for companions. Are you looking for a horse that's better suited for you or are you looking for a change because well honestly your bored and you want new and exciting? Maybe you should just look into another type of disicpline and make your relationships and rides enjoyable for all three of you.|`|5kUxkun3aa	will you have enough time to spend on 2 youngsters?<br>  sometimes having a good horse helps bring on a younger one.<br>  at the end of the day it is your choice. personally i would stick with what you have got and buy another when you sell next year.|`|Oiabe82gaa	You can only have 2 horses because of budget...you need to have time for them both. <br>  Your TB will only be worth more next year if you have worked and schooled him properly this year!<br>  After a years lease, in the wrong hands that QH could be ruined, then you still won't have an all round kid friendly horse!<br>  If you get a 2 yr old this year work it and sell it next year you'll have started that baby WAY to early, so DON"T BE GREEDY and be satisfiedwith what you have!!!|`|x787hJbBaa	Yeah, it does. You get to keep your horse, and someone gets to feel the love and happiness having a horse gives you. Also, if you can train another horse it will give you good experience. Lease out your horse. If he has a good personality and isn't a difficult ride, then a beginner could ride him. Also, if you wanted to, and provided you ride at a barn with lessons, let the kids ride him during the lessons in exchange for board, etc. because that way he gets exercised and the board for him gets paid.|`|Fq94ZXhOaa	If you're close to your QH, you might want to just lease him for now and see how you get on financially. If it doesn't work out you can always sell him on but at least you would have tried all your options. Good luck with your TB and maybe future QH! :)|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	yes lease a horse out! it lets you still fully own your horse, but it gives other people a chance to get the feeling of ownership. in the end its a win/win!|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I think it could work, but I think you should just wait the year.  Do jumpers on your QH this year, while training the 3 year old to sell.  Next year, sell the 3 year old and buy a new 2 year old to train.
M3pjhIecaa	Measure front to back times by length this will give you the surface area, as a guide its 12sq inch of surface area per inch of fish, its a guide so for fish like neons you need 6sq inch only. <br>  Neon's are fine I wouldn't classify them as intermediate if you wanted to breed them then its not for a beginner but to keep they are fairly undemanding <br>  Plants I'd go for giant vallisneria, annubias nana(attached to wood/rock) polysperma and java moss. Giant valls will send of runners and you will probably take a year or so to spread it arount the back and sides cut the tops off with scissors when its over growing, polysperma you will need to prune every few weeks, anubias is very slow growing, java moss you just let run riot and pull away where you dont want it to go. <br>  I'm guessing as i don't know the dimensions of the tank but what you've stated doesn't seem overly demanding for the size you're talking about.|`|YVS53aksaa	a good way to see it is a fish per gallon. but thats the MOST you could do. i have no idea though if they would get along. good luck!|`|SOxdyWQOaa	guppies good starter fish <br>  java ferns will work<br>  the black phantom fish<br>  <br>  <br>  18 years experience with fish|`|7KxQXHzOaa	it would be about 56 gallons total<br>  <br>  my sister is a beginner w/ fish and has some neon tetras they're very easy to take care of, platys are also good beginners<br>  <br>  i am not a plant person so i don't know

8NSh1D4Maa	Yes.  Rabbits are prey animals, and constantly alert.  They sleep lightly and in short periods.  Many owners will never see their rabbits with closed eyes because of this.|`|dhlSrrMwaa	It's totally normal. Very rarely do you see them actually go into a deep sleep. They are hard wired to be constantly alert & ready to take off. They are prey so they are always on alert for the predator to arrive.|`|BLMn4owEaa	First you need to specify for me how you got the rabbit (pet store, friend ,wild ext.) and Second its size and colors, that way i can try and identify the breed. Their are some breeds of rabbits that are nocturnal so it may be unaccustomed to the amount of light in its enclosure and thus feel exhausted but uncomfortable during the day and energized but unable to travel at night. On the opposite side it may just be sleeping when you are. The most important thing is rabbits are pray to hundreds of things in the wild so they always "sleep with one eye open" and you schould never see it laying on its side snoring|`|YPSSVxwKaa	my rabbit does the same thing they do get sleep but for rabbits they don't need as much sleep as you do so that's why it looks like they don't get any sleep!!

Most of them are only suitable for use as a litter box. You can save money and have a much bigger cage if you build one. <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com</a> is a great site on how to build on and what you need. Their designs are for guinea pigs, but can be adapted for rabbits. The minimum size for a rabbit would be 2*3*2 grids. You can go a google search for NIC rabbit cage or C&C cage. Rabbits should be housed indoors.<br>  <br>  Diet: Rabbits need a good diet to stay healthy. A good quality pellet is a must as well as unlimited timothy hay and veggies when they get older. Oxbow makes a good pellet, but there are other good pellets too. Look for a timothy based pellet without corn. Water should be given in a bowl if you can, but a large water bottle can work too. <br>  <br>  Toys: Rabbits need toys to play with. There are some good ones at pet stores, but not all rabbits will like these. Paper bags, paper towel rolls, grass mats (not treated), phone books and many other things can be used for rabbits. <br>  <br>  Exercise: Rabbits need to get out of the cage for some exercise. You need to provide a rabbit safe room for them to runs around. You can set up a run outside, but it needs to be secure so the rabbit cannot get out and other animals cannot get it. A rabbit should never be left outside unsupervised. <br>  <br>  Vet care: Rabbits should see a vet on a regular basis for a check up. They should also be spayed or neutered.|`|I38WF5aFaa	Go to the library or bookstore and borrow or buy one of these books.<br>  Raising Rabbits the Modern Way by Bob Bennett<br>  Storey's Guide to Raising Rabbits by Bob Bennett<br>  <br>  They are the same book.

OLXv3DEAaa	12 weeks is the best, if you really have to you can maybe give them away at 10 weeks.<br>  <br>  A lot of people give their kittens away younger than that but its reallllly not a good idea. Kittens that small haven't learned all their grooming and social skills from mom and the rest of the litter. So they're more likely to go outside the litter box, misbehave etc. I'd wait till 12 weeks|`|FpMGM0TRaa	Talk to the vet, but I recommend 7-9 weeks.  My kitty was 7 weeks when we got him.  Be sure to socialize and cuddle the new kittens!|`|tatbIu54aa	At least 8-9 weeks.<br>  But I would say at 3 months.<br>  If kittens get taken away from their moms too soon they will not grow up properly and will be unhappy.<br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Between 8 and 12 weeks.|`|zo4gb6qzaa	i'd say maybe...... 3 to 4 months or later they'll be fine to give away|`|5A24XhTfaa	I'd recommend 3 months old thats when i got my kitten and they need to learn how to clean themselves and skills from thier mommy kitty HOPE I HELPED|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Keep the kittens for 10-12 weeks old for them to be mentally and physically ready to leave.

iasOicRjaa	Is he neutered??<br>  <br>  He may be coming into age and an uneutered male will naturally start to display dominance behavior...usually they start with the "easy targets" and work their way up. I would start by neutering him....|`|MKuDawP7aa	The longer you have allowed this bad dog behavior to continue, the more entrenched your dog becomes in his bullying act. So you must take the situation in hand and educate your pooch before it's too late. Tucker is in for some serious dog behavior modification.<br>  <br>  What we need to do is teach Tucker that chasing cars and bicycles is not fine, and that it carries consequences. The trick is to have Tucker realize that the sky comes falling down on him the moment he misbehaves, in a manner of speaking.<br>  <br>  The experiment must take place at home for my dog training tips to work. At the scene of the crime, in other words. This is bound to take a few days, four or five at the most, to ensure my plan still works even when you are not around to supervise him. In order to achieve that, we'll spy on him. But let me warn you, unless you are consistent, this will be an exercise in futility.<br>  <br>  Dog Training Behavior Modification: Action!<br>  <br>  Here is where we get into some serious dog training behavior modification mode. First, tie a 35-foot clothesline rope to Tucker's slip-chain training collar and let him roam around the backyard while you are keeping busy. Just make sure you keep an eye on him at all times so he does not get himself into trouble with that rope. When you think he has forgotten about it, move to your front yard.<br>  <br>  Now it is vital that you keep a sharp eye on him, because the second he starts his barking charge, you need to pull on the rope with all your might. Keep pulling till he's at your feet, and then give him an abrupt shaking accompanied by a sharp tongue lashing in a loud, angry voice. The idea is to shock him in many ways to ensure he really gets the message. Only then will you really achieve lasting results.<br>  <br>  Three important points to keep in mind here:<br>  <br>  * react quickly;<br>  <br>  * don't appear to lose control of yourself; and<br>  <br>  * don't expose him to temptation.<br>  <br>  It is crucial that until this experiment is over, you do not give Tucker the slightest chance of repeating his bad behavior without being corrected immediately. If you allow that to happen, you'll have to start all over again because, in Tucker's mind, that behavior is allowed some of the time.<br>  <br>  When you develop a plan for dog training, the important thing to remember is that you must stick to it no matter what. You slip once, you can be sure that Tucker will notice, and he won't forget.|`|KMeUXNq3aa	I wish my dog was that entertaining. Do you wanna trade. My dog is a lazy bum.

Sometimes you have to let the animal or in this case the mamma smell what the kitten was laying on to pick up the kittens scent and the mamma will know the kitten is dead. Animals are capable of mourning. I didn't believe it myself...but, I will tell you a example..if you dont mind.<br>  <br>  We had adopted a senior dog from our local humane society and not to long before that my mom adopted a cat from the same place. The two animals would share the same space, my dog got along with cats so well.. I'd never seen anything like it.<br>  <br>  It came time to put our dog down, and I didn't think of the cats.. I was sad about my dog but he was loved and spoiled in the last year of his life.<br>  <br>  Well, for the longest time our cat from the humane society would lay in ALL the same spots the dog did..and he had never done this even when my dog was alive. It struck me weird, and it continued for a while and I did some research on it.<br>  <br>  And I was surprised as to why our cat was doing this.. it's a form of mourning. Don't ever underestimate animals they are more capable of what we give them credit for.<br>  <br>  In any case our cat eventually did stop laying in all the dog's old spots, I guess it's just a matter of how much scent they absorb until they are comfortable.<br>  <br>  I'm not a breeder but I wanted to help. So, if you have one item that the dead kitten was on when it died let the mamma smell it..leave it out for a while and I'll bet you'll see after a while a difference in your cat.|`|7i8ZKUQZaa	She will be fine shes a good mother as long as she does keep taking care of the ones she has now it will be fine its normal she lost her baby its her way of grieving for her baby but in time she will forget about her baby what did you do with the dead kitten?? jw sorry for the lose and good luck

Don't be afraid to explore other types of animals as pets, you might find that you love all kinds of animals. And, in reflection of what other responders are suggesting, you might feel even better if you rescue an animal from a shelter. If you liked having a hamster, you might like gerbils, rats, mice, and guinea pigs, too. It might also be a good idea to get a pair.|`|zrSroauJaa	Yes I would. My Chinese dwarf hamster just died and  few days ago we got another one.  You should give yourself as much time as you need. But I really think that you should get another one. No pet could possibly replace your hamster but you will love them just as much in a different way. Best of luck!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Yes I would get another one. You will feel better and rescue another one from the pet store. Make sure you clean the old cage out real good before putting a new one in there, in case the old one had a disease.|`|aCrILRS9aa	i think you should get a new hamster and even though i dont know Gary he will be missed R.I.P. Gary =(|`|5s4IV7RAaa	oh sweetheart bless you. You sound like you looked after Gary really well and gave him lots of love and attention. Its sad when an animal dies but there is usually a good reason for it. Maybe Gary was old. i know you only had him for 4 months but he may have been older than that. only you can decide if you get another one. all i will say is that imagine all the love and attention you gave to Gary and then think how much more you have left over to give to a new little friend. Hamsters don't usually live longer than 2 years so maybe a rabbit or guinea pig could be a different choice for you. I know you are sad at the moment but you will feel better i promise|`|Fek6fGC8aa	So So So sorry. I don't think that he died from the dog treat because those are actually good for them. I definitely think that you should get another hamster. Make sure you wait a while until you are ready for another pet. You could also have a funeral for Gary. Best of luck and it sounds like he had a happy life even though it was short. I recommend that if you get another one to not put it in the same cage or even the same room because most likely he had a disease because they are very common in hamsters.|`|VeiCR9Kwaa	I wouldn't make any decision right away. Believe it or not, you are grieving for Gary. And grief is grief, whether it's for a pet or a loved one. That's the way we humans are. After all, we give our pets names, so we think of them in very human-like terms. They are our friends and members of our family.<br>  <br>  You need time to grieve for Gary, and Gary DESERVES a time for you to honor his memory. If you ran out and bought another hamster right away, how do you think Gary would feel about that? Wait awhile, remember and cherish the time you spent with Gary and go through the entire grief process. Then, when you feel the time is right, you can decide if you want a new hamster.

Rw7gi86Naa	If the kitten stays with its Mom long enough, (an absolute minimum of ten weeks and preferably twelve) it should be very simple. Kittens taken from their mothers too soon often develop nursing behavior on themselves, other cats, humans, or fabric, and these habits will often continue throughout adulthood. They also need this time to learn proper cat behavior from their mother cat, including use of the litter box, socializing with humans and other cats. So, usually when a kitten has been observing their mother using the litter box, they will usually copy her which also helps the other kittens learn. <br>  <br>  After the kitten has left his mother and he comes home with you for the first time, feed him wet food, (which is what‘s best for him especially before he’s a year old). About thirty minutes after he‘s done eating, place him in the box. If putting him in the box doesn‘t prompt him to use it, then stir the litter with your hands while he’s watching. Never restrain him in the box; you should always let the kitten jump out if he wants to. <br>  <br>  Kittens will often have accidents, and the best thing to do is to pick up the feces and put it in the litter box. This will help him understand that the litter box belongs to him and that is where he should go. If you catch him sniffing around or looking like he needs to go, then immediately put him in the box.  Also one of the most important tips to prevent him from going in the same spot is to thoroughly clean it. I added stain and odor removing tips below. Never yell at or scold the kitten for accidents, as you wouldn't scold a potty training toddler for an accident. Punishment does not help a cat‘s behavior. All it does is make your cat fear and resent you. <br>  <br>  Each day about a half an hour after mealtime and playtime, put him in the box as you did the first time. Cats are creatures of habit, so teach them the routine and you should have no problem. You could also try closing off the kittens in a room with a litter box, that way it will be right there for them.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Cg5FJVd9aa	there little kittens have patientce they need to adapt to doing there buisness in one spot<br>  <br>  hopee i helpedd!!<br>  <br>  --kaylynn<br>  (bestt answerr pleasee??)|`|AA10063288	If your cat and kittens are also outside cats, then I would suggest tossing a little loose dirt in the litter. Chances are mama cat taught the youngsters how to pee in the dirt and they are confused now. This was true for a feral kitten I brought home. He needed dirt mixed with his litter for about 2 days. If they have been raised strictly indoors, then I agree with Lisa's suggestions above.|`|kZrZCPRMaa	Well there young so it might take some time <br>  theres also this spray you could buy for the ltter box that <br>  way they'll actually use it(:<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|iwvMGULeaa	A lot of times when cats feel uncomfortable in their environment, they will tend not to "go" where you designate them to go. That is completely normal, yet very inconvenient. There are a couple steps you can take.<br>  <br>  If the kittens are pooping outside of their litter box, a helpful step you can take is to move the stool from wherever they pooped before, and moving it into their litter box. This will give the litter box the scent of their own excrement, and it will draw the attentions of the kittens to go there again to do their business.<br>  <br>  If this still doesn't work, try locking the kittens in a small area, such as a bathroom. Put the litter box inside the small area along with the kittens. This gives the kittens a limited amount of area for which they can use to do their business, and they will most likely be directed to use their litter box, given the convenience of the area.<br>  <br>  Now, if either of these methods do not work, there are a couple of products you can purchase that may do the trick for you. Either a "No Go" spray or a Comfort Zone hormone releaser may work. The No Go spray is something you apply to the area where you don't want your kittens to go, and the hormone releaser releases hormones that will calm the kittens down enough so that they wont be too nervous to go where they are supposed to.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps! Email me if you have questions.

Your puppy is going to need all kinds of vet care during her first year-check ups, shots and spaying.  That will be several hundred, minimum.  <br>  <br>  Also, I am appalled that a BREEDER recommended you do your own shots.  You should not have been allowed to even purchase this puppy if you can't pay for it over the next fifteen of so years!  Obviously, this breeder is only in it for the money.<br>  <br>  Why don't you give your puppy to a good home now, before she is a year old, has heartworm, is pregnant, and not housebroken?

Red Ramshorns are not really seen in traditional petstores but I usually get them online in groups for $5-$20 depending on how many are in each group. Pondsnails are free and usually come clinging to live plants and are the pesky type snails.  Asolene Spixi's(not in traditional petstores) also are kind of pricey due to their beauty.<br>  <br>  2.

Snails do not die easily unless you provide them with no sinking foods and your tank always prestine clean. <br>  <br>  4. Yes. Snails can live with goldfish. I have 10 Ivory Mystery Snails with my Goldfish and they don't even bother the snails.  The only thing I see with the two being together is that the goldfish are sooo greedy <br>  snails never get any of the goldfish food so at night when the goldfish are napping I just toss in some sinking shrimp pellets and I assume the snails get alteast some of them...if not they must be getting food particles that are down in the gravel.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	snails are so cheap, there are a lot of types<br>  apple snail<br>  gold snails<br>  Japanese live<br>  ramshorn<br>  and also mystery snails!<br>  I would recommend apple snails<br>  good luck|`|a063525afac8cd769f0358cd6b18ff02aa	I personally hate snails they caused my tank so many problems the rate they breed at and everything and they're just about impossible to eliminate.

Fancy goldfish grow to 6-8+ inches. Those goldfish she's keeping in a bowl won't grow big while they're in a bowl because by keeping them in a bowl she's stunting their growth and killing them. The reason uneducated people like you think that goldfish are small and short-lived fish is because they see people keeping them in bowls, and they talk to the people keeping them in bowls, and the people tell them that they stay small and they don't live very long. Well, all of this is completely untrue. Goldfish grow huge, and they can live for 25+ years.

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	None.  Cats require a nutrient called Taurine to be supplemented into their diets.  Without this nutrient, the cat will go blind and have liver problems.  Taurine is included in the ingredients of most every cat food on the market.  Since dogs are able to produce taurine naturally within their own body system (cats can't), dog food does not contain it (a few do have it but in insufficient amounts to fill a cat's dietary requirements).  Human food contains alot of fats cats don't need.  The seasonings we use in cooking can upset a cat's tummy.  Some human foods are even toxic to cats and can cause permanent organ damage, a deadly type of anemia, or even death if consumed.  Human food also doesn't supply taurine for the cat.

IMPvzBk1aa	First, insulin resistance and Cushings may be present in the same horse, and this condition also leaves a horse more prone to laminitis and founder.  I'm guessing the horse was already insulin resistant before the laminitis began manifesting.<br>  <br>  The long, hard to shed coat is usually associated with thyroid insufficiency, which is rare in horses unless it is caused by the pituitary changes associated with Cushings.  Testing for Cushings has to be performed at the right time of year, since changes in length of daylight affect hormone levels and test results, so I would have the horse re-tested for Cushings if the coat isn't shedding.<br>  <br>  There is medical treatment available for Cushings, and management of insulin resistance is mostly a matter of regulating diet.  If you can't get acceptable forage, there are commercial feeds formulated for laminitic/insulin resistant horses.  Purina Wellsolve is one.  My Cushings gelding is on Purina equine senior, and my easy keeper insulin resistant mare is on Wellsolve.  Both get good grass hay, and the mare wears a grazing muzzle to be out on pasture.  The gelding gets Evitex and no other medication, and it has been several years since he was dignosed with no advancement of his symptoms.<br>  <br>  If your mare is suffering this much, do you have the services of a good farrier or trimmer to help her?  Have her hooves been xrayed to determine the degree of coffin bone displacement?  That would be the first thing to determine for her.  Managing all of this requires cooperation between you, your vet, and your trimmer/farrier.  And you have to have control over the horse's diet and rigidly adhere to it. I would start by having your vet get films of the hoof, and re-evaluate her for Cushings, and go from there.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Why do they have to be a symptom of something? Why can't she just be insulin resistant and prone to founder?<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT -- Oh, okay. Well I just don't understand why you think there's something else wrong with her when she doesn't have any other symptoms.<br>  <br>  You can put pads on her feet to help with the founder. And you should have her on low carb feed.|`|034f5753f9ad6567e841eda4b3bd8210aa	Galloppal pretty well covered it all.  You really should try to have the test for cushings done again.  A horse that is borderline will show up as negative at one point in the year and positive in the other.  The length of daylight really does make a difference.<br>    <br>     You didn't say what your deworming program is like though.  Sometimes a horse that is not on a regular deworming schedule will have a longer coat than other horses around.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	founder is an iffy one, it could be many things, but it could be related to her insulin resistence. They also get hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels) from the richer hay and grain, and their body can't store it because of the insulin resistance, and therefore the horse founders. <br>     A long, hard to shed coat could come from her being older- we have a pony (no cushings) that keeps her coat year round- we have to shave her in the summer because she won't shed anymore. <br>  <br>  How are you treating her insulin resistence? Usually it occurs because of a high carb or sugar diet, or obesity. She should be on insulin shots, as well as diet change and hopefully exercise to help decrease the resistence. <br>     Talk to your vet (or search around) about getting her on a  lower carb diet, with increased fat levels. You also want to spread the feedings around- many meals instead of 2-3 large meals a day will keep her blood glucose levels down, and therefore lessen the strain on insulin. There are some pelleted products, a complete feed, that you can feed instead of hay if you can't find the correct stuff, or to decrease the amount of rich hay you feed. <br>  <br>  ***All diet changes, while necessary for decreasing the insulin resistence, should be talked over with your vet, as well as careful monitoring of her blood glucose and insulin levels***<br>  <br>  Here are some links:<br>  <a href="http://www.equinemedsurg.com/faqir.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.equinemedsurg.com/faqir.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.auburnlabs.com/insulinResistance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.auburnlabs.com/insulinResista...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: You could compare it to your horse having Type 2 diabetes- it is basically the same thing.|`|oQmL4IdWaa	It is really hard to say what you should do without seeing your horse.  IT depends on how much pain she is in and how much damage their is to her feet.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to get her to a good vet experienced in founder, and get a good farrier also experienced in founder to work with the vet on her feet.<br>  <br>  As for feeding, there are a lot of low carb products on the market right now for insulin resistant horses, some are even complete feeds (no hay necessary) Im not sure where you live, and most feed products are somewhat regional but check what brands are available in your area and check what your vet recommends.<br>  <br>  Hay can actually be tested for carbohydrates, and even grass hay can be quite high.  It depends on when it was cut, and what type of grass it is.<br>  <br>  www.safergrass.org is a great resource for insulin resistant/founder prone horses.<br>  <br>  Good Luck...
v4vyq9Thaa	I found the best thing to do is to use a heating pad with a heat lamp above it for the day time. Then at night I turn off the light but leave the heating pad on. It works well and they can get heat on their stomachs all day long.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|zTeLhroWaa	Bottom line is Leos need to have heat on their bellies.  That's how they digest food.  They can't absorb heat through their backs.<br>  <br>  That being said, sometimes it's difficult to maintain tank temps with a heat pad alone. <br>  <br>  In one of my vivs I have a heat pad AND a 24hour infrared heat lamp.  Infrared or nocturnal is the best to use because they can't sense the light and it does not hurt their eyes.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend using the lamps alone because the gecko may not be able to absorb the right amount of heat from them.<br>  <br>  Cool side should be between 75 and 78 degrees and the warm side should be between 85 and 88 degrees.
zqVDJxUIaa	First of all, a filter with no cartridge is useless. It will do nothing except give a little oxygen. Unplugging it would be better, as you will save electricity and have a spare one up and running if your old one breaks down. Also, not using the useless filter (the one without a cartridge) will reduce noise in your aquarium, which can be annoying.The 70-90 one would be fine, as long as you make sure that it doesn't produce too much current in your tank, because goldfish don't like currents. The underwater filter would not be necessary. However, it wouldn't hurt, especially if your tank is overstocked. More than one filter is always good, because when you change the filter media, the aquarium won't lose all of its beneficial bacteria. <br>  <br>  Good Luck, and happy fish keeping!|`|9mlY5cB1aa	You only need the 70-90 and the 24-36, but even then, make sure you don't overstock. You must have a filter, and a filter cartridge, and an aerator isn't necessary but it would help immensely.|`|zzaN4wG3aa	You can't go wrong over filtering your aquarium.  Go for it.  <br>  <br>  The air pump is really optional.  In a 55G with at least one hang on the back filter, your water will be well oxygenated.|`|wu65ibG6aa	yes you can use those filters and various combinations of filters. no you can never over oxygenate your tank the water will only absorb so much and no you can never have too much filtration..never...  keep in mind you dont want to have too little or just enough filtration you always want more, it will only increase water quality .. and also having multiple filters is an advantage for when you have to replace the cartridges or carbon, alternate doing one then the other a few weeks apart. this will help keep the live bacteria sustained in your tank that your fish need to stay healthy

You will also get fined if he doesn't have registration, depending on your city.  If he goes to a shelter, you'll more than likely have to pay an impound fee for shelter, food and water they provided. <br>  <br>  Walk around the area you lost him. Call his name.

Once comfotable and ready the female will have her babies. they will look like small hamsters, but will have hair. Don't mess with the babies for awhile because their mother must asscoiate herself with them.

DLxh9CANaa	People get judgemental about older horses because they make assumptions about them and about the people who own them, most of which are FALSE. My sister plays polo as a hobby, and her oldest horse is 26 and still going strong- she plans to use him as an umpire's horse this year, in fact. Her next oldest horse just turned 19 in January, and he's the best horse she's got. She has one mare, who's now 17, that she's still working with as well. All this goes to show that even older horses can still play or work as hard as or harder than their younger peers- it's just a question of how they are cared for and of the individual horse's ability to resist age related changes that determine how long they last, not some arbitrary human rule. Horses don't think or behave as people do, and for them, aging is a process that happens constantly. <br>  <br>  I also disagree with the statements most of the people here have made about how older horses tend to develop health problems. That's just NONSENSE, at least from my perspective, because NONE of OUR horses are ill or lame, and they are all in their teens and twenties, with the exception of one or two. It's a mistake to ASSUME that ALL horses will get sick or hurt as they get older, just as it's wrong to ASSUME this idea is true of people. Like humans, horses age at different rates and in different ways- and no two are alike. I'm in my mid 40's, and I have grandparents who are still alive and in their 80's and 90's, and they are in relatively good health- nobody's bed ridden, nobody has Alzheimer's, and no one uses a wheelchair- and yet they are quite advanced in their ages. It's all a matter of DEGREE, is what I think. Some horses can be in their 30's and still act like they are 3- I've known a couple of these. Our old horse is one of them- there are times when he STILL acts like a 2 year old, especially when it's really cold out or he really starts feeling good. I've also known other horses who were in their prime, and yet they ACTED as though they had one hoof already in the grave. It's just how they were- it didn't mean anything was wrong. <br>  <br>  Just my thinking on this....|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	It's the same as with humans. A 65 year old man may be in great health, but because of his age, he's not as flexible and limber as he used to be, his joints ache and hurt more with exercise. Not sure how old you are, but when you start 'feeling your age' you'll know what they mean when they say that. And, I'm not saying it excuses all behaviors, but there is something about age that brings a few aches with it.|`|njz5XFG2aa	Most of it has to do with the care they have had all there life some horses don't get the best care they could have.The ones that are 18 and older have probably had the best care all there lives.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	As horses (or any animal) gets older, they get health problems, especially if they are ridden less. If you get a hardy horse that is ridden regularly, they can last, problem free, a lot longer than a horse that is only ridden occasionally, or is not as hardy.<br>  <br>  Arabians are one of the breeds that do very well old- I know quite a few that compete into their 30s without slowing down, or even showing their age. Most pony breeds are another example. <br>      However, most horse breeds are not like that, and get older sooner, especially without regular exercise.<br>  <br>  As for soundness problems- as you (or a horse) ages, your bones get less dense, and cartiage begins to ossify- you get arthritis, better chances to get bone spurs or break something, etc. Once again- regular riding and a hardy horse can put this off longer than other horses, but it will eventually catch up.<br>  <br>  Muscle problems- muscles are less flexible as you age, and an older horse is more likely to pull something, once again, if not ridden regularly.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	My horse finally retired from being a lesson horse this August... and he's over 40 years old :)  Granted, for the past year or so he's only been doing walk-trot lessons, but he still has spunk :)  He's been sound and healthy up until last month... he fell out in the pasture and has been lame and having difficulties recovering :(  Gradually getting better, though.  He's an amazing pony :)  He is nearly toothless but he's in good weight as he gets proper food.<br>  His best friend, a TB gelding who passed away a year ago at age 36, won the year-end state hunter/jumper association childrens 2'6" hunter at the age of 28, and continued to give lessons up until a year or two before he died also.<br>  <br>  I, too, am used to horses still being ridden and competing through 25 and up, and I've always been in barns that way, so I have a hard time thinking of an 18 y/o horse as old, too.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	Sadly folks still think of horse age like a dog's age 7 to one human year.<br>  <br>  Actually it's more like 3.3 to one human.  18 is middle age.  Heck with the care they get nowadays, it's more like 3 to 1 'cause they are living a LOT longer.<br>  <br>  Heck I got dumped 5 times the SAME day back in '75 off a 25 yr old AQHA ROM gelding named Bob Martin!  I had a 27 yr old mare who went on an 8 hour trail ride while I was sitting on a 6 yr old mare I'd been riding ALL summer.  Guess who was ready to go do it again the NEXT day???<br>  <br>  Back in 1968 I was told by one of the ranch hands where I boarded that if he caught me on a horse over 18 he'd make me get off and carry it.  At the time, my old mare was 22!!  ROFLOL|`|RUxRNsf4aa	I do understand where you're coming from, but as someone once told me, "Don't judge why people do what they do until you have walked a mile in their shoes. It is not until then that you can understand why they are the way they are"<br>   Maybe their horse is so old that they don't want to risk an easily possible injury, pain for the horse that gave them so much? Maybe it has done so much, all its life worked its heart out being ridden, that they feel it deserves a rest and retirement?|`|zMXDolD9aa	I suppose people are more judgemental because as the horse gets older they tend to slow down a bit, at some point. For some horses, it takes years and many people will just jump at the chance to blame whatever fault the horse may have on its age, whether that has a play in it or not. I suppose it's just stereotypes really.<br>  I used to a ride a 15 year old cob, you would never have known. My friend owns a 20-something year old OTTB, and she acts like she raced yesterday. <br>  Horses should be retired if they're bored of working and deserve a break, many people believe that if a horse has had a long active life (such as those as riding school horses have), then they should get an easier time later on and can spend the rest of their life in relaxed retirement. It doesn't hurt them if they're retired early and many find it pleasant, but horses shouldn't be retired SOLELY on their age if they're still raring to go. It all depends on the horse and their preferred lifestyle.|`|7CIg9Gmraa	I know i am not answering your question But i TOTALLY AGREE!!!!!<br>  I have a 27 year old horse who i high school rodeo on and i usually place in  the top 5!!! well hope you can find an answer cuz i sure want one!!!!|`|6odO4PK0aa	My Horses is 17 , she is completely sound, ( More so then my coach's 9 year old , who is Lame Often) My Horse still competes , Jumps 3'3ft and Wins often.

Though I know a horse in his thirties that is still doing jumping.  And yes, people shouldn't suddenly think just because the horse is old he has health issues.  As I said before, they are more prone to heath problems and that's why people stray away from them.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Well... the fact is, most older horses have health problems. The 18-year-old horses who still compete and win are rare, not the norm.<br>  <br>  And if you have a horse who is older AND has health problems, chances are they have to do with age.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can't say that every 18-year-old horse is as healthy as every 5-year-old horse. It's simply not true.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I agree with you that there are quite a few people on here with seemingly no experience saying "OMG!  He's too old, stop riding him immediately!!"<br>  <br>  In real life, every horse ages differently, and it's probably better for them to keep in work for as long as possible.  Some 18 or 22 year olds are "old" but some are definitely not.  I have a 28 year old pony my son rides that still enjoys bucking sometimes, tends to trot too fast, has no arthritis issues, and my son is learning to jump on him.  So, no age related health/soundness issues, but I have had to make some feed changes since his teeth are not up to chewing hay much anymore.  I know of many other older horses who act young, but have also seen a few that were old before their time.

ZddQ0XHmaa	Dachshunds are good in apartments because they are "compact", get plenty of exercise running around the living room, and don't shed too much. The downside, they can be very yappy. Dachshunds are sometimes prone to disc herniations which may require surgery or steroid blasting. Other than that, they are generally healthy, as long as you watch their weight (of course, weight must be watched with any dog).<br>  <br>  P.S. Dachsies sometimes get impacted anal glands, which is simple to maintain if you're not squeemish.|`|gjD8pndjaa	Doxies are usually healthier than Bostons, although they do have health issues of their own|`|KxjUim7yaa	I have found Dachshunds to be low maintenance. Bathe one a month, brush dally and trim nails about once a month. I have the vet do it for $12. But I think this would apply to a Boston too. As a hound, Dachshunds do bark. They are very smart and strong willed..Some people say they are hard to potty train ,but iI found ours easy. They do like to run and chase things. They could not be trusted around a small pet like a rat or hamster.They like to get into things, smell,chew and tear kleenex.They love walks with a harness.

Be ready to put in lots of time, unless you happen to find one that is unusually mellow. <br>  <br>  <br>  Both breeds are cute and sweet but it's hard to find a dog to match your lifestyle based on looks. From much previous experience with both, Doxies are mellow and good lap dogs that learn fast and don't have all those respiratory, indigestion, and eye issues due to the breeding. Also, never met a Boston who wasn't territorial, which can be annoying to deal with if you have to leave them for any stretch of time. They destroy stuff when they miss you so be prepared to bring it everywhere with you, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it!

Invest in a collar and a leash, and house train the dog the old fashioned way- by WALKING it.<br>  <br>  Its unbelievable what todays world has come to.|`|5jfEQAlwaa	No.. Dogs like to go outside.

You can call emergency vet & ask for their opinion, or call animal poison control @ 1-888-426-4435. <br>  Make sure you monitor your dog closely, if she starts acting strange, or she start shaking or vomiting, take her to vet immediately.<br>  Good luck.|`|b4NcFBhraa	Okay well first of all Watch her, it should be fine but keep an eye on her, if any habits or something changes or get worse, if irritation unfolds, take her to the vet.<br>  For now just keep a good eye on her, if you still have the bottle around somewhere or can get another one, look at the ingredients and see if it matches anything dogs shouldn't eat.<br>  Hope that Helps :D<br>  good luck with your "maltipoo"  :D<br>  <br>  ~ :D|`|5jfEQAlwaa	It depends what kind it was,how much she got.

3zv2bbolaa	Ear sets are determined by genetics. The changes that some puppies go through while teething is the result of changes in the thickness of the ear cartilage due to changing demands on the calcium levels in the body. Many dogs go through different ear sets between 4 - 8 mths of age and some breeders will assist the final ear set through bracing, taping or gluing of the ears during these months.|`|rVskthkiaa	<a href="http://www.caninecuties.com/8.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.caninecuties.com/8.php</a><br>  <br>  you can look at this website to find some good names|`|mfXDUkRYaa	Selective breeding.|`|yqrW1pfoaa	He/She might have had an ear infection.

B6zl0AJDaa	I've owned BOTH kinds and the leather ones are still with me.  In the early 90's I traded a set of corner plates for a Wintec Sport and grant it, it was a GREAT saddle, BUT the difference in sitting in one vs my now 40 year old Stubben Siegfried is like the difference between owning a Saturn and trying to compare it to a Mercedes.  Let's see if the Wintec holds up to the standards of a Stubben nearly 40 years later.<br>  <br>  If you're limited on funds, then try e-bay and find a good used saddle.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sporting-goods.shop.ebay.com/items/All-Purpose__stubben-saddle_W0QQ_catrefZ1QQ_flnZ1QQ_fromfsbZQQ_sacatZ111280QQ_trksidZp3286Q2ec0Q2em282" rel="nofollow">http://sporting-goods.shop.ebay.com/item...</a>|`|xi6avrGgaa	To know any kind of saddle information or buying saddles online, contact Saddleonline Inc . They are providing saddles online.|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	Kincade saddles are horrible, so I'd go for the Wintec 500 AP (the Wintec 250 has more of the suede stuff, which doesn't wear as well). I have a 5 year old Wintec 500 and it still looks brand new. They're easy to clean, comfortable, nicer than cheap leather saddles, and good quality. <br>  <br>  Also, the Wintec 500 AP does have a pretty deep seat (I've used mine for jumping & dressage ), so if you don't like saddles with a deeper seat, it may not be a saddle you'd like. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck!|`|cbbxV62Uaa	there is no way whatever saddle you get will fit a bunch of different horses no matter what tree size you choose as every horse is shaped differently. if you absolutely NEED to get a saddle for yourself to use on different horses, then i'd suggest getting a saddle with a wide tree that way you can supplement with extra padding when needed. however if you get a saddle with a medium tree and you're riding a horse the would require a wide one, there's nothing you can do to try and make if fit better.<br>  <br>  however as far as which saddle would be the best, i would go for the wintec 500. i'm not a big fan of the kincade, i've ridden in it before and it's comfortable but there's something about the way it fits a horse that i don't like. the seat's also too deep for me to feel comfortable jumping with. i don't care for the second one, there's no brand on the saddle which tells me that it's cheaply made with leather just as bad as the workmanship. out of the two wintecs i would go for the 500, the flaps are shorter and maybe even a smidge more forward and the seat's shallower which would be good for jumping, but it'll still put you in a good enough position for dressage.|`|otojKoEkaa	wintec 500 with flocking. What a great find at an amazing price. The wool flocking is soo hard to find and the cair panels are really bad for your horse's back. The wintec is a really comfy saddle. I really like mine. The gullet system is really great too because it allows you to adjust the saddle. <br>  <br>  I highly recommend that saddle. I had that one the upgraded to a 2000 which i loved even more but it  had the cair panels and made my horse's back sore. <br>  <br>  That price is fantastic too. My advice is by leather leathers as the synthetic ones are uncomfortable and crack and to get the saddle in brown in case you go to a jumping show because black saddles sometimes aren't allowed.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|bqbrKFeUaa	I'd have to say I like the second saddle the best. But if you know someone who owns a lot of saddles maybe go and sit on them to feel how they feel. I think that would be the best.|`|5UoMB7biaa	The wintec500. The second one has no knee roles which is not good for jumping. When you are to sit in the other saddles the back is very high, which will trouble your jumping. (: hope i helped.|`|EetfwNE9aa	i like the Wintec 500, it looks the best,and all the saddles i've ever had except for the saddle that i've got now, have been all wintec. and i like how they wear and tear as well. hope this helps :)
psNR7hDJaa	Box stall: Can come in lots of different sizes, most common are 12 X 12 or 10 X 10. The horse can lie down and move around more. <br>  <br>  Standing stall: Horse is tied up, they can't move too much around. They mostly have a manger in front of them. If the tie is loose enough, they can lie down. <br>  <br>  I prefer box stalls. And those are the only 2 types that I know of at the moment. I guess there is also foaling stall but its just like a box stall but bigger.|`|peDwXmQJaa	You can also have tie stalls and foaling stalls|`|RUxRNsf4aa	Well there is box stall, and mare and foal stalls, which are usually at least double in size. The box stalls are topically 10x12 or 12x12. After that there are other specifications, i.e. dutch doors, sliding door with grill, etc. Here is a good site about the sizes according to varying breeds and such: <a href="http://www.horsekeeping.com/horse_facilities/horse_stall_size.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsekeeping.com/horse_facili...</a>|`|xvEJbqtfaa	standing stall - cross ties with three walls.<br>  polo stall - minimal walls, like pipes.<br>  box stall - four walls and a door.<br>  run-in - not really a stall, but shelter.

zqVDJxUIaa	The 20 gallon with the new fish will be fine. You can add the rest of the fish you were planning to get into that aquarium, as long as you have a good filter system, one that has and output of at least 6 times the tank's volume per hour,<br>  <br>  For the 10 Gallon, I wouldn't add any more fish, just the plants. Think about it, if the Danios breed, where will you put all the fry?<br>  The most you could add would be the Java Fern and one Albino Cory.<br>  Bettas will normally be peaceful, especially if it's a female. Anyways, the Male Betta won't be fast enough to tough the Zebra Danios, don't worry. But no more in the 10 gallon, except for the Albino + Plant (but only if you have GOOD Filtration)!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Think: (I thought ahead, and looked at what you were ABOUT to add into your aquarium, not just the existing ones. If you add 3 males, will there only be females?<br>             The answer is : NO, there won't because there will be 5 females + 3 males! Phew! Some hard math there...<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you add 5 males, then your aquarium will be overstocked. Zebras grow up to about 2", and so the aquarium will be overstocked. There is also the problem with the fry you'll get from breeding. (Males+Females= Breeding, thank you very much). You'll be overstocking even if you go by the silly 1" rule! The one inch of fish per gallon = One inch of dead fish per gallon. The best general rule is:<br>  <br>  1" of tropical fish per 2 gallons, and<br>  1" of goldfish per 3-4 gallons.<br>  <br>  This will ensure optimal health, and will prevent stress.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|E047GSKdaa	Your beta will be fine with other non-betas.  I like the 1inch per gallon rule.  No more for the 10 gallon, a couple more for the 20 would be fine.  <br>  I would keep them quarantined though for at least a month in a small tank.|`|f8RBtCVAaa	the 20 gallon u can add about 5-7 more fish as long as u do weekly water changes that are at least 25% water change i think u should tank about 2-3 out of 10 gallon and add to 20 gallon 10 u should stop as for the 20 gallon u can add some more.|`|g4EZib5Vaa	No more in the 10 gallon tank. Almost too many in there now. But with smaller fish you can add 4-5 to the 20 gallon tank. Hope this helps!|`|jnzSz3tRaa	none in 10 gallon<br>  you can add 4 or 5 in 20 gallon|`|JxbAC4D3aa	I have a tank exactly like your ten gallon. The betta loves the company. Cory should have a bit more though as they are schooling fish. Either way your ten gallon is good. About bettas, other bettas and long finned colorful fish is bound to cause a problem. Now, on your 20 gallon, it's a little understocked, however, if that's how you like it then I guess it's ok. Hobbyist will sometimes say 1 in. of fish per gallon but this is only the easy way. Personally, I like to stock my tanks with several fish of only a few different species rather than a few fish of several different species. With that in mind, if you're getting rid of your silver dollar then you might want to consider adding about 5 more corys and several more tetras. Tetras and corys are schooling fish so it's recommended to have at least 6 of each. Since corys are strickly bottomfeeders and tetras are considered mid level swimmers, I would consider 10 corys and 10 tetras and maybe even a couple of angels or 3 fem bettas with plenty of places to hide. You will see the school of tetras swimming in the school as they stay away from the bettas.

F3FrZ7eAaa	First off, welcome to the reptile community! (:<br>  <br>  Not too long ago, I was contemplating getting a lizard. I decided to get a snake instead because they are very low maintenance, and become very friendly and great pets. Lizards and snakes are the same usually when it comes to handling, but frogs you can rarely pick up. This is because most have very delicate skin, and they can also absorb toxins with their skin, so it's bad for them.<br>  <br>  All snakes need it: a tank, a heating source (heat lamp, heat pad), bedding (newspaper, aspen), hides, a water dish and a thermometer/hydrometer. It might sound like a lot now, but trust me it isn't. Lizards need to eat daily, some need their tank misted, they need calcium, special lighting... it gets tough. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with lizards as pets, but in comparison to snakes they are harder to look after. <br>  <br>  Snakes eat once a week(less than that as adults), poop once a week, make no sound, don't smell. You can leave for a week, and as long as they have water, they will be fine (if heating is monitored). I have a ball python. Males need a 30 gallon tank as adults, but can be housed in something smaller as a hatchling. They get 3.5-4 feet, females get usually at around 5 feet full grown. Some other good beginner snakes are: corn snakes, milk snakes and king snakes. If you're looking for something even smaller, Kenyan Sand Boas stay a very small size. If you're looking for something bigger, Ball Pythons are my favourite.<br>  <br>  As for frogs, my favourite beginner frogs are White's Tree Frogs. The problem is, they can't really be handled. I mean they can, but it shouldn't be done very often. Some other good beginner frogs are Pacman frogs, tomato frogs and the very easy to care for fire belly toads. Fire bellies don't need any special lighting or heat, but they do require a semi-aquatic home.<br>  <br>  That's about all I can tell you. Start looking into particular breeds and their special needs.|`|T4tM4NWKaa	i would get a tomato frog u can get them at petco|`|2qgg2G8kaa	A bearded dragon makes a great pet for a lizard. I like the snakes though, always have. I currently own 5 snakes (2 king snakes, 1 corn snake, 1 ball python and 1 dumeril's ground boa). I think snakes make a wonderful pet. <br>  <br>  Reptiles and amphibians aren't affectionate types of animals. They don't cuddle with you, yet some do like some lizards. They aren't domestic animals either.<br>  <br>  I enjoy keeping snakes. They are a lot of fun to hold and their cage requirements are low, for some snakes. I suggest you get a corn snake or a ball python. Corn snakes and ball pythons are the best starter snakes. They are very docile and are not the nippy type of snake. They enjoy being handled and they are very curious. You will notice they roam their cages at night because snakes are nocturnal animals, as well as the ball python.<br>  <br>  Do some research on the corn snake and ball python. Find out their heat requirements, items needed, food, and such. It's also interesting so have these snakes as pets. They are really cool once they get used to you. My ball python is very very docile. I handle him almost every single day and he takes naps with me sometimes. :)|`|jDPULfjKaa	ignore the first short answers above me. iguanas require a diet that is 5% fruit, and more dark leafy greens and vegetables, not to mention they are extremely aggressive and need closet sized cages. turtles need an expensive aquatic setup, costs at least $450 for the filter, heat lights, uvb light, heater, food, decor, etc. lots of money. and is a dog a reptile!<br>  <br>  bearded dragons (i am comparing them to leopard geckos)<br>  <br>  bearded dragons are larger then leopard geckos, and need a 50-75 gallon cage. while a leo only needs a 10-20 gallon (for a few females) Bearded dragons require uvb lighting in addition to heat bulbs. leo's only need a heat emitter and a heat mat, no uvb lighting. leopard geckos and bearded dragons have almost equal temperament, and are both 'fun' and can both tolerate handling. so they are on an equal level right there. BUT the setup for a bearded dragon is 5 times larger, requires climbing branches, lots more substrate, and obviously the lizard requires a larger appetite. While leo's are more for beginner types (such as yourself) responsible children can keep leopard geckos, so i guess its an easier pet to keep, since its less expensive.<br>  <br>  frogs<br>  well. key terms: humidity. mold(sometimes). disease. tropical frogs require a high humidity enclosure, that has either,or plastic and live plants. the substrate needs to be something that can hold in moisture well, such as peat moss, and eco-earth. there need to be several hideouts and a water area that is heated by a small heater, and filtered by a waterfall type filter.,<--- like get a divider and create a water area, and a plant/land area. live insects isn't a problem you say, so no need to go there. but the insects to feed need to be more varied like crickets, silk worms, earth worms, meal worms, caterpillars, grasshoppers, etc, and they need to be gutloaded, which means you need to keep the insects and feed them a diet especially made for them (flukers makes this) and frogs are also very susceptible to disease, which means you need to keep a clean habitat at ALL times (this can be a hassle at times) frogs are not appropriate pets to be handled due to salmonella<br>  <br>  snakes-don't know that much about. but corn snakes and ball pythons can be handled very frequently, and they are ok with it. require infrared heat, a big enough cage (50 gallons at least) and do need substrate and a heat mat. do not require uvb lighting.<br>  <br>  it depends on your choice really. would you be ok just observing an ecosystem (like frogs) or will you want to handle the pet (like a snake)<br>  depends on you really.<br>  <br>  some setups<br>  <br>  bearded dragon setup:<br>  <a href="http://chernak.net/images/bearded_dragon/91303cage.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://chernak.net/images/bearded_dragon...</a><br>  <br>  leopard gecko setup:<br>  <a href="http://www.reptiletrader.co.uk/uploads/RT01087_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptiletrader.co.uk/uploads/R...</a><br>  <br>  fire bellied toad setup:<br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v307/huhwhat/FBTFEB07A.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v307/h...</a><br>  <br>  corn snake setup: <a href="http://www.stripersonline.com/surftalk/attachment.php?attachmentid=40856&stc=1&d=1175536337" rel="nofollow">http://www.stripersonline.com/surftalk/a...</a><br>  <br>  and those are all simple setups by the way.....do more research before deciding please.|`|GXFLWjE4aa	I would definatly not recommend an iguana because they require lots of space and tank requirements.

But I must you will have to be alright with feeding live or frozen rats.|`|kQYqDbc5aa	Your choices seem good but I recommend the leopard gecko.  They are very loving and very calm.  They do not bite or scratch.  In my fifth grade class, we had a gecko named Simba.  He loved all of the kids and we loved him.  He ate crickets and required a heating lamp and/or a heating rock.  <br>  <br>  If you do decide to get a gecko, I recommend a glass cage with a removable screen top.|`|Ja69k7Kvaa	iguanas.<br>  They eat fruit.|`|XgMoPrztaa	try a red eared slider turtle their fun loving and easy to take care of|`|AvY0cchPaa	Anything but a leopard gecko....|`|dcDg50gjaa	try a turtle :]|`|Z5zvhMIhaa	If you dont know then you should not, because there are to many unwanted reptiles in the world, people get them because they think its kool, and quickly become bored off them, only true reptiles lovers should own these beautiful creatures.....if you do decide to get one, please do your research, find one that suits your life style, and budget!!!!|`|rIr781BXaa	yu should just get a dog. =]|`|KXzUgTE0aa	kays answer-I do NOT reccomend iguanas, as they are very high maintanence reptiles. <br>  <br>  <br>  You should be looking into bearded dragons.

TmEoTapDaa	Beardies should be bathed everyday, for 15-20 minutes. Using your bath tub is easier. Fill it up to his armpits. If it fees too hot for you than it is too hot for your beardie. Put your hand in it, it should be a little warmer than luke warm. He should poop in the tub. Just be ready with a plastic cup to catch it and dump it in the toilet. Definatly go to beardeddragon.org/bjive|`|sxX3mGP0aa	NEVER bathe them every day, except perhaps babies who poop all the time. Some dragons love it, some hate it. Mine like to have the faucet trickling down; it makes the water move. I've never had a problem touching them while they're in there, and I usually let them stay in until the water gets too cold, they poop, or they try to jump out.<br>  <br>  Do leave them alone (watch them, but be still) for a while so that they can drink if they want. They don't like being observed while they do it, so just hide...<br>  <br>  And be prepared for the poo. If you pay attention and time it right, you can get them to almost always go in the tub!|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	I use one of those long plastic bins and the water temp is about 90 degrees. Maybe the water was cooling off too much. <br>  You  DO NOT bathe them everyday. Once or twice a week is fine. I do mine once unless they are shedding and then more often. I usually average about 10-15 minutes in the water. I dip water over them and let them rest on my hand if they want.<br>  In the summer when it is really warm, they have their own kiddie pool outside. The sun warms the water and I put a couple of rocks in the center for basking after their swim|`|eus7WqzUaa	Use a long tub.  Like a cats litter box-you can get one at a pet store.  He wants to swim.

They are humane wire traps that use a spring trigger to shut the door. Let them know what you are trying to catch and they will give you an appropriate size trap. Place some favorite treats on the spring pad and wait. Be sure there are no other food sources around because he wouldn't want the food in the trap. Usually they just let you write a check for however much and once you bring back the trap they give you back the check. Same thing with some pet stores. Call around and ask.|`|ct8MWxJOaa	i wouldn't kill him but i understand your point of view<br>  <br>  set a peice of cheese on the floor and wait quietly in a corner for him to come out<br>  <br>  then when he does, take a bucket and put it over him<br>  or something else that will work<br>  <br>  then you can sell him to a petstore or do what you want with him =)|`|6KxBqnstaa	Get a havaheart trap and catch him. It is humane and you dont have to touch the animal. Then simply put him in another cage that he can not get out of and train him or bring to a pet store who can take him. :) A net also works to catch and put in cage quick.

Rx7wv4JLaa	There are a couple of different options. You can try using a marker word like Yes instead of a clicker. Same idea for training but its by your voice. <br>  <br>  You can also try looking into targeting training. This usually involves using your hand/finger or a pole as a marker that helps to lure them into the command. <br>  <br>  On this site it talks about target training using the click but again you can just use a marker word instead. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clickertraining.com/node/289" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickertraining.com/node/289</a><br>  <br>  If you already have a fearful dog i'd stay very far away from any training involving punishment or aversive training. These types of training could make your dog worse.|`|iVQULHqYaa	Perhaps you can use the clicker training conditioning instructions  without using a clicker. In theory the clicker indicates to the dog that it has done what you want it to do. Perhaps a short exclamation like "wow" followed by a treat will achieve this. Long sentences are a waste of time.<br>  <br>  You should not try to train your dogs or try to get their attention in the presence of strange dogs, that's not what clicker training or any training is about. Investigate John Fishers training disks as these are helpful for distracting your dogs when necessary. <br>  <br>  Try again with clicker training or saying "wow" instead of clicking, however at the outset you should train your dogs separately.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	You can get clickers where you can turn the volume down, or use one of those clicky pens. If that is still too loud a snappy verbal marker as suggested above is a good idea.|`|1WmDOPGtaa	You can use a verbal marker instead.  Something short, such as "good" or "yay" (personally I use yay).  When you say the marker, make it short (not goooood, just good), and try your best to say it in the same tone and pitch every time.  Good luck!|`|c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	You don't have to use a clicker. Instead of clicking, just give him a treat and a pat on the head and tell him he's a good boy. I've found it to be just as effective as using a clicker.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Instead of a clicker, I just say something enthusiastically like "good boy! good boy Sit!" and then give him his little treat.|`|7Rp256IOaa	If your dogs like squeaky toys you could use the squeaker from one of them.  They would already have a positive association of it being with a toy and you could reinfoce that with treats too.  What about getting a small appliance like a flashlight or something that has a switch or a click on and off.  This is not uncommon.  There are plenty of sound sensitive dogs that don't fair well with the traditional clicker.  There are some that have less of a harsh click sound that might work too.|`|dXn8JaZjaa	positive reinforcement. (good dog!)
pYF9KnNeaa	It probably hasn't been non stop.  It may only seem that way.  But, don't be fooled by that other answer.  He most assuredly can get over weight.  If you are allowing him any sunflower seeds, that one of the worst things so far as fat content.  Since he is only 2 months, he may not be getting what he really needs so he very well could be over eating what he has.  At two months, he would probably still be taking some formula a couple times a day if you would fix it for him.  They usually don't totally wean until around 3 months, assuming they come from a reputable breeder who has not "force weaned" them.  If you are not providing anything but seeds, you are not giving him any where near the proper diet.  Another thing with seeds is, you must dump and refill the bowl, no less than once a day.  Tiels hull their seeds before eating them and the hulls usually drop into the dish.  That can make it look like there is plenty in there when in fact, there is no food left.  If you haven't done that, be sure to check it and refill it.  He may be searching through a lot of hulls, trying to find something to eat.  However, you don't want seeds to be more than about 20% of his entire diet and now while he is still very much a baby, is the time to get him started accepting a wide variety of foods.  He needs vegetables, fruits if you can get him to eat any, (many Tiels don't care for fruit) and many other people foods.  He also needs a good brand of pellets mixed with his seeds and you want a seed mix that does not have sunflower seedds in it.  Since he is so young, offer him some cooked, plain oatmeal, some scrambled eggs, cooked brown rice and cooked pastas, just to mention a few.  The fact is, he can eat almost anything you can eat.  There are some toxic exceptions though that he must never have so always be sure you have researched before offering him something.   Here are three links to help you get started with your research.  But don't stop there.  Search out other sites and consider joining a good Cockatiel message board where you can find experienced owners to help you out.  Good luck.            <br>  <a href="http://www.avianweb.com/toxicfoods.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avianweb.com/toxicfoods.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://birds.about.com/od/feeding/tp/poisonousfoods.htm" rel="nofollow">http://birds.about.com/od/feeding/tp/poi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.itsagreysworld.com/diet/food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.itsagreysworld.com/diet/food....</a>|`|RGQJfaCKaa	It depends on what he is eating. YES he will get fat if he is eating seeds or sugared foods. If he is eating pellets or vegetables then you are fine. Watch him though because 7 hours seems like a long time to me. My parrots only eat at breakfast lunch and dinner. They sleep during the day and play with each other. Hope this helps.
rTaaIXSuaa	I hope you aren't planning on breeding them because if you got a male and female expect to be having babies very soon. (They mate early)<br>  You have to give the mice some time to adjust to their new environment. My daughter has two mice as well and although it took not even a day for them to get social with her, some mice take a little longer.<br>  Every day make it a habit of socializing with them. If they are shy touch them or stroke them for a few minutes per day. They will in time get accustomed to this behavior and know that you are not out to hurt them. <br>  Be patient. They will get to know you soon enough.|`|hjCCqBQeaa	It might take a couple weeks till they get used to their new homes, but to get them used to coming to you, put your hand down on the floor of the cage and put a treat in the middle of your hand.  Wait a bit, and sooner or later they will walk up to your hand to get the treat.  It is a bad idea to swoop down to pick them up, because it reminds them of their preditor : the bird.

Her nipples will probably turn pinker and she will start producing milk. When she is about to go into labor her temperature will drop and her breathing rate increases. She may sit with her mouth open and even yell! (my foster did) She will lick herself and lose interest in food. Good Luck with your new kittens.

Nor do you have to worry about her tummy.  She will take care of herself, she knows how to give birth and when it's ready instinctively.  If she's showing signs of labor, then leave her alone in a  quiet, humid area.  About 20 minutes later, you can go to the den and see her kittens.  Let her groom them, and then let her feed them, and leave them with the mother for a couple weeks until their fur fully develops, genitalia develop, and eyes open for the first time.

AA11451616	it depends on the fish you want to keep.  If you want them to grow large, you will need a bigger tank at least 20 gallons for freshwater fish.|`|hZLkzuuiaa	a 5 gallon tank is really only good for one fish, maybe 2 if they're something that stays small, like guppies. You can get a 10 gallon kit that comes with a filter, a hood w/light and some accessories for around $30 at Petco. The only thing you should really need to purchase outside the kit is your decorations, a heater, and your fish. Even in a 10 gallon tank, you will only be able to keep 2 to 6 fish, depending on their adult size. General rule of thumb is one gallon of water per inch of adult fish. A 20 gallon or 29 gallon tank is still fairly easy to maintain, not huge, and you can have a wider variety and amount of fish in your tank.|`|qXQa06bAaa	The "BiOrb" / "BiUbe" tanks are supposed to be pretty beginner friendly (and space efficient)... but appear to cost more than your $50 max budget<br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/jdcouk_homegarden_usa-20/detail/B001GCU0YW" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/jdcouk_homegard...</a><br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/jdcouk_homegarden_usa-20/detail/B000QSK64Q" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/jdcouk_homegard...</a><br>  <br>  Spotted this one just within your budget, though:<br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/jdcouk_homegarden_usa-20/detail/B000260GEC" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/jdcouk_homegard...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a useful guide for getting started:<br>  <a href="http://www.tropicalfishcentre.co.uk/Setting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tropicalfishcentre.co.uk/Sett...</a>|`|wu65ibG6aa	theyre are plenty different tanks available in that price range you could get as big as a 20gal. it really depends on what you want to keep in it and how much you have to budget for filtration and aquascaping...could u be a little more detailed?|`|vg2PJlAdaa	if its going in your room go with a 10 gallon its a perfect size for a small room.. but remember fishes do grow so dont overload your tank 2 or 3 fish is enought.|`|f8RBtCVAaa	i will just tell u walmart tanks are so much cheaper than on line and pet shops. they con. u out of your money but walmart sells good tanks for good prices.|`|sNsdERusaa	I got a 10 gallon for $35 at walmart.

xe7mylLmaa	Well although its good that you are going to a vet to get a proper diagnosis, what it actually sounds like to me is the beginnings of the iguana's breeding season.  At four years of age, it is about that time when your iguana will reach sexual maturity.  Males during breeding season will turn an orange-ish color.  They also may have a decreased appetite.  It is also highly likely that the iguana will show increased aggression during this time.<br>  <br>  Here is a good website describing breeding season issues in iguanas:  <a href="http://www.greenigsociety.org/breedingseason.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenigsociety.org/breedingse...</a>|`|tyrY8Zxaaa	Well if you keep this up soon you won't be an Iguana Owner at all.|`|lbPz9nGyaa	This usually means he is lacking in vitammins but it could also be another case. This is a sign of some diseases. Good job taking him to the vet . Good luck, your not the dumbest iguana owner , this kind of ting happens to eveyone. Good luck..|`|dXn8JaZjaa	you need a better environment for him. do you have a heat lamp and hot rock? what kind of "bath" are you talking about? with soap? you probably have the ig's place too cold and the darker color is to help capture what heat is available.|`|TSQxwlbraa	You pretty much answered this question yourself.<br>  Just bring him to the vet or somewhere that will care for him.
AA10327148	I have met the breeders of Tarika, at the National Specialty. They were excellent breeders, and their dogs always placed, in both field and ring.. <br>  I don't know Tamaron, as they were not involved when I was.<br>  Their dogs are exceptionally nice. <br>  Good dogs,and good policies. <br>  I hope that you can visit them.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	I would say they are reputable. Especially with the showing and all. But I like to see more "true to life" pictures on a site also. I want to see what the dogs look like just hanging out, lounging around and running and playing. It's hard to really judge the temperament when the dog is stacked for show or in a field point for every picture.|`|3QqLYCJCaa	If you type "choosing a reputable breeder" or "choosing a breeder" into a search engine, you will get a list of websites that have things you should look for in a breeder and things you should avoid.|`|yLwKWzIUaa	looks good. but maybe go visit the breeder and ask her to show u the dogs and her facilities/kennel (it could be just in her home, it sonds like she doesnt have too many dogs sinse she doesnt breed all the time)<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|gjD8pndjaa	They, from what I can tell, are good.<br>  <br>  Visit them.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	I have no idea how good their dogs are as far as conformation, but they appear to be pretty good breeders. They do have some fairly questionable practices though. They have bred two of their bitches 3 times and one of them had a litter at 8 years old. That's pretty darn old. I'd proceed with caution. Maybe ask why they felt it was necessary to have such an old b!tc# whelp. They do have OFA registration numbers, which is good, but they don't mention any other health testing.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Checking out their page it looks like they have one litter a year and each time it seems like it's a different female whelping, which is good.<br>  <br>  Looking at the pedigrees there are a LOT of titles in there attached to names, including the parents. I didn't see anything about CGC or ATT which I would ask about. But seeing as Vizslas are hunting dogs I doubt temperament will ever be an issue.<br>  <br>  Any breeder that says "you can't have our dog if we don't like you" screams good breeder. Giving ONLY limited registration for pets and co-owning full registration puppies also screams "Good Breeder".<br>  <br>  If you want to go through a breeder I would say this is the one you should use. Contact her now and let her know you are interested in the breed and start doing YOUR research into the breed. Of course with this type of dog you may also look into breed rescues as well.|`|eDySIDPQaa	The pups look very healthy, however she kinda over bred Lexi, back to back breedings...<br>  <br>  she only has one stud listed in her kennel for breeding.<br>  <br>  I would want to email her with all my questions and ask all you can, then I would want a phone number to call them and speak directly with them..<br>  <br>  and, I would want to go and meet them in person, see the kennel, the dogs, the pups....I think she only has the dogs in home, no mention of kennel on the site..<br>  <br>  I would want to see both parents on site of the litters, no just one litter, all the litters she has at the time I am there to see the dogs.<br>  <br>  I would want references from previous owners, back at least 5 yrs, not just one or two from recent sales.<br>  <br>  Get a health cerificiate on the parents and pups and be able to speak to their vet...<br>  <br>  I would say why such a short health guarantee, all reputable breeders will give a lifetime health certificate guarantee on genetic defects, she does not...that is one thing that would back me off this breeder at once.<br>  <br>  I would want to see all the testing certificates on all of her dogs,not just the parents of the litter....they would need to prove to me they actually do test every dog they own...<br>  <br>  If they only have one stud on site, then they are overworking the poor guy, LOL<br>  <br>  research the breed fully and know what you need to ask them about the breed.,....if they know your a newcomer to the breed, they will most certainly try to pull the wool over your eyes to make a sale, but if reputable, won't have a problem at all  furnishing all the info you ask for.<br>  <br>  if, they do not want to furnish more than a couple references, walk away, no health certificate or testing documents, walk away..if you can't verify all that a kennel claims and have the proof, walk away, talk is cheap and many talk fast to make a sale.....don't get sucked in by cute puppies, that is a lot of peoples downfall, oh they look really good and are cute.<br>  <br>  It's your money, make them earn it......and make them live up to all their claims of their dogs and testing..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|S6ie5HwBaa	Sound pretty good, however I prefer the parents to also be Elbow score & eye tested too, hip testing alone isn't good enough for me. I don't see the point in buying a pruebred dog, if i don't plan to show.

I'd try calling them up and talking to them (and even meeting them) in person before making any major decisions though... you can usually tell just how good a breeder is if you can visit them. :)|`|a5CEuWDxaa	Well, the pups look in good shape (:|`|ldfE9vNGaa	Sounds like a very good breeder from the information above. The most important points -<br>  <br>  Breeding stock have OFA - that's good but do make sure to ask what the OFA rating was on each parent, and grandparents though. Also, do some research on other health concerns that may affect this breed and make sure that the parents have been tested for these also.<br>  <br>  3 year health guarantee - again,good, but double check what is covered and make sure that you understand exactly what it means.<br>  <br>  Member of Vizsla Breed Club - good<br>  <br>  Waiting List - good<br>  <br>  Overall, it sounds as though this is a reputable breeder who is dedicated to improving the breed. If at all possible I would recommend visiting the kennels and seeing the dogs first hand. If this isn't possible, ask for references from previous satisfied puppy parents - and follow them up.<br>  <br>  It's great that you are doing the appropriate research before buying a puppy. A lot of heartache could be prevented if everyone did this :o)<br>  <br>  Best of luck, hope you find your perfect pup.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	If I was picking that breed, I think I'd be inclined to get a pup from them.  They don't have a lot of dogs, but the quality is evident and they are testing and guaranteeing the dogs.<br>  <br>  I say a breeder worth buying from.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  To bluebonnie - that's not true at all.  I got my two pedigree show cats from top breeders and they both have websites to contact to reserve a kitten.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	I looked at virtually every page of this site.  It is not a good 'breeder' site, and is more an 'enthisiast' site.  I would buy a pet from this person only if I knew her personally and knew the dogs bred on both sides ... that's the 'give-away' as to this breeder, by the way.  She gives only the 'mother' and not both parents, yet she 'claims' to have a 'stud dog' (with no name or background???) ... keep searching and find a Vizsla breeder with an AKC 'seal' at the top of the site on the home page!|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	It looks good but what goes on in the back ground.  I have always heard & believe that reputable breeders do not advertise on the net.  They have enough contacts at the dog shows & need not advertise on the net.<br>  <br>  I would not have a dog shipped to me I would go pick it up & while I am there I would want to see the kennels & the rest of her/his dogs.  Be sure that you learn all there is to know about the breeder.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	They sound decent. Get a list of questions and give them a call. Call the Visla club and talk to them. The more questions the better.<br>  I agree with AussieMom the health guarantee should be for a lifetime.<br>  <br>  Don't get in a hurry, you only feel in love with them a few weeks ago. :)<br>  Visit some shows, maybe visit a Visla rescue.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	good breeder... with the exception of the 3 year health.   it should be lifetime on genetic health|`|fgxajTiBaa	In terms of quality they look to be good.<br>  <br>  However, I have an issue with the fact that they bred one of their b***** at 8 years old? And the other one they bred twice in one year.<br>  <br>  I would question that. That was the only sketch thing I found on their website. But I wouldn't say they only breed on occasion.<br>  <br>  Add: I wonder why so many TD's? When did it become okay to not give a dog a break between heats? And isn't it the resonsible thing to not breed a dog after 6 years old? I dunno, I'm sure they produce fantastic puppies, but I wouldn't support someone who is breeding their females so much.

dl1OOOT8aa	Generally labs and shih tzus aren't known to be a dominant dog aggressive dog breed. I think raising two young puppies at once will be suicidal really. If you want to keep the hair on your head, get one dog first and wait until the dog is at least 6 months or when he's trained and manageable. <br>  <br>  With strong pack leadership and good training, the two dogs will be absolutely fine as you planned. Remember to just introduce them gradually. I like to put them in crates and when they begin to ignore each other, I'll let them greet each other on neutral territory.|`|5bf08180c9f9ff092c1cac9f7edea283aa	it is better to get them at the same time. they will meet and be able to adjust easier. if you bring one in at a later date, it could affect their bonding with each other and both persons. it will be more potty training, but easier in the end. males are very territorial, but as puppies a lot less.|`|b1ycVXdwaa	There really is no issue. I just bought my second puppy and it was two years between him and my other dog. Getting two at the same time would be a bad idea because one puppy is bad enough with the whining all night and the accidents and the medical costs.|`|4aQhUHHwaa	you shouldn't get them separately because of the feeling some dogs and even humans get....intruder alert!! if you brought the shih tzu home first it may not turn out as well because they (as a breed) are known to be slightly territorial. labs on the other hand, are very welcoming and they love playmates. its ok to wait a small while to let one pup adjust, but i recommend no longer than a week between the two. if they grow up together, it is more likely to have a happier relationship with the dogs.<br>  <br>  - hope i helped!!!  :)|`|ubrYk78waa	I would say to get them at the same time. You will have to go through the having two pups that are whining at the same time and trying to train them at the same time, but they will learn from each other. Get them at separate times and you go through it more then once. But then again if you get them at different times the older pup will help you train the younger one. Who knows.<br>  Personal experience. My little, 20 lb Chi/Rat Terrier, was 5 years old when we got the Beagle pup. We have a dog door in the back door. The little guy trained the pup to go out. But the little guy if he got crowed would growl at the bigger Beagle and then back down. He even growls at the much bigger American Pit Bulls.<br>  The Beagle is only 6 months older then the first Pit so they were puppies and grew up together, no problem. The problem was with the second Pit. The older one was 5 years old and she would growl and snap at the pup. We used a technique from the "Dog Whisper" to get them to get along. They are best buddies now.<br>  My little Chi/Rat is the one that growls at the rest of them. The Beagle is always late for a nap. The two Pits are always running through the house play fighting.<br>  All I have to say is "Pests" and they all end up in the kitchen where the dog briskets are.<br>  Really get them at the same time and go through the training only once.
wF52XMxAaa	They're probably not.  Most conures are pretty active and playful, but there's more variation between individual birds than between these species of conure.

9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	At 13 years old, it's more likely that it's a health issue rather than a training issue. Just like humans, many dogs become incontinent in their old age. Just invest in some belly bands, they go around the dog's waist and act like a diaper for male dogs. Then speak to your vet about if there is anything you can do medically for him. Try not to get upset with him, that could actually cause him more stress and make it worse.<br>  <a href="http://malteserescue.homestead.com/MaltShopPages/BellyBamds.html" rel="nofollow">http://malteserescue.homestead.com/MaltS...</a>|`|h09gCzJgaa	13 years old is getting old for any dog, have you taken your chihuahua to the vet recently for exams? Our dog was really well trained but eventually could not hold her bladder that well as she go older and started having heath problems (same with my boss' beagle).  I suggest you try and rule out any underlying health problems first.  If there are no problems, continue with what you are doing, take the dog out to pee first, do not give too much water tho - of course the more they drink the more they have to pee, and furthermore, walk him a little before putting him inside to tire him out so he will go to sleep|`|rVskthkiaa	<a href="http://www.petvideo.com/index.cgi?category=18" rel="nofollow">http://www.petvideo.com/index.cgi?catego...</a><br>  <br>  use these videos to train your dog again|`|XkJBLhlKaa	He is 13 years old, maybe he just can't hold it like he used to.|`|7Rp256IOaa	Being 13, your dog is getting on in years.  A change in routine can certainly upset the apple cart with an old fella like this.  I would first have him fully checked out by the vet to rule out any urinary problems like incontinence.  <br>  Do you give him anything in the crate to occupy himself like a stuffed kong or other dog toys?  You could add a cue of turning on music means you will be leaving him for a few minutes but you will be back.  Then increase the time you leave him with the music playing.  Once he realizes he isn't going to be left forever and settles in his crate, you can use the music whenever you leave the house to cue him you will be gone for a while but then will return.  <br>  It could very well be his age/change in routine.  Be patient with him.  He has been your companion for a very long time and needs some understanding.  We can't all be expected to act as we did as youngsters.  Consider getting a belly wrap for him.  Your crate will be clean and you will only have to clean the wrap (and his belly of course).
DLxh9CANaa	If you have a question about what's legal and what's not, the best place to find the answer is the USEF RULE BOOK. Look in the section under " Drugs and Medications" , and look up the ingredients in your mare's supplements to see if they are legal or not, or if they are on the list of banned or restricted substances. Since you are showing in Hunter/Jumper and the Eventing divisions, you must already be a member of the USEF, and should have no trouble getting a copy of the Rule Book. <br>  <br>  The other thing you can do is ask your vet if he or she is aware of any ingredients in any of your supplements which might be prohibited under USEF rules. Many times, vets are aware of such things, especially if they see or treat a lot of show horses like your mare. <br>  <br>  Good luck- I hope this helps.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	I have never heard of normal, over the counter supplements being illegal for shows of any type.

If you like the idea of people dying from preventable diseases than eliminating animal testing is for you.|`|fBYInMlNaa	I'm veggie, too!!!!  And I HATE HATE HATE animal testing.  Test it on criminals instead.|`|OrvTG44laa	I agree.  I don't understand it at all.  Humans and animals are different, no matter how similar they are.  For example, humans can eat chocolate and be fine, but it is deadly to dogs.  They commonly use monkeys because of how similar they are to humans.  But monkeys can die of a common cold, where it is very rare for that to happen to a human.  As you can see, animal testing is never going to give us legitimate results.  And think of how far science has come along.  Don't you think that testing could be done on cells?  Why not take a sample of human skin cells and test the products on that?  With all the advances in science, I really don't see how this would be unpractical.  Thirdly, it is simply unnecessary.  Do we really need another brand of shampoo?  Don't we have enough lipsticks?  How much makeup do people need to have?  <br>  Some people say it is only right if used for medicine purposes.  Well, why can't we test it on a sample of human cells?  Why can't we simply take a sample, test the medicine on them and see the results?  Wouldn't this be a lot less expensive, considering the fact that there is no more money needed to care for the animals being tested on?  Wouldn't this have true results, because actual human cells are being used?  <br>  And the answer to why this isn't being done is because too many people don't care about animals.  While scientists will spend years researching a quick way for people to lose weight or a new medicine that makes your wrinkles disappear, no one has made any efforts to find an alternative to animal testing.|`|b8by7fSKaa	So you would rather save an animal rather than saving a HUMAN??

pYF9KnNeaa	Assuming your bird is healthy and on a proper diet that includes plenty of calcium rich foods, including a never ending supply of cuttle bone, you are not likely to have any advanced warning.  Her behavior may change a bit and she may be trying to find a dark, private place but beyond that, your first hint will be that an egg will suddenly be there.  However, if you see her appearing to strain, sitting very low to the floor or to the perch, and breathing hard, then she may be in trouble.  If she is really trying to lay and if she has not had a proper diet with the all important calcium, she could be egg bound.  That happens when where is not enough calcium in her system to make firm egg shells.  When they are soft, she cannot pass them.  That is a life threatening situation and without immediate recognition of it and proper intervention, she will die.

OWIiJMLqaa	I feel bad for Thymine, she is being constantly harassed for sex and she is probably already pregnant, I think anyone/anything would be less than happy to see their mate if all they ever wanted was to breed, even when she is already preggers. Get Uoof his own cage, he is making a pest of himself, and before long Thymine may really go off on him, if she does he may lose his testicles. Actually I changed my mind, get Thymine a cage roughly twice the size she has now. You will also need a nest box, because in less than 30 days she may be delivering babies. The stain on her head is buck spray, Uoof marked her head to tell the world she is his,or he may have got upset that he couldn't get to breed her and just mounted her head..pretty gross.

I have raised rabbits for many years and can walk you through the process.|`|62deca1d37dad9f560583c21f5dd1721aa	I used to raise rabbits at one time. If you have a pregnant rabbit do not keep her together with any other rabbits besides her babies. The mother will become protective and sometimes violent.  I advise you to purchase another cage. or maybe a few. <br>  <br>  Be careful with how many rabbits you end up with. And also keep them separated, ESPECIALLY THE MALES, since they can become violent with one another.  It can be a pain buying new cages for every rabbit.|`|lNzhglLFaa	you are VERY lucky that they liked each other to begin with.. bunnies can really do some damage....<br>  <br>  get another cage.. it is clear that she doesn't want to be with him....<br>  <br>  the stains you are seeing is your bunny spraying on the other bunny... it is the way they say "this is my space" they don't want to live together...<br>  <br>  bunnies are VERY hard to keep together unless you get them from the same litter and the are the same gender....|`|Cq7vnrFhaa	Well it could be that it is part of the prossess that bunnies get grouch and moody ( sortta l.ike women do) and then start a fight with there mate.

It's a good idea to keep them seperated so bunnies can have their own space even though they are social animals. Rabbits can get stressed very easily and don't like change. Time will fix this and then soon they will form a bond and they will live together happily. Males rabbits who are not neutered will spray just like males cats do. They mark their territory and can show aggression. Female rabbits left unspayed have a high rate of ovian cancer and will have their moody moments as well. To ensure a happier bun its good to get them neutered and spayed. They were probably happy to see each other first, its exciting to bunnies when they meet another new bun (most of the time) but that wears off. You can keep them in cages next to each other, or section off part of a room so the can roam and sniff each other through the cage bars to help ease the anxiety and aggression in the mean time. Here's a wonderful website that helped me with my rabbit questions and has a wonderful section on bonding rabbits and a lot of people who are willing to help answer questions: Rabbitsonline.net
c398e7ae6f2789a3d3c5f715afc652a3aa	Like others said, you can't do that to an animal that small, they wouldn't survive the operation.  Either get two males, or two females.  From what I know from having mice, male's pee does smell more than females's.  Females also tend to be very protective of themselves, too, like biting protective, because of their instinct that they are able to nest.<br>  <br>  From my experience with male dogs, neutering does *not* make them less aggressive.  My youngest still shows dominant behavior, "mounts" girl dogs and stuffed toys, and marks his territory.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of vets who are reluctant to work with animals other than cats and dogs due to the issues unique to small animals such as "rodents" (which do not have the lifespans of dogs or cats).|`|OKzU1TJraa	Hamsters are Solitaire!

769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	Okay, at the risk of multiple thumbs down from extremists, if you live in a rural area and don't have neighbors who leave poison out for stray or pesky neighbors animals (good luck discovering this because it's the crime of a sick mind, so no one who does advertises) it might be okay for them to be outdoors some.  Ideally, you would be outside with them and they would be trained well enough to come when called.  If however, you live in a populated area, please know that the average life expectancy of an outdoor cat is 18 months, indoor-outdoor cats is 3-5 years and strictly indoor cat is 18 years.<br>  <br>  If you choose to continue with your plan of having them be indoor-outdoor, you will need to keep a litter box indoors for them.  You can't regulate when they have to go and if they don't have a box, they might get angry with you and use your bed or shoes instead.  You need to also be prepared to deal with the "presents" they will hunt and leave for you at your doorstep, or if they can jump in the window, in your house.  These birds and rodents often carry disease, which your cats might catch from killing them.  You need a plan to prevent their contracting these diseases and a plan for riding your porch/home of the carcases and cleaning germs afterwords.  And for heaven's sake, make sure you praise kitty for bringing you such an honored gift.  Don't make the mistake of fussing at her for it.  It comes with the territory of having a cat that spends time outside. <br>  <br>  They will need safety collars that snap loose if they get hung on something so they are literally hung to death.  You can buy them at any pet supply store.  Get extras and buy extra rabies tags too, as they do come off and get lost regularly.  You don't want kitty in the hands of animal control because a neighbor thought it was a stray (or tired of her going potty in her rose beds) for lack of a collar.  And you don't want a ticket because kitty didn't have on a rabies tag.  So, stock up.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, put them on a high quality,  preferably organic, diet and their litter box won't smell nearly as much.  Newman's Own, Royal Canin and Nutria are good choices to look into.|`|xgKQrEhqaa	Rural areas mean predators: hawks, eagles, coyotes, foxes, if kitties are frightened to venture far they may know something you don't.|`|R3F0BV6Jaa	you can't wean a cat off the litter tray because the days when it's in and you're out it'll have to go somewhere but if you want them to go out more often I'd suggest putting them out wwhen you go out then letting them in when you come home and when they want to go out on their own make sure their out for more than 1 hour that way you will be giving them the chance to experiance the outside properly instead of letting them out only to let them straight back in and if you really want them to go outside instead of using the litter every time you see them heading for the litter tray put them out and do'nt let them in for an hour till they've had chance to empty themselves but as I said you should'nt force them to stop using the litter tray for those days when you're out and their in and they'll want to go somewhere.|`|duipqjRUaa	Hi there kittens are not a problem to train,however you shouldn't try to force them to go out side to do there toilet after all they have been used  to using a litter tray so  that is the only place they know .but you will fiend in time that they will start to go out side and fiend there favorit spots to do there toilet.I hope you have had your kittens muted as they can easy become attracted to all the male cats,you wouldn't want that to happen   now would you?all the best with your new kittens. from winifred s|`|7i8ZKUQZaa	cats are meant to be inside pets why would you let your cats out side i say leave them in where you know where they are and they are safe from other animals cars and anything that could hurt them don't ween them off the tray so basically you want your cats to be out doors and don't want the responsibility to go along with them it up sets me alot when people do this they are happy inside leave them if you cant stand a litter box then give them to some one who will what do you do when its cold out??|`|AA12398420	Why do irresponsible people get pets?|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	When you first let kittens outside they will not go very far.   Just a few yards from the house.  This can go on for some time as they gradually build up their confidence to explore further.  It might take a while before they are off exploring properly.   Cats are very cautious creatures and like to feel secure in what they are doing.<br>  <br>  They also like to be warm!   My cats hardly ever want to go outside during the winter months, but once spring is here they are outside all day long.<br>  <br>  They're the same as humans, they do not really like to be out in the cold and rain, but they love to be out their on warm spring days.   So you may find that as the weather improves they will want to go out more and more.<br>  <br>  As regards the litter tray, it very much depends whether you have a cat flap or not, and whether they will have permanent access to the outside.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a cat flap, then you will need to keep a litter tray in the house for when you are not there to let them out.<br>  <br>  If you do have a cat flap then they will train themselves to start doing their business outside, once they get familiar with the great outdoors!     It takes a little while, but they will see other cats doing it outside and they will start to copy.     Once they do, you will find that they will automatically stop using their litter tray.

Continue to repeat until he learns not to use his mouth for fun.<br>  Any tricks: You can teach puppies MANY tricks and it's easy too!<br>  Speak: if he's already a natural barker then say speak when he barks and reward him each time after you say speak. If he barks when people come to the door say speak or "who's there" and give him a treat when he barks. My dog only barks on command but some dogs may get the wrong idea and just bark for fun so be careful with this choice of trick.<br>  <br>  Roll Over: Make him Lay down and put a treat right in front of his nose, move the treat to  his eye level and  bring it in a wide circle from his nose to the carpet(or wood) and  drag it along the wood and up around his head again, pair this with the command :Roll Over    or go'Round<br>  <br>  Jump up: Make the dog sit and with a treat place in infront of his nose and lift it high saying "Jump" or  "Jump up" and if he jumps reward him if he kind of sits up, hesitate, then reward. Continue until results are as you expect.<br>  <br>  Crawl: Make him lay down and put a treat on the floor infront of him, holding on to it, drag it along the floor and say "Crawl" <br>  Continue to repeat until results are as you expect.<br>  <br>  My dog knows ALL of those tricks and I taught them all like that so good luck :D|`|a6an2aN0aa	It's called Dog Training For Dummies|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Neuter him and enroll him in a basic obedience class in your local Petsmart.<br>  <br>  He's not a Rapist, he's a dog.

AA10633378	The only real way is to get the number on those bands/rings (tags)  Once  you get those, depending on what letters they start with I can send you to the correct National club site to track the owner.  If it really is a homing pigeon and not another bird like a roller or show bird, then it likely is looking for food and water since it may be lost.  If you can provide both (not bread, but rice, corn, peas, wild bird seed - all uncooked) and water in a container that's at least an inch deep that it can drink from, then it will likely soon head home once its reserves build back up again.

I lost my job, and that's what I had to do to feed the kids last week.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	it has been proven that people who own dogs have lowered blood pressure.<br>  <br>  so i don't understand why you would want to get rid of the dog.. perhaps you could train it<br>  <br>  and daily exercise is EXCELLENT for people with; hypertension.. so your wife should start walking the dog<br>  <br>  <br>  I think you just don't want the dog and have made this up|`|3zv2bbolaa	As noted, research shows hypertension is usually reduced by the presence of a pet. One idea is to take the pet to training classes, become involved in more recreational activities with the pet to help alleviate some of her energy and boredom issues and that will also have the benefit of helping your wife reduce stress levels. <br>  <br>  I have high blood pressure as well and survive all sorts of dog incidents without heart failure. It's a matter of medicating, exercise and diet! Don't blame the dog!|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Yes.  Here in the UK we have several websites that help with people in this situation.  Preloved (you advertise for a minimum fee & when you advertise make sure you write that all potential homes will be checked out), Gumtree is also a good place to advertise. Put an advert in the local Shops, Post Offices & Newspapers. Have you asked your friends & relatives if anyone fancies taking her on that way you will still get to see her. Good luck I hope you find her a permanent loving home soon.|`|2WWEn2mZaa	I agree with AUSSIEMOM. Getting rid of the dog makes no sense. The dog would be beneficial. Pets are stress relievers and walking a dog would be the best kind of exercise that your wife NEEDS to do. Sorry, but it sounds like an excuse.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Contact a local shelter and see i they'll put a courtesy ad on petfinder.com for you.|`|bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	your doctor is insane! Rehoming the dog is more stress than a chewed shoe for a caring owner! <br>  However I'd suggest a breed club rescue - most of the show breeder associations have a rescue that will take their breed - some take mixes of their breed some do not- I'd give you a link but you didn't say breed<br>  <br>  Ps be very careful about stress reducing advice from a doctorr - stress is different things to different people. My mom had a hypertension dignosis after the doctor kept her in waiting room for 5 hrs (she was frantic) - he told her to drink a glass of wine with dinner to relax. My mom had been raised with much emphasis the evils of drink - the idea she could NEED a drink worried her so much her blood pressure skyrocketed!
GdBG4PGYaa	I would put him up for $35 as he is mixed breed, but has had is shots and is a kitten. Most shelters put their kittens up for $65 dollars.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped! :) Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  It is a good idea to make a fee. Many people not buying the kitten as a pet, but to sell to labs put on fire (thrill seekers), etc. They don't want to have to pay. Make sure you know this person has a good reputation with pets. :)|`|RN1wGlWWaa	IMO I'd spend the money for neutering to be sure he's not allowed to breed.  He could have been done by 3-4 months old - why is he not neutered?<br>  <br>  If you neuter him, then charge $100 rehoming fee.  People like it more if everything has been done before adoption.|`|8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	Honestly I think someone promising a fine home for him is suitable.<br>  <br>  Maybe if he were neutered I would say 30-50 dollars.<br>  <br>  You did a great thing in helping Anakin.<br>  Most people wouldn't have been as responsible as you are.<br>  If you have the vet bills and documented history you could try to get reimbursed for those fees.<br>  I just think that it may be difficult requesting a fee for you generosity.<br>  Although if you have documentation you may be able to have the interested party reimburse you.<br>  <br>  To me there should not be a price for rehoming a cat.<br>  Its called kindness|`|AA12282328	I got my mixed kitten for free.  Gave him shots and neutering myself.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	i'd say 45 dollars :]

GXFLWjE4aa	Well you can tell them how they dont smell bad or how they arent very costly and how they virtually make no noises and care is so easy that your parents will basicly not know the snake exists ofcourse this all depends on the type of snake a Ball Python would be easiest.|`|tifJaxfEaa	What is their arguments?<br>  <br>  <br>  You can convince them it is cheaper than a dog in the end.
QnCR3cYiaa	You are part of her territory|`|MVY8xhXlaa	It thinks you're hot|`|DuFUWSLoaa	There can be a number of reasons why this is happening.  It might be that your cat, being 7 months old, doesn't really know where to go to the bathroom.  Another could be that he likes you and is marking his territory around you, a natural instict for cats is to pee around their territory.|`|krtYT43laa	There might be many reasons for this 1. He might not be Litter trained 2. He might want to mark his territory it depends on strength on smell or 3. he might have a bladder infection it might be 1 or 2|`|H2RQYsp0aa	either you didnt watch it to go to the bathroom or it doesnt like you|`|b3ZLY5osaa	girl or boy cat?
zTeLhroWaa	Use a spray bottle filled with 1 part water/2 parts hydrogen peroxide.  It will kill any bacteria in the tank without leaving a harsh chemical residue.  Just spray it on, wait 5-15 minutes, and then wipe it off.  Super simple.|`|CtK04QcVaa	You can use vinegar water. I think the mix is water 2 to 1 vinegar. Its safer then chemicals.
hq9rM7Eqaa	We've had to do this before.  Some will get along right off the bat, others, usually different clans, will not.  In that case, keep them separated by a door so they dont feel threatened but can still smell each other.  A day or 2 later, switch their rooms so they can get used to each others scent.  There are bound to be some hissing fits between them just to figure out who will get the top dog position, in the end it just takes time.|`|0UV0PwDLaa	I used to have over 20 cats, in my opinion, its best to just let them fight it out.  The kittens won't hurt the unborn baby, and its good exercise for both the mother and the kittens. Unlike dogs, cats practice allot of battle chivalry, and aren't likely to hurt another cat. <br>  <br>  You may want to feed them together, or let them play in a room together and just watch to make sure they don't do to much damage.|`|SgeIPqKlaa	I suggest you get them to be friends before the cat gives birth!! Introduce her to one kitten at a time in a quiet room.  Make it a positive experience by giving them praise and treats if they are being friendly to each other. If they start to fight, pick up the cat that did not start the fight, or the one that is less angry!!!  You need to get the cats to be friends before the new kittens come or the mother could or will hurt the kittens you have now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GOOD LUCK!!!!
1WmDOPGtaa	Were both the parent's purebred or is it possible that one (or both) were mixes also?  I would say it's not common, but genetics are a funny thing and often surprise you.|`|5jfEQAlwaa	Yep !! It's just like humans we don't weigh what our parents do. It can go way back. Just enjoy him ;)|`|Npfxb3SSaa	My bet is that the dad is pure breed or close to it? He is probably very small for his breed and i bet if you look at your dogs uncles and aunts he will match up well. Also, you might be feeding him a better feed than his parents got, which has a lot to do with size. I have a dog that was feed a better food than his litter-mate. When they were 3 months old they were the same size and now my dog almost doubles his brother.|`|1HxrA0Qxaa	you shoudnt really be worring because think of it as a perspective with humans you can be taller then your mother and your father i know some people been taller then both. so dont get stressed as long as he is healthy and strong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|dcDg50gjaa	its not common but its okay if ur dog is bigger <br>  its about the genes that ur dog inherited from<br>  his parents|`|yqrW1pfoaa	VERY COMMON!!! :) My dog is the runt of his litter and he turned out to be the biggest dog in his litter!!!
b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	'go to the vet|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Yes go to the vet it could be an allergic reaction, a thyroid condition or Cushings disease.|`|dXn8JaZjaa	could be that he walked through something toxic or, like humans he is having a bout with CHF (congestive heart failure). some of the signs and symptoms are edema (swelling) of the extremities (hands and feet).<br>  <br>  go to the vet.|`|tY14vbrKaa	Irritation, allergy, and yes, it should be seen by the vet.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Contact allergy, maybe?<br>  Yes, take him to the vet and see what he says.

1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	If you are asking this question, you need more riding experience. By 5 years, you should know that breed of horse doesn't really mean anything- you want a horse with conformation for what you are doing, and a personality that fits yours well. The breed of the horse has little to do with it, except for conformation reasons. <br>  <br>  If you get a horse that is a specific breed, but doesn't match your personality, you are going to have a tough time riding, and not enjoy it as much as you would with a horse that matches your personality.
rXMTdUg4aa	Its an ear hematoma. Its not painful but it is uncomfortable. I assume your dog has been shaking his head? When a dog shakes its head, the blood vessels in the ear bust and cause the ear to fill with blood. Take your dog to the vet. They will put him under, lance it, and suture in a drain. Some antibiotics and he's good to go.<br>  If you choose not to do this, the blood will subside and return, subside and return... resulting in what we call cauliflower ear. The ear crinkles up a bit. Again... this is not painful just uncomfortable when the ear hematoma is present. The other thing that could happen is... it could get very large and full. Your dog could scratch at it and bust it open. This will make your house look like a slaughter house. There will be blood everywhere. lol. I recommend you take your dog to the vet:)|`|3zv2bbolaa	It is called an aural hematoma and is caused by blood filling up the area between the skin and cartilage. Dogs who scratch or shake their heads frequently due to ear infections or other irritants tend to get them.<br>  <br>  It can resolve on it's own in about six weeks if the source of the problem that is causing the dog to shake it's head is resolved, but the texture of the ear will change to a crinkly feeling with scarring. <br>  <br>  The other option is to have your vet place a drain tube in the ear flap and allow the ear to drain slowly. While this is done, the vet can also treat the ear infection and help solve the source of the problem.|`|heC9aQ18aa	My Pitbull has one too and if it is the same thing (which sounds to me it is) it is nothing serious and nothing to worry about. I applaud you for being a caryng "owner" to your dog.|`|w9pvYSikaa	My boxer had a few of those, very irritating for them.  It is filled with fluid that needs to be removed.  They can take it out by needle if it isn't to bad, or have surgury.  My dog had to have surgury for this.  They sliced open his ear to remove it, then he had his head wrapped in gauze and a cone on his head for awhile afterwards.  Please ignore the first answer.  They can be very painful too.  Get this checked out by your vet. <br>  Best of luck, hope everything goes well :)|`|Re576Xa5aa	ok, so I know this is probably way off Everyone else already nailed it<br>  <br>  <br>   but my dog has a little part on his ear that is like a flap behind the main flap. It is a pocket, but not really closed on all sides,|`|FDgarm4Zaa	my black lab has one of those :) nothing to worry about !
A7XV2K3Paa	My vet has never suggested it. I have never had a problem with my cats bothering their stitches.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	None of my females had to use the cone.  Just watch so she is not bothering the stiches or her belly by washing.  If she does, then she will need a cone.<br>  <br>  The incision will look puffy for awhile, but unless its really red or hot feeling, then everything is ok.|`|KLMo9jbzaa	Usually they won't mess the stitches, but if you feel the need to put a cone and have no money, just make one out of cardboard and tape it on leaving it loose around the neck. everyone has cardboard and tape around the house if you don't then you will need to stand guard so she doesn't lick anything.|`|UlOKMInqaa	The cone is so that the cat won't lick the surgical site. Watch your kitten, if she doesn't lick it then you probably won't have to worry about it. However, if you catch her licking it, you should go buy the cone so that she can't irritate the stitches. If you can't be with her during the day to watch her licking behavior, then you should also get one so that you can prevent anything that she does to herself while you're gone.|`|kZrZCPRMaa	Well i got my cat spayed like 2 weeks 1/2 ago and shes 5 1/2 months old the doctor never warned me about it but they check up on it a couple days ago and reminded us to do so and also put Neospiron<br>  i didnt buy the cone but i've been putting neospiron and her wound is much better(:<br>  <br>  its almost gone from the spay <br>  <br>  the cone is not really nessasary it just stops them from licking<br>  just put neospiron and watch when she licks make sure its stopped.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	i didn't need the cone for my kittys. i think she'll be just fine. keep a close eye on her just to make sure she doesn't mess with it or it's not getting infected.|`|ey5Xqm6Caa	No, you don't need a cone. It is just an extra precaution. I have had at least 50 cats spayed/neutered and have never had a problem with them messing with their stitches without a cone. Just look at her incision every day to make sure it doesn't look like it is getting infected. Make sure she doesn't run, jump, and play too rough for the next week and she will be good to go!|`|DuFUWSLoaa	I would keep an extra eye on her, the cone for her neck is so she doesn't try to itch the area, and accidentally scar.  Just keep an extra eye on her when she goes to the bathroom, and when she is around you.  Otherwise, I would definetly go back to the vet and get that surgical cone.|`|7i8ZKUQZaa	well i have had all of my cats fixed except for my new little Angel only 12 weeks or so but none of my cats needed the cone i guess it just depends on the vet i mean if she constantly licks it then maybe u should get one but i never had one idk?!?!
ZYzhBhgJaa	I would give away the shark, it is semi-agrressive, and will go after your fish. Also a 10 gallon tank is too small for a rainbow shark, I would give him to someone who has a larger tank.|`|FDgarm4Zaa	i actually had this problem, only mine wasn't with a rainbow shark. i had a zebra thing (i dont remember what it was called) and a bigger more aggresive zebra thing. (haha) my bigger zebra fish actually ATE the eye off of the smaller zebra fish. i actually had to flush the smaller zebra fish because it was dying, but i was afraid that the big zebra fish would eat my mollies (theyre cute) haha, anyways, i took out the big mean fish and got one of those small tiny glass fish tanks from the pet store and made it live in there. my advice is that you do the same thing. my big zebra fish also sliced my other fishes tails tooo. good luck !|`|NcVkRA6Qaa	Mollies are community fish where as the sharks are semi aggressive, not a good combo at all you will either have to divide the tank or get another tank. If you do not want to do either of those, you can always see if your local pet store will trade the shark for something less aggressive like platties, tetras, guppies etc.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	you need to get a tank divider
LPEO6AsCaa	Try looking into Canine rescue dogs in 911.  There were many, many dogs used after that terrible day to help to locate not only people who were still alive but their remains also.  <br>  <br>  Personally I'd like to see something honoring them there too.|`|W7pIDNzhaa	I think that NY City would be the ideal place. First of all we have all those dogs that helped with rescue during 9-11. They really should be recognized for their bravery, but also the AKC dog show has been going on there since 1877. So to me it just seems a natural for a monument to dogs to be no where else.

5oQbDhl2aa	i think they're either old or sick, ready to die. my beta fish did that for two months before he died. either that or maybe the water is too cold, test it out and see.|`|AA10229892	One, you cant float at the bottom of a tank. You sink. Two, if they are on their side he is very sick. No fish can swim that way. Check the water temp, clean the tank. And if you cant see its mouth moving its dead|`|FDgarm4Zaa	no they dont sleep like this. your fish is dead or is very sick and is getting ready to die. the reason why it moves when you knock on the tank is because the water moves them because they aren't heavy. im sorry ):|`|af9Vs1AGaa	OK 2 easy ways to check. See if its breathing. Also take it out of the tank and see if it responds. Here are some reasons why its like that:<br>  Sick<br>  Got attacked ( Check fins it it got nibbled or eatten)<br>  Old<br>  Over Stressed<br>  Dieing from laying eggs and to much for her.<br>  <br>  Try to add some stuff  ( see how much at back ) to reduce stress. Also if its from a dieses remove it from tank.

w8v7AhOBaa	I have no clue where Penticton is, but it depends on the rarity of the breed of Leopard gecko you get. Normals can range from $25-$50 where i live, but when you get into rarer colors and morphs, you can tackel anywere from $75-$1500 just for the gecko. Of course you need to factor in the cost of the tank (20 gallon Long) minimum size, 2 heat lamps, day time and night time, REPTILE CARPET FLOORING! do not use sand untill you become very knowledgable. Also a steady supply of crickets or mealworms should be found from a supplier like Fluckers, or a local pet store. Hope that helped,<br>  <br>  Total cost for my set up for 2 Leopard Geckos:<br>  Tank: $35<br>  Lamps: $43 for two with temp adjustments<br>  Bulbs: $14<br>  Cage Carpet: $17<br>  Dry hide, wet hide, and feeding dishes: $30<br>  1000 Mealworms from Fluker Farms: $20 (enough food for MONTHS)<br>  Leopard gecko #1: $40<br>  Leopard gecko #2: $79 <br>  <br>  So $280 total, but thats with 2 geckos, one being a bit rare.

qsnZSYpgaa	Honey you need to palpate your rabbit at this stage.  put the rabbit flat on the ground hold its head steady and then slide your hand under its butt.  now the butt will be up in the air you want your thumb on one side and two fingers on the other.  push until you can almost feel your fingers on the other side or you can.  You will want to start right behind the rib cage and work your way down.  you are looking for rip blueberry sized bumps that are slightly plighable.  If you feel more that 1(just one is poop) then she is pregnant.  This will not hurt her or the babys.  You will want to build a nest box then and mark on the calendar that 31days from when they mated is when she is due.  Go to google and look some of this up so you are prepared|`|NQq8i7gsaa	well you can't be sure it was a "successful mating" but you can watch to see if the rabbit begins to bulge in the stomach which means it is pregnant. If this does happen you should seperate the female rabbit and male rabbit in two different cages because the female will want to be alone, and theres a chance that the male will attack the new babies. From then make sure the female is comfortable and can easily access food and water and then just let nature do its work. but if your concerned it wouldn't hurt to call the vet or take in the rabbit so they can test for pregnancy and instruct you more accordngly on your situation|`|NkIczELyaa	I don't have a rabbit, but my cat did the same thing, I would say she is expecting b/c of her mood swing, Like woman getting pregnant have mood swings, I would say she is expecting, give it a couple more weeks and see if you and feel a difference in her stomach i don't think you would feel the little babies moving around that soon, however, i think you should be able to tell a difference in the feel of her stomach, This is just from my personal experience, nothing i looked up LOL Hope it helps tho|`|rpjnAhIIaa	I Would recommend that you take your pets to the vet. or phone them up and tell them what's been going on over the phone, the vets will definitely have the answer for u.
8i90ov0Gaa	My first snake was a ribbon snake, and honestly, they aren't the greatest snake for beginners. They are often aggressive, they tend to musk you when handled, and they make a mess of their cage. They have a high metabolism and crap everywhere. A corn snake can be fed frozen/thawed mice, so you don't have to kill any live ones.|`|80vFuZrqaa	my brother just got his first snake it was a corn snake, they seem really easy to take care of and you only have to feed them once a week so try one of them and there not aggressive|`|jTeDpBjlaa	First of all, I want to commend you for doing your research BEFORE getting your snake! (So many people do this backwards).<br>  <br>  FYI, buying frozen mice and thawing them is MUCH easier than having to deal with a live mouse (in case you decide to switch to the cornsnake idea).<br>  <br>  Ribbon snakes are very difficult to handle. (Go to your local pet shop and ask someone if you can hold one, so you can see how difficult that can be).<br>  <br>  It is fun to watch them "bob" for fish! You just throw some feeder fish into a bowl of water and watch them aim and "fire" into the water.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure that they can live 100% from a diet of fish. They probably do need the occasional mouse, as well, for complete nutrition.<br>  <br>  From: <a href="http://www.wnyherp.org/care-sheets/snakes/garter-ribbon-snake.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.wnyherp.org/care-sheets/snake...</a> "These snakes eat a varied diet. Items such as earthworms, red worms, and other insects will usually be readily accepted. Fish such as guppies, sand eels and Lance fish can also be provided in the pool. An exclusive diet of just fish is not nutritionally complete and should be fed with other prey items such as earthworms. Many specimens can also be converted to appropriate sized mice."|`|2qgg2G8kaa	Since you are just starting to get involved with snakes, I recommend you get a different snake for your first. Corn snakes and ball pythons are always a great choice. They are very docile and aren't the nippy type of snake. They love being handled and most are great eaters. I would say to get one of those snakes but if you really want a ribbon snake you could get one. I was just giving you an idea of another snake that would be great for a starter. E mail me if you have any questions about the snakes I mentioned and I will be glad to answer them. :)|`|wMjFfsnSaa	I reccomend a Ball Python or Corn Snake (as previously stated). Get some experience under your belt before tackling a more difficult species.|`|GOypfDoqaa	You put the fish in their large water dish that they should have, but I usualy fed mine by hand and she seemed to like that.<br>  Abagail<br>  Elvis
2YIxnXXyaa	Depending on their care, most of them live to be about 75-100 and at about 20 or so inches.<br>  here's a good site to learn more<br>  <a href="http://www.centralpets.com/animals/reptiles/tortoises/tor2604.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.centralpets.com/animals/repti...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  if you're looking for a smaller one, get a russian, greek or a hermans.<br>  but they'll all live to be about 75+ years of age.  some even 120+ years of age.<br>  <br>  hope that helped, good luck.|`|3AtR19kTaa	If they have been given the proper care and housing then about 70+ years. They grow to about 60+cm again if they have the proper care etc. In most cases they will need two people to carry them as they are so heavy!
9nFly3ulaa	Two, as long as you are ready for the immense amount of care and love that it requires.  I have Yorkies mixes and one is my baby, the other is my husbands doggy.  We we go to work they are each others comfort.|`|ZddQ0XHmaa	I would say one, just because you want to give that baby all the love and attention and not have to share it. It will be much easier to train one dog. There will be no territorial issues to deal with, unless of course, later in life you decide on another dog.|`|x2J2EQoBaa	it depends on if you are a first time dog owner and how many you think you can handle i would go with one|`|gjD8pndjaa	Only one, definitely.<br>  <br>  Once the other one is old (7+ years) and you think you want another one, you could try looking into one.  But you run the risk of severe behavioral problems when keeping two puppies together|`|z3QsWmzpaa	it depends like if your a first time dog owner coz if you are i would recommend one but if your not i would say two but thats only my opinion =]|`|pvm8wo9Waa	ONE!  If you get 2 puppies at the same time, you are in for much more than twice the work!  They won't be nearly as trainable because the other puppy is much more interesting than you are.  Whatever behaviors one develops, so will the other one. One will be a leader and the other a follower.  <br>  <br>  If you want 2 Yorkies, that is great -- get them at least one year apart.  Work on housetraining, grooming and obedience with the first one and then wait until you're sure you are very happy with that one's manners before adding the second puppy later.  That way your adult can teach your puppy good behaviors. Whatever issues your adult has may be taught to your puppy.|`|lDXh0jRVaa	Any responsible breeder will encourage you to take only one dog at a time. Otherwise the puppies will bond to each other instead of to you. Of course, they will still love you but they will be each other's best friends and will ignore you. Get one puppy, deal with all the puppy issues and then if you decide you want to go through it all again then go for it. <br>  <br>  Good for you for not breeding!|`|sQOXjKFNaa	I have had two females from the same litter. Sometimes you have double trouble. But the training was much easier. They both were eager to out do the other. Ps Both were junior hunt titled and show champions.  Good luck in what ever you decide!|`|3da8818f1b538bab7d343b90171547c2aa	Try one first see how it goes. A new dog, any dog, is a lot of responsibility if you do it right.

91CX5jHaaa	No, you don't need a license, but you DO need to do all of the following:<br>  <br>  1. Contact a breed club for your breed. Ask for a mentor.<br>  2. STUDY the breed standard. Learn about dog anatomy and ask your mentor to<br>  clarify anything you don't understand.<br>  3. Learn what genetic faults and diseases run in your breed and test for any<br>  that can be tested for.<br>  4. Show your dog in conformation events to see if it is of the proper<br>  quality for breeding. Winning doesn't always mean a dog is breeding quality,<br>  but being around so many others that know your breed and will talk to you<br>  will do wonders for your self-education efforts!<br>  5. Study the past history of great dogs in your breed. You will see how your<br>  breed has improved and progressed since the beginning of the breed.<br>  6. Study the breed standard some more! ;-)<br>  7. Join any Yahoo groups about your breed.<br>  8. Live, dream and study your breed.<br>  9. Get a good book on canine reproduction, and educate yourself about the<br>  pitfalls, problems, and proud moments of breeding. Learn about the<br>  physiology of reproduction, such as heat cycles and venereal diseases in<br>  dogs, potential for problems specific to your breed, and what you need to<br>  expect at whelping.<br>  10. Remember that whelping (giving birth) can kill your female. Being used<br>  as a stud dog can encourage bad behaviors common in intact males such as<br>  territorial marking, aggression, and desire to roam from home.<br>  11. Prepare to be broke. Breeding properly is EXPENSIVE.<br>  12. Line up potential homes for any puppies you produce and write up a<br>  contract. Remember to include that you will be willing to take back your<br>  puppies at any time in their lives that they might need you. If you bring<br>  life into this world, it is your responsibility FOREVER.<br>  13. Prepare to spend sleepless nights attending whelping females, caring for<br>  fading puppies or puppies orphaned, and practice cleaning up after 24/7 poop<br>  machines.<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are many things I missed because being a responsible breeder<br>  isn't just a job. It's a way of life. You will live dogs. 24/7/365. There<br>  are lots of hard decisions. There is a lot of expense. There will be pain.<br>  But, if you do your darndest to always keep the welfare of your dogs and the<br>  future of any of their offspring, you can go to step 14.<br>  <br>  14.

They are very easy to keep, very friendly. Check out the link for lots of info on them.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	Finches are not birds that want to come out of the cage, nor spend time with you, nor sit on your shoulder so if that's what you want, ignore that answer.  However, if you are even the least bit concerned about what the bird will cost, now may not be the time to get one.  If you had a bird before, you surely know the cost of the bird usually works out to be the least amount of money you must spend to get it a proper sized cage, proper toys and perches and the kind of diet it must have to stay healthy very long.  You also need to have money put aside for any sudden vet bills.  There is a saying, "if you can't afford the vet, you can't afford the pet" and that is never more true than with birds.  Your best bet is not to listen to anyone's suggestion as to the type you should get.  We don't know you, nor your situation, nor what you can afford, nor what kind of space you have for a cage.  Only you know that.  I'd urge you to do google searches on each type you think you might want, and find a couple message boards for those species.  Talk with folks who already have Love Birds or whatever and learn from them.  That's the best way to decide what is right for you and for your future bird.  Good luck to you with the decision.|`|0CSfFpFoaa	Id get a sun or green cheek conure<br>  They have just enough intelligence to be cute but not enough to dominate over you, plus there not toooo expensive.

They've always been able to come out of the cage and they become quite friendly and tame in a short period of time. They are small which is something you said you need and certainly less expensive than many of the birds already mentioned. They are also very quiet compared to many parrots or even budgies. They are very easy to keep and they will perch on you. The other birds mentioned are nice too and I'd have no problem with any of them, but anyone who says finches shouldn't be let out of the cage, either hasn't had much experience with finches or is just pulling remarks from between their back pockets.

KeevlZnTaa	I used to have gliders and they are very high maintenance pets. They take a lot of time, energy and money. They also have very specific needs to stay healthy.<br>  <br>  1)My gliders always peed on the side of the cage. They used to hang on the side of the cage and urinate, allowing the urine to drip down the side. When you clean the cage you need to be sure that you scrub down the sides of the cage well. I wouldn't say the urine got all over the walls, but it did get on the table I used to keep the on some times. <br>  <br>  2)I have not personally used these websites, but they do have cages on wheels.<br>  <a href="http://www.exoticnutrition.com/SUGAR%20GLIDER%20CAGES%202.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.exoticnutrition.com/SUGAR%20G...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sugar-glider-store.com/brisbane-cage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sugar-glider-store.com/brisba...</a><br>  <br>  3)I have never purchased from Pocket Pets and never would. I listened to their spiel at a mall a few months back and was disgusted by their claims. They are obviously in it for the $$$ and are willing to lie in order to get people to buy a glider. They tell unsuspecting people that gliders are easy to care for an inexpensive in order to get people to buy from them. While most breeders want you to think about the purchase, they actually told people to walk around the mall with their flier and then buy a glider(as if a one page bias flier, and a 15 min walk is enough time to make that kind of decision).<br>  <br>  I read through their website and they are misleading. Any "breeder" that tells customers not to do research with any other source but them, has something to hide, and that something is the fact they are lying and most other places give the exact opposite info they do. They try to convince potential customers that all contradicting info is false and dangerous, and they are the only experts on gliders(I suppose all vets, zoos, etc then are wrong also in their opinion). They are liars, plain and simple. It is a shame to think that they probably "scammed" a lot of people into getting a pet they are not ready for.<br>  <br>  They sell a cage that is too small, and tell prospective owners that the cage should not be large(which is a lie). They know people will not want to get a pet that requires a large and expensive cage.<br>  <br>  They also claim that feeding is easy and they only need pellets. Most reputable places advise against pellet diets as it causes lumpy jaw. Again they know most people will not want to feed a complicated diet, and would rather drop pellets in a bowl.<br>  <br>  Also, they charge twice as much for their gliders as real breeders do. A real breeder charges about 125-150 for a standard gray glider, where they were charging around 450 for a small cage(not big enough for a glider), glider, and a small bag of pellets.<br>  <br>  I would defiantly advise looking somewhere else for a glider. I personally think they are disgusting in their sales tactics. There is on thing to want to make a buck, but to dupe unsuspecting people into spending a lot of money without the right info is wrong.<br>  <br>  A real breeder will properly prepare you for glider ownership, and I advise doing as much research from numerous different sources. You cannot rely on one source of info as right, so be sure you check different websites, talk to glider owners and actual breeders, read books, talk to vets, etc. Get as much info as you can.|`|NezRCqdNaa	1. Yes, they pee everywhere and on everything. Males more than females. They will poop everywhere too. There's really no stopping it.<br>  2. Exotic pet stores and commercial stores like PetCo and PetSmart have a variety of cages that will be appropriate. I assume if you want one on wheels that means it will be fairly large. Mine is on wheels, two stories, about 5 feet tall. It was $300ish from a PetLand in TX. That's about the best deal I could find. But I had to alter b/c even though the bars were only spaced an inch apart, my glider could still squeeze through.<br>  3. Always try to buy from a licensed breeder or an exotic pet store that is well reviewed, and owned by trustworthy and passionate people.<br>  <br>  P.S. Sugar gliders ARE high maintenance. When people ask me about owning one I tell them it's like having a child. Seriously.

This must be her first heat cycle if you are asking, so she is about how old, around a year? so she is not at all too old to be spayed. Dogs can handle anesthesia at almost any age, just like people.

Avoid gouramis (they are of the same family as bettas and males will fight just like other male bettas will).  Try swordtails.  They're peaceful and like the same water type as bettas and are good pets.  Have a ratio of one male for every three female swordtails.  And cycle the ten gallon before adding fish (google fishless cycling).|`|JxbAC4D3aa	get him a couple of zebra danios. The petland by my house has them for $.65 and they are easy to keep.

And every dog breeder knows it (controversy from the "pet" crowd? maybe)<br>  <br>  the winning Saluki and the group winning poodle both were from frozen semen. Seems that frozen semen Or just AI and its impact would be topic to focus on.....|`|1WmDOPGtaa	Ooh, I really like panache's idea about the winner influencing trends in pet buying.  Almost makes me wish it was my assignment.  I don't have any good suggestions of my own, so I'll just second that one.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	There is quiet a controversy about the age of the winning dog since he is too old to be a stud any more and the real reason behind dog shows is to showcase breeding stock.|`|SXfWmOYHaa	I've always been interested to know why the poodles win so many times...haha.
eDySIDPQaa	Yes the dog can benefit from it, and so can your dogs as well, for having the company around for a brief time.<br>  <br>  Some fosters need more time in foster homes, they do not do well going from one home to the next, that is why most dogs that do finally get adopted out, are not use to long term and some have hard times adjusting to stay with that family,.<br>  <br>  Short term fostering is good, I also in my opinion gives the dogs more interaction with different types of dogs, and just get use to one family till the long term adoption is done.<br>  <br>  Benefit from it, for sure they do....<br>  <br>  You can do it, you have a heart of gold PP, and it is great you are doing this, you can show the dogs love and caring, they will respond to you for sure.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Of socialization for the foster owner's dog? <br>  <br>  My dog loves having short term house guests.  It's helped her a little bit, but not a ton.  It's allowed her to recognize her own kind and trust them more, so that part is good.  But, because we do purebred fostering for her same breed, it hasn't helped her with larger breeds or loud breeds.  <br>  <br>  But, we've also fostered highly dominant dogs that scared her.  <br>  <br>  We are thinking about fostering some other small breeds that we know she gets along with to create a little more variety in her life and maybe to get her to be a little better with other dogs out in the open.  <br>  <br>  My dog is a princess and loves being an only dog, so dogs that crave another dog as a companion may get overly attached in that 2 week span, creating issues.  <br>  <br>  In short, yes, it can be helpful, but only if the other dog isn't so dominant or aggressive that it set your personal dog back and if your dog won't get overly attached. <br>  <br>  Great Question!|`|mwVCFlLTaa	But which is the chicken and which is the egg?  People who foster are usually people who already understand the benefits of good socialization, and people with dogs who have issues are less likely to foster.  I stopped fostering when I realized how much it was stressing one of my own dogs (who came to me as an adult with tons of issues) even though he was very social.  The constant changing of dogs with their different personalities and issues can be very stressful for dogs who have high needs for stability and routine.  Its not my intention to discourage anyone from fostering, but I do think we need to be realistic about what we are expecting from our dogs.  And I think it makes a difference what breed/mix and personality the "home" dogs are- more gregarious breeds like beagles and labs may be more likely to adapt well to this type of situation than Border Collies and other brainy, often worried breeds.<br>  <br>  So does having fosters in help the "home" dogs be better adjusted?  I don't know that we can really make that call, though its certainly possible, and I think dependent on a number of factors.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Depends- some dogs crave and love other canine company and may get attached in a 2 week period which is a cause for concern.<br>  <br>  Some dogs love being the only dog in the house, but also *likes* other dogs for short periods of time.<br>  <br>  Honestly you cannot say that for every dog. It varies from dog to dog.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	In my experience, two weeks is the minimum time needed to affect  behavior changes in a foster dog who has issues.  A month would be better.  I consider socialization one of the primary purposes of fostering.<br>  <br>  I usually have two foster dogs at one time, but I do not bring them in at the same time.  I bring the second one in after I have had the first for at least two weeks.<br>  <br>  You are talking about putting the dog back into a non-foster situation after the two weeks?  I dont think I could do that....it is too disruptive for the dog, and I would be concerned that he would revert.  I would rather do some kind of visiting training/socialization in his existing environment than bounce him around.<br>  ********<br>  Now I am reading other responses, and thinking I misunderstood the question :o)<br>  Are you talking about fostering a dog in order to socialize your OWN dog?  If that is the case, then I would say no.<br>  I think a foster dog needs to come into a situation where the other dogs in the household already know the rules, and are well socialized role models.  My dogs are my best helpers when dealing with a problem foster dog.|`|7Rp256IOaa	Yes, foster homes do have well socialized dogs, but they are that way not because of the foster dogs, but because the owners have made a point to have them socialized right form the start.   Having foster dogs come into the home on a regular basis could be good for your dogs, or stressful.  Remember, these foster dogs have lacked socialization and will have issues.  Your own dogs may become stressed at having to defend themselves against these dogs if not properly managed.  I don't mean against fights, but just teaching the other dog manners and such.  It takes a saint of a dog to tolerate these special cases.  Just food for thought.|`|dl1OOOT8aa	I actually think that frequent foster parents are just generally more knowledgeable/experienced with dogs and thus have well trained pooches who can handle these somewhat stressful situations. I might be biased though, being a foster owner myself! lol<br>  <br>  But when I get a dog only for a week or so, I usually keep him/her isolated away from my other dogs. Especially if the history of the dog is unknown on dog aggression issues. Some dogs cannot handle this much changing as well. I've noticed that some of the dogs who were known to be overly protective toward the owner learn to be more acceptable and tolerant of people. But it really depends on the nerves of the dogs.|`|SXfWmOYHaa	I am a dog foster mom and I agree.  I think the socialization is great for your regular dog.  Raven (my chocolate lab/pointer mix) is wonderful around dogs.  But then again, she started as a foster puppy, too -- and I couldn't give her up.  It's great for the foster puppies as well since some come from bad situations where they weren't properly socialized or worse.  I think it helps them know that other animals are okay and builds a better level of trust within the animal.|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	The resident pets would definately benifit from the constant interaction, but if the foster dogs are switched around too much, i am afraid that they might never be able to really settle down, and may develop separation anxiety issues.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	I suppose that is an acceptable way.<br>  make sure there are other ways as well though<br>  <br>  I commend you for being able to foster. I'm not sure we could emotionally handle that in my home
oT71QN8Raa	"Dance!"  I taught mine to dance when they want food.  It took like five minutes - cats naturally sit up for food they want, so I decided to take it a step further and teach them to twirl at the same time - on command.

This usually works if your cat is upstairs or downstairs and you scream your cats name in a high pitched voice. My cat automaticaly comes when I scream 'MEATYYY!!!" (her name is mindy).

iUXnCGPPaa	I've used a couple tricks. First you can get Lysol Disinfecting Wipes..those work well. Also, if you have a rather large sink in your house, or even a stand up shower stall.... just use hot, soapy water with some rubber gloves on.. that's probably the best way to keep it the cleanest. Also, you can line the bottom of the cage with a garbage bag that's been cut open, then put the shavings over top..that way it keeps the "brown guck" off of the plastic and clean up is easier.|`|11PAFD9Caa	I have seen cage liners for sale at Petco/Petsmart.<br>  <br>  That helps a lot!

Just my opinion though.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	The semi-private board or whatever it was called sounds pretty decent. It is spendy but worth it. If you can board cheaper at your other barn and it costs about the same to drive there (compared to what you would be spending), then why not stay where you are? 2-3 horses per paddock is very nice compared to more. Trying to catch your horse is a "herd situation" isnt fun but it is doable. Its really up to you but, if you really like where you are, there really isnt a reason to change. Im sort of in the same situation but the two barns where I would possibly be moving are really terrible in service and quality so, my barn would be worth the extra drive. My horses are the only two in their paddock and if I moved, they wouldnt be. Hope this helps and best of luck choosing!

You'll find different prices. (If you hang around until the end of the last day of the show, you might find breeders/sellers willing to give larger discounts... MAYBE even as cheap as $10/snake).<br>  <br>  More importantly, consider the price of cages and cage set-ups.|`|P0FKlVRGaa	go to a local pet store and see the price cause it matters what kind theres about 17 different corn snakes and if its 30 bucks each one well u could get 4 <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   hope i helped|`|bOtk6QfIaa	It depends. A lot corn snakes r like around 20 buck or thats how much my friend got hers.So I think u could get like 4 if u feed them really good food.
jnzSz3tRaa	the tank mates should be fast swimmers and no fish with long appendages.  they will bother livebearers so don't match them up.  any fish that isn't big enough to eat it will be fine with them.  i would suggest sparkling gouramis, honey gouramis, neon tetras, white mountain minnows, things like that.|`|mQVmJdZvaa	any non aggressive tropical fish - just go to a tropical fish store and see what you like, make sure they aren't aggressive.

SgeIPqKlaa	it is common that a pup would do something like that. she probably was playing too rough and pulled a muscle! good luck!! :)|`|GSf09ALBaa	Could have pulled a muscle, ligament etc.  Puppies like to get into places they shouldn't and are not that agile at 8 weeks.  If anything, they are a bit clumsy.<br>  <br>  If she is still like this in the morning, ask your parents to make a vet appointment.|`|O6SBsgO8aa	How do you expect anyone to answer that with out seeing the dog.  It's like asking "why wont my car start " over the phone to a mechanic. It could be out of gas or have a blown motor.  Only an expert. aka vet, can tell you.|`|ILK3FlD1aa	it's unlikely the pup broke a bone (being 2 months old, and probably pretty light).  She most likely pulled a joint ligament.  this can happen any number of ways.  maybe she jumped from couch and snagged her foot on a blanket or something of that nature.  it should heal on its own within a week or two if that is the case, all the same it couldn't hurt to have a vet look at her.|`|QZEDisIsaa	That happened to my dog at 6 months, and she had lyme disease.  Take her to the vet and have them run some blood tests on her, if it is Lyme disease or something else they'll give you medication for her.  Or she may have jumped off of something and sprained her ankle.  Take her to the vet, Banfield vets at Petsmart are only $35.|`|w9pvYSikaa	Hmm that's odd, maybe she just jumped off of the couch or something and her ankle is a little sore.  If it persists then you should take her to be checked out by the vet.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|OPgXRcVvaa	well maybe when you were gone she ran around and maybe she fell.|`|a0EeYueWaa	Take her to the vet ASAP. she may have fell and is in deep pain. this is what vets are trained for, identifying problems like this.
Ghp39K4Kaa	For Q1, not for now.  IF, and only if, he and the mom squabble, or there are injuries, remove him.  Otherwise, don't.<br>  <br>  For Q2, just make sure she has water and food.  Don't handle her until the pups are around a week old.  The pups shouldn't be handled until they are around 2 weeks old.  If the mom has a problem with handling her or the pups,  wait a while.<br>  <br>  For Q3, no, she probably won't.  IF she does, don't worry.  This is natural.  This happens all the time in the wild.<br>  <br>  For Q4, no.  Not until the pups are about 10-14 days old.  You shouldn't disturb the mother like that.<br>  <br>  For Q5, find someone else who can take care of the pups when the get about 4 weeks.  If you want to keep them, get two LARGE cages and seperate the hamsters by gender.  Unless you want babies, of course.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hZLkzuuiaa	1) remove the male!!!!!<br>  2) leave her alone - don't handle her or the babies, just make sure she has plenty of food and water, and that it's easily accessible<br>  3)she may eat them, nothing you can do about it. Usually if a rodent eats the babies she can sense that they aren't going to live anyway. If she eats them, she will only eat the weakest ones. That's just nature's way.<br>  4) don't clean the cage - the mother will feel threatened<br>  5) main thing is to just let them be. when the babies are old enough to have open eyes and eat solid food instead of nursing (3 - 4 weeks) separate the males from the females or you will have more babies in no time!

N5tF9xjdaa	I'd go with rats.<br>  <br>  Although mice are cute, they also smell pretty bad and don't live as long. They also (depending on personality) don't like to be held and socialized as much.<br>  <br>  I'm a rat owner of two, and they seem to be the ideal small pet. If you can get over their appearance (some people have a problem with their tails-- not sure why) they are very very social and understanding, and live over twice the life of mice. (2-5 years)<br>  <br>  They are very clean and are great sweeties. But, maybe as a first rat owner you should get a male rat of about 5-8 months. Males are more calm and 'sluggish' and 5-8 months is still young, but they're very well socialized at that age.<br>  <br>  E-mail me if you have more questions.|`|0cEz1Hibaa	i say mice becuase when u bought 2 white ones for a project[maze] they were friendly and let me pick them up. Also a rat will bit harder, plus needs more food and|`|oGVWdnHraa	Yea mouse would let you hold and play with it if you handled it a lot, and it would be more than happy to ride around on your shoulder :)<br>  <br>  As for  the rats, they CAN NOT be housed on their own, or in a tank, on their own they can become very depressed, and a tank does not have good enough ventilation and can cause respiratory problems. They need to have 2 square ft minimum (thats each, so your cage should be a minimum of 4 square foot)<br>  <br>  :)|`|P4jy3w2Uaa	I have had MANY pet mice and rats. However I would suggest that you forgo the mouse option and get a rat.At the pet shop they will probably have many differrent sizes(based on their respective ages). The lager ,older rats they usually sell as 'feeder' rats(meaning they are usually sold to people who have snakes, for food.) But I have "rescued" a couple and they make wonderful pets also. It just depends. Rats are very intelligent.And yes you can train them to ride on your shoulder,etc. I kept mine in a wire cage that I made(about the size of a 20 gallon aquarium) ,which I think is easier to clean and doesn't stink as much and also lets them feel more freedom. After they have gotten used to their new environment, You can let them out of thier cage to roam free inthe house ,if you so like. My rats would actually come to their their name when I called them! Reward them with a little snack and put them back in till next time!Make sure that they always have something like a gnawing block to chew on so they can keep their teeth from growing back into their skull,and don't give them avocado because it is poisonous to them. Anyway, get a rat and not a mouse(they WILL run off the minute they get away from you!) and maybe another to keep it company down the road... GOOD LUCK! they REALLY are GREAT pets. My second choice would be a cat!LOL|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Mice aren't as social as rats, but are still friendly. It really depends on what you want. Mice will let you hold them and ride on your shoulder, but don't enjoy human company as much as rats. A rat can be kept in a 10 gallon if you have something called a tank topper. It's a wire level you can add to the top of the tank that will give them a place to climb (rats love climbing) and to help get ventilation. Just use a high quality litter such as carefresh or softsorbent this will help keep down the ammonia. A mouse wouldn't need that and could live fine in just a tank. The food is the same, lab blocks. If a mouse gets out, they are fast and hard to catch. You can train a rat to come to it's name or a special call. To do that, simply either call their name or make the sound and when they respond, give them a treat. Fairly quickly they will associate that with treats and come running.|`|aavUJmlOaa	Well, I would definitely say rats over mice. But you really need to get two rats unless you're at home a LOT and can hold it and let it run for long periods of time.<br>  <br>  A 10 gallon tank would be big enough for one, but it's really not ventilated well enough. If you get two, which is best, you'll also need a tank topper.<br>  <br>  And to whoever said mice because rats will bite harder, that is...I suppose true. But rats hardly ever bite. I've only had mine for about three weeks now, but they've never bit me. (Even though one of them is still a nervous wreck.) But mice bite a lot. I held one for about 5 seconds at Petsmart and it bit me to the point that it drew blood.<br>  <br>  So if you have the time and space for rats, I definitely suggest them over mice.|`|xB2wRYYBaa	aleast 2 rats, they are easier to care for than just one.<br>  <br>  and avoid a tank a much a possible, they really need to be able to breathe and climb.<br>  <br>  ive never had mice but i cant see how they can be as fun as rats in anyway.|`|k8h2kAd1aa	MICE

bI7wMCJXaa	WHAT?!!! We can't blame humans!! NO! People would never starve, beat and abuse dogs to make them aggressive!! People always make sure that Pit Bull type dogs and Rottweilers are bred with temperament in mind. They just go crazy because:<br>  <br>  1. They are genetically predispositioned to be bloodthirsty killers<br>  2. Their brains grow faster than their skulls and the pressure ultimately drives them crazy<br>  3. You always see Pit Bulls on the news, that means they must be vicious!!!<br>  <br>  I think you can cut through that sarcasm with a knife.<br>  <br>  Courtesy of moronic owners that have no business having any animal that can live outside of a glass bowl there are a wide variety of dog breeds that are "blacklisted" and assumed vicious based on breed. This is Pit Bull type dogs (Including the APBT, Amstaff, Bull Terriers and Staffordshire Bull Terriers), German Shepherd, Dalmations, Huskies, Malamutes, Chow Chows, and Cane Corso and similar type dogs, and Bull Mastiffs.<br>  <br>  In addition to the moronic owners you have media stereotypes. 68% of Pit Bull attacks are misreported, either intentionally for sensationalism or unintentionally because there are over 20 breeds of dogs that can be mistaken as Pit Bulls, including Boxers. My breeder I got my Amstaff from called the news when someone's Golden Retriever sent them to the hospital for 97 stitches. They weren't interested. When she called later to report her three Pit Bulls attacked her they were falling all over themselves to come get the story.<br>  <br>  Movies like Cujo (the book was a St. Bernard, the movie used a Rottweiler), Dark Knight (Rottweilers), Stand by Me (Dobermans) and many other films also gave the impression that these dogs are dangerous.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you realize that it's case-by-case and usually a product of ownership - look at all the Pit Bulls and Pit Bull type dogs Cesar Milan has in his pack. There are a LOT of Pit Bull rescues out there. In the mean time do your research and get personal experience with both these breeds. Trying to educate the ignorant about owners being responsible for their dog's behavior is like beating your head against a brick wall, but someone has to do it!!!<br>  <br>  P.S.- Pit Bulls do have the highest death rate per dog bite statistic, I think that's a CDC statistic but I'm not sure. They were NEVER bred to harm people until ignorant morons wanted to look "tough".|`|bPdqwkpPaa	I'm only prejudiced against them when I see unaltered dogs on choke chains running around that obviously are not worked or shown.  I am prejudge the owners as being morons and I prejudge the dogs as being unhealthy and having poor temperaments.  <br>  <br>  I love well bred examples of the breed.  The ones that are not giant blocks of disgustingly unproportioned muscle that are out of control and piece of trash owners who own & breed them to make up for their lack of sexual organs.|`|11PAFD9Caa	I love these breeds! <br>  <br>  I hope to have a Rottie or APBT with my family some day.|`|d98d8bfb68b616f97b22344613a67cebaa	Wrong...<br>  <br>  Dogs are also bred for specific tasks and as a result have dispositions and traits suited for the task for which they were bred.<br>  <br>  Pit bulls have been selectively bred since the 1800s for the purposes of fighting and continue to be bred for fighting today. US courts agree that the following breed characteristics of pit bulls are not in dispute: robust strength, unpredictability, tenaciousness (the refusal to give up a fight) and high pain tolerance.<br>  <br>  Understand any dog can bite at anytime. Treatment an animal experiences certainly contributes to the likely hood of biting behavior. (Fear biting for example)  However you won't have to search hard to find news reports of how the sweet family Pit Bull mauled a family member.<br>  <br>  The bite from a Pit Bull is devastating compared to most other dogs.  Resulting in a more traumatic wound, coupled with the breeds tenacity and pain tolerance it makes it more difficult to get the dog to disengage.  <br>  <br>  If you were going to be bitten by a dog but could choose the type of dog to be bitten by...I don't think that you would place a Pit Bull near the top of your list...<br>  <br>  <br>  If you look at the stats for fatal dog bites,  Pit Bull's are responsible for over %50 of the dog bite fatalities for the past three years in a row.|`|A9sLvVDxaa	The breeds you mentioned and a few others are often used as security/attack dogs, pit fighting dogs and are used as the evil scary dog in movies, which doesn't help their image.<br>  <br>  I have known people with pitbulls, and some of them have been very well trained and were affectionate and friendly. It's not the dogs fault. It seems that most dogs have this inherent need to please, even if it means becoming vicious killers.<br>  <br>  It's very disturbing, but here in Wisconsin, more and more dog fighting rings are found and the dogs are filling up the shelters here. With long-term care they can be rehabilitated, but our communities don't have the resources. I think there should be more regulation...but I don't see how anyone could control how many dogs you own and breed.|`|SXfWmOYHaa	I love both breeds too.  They are amazing, protective and loyal animals.  Unfortunately, irresponsible owners have given these dogs really bad raps.  I feel awful for the people that own pitbulls in cities where that breed is getting banned.  Courts and lawmakers need to start holding the owners responsible and not the breeds.|`|O6SBsgO8aa	They have extrememly powerful bites. Especially the Pitters<br>  Put that with their size and they can (and have) killed people.<br>  Other dogs bite and release but APBT hang on. Causing horrible damage as they were bred for fighting.   And you are right, a dog may be man's best friend, but some people are a dog's worst enemy.  Those people should never own an animal.|`|ehy9D93Vaa	I often wonder the same thing...  My stepmother calls them "Baby eating dogs" because she thinks that if a young child is around them, the dog will eat the baby.  I think it is all in how the dog is raised and trained.  I have a friend that has a Pit and she is the nicest and lovable dog I have ever met.  I wanted to trade her for my dog, but my friend wouldn't go for it... she said that I could have one of her puppies though (she has been talking about breeding her).|`|SgeIPqKlaa	fighting is what they were bred for.  plus, all the pit bull and rott attack stories on the news don't exactly show the best of the breed. :(  they always show those types of dogs in movies as fierce guard dogs. that is what leads people to think they are so mean. they are actually really sweet if trained properly.  i wish people would realize that it is people that cause them to be that way!!!! IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT!!!|`|cY4vg9VAaa	Because people are a scared mass of sheep. We are goaded by the media to be afraid. How many pit bull attacks are in the news? Several. Now, how about an attack by a Chihuahua? I've not seen any. We are taught to fear and fear can breed prejudice. One bad apple is said to spoil the barrel. People only want to focus on the bad. And it's hard to have a breed in good lighting when you have idiots breeding them for violence. Plus, with a pit bull, violent traits are bred into them. It don't matter if this dog was  family dog for eight years, it has the potential to snap, and that's what people fear. If people would start breeding the aggression out through natural selection, the breed might stand a fighting chance. <br>  <br>  I too, have been raised with pits but cannot own one because my fiance and his family are scared of them. They don't want me to have a pit around their grandbabies and would call me irresponsible if I got one. But it's just fear that is fueling the prejudice. <br>  <br>  You love both breeds. Don't let people's fears stop you. If you are ready for the commitment and responsibility and training it takes to own a more dominant breed, then you would make a great, responsible owner.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I have spend 25 years trying to convince people what a wonderful breed Rotties are. That is one of the reasons I trained them to be Certified Therapy dogs that work with Autistic kids, Alzheimer's patients and people that have been attack or are afraid of dogs.<br>  <br>  There are always going to be the closed minded individuals that heard on the news about some Pitt or Rott or other "dangerous breed' attack. There brains stop before they access the situation.<br>  <br>  I agree with GOOD about movie interpretations, when The Omen movies came out people assumed that these dogs were the spawn of satan.  The whole "fiction" thing seemed to allude their comprehension.<br>  <br>  All we as owners can do, is to make sure our guys are the picture of a perfectly trained dog, and keep plugging away with education.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Yep, Mauve has a few good answers going.  Don't like the use of the word Pitters, though.<br>  <br>  Both breeds are strong.  Strong willed, strong bites, strong bodies.  I could go into an avalanche of material on the APBT and even some on the Rottweiler.  But right now, all I can say is any person who chooses to own either breed needs to do complete and thorough research knowing they are going to own one of the most powerful breeds of dogs known.  Therefore leaving that person with the optimum responsibility to obedience train and socialize their dog to the maximum.<br>  <br>  No person who has severe self esteem problems or is lacking in leadership qualities should own either one of these breeds.<br>  <br>  People become jaded against the breeds because of some of the ignorant, uneducated people that purchase them for an extension of their ego and to enpower themselves by using a dog when they cannot do it any other way.
V7AAba8Laa	$10 is an underestimate. <br>  <br>  Raising just one is not practical when you factor in time spent and the cost of feed.  You'll need to get a smaller feeder and waterer, lighting, bedding, starter feed and starter grit just to get your brood pen set up.  That's about $35 worth of supplies for the chick.<br>  <br>  There is about a 20% mortality rate raising chicks, meaning if you started with 10, you're going to probably lose 2 before they reach pullet or cockeral age.  And they don't do well on their own, so the odds of getting one chick and raising it into a healthy meat bird are not good.<br>  <br>  You can better justify the expense by either buying several juvenile birds (most meat breeds at pullet or cockeral age average about $3-5 per bird) and they are past the mortality rate.  They also don't require a brood pen and can be housed in a regular coop.  Cost of feed is about $12-14 per bag for a good quality layer feed (better feed = better growth, which is very important if you are trying to raise up meat birds).  Meat birds eat ALOT, so expect 6-10 birds to go through a 50-lb. bag every couple of weeks easily.  <br>  <br>  Most meat birds are ready for slaugter by about 4-6 months of age for broilers, and slightly longer for standard breeds.   You can keep feed costs down if you pasture or free range birds during warmer months, but raising meat birds (even just a couple) will cost more than $10.<br>  <br>  However, the benefit of raising your own meat animals means you don't have to worry about growth hormones or antibiotics being used, and you can guarantee that the birds live happy lives and are humanely slaughtered.  Much better than the conditions store-bought chickens are raised in and much healthier meat for you in the end.|`|gB79Q9abaa	Awl! Just buy some chicken, don't eat the poor thing! :(|`|DBUmR8FTaa	Just buy some chicken. I couldn't raise one and eat it myself|`|AA11253664	like 10 dollars.|`|0rpN2419aa	Chicken food is going to cost you more than it would to cost to buy ready butchered chicken..probably 10 or 12 dollars.

QxIhMHwAaa	The reason she may not want to go on your hand anymore is the fact that you're "dropping" your hand to try to get her to fly. It doesn't matter if you're doing it gently or not. Birds don't like being on unstable surfaces. You've completely lost her trust by scaring her every time you do that, which is making her not want to sit on your hand anymore. <br>  <br>  Why do you want her to fly? Yes it is good if birds can fly to get away from predators and other dangerous situations or for exercise, but you shouldn't force them to fly if they don't want to. Yours may simply not feel the need to. If your bird is 3 and still isn't into flying, chances are that is not going to change much. Then again, are your bird's wings clipped? If they are clipped, or not fully grown out yet, she'll be much more uncomfortable with flying until she gets the hang of it. Just don't force her. With fully grown wings, however, you must be extra careful about doors and windows being closed. When birds get frightened and fly they have no thoughts about where they are, but just that they need to escape. <br>  <br>  My green cheek is almost 2. She started out only flying to me when I walked away from her. But she's learned to 'entertain' herself now and play with her toys when I'm not around. The only time she flies is when I get home from work and let her out to 'work off' the energy she's saved up being in her cage all day. She'll take about 3 or 4 circles around the room, then land on me and be done with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit to Add:<br>  Her diet sounds good except for the seeds. Is your bird a "seed junkie?" Seed should be given in moderation or as treats. You may want to consider converting her over to a pelleted diet, along with maintaining a wide variety of healthy veggies and fruits. <br>  <br>  If you are concerned about her weight, bring her to a vet for a well-bird check up. They'll weigh her and give you suggestions for the optimal diet/exercise. Remember though, birds have extremely high metabolisms...they can burn off that energy much more quickly than humans!|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	One thing to add to all the other answers. Is your bird over weight? If so it's harder for them and sometimes they just don't want to if they are over weight. I know my friend has a quaker and he will not fly either... he is WAY over weight. <a href="http://parrotcentral.net/" rel="nofollow">http://parrotcentral.net/</a>|`|xJNxXPbZaa	she don't like u cause ur dropping her and why would u want her to fly?<br>  i got my amazon and she only flew once and that time she flew away. lost her for 3 days i got really lucky i found her, since she has never tried to fly|`|wF52XMxAaa	There are a couple possibilities.  <br>  <br>  She may have been clipped before she got good at flying.  If she's bad at it, she may not be comfortable with it.  <br>  <br>  Or she may fly just fine, but just not care for it that much.  Walking or climbing is less work, and being carried by people is less work plus the fun of manipulating people.  Some birds enjoy flying and some don't; much like some people like going out for a 3 mile walk or run each morning and some don't.  Flying is good exercise, but if she doesn't want to fly, you really can't force her to and shouldn't try.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  > I've tried to drop my hand gently when she's on it to fly <br>  > but nothing works... before I could put my hand in and <br>  > she'd hop on, now, she hurries away from my hand<br>  <br>  You "drop your hand" and she doesn't want to get on it any more.  Think there might be a connection there?<br>  <br>  re: Add.<br>  Is your bird fat, or are you just worried about it?  If you can't tell, see an avian vet and find out how.  If she is fat, you might try changing her diet.
AMyZvgcVaa	He was probably eating flies off her hair. If it's a bold spot now then the flies ate away her hair and you should get cream for that!! Good Luck!!!|`|meMF69tXaa	You have the sniffing and marking, the circling, the chasing and copulation and yes, bucks can do what you have described. I hope you haven't put her with another buck prior to putting her with the current buck because that can cause him to have the type of behavior that he is having, too.<br>  <br>  You should put your doe in your bucks cage because she will be very territorial in hers.|`|r73XjKDNaa	Well, stay calm. He is just trying to get her to cooperate. Was he actually eating it or just pulling it out? But your suppose to take the doe back out right after the buck is done because if you leave them together too long the will fight so that could also have been a sign that he didn't want her in there anymore. Once you see that pull the fur from his mouth so he doesn't get a hairball.<br>  Good Luck!|`|ikTT4GkHaa	I know this isn't the answer but Uoof, my buck is doing the SAME thing while Thymine, my doe is running away grunting and like moments before they were laying together nicely and peacefully. So i think this is a very good question. <br>  <br>  In my view i guess its common to make a nest out of the fur he pull out...<br>  but im not sure|`|ggilREqfaa	You need to put the female in the males cage because the girl gets very territorial.
OrvTG44laa	No.  They have a different amount of chromosomes, so they can not breed.  The hamster is also going to kill the mouse.  Hamsters are solitary and are territorial animals.  They don't like other animals, especially of another species in their space.  Separate them quickly, or one of them is going to end up dead.|`|DBUmR8FTaa	no it is not posable|`|mOnMO2mXaa	No, they are different species. They are not special like lions and tigers or horses and donkeys unfortunately. I would probably own a couple if they could...|`|ikTT4GkHaa	haha, i wish<br>  it would be extremely cool<br>  but sadly no because they are different types of rodent
lYOy3I5qaa	Awwwwwwwwwww, thats so sad. You should keep all the windows in your house closed when they are flying around. Remember all your birds saw was him fly into the bathroom and never come back. :( Ok thats a little dramatic but you know what i mean! Birds have a great bond with each other if they have lived together. You will have to completely gain your birds trust again from the start. Good Luck! <br>  WINDOWS CLOSED!! LOL|`|VXdW4Lpwaa	i used to have parakeets, the way i got them used my fingers, was to just get them used to me.  I used to show them my hands outside the cage, they used to freak out but got used to that.  Then i slowly started putting my hands inside the cage, they freaked out, but then soon got used to that.  Until eventually having my hands in the cage as not a big deal at all, and they eventually walked on my finger when i placed some treats where my pointer and thumb met.
ICCP8m26aa	Lots. It might be. . . <br>  <br>  o Depression<br>  o Aging<br>  o Ripping her hair out<br>  o Fights with other hamster<br>  <br>  Not that much but that's all I could think of. Depression that the other hamster died...?|`|IVPpgkLBaa	She is getting a tad on the older side, so i have never had this happen but people lose hair so hamsters could possibly lose hair, Or it could be depression and she is ripping her hair out.
V483nKaeaa	I wouldn't trust someone you don't know. Ask a neighbor or family member. I say like 20$ a day is good.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	I would not be able to do that because my dog would never allow a stranger in my house without me there.  My vet says it's better to board at a reputable boarding facility because your dog is less likely to be able to run off and search for you and they know what to do in case of emergency.|`|DBUmR8FTaa	Do you have a close neighbor or friend you trust. Personally I would rather take my pet with me or broad it at the vets.Pet sitters are good they are payed professionals or someone who just loves dogs. I have been one. I can't remember what I charged. It was cheaper than boarding at a vet.I was reliable. Neighbors or friends you are not sure if you can always trust them to take good care of your dog. I have had some not do so well. It depends on how much you trust them. Just make sure who you pick is responsible. Ask other pet owners in your area what they do. You can get a pet sitter from ad or vets or friends. I would rather have family member I could trust.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	interview them. ask questions. fees should be 15 dollars and up a day.|`|SXfWmOYHaa	No, lots of people do it.  My friend had a company that provided tis service come and walk her spaniel once a day while she was at work.  Twice a day if she was going to be home late.  It was an established company, though, not just an individual.<br>  <br>  If you're going to find an individual (or even company for that matter)  to do it, make sure to thoroughly check them out and do a lot of research, just like you would if you were looking fora sitter for a child. I don't trust anyone with my pets except my mom or aunt when I go away, but that's probably just me.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	ask a friend|`|bPdqwkpPaa	I trade with another friend with a small dog.  When they are gone, we watch their dog.  When we are gone, they watch ours. <br>  <br>  You can also look into yahoo groups and meetup.com to find dog playdate groups.  Meet people there who might be interested in sitting. <br>  <br>  If he's a purebred, you can also contact a purebred rescue group for your breed to see if anyone is interested there.  <br>  <br>  Aside from that, I use ads and the internet to find professional experienced insured people trained in pet first aid.  Thanks to the resources above, my dog has only been at a sitter's house twice.  Both took extensive research and a visit to the facility to ensure it was what I wanted.
I38WF5aFaa	Leave it there.  It won't last until morning before a fox or other predator eats it.  That's how wildlife works.|`|AA11906603	You should put on some oven mitts, pick him up gently and put him in a box for the night or a cat carrier with a soft blanket. In the morning someone should take him to a wildlife rehabber. I'll post a Website where you can search for a rehabber near you.  Do not give the squirrel any water or food tonight.  Here is the Website to search for rehabbers by state: <a href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/%7Edevo0028/contact.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tc.umn.edu/%7Edevo0028/contac...</a>|`|DBUmR8FTaa	Is there a wildlife group around you.call them. Don't try to pick it up. it is hurt and scared and will bite.
v4vyq9Thaa	Jackson chameleons are really cool pets. They are the hardiest of all chameleons and they stay pretty small. They are slow and don't usually escape. They need a taller cage, usually made of screen but it can be made of glass. They need lots of plants to climb on and a source of humidity. Also it will need and day and night heat lamp. They are really interesting to watch when they eat and eventually you can even get them to take crickets straight out of your hand. I had one for a while and it was the coolest pet I've ever had.<br>  <br>  Here's a care sheet if you are interested:<br>  <a href="http://www.calzoo.com/html/jacksonschameleons.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.calzoo.com/html/jacksonschame...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|OUpJU2claa	if its a friendly social reptile you are looking for, you cant get anything better than an argentine tegu. they actually enjoy, and seek out attention, they will get a good size, but are so worth it! plus they have a varied diet so grocery store food, is a convenient option. google them, you will be amazed. also check the "do tegus like attention" video on utube! good luck|`|e1iw8giLaa	Well if you want something a little faster and friendlier than a turtle or tortoise, you should get a Green anole or a House Gecko. A green Anole is a cool about 4-8 inch lizard. You should a female green anole though since it's lets aggressive then the male is.The Green Anole is one of the most commonly kept pet lizards. They are very easy to provide care and are excellent for beginner lizard keepers. A full life for a Green Anole will only be about 2 to 4 years. A house gecko is also an awesome pet. The House gecko is Impossibly fast, the House Gecko is a very small and common Gecko. It is also very easy to keep, and a good choice for beginners. House Geckos are normally yellowish-brown in color, and have a very granular appearance to their skin. Well good luck and god bless!!!!!!!|`|d19ea35205cd660a24bf63de535e5a19aa	I would get a pair of Collard Lizards or Angle Headed Dragons. Both are very friendly and active lizards (certainly more active than turtles and tortoises). They're quite interesting just because they're so unique and rare. They really aren't too high maintenance, don't require an extremely varied diet, and they don't have an long life span like Iguanas. I've seen some really cool looking enclosures from breeders that own pairs of them. If your into building enclosures, you can get really creative and just make it a fun project for yourself. They're tropical lizards (I think), so they don't require extremely hot temperatures. They're also pretty friendly and calm when it comes to handling, and that's always a good thing, right? They get bigger than Leopard Geckos when they're adults, but they're smaller than adult bearded dragons.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped you! I want to get Collard Lizards and Angel Headed Dragons someday myself.|`|X5Qzk78maa	white dumpy tree frogs are the best, i have two of them and they get pretty big so you can actually hold them, other tree frogs are much more of a challenge. there are tons of other types of geckos besides leopard gecko which are cool too. but to be honest if i were u and had a choice i would get a CHAMELEON! they are so amazing and very interesting.
ICCP8m26aa	Short-Haired Teddy Bear hamster probably. <br>  <br>  Teddy Bear hamsters come in long-haired and short-haired. Yours is a short-haired one. Don't worry about it. It's happened to me before. [=|`|DEVRgWodaa	The ""Scientific" term would be Syrian Hamster, but many people go by Teddy Bear hamster. There are many types and it also depends on the pet store. <br>  Its a Short Haired Teddy Bear I guess.|`|URntCINAaa	Teddy Bear is just a fancy name for the Syrian hamster. Pet stores have sort of clicked onto the idea that by naming them something cute they can not only sell more but wangle more money from you! <br>  <br>  What you have is a short haired Syrian (also often called the golden hamster.) You can also get Long Haired, Hairless, Satin (shiney long or short haired coat) and Rex (more of a curly coat, slightly more wirey and curled whiskers. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you both enjoy eachothers companionship!|`|rchaTSI9aa	Oh, don't worry about what the receipt says. Sometimes they put one breed on the receipt (even if it isn't what you bought), simply because it's the same price. I bought a black bear hamster about a month ago, but the receipt said panda bear. So your hammy is definitely a teddy bear. <br>  <br>  Have fun! ;)
7i8ZKUQZaa	she will run around meowing more then usual maybe trying to escape if you open a door for outside licking down there alot more when you pet her she hold her butt up not because your scratching her tail but because shes ready to mate|`|8da67ac25bf0b572bff8917067bcb303aa	She will want more attention and love than usual.  Also she will stick her butt up when you pet her.  She will also meow more and it's like a whine.
sWe0lThUaa	Have one of your good friends stop by each day for like 5 minutes and have her feed the bird|`|0rpN2419aa	Do you have a friend that you could take the bird to?  You could offer to pay a few dollars or do something nice in return....that would probably be my choice.  When we travel, we have my kids or grand kids come over to check on things or stay a night if they want.  Your bird would be lonely, but probably okay..just call a friend.|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Two and a half days shouldn't matter much but maybe your Mom would let you leave your pet with a friend for those days that you will be gone.|`|e747c2c4f42307a0319a41df54a314d0aa	if ur parents dont want neighbors coming into ur house,give him to a friend or neighbor to care for at their home.if he knocks over the water bowl early on,he's toast.|`|cU5tON0Raa	some pet stores board birds,see if a local pet store near yoiu will board your bird.youll have to pay for this though.|`|1omgPICKaa	Put it this way... even if you do come home and he is just fine, is it really worth the stress of not knowing? I hated it when I came home from holiday, not knowing if my birds were even still alive because sometimes the sitter did a shoddy job. The feeling alone is awful and not worth it.<br>  <br>  While it is easy enough to have enough food for 2 and a half days with an automatic feeder (or lots of food bowls), water may be another matter. Water can evaporate fast and what if he poops in it and contaminates it? Not to mention that he may get lonely. However, in 2 and a half days he probably -will- be fine but it is not really safe.<br>  <br>  I highly reccomend that you convince your parents to let a friend, neighbour, proffesional pet or bird sitter to look after him. A friend may even do it for free for such a short amount of time. Also let them know that it is important to call you if ANYTHING happens, so that you don't have to worry.<br>  <br>  You could convince your parents by organising someone to look after him yourself and explaining how it makes you feel. Maybe show them the answers here if you're comfortable doing so. Good luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To the person who gave me a thumbs down, would it be possible to message me the reason why? If you think I am giving out wrong information, I would appreciate knowing. Thank you. :)|`|o3nNm1iAaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Can you give your bird to your neighbors so they can watch him? He will be okay but he will miss you and will be very bored. Tell your parents that the bird will be happier cause he will get attention if you give him to a neighbor for the 2 and a 1/2 days. There won't be a big mess at your house because if you leave a lot of food and water in his food bowl then when you get home you are going to find a big mess. Your bird might jump into his food then food will fly every where. <br>  <br>  If you can't get your neighbors to watch your bird then put a lot of toys  in his cage so he won't be bored. I just have one question for you:<br>  <br>  Who will cover(with a warm blanket) your bird at night? Who will uncover him? <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|rUjUmXNjaa	your bird will be fine, about the water bowl for your bird, trust me that wont work because you have to change the water everyday because they get poop in it, I would go ahead and buy a water tube that attaches to the cage....<br>  or if you trust your neighbor that much ask your neighbor if he could pet sit for you...don't worry|`|WH4T2HnKaa	i understand your concern, im the same way. do you have a friend that could just come by? or maybe just let your neighbors do it and not tell your mom?  also you can leave the t.v on or the radio in their room and the sound is like your still there to them.|`|CID74pDTaa	If its just for a short period of time and you can't get any one to drop by,  just leave a radio on (my conure loves music) make sure its not too loud so he can still sleep. And your bird will be fine.|`|wLfxMb82aa	Why dont you bring it to a friends house? They can take care of it for a few days.|`|hNIof0lbaa	Should be ok for just a few days!!!|`|er6tQfsnaa	ask your mom to check on him|`|bmhT1IrTaa	when me and my sister left for a couple day trip, we had to leave her bunny back at home, she had the same relationship with her. when we got back daisy was really bad sick, and when we took her to the vet, they said that it was because we were gone and she had no attentoin, so i advise you to talk to your vet, it might be different for a bird but im not sure. if you think that you can rally trust your neighbor, i really think you should have them check on him\her. socialization is important in takeing care of an animal. show your mom this and mabey it will help change her mind. if not  find a friend, or leave the t.v. on or music. the sound might fool them for someone being in the house so they dont feel lonely<br>  <br>  hope everything goes well|`|kwHIpsTRaa	Well i have birds and i have left them for a while, its only 2 and a half days? i think thats fine.. if you give them food and water. but if you feel that bad about leaving them alone then you could try to convince your mom and tell her you really care about them over the days your gone. But i think its not that much time to need your neighbor, but its your choice. if they have a health problem or something im not sure, but if there perfectly healthy and have food and water then i think its fine. well my bird has had another bird with them for the days we were gone so im not so sure..but it should be fine for just that time, you should make it light in the room he/she is in and maybe leave the tv or radio on so they dont get lonely.|`|tHwK0gdFaa	If I were you, I would take the bird with the cage to the closest friend, and leave everything that she needs to take care of the bird. She doesn't need to play with it like all day long, just maybe checking on him once a wile, and talking with him. Your bird will be fine :)|`|JdtLTvRGaa	i think you should let the neighbours check ur bird once in a while, as long as ur friendly with them and u trust them. I dnt think the bird will die if u leave it on its on 4 only 2 days, but its betta to be on the safe side.|`|5HgTTHDwaa	your bird should be alright, it has the food and water, it's just going to be really bored.|`|GzkK7qafaa	take it for a vet or something were they take care of them.<br>  or just tell ur parents to let the neighbors take care of him.|`|i2OXvzruaa	he'll be fine if it's just for a couple of days   if it was for a week or more, i would be worried|`|lClLXMdbaa	ya|`|lz1Apx67aa	bring him to one of ur freinds house|`|BToc3zeeaa	Leaving plentiful amounts of food and water sounds like a great idea. Its good to be nervous about leaving your bird, because it shows you are an extremely compassionate owner. The best thing you can do is trust that your bird is strong enough to make it without you and shower it with affection when you come back. Allowing neighbors to enter your house to watch your bird may have several consequences (i.e. leaving the cage open, scaring your bird, etc.) and it may be better in this case just to leave it alone. Hope that helps.|`|T99QygpKaa	Remember that even though everything sounds glamourous the way people say "get this person or that person to look after the bird when you are gone" its not always as good as it seems.<br>  <br>  The reasons for that are:<br>  <br>  1. The bird might not be too familiar with the people that will look after it<br>  2. He might not "like" the people looking after him<br>  3. Separation anxiety could occure (also more commnly known as pining)<br>  4. They might not know exactly how to clean / take care of / look after the little guy.<br>  <br>  So choose who ever you want to look after the bird while you are gone Carefully. Pining is not impossible, its actually quite common in all animals. Incase you dont know what it is, its when animals long for their owners, or for another animal that has been taken away or died. And as a result of this, they stop eating and starve themselves to death because they dont see the point in living if their loved one is not around.<br>  <br>  Im not saying this will happen, im simply pointing out the fact that it could happen and it should try to be avioded at all costs, because a birds metabolism is very fast, and it could die within 48 hours if it hasnt eaten anything. Or it could get so dehydrated and starved, that by the time you get back, it might already be too late.<br>  <br>  But that all depends on how strong your bond with your bird is ofcourse. Birds also eat a moderate amount of food every day, so filling his food bowls up extra full, and water extra full will not solve the issue. He will mess it up because it is there for him to eat, and he does not know any better. Or he will throw the seeds out etc. All birds do that, especially indian ringnecks and lovebirds, african greys etc. It will also give a higher chance for bacteria to breed in the water from his poop and other germs getting into it, which could cause fungal and bacterial internal and external infections to the bird.<br>  <br>  My best advice to you would be to make sure that the bird has someone to check on him once in the morning, and once again at night to make sure that everything is ok. He will also probably get quite bored being there alone, so i suggest you leave the readio on for him to keep him entertained. Its quite a common ritual with most bird owners when they go away for a short period of time. It also makes the bird feel more secure with the voice of people around.<br>  <br>  I do NOT suggest that you take him to someone while you are gone. Moving or relocating is one of the most stressful times for any animal, and it wouldnt be fair on him. It would also give him the impression that you have abandoned him and left him with strangers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.. =]
nlMfJtxcaa	The dog should be crated only when you can't watch her. The crate doesn't train the dog, it only prevents accidents. You stil have to take the dog outside on a consistent schedule and praise when she goes where she's supposed to.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is: You crate a dog UNTIL it is housebroken. Not the other way around.|`|7Rp256IOaa	It sounds as if you are not 100% successful now with the crate training.  If the crate is clean consistently, and your dog is going outside when you take her, then you can start giving her some more freedom in the house.  The kitchen is a great place to start as its easy to clean up any messes that might happen.  As long as you have established a routine and stick with it, your dog should catch on pretty quick.  An occasional accident will happen here or there.  No worries, just clean it up and try again.  You can always go back to the crate if she doesn't seem to be getting it.|`|XXR1BcWuaa	......however long it takes|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Just the act of crating them isn't going to train them. You are crating them to keep them from having the chance to go in the house.. You also need to take them outside OFTEN.. Every hour so that she has tons of change to go, Don't go in til she does something and praise her when she does. Just by putting them in the crate.. you aren't housetraining.. It's a training aid.. Not the total answer<br>  <br>  You need to only crate her at night, when you go out and when you can't watch her.. Not 24/7 ...
nlMfJtxcaa	It's about the same concept. If she is 100% adversed to going on the tile than it should be ok.|`|AcvsnkKCaa	my dog is kinda house trained. whenever he peed or pooped in the house, we put him outside. he doesn't like that. then he learned if he goes outside at the right times, we won't have to put him outside. we also put my dog in the crate. <br>  p.s how old is your dog? if she's kinda not a young pup, then she can hold it in longer than a puppy. (mine's only a 5 month old pup.0
vbEkYH2haa	Good luck finding your answer, and i am sure you are beautiful not matter what you hair style. We spend far too much time fussing over the little things.

MzHwklzKaa	The female has to express all the eggs she's carrying.  If not, she'll get sick and maybe die.<br>  <br>  There's no real way to prevent lots of eggs.  Fish that aren't fed properly, or don't have correct water conditions won't produce many eggs, BUT they'll also be sickly.  BAD NEWS!<br>  <br>  This is an "all or nothing" sort of thing.  You have to expect around 300 baby bettas.  Do you know what you're going to do with all those babies?  Because most pet stores don't buy from local breeders.  <br>  <br>  This is a fantastic site.

They'd give them away on a spay/neuter contract with a small adoption fee to weed out the people who want to use them for fighting dog bait.  Of course, a RESPONSIBLE breeder would have done ALL this, and not allowed their dog to make mutts in the first place:<br>  <br>  1. Contact a breed club for your breed. Ask for a mentor.<br>  2. STUDY the breed standard. Learn about dog anatomy and ask your mentor to<br>  clarify anything you don't understand.<br>  3. Learn what genetic faults and diseases run in your breed and test for any<br>  that can be tested for.<br>  4. Show your dog in conformation events to see if it is of the proper<br>  quality for breeding. Winning doesn't always mean a dog is breeding quality,<br>  but being around so many others that know your breed and will talk to you<br>  will do wonders for your self-education efforts!<br>  5. Study the past history of great dogs in your breed. You will see how your<br>  breed has improved and progressed since the beginning of the breed.<br>  6. Study the breed standard some more! ;-)<br>  7. Join any Yahoo groups about your breed.<br>  8. Live, dream and study your breed.<br>  9. Get a good book on canine reproduction, and educate yourself about the<br>  pitfalls, problems, and proud moments of breeding. Learn about the<br>  physiology of reproduction, such as heat cycles and venereal diseases in<br>  dogs, potential for problems specific to your breed, and what you need to<br>  expect at whelping.<br>  10. Remember that whelping (giving birth) can kill your female. Being used<br>  as a stud dog can encourage bad behaviors common in intact males such as<br>  territorial marking, aggression, and desire to roam from home.<br>  11. Prepare to be broke. Breeding properly is EXPENSIVE.<br>  12. Line up potential homes for any puppies you produce and write up a<br>  contract. Remember to include that you will be willing to take back your<br>  puppies at any time in their lives that they might need you. If you bring<br>  life into this world, it is your responsibility FOREVER.<br>  13. Prepare to spend sleepless nights attending whelping females, caring for<br>  fading puppies or puppies orphaned, and practice cleaning up after 24/7 poop<br>  machines.<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are many things I missed because being a responsible breeder<br>  isn't just a job. It's a way of life. You will live dogs. 24/7/365. There<br>  are lots of hard decisions. There is a lot of expense. There will be pain.<br>  But, if you do your darndest to always keep the welfare of your dogs and the<br>  future of any of their offspring, you can go to step 14.<br>  <br>  14. Enjoy the love and success of a job well done.|`|fTQmn5V3aa	Spay your dogs. Now. Ask only enough for the puppies to cover the cost of their shots and screenings at the vet's office. Create a contract for the buyers insisting the pups will be spayed/neutered as soon as they are strong enough.<br>  <br>  Why were you so irresponsible as to let your dog get close to an unsuitable male when she was in season? Why were you wanting to breed in the first place? <br>  <br>  There is one, and only one, reason to breed: to improve the breed. Not to make money. A good, responsible breeder rarely comes out on the plus side of the ledger. She or he spends endless hours researching pedigrees and genetics, screening for luxating patellas, entropion, epilepsy, dysplasias, temperment, conformation, ability, and all the other qualities which will make a superior rat terrier. I know this because I used to breed rats myself. I still have two here at home - one is spayed, the other neutered because I no longer have the time or energy to do the job properly.|`|D1ZUnRuQaa	100 for an adoption fee is reasonable, and they are really cute!!!!! I had a foxhound who dallied with a poodle... Poo hounds, they were really cute too.|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	Yes, it would be fine to sell them, but just make sure that you do some screening of potential buyers to make sure the puppies go to a forever home.  Type up a simple contract for them to sign, saying that they will have the puppy "fixed" within a year, and that if they ever have to get rid of the dog, that they will offer him to you first before they try to leave him at the pound or something.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	What you have is a accidental hook up. Find loving homes and just charge for shots.<br>  Spay your dog so it doesn't happen again|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Just spay her AND her mother.  People can go to shelters to get mixed breed dogs.

Dont rip people off by trying to make a profit on them.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I would contact your local shelter and see what their adoption fee is - that should be the price to sell your puppies at. Please include a mandatory spay/neuter clause in a contract when you sell them so they don't produce any more pups. Any money you get should go towards spaying mom.<br>  <br>  Considering the falling economy, you'll be lucky to sell them (even as cute as they are.) A lot of people are having to give up their dogs and many won't want to buy (loss of jobs, higher expenses.)|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Do NOT sell her siblings.<br>  <br>  Price them ONLY at what you spend on their shots, which is roughly $75.00.<br>  <br>  Have the mother spayed.

NkIczELyaa	Its normal, and no she isn't in pain, my cat is in heat right now also, the only thing you can do is get her spayed or let her mate, altho that would mean you would have little ones running around eventually LOL|`|IRaIxWJKaa	You should hear a Siamese in heat. The neighbors called the cops on my friend five times because they thought she was abusing the cat.  She basically opened the door and waved the officers to the side window where the cat was 'singing' at the top of it's voice like a banshee.<br>  <br>  It's the mating call, loud and able to carry over distance so males can hear them.  And no, unfortunately there is nothing you can do to stop her, except for spaying her.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Please don't breed her.  There are dumpsters full of dead cats and kittens at shelters, they usually have a euthanization day where they just clean house and kill hundereds of them.  Its sad but the shelters are so overcrowded with all of the strays and people surrendering litters of kittens all the time.  I have a female ragdoll and when I adopted her, she was 3. She had never been spayed or anything.  Since she is strictly indoor I decided to give her a try with not getting spayed because she was already 3.  Bad idea!  This cat cried like your cat every other week at least.  She also was really skinny, 6 1/2 lbs. which includes all of that long fur!  She also didn't eat very much, maybe 5 bites of food then walk away.  After being spayed she has gained 6 lbs. and now weights 13 lbs. which is much healthier for a bigger cat like a ragdoll.  She doesn't cry and shes much happier.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	you're worried about her being in pain NOW, but you want her to go through the discomfort of carrying a bunch of babies, then the pain of giving birth, then the hassle of nursing/caring for a bunch of babies?<br>  doesn't make sense. and don't even give a thought about the pain of getting pregnant (you do know how boy cats are built right?).<br>  there's a reason why it's called "getting hooked" by a male.<br>  <br>  spaying will end all her problems and yours.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	You need to get her spayed, and please be very careful not to let her outside!<br>  <br>  Spaying/neutering not only prevents unwanted animals from being euthanized, but it helps your pet avoid future behavioral and health problems.

So a hamster cage on a table will probably be high enough. <br>  <br>  Does your dog like to chase rodents, like squirrels or rabbits when it goes outside? If so, a hamster may not be a good idea. I had a friend with a hamster that escaped frequently, so if your dog takes a liking to chasing rodents, you may want to reconsider. <br>  My dog loves chasing rodents but never bothered my guinea pigs. But hamsters are much smaller. If you don't know if your dog is a chaser, try testing her with a tennis ball or something. <br>  <br>  Another solution would be to keep your hamster in a room where the dog doesn't go, or a room that always has the door closed. This would keep the animals completely separate.|`|ZefydJ8Gaa	take her to a pet store and walk her by the hamster cages and see what she does<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309164204AAIfUGT">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|OrvTG44laa	Dogs and hamsters don't mix well in almost any situation.

8i90ov0Gaa	I wouldn't trust any one at a pet store to sex my snake, and most vets have little reptile knowledge. I would find a breeder to tell you. Babies are popped and adults are probed, and this should only be done by someone who knows what they're doing to avoid harming the snake. Some people think you can tell by looking at the tail, but this is not accurate. And Sean is backwards, the probe only goes in a little for females and for males, it goes in far.|`|EuJTvGkxaa	You have to get the snake probed. This means sticking a prob up the snakes cabuse and seeing how far up it goes. If it goes in far, female not far, male. If you have had your snake for more than like 6 years or so you can tell because females are about 2 feet longer fullgrown.|`|wMjFfsnSaa	I would take him to an experienced breeder. There are methods to determine the sex of the snake, but an amateur can injure the snake.|`|GXFLWjE4aa	Probing but I would not recommend it to someone who does not know how to do it so ya just take him/her to vet.|`|y3YHOZlaaa	You should take it to the vet, it's the only 100% method of finding out.

8i90ov0Gaa	Why? Snakes are solitary and prefer to be alone. They don't need company. The people who think it is okay are either beginners or are just too cheap to buy another enclosure. Housing more than one snake together can lead to stress, feeding problems, and if one is ill or has parasites, the other will probably as well. I have close to 200 snakes and keep all separate. And a 20 gallon is too small for 2 snakes.|`|jTeDpBjlaa	The 20 gallon tank is ok just long enough for you to go out and buy 2 larger tanks. <br>  <br>  Most of my snakes are in reptariums. Unfortunately, those are kind of difficult to clean.<br>  <br>  You can make your own snake cages using rubbermaid-style containers (google making snake cages). They are much easier to clean. (That's why I got away from glass tanks, I couldn't pick them up to clean them).|`|wMjFfsnSaa	That is an extremely risky situation. A twenty gallon is far too small for one, let alone two.

hbp3oBomaa	For most rabbits its about 6 to 7 months. at 6 months you may want to start mixing the two hays together, so by 7 months your bun will just be on timothy hay. At first my bun was not happy with his timothy hay but now he loves it, some buns may take a while to adjust and some will eat anything you put in front of them. Also pellet food, some people feed the young bunnies a pellet that is made for young buns, if you do it would be time to start switching as well. They can have other grasses too like orchard grass for example.|`|Idunjsxjaa	At 6 months a rabbit is fully mature.  My breeder told me to only feed my rabbit timothy hay because they get all the alfalfa they need from their pellets (even as babies).  Seeing as how your feeding alfalfa I would buy the timothy hay and mix it in the alfalfa and gradually increase the timothy hay and decrease the alfalfa until it's only timothy hay.  Good luck!
19fa39a2ed4e38229aee162e273509bcaa	no touch dont speak no eye contact...<br>  <br>  being with them is giving them attention already..<br>  <br>  or you might get them very very exited!!|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	The best thing to do is PREVENT the fighting in the first place. Start by making sure that neither dog gets any attention unless they have earned it. They can earn attention by sitting and behaving. If they nudge you or beg for attention, ignore them. If they show the least bit of aggression or guarding, ignore them. Until you get them under control, I'd keep them separated until you've had some time to work with them. <br>  Secondly, start practicing the Nothing in Life is Free Program. <a href="http://k9deb.com/nilif.htm" rel="nofollow">http://k9deb.com/nilif.htm</a> <br>  <a href="http://akbashclub.com/adaanilif.htm" rel="nofollow">http://akbashclub.com/adaanilif.htm</a><br>  It's a program that teaches dogs that you are the boss and helps them understand their place in the pack and it does it with simple changes that will keep them under control without harming your relationship. By controlling the resources as well as when your dogs get affection, they learn to see you as the leader and will quit competing for your affection. <br>  No dogs on furniture, no food or treats without earning it, no attention without earning it and plenty of exercise. <br>  If that doesn't help, seek a good trainer, but this is a great place to start.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Not easy.  What you are doing now is alpha rolling.  You seem to know how to do it but I don't think that is your answer.  Alpha rolling works well if you can hold both dogs in a submissive position until they both submit.  From experience, I have set on the floor for over 30 minutes waiting for that to happen.<br>  <br>  So, I would put the alpha rolling on the back burner.  I am assuming they are both males and neutered?  This is not an unusual occurrence even if they are both neutered or spayed if one is female.<br>  <br>  The trouble is, you are going to have to go at this problem from a different point of view.<br>  <br>  First, let me say I know where you are coming from.  I have an 8 month old APBT who is dog friendly BUT very jealous.  She is still learning she cannot own me or anybody else.  I am breaking up fights on a regular basis right now but I have help usually.  When I don't I have to take her to her kennel for time out.  She is bigger and stronger than my other dogs but has yet to draw blood.  In fact, SHE has gotten bitten by my Dachshunds!<br>  <br>  Anyway, I am going to suggest enlisting the help of a professional trainer.  You are by yourself with 2 large dogs and even though they are not aggressive towards you, they are capable of hurting each other and hurting you (not intentionally) in the process.<br>  <br>  Call in a trainer.  Get the best advice from the best on how to handle this.  And good luck.  You have your hands full!|`|FdcWPp48aa	They are fighting over you.  You need to learn their signals and not let it get so far that they begin to fight.  At the first sign of aggression you should walk away and refuse any attention to either.  You are their greatest resource and they are what is called "Resource Guarding".  If you refuse to give attention when they show the first sign of aggression, then they will learn it doesn't work.|`|XavY3fiWaa	When you pet them, if they start fighting just say in a loud clear tone "ehh ehh" then just get up and walk away, that way your showing them that when they fight over the attention they get no attention.  I hope that works, good luck.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Well, if they are not already neutered/spayed, start there.  Take them both to obedience training and resign yourself to the fact that they may have to always be separated.|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	I would keep them separated and show them affection individually.|`|9A76BM3Baa	When they start fighting throw cold water in there faces, they won't like that and will eventually stop.|`|7Rp256IOaa	They are vying for your attention.  For heaven's sake, please don't try and break up a dog fight!  As you found out, this is a good way to get hurt!  You need to manage your situtaion better.  If your dogs are unable to be in the same room together while you give one attention, then be sure to put one in a secure location while you pay attention to the other for now.  Then, work on an opposing behavior to the lunging at each other.  Down would be a good one.  A dog can't be launching himself in the air if he is in a down.  Taking the dogs by the collar and forcing them in a down position does nothing to solve the problem as you found out.  You should work on your dogs' ability to stay in one place on command.  Work the dogs individually at first to reduce the distractions and set them up for success.  Once you can have each dog performing basic obedience including a stay, then start working them together, rewarding as you go along.  Don't be stingy with the rewards.  Carry this over to feeding time and other opportunities.  Ask the dogs to stay in one place while you prepare their food.  Then release one at a time to their food.  This will further improve their impulse controll.  <br>  Now, you can start working on the two dogs getting your attention.  Start slowly, have the dogs a good distance from one another, say on either side of the room.  Put them in a stay.  Then walk over to one, praising him for staying in place. Do this calmly to start.  Then walk over to the other dog and praise him for not only staying but for tolerating you petting the other dog.  Slowly decrease the distance until the dogs are next to each other.  As you pet the one, reward the other for remaining calm.  You need to reward the good behavior.  If a fight does break out, you leave the room.  They are fighting over you so by leaving neither one gets your attention.|`|qg8wDrURaa	The Exact Same thing happens with my two dogs. The main thing is try not the pay any attention to then. When you try to break up the fight. It'll only get much worse. No Touching, No Eye Contact. If you don't feel comfortable doing that. Go to your local vet and ask him. Or a trainer. If they tell tell you to give one away or sell one or to even put one of the dogs to sleep. Don't listen to that. There's ALWAYS a solution! Visit the website below in my sorces. Hope I Helped.<br>  =)
8TUoi7Jiaa	Your rabbits cage should be big enough for him or her to make about 4-5 hops across; this way it has room to have a place for it's feces and room for it to sleep away from it.  They are clean animals and don't want to be near that. :-)|`|5TM9P8tsaa	*I would have gone with a 24 x 24 but your cage should be ok.
znGpjsGjaa	This is not a good sign. Is your rabbit a doe (female) or a buck (male)?<br>  It could be one of any number of diseases. it could be simple hutch burn, which is from a rabbit sitting in it's own urine and the urine burns the tender tissue in the area. It could be something very serious like vent disease which is actually rabbit syphilis. This needs to be treated with antibiotics. <br>  <br>  And for your info a rabbit genitals and rectum area should not be red.<br>  Does do not come into heat so that is not a cause of redness.<br>  Rabbits are induced ovulators which means they release the eggs when they mate with the buck and sperm is released.<br>  <br>  I would suggest if you only have one rabbit and it is an inside pet, take it to the vet and tell them it needs to be treated for either hutch burn (urine scald) or Vent disease.|`|0e51HkpHaa	Why are you looking at your rabbits butt?|`|DBUmR8FTaa	If the rabbit is unfixed it means it is in heat. Go on line and google it or ask your vet incase it is something more serious
xWNLHMMcaa	go to the aspca i think they do payment plans|`|0e51HkpHaa	Try a farm or feed store for animal antibiotics, dose by weight.|`|KILFoc6kaa	Most vets will accept payments call around and see what they can offer.  And you are right to be afraid of him getting very sick.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	You can also do an online search for feline rescues in your city, contact them and ask where a good low cost vet is.  They'll know all the places in your city.|`|YRJFo6K0aa	I trust that if you care about your cat as much as it sounds like you do, then you were probably in a more secure financial situation when you took on the responsibility of caring for him. Given the current economic situation, you are certainly not the only one in this position and know how desperate you must feel. But have hope: there are probably some options out there you haven't thought of yet.<br>  <br>  Please call your vet right away and ask what your options are. While it is not fair to expect them to treat an animal without payment (they have to pay for those expensive medicines, supplies, employees, etc. and support their own families) they should care about helping you find a way to treat your cat and can probably give you some suggestions. They may have a long-term payment or loan plan that you could manage, or know of an organization you could get one through. Show them that you are willing to do whatever it takes to get your cat treatment; ask questions about any option you think sounds promising, offer to work to pay off part of the money, just show how much you care. Even if their suggestions are difficult and require sacrifice and inconvenience on your part, express gratitude for any offers which might help you. If your own vet has nothing that can work with you, try other clinics in the area -and I would highly suggest calling a veterinary school in your area (or even elsewhere if there isn't one close) and ask them if they have any suggestions. They have a lot of experience with this sort of thing, and they may have some good ideas. <br>  <br>  Finally, and this is difficult to say: if you have exhausted all possibilities and your cat's health and happiness are in danger, please consider surrendering your cat to an animal shelter that you trust. They will have professional staff there with experience caring for sick and injured animals, access to veterinary care, and the potential for finding a home that can pay for veterinary care. I know you would be heartbroken to give up your dear cat, but if you must do this then you will have the comfort of knowing that you did the most loving and caring thing possible. <br>  <br>  Backtracking from worst-case scenarios, let's talk about what you can do for him right now. The most important thing to do is clean his injuries and try to prevent infection from setting in (and keep him indoors!). You can use warm water and gauze, then betadine iodine to clean the wounds. Wash out the puncture wound as well as possible, since this is most likely to lead to infection. Dab triple antibiotic ointment on the open wounds to help prevent infection. Does the cat seem to have any broken bones or internal injuries? They can hide pain pretty well, so even if you're not sure it's best to make sure he doesn't have to move around too much. Keep those wounds clean, and watch him for any sign that he's getting worse. Monitoring his temperature might be a good idea too. Normal temp is 101-102.5 Fahrenheit, and any higher than that could indicate a bad infection. <br>  <br>  If you have any more questions, please feel free to message me. I'll keep brainstorming and let you know if I come up with any more ideas. Good luck. You and your cat are in my prayers.|`|b9689fed9476cf1689313993794dc53eaa	A person in a group I belonged to gave this address:<a href="http://www.thepetfund.com/link.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepetfund.com/link.htm</a><br>  I'd say in the mean time wash as much blood of as you can and clean the area with betadine (near the bandaids in the drugstore).  If the other area is actually near the eye just use warm water to cleanse and then use antibiotic ointment.  Keep an eye on the leg it seems that when another cat bite deeply enough infection can set in quickly -so you may have to go to a farm store and give pennecillian.  you can find out online home to properly give IM injections.  I used it for my dogs, cats, ducks, and rabbits over the years.  Also my son when he had bronchitis and was little.   Just remember if an infection sets into his leg you willhave to possibly remove the scab to drain and treat the would.  Good luck..|`|rPF9klwTaa	my cat got into some cactus one time and we took her to the groomers and they got all of the cactus out for free. Maybe they would give you something for your cat if you took him there.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi here is what you can do at home.  Take and get a wash basin and put warm water and antibacterial soap in there..  You need to soak this leg 3 times a day for several days.  Soak the leg and foot for 15 min.  Then dry well and put antibacterial ointment on the wound.  On his eye use lukewarm water and Johnson and Johnson baby shampoo and cleanse eye, rinse well and leave alone as it will heal good.  But the leg and foot is going to be problems as he probably already has an abscess in there.  So soaking with what i told you should help.  But the cat is going to need antibiotics.  You could talk to a vet and ask them if there is any way they can give u some antibiotics for the wound as you can't afford to go there.  Also another thing you could do is to get some Penicillin from a farm and ranch store and make sure that it can be given to cats and dogs and give 1/4 cc  which would be .25 on the syringe.  This needs to be given in the neck with a short needle and intramuscular.  But it would be better if you go to vet, they do take payments.  Good luck!|`|7i8ZKUQZaa	get a phone book and call every animal shelter vets anything you can find if you cant afford it you may need to surrender him when my lilly was preg she fought with the dad and got a bite wound on her paw and i swelled up and i got meds from the vet they were around $5 for the med as for eye i wouldn't know if you cant afford the vet bills for an animal it would be best for him if you didn't have one and you shouldn't let them out side sorry about your cat and i hope you can get him the help he needs poor baby : (
Okrs9Qjfaa	How long has it been since you have first had to two together. A rabbits gestation is 28 to 32 days, most deliver on the 31st day. If her belly is bigger she is most likely pregnant. If you can, some does are really cranky, you can gently press on  her belly and see if you can feel babies. They should feel like like babies, many bumps, and some might move. If you aren't sure if she is pregnant I would still put a nesting box full of straw in her cage just to be on the safe side. I hope this helps and good luck.|`|ikTT4GkHaa	Oh Em Ge!<br>  After humping the heck out of each other on the first day they met, a day after Thymine is doing the SAME thing... except building a nest<br>  But she does grunt around him although at times she would sleep with him and clean him (Uoof) and through my research im saying that those are all signs of pregnancy although the only way to really be sure is to take her to the vet...<br>  I wish there was a pregnancy test for animals xD|`|DxVUnmZQaa	well if both are unneutered . most probably that its a postive . :D|`|9p7eUgYqaa	Yes shes pregnant.|`|aYjF2SOKaa	If your rabbit is pregnant, she will start nesting and pulling fur at around 26 days.<br>  <a href="http://www.thenaturetrail.com/Palpating-Rabbit-Does.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenaturetrail.com/Palpating-...</a><br>  Read this.<br>  And please have your rabbits neutered/spayed.

6CUEBlkfaa	i had a similar problem, and what i did was buy a cheap $14 ten gallon fish tank and buy a filter, which altogether cost about 25 dollars and i got some platys to acompany the betta. also try putting a cleaned out coffee cup for hiding space and a bristle nosed pleco in the tank, along with lots of plants <br>  <br>  ( i bought a reptile climbing plant for cheaper than fish tank plants :) ) <br>  <br>  that should help!|`|gCyliygXaa	ether petco or petsmart has a betta starter kit that comes with food, water salutation stuff and all that for about $10 ish. if you dont have a petco or petsmart then go back to where you got him and ask if they have any kind of starter kits for your betta.  if anything then try hitting yard sales for a fish boll or small, but not to small fish tanks. you can sometimes get really good deals at yard sales. just make sure you wash it really good.|`|TjLCnxkKaa	Well a fish tank is quite a common item found in many households.<br>  <br>   Bettas  live in vast paddy fields in the wild, but many confuse shallow with small. Despite the fact that many do keep their betta in small 1 gallon bowls they really thrive in larger tanks with gentle filtration, live plants and a temperature between 75 and 82 F. (heater).|`|YnCUyvK7aa	Your fish needs to have a reasonably sized tank [2.5 gallons minimum] and a heater.  A gentle filter is also good to have.  Bettas are tropical fish, so if you can't keep the water temperature 76-80 degrees, he won't eat, and will be more likely to get infections and die. <br>  <br>  I don't know what you were doing to warm him, but adding warm water or keeping his jar under a warm lamp are only temporary ways to fix the problem.  The warm water will cool down pretty quickly in a small container, and the changing temperature will just stress him more.  The light would last longer, but there's no way to control how warm the water gets.  The light really should be turned off overnight, then the water will cool down again.<br>  <br>  If you can't buy these things new, check craiglist or freecycle in your area.  Or thrift shops or the classifieds in your local paper for yard sales and auctions where you wouldn't have to pay as much as you would if they're new.  Just check if the tank holds water and the heater works [you should have it completely in water before you turn it on, and let it run a day in the tank to make sure the temperature is right before you put the fish in].<br>  <br>  A heater for the size tank he;ll be in is really the most important to have. You can use a clean plastic storage container for keeping the fish if you have to, you just might not be able to see it as well.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	a fish bowl would be a start.  get a tank or else he will always be miserable.  <br>  if you have anything glass, and big, with a definite bottom, not just rounded on bottom unless you add gravel.|`|rhTCejrtaa	yeah get him a tank they are really cheep. and you need to keep him in a place with a consistent temp. and that has a lot of people in it.|`|3ZOPNdxOaa	how can you keep a fish in a jam jar? it seem cruel.. <br>  try one of these <a href="http://www.cheappetproducts.net/TRI-PLEX_3_COMPARTMENT_BETTA_TANK-UKP44791.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheappetproducts.net/TRI-PLEX...</a><br>  this is a very cheap item to buy|`|NwZ6yrq7aa	Mine are in 2.5 gallon tanks from Petsmart/Pet supplies Plus ($12).  Filter ($11) optional.  2 of my betta's have real long fins and cannot tolerate the filter, i clean it twice a week (1/2 the tank water) and spot clean the poop each day (takes 2 minutes).  Get a heater!  They have ones that just warm the water 4-5 degrees above your room temp.  The heater is a biggie.  I bought a betta that was flesh colored with maroon stripes in his tail, COOL!  got him home, added a heater and now he's bright red all over!  Cups, small flower pots work for hiding spots.
SgeIPqKlaa	Well, he should not get much bigger.  When he turns a year or so, he will start to fill out and muscle up.  I think he will get about 65-75 lbs.  Remember, pits are very strong  and will have a lot of muscle.  Muscle weighs more than fat!!!!|`|4bdbf4e7de2cb9318867d83bd2e4c57caa	When full grown your Pit should be about 18 - 22 inches in height and weigh about 30 - 60 lbs.<br>  <br>  The website below has a bunch of info if you are wondering anything else about your dog.|`|TY04XXUFaa	first i feel really bad for your dog that he got abandoned <br>  i hope he is ok now<br>  your dog might get a little bigger up to 60 pounds probably the most that your dog will way|`|gTXUcd1maa	It is really hard to tell. From what you included i believe he will be between 60-70 pounds maybe a little more or less. Good luck :)|`|Bw18seFqaa	if he's 7 months, he's not going to get much bigger..  maybe 60- 70 pds or so.
C1eHfhrHaa	1. Unless your dog has been on a monthly preventative for heartworm, then they will do a snap test to make sure that she is still negative.<br>  <br>  2. It causes too much bleeding.  Some vets will do it, but it is much riskier.|`|O6SBsgO8aa	The reason they dont like to spay close to ending the season is that the uterus is still swollen and is more work for the vet as there is more risk of the dog bleeding out.  However I have had a friend who have had their dog spayed a week after ending season (a dobe) with no problems.  It is just a policy some vets adopt.|`|FdcWPp48aa	1.  She should have been checked for heartworms when you first got her and you should have her on heartworm prevention.<br>  <br>  2.  She can still be spayed, but there will be more bleeding internal and the charge will probably be higher when you get the bill.<br>  <br>  Thanks for being responsible dog owner.|`|Bw18seFqaa	1.  it would be dangerous to put her under if she is HW positive, it doesnt matter what drug is used.  She would have to be treated for the HW first.  A HW test isnt ussually done unless you request it.  If she tests negative, I'd go ahead and start her on preventative.<br>  <br>  2.  When a dog goes into heat, there is increased swelling, it takes about a month for the swelling to go down...  if you spay during that time, there is an increased risk of bleeding during the surgury..  it "can" be done during that time, but its risky and most vets prefer not to spay then unless medically necessary.
vbEkYH2haa	I would be worried. Take him to the vet now, as it will still be in his crop. <br>  The vet should be able to extract it with out too much discomfort. If you leave it there it could cause an obstruction or poison his tiny system with what ever glues or metals etc have been used on it.|`|1gDTiPVyaa	Get her to the vet so it can be removed.|`|xshrKvIRaa	The same thing that would happen to you if you swallowed a tack or nail. DUH! Take it to the vet!|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	I would be very worried about the type of metal in the stud. If it is sterling probably not too much to worry about for poisoning. However you would have to worry about it traveling through the digestive tract and causing blockage. If it was a plated base metal or had a magnet imbedded I would be very worried. In fact if it was my bird I would have already called the vet and asked advice. Are you absolutely sure it was swallowed? Your best bet is to call the vet or the emergency clinic and ask advice. You have 2 serious possibilities here----metal poisoning (can be very serious or even fatal) or blockage.|`|AqgJyMn6aa	you should probably take it to the vet
zWACtmiIaa	well, it's going to take a while before you're riding like they do on T.V. So don't expect to be galloping right away!<br>  <br>  But, riding different disciplines can make you a better, more rounded rider. <br>  <br>  Do you have a horse? If so then stick to what your horse is trained for, unless you're willing to get another horse. <br>  <br>  Do you have someone to teach you how to ride western? Teaching yourself could end up hurting you or your horse. <br>  <br>  Do you want to jump? If you do I would stick to English. You can do little jumps in Western, but not super big ones.<br>  <br>  Western saddles are more comfortable on trail rides, and barrel racing is pretty fun. But remember, you're going to have to learn how to ride Western, unless you're just walking or trotting on a trail ride.<br>  <br>  If possible-ride both! <br>  <br>  If you can't ride both then maybe take a few western lessons and decide which one you like better. <br>  <br>  Or maybe you're just not doing the right thing in English. Try cross country, dressage, jumpers, hunters, or go on some trail rides. If I ever start feeling bored I go on a trail ride or make an obstacle course for myself! Or try riding with a friend!<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to try new things, because it makes you a better rider!<br>  <br>  Happy Riding! :)<br>  <br>  EDIT:::<br>  I forgot to mention that you should also try going bareback! It's really fun, but make sure that the horse you ride isn't too boney! Owwww :(. <br>  <br>  Also-how long have you been riding? If you've only been riding for a few months, or even for a year it might seem boring, but once you get better it'll become more fun!|`|1uR2zPnEaa	I ride both, taken lessons at 2 different barns, and I have found personally that i enjoy english style alot more, i'm trail ride in my english saddle! I LOVE western sports! and i love JUMPING! but for a trail ride i always grab the english.. i would go bareback but my horse is a tb and he's NOT comfortable bareback! lol he has a western saddle, but i hate the fenders and stirrups, and the horn! oh my gosh everytime i bend down to avoid hitting a branch i get my gutted by the horn it's so annoying!!<br>  <br>  but anyways.. i have nothing against either sport or style.. it's just for comfort i choose english<br>  <br>  try both styles! try an aussie saddlle? or endurance saddle!?<br>  try EVERYTHING you can! thats the only way to find out what you like and don't like<br>  <br>  if english is boring you, go for westerm go all out!! it will be a breath of  fresh air!!|`|xzJi0bcSaa	TV isnt really a lot like real life. Just saying. I think that if you can afford it, ride both. Both have a lot to offer and both teach you quite a bit. Western has its advantages, gaming is a lot of fun and all about speed and skill, Im not a fan of western pleasure classes because (at least in my area), its all about how slow your horse can go and how low the head can be. A 4 beat lope isnt natural. I prefer English but, I grew up riding western so, its new and different. Im working on jumping and dressage right now. (sort of, when it warms up I will be!) but Im training my 3 year old western right now because it seems to be the easiest saddle to ride in on a young horse. It sounds more to me like you are getting bored. Do some patterns or something to spice up your riding. Go ahead and try Western if youd like, both are great! :) Hope this helps!|`|BkJ7pxQZaa	Western! :] If you're not enjoying what you are doing now, just try changing it up. Lots of different games they do mainly western, low level barrel racing, pull bending etc. I personally ride both western and low level english. I would for sure pick western over the two.|`|qXqgiXPDaa	I ride in Both.<br>  I Do more things with Western Discipline Though.<br>  I only ride English when I have free time.<br>  Western is just a natural for my competing horse.<br>  English is alot of fun but it does mean looks of Dedication, It's Way More Expensive and Where I live it's hard to find English shows.<br>  I like Western Better but I LOVE both!|`|flMlup19aa	If you like a lot of speed and more fast paced get into the gaming world of western. And if you want a more low key you could alwqays get into pleasure. You could ride both too. Or get a horse that needs work in both disciplines and work with him to get him really good.|`|B38evt9kaa	you could do both, like western on the trail nad english in the arena. or when you want to do jumping and dressage english and if you jsut want to have fun in the arena western|`|n2dUmfcQaa	Western pleasure all the way! it is so much fun but you need to have a good saddle for you and your horse|`|psNR7hDJaa	I would seriously suggest western. Haha I love Heartland! I watch it too! I'm guessing you are Canadian then? Cause I am not sure but I thought that only Canadians can watch it. Not sure. Anyway, western is pretty cool. There's lots of different events. And since you said you aren't looking to compete, you can do them for fun or even go trail riding. Trail riding is much more comfortable western style, especially for long rides.|`|dBRxfRGqaa	both. you can develop really good skills when you do both, but start on one. don't let people's personal opinions  effect what you do, and don't let people's skepticism effect your opinions. both of them are great disciplines, and you can learn different things from each of them. just have fun, and if you like one better than the other, go for it! <br>  people are way too opiniated on this topic, so don't listen when people say western sucks or english sucks. it's a personal opinion.|`|qIOYS9vKaa	haha my name is katie 2(except i spell it differently)<br>   WESTERN WESTERN WESTERN<br>  I used to ride english 2 about 2 years ago<br>  i did it for about 3 months and i thought it was way to proper.<br>  So i went to a western riding camp(at first i didint want to got cuzz it waas western)<br>  But then I fell in love with western.

You can pretty much do all the same recreational things in each saddle. So it is more about comfort. Do you like the 'feel free' feeling or do you like the deep seat in western? It is up to you. I ride both english and western. It also depends upon, for me, what I feel like that day.|`|7CIg9Gmraa	100% WESTERN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  i dont have anything against english but, i have done 4-H and horse actvities for 11years. i have tried riding english and it is fun but western is WAY better to me!!!!

If you aren't a very experienced rider you aren't going to be doing much of that. If you've just started out, then what you're doing isn't going to be very exciting.

Its really sad to know how many are without homes out there. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&S=0&C=0&A=1459" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&S=0&C=0&A=678" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&S=0&C=0&A=584" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a>|`|C1eHfhrHaa	You will have to wait until she is a few more weeks along and get an ultrasound done.  Remember, most chihuahuas need c-sections, so if this was not a planned breeding you should be talking to your vet about a spay/abort.

Great watchdogs, loving companions, just the best.  They don't require the amount of exercise that people say they do, although they adore fun and are willing to go anywhere with you.  They'd all like a job, even if it's only riding to the post office with you or helping you take out the garbage.  Mine were great sheep herders, and practically taught themselves to do it.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Its always been a tie between the Australian Shepherd and American Pit Bull Terrier.

9RH0ZkSXaa	they are definitely dusk and dawn active so i feed my balls in the evening.<br>  i dunk mine in hot water.<br>  they dont care to much for smell - mine can smell them straight out the freezer with viv closed - especially my large male! greedy bugger!<br>  but as said before they are pitted snakes to food needs to be warm.<br>  they dont give a damn if its soaking wet and most breeders feed wet n warm. i soak mine to nice and warm, then dab with a towel.<br>  also i found that dry heating with microwave or hairdryer actually starts a fast gut rot and i have had a rat explode on me with a hairdryer before!<br>  just hold by tail or with tongs, offer and hang.<br>  it would be best if you left them to be fed by someone who knows what they are doing.<br>  on the other hand offer a meal before you leave and once you get back. (if you feel bad just offer a bigger meal - but no thicker than fattest part of snake) this time of year a lot of snakes brumate and often wont be fed at all. missing one or even 2 feeds is going to do no harm!|`|xhZ0nFTYaa	Yep - they're quite nocturnal.  Heat the food with a hairdryer - don't dunk it in hot water as it washes the smell off and balls are quite reliant on smell and heat pits in their nose to detect food.  Persist too-it sometimes takes ages to get them to strike.  Best of luck.|`|3kMt0vNvaa	yes. or you can just feed them with the room dark and turn the uv light off|`|EuJTvGkxaa	Yes at night would be the best time. I have had my ball python for 6 years and he is always more active at night. It is also way easier to feed him at night. I'm pretty sure gender doesn't matter.|`|GXFLWjE4aa	I agree with her but I will say that if your ball python is hungry it will eat at any time of the day but later is better. also if it is an adult ball python it can easily handle no food at all for that period of time but the water dish should be replaced daily this all depends on age of the snake ofcource
FH2wl0OTaa	Was she the runt of the litter?  I've often wondered if that has something to do with the clingy/snappy/passive/aggressive behavior in Border Collies.  <br>  If she were a herding dog, she'd probably be drawing blood on the sheep and taking pieces out of their ears.  <br>  I think people worry too much about their Border Collies getting a lot of exercise.  My Collies are really good at sleeping and hanging around when they aren't needed.  Take her for a walk and forget the dog park!|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	I recommend seeing a professional behaviourist to work on your dog. <br>  <br>  Just normal training classes don't seem to be right for her right now. <br>  <br>  I have a website for you about fearful dogs. I hope you find it helpful. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://fearfuldogs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fearfuldogs.com/</a>|`|dl1OOOT8aa	You are forcing your fearful dog into these extremely stressful situations, i.e. the dog is forced into a fight-or-flight drive mode. Placing this type of dog in more stressful situation will actually make the dog more erratic and unpredictable. <br>  <br>  Dogs are pack animals, they don't need to play with strange dogs. As pack leader you need to make sure you are protecting your dog. Because right now the dog is seeing that you cannot protect her and she is forced to fight.|`|FdcWPp48aa	I hate dog parks. <br>  <br>  Your dog is fearful and you need to work on that.  By taking her into situations that she is overcome with fear, you are not helping her.  There are classes to help dogs like her.

I discovered that it was because he just wanted to know I was there.  <br>  They are showing their feelings for us and trying to communicate them.  Whistling/singing is one way that they know how to do this.|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	Aww he just wants to be with you-he is bonded with you. The running back and forth means "pick me up pick me up" and the singing is to get your attention. My boyfriends cockatiel does this, especially if we are paying attention to each other and not him. Just a tip...if you are in bed trying to sleep put a blanket or a sheet over the cage. I do this every night. This keeps them a bit warmer, they know it's bed time and they....stay quiet. But ya...he just wants love from you that's all.  <a href="http://parrotcentral.net/" rel="nofollow">http://parrotcentral.net/</a>
JfBzzXQ4aa	Yes, mixed breed dogs can compete in Agility. NADAC, USDAA, CPE, ASCA, UKC & DOCNA are all open to mixed breed dogs. There are plans for building Agility equipment on-line. There are also books that have that information. There is different equipment & specs depending on the Agility Organization, so read the rules. The best way to start an Agility dog for a beginner to the sport is to take a Beginning Agility class. Your dog will need to be a year old & have basic Obedience to start. Your dog will need to be socialized with other dogs & people, have a Sit & Down, a Stay and a solid Recall wth distractions. Look for an Agility club with classes in your area. Ask your vet, phonebook, word of mouth. Try to attend some local  Agility trials to watch & see the sport first-hand. Good Luck & Have Fun!<br>  <br>  NADAC: <a href="http://www.nadac.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nadac.com/</a><br>  USDAA: <a href="http://www.usdaa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.usdaa.com/</a><br>  CPE: <a href="http://www.k9cpe.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.k9cpe.com/</a><br>  ASCA: <a href="http://www.asca.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.asca.org/</a><br>  UKC: <a href="http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/WebPages/Home" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukcdogs.com/WebSite.nsf/WebPa...</a><br>  DOCNA: <a href="http://www.docna.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.docna.com/</a><br>  <br>  Edit:  He's an 8 month old mixed breed male. Get him neutered. He will make a happier, healthier pet & a more reliable Agility partner without hormones distracting him. I see you have taught him some behaviors. I don't see a stay or a recall on your list. Work on those for sure. The recall is essential for Agility work. Needs to be reliable with distractions.  :)<br>  <br>  Edit: You measure a dog's height from the ground to the top of his withers  (the highest point of his shoulder) Re-measure. The jump heights are based on the dog's height & are different in the different Agility Organizations. So look in the rules. The highest any dog would ever have to jump in Agility is 24 inches (AKC dogs over 22")  or 26 inches ( USDAA dogs over 21"). You should not jump a dog any higher than hock height until his growth plates are closed to avoid permanent injury to his growing joints. On a large breed dog this may not be until the dog is 18 month or so. Consult with your vet. Jump height is slowly increased as the dog learns to jump, gains confidence & becomes fit for jumping.           There is no way to build an open tunnel. That is one piece of equipment that pretty much has to be purchased. The closed tunnel or chute, you can make the round part out of a plastic barrel or oil drum & then purchase the cloth part to attach <br>  fairly cheaply or if you sew you can try to sew one.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Use the PVC pipes for weaves and for jumps.  You can build a shute with an old barrel and brace it so it doesn't move then attach some lightweight canvas for the other part of the shute.<br>  <br>  There are dog agility books out with directions on how to make lots of the equipment.  Do an Amozon books search about it.<br>  <br>  In AKC they have to be purebreds, but in NADAC (which my lab is registered) and I think another agility association, they can be mixed breeds.  I do believe in all of them the dogs have to be neutered and spayed.|`|Chxoncy7aa	Since he is only 8 months old, you should not be jumping him yet.  Wait until he is at least a year to jump him.  You can still teach the jump command, by laying the jump pole on the ground, or no higher than 8".  My first agility dog is an uneutered AKC Ch.  It has been an extra challenge with him because sometimes he has other things on his mind besides me and agility.  My younger dogs were neutered, and what a difference.  I highly reccomend neutering him for competition, it will make your life and his much easier.|`|7Rp256IOaa	Welcome to the world of agility!  This is a great activity for both you and your dog.  Yes! you can enter mutts in agility competitions!!!  Check out www.usdaa.com, www.k9cpe.com, www.nadac.com, www.docna.com.  These are all agility associations that offer competitions across the US.  If you are entertaining thoughts of competing your dog in competition I would highly recommend you enroll in a local agility class to learn how to train your dog right from the start.  There are some specific ways a dog is supposed to negotiate some of the obstacles that if not trained from the start can be difficult to retrain later.  Its better to learn right from the start.  Check out www.cleanrun.com for some books on building your own agility equipment too.  Good luck and have fun!!!|`|66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	Weave poles are the easiest things to make. All you need is 3/4" PVC. Cut them to length at an angle, and you can push the sharp end into the ground. You can also make jumps out of PVC or wood, and all you need is a wooden plank to make a see saw or a dog walk.
H06PtiIAaa	cleaning crews, hermit crabs, nassuarius snails, starfish will help move the sand. moving hte sand will help reduce the hair algae.<br>  <br>  Also check to make sure you have phosophate removers in your filter media which will help reduce algaes. Also cleaning it by hand helps glass algae.|`|RXYZb6bsaa	ur producing too many phosphates thats the problem, adding phosphate remover or algae eaters wont fix it.  It sounds like bryopsis and if it is the only garunteed thing to eat it is a sea hare which die once theyve eaten it all and are toxic.  You should set up a refugium or other nutrient export system and feed more efficiently|`|tgROmqffaa	If your tank is on the smaller side you may have too much light going into the tank.  Especially if its in front of a window where it can get a lot of natural sun light.  The light will fuel the algae to grow.  If you limit your sun exposure or put a timer on your light to limit the light you can reduce algae.  If you put an algae eater in your tank that will also help eliminate the natural algae that forms.|`|5c5e9767db0aa6f5bac57f3e406b4092aa	i think the best way to get rid of the algae is to just kind of yank some of it out.  try not to get anything caught in the algae while youre taking it out though.  snails should help with this too.  maybe add a sand star, they feed off of algae too, i believe.  your tank might be getting too much light, turn your lights on later/off earlier and limit how much sun goes in (maybe set up a blind or something) good luck|`|qeOlkRM0aa	You have too much or poor quality light, and you may be over feeding. Pull out as much  of the algae bt hand as you can.

The attitude of the rat can come from a lot of things. Some of it depends on how much they were played with when they were babies. Some rats will be comfortable with you right away and some need more time. She will need to get used to her surroundings and then get used to you. Best to let her do it in that order.<br>  Giving her a treat inside the cage can help. That way she will associate you with food and that should help a little bit.<br>  The main thing that makes me a little worried is that fact that you just got one rat. Rats are social animals and do better with a friend to sleep, cuddle and clean each other. Please please please consider getting another one.<br>  Just her do things at her pace and she will be much happier then if you rush her.<br>  Hope that helps a little.<br>  :-)|`|Z1inkvcnaa	its a wild animal why would you want to snuggle with a rat in the first place.  but if you ask me get some rat poison and kill it before it kills you.|`|BvJeEbWlaa	Well, if you just got him you might want to let him relax and get used to you and his new environment. I also suggest getting another rat. Rats are extremely social creatures and yours is going to be very sad if he doesn't get a friend soon! My first rat was extremely hyper until I got her a friend, once she had someone to play with she burnt of that excess energy so when I play with her she is calm!|`|tss8aoDcaa	hes scared after all that chasing try not to let him slip away|`|7SyCZnM9aa	try working with him gradually. open the cage door and offer treats from the palm of your hand. his cage is his safe haven right now because he has no idea where he is and what's going on. so you just reaching in there and plucking him out is just making things worse and will make him want to avoid you more. let him come out of the cage himself. You can try enticing him out with a treat onto your lap. let him sniff your hand and get to know your smell. talk in a low and calm voice when around him and no loud music, as they have sensitive hearing. sometimes bucks are crazy when they are younger, but settle as they get older and lazier lol. just be patient and work with him, let him move at his own pace.|`|N5tF9xjdaa	I'm having the same problem.<br>  I just got 2 baby females yesterday.<br>  <br>  As an experienced owner, I'd have to say that this is COMPLETELY normal, don't listen to those terrible negative comments.<br>  <br>       The first thing you have to remember is that your rat is still a baby, and if it is in the 'pet-store' age (the age you normally buy them if you get them from pet stores), they will be quite a bit skittish and bouncy, especially if they don't quite trust you yet.<br>  <br>       I'm not sure how long you've had him, but you're going to want him to just get used to his cage and the way you do life here. Don't force anything on him.<br>  If he latches on like that (mine do exactly the same thing), it means that they're just trusting you yet.<br>  Just slowly start to stroke him and let him take treats from you, he'll learn to trust you and calm down around you. <br>  <br>  Until then, calm down and talk in a slow cheery voice, and softly socialize with him.<br>  <br>  Feel free to e-mail me for more help!!<br>  Please do if you have any other questions.|`|ZEIqeThNaa	Rats are great pets, however they should never be keep alone. You need to have them in groups of 2 or more. It may take a while for your rat to get use to you. If he was not tame it will take a while to make him tame. Handle him as much as possible hold him with treats in your hand. They love garbanzo beans. They also like berries, bananas<br>  grape/raisins, apple, broccoli, sprouts, tomato, corn, peas. Give him things that he can play with. It's important to not make loud noises, which may startle or scare him. Always speak in a soft tone, reassuring and soothing your rat, especially when first approaching the cage. There are many Rat owner forum to help you.
R0WgaUdgaa	If you are going to have boys they are going to get big and fast. Even with 2 you may want to consider a larger cage.<br>  If it were me hun I would go get the other one. They already know each other and would get along well. <br>  We had 2 for the longest time and after one passed away we got 1 other one. Then 2 days later we found out about one that needed a good home and took her in as well. I have to say it was a good idea.<br>  There is a little more cleaning and a little more attention needs to be paid but this way if something happens to one the other would not be alone.<br>  Hope this helps a little bit.<br>  P.S. about the cage,<br>  if you want to see how many rats you cage will comfortably hold, there are website you can put the dementions in and it will tell you how many rats it should hold.|`|OrvTG44laa	Yes, rats are happier when there are more rats.  Getting the other one will be a lot of fun for them.  There isn't much difference in the costs.  Your rats would be very happy to have another friend. <br>  That cage isn't suitable though.  While it provides a lot of climbing space, there is little floor space for the rats.  I wouldn't want to keep one rat in there, let alone three.  I suggest returning that cage if possible, and buying one with much more floor space.  6 square feet will do perfectly.  Remember to get one with multiple levels too.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Once you have two, it really isn't any more expensive to take care of more.  Everything will remain about the same as far as price. Their behavior may become more on edge until they figure out their social hierarchy. Since these rats were housed together before, I don't think it will be an issue as far as fighting or having to quarantine. Sometimes getting a third wheel goes smoothly and other times it throws the whole group dynamic off.|`|xB2wRYYBaa	the more the merrier<br>  <br>  although they cage will get squishy even with 2|`|ZEIqeThNaa	The cage you have is not big enough for two rats let alone 3. Having 3 rats together is great, because they are very social animals. They require a lot of space especially male rats. Your cost will go up, but really not that much. The cage should be cleaned once a week at least with 2 or 3 rats. Make sure you don't mix male and female rats for obvious reasons.
YRJFo6K0aa	It's wonderful that you want to volunteer your time helping out with animals, and I encourage you to pursue this generous and rewarding experience. The bad news is, most shelters and other organizations with animals require their volunteers to be at least 14 years old because of the guidelines of their insurance companies. The good news is, if you're clever and determined you can find ways to volunteer with animals anyway. The key is to talk to people in person; if you make yourself known and the people in charge see how mature, skilled, and determined you are, they are willing to bend the rules. There's a chance some of those places that say they don't accept anyone under 14 will allow you to work if you have a parent with you. They might also have some jobs that you can to to help the animals but do not require direct contact with them. Collecting donations of towels, cat litter, money, etc. would be a great way of helping the shelter that I am sure you would be welcomed to do. Tasks like these may not sound like as much fun, but believe me, when you turn 14 and start competing for the more exciting jobs and volunteer positions it will give you a wonderful advantage. At the very least, the staff at the animal shelters should know a lot about the other animal organizations in the area and may be able to recommend another place where you would be allowed to volunteer.<br>  <br>  Finally, don't let anyone convince you that you're too young to work with animals! I was once a 12-year-old frustrated with age limitations on volunteering positions, but I never let this keep me away from animals. Many wonderful volunteer positions and jobs later, I am now an employee of a vet's office/full-time student preparing to apply to veterinary school. Good luck, have fun, and don't be discouraged by setbacks :-)

dl1OOOT8aa	Take him to the vet. Sounds like the dog is experiencing seizures and needs to be diagnosed and treated properly by a vet.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Dogs have dreams. Twitching and eye rolling(to some extent) is normal for a dreaming dog. If its going on for hours and he is not waking when he try to get him to then its probably something else and possibly a seizure.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	he"s dreaming.  Why do you think its a nightmare?  He maybe chasing a female in his sleep.|`|cY4vg9VAaa	First of all, if he's sleeping, how can you tell that his eyes are rolling back? When your eyes are closed, they roll back. Twitching is common in sleeping dogs, especially puppies. Also, it's not proven that dogs dream, let alone have nightmares.

If you are going to keep the cat,please keep it indoors or it will just get hurt again,as it is mating season.The cat needs to be neutered and a home found for it. Call around to all of the area shelters and ask if they have room for him ( call only no-kill shelters.)

It is available in a Tincture, or a cream.<br>  <br>  If you are able to get the Calendula Tincture you will need to put 10 drops in a small bowl of warm water and use that to bathe the cat's face after you have used the Epsom salts.   It is anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory and a rapid healer.<br>  <br>  You can also put 3 drops into his water bowl, and stir it in well.   If he is a cat who does not drink water, then put 3 drops in an eggcupful of water and use a teaspoonful of this on his food every time you feed him.<br>  <br>  You can buy it here if you can't find it locally.

It won't harm your cat in any way, it will just dissuade him from chewing on the plants.

He might get the message if you do either or both.|`|6AqdyWgzaa	Cats eat green leafy things for vitamins and chlorophyll, It's good for them.

Cat grass satisfies a cat's craving for green but doesn't make them sick.<br>  <br>  One thing you need to do is stop punishing your cat. He is not a dog and does not understand why you lock him in the bedroom- the punishment does not occur right after the crime and so he does not associate eating plants with the spare bedroom. Simply telling a cat NO in my experience has little effect. They don't listen to commands, so a physical action is a better solution.<br>  <br>  Here are some high-rated cat grasses:<br>  <a href="http://www.thatpetplace.com/pet/prod/214527/product.web?gdftrk=xh23lc0p/7HDy~g3JgKLcwbOOX6Nglvxhj89kAs1M7nEh9Or~qmJrE/XaO8VQvxlUx2AtjHwKz/zXor3~ID/ndftii2KQPzJgzc~0F3tMfE_" rel="nofollow">http://www.thatpetplace.com/pet/prod/214...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?pcatid=18603&cmpid=02csegb&ref=3312&subref=AA&ci_src=14110944&ci_sku=0032577000000" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...</a><br>  Cat grass is very inexpensive and saves you money in the long run- you don't have to keep replacing your other plants! Good luck.
G0KKfXMUaa	Edit- Everyone is saying "LOTS OF HILLWORK!" Please do not do this. You said your horse is dramatically fragile and barely has muscle. A lot of hill work could be dangerous for such a weak stage. As I said in my answer, hillwork should be done once she begins progressing and has a good amount of weight and muscle back.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If she is this fragile, yes, I would begin with longe work.<br>  <br>  Get in a round pin (this is most prefered), or get in a large corner of an empty ring/arena. Put the halter on her, and attach a longe line to the inside metal square on the halter. Make her walk to the outside. Allow her to walk around once or twice before trotting.<br>  <br>  To trot, just click to her. If this does not work, just kind of "flick" your hands up and click once more. If still no long, step towards her and flick your hands more rapidly. And if she's still just walking along, slightly "bend low" as if you were a predator and make a weird movement. I know this may sound stupid, but it will definitly get her to react. And if not, just resort to a longe whip (shake or crack it behind her).<br>  <br>  I would longe her for about a week and just walk when riding her, or do a really slow sitting trot.<br>  <br>  The reason I wouldn't do too much is because, from what you said, she's VERY fragile. <br>  <br>  After about a week, begin to have her canter in the longe line (first warm her up at the walk and trot). At least a few times around (each way), and try not to let her break into a trot.<br>  <br>  At this point, I would still only walk and trot her when riding.<br>  <br>  After a few weeks, and you've noticed good improvement, you can begin to canter her when riding. Observe her very well, however. If she seems in pain, or reluctant to go, I would have her checked before continuing. But if all goes well, then that's great!<br>  <br>  And of course as she begins to gain a decent amount of muscle, you can begin trotting poles, circling, and in general ride longer. <br>  <br>  Once her muscle mass becomes more "normal", I would begin doing uphill work. But this will be a ways in the future, so for now just focus on the task at hand.<br>  <br>  Other tips for building muscle-<br>  <br>  It is good to have her fed a lot, but the quality of the hay and feed also matters a great deal, as I'm sure you know. Do you feed your horse yourself? If not, I would check the brand and quality of the feed and hay that is being fed to her. You can also try adding a good vitamin supplement to her diet. Also try to give her a lot of pasture and grazing time.<br>  <br>  And if you are still uneasy about over working her, make a plan and have your vet overlook it. This would be most accurate.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HeTltnwraa	lunging and hill work is good and lots and lots of trotting builds them up.<br>  <br>  persistence is the key if you can ride her lightly everyday that will do her wonders.<br>  <br>  since she was soo underweight make sure she has all the minerals she needs... salt and mineral block licks are great!! put one in her paddock and whenever she needs some she will have a chew on it!!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|r5XLbLpVaa	All i can say is HILL WORK<br>  <br>  trotting up and down hills, not so much cantering......but trot out on the trail and trot and trot and trot!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally i don't like ring for muscle building because it is SO much work that needs to be done and horses get bored and ring-sour!!!(I'm also prone to getting v. ring sour!)|`|0474910698a964873e0ea0d9f3879256aa	Work him out.<br>  lunging would be your best bet, bt just at a trot.

My horse was severely under weight when i got him and that's what helped him. But you have to do it mostly everyday. Let me know how its going and if it works:) Kellikatastrophe1022@yahoo.com|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Just realize that it isn't just her muscles that are weak and under-conditioned.  So are her joints, tendons, and ligaments, so any conditioning program should be set up with cooperation from your vet.<br>  Developing muscle mass will combine an exercise program with a coordinated diet.  I wouldn't begin any exercise program without first having the vet assess her and clear her for it, and then help you to design it.|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	Lots and lots of hill work!|`|Q7jLqFZmaa	I strongly recommend lunging, and getting a daily workout for yuor horse. if you use Parelli, it will work to get her not only comfortable, but completely under control, if that is a problem.

51St5GEcaa	Onion toxicity causes a Heinz body anemia. Heinz bodies are small bubble-like projections which protrude from a red blood cell and can be seen when the cells are stained. This "bubble" is a weak spot in the red blood cell and, therefore, the cell has a decreased life-span and ruptures prematurely.<br>  <br>  If a lot of the red blood cells are affected and rupture, anemia can result. It is a form of hemolytic anemia. Onions are only one of the substances which can cause Heinz body anemia. Other substances such as Acetominophen (Tylenol) and benzocaine-containing topical preparations can also cause Heinz body anemia in the dog.<br>  <br>  The toxic effect of the onions are the same whether the product is raw, cooked or dehydrated. The hemolytic episode usually occurs several days after onion ingestion (lowest hematocrit around day 5 post ingestion)|`|637af0df73292f4d1c8ec85214c9a369aa	According to Dr. Karen Halligan from spcaLA:<br>  <br>  Onions are toxic to pets.

The reason I find it hard to stomach is because it actually SOUNDS like it would actually be a real breed (not "oodle" something) and people really wont believe that its just a mutt.

I mean, people started buying these things because they were supposedly hypo-allergenic, which of course no dog is 100%, but here they mix one "hypo" dog with another. WTH!    The worst part is all these people who pay a couple hunderd bucks or more for a first generation labradoodle, where the "hypo" part of the mix doesn't even take effect for sure until the third generation.  I'd hate to think how many of these dogs are bred for profit and then sold to people who cant keep them because they are allergic.  I got lucky I guess, my wife is severely allergic to most dogs, but our giant schnauzer causes no probs.  come to think of it, haven't seen one of those in a designer combo.  would that be a giant schnoodle? i'm sure theres one out there.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Pit Bull Mastiff.

d4883a7276992a3ca7a277be538a52acaa	I think BSL is entirely wrong and discriminative to certain breeds of dogs.<br>  <br>  While there are breeds that are certainly prone to different temperaments it depends mostly on how the owner handles and raises their dog on whether they will be aggressive or good.<br>  <br>  Usually the breeds that sometimes suffer from bad tempers thus getting a bad rap are the breeds like pit bulls and rotties but only because people prefer them for fighting. Also some people mistreat their dogs and that makes them have behavioral problems. <br>  <br>  Then again if one breed is canceled out what's to keep people who approve BSL to go down the list and eventually start marking off all dog breeds as a whole?<br>  <br>  No one breed is bad but rather the people who bring out the worst is bad.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in breed specific legislation because it will endanger the breeds that people love and adore and for all the reasons listed above.<br>  <br>  Hate the deed, not the breed.|`|26PPwzrWaa	100% agree. <br>  <br>  Irresponsible owners are the issue.|`|6G4hcPzAaa	two small words-hate it...
PHOyKsmPaa	Do not segregate the dogs from the kids unless you have reason to believe they are aggressive.  They will naturally get to understand that they can't have your undivided attention. Be sure to take them on a long walk either while your babysitting or before and after. This will relive their need for exercise and make sure they are "pooped out" and relaxed when you need to concentrate on the children!|`|FsS7MfFyaa	Ide suggest getting a crate and getting your dog acclimated to it.  Then slowly put him/her away for longer periods of time.  When your done with day care make the next half hour all about your dog.  Walk him/her, pet or brush and just play praising him for how good he was.  Dogs need to now who the master is.  until they do they will be more than happy to assume that role =]  Hope this helps|`|NUaWX0Guaa	The dog is probably jealous and you shouldn't punish the dog for it. You could always put him out side or in another room. I understand that your probably skeptical but you could always tie him to a piece of furniture or something so the dog cannot get to you or the child. You should enforce that the child has right to be there as much as the dog. If the dog doesn't like it, make it leave the room (outside, another room). Bring it back when it calms down until it learns that it is ok to be in the room with the child and you. Sorry if this doesn't help.|`|nqB7BNqtaa	Sounds like the older dog is just having trouble accepting you as the leader of the pack. He probably hasn't accepted the baby as the new leader of the pack either. If you google the Dog Whisperer and follow a lot of his techniques, he will instruct you on making sure you are the leader and the dog is the submissive one. The Dog Whisperer (Cesar Milan) is very big on saying that animals can pick up on the human's energy and the dog may be picking up on your anxiety. But constantly wanting your attention and begging for it seems to be a clear sign of dominance. I would read Cesar's book about being a pack leader and follow his advice.|`|88SGoW1Iaa	just kennel him up while you have babies there, the risk of him feeling jealous or bothering you while you work is too much to let him roam. Don't feel bad it's not punishment, it's just life. But be sweet to him after the kids leave
5RRMLzvzaa	You'd better start being honest, and just try to find a gentle way to bring it up.  Next time you see them and make small talk, you can say something like "hey, we've been hearing your dog barking a lot lately, is it alright?" or something, and that eases into the topic without being accusatory.  If they have any sort of morals, that might be enough to make them try to solve the problem on their own.  I know I'd feel awful if one of my neighbors pointed out they could hear my dog, my tv, my whatever, and I'd take steps to make it better just because it's the right thing to do.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work, you'd obviously have to escalate it to the township organization or something.<br>  I know how you feel, though, our old neighbors had a yorkshire terrier that would bark incessantly any time it saw us - we couldn't enjoy our back yard because of it.  They were oblivious to the thought that it might annoy people.  They also just sucked at teaching their dogs manners in general :P|`|RBx4eJHtaa	throw a shoe at its head.<br>  sorry no, <br>  ermmm dont think there anything.<br>  if your really good friends with your neighbours ask them to shut it up!!<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|kOoCya9Oaa	When you act like a door mat people will walk all over you.<br>  Grow a pair.|`|Jfa0QcBsaa	shoooooooooooot it|`|11a867519828ee7f2df6eda7cb34fb8faa	Well, first of all you have to start being honest.  Go back to them and say, you know how you asked about the dog barking and bothering me?  Well, it is starting to get on my nerves.  (Are there any particular times of the day?)  Mention those times.  Take some little dog biscuits over with you so you don't sound like a dog hater. But honestly, I understand.  I have several dogs in the neighborhood who drive me crazy and our neighbors don't know one another.  If I approach them about the dog, it's automatically confrontational.  Do you have a civic community meeting or anything where you can address the barking dog issue in general?|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Go down to your local pet store and ask them for a "Shut the F*** Up Whistle".  They'll gladly assist you with your purchase.|`|4DonDdbvaa	Either give the dog a dog stick with deadly sharp bits in it. Ask your neighbors politley whether face to face or letter. I you ever play with it chuck a stick down a well hope it chases it. Move your house about so put the rooms you don't go in much near their house (depends rooms will vary in size).|`|2943TijNaa	oh God! another person with the same problem as my families house!<br>  we live in the middle of two neighbors who both have dogs that dont shutup!!<br>  we've done everythingggggg. it didnt work lol. so finally my dad sent a complaint to Seacca (the dog pound in my city) and all that was sent back to us was a confirmation that both  of the neighbors got a complaint letter sent to them. If no action is taken, there will be further action taken....soooo try sending your local pound a complaint! Hopefully it works, it doesnt always work with us, but now my dad just goes up stairs and says shutup!!<br>  lol<br>  GOOD LUCK!!<br>  <br>  oh by the way, the letters are sent anonymously! so they wont know who complained!
2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Invest in a crate and pop the dog in there when you are not able to supervise her.  House training is much quicker and easier if you use a crate.  I wouldn't leave her in a crate for hours on end. A crate is a very good training tool but should not be used as a containment system.<br>  <br>  I would be a little concerned about the frequent peeing. Collect a specimen of her urine in a clean container and take the specimen and the dog to the vet. She may have a urinary tract infection.  She should be taken to the vet for a general health check in any case.<br>  <br>  If you adopt a dog from a shelter you can't expect you will get a perfectly trained dog who will fit your lifestyle and into your house without a period of adjustment.  You need to put some work into teaching your dog to behave the way that suits you.<br>  <br>  Bringing a new dog into the house is always stressful, particularly if you are a novice dog owner.  It just takes a little time for you and the dog to settle down and get into a routine. Give it time and it should all  fall into place.|`|ohWkoTtGaa	She might not be used to her surroundings & new home yet.<br>  <br>  And maybe she just happens to be a jittery dog, the previous owner cant be completely the blame;<br>  <br>  Just give her some time to get used to her surroundings, then if she doesnt stop i'd buy her some papers to do her stuff on.<br>  <br>  Dont take her back, thats seriously wrong.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I would suspect a medical problem, since most dogs do not urinate that often.<br>  I just housetrained a foster chihuahua, and while she went all over the house at first, she did not go that often.<br>  Have you had her checked by a vet? The constant motion might be because she is in pain from an infection.|`|39lyKAMJaa	You should of thought about the "time" it takes with a new dog. The dog is attached to you and you are going to take it back to the SHELTER???? It's people like you that should NEVER own a dog!!!!|`|PM23RDycaa	And as I said before - Chihuahuas bond to one person and usually stick to that person like glue.<br>  <br>  Terriers are active breeds and need exercise and attention. And considering you wanted to know last week why people preferred to have dogs go to the bathroom outside why does it matter NOW that you have a dog who's not house trained fully?<br>  <br>  You should have adopted a breed or mix that suits your style more which is obviously an easy going independent dog.<br>  <br>  IF you decide to keep her<br>  <br>  1. Buy her a crate to sleep in NOT the bathroom with the door locked<br>  2. Obedience training<br>  3. Stop trying to walk her off leash. Just because your neighbor's and landlords have had highly trained dogs doesn't mean every dog is born wanting to stay buy their owner. <br>  4. Learn some freaking paitence. You have had this dog one week and you expect perfection its not going to happen with ANY dog that fast.<br>  5. Either feed her on or schedule or take her outside more frequently. If need be take her to the vet (which you should have done so by now) to make sure there isn't a medical reason for why she is going to the bathroom so often.
c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	I agree with a couple of the others answers, about her being a little overweight, but nothing close to "unhealthy" looking as per your hubby.  Having two dogs, it could be hard to monitor the feeding especially if you free feed.  Some more walks/exercise will help and less treats if you give her alot.   Hmm, just read the Pedigree thing - you should probably change that to a better food, they will eat less of a nutrient rich food than they do of Pedigree (healthy food compared to McDonald's, for us).  And yeah, no more table scraps, unless it's veggies or fruit (no onions, asparagus, grapes, to name a few).  They may stare at you and make you feel bad, but you'll be doing it for their health, just remember that.  Good luck!  Beautiful dogs, too...|`|AA11244754	she may be a little on the plump side but why don't you take her to the vet and have the vet weigh her and see if they think that she's overwieght.

It has poor quality ingredients (think of all the bits of animal carcasses that humans don't eat or make into geletine) and also they test on animals (as does their parent company mars)<br>  <br>  I'd recommend looking into feeding a homemade diet, or getting a light diet food from the vets.

What are you feeding them?|`|C5YBD3F1aa	She is very overweight. A healthy Labrador is built more like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.chanpemakennels.com/images/content/amber.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.chanpemakennels.com/images/co...</a><br>  <br>  You can easily feel the ribs and slightly see them, but they aren't poking out.<br>  <br>  It is sad that so many Labradors are lazy house dogs these days and don't get to live life like a true Retriever. :/<br>  <br>  They should weigh  50-60  pounds. (Some are smaller.) <br>  <br>  Please, slowly cut back her meals to where she is getting a proper portion. It is obvious she is being fed too much. And STOP feeding  her table scraps! It causes bad behavior and it causes them to gain fat, not only that but some human foods can be VERY dangerous to dogs!<br>  <br>  And being bred and then spayed doesn't affect their weight, not enough exercise and too much food does. All spaying does is change their matabolism level. You just have to get off the computer and take her on long walks, take her to the beach, play fetch, etc. I would suggest you get into a fun sport, like agility, once she is down to a healthy weight. Or you could do hunting; any Labrador loves to hunt. Keep in mind that whenever a dog gains ONE pound, it is equal to gaining FIVE to SEVEN pounds to humans. The extra weight is severly harmful on their joints.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "People are less active than they were in the days when most worked at manual labor or exercised by splitting wood, hunting, hiking, or other physical exertion. Television, computers, and spectator sports have replaced action and high-calorie snacks have hastened the decline. Even with the emphasis on low-fat foods, we still eat too much - and feed our pets too much - for the amount of exercise in our daily lives.<br>  <br>  Obesity in dogs is a serious medical problem. Fat dogs are more at risk in surgery, more prone to injury, and have more stress on heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, and joints. Excess weight can worsen osteoarthritis, cause respiratory problems in hot weather and during exercise, lead to diabetes mellitis, and generally lessen the quality of life for a family pet.<br>  <br>  An owner can control his pet's weight by realizing that food is not a substitute for attention or a cure for guilt and that firmness can and should be applied to the relationship. An owner who cannot resist Fluffy's soft, pleading eyes whenever food enters the vicinity is an owner contributing to Fluffy's obesity and may even be shortening her life. An owner who cannot rouse himself for a few hours each week to make sure that Singer gets enough exercise is an owner contributing to Singer's obesity and may even be shortening his life."<br>  That right there is proof that what I say is true. I figured I would quote something from a website so that you would believe me.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	She could drop a few pounds. Overweight dogs have many more health problems as they age. Cut back on her food, don't free feed and make sure she isn't scarfing up the other dogs food. A good walk works wonders, but make sure you build up the "miles" gradually<br>  <br>  add: ugh Pedigree mostly fillers. Do some research on dog foods, and ignore the stares<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/</a>
gYLkvAnjaa	Many people leave food out for the dogs all day long, but having a once a day scheduled feeding time has it's benefits.  Try this-feed your dogs once a day in the morning after they've been out to go potty. When they get used to eating once a day, they will eat all their food at that time.  Also, feed your dogs seperately.  Try feeding them in seperate rooms.  Leave the food out for them and then close the doors.  Check on them in 10 mins.  If there is any food left, put it away and let them out to play, run around, etc.  An hour or so later, seperate them again and offer them the food again.  Do not stay in the room with them while they are eating.....this way they will get used to eating without you being present.  Keep repeating this every day and soon your dogs will get  used to eating all their food when it is offered.  I have 4 dogs and they go by this routine every day.  They are not underweight from eating only once a day, they eat all their food within minutes, and no one eats the other dogs leftovers.|`|h8fvKM1jaa	I had a lhasa and golden and  had the same problem, what i did is putting one bowl in a room and keeping the other's bowl in another room, giving them food at the same time, standing in the middle not allowing any of them to go and eat for the other's bowl, removing the food immediately after they finish. i did this for a while till they got used to it.|`|mgKQffvkaa	First of all, stop feeding them by hand. If they refuse to eat don't worry about it. All dogs will eventually eat once they get hungry enough.<br>  <br>  Second, to solve your problem, continue to feed them separately. Lock one dog in a room while the other eats and vice versa. This will ensure that neither dog eats the other's food. Simple solution.|`|AA11027960	Hey i completely agree with the answers above me so good luck and keep up the good work bo :) you are doing great
6ZZ8gSsRaa	look for one that has a first ingredient that is a meat; dogs need meat.  most cheap kinds will have wheat as the first ingredient and this isn't healthy for them.   i would suggest a higher end purina-its cheap but can have good ingredients.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	The cheapest food I'd feed my dog is Natura Healthwise.

wLgGD63raa	No, your gecko will not need a UVB light. They are nocturnal animals and will do just fine with a UTH (Under Tank Heater). You will need to give your gecko D3 still, I personally use a product called Leopard Gecko Dust. It is a powder that you dust their food with, I dust my gecko's food with it once a week. You will also need to keep a dish full of PURE calcium in the tank with your leo at all times.<br>  <br>  Yes, you do need a moist hide for your gecko. You don't have to use moss, you can use wet paper towel or reptile carpet instead. This hide is used to help your leopard gecko shed. The humidity will condition your gecko's skin and it will be easier to remove. Without it you have issues with stuck shed skin around the toes and tail that can sometimes cause them to fall off. Be sure to set your humid hide on the warm side and have a hide in the middle and on the cool side as well to make sure your gecko is comfortable.|`|oerG1fo6aa	You don't need any of that stuff..<br>  <br>  I had one for a good 4 years ( I couldn't answer how old he was when we got him, he just didn't grow from the time we got him)<br>  <br>  We had heat rocks, as bedding we bought this sand with basic minerals, and a few rocks set up as a sort of "cave" and that was really it.  With the water bowl as well of course and the basic food requirements.<br>  <br>  You all are just jealous lol.  Consider the leapord gecko environment dum-dums.  He lives in the desert, he needs heat that he can soak up and store for night, food is scarce so they store what they can food wise in their tails.  Not a lot of maintanance besides the occasional cage cleaning.  You want to go the extra mile?

78im4WUcaa	Use a simple hot water and bleach solution. Make it roughly a 20:1 ratio, so essentially your looking at only 5% bleach. Use a towel or washcloth to scrub down the walls, bottom, hides, soak anything in the cage. Use a dry towel to get most of the water out, then let it air dry for a bit..a couple hours or so. You want it to smell clean, but not have a strong bleach odor. Do this every 3 months. Otherwise just spot clean daily and change the substrate completely once a month.<br>  <br>  I keep my snakes in plastic bins when Im cleaning their enclosures.

5RRMLzvzaa	It depends on your lifestyle and what you want in a pet.<br>  <br>  The beauty of cats is they are a lot less maintenance and a lot less needy of your attention.  They won't require nearly as much time as a dog will, which makes them perfect if you're busy, travel a lot, or just flat out don't feel like having to devote a ton of time to your pet.  You don't have to walk them or bathe them, and they are pretty easy to leave behind when you go on vacation.  I find that they still provide plenty of companionship and entertainment, they're just not noisy and in your face about it like a dog (well, mostly... I do have one annoying cat).  When I come home after a really stressful day at work, I can just plop myself on the couch and unwind and not think about a thing, and I know that if I had a dog, it would suck to have to walk him no matter how pooped I was and no matter how good that couch looks.  Downsides - you have to keep the claws trimmed, and some damage could be done to furniture.  They also tend to vomit and cough up hairballs somewhat often.<br>  <br>  Dogs of course have the advantage of being more interactive with you - you can walk them and they're more active in play, and they can go on vacations and hikes and whatnot.  However, they'll want to be interactive with you even when you don't feel like it, too.  They have a lot of enthusiasm and outward affection, but it's not like cats don't - my cats come to greet me by the door, if not as exuberantly as a dog would.  The downside of dogs is that you have to walk them, or let them out, constantly, or else they poop on the floor. And you have to do it even if the weather outside sucks, and you can't stay out late because you have to walk the dog, and you can't leave the dog at home when you go on vacation without having to find a sitter or kennel.  They get wet dog smell, whereas an indoor cat has no smell.  You have to bathe them, they bark, and they need training (cats need very little).  <br>  <br>  So, pick which is right for you!|`|YBcB0732aa	It depend on how much time you have.

gjrbp1Aoaa	Get her spayed.<br>  <br>  It's harsh, but that will help save the lives of other kittens. <br>  <br>  We found a pregnant girl and let her have the kittens because we were able to find good homes for them before they were born.  But I still feel guilty about the shelter kittens who didn't get homes because of that decision. Plus giving them away was horribly painful for us and mom. Getting her spayed will be easiest for you and it will be easiest for her. She will be confused but she would be confused anyway even if she was spayed after they're born.  Girl cats have some crazy hormones.  My girl is so much happier now without them.<br>  <br>  If you call around to some different vets you should be able to get a good price for getting her spayed. <br>  It's painful to think about, but it's the right thing to do.  If I ended up with another pregnant kitty I would get her spayed. There are just so many homeless kitties and so many disturbed people who get kittens just to hurt them.  <br>  good luck with her!<br>  <br>  edit - I agree, make her an inside pet.  She'll be much safer.<br>  putting up fliers for free kittens is not safe.  People will take kittens and use them as bait to train fighting dogs, snake food, sell them to places that do animal testing, torture them...  It's just not a nice world. That girl cat is the priority. She needs to be safe and healthy.|`|kNYDHZqAaa	Take her to the vet and get her checked out. Maybe she is pregnant, maybe not. The vet can give you more info on whether she is pregnant or not, and if she is maybe they can tell you how many kittens she will have. If it's a small litter, maybe you could find homes for them with people you know. If you think you can't take them in or find homes for them, then you might want to have them aborted :( But yes, get her spayed, and preferably keep her inside. Keeping her inside will keep her out of trouble, and you'll get to know your pet better that way.|`|bDO0Gm4Jaa	Take her to a vet.  Pets are not very expensive to keep, but there is a cost to being a good pet owner.  If she does have babies, try hanging fliers for free kittens around in other neighboring towns.  If you want to keep her, you have to be responsible.  There is just too many strays that go without homes, become ferrel, and have to get euthanized.  It's not fair for them.|`|dyb61F6Xaa	I would send them to a better shelter that's close.

But...Take her to the vet and get her spayed (males get neutered.. lol).  They will spay her and abort the kittens - its the best thing you can do for her.  Until you get her spayed, keep her indoors!  And I'd also suggest making her an indoor cat after the surgery.  She'll live a much longer and healthier life!<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that thousands of kittens get put to sleep everyday because there arent any homes for them!  You're best bet would be to abort the kittens.|`|g0c85gTSaa	Well it sounds to me that you have no options left.  If the cat is pregnant and you dont feel that there is no decent animal shelters, I recommend that you just let the cat be and stop feeding it (considering the fact the cats come back to you if they're fed) and let it depend on itself. Cats can give birth by themsleves and take care of both them and their kittens, its their nature.  Dont worry about it, she will be fine and take care of herself.

JfBzzXQ4aa	If you are talking about AKC registration papers. Yes, you can change the name. Here is the info. : <br>   The name of an AKC registered dog may be changed provided the dog was whelped in the United States. Further, in cases where the litter owner(s) first individually registered the dog, the litter owner(s) written consent shall be required. A dog name containing a Registered Kennel Name cannot be changed without the written consent of the owner(s) of that Registered Kennel Name. However, no change in name will be recorded by the American Kennel Club after the dog has produced or sired an AKC registered litter or has received an award at an AKC-licensed or member event. Any name change must comply with all AKC requirements.<br>  <br>  You can download a Dog Name Change Authorization application from our Web site.

8aOTvtEUaa	Not too much longer than an hour, they can only hold it approximately 1 hour for every month they are old. This is just approximate though I have a thirteen week old puppy that can hold it through the night, if you keep the dog in your room it will be easier to tell. My dog sleeps in my bed and sometimes in the middle of the night she will get up and i'll take her out.|`|FdcWPp48aa	The rule of thumb is puppies can hold "it" for one hour for every month of age.  Your pup is one month old and can hold it for one hour.....  Too young to be away from it's mother.  <br>  <br>  House Training<br>  <br>  <br>  House training your dog is simple if you follow a few basic rules. Remember that puppies younger than 10 to 12 weeks have little control. Accidents will always happen when teaching puppies to be clean in the house. Be kind and patient, and reward handsomely all outdoor elimination. Always remember that dogs do what works for them. Make outdoor pottying work really well for your puppy.<br>  <br>  <br>  1) The puppy must have NO time unsupervised in your home. NONE. If you are not directly watching the puppy, it should be in the crate, or outside in a safe area. You MUST watch the puppy at ALL times when loose in the house. Use baby gates, crates, or tie the leash to your belt.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) The puppy should sleep inside the crate by your bedside. This way you can hear if the puppy should happen to need to go out during the night.<br>  <br>  <br>  3)  You must go WITH the puppy outside for ALL trips for elimination. You must have treats with you. When the puppy is urinating, say "GO PEE PEE" in a nice praise tone of voice the entire time. When she is finished, pop the treat into her mouth at once, and praise praise praise. This should be something she gets at no other time, like tiny pieces of string cheese or boiled chicken. Same for defecation. Say "GO POOP" while she is going, and food reward and praise afterwards. You must observe and reward ALL outdoor potty time. <br>  <br>  4) Keep a schedule. Feed at the same time, and walk outside at the same times. Your pup needs at least 4 trips outdoors each day, and 5 is probably better. Pup needs to go out at wake up time, lunch time, 4-5 PM, after dinner or any other meals, and before bed. Younger puppies may need to go out much more often.<br>  <br>  <br>  5) Use a key word each time you go out. I say "Let's go out!!" in a happy tone of voice each time I'm opening the door to go out with the dog.<br>  <br>  <br>  6) If you catch the puppy IN THE ACT of eliminating in your house, CLAP YOUR HANDS, say AH AH, OUTSIDE!! And immediately rush her outside. If she finishes there, do your usual food reward and praise.<br>  <br>  <br>  The keys to getting your dog reliably housetrained are:<br>  <br>  <br>  SUPERVISION: NO loose time in the house if you are not watching<br>  <br>  <br>  REWARDS: ALL outdoor elimination MUST be observed and rewarded. If you only do this ONE thing, your puppy will get housetrained.<br>  <br>  <br>  PATIENCE: Anger and punishment have no place in dog training. Elimination is a natural and pleasurable experience for your dog. You can teach her to not soil your house, but punishment will NOT help. It will only teach the dog to hide when she needs to eliminate.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have applied these techniques carefully for 4 weeks and you are still finding spots or piles after the fact, it's time for stronger measures. Roll up a newspaper and fasten both ends with a rubber band. Keep it handy. The very next time you find a spot of a pile that the dog has left behind, whip out that newspaper, and hit YOURSELF over the head firmly several times as you repeat "I FORGOT TO WATCH MY PUPPY".<br>  <br>  <br>  Works every time.<br>  <br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  <br>  This article copyright 2004/2007, RedyreRottweilers.

AUJ6uG0oaa	Why would you want to go that route?<br>  <br>  I would look into using a bosal (you may need to look around to get a larger one).  A bosal gives you all the natural, humane benefits of a bitless bridle, but will apply enough pressure to stop the horse if she gets a little to frisky.<br>  <br>  I start my horses with a bosal, and then use a double rein set up to train to the bit.  Kind of like the opposite of what you are trying to do.  For that I use just a basic snaffle with one set of reins and a nylon halter under the bridle with another set of reins attached as a safety brake.  So I know what you are trying to do but I don't think it will work.<br>  <br>  If the horse does not like a bit, why use one.  Even a "soft" bit will probablly cause anxiety for the horse.  If the horse gets a little to much to handle in a bitless rig, certainly pulling on a bit (with a horse that hates bits) is not going to make the situation better.  I would try a good bosal.  it requires no bit, but you should be able to apply enough pressure to forward movement to keep her under control.<br>  <br>  I would also think about working in a smaller area.  A small paddock, or large round pen first.  Something where she can feel free to move but not free to get out of control.  Then build up to larger areas until you can ride her in the open with no problems.|`|4AfRTzRmaa	it really depends on what bitless bridle version you have. You may be able to get a strap that does connect the shank part of the bitless briddle to a bit, if i am thinking of the type of bitless bridle you have.   or maybe you could fasten something to it to make like a flash noseband to hold the bit..... hmmmm if you have a trainer or have her at a barn ask them. good luck. By the way,my favorite breed of horses are the dutch wamblood :)|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	Some bitless bridles are extremely strong and that is maybe what she is objecting to.  However I guess you could thread an extra headpiece through the browband so that you have cheek pieces on each side, as in a double bridle, but attach a mild bit to that and use two reins.  Since I stopped riding I have seen some very strange combinations of tack, and if they do not cause distress and do the job, then yes, try it, but try any new combination in the school first to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  It does sound as if you might be over horsed.  If it gets too dangerous, you might be better off selling her and getting a smaller one.<br>  <br>  Have you had her back and her teeth checked?  That could be another reason for her unruly behaviour.<br>  <br>  Have you tried a Pelham?  That can be fairly strong but on the top rein it rides mostly like a straight bar snaffle, and the bottom rein is for more control - like you say, in emergencies.<br>  <br>  My horse was only small - 14.2 but boy, could he tank.  He rebelled frequently|`|YHpePjb9aa	.... use a chifney head strap with a soft bit and then put the bitless bridle over the top.... you will then have one set of reins to the bridle and one set to the reins. There is also a new bridle out... but i really can't remember the name of it!!! i think it begins with a 'M'.... It can be used as a bridle, headcollar or bitless bridle. IT is about ￡100.<br>  <br>  I have just looked it up on google.... its called a Micklem Bridle|`|RoPLmd2daa	Have you tried a hackamore? They can give you more leverage than a bitless bridle, but wouldn't mess with her mouth.<br>  What kind of riding do you do with her? Try doing groundwork so that eventually you can steer her with your legs or rein pressure.|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	The Micklem bridle isn't all that great:<br>  <a href="http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/forums/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/3466844/Main/3463163/" rel="nofollow">http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/forums/sh...</a><br>  The bit clips can rub quite badly:<br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=1340409&l=65766&id=507350870" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=13...</a><br>  This is a link to all the advertising for the bridle:<br>  <a href="http://www.williammicklem.com/multibridle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.williammicklem.com/multibridl...</a><br>  <br>  I think you have a training issue, not a bit issue, that needs sorting out. All the money you may be tempted to spend on gadgets to 'control' your horse would be better spent on quality training...|`|tZtFVr23aa	Have you tried a Hack?|`|p6QycgC0aa	I dunno if that's possible, but try slowly reintroducing the bit. what i did with my horse when he was a two+ and time to introduce the bit and bridle, I bought a copper roll d-ring bit (you can use another bit of course).  I put molasses on my hand and let him lick it clean. I kept doing this. then i put some on the bit (and hand) and let him lick it clean. I kept doing it. Then i took away my hand and just put molasses on it and have his again lick it clean. eventually i put the bit in his mouth and let him "spit" it out. this (i guess) made him free the he wasn't forced to take the bit. I kept doing that until he was relaxed about the bit. then i added the bit to a western bridle (because no nose band and still using molasses) but i didn't put the bridle completely on. i did this until he was again relaxed but to the bridle. then i put on the bridle. at first i put on the bridle praised him then took it off. then left the bridle on a little longer. then longer and so on. Because i took it slow and gave my horse A LOT of praises, he accepts the bit with no problems. once he sees the bit and bridle he opens his mouth.  All this isn't all in one day. i did each step until he was relaxed and then moved on.<br>  <br>  Make it a big deal on how good your horse is doing. use a calm voice to help her relax. I hope i helped you.  and please be safe!!!  Maybe this will help your horse realize that you aren't going to hurt her with the bit and trusts you|`|xzJi0bcSaa	It sounds like she needs some work, not a new bit. I would do a lot of ground work and ride in an arena, get her to respond to voice commands and such. I wouldnt leave the arena until you have her responding to you. Most of the time, its the training (not saying you did bad, but she doesnt respect you if shes running away with you) not the bit. I hope this helps!
AA10097817	I had two children, the youngest was 6, when my husband decided we needed a puppy. Well, I disagreed. I was finished with the toilet training and didn't want the responsibility with the puppy. Oh, no, he says, I'll do all the work. Unfortunately, that isn't reality when you work 50 miles from home and work 8 hours a day. It wasn't fair to the puppy, and it wasn't fair to me.<br>  <br>  Get a cat.

rrLHU6ehaa	The hornpout, also commonly known as the brown bullhead catfish, is often found with members of the sunfish family, including largemouth bass, crappie (10" +), and bluegill.  The last 2 are schooling fish and do best when several are kept together, but you could try a single crappie.  They are a beautiful fish.<br>  Keep in mind that in some states it is illegal to keep native fish without a permit and usually illegal to keep non-native fish that can live and thrive in local bodies of water.<br>  <br>  It does depend on what you mean by large.<br>  The hornpouts average size is about 8", but they can grow quite a bit larger.  Common plecos grow to 18" and more.  So the 2 fish you currently have are pretty much more than enough for your tank.|`|2vBYTCUDaa	oscar|`|KAX0HCfTaa	You can get a gourami.

AA11992723	she sounds bored..if you entertain her more (training, daily walks, chew toys like kongs) she'd probably be happy relaxing in the pen when you need her to be there. Imagine if someone put you in a pen for hours you know? try to see it from that pov. depends on how old she is and energy level, but a 45 min walk a day could fix the whole problem.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Yeah - I have a black lab mix we call Houdini dog . :o)<br>  <br>  First, make sure you are giving her enough exercise.<br>  Are you taking her for walks, and getting her out where she can run and play?  Does she have plenty of toys and chews to play with?<br>  <br>  You need to put a clip through the gate latch, and you can put hotwire on the fence - up high so she will not climb, and low so she will not dig.<br>  <br>  You can find the transformer, wire and connectors at a feed store or some pet stores.|`|Drnpe4T5aa	LOL - You seem to have gotten the female version of a dog we used to have.<br>  For the digging out of the kennel, I put med/large rocks around the inside perimeter.  (About 8-12 inches across, each)  In the corners, I stacked 3-4.  Too big to move or chew up and swallow.  (And I am not saying that in jest - he chewed *everything*)  Also, I lined the bottom of the kennel with some plastic kennel flooring.  They came in large sheets that could be connected.  I just made sure the rocks covered the edges, so he couldn't get ahold of one of them and have a "starting point".  You could also use chicken wire over the dirt, but again, cover the edges.<br>  For the top, get some thick plastic, or metal, like for a lean-to roof.  Use metal ties (like for link fences) to keep it in place.<br>  For the latch, we used a combination bike lock/chain.  I just wrapped it around a couple times so the door was held tight.<br>  <br>  We literally tried everything to prevent the chewing.  I was told that I was not exercising him enough, and that he was bored.  So I tried walking him several miles each day.  We would come home and he would still destroy stuff.  <br>  So then I trained him (and he was so smart - he picked it up in a flash) to walk on the treadmill.  He would walk for 1-2 hours, and *still* have energy to jump around and chew things up.  <br>  In the end, we just had to make sure he didn't have access to *anything* (other than a few select dog toys that could stand up to the abuse) because he would chew and destroy whatever he could.  I'd like to say that he grew out of it, but he didn't.  <br>  Good luck to you!  :)

aXsq6N2Yaa	In the USA it is legal to keep a fox as a pet, The one You found was probably somebody who abandoned it. Get it a Small-Medium dog collar and tags, make the bright blue, so they stand out against the fur. Also make sure you get it a special diet, ask your vet. You might want to get it a small kennel and a harness and train it to walk on a leash. Think about springing to get a microchip too, and DONT let stranger pet him until he has a temperament assessment by your vet!<br>  Hope this helps.|`|yrue6Qjwaa	Sure you could get your fox a collar! I know someone who take her pet bunny for "hops" down the street and he has a tiny little collar.

You're not supposed to keep or even interact with wildlife if you're not a licensed wildlife rehabilitator or something like that.  If you want to hang out with it then just hang out with it outside but don't keep it in your house.  I LOVE animals but I do not condone the keeping of wild animals as pets.  If you really want a pet then you should adopt a dog from an animal shelter because that way you'll be saving a life.|`|8ksBt6Xraa	I have 6 pet foxes and they all wear collars.|`|TU7vDI95aa	Definitely get him a collar and tags if you want him to be returned to you should he get lost.

Why would they give away the kitten for free if they'd payed for vet care? I would suggest going to your local animal shelter and saving a cat or kitten that really needs your help. People drop kittens off at these places every day because they were too irresponsible to have their animals spayed or neutered. You could also check your local newspaper's classified ads.<br>  <br>  No matter where you chose to get your animal, please be responsible enough to have him or her fixed. :)<br>  <br>  At the pet store where I used to work, the kittens all had their first shots, tested negative for feline leukemia, and came with a care sheet, medical record, certificate for a free kitten check-up from a local vet, and a voucher that the vet signed when you get the cat fixed that gives you a $40 gift card when you turn it in. So don't rule out pet stores!
gjrbp1Aoaa	It can be really tough to tell.<br>  <br>  Some cats will make the most horrible noises imaginable when they aren't hurt at all.  Some hiss and arch their backs while playing. <br>  Without being able to see them when they get like that it will be really hard for you to tell.  In general, even though they play using almost all the aggressive body language, folding their ears flat backwards seems to be reserved for when they are actually upset.<br>  Be sure to check them out for injuries if it seems like a real fight might have happened.  So far mine have never actually hurt each other.<br>  <br>  I have 6 kitties, 1 female.  I only get concerned at the rare times when someone gets cornered.  For the most part their arguments are minor and even if they are serious, they don't last and no one ever gets hurt. Come nap time everyone just piles up together anyway. <br>  <br>  As far as what your female is thinking, I wouldn't worry too much.  Females tend to be more territorial, I know some people say otherwise but I strongly disagree. Since they would have to be mothers territory (albeit usually smaller in size than a male's territory) is even more important to defend.  Even when they're spayed females can be very serious about their home.  But considering that they do well together so much of the time, I think she's ok with it. They're siblings now, it's normal to disagree sometimes and it doesn't mean that she'd be happier without him.  I am quite sure that my girl would sad if she didn't have any boys to pounce on. She will probably become at least somewhat less nervous about him and he will gradually calm down too and that may make his existence less stressful for her. She should be ok. I don't think you should worry.  Plus if you get too stressed about it they'll pick up on that.  They will argue sometimes but overall I think they'll be happy to have each other for company.<br>  <br>  edit - about the shedding, switching mine to really good food helped a lot.  They eat Wellness Core for lunch and Evo for for dinner. They're soft and fluffy, but with less shedding.|`|35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	If there's no blood or tufts of fur flying, they're just playing.  Check your cats ears.  When cats fight, they rip apart each other's ears first.  Also check for bald spots.  My dog likes to "poke" my cat and one day, the cat laid on his bone and wouldn't get off (cat was taunting the dog with his claws), so the dog lunged at him and pinched a huge chunk of fur off his side.  Didn't hurt the cat, really, but the cat had a quarter sized bald spot on his side for weeks.  And the cat STILL lays down on the dogs bone.  Oh well, they'll work it out themselves. The cat has claws, so the fight is even...  plus, the cat outweighs the dog by 4 pounds (he's a 28 pound monster kitty).<br>  <br>  As for your shedding issue...  Get the furminator and brush your cat often.  I've also found that lint rollers and pet hair removers are a waste of money.  Just use a damp rag and wipe down furniture with long strokes.  The hair balls up and is easy to remove.  I have a 7 foot cat three that my 2 cats ADORE.  They love it so much that it gets so much fur on it that I could probably make a whole other cat out of it.  I don't know if you've tried to lint roll or vacuum a cat tree, but it's a pain in the hiney!  The wet rag works SO fricking good!|`|OoNivmTlaa	I had the same problem when i introduced a new cat. After about a week my older cat started to baby and cuddle with the new 1. They still play ,chasing each oher around and tormenting each other once in a while. They are just playing. So i would say,just give them time to adjust.|`|iIJm5JToaa	Awww cute.  I did the same thing, but I got a girl when I had an older boy.  half the time they chase each other around like madmen, and scratch, bite, and throw each other around for a few mintues. I yell at them to stop, and they do instantly (if they were fighting, they'd keep it up, just like a kid)  Then they cuddle up for a nap. I think your are just playing, they seem to be a bit more vocal than mine, but the behavior is similar.|`|DtkLsetkaa	It sounds like play fighting to me, all kittens do this and its harmless as long as they are fighting politely so to speak ;)  Check them both for scratches and bite marks, but I am pretty sure they are fine.  When 2 cats are fighting, you KNOW it.  They scream like bloody murder and hiss and fur flies everywhere.  She will come into her own too, and fight back eventually.  I used to separate my 2 after a minute or two of play fighting, but then she got as strong as her brother, and she tackles him half the time now!!|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	a cat is a predator, a viscous killer. indoor cat people forget this, as they never witness it. indoor/outdoor cat people (me) and anyone who has watched ferals can tell you they are the same as a lion or tiger, just smaller.<br>  your two have the weapons and skill to kill each other.<br>  when they fight, you will know it.<br>  if they do not draw blood, or rip out fur, it is playing, or they are establisheing the pecking order. strongest cat leads.<br>  <br>  the yowling is postureing, saber rattling, if done before the attack, and a sign of submission during the attack.<br>  they  should both yowl before the attack, female should yowl during the attack to indicate the male has won.<br>  <br>  you see this repeatedly with a litter of kittens, if the strongest kitten does not stop the attack when the weaker one cries, mom belts the stronger one.<br>  <br>  best to leave them be, but continue to break it up. let them know you are stronger then both of them. like mom did when they were kittens.<br>  <br>  also, he was neutered late, so some of his aggressive male/mating instincts will remain.
2z69twcpaa	you never let a tortoise go back into hibernation once it is awake as they might not have the energy reserves to wake up again or survive, what you do is to provide a heated area and keep them awake until the weather gets warmer, the temp only has to raise up a bit for a few days for a tortoise to wake up, my two tortoises woke up a few days ago due to the unusual sunny weather they are now taking it easy under heat lamps here is a site that will help you understand hibernation and how to care for them when they come out <a href="http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/articles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/ar...</a>|`|MGAmNxddaa	Depends on where you live....and what type of tortoise? Most will rebury themselves when the cold hits again..if these ate turtles that hibernate....did something disturb his hibernation,do you know?In Ohio,they would normally not come up until May or so...|`|CgRGmzxZaa	You should research hibernation long before you put your tortoise into it! You could have killed him! They need a proper wind down process and a constant stable temperature in which to hibernate in . I suggest you keep him awake until next time and seriously read up on his care and hibernation before attempting it again.<br>  <a href="http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/safer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/sa...</a>|`|FQxbwbtlaa	my lizard walks in livin room wen wants to so see if he?she trys 2 get bake in
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	I would strongly object to your teacher about this. 2 Litres in NO WAY should house a very large messy fish like a Goldfish (or indeed any fish). This clearly displays blatant ignorance on proper fish care on your teachers part. THEY need educating!<br>  <br>  If you must do a project like this, use Ghost Shrimp, NOT Goldfish. I imagine your teacher is thinking somewhere along the lines of the Walstad Method:<br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Walstad_method" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Walstad_m...</a><br>  <br>  If you want a Goldfish to thrive you need 75 litres plus, over filtered and has completed the nitrogen cycle for 2-6 weeks before the fish is added.|`|tX27e0UFaa	Put it in water not soda. Google a plant that fish feed off and choose that plant to put it in. This plant would probably come from the same place as the fish environment. when the project is done just take it home, put it in a big enough container to keep it in and feed it fish food. Regularly clean the tank and dont over feed it.|`|e2be0a15c3672de325a1663ace314573aa	goldfish are surprisingly hard to kill, they are very hardy fish.  just feed them smal amounts regularly and cleant he water every week or two (empty out half the water and replace with treated water) and you should be fine|`|qfPXTJVZaa	Many times adding a bit of hot sauce to anus works because the fish will not pick up bacteria from there.|`|MFHfmRCsaa	goldfish in a  2liter? thats like putting an elephant in a mobile toilet!<br>  <br>  animal cruelty at its best...|`|MzP1U566aa	that is really cruel.<br>  don't do it.
Idunjsxjaa	Here's a web site that lists what rabbits can eat as far as fruits and veggies go.  Fruits should only be given as a treat and in small quantities.  I tried many from the list with my rabbit and he didn't want any of them! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content.plx?P=A&A=673&S=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.veterinarypartner.com/Content...</a>|`|980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	bananas, apples, oranges, plums, strawberries, etc.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	limit fruits (and carrots) as the high sugar content causes diabetes.  each rabbit likes something different, so try different foods.  provide a diet of fresh leafy greens at least once daily and lotsa timothy hay.  have fresh water available and some pellets for nibbling.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Fruits should only be given as a 'Treat',1-2 dessert spoons are plenty(per day).<br>  <br>  Berries:<br>  <br>  Strawberries,Raspberries,Blueberries,<br>  Blackberries,Currants.<br>  <br>  Tree fruits:<br>  <br>  Apples(without the pips),Pears,**Plum,Peach,<br>  Apricot**,Banana,Pineapple,Papaya.<br>  <br>  ** These fruits should have their Pits/Stones removed,since these are --poisonous-- to rabbits.

BWez86Ldaa	Phew. I'm always astonished by the number of idiotic replies to serious questions! Sheesh. Do not feed her lots of cheese.<br>  <br>  Starting off with a rat who is human-aggressive is very difficult and time consuming. Start by putting your hand in the cage, do not try to pet/pick up/feed her, simply put your hand in the cage. Allow her to sniff and explore your hand. Do this several times a day for about a week. After that week, start to offer small treats from your hand, like yogies or small pieces of fruit. Do not shove your hand in front of her face, but let her come to you. Do this for a couple days, several times a day. Once she is completely comfortable with taking treats from your fingers, try to put a treat on your arm, so that she has to climb you to get to the treat. This may take some luring, use one had to old the treat and move it from in front of your other hand, up your arm so that she has to follow it and climb on you. Keep doing this until she will climb on you herself to get the treat. Then try using treats to pick her up, use the scoop method. She may never be completely comfortable with being picked up, however. <br>  <br>  If you do not have time for this or feel uncomfortable spending so much time on one rat, I suggest you adopt this baby out to an experienced rat owner who has dealt with abused/lab rats. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sFUeytNTaa	let her get to know you and always give her treats.  first day just slowly put your hand into her cage  - and give her a treat. let her smell your hand and get used to your smell -rats main sense is smell. Next day begin to pick her up - with treats aswell. then close of an area - rat proof - and let her run around and approach you - give her treats. this is what i would advise for a new pet rat but i don't know what to do if she is still scared. Also i would really advise getting a second rat (same gender) once she is used to and familiar with you - a single rat can get very bored, lonely and depressed. if you can't get a second rat then atleast provide her with lots of entertaining toys and boxes and bedding. Here are some good  rat information sites to help you more:<br>  <a href="http://www.petwebsite.com/rats/handling_rats.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.petwebsite.com/rats/handling_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.curiosityrats.com/infolone.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.curiosityrats.com/infolone.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dapper.com.au/articles.htm#fuzzletworld" rel="nofollow">http://www.dapper.com.au/articles.htm#fu...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ratz.co.uk/petrat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ratz.co.uk/petrat.html</a><br>  good luck|`|mDYPgjiWaa	fart an what ever sound comes out name it that......hahahaha<br>  jk......name it amber|`|SuOfRTXzaa	who would want too ?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!|`|vrGyG5Esaa	Be patient. Theyre naturally friendly creatures but may take a long time to come around if shes never had a reason to trust people before. Try giving treats like boiled eggs, veggies, fruits etc from through the cage bars so she can smell you as well as learn to slowly trust you. Another good idea is to get it a companion. Theyre really social and 2 of them being played with together seems to help|`|VVc4On3raa	It will all come in time, she will get used to you and stop biting you, she just maybe nervous at first, if she is still scared after a long time ask a vet or someody or may know, im sure the rats cute and it probably is time :)<br>  <br>  Good luck xx|`|EbCsHW9saa	Hmmmm.... Put the rat in a plastic ball for the cat to bat around every time they are bad? <br>  <br>  Good Question for Victoria Stilwell on you me or the dog.... Maybe she will have some good ideas for rats as well.  My daughter loves her :o)|`|JmD0oq2Naa	no wonder its scared of humans, its probably spent most of its life having needles stuck in it and all sorts. be patient. try to get her in a box then take her into the bathroom and let her out of the box. if she comes over to you, dont make any sudden movements. place some treats close to you. and get her a friend. that could make her more confident|`|hHAdA9V9aa	Patience. I would keep going with the hand feeding; try work out her fave food - everyone has a guilty pleasure ;)<br>  <br>  I would try petting as handling could be difficult, get her used to you touching her before handling and she may not bite as much.
