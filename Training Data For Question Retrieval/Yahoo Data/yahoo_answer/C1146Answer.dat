KPDOrmTsaa	Hey girlfriend,  <br>  How about if you search for latest hairstyles?<br>  I've been due to get mine foiled and cut since early Dec., and my stylist, also dear friend is about to decapitate me, unless she gets her hands into my mane.<br>  It is so outgrown and the roots look like mud-splashed snow!<br>  I'll keep my eyes open and get back to you if I stumble on anyplace good.<br>  I'm craving something new since my hair is so thick and hot in the summer.  Usually I just tie it up on top of my head...|`|SehQJ3Kjaa	I wish i could help you. I am not familiar with one. But i will ask a few friends!|`|KH3kbRjgaa	Depends on your face type - what style would look good for you. I remember a site - I wish I could remember where it was [sorry] - that you were able to upload your picture - and then try various hair styles on it. Maybe visit a local hair salon and check out their pictures - you might also be able to get some free advice from them.  Good luck - a new hairstyle can be very exciting ?|`|RShi5KUmaa	i don't know of any websites but I would recommend going to a reputable salon that has a large clientele of middle age people.  They have books and you could consult with a stylist before you get your hair cut.  My stylist said the older you get the shorter your hair should be anyways.  And ask your friends too, I think friends give the best opinions on things like this.  Good Luck!!

But, his personality is what will make me want to keep him around. I've had some very attractive dates and boyfriends, but if their personality isn't up to par, their outer appearances become irrelevant. <br>  An average looking man with an amazing personality will keep me around longer than a gorgeous guy with no sense of humor. =)|`|O8pJYz5Kaa	Well i look for more then hot guys!

I don't want a hot guy who treats me like crap, I'd rather have a not-so-good looking guy who is sweet to me.  If I had to choose between the two of them.  It's all in the personality for me.|`|7BuPtMSMaa	well i know this doesnt help, but girls are natural hyppocrits and the stereotypical male is always going after that girl with ancd big butt & boobs , and most of the time girls think thats perverted. so yeah|`|bHBTgngvaa	i like a guy for themselves. but girls want to be able to say ' i have a hot boyfriend' and yeah...|`|CNKBGVgQaa	Sure girls want a hot boyfriend, but they still have to like them for THEM...what they like to do and how they will treat their girlfriend...?

ovPfkHSCaa	Many individuals have used various acne products without actually having any success in clearing their skin. And let's face it, acne is a enormous nuisance! Don't worry though - getting clear skin is entirely possible.<br>  <br>  First off, let's take a look the reason why the acne treatment products you buy in the drugstores almost never work. It's important to know this if you want to clear your skin. The trouble with most of of the treatments out there is that they are designed to only cover up or treat pimples AFTER they have already appeared. They merely try to get rid of pimples one by one rather than treating acne at the heart of the issue.<br>  <br>  More Info Here:-|`|oojO4WAraa	Do you bathe?  Switch to showering or start bleaching your bathtub to kill the germs.  Also bleach your toilet seat.  Try wearing cotton undies instead of synthetic.   Take Vitamin C.

96RDuDofaa	What kind of metal is in the piercing now?? Anything besides *REAL* gold or silver will definitely inflame the piercing and make it swollen. Change the earring to at least 14 kt gold, and wash the helix w/antibacterial soap until the swelling goes down. Good luck<br>  xD|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  Take it out and put rubbing alcohol because if its swollen its infected.<br>  Give it a week or so then put the earring back.<br>  <br>  I really like using 14K-18k (gold) as it does not make infection like silver or meta.<br>  It can also be that you are allergic to metal. So give it a rest and try again.  If it the swelling does not go down after all this see a doctor as infection starts etc.<br>  Good Luck|`|IROLLdMIaa	put something REAL in it like gold<br>  or sterling silver and put rubbing alchol on it<br>  everyday 2times a day until it goes away|`|on4ThDkQaa	It's probably swollen because the earring is too big.

6uYVRaebaa	ok this is not normal you need to take the barbell out asap let it heal and try again, or you can try to find a longer barbell, beware of the hole! keep an eye on it...not sure about tongue discoloration sorry :(|`|zkcOEU7jaa	call the shop you got it done at, and that can be normal to an extent.  sometimes, when your tongue turns those colours, you could have a certain fungus or bacteria in your tongue.  this probably just appeared because you broke the top layer.  If the people don't say it's normal in your predicament, go to the doctor, and they'll give you a prescription.|`|xK5mxlmnaa	don't take it out. it sounds like it may be infected. you should be using mouth wash after every time you eat, drink or smoke. and don't play with it. that will irritated the crap out of it and it'll never heal. but as long as your keeping it clean, and not messing with it should heal quick. if its still the same after a few days go back to place you got it pierced so they can take a look at it|`|1wiqwJOGaa	What I would do is go back to the parlor and ask them those questions. They wouldn't charge you anything. Or easier, just give them a call.<br>  <br>  From my experience, the hole looked nasty and it will take time to "close" or better yet heal. Let's not forget it IS  a wound.<br>  My tongue turned white-ish but I heard that was normal as there are dead cells on your tongue. Also pus is normal as it's getting used to your wound and trying to heal it.<br>  If everything is normal and your tongue is not infected, which shouldn't be if you have the proper hygene needed (wash your mouth after meals, clean it, etc) I would leave it alone. Just to make sure though, give them a call. It wouldn't hurt. It will heal in 1 or 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped :)|`|jh8vWqQzaa	Good answers, for the most part, above.  healing time for tongue piercings is 4 - 6 weeks, nothing less!  it can take longer, though.  <br>  It sounds to me like your barbell may be too short for an initial piercing.  i have seen this happen with no apparent reason, however, and they healed fine.  do not take it out!  that can cause more problems.  consult your piercer first.  a doctor will always tell you to take out a piercing cuz all they want to do is heal your wound. as a piercer, i want to safely heal the piercing.  <br>  alcohol product, like listerine, can cause this problem sometime, too.|`|b67b6b207d6484482b436e4a35975accaa	ya..that tongue color thing did happen to me 2.. just brush your tongue after everything you eat..now when you say that it is sinking in..like..will it fall out? if so just go up a guage or 2 when purchasing a new ring...if u r really worried..call the shop you got it done at..they will b glad to help u

School, Then as long as you have your license, It won't matter what you have for an education. Most Cos. Schools will accept anyone, and a few will have you write an Essay. <br>  GED(Nowadays.) are like a HSD. People say It matters whether you have one or not...But it really doesn't, as long as you have that degree(or license.).|`|dxkfLGGVaa	do an online course..its easy!<br>  please just earn your diploma it opens so many doors!<br>  and dont listen to any negative comments theyre not worth your time<br>  best of luck :)|`|MBqoeaEJaa	....well there is always welfare and a job flipping patties at mcdonald <br>  HAVE FUN!|`|vWOuX1d5aa	Ofcourse.<br>  <br>  I'm  young so i wont know,  But try and go back to school and study in your interest.|`|GZKbvXLLaa	I would suggest looking into some type of GED preparation program. These are offered at a few high schools where I live but obviously I wouldn't know about what is offered in your area. This would help you to prepare for the GED. I took it years ago, and I found it not all that difficult to pass the test. While it may be important at this stage of your life being young and all, later on - as you get older, it matters less and less. It has never posed any problems for me, nor has it been a barrier to employment. Believe me when I say that yes, it may matter now when you are young and have no real work experience. But, as you get older your employment history will be more important to a future employer than the fact that you didn't complete HS. Honestly? Once you have been working for a while, and established yourself in your field - they don't really care if you have a GED or a diploma. That's not even a consideration. Some people believe that not having a HS diploma is like the worst thing that could happen to a person. I disagree. Yes, I quit HS as well. Nowadays, I'm enrolled in a well known, reputable private University and I'm doing very well. I'll be graduating this year with a GPA of at least 3.90/4.0. And I have a great career going for myself that will only get better from here. What I'm trying to say is that not finishing high school is not necessarily the end of the world for you. You can easily make something of your life without it. Sure it may be easier for some people to do things the traditional way, like finish HS, then go to college. But, that isn't how it works out for everyone. The thing is this...Try to do something about it while you are still young. I'm not saying go back to HS. But at least get your GED, then go from there. Its all in your hands now. Try to make the most of it while you still can. And now is the best time because - I am assuming, you aren't married, nor do you have children - yet. Once those things happen - if they do, things like going to college will be much more difficult for you to do. Do these things now, and that way you are prepared for the years to come. If its cosmetology school that you really want to attend, then do whatever it takes to get enrolled into a reputable school as opposed to just any old one that will take you into their program. Research your options carefully, and thoroughly before making a decision about which particular school to attend. Try to get into the best program possible. <br>  Best wishes!|`|xujFt2oZaa	My parents dropped out of middle school and elementary and the reason was for to work and help their parents with the bill. They both weren't in school but their mentality is well thought,also have learned skills(English,cooking,fixing houses)etc. and have a descent job and maintain a family.<br>  I would get my GED(homeschooled) and apply to a cosmetology school.<br>  Cosmetology is a good skill because people will always want to look good and you can help them.Pain is now but pride later.|`|rXInAcURaa	be homeschooled.<br>  i hated my school, i asked my mom, i got a few books, it takes about 3 hours a day, you can do it whatever time you want, and you still get your highschool diploma. seriously, its a really good choice. that way, you can go ahead with cosmotology, and if you change your mind you can do anything, anything a high school student would do. <br>  <br>  <br>  please, do some research and save your future.|`|7d1bcd83d6c3611b6f659779f4f9e017aa	yea, go ahead and get your GED and apply. If you feel kinda bad about dropping, you might as well try your best to get in a school. good luck and hope you do well :D|`|gdGDvWTDaa	hmmmm. well im not in your position...but you need to figure out how to go back to school.  home schooling?<br>  internet options?<br>  or just suck it up and go back.<br>  <br>  its the only way to get into cosmetolgy schools
YCC3M43taa	when did you get it? if you got it recently this is normal. just clean it in the shower with dial antibacterial soap and move the ring in and out so it all gets cleaned. this is normal in the healing process. if its not recent, the only things you should be worried about is infection, or keiloids (which are red bumps at the peircing hole)|`|QPQdWsTOaa	Its probably infected, wash your hands before you touch your piercing.<br>  Clean it out with warm salt water, bactine, or h2ocean.|`|WtWxj4iFaa	It is completely normal. I had that for a long time after I got mine done. Use Microbial Soap. You can probably get it from the piercer or any drug store. Provon is the brand that worked best for me. Also, alcohol pads are good to use. Just clean it often enough!
I4Homaiaaa	Look at your face in the mirror, take a bar of soap, and trace the outline of your face. Take a step back, and that should be the general idea of what your face shap is. =) And there isn't a huge difference between oval and circle, just oval looks longer and circle sort of almost look like a square face, but a lot more rounded.|`|zkcOEU7jaa	with eyeliner, draw what you see of your face.<br>  also, I read in an article that oval shaped heads look best with almost any hair style (according to interviewed hair stylists and vote)|`|PxCMYmrwaa	I once read this in a book, You look in the mirror and draw around ur face in the mirror with lipstick(use an old one u wont need, you dont want ur new one messed, LoL). and then when u step away watever shape the drawing thing on the mirror looks like would be the shape of ur face.

You could get a cheaper brand dress on the egl sales community.<br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/egl_comm_sales" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/egl_com...</a><br>  <br>  The only thing is that most dresses come in one size .<br>  <br>  and Asiajam does not sell Lolita dresses.|`|hLdIO43Xaa	Here: <a href="http://www.sweetrococo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sweetrococo.com/</a><br>  <br>  I don't think many people in this category will be super interested in Lolita clothing.<br>  <br>  You can also try AsiaJam.com,sometimes they have cute dresses like that, I always buy from them.
AA10802032	Ray-Bans are beast!<br>  <br>  I have 3 pair, and mine are all real :)<br>  <br>  They are very in style.<br>  <br>  Many  movie stars wear them, and many sophisticated people in big cities wear them, so of course they are fashionable. One of my favorite artist(singer) wears them, lady gaga . <br>  <br>  But one tip is dont get the fake ones, because they look very cheap, and the orginal wayfarers are very classy. :)|`|d6CxF7RBaa	yeah they're wicked!|`|qqUhh5GUaa	of course,<br>  <br>  check this website out : <a href="http://www.wikishoes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikishoes.com</a>|`|vEApEfzoaa	why not its cute

q90ozSQ9aa	I totally feel where you're coming from, i need to get in shape for swim suit season, (;<br>  <br>  The nation is dividing into two camps: the fat and the fit, and neither is an hourglass shape. The fat, for obvious reasons, and the fit because aerobic workouts create androgynous figures.<br>  All that leaping about burns fat, but athletes don't get tiny waists and big hips, because they tone up everywhere. The least healthy option is to quit the gym (which creates a softer, more feminine, less bulky body - fast) and winch yourself into a corset. stop doing situps and start doing Pilates. Situps are good for creating a six-pack, but one look around the gym will confirm that they don't necessarily produce a waspy waist. Hope i helped!|`|RFPtIcx5aa	Hula hoop
hZtyekfWaa	Red bracelets are for anorexics and Blue are for ana / mia people.<br>  You make them yourself.<br>  I think it has to have a bead in the middle but i dunno.<br>  For you it has to be red!<br>  <br>  The rules are.. you have to wear it as offen as you can and you should no the rest.<br>  <br>  To people against this stuff - it's not your life! It's ours.|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	For a while there was a thing with DIY red beaded bracelets, so recoverers could find people to support each other. I don't know if they still do that. But most of the ones on Ebay are home made, and not much to do with pro ana at all (the charms are icky)... Go to hobbycraft/hobbybarn etc.<br>  <br>  And isn't it hard to have anorexia and bulimia? You either have the self-control or binge... <br>  Blah, its bad, you'll get hairy, and die, go get some help etc...<br>  <br>  But if you find an obvious one, expect to get flamed to hell for it.|`|Dvawm8Ezaa	It's one or the other. I don't think anyone has ever had BOTH. It's your decision though, I just didn't think there was any such thing as being both anorexic and bulimic.<br>  <br>  edit: if there's any type of purging I would say you have bulimia (but I would say it has to be quite often, a few times a day). I have known of some anorexics who have become so desperate that they have purged but only at very desperate times. If you just do not eat or eat extremely small amounts without throwing up, you're anorexic. I think you may be desperate, not quite bulimic.

zzp1o9mlaa	In order to achieve all of your goals listed, I would recommend doing the following:<br>  <br>  Focus on eating sufficient amounts of fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, lean meats, fish, poultry, nuts, seeds and legumes.<br>  <br>  Then supply your diet with the proper multi-vitamins for women.<br>  Vitamins essential for women:<br>  <br>  1.

You will not only look better but also feel better.<br>  <br>  Let me know if this information was helpful! :)|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Just eat healthy don't starve yourself<br>  && get the wii fit it really works :)|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	you can't get rid of stretch marks or scars.  They will fade over time.|`|yrkMVrbtaa	First off get your diet in check! Eat more veggies, drink more water, cut out sweets and processed junk in your diet. Walk at least 15 minutes a day, exercise! A good healthy diet will result in a healthy mind, body and soul. Secondly try Bio Oil for stretch marks and acne scars or Revitol these work wonders on stretch marks (I should know, I tried them!), as for the acne issue I would recommend using Pro Active or some kind of organic facial cleanser. Keep your hands and hair away from your face! All those dirty oils cause acne, along with not changing your pillow case every two days ( you know how dirty those things get?), along with washing your face daily. A skin regimen is vital. Don't pick at your skin! It's the worst thing you can do. As for hair go to a hair stylist and have them give some advice on what you can do to make you hair work for you ie: cut, texture, length, products to use. Get a dermatoligst if you can to get your skin on track. Best of luck.|`|FyAHNpQbaa	diets don't work b/c once you stop it, you'll gain the weight back. a lifestyle change is better. don't go on a strict diet. figure out how many calories you should be eating for your gender/activity level (the more active you are, the more calories are needed to function). track your calories everyday in a journal or on sparkpeople.com. start working out and being active. <br>  you can't get rid of stretch marks. they will only fade over time, but there is no way to get rid of stretch marks. creams don't work. if they did, nobody would have stretch marks.<br>  see a dermatologist|`|lBSyziruaa	Using cocoa butter on the stretch marks will reduce them. It worked on me very well. <br>  <br>  As for losing weight, just stay away from sugars and eat healthy and exersize. It always does the trick!<br>  <br>  I use herbal essances when I shampoo/condition my hair and it works so well.|`|uXFdeKGPaa	this is ure lucky day since am in a good mood ill give u sites at bottom.good luck|`|09yAU7iIaa	If you want to lose weight, I wouldn't suggest a diet, I would suggest a healthy lifestyle. You may want to regulate how many calories you eat in one day by starting Weight Watchers. If you don't want to go to the hassle or are unable to pay for something like that, you can always try the website caloriecount.about.com, which uses the same idea of counting calories, but is free. Furthermore, try incorporating an exercise routine into your schedule. Try going to the gym, starting a new sport at a community center or at school, or buying an exercise machine.<br>  <br>  To keep your hair silky and smooth, start by getting a hair cut to remove some of the damaged hair. From there, buy some hair products, like conditioning shampoo and leave-in conditioner, which will keep your hair super soft and smooth.  Also be sure to have proper nutrition, or perhaps look into taking a multivitamin. Your hair needs vitamins and minerals to stay healthy.<br>  <br>  Be sure to wash your face properly with a cleanser in the morning and before you go to bed. Stay away from oily and sweet foods like chocolate and chips, and also drink lots of water. If you keep getting pimples after that, buy an acne treatment that has salicylic acid or benzoyl  peroxide.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uRvO6PBpaa	■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■<br>  <br>  My dad had been suffering from hair loss and only recently he started to see a huge difference with his hair (lots of fine hair growing out especially at the temple area) after trying out the various natural techniques taught to grow hair for 1 week at this website <a href="http://www.regrowmyhair.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.regrowmyhair.info</a> <br>  <br>  I must say its a very informative, effective and easy to follow step-by-step guide.

You will need a belt, the wider and brighter the color the better.  If you're going for a costume reason then think "neon".  The braclet is a little 70's for me, maybe a chunky plastic braclet would look better in a brighter color.  Deifently no gold.  The sweater is fine with the leggings.  :)<br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  also, you will need some shoulder pads!  That would really set it off nicely!|`|VenYUtH6aa	I'd wear the top with the leggings and then find some new accessories. The skirt is cute but the top is long so it will not look good with the skirt - it would need a shorter, tighter top. The blue top is a little bulky for a belt and since it has the tighter bottom, It probably wouldn't look good. As far as accessories go, I would try multiple bracelets that are black and or silver or maybe some long chained necklaces. Wear flats or some peep toe heels.|`|SKpnhCunaa	i don't really like the skirt much.. <br>  but yahh everything else is cute<br>  does look 80's

Even the protective spray doesn't work. My hair falls out all the time, and I spend a fortune on deep conditioning treatments.  Thing is, I hate it all curly and bushy, even though my friends and boyfriend prefer it that way.|`|YFKxTNGeaa	I have very curly hair! Its a bit in ringlets, long and a little frizz. I'm in high school (11th grade now) and my freshmen year I straightened my hair every day. I didn't like my look when my hair was curly so I straightened it. I was very careful, so I used a very good hair care regime that did include heat protecting spray for when I straightened my hair. I straightened it so much that the ends of my hair stopped curling when my hair was wet. <br>  I ceased straightening my hair just last year and I can tell a dramatic difference from the look of my hair. Its a lot healthier that I stopped straightening it so much. Its not good to straighten it everyday even if you have a good hair care regime. My hair is really growing faster too because I'm not straining it with a flat iron anymore.<br>  You should stop for cut down on the hair straightening for about 2 months and I can assure you you'll see an improvement in your hair.|`|3KpyXDmlaa	No matter how much heat protection you use, straightening your hair every day will damage your hair. Especially since your hair is very curly, it takes a lot more heat for the hair to become straight than someone who has a slight curl to their hair. This will eventually leave your hair dry and brittle, along with lots of breakage & split ends. That damage will then make the process of growing out your hair much slower, & your hair will most likely not look very healthy. It also can take quite a long time to get your hair healthy again once it becomes damaged. I suggest that you don't straighten your hair every day. And if you really want straight hair all the time, the best thing to do would be to look into getting your hair relaxed, or permanently straightened. That would be a lot less damaging to your hair then straightening it day after day.|`|xliYPI7Vaa	omg i have the same problem but what ive heard is yeah it damages it alot and ur not going to be able to grow it out  i try to find nice ways to do my hair while its curly and striaghten it like once a week also u can take pills for ur hair that keeps it healthy also u can just get a prim but i dont recomend that because its also damages the hair an d ur probably gonna miss ur curly hair|`|hKR4MRCXaa	DONT PUT THE STRAIGHTENER ON HIGH!!<br>  lol<br>  but uhm u might need to wrap your hair every night if u want it straight and do it once a week (stay away from water)<br>  <br>  my hair used 2 be very curly until i straightened it every day now its BURNED straight..<br>  take my advice, if u want it straght<br>  get a relaxer..|`|62pCvaXGaa	I used to have it, ringlets, but I straighten them and now they don't bounce so much these days when they are curly. And no matter what type of hair you have they are going to damage if you don't use heat protection. Don't do it everyday!|`|yGabEjDMaa	I have super dooper curly hair - all natural.  I personally hate it on myself - so I straighten.  There are two products (that since I started using, my hair looks really shiny and healthy).  ION Heat Protection Spray (found at Sally's Beauty Salon) and Organic Olive Root Stimulator - the green can (found all over, I get mine at Walgreens)  I do not have ethnic hair, but this is found in the ethnic isle, and is great.  Do NOT use much of either though - your hair will get greasy looking.  I use the Organic Olive Oil spray (which will really help your hair grow) on my wet hair, and a light spritz when it's dry.  I use the ION on the ends, and a very very little on the top of my head.  I don't use it on every strand like the directions say too - way too much product, and greasy feeling.  Seriously - you're hair will improve, and you'll start to see it grow.  Using heat and straighteing every day WILL cause ALOT of damage to your hair, but these two products proved to be my life line when it came to dealing with the most un-coperative frizzy, dry curly hair in the world!!!  Good luck to you - I feel your pain with unwanted curls!|`|5ubWLH2paa	yes it is damaging for your hair, as it's being heated all the time and often becomes very brittle and dry. using hair straightened is like frying your hair. but now you can buy shampoo (i saw the advert for one buy head and shoulders called damage control or something like that, but others may be available). <br>  <br>  hope this has helped.

(I started dying it last month). My hair is very  thick, and soft. The other day I went in to get a fringe and my hairdresser said he was so impressed by how even my ends were. <br>  But my hair is sooooo thick and soft because I took a gene test and discovered that I was 99.9% Northern European and 0.0001% African (Ethiopian).

I just recently started getting the dead ends cut off my hair, and it does make a huge difference.  I go about every 5-6 weeks.  I do not have back ethnic hair, however - I found this product (usually at Walgreens for $4.00) and it's great.  It's in a green can, in the ethnic isle, and is called Organic Spray.  They have an orange bottle (which reeks in smell) and the green one.  The green can is a root stimulator.  Don't use much, or your hair will look greasy.  I use it right out of the shower when my hair is wet, and I spray it down a bit after I style it.  It really helps with straighting too!  I love this stuff.  My hair is (was) very dry and brittle, and someone told me just yesterday how healthy my hair looked.  I also use ION spray from Sally's Beauty Store.  It's the heat protector spray - I can't go a day without using it!!!  It too, can make your hair look greasy if you use too much.  I do not spray each individual hair before I flat iron though.  I lightly mist it on the ends of my hair.  When I'm in between cuts, and they start looking dry, ION is sooooo the product.<br>  Good luck.

Only you know what you really want, they can help you get there.|`|6juV48RWaa	uhmm i like it, but at the top, the blond highlights look a little messed up...and idk if its just her hair but it looks unwashed and oily...ew...go for it i guess.|`|RjCLLh6qaa	it looks like a big spider that just wont come off(:|`|0r3ceXnjaa	yuk. I don't think it suits anyone.
2ZsRAxkuaa	If not placed properly they can gum against gums, and cause gum recession, messing your teeth up pretty badly. Which is why its so important to go to a good experienced piercer, even if it is more expensive and means travelling.<br>  <br>  I have snakebites, and my teeth don't touch them at all, unless I'm wearing large jewellery. And occasionally if I smile wierd while eating, labrets can catch. But thats like.. once every couple of months.<br>  Although everyone assumes my chipped tooth is from them, I actually bit a rock :/<br>  <br>  You can also get special labret studs with a soft rubber-type backing on them, they're called "medilab labrets" And help cushion any blows to your gums.|`|2dya7YeKaa	Depends on your anatomy but it is best to assume that ANY oral piercing can cause problems with your teeth or gums.  That way you won't be dissapointed if they do.  Some people don't have problems with them, some people do.  It depends on the "setup" of your mouth.|`|AA11900006	Any piercing in the labret area is going to make your gums recede a little and this is because the stud is rubbing against them but it's not painful and can easily be prevented if you wear a lip retainer while you sleep... it's basically just a clear or skin colored lip ring that's a softer material and you can purchase them anywhere jewelry is sold.  I hope this helps :)|`|Z0ZDyIPkaa	i have two lip rings right next to each other and i wear a 16g labret ring in both. (the kind that are flat in the back.) i have bitten it a chipped my tooth once, right after it was pierced. but ive never had any other problems. gums teeth or anything. and its been like three years that ive had em. but mine hit my teeth and do not touch my gums. my friend who had a low labret took his out because his gums were thinning. i think it all depends on where they hit inside your mouth.|`|OJQqbIu4aa	i have had snakebites for almost two years.<br>  i visit an orthodontist every 5 weeks and a regular dentist every 6 months neither of them have mentioned any problems about my teeth or gums.<br>  <br>  <br>  i heard that too but as of now no problems for me|`|RmQFmGobaa	I have snakebites and I have braces.  I wear a ring instead of a post because i'm scared they might dig into my gums or ruin my braces.  But my orthodontist says its completely fine.  I cant even feel them anymore.|`|a3dce0605880850b6c3ecf557a2f663faa	They CAN make a real mess of your gums and your teeth.

I dont really wear white shoes. for the hat i prefer a slouch beret or something. <br>  <br>  When you destroy denims yourself- it works better if you use real paint rather than nail polish(all though you do get all the colors of nail polish at a cheap price) it stays better and doesnt look thick.|`|SKpnhCunaa	i like the outfit.. <br>  it wouldn't look good with a tight shirt as well<br>  you need to balance it out,,, tight jeans loosish shirt..<br>  loose jeans tight shirt..<br>  that's what my opinion is anyways <br>  anyways i like it all together =] cutee|`|jfiF9XIUaa	The only thing wrong are the ripped jeans either change the jeans to regular unripped or leave the ripped and wear flip flops of flats|`|jdxS3m7uaa	I Lovee Those Clothes!<br>  I Saw Her Pic In A Mag Wearing That And It Looks Soo Cool!<br>  And Especially Those Jeans !<br>  I Really Like Your Idea Of The 'Off The Shoulder' top Aswel! <br>  x|`|doha66YWaa	Love it, not sure about the rips though but whatever works for you :)|`|xpu4XgPXaa	i LOVE that outfit!

rIMP1M8Daa	if you have natural highlights, DONT DYE YOUR HAIR.<br>  im only fifteen and i made a really bad mistake by dying my hair!<br>   :(<br>  <br>  plus, if you want it long its gonna grow a lot slower.<br>  <br>  my advise is to keep your natural hair color, or really look for a dye thats not gonna do much damage. <br>  <br>  people always look best with their natural color.<br>  <br>  if you have a bad skin color that looks off with your hair THEN dye it.<br>  <br>  but by the description of your hair i wouldnt dye it.<br>  <br>  dye DOES take a while to come out:/<br>  and you most likely to loose all natural shine and lust.<br>   make a good choice if you didnt do it already, and good luck :D|`|710SJzEraa	don't do anything to your hair, you were born with the most flattering color for yourself. and rinse out dyes always leave a bit of color behind.|`|GIrGrwojaa	Do it!|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Yeah it sounds like a good idea to me :)|`|US2C6izEaa	show pictures, love.
WgQyGnrxaa	If you're doing it on yourself, just try to focus on your lashes when looking in the mirror.<br>  If someone else is putting it on you, look down and have them lift your eyebrow with their thumb and then apply it while you continue to look down.<br>  <br>  Hopefully that wasn't confusing at all!|`|qhKP68eiaa	(Got this trick off of What Not To Wear).  Put your thumb on your actual eye lid, being very careful not to smudge your eyemake up if you have already applied it, and pull up.  That pulls your eyelashes away from the eye while keeping the eye open.  Sounds weird, but check out Carmendy on WNTW, she does it all the time!|`|xDEYAUwGaa	I dont know really... just tilt your head up but keep look straight and put it on.  Thats how I do it and I dont blink.  Or put it on yourself, its always different when you do it yourself compared to someone else doing it.  Id blink too if my friend did it.  If you do it yourself, you have more control and know what you are doing and when you are going to do it so you just dont blink|`|XMmRjppjaa	maybe you can try closing your eyes and then doing it and then when you open your eyes, just use the tip of the brush to the do the bottom.
gZCReumRaa	my boyfriend likes curly hair unless it is too frizzy.... so i hope that helps|`|mDt03eXIaa	In my experience, guys like wavy/curly hair best. Every guy I've ever dated has said they liked my hair better curly, lol. For you, just look at what you think is more flattering and easiest. If it takes you a half hour every day to straighten your hair, but you think you look really nice with curly hair, why bother straightening it?|`|JzAMcMzlaa	I prefer a girl to be natural.. in that sense not wear any make up leave their hair as is and blah blah from there lol..basically be yourself.. that's the biggest turn on.. but i do like strait hair..so mix it up a bit if your tryna impress your parents and ur friends..one day wet your hair so its curly..the next straiten it.. its your hair and you should have a choice the way you want it to be..tell your parents that you fell comfortable with regular curly hair.. they are your parents..they should support you with everything you do.|`|kOHI6vl9aa	I have short curly hair and on my GOOD hair days i get compliments like boys saying i look *cough .. cute<br>  I think it depends really on whether or not they like straight, curly or straight hair. But it also depends on whether your hair suits you..|`|Xcs1USwvaa	try un curling it.  Sometimes that brings out the face.  Trust me girls that i meet with curly hair are not really pretty but when their hair is staight its a different girl!
ku5NPnkfaa	Rue 21 is like Forever 21 and they have guy clothes.|`|YF3uPqPfaa	i think guys need better style|`|Rz1MphsLaa	In forever 21 there are guys clothes sometimes just go on there website in the mens section<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forever21.com/heritage1981/mens/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.forever21.com/heritage1981/me...</a>|`|595d1d5602a5f3781434451850050ad5aa	yes ! <br>  forever 21 has a newer store they recently opened with the same style as forever 21 and around about the same prices its called "heritage"<br>  &<br>  h&m has similar styles as forever 21 for reasonable prices and they sell male clothes as well|`|ZcD578XXaa	maybe buckle?<br>  <br>  or like ed hardy?<br>  <br>  ummm try looking at your local mall's websites and they should have profiles on all their stores|`|lBSyziruaa	I do not think so.
yGabEjDMaa	I have thin curly hair.  I straighten it EVERY single day.  I LOVE my layers!  I have three lengths, and I had the top frame my face a bit.  I can either straighten it completley with a flat iron, or I use a curly iron to straighten it, and curl a few pieces - I get a ton of compliments on it.  My husband hates short hair, but is ok with the layers.  Layers will make your hair look fuller no matter how thin or thick your hair is.|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	no layerrs make yur hair thicker and volumise it x|`|Y5a3n1E6aa	It will make it thinner than it already is and might even look bald.  Do not do this.|`|89d3a6e56b7d9aa21477addbb9bad4c3aa	I have really thin hair too, but I don't straighten my hair (it's naturally straight)<br>  I also have layers, and they really do lift your hair and give it a bit more volume. <br>  If you have your layers at the front and back of your head, then it should give it more volume :) And when you come to blow dry it, start by drying the lower layers first, and work your way to the top layers. That'll give it even more volume!|`|ktyAqY81aa	My hair is very fine and sort of wavy/kinky - i also straighten mine all the time.  I've had layers put in my hair and it does add more volume, just don't get the layers cut too short.  The only thing i don't like about my layers is that they do make my hair even wavier because my hair as lost alot of the weight.|`|vdvD31uNaa	yeah
mJbwemH8aa	Avon they have a very good quality one and its not too much, try it and let me know.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|aUUHXC5Taa	hey have used Aveda, they say its natural But I highly doubt it.<br>  <br>  It moisturisers are harsh on skin and the smell tells that lots of chemicals been used in products<br>  <br>  SUKI is good, also Barefoot Botanicals|`|VTgGRzQAaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I would recommend you the cosmetics I use. Have you heard about Aveda? They make all their cosmetics from natural ingredients. I use the cleanser demaquillant 'all sensitive'. It gets the make up off your skin very gently and it is aroma-neutral. The cleanser leave on your skin a very nice light creamy feeling. You skin feels clean and very comfortable. <br>  <br>  I can also use the CHANEL PRéCISION product line. They all have a very nice smell and are very gentle to your skin.<br>  I use the GEL PURETé Rinse-off foaming gel cleanser Purity + Anti-pollution (I just love the smell!) it removes everything from your skin and gives comfortable feeling. Then I use a toner: Gentle hydrating toner balance + Anti-pollution.<br>  Only then I feel I have done something beneficial for my skin.<br>  <br>  I hope this will help you a bit :-)<br>  Cheers|`|Bwosoy7jaa	ok first of all you dont want natural you want something that says organic. any product can say natural and still have all the bad chemicals in them cause it is not regulated by the fda to use the word natural. but organic, at least 95% of your product has to be organic ingredients. I like the bust bees face wash the apricot scrub and the willow bark face wash. also the burt bees garden tomato toner is great. and burt bees products dont have many chemicals, always check a product out online. some products that say natural are ok but always check them out at this website www.cosmeticsdatabase.com. I keep on trying to go as organic as possible. Burt bees also has a good shaving creme and aftershave. but i dont like burt bees shampoo. For shampoo i just use a shampoo and conditioner bar. it looks like a bar of soap but works really good. the less chemicals the better. and anything with hemp in it is amazing. hemp soaps, anything it is on of the most potent plants on earth it has even been proved to cure cancer. just go as organic as you can also drink lots of water and eat your fruit and vegetables in a day. Also workout about 4 times a week, go to bed at a good time each night and stay positive and dont get stressed out. take a good multi vitamin and omega 3,6,9 also i take probiotics for my digestive. tea tree oil also works god on pimples. thats basically all i do. good luck peace.|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	You must go for Dr Hauschka face wash. Their products are completely natural and I totally love them<br>  <br>  I also use Suki cream, though I've heard its facewash is very good. Its a bit expensive, but worth it. All natural, organic and gentle to the skin
8QwZxRZKaa	Yes, colour damages hair because it has strong bleaching contents such as ammonia. If you like coloring your hair so much try to make sure the color doesn't get in contact with scalp and hair follicles. Try highlights rather than full color. More than 80% of the patients that come to me have damaged their hair from leading brands like L'oreal Paris and Revlon. It depends upon person to person that how soon the hair would get damaged once you get into colour addiction. If your hair was stronger in the first place then it might take months or years of coloring to see the begining of damage. It might damage your hair sooner if you had normal hair not as strong as that of the african decents.<br>  <br>  Forget all the rubbish products in the market. Throw away all your shampoos, conditioners and relaxers. They will only damage your hair further. What we do is we do too much to our hair. We curl it, straighten it, color it, comb all the time, try different shampoos... seriously its not something you can do experiments on. If your hair is healthy, color ot not, it would stand out.<br>  <br>  Now I tell you what to do. Please read this carefully. Buy yourself a johnsons baby shampoo. It is very mild so it would cleanse your hair without damaging it.<br>  <br>  For repairing your hair follicles and damaged tissue, take an egg white. Don't use the the egg yolk (it can make your hair really smelly)but don't throw it. Make yourself an omellete later. lol<br>  Just simply apply that to your scalp and hair. Leave it for 15 minutes. You will feel that your scalp is really breathing. Wrap a towel or any cloth around your neck to make sure if something drips it doesn't mess your clothes. After 15 minutes wash with johnsons baby shampoo. You don't need to wash your hair daily. Do this alternate days. Within 2 weeks you will start to see the recovery!! <br>  <br>  If possible, you should take some multivitamins for a month and try including some protein in your diet. <br>  Thanks for reading.<br>  <br>  P.S. Don't go on the TV commercials that promote hair products. If they would be really solve hair problems of people then one day their business would just close.|`|yGabEjDMaa	Your hair won't actually "fall out" unless you burn it - then, yes it can fall out.  I burnt my hair once, and the ends broke so far up on the scalp, that it looked as if it were "falling out".  really be careful and choose wisley on your color and the manufacture of that color.  make sure you deep condition, and they also make conditioners you can put in your hair before you color (that would be a really good idea if you color that much)|`|b2e5d1008f141778f2b5ab5e99078f48aa	nop<br>  <br>  if its with good name|`|QDl5owvNaa	Well yes it can cause your hair to fall out when it's very dry and so on.|`|DaVfyca2aa	No it will not make your hair fall out don't believe them theay don't know what theayer talking about.<br>   I've been dyeing my hair too and it's still soft and pretty.
jbGsNRh8aa	Of course.  They love to play with it.|`|hRH0tp7caa	hmm. i think straight hair curled looks lovely, especially on brown or blonde hair.a slight curl in the middle. it looks gorgouis girl. =)<br>  chris|`|PDY2F7PBaa	The boys better take what they can get. That's what I'm saying.|`|US2C6izEaa	i shure do(:|`|4XNwBll5aa	They will if you think curly hair looks better on you then straight i think u should try both and see what you like if u have curly hair and u straighten it and you like curly better then wash your hair and it will turn curly again but if you have straight hair and you like it curly then curl your hair but if u don't then don't curl it or if u don't know try Curling your hair and see if u like it whatever you like they will like on you :]|`|b2e5d1008f141778f2b5ab5e99078f48aa	on top if u r asking than YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  but down i prefer <br>  clean without any hair.......................................|`|ku5NPnkfaa	I think they like it when your hair is straight and you curl it but not so much when its naturally curly.|`|F0LgeWs5aa	I like the curly patch to be trimmed neatly.. OOPS wrong hair.<br>  Um yes Long curly hair is nice too.<br>  Short and straight because it pulls to tight to the head, short and curley.
ZFqz2DPRaa	Post a question on here, an i might just answer it ;)|`|oK9WhUkiaa	there is much more to someone than just 'looking sexy'. like personality. u must be the shallow type... those 'hot sexy guys' will only use u and play u. trust me.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Cleavge! If you happen to be flat chested, then quick dirty looks at the prvates will do the trick! :D|`|BGNdKvXzaa	Dress like a slut with the tightest outfits you can find. Wear too much makeup, show all your cleavage, and talk loud and dirty. You'll have soo much attention you won't be able to stand it.<br>  <br>  Now if you just want to enhance your beauty and image, that is another thing entirely.   You can be alluring without looking like a tramp.  Depending on your age, and where you will be going, you can wear some makeup and lipstick, without looking like the Late-Great Tammy Fae Baker. Wear a dress of skirt which shows your figure, with just a hint of thigh.  And wear some nice shoes, not uggs.<br>  <br>  But most of all, be nice, attentive, and conversant.|`|YF3uPqPfaa	don't beg.  normally i say beg and be desperate and stuff and want me bad.  but that's me and stuff.  if it's a girl i'm not trying to get to do that with me then i'd say don't beg.  don'tbeg|`|GKGQQaObaa	Don't wear a bra or panties and bend over to pick up your pencil in front of him. Also try letting your boobs slip out by accident and openly state that you're horny. That'll get him.|`|cZvAxNigaa	Just go into school naked<br>  <br>  <br>  Sure to catch his eye|`|a57c8c672f006f88f08496bd86f7caa6aa	Wear clothes that flatter your figue (e.g tight shirts, pushup bra, skirts, tight jeans), do your hair and makeup nicely, and be yourself. Don't act like a sl/ut or pretend to be someone you aren't though. It isn't worth giving up your individualism and/or virginity for a jerk who doesn't like the real you, so be careful.<br>  By the way, there's more to it than just looking sexy. Personality is a huge part of it, so keep a lookout for your type. Be nice, laugh at his jokes, give compliments, and show that your interested. He might come around to it.<br>  Be confident with who you are, stand up for what you believe in, stay positive, and love yourself. Guys like women with high spirits.<br>  And what I mean when I say to stand up for what you believe in, that means if he wants to pressure you into doing things you aren't ready for, don't give up who you are and give into pressure. That shows that you have no respect for yourself.<br>  Don't act desperate and go out with just anyone; wait for the right time to come. There's a right time for everyone. Good luck, hope I helped =]|`|Nupv5Uzlaa	Be yourself, be confident, be somebody they can respect (don't show yourself off if you know what I mean.)<br>  Have something interesting to say and don't forget to smile and make eye contact.<br>  <br>  Oh, or be funny and laugh at their jokes as well!|`|ypuvatS2aa	well find things you need improvement on! such as face ware makeup that fits skin color. try to go shopping find cloths that fit to the body only if ur skinny! if ur a little big ask 4 help because u dont want to look like a fat pig!|`|knQK17cyaa	sexy boys are  a waste of time and space.. go for the nerdier ones who are writting poetry in the coffee shops!|`|3Les3n24aa	Wear less clothing.
26b83612da17ca075f14a62fb1753da2aa	No I think they all closed.<br>  I think I remember seeing one in ann arbor downtown before but i'm not sure if it closed.<br>  Also downtown they have Urban Outfitters if that's anything similar.<br>  Yeah if you don't live in Ann Arbor like I do this probably isn't very helpful.
TcokFzjZaa	well i don't think that's to bad just ask|`|rFMRgHTdaa	So whats the question? Parents are like that because they don't want you to regret it later on in life or for your tattoo's to affect the way people look at you.|`|CQESMsV8aa	They are just smart. They know you will probably regret them in a few years. In my opinion, you shouldn't get any tattoo until you are old enough to get them without a parent's permission. You are too young...|`|ti8JXNz6aa	it depends on what age you are<br>  if you are over 18, even if it isnt the best decision it's your choice<br>  I got a tattoo when I was 13, i regret it.<br>  Even if you are over 18 and your parents dont approve, they are probably just trying to help you do whats best for you. A tattoo will be on you forever, the surgery to remove it is painful and more expensive then the tattoo.<br>  It also could give the wrong impression. i know eff the people who dont like it but there are gonna be people who get the wrng perception of it.|`|sfEE6hkGaa	Unfortunately, you will have to get a job in the future, and as much as we'd all love to own our own business or work for the coolest boss in the world, it usually doesn't happen that way. <br>  <br>  You've got all these ideas worked out, but think about the future.  All of my tattoos are easy to hide.  <br>  <br>  I won't mention my opinion of your ideas, but just rethink the placement of them.  The one on your stomach is fine, you're not going to work without a shirt.  But don't get tattoos on your forearms...  unless you plan to be a garbage man for the rest of your life or work in a detail shop... no offence to those people... but you seem young, and you probably aren't thinking of your future corporate career just yet, as I barely am myself!!|`|8FrUhGsNaa	because you will probably regret getting it. i just got one and even though i like it.. i already regret it. not saying you will but there's always a possibility.<br>  <br>  plus trying to remove tattoos cost soooo much money!|`|1fjhg6j4aa	If your parents didn't love you, they'd let you do whatever you wanted to with your body.  When you're 18, you can make those decisions on your own.
1xr6T6h0aa	Um, that doesn't matter at all.  There are no guidelines for models, and there are all types of models in all shapes, sizes, etc.<br>  <br>  Some really famous runway models have had moles (Cindy Crawford might have become famous because of her mole!)...<br>  <br>  Plus, photoshop and makeup can make freckles disappear if that is what is needed for the shoot.|`|a57c8c672f006f88f08496bd86f7caa6aa	It's possible. Contact a talent agency, send them your pic, and they'll be able to tell you if you're model material.<br>  It also helps to have a nice body.

ER8L9croaa	u will need forceps/clamps to hold the skin and a hollow needle to pierce it. i think navel rings are usually 14 gauge or something, so pierce it with a needle a size bigger to make it easier. <br>  ive never had mine done but ive seen my friend get hers done. they used isopropyl alcohol wipes to cleanse the area, then they marked it with a marker, clamped it and pushed the needle through. then they slid in the jewlery as they took out the needle. but make sure everything is sterile!!<br>  <br>  wash it with warm sea salt water after to prevent infection|`|Gbk293mxaa	Belly button piercings, just like other body piercings, require sterile surgical steel tools. They also require knowing the needle thickness to match the gauge of the jewelry being used.<br>  <br>  It's not like piercing your earlobe where you can just numb it and stab away.<br>  <br>  <br>  But think about this; piercing your belly button is essentially inflicting a puncture wound on your body. Know what happens to dirty puncture wounds?

olsdWxMbaa	nope, as long as you tell them what you really don't want doing to it like chopping it really short.<br>  <br>  if they're a good hairdresser they'll know exactly what to do to your hair, and they'll probably talk it through with you first too.|`|F6ZUiuXVaa	well its always best to take a picture with you and have them go from there<br>  <br>  everyone has different opinion's about everything<br>  and you may not like what they have in mind<br>  <br>  they have a thing of trying to convince you that is would look good or that would look good<br>  <br>  so its just best to take a picture with you of what you have in mind|`|IxWNkLtzaa	Ive just come back from a reputable salon, i had a consultation before hand, and the girl totally messed my hair up, i had to phone up, complain, go back to salon, get them to fix it, i would always trust a male hairdresser more so than a female,less bitchy,and that's a sad thing to say. Go with your gut instinct, what do you think, if your not happy Don't do it. Just because it is a pricey salon does not mean they wont mess up, they are still human after all|`|814295a990a619508cdc2fb420f9ef4aaa	No, not at all. First, tell the lady/man what you absolutely do not want.<br>  After that, it should be okay. They are professionals, after all. I had this done once, and wasn't so sure. I ended up loving it!|`|yGabEjDMaa	I did that once - HATED it.  Your choice though.  I'd at least ask the hairdresser to show  you some of his work.  If it's a really "pricey" salon, he'll have a portfolio with him/her.

Look at your own and see if there's any difference in colour/texture etc on it.

If not, buy an eyebrow pencil like everyone else. :)|`|QGU7JAIUaa	First off I would complain to the salon that she didn't do your eyebrows very well. You should never take hair off the top of your eyebrows. Best thing to do is to fill them in for the time being until they grow back. Eyebrow hair will only stop growing back if it is repeatedly plucked/waxed. x|`|QYbMxFE0aa	Yes it will grow back.  It is the first time it was done so your fine. If you did it all the time then decided you wanted to stop is when you would have the problem. As time goes on and you remove hair it starts to grow back less and less. So your fine. <br>  Until then get an eye liner that is closest to your color eyebrows and fill in where your hair used to be. :)|`|oXQKkmPYaa	Yess, They Will Grow Backk.<br>  My mom Has Been Drawing On HYer Eyebrows Since she Was 19 And Now She IS 32 And They Grew Back Fully.<br>  So Yes They Will Dont Worry.<br>  Also, You can Try And Filling Them In To Make Them Lookk Better.|`|2Urd6VLqaa	Yes they should grow back.<br>  It's hair after all :)<br>  <br>  In the mean time, try filling them in with an eyeshadow or pencil.<br>  <br>  ?|`|3RcMN0Ukaa	It'll grow back. It only stops growing if you wax off your hair for a year straight.|`|VLRZT9Foaa	Yes, they grow back... which is why you have to keep having yours done.

45jvOABwaa	I have oily skin and started using the FC5 lotion and I've been loving it!  I use the wash, toner, and eye creme from the RE9 - anti-aging - line.  But as soon as I finish up the wash and toner I'm switching to the FC5 (except the eye creme the RE9 eye creme has done wonders for me).  I also use just the Acne Lotion from the Clear Advantage line when I get pimples.  This combo seems to work well for me.<br>  <br>  The FC5 line is very new so there probably aren't too many reviews out there yet.  Here's the website in case you haven't seen it - www.arbonnefc5.com.<br>  <br>  Also there's a Preferred Client program you can sign up for to get 20% off all your purchases.  Let me know if you'd like more information on that.|`|a29qiNkvaa	I also was using the Re9 line and have changed to the FC5 line! I love it! It smells awesome and works better for me too! I also have acne prone skin! But my skin is very dry! So I went with the hydrating line and it amazing! The wash is like washing with lotion! I tried the oily/com skin one for a few days too and I also liked that one! I will use that in the summer and the hydrating one in the winter! <br>  <br>  I will say the clear advantage is also amazing that is what I use for months! The salicylic acid is from a natural source! Not a chemical! But of you don’t have acne then I would say go with the FC5 line! <br>  <br>  You will not find any review because this line only came out the first of Feb!
yGabEjDMaa	Not sure if it will work, but you can try this thing Walgreen's has.  It's a bush you use in a circular motion to remove hair.  It looks like sand paper but is pretty soft to use.  I use it on my chin (lol).  I can't remember what it's called, but it's an "as seen on tv" deal.

i8AeUoKbaa	Wash your face every day but be very gentle with it.  What you wash it with isnt really that important but preferably something with a bit of roughage in it that will clear of dead skin cells and dont use soap.  Moisturise too.  Also sweating is great for cleaning out pores and exercise will help to make you feel happier which will reduce stress which can be a factor.  Change pillow covers frequently - I found this helps prevent new spots forming.  Drink lots off water and eat healthy - beetroot is very good for your skin.<br>  There are also effective creams like benzyl peroxide which works very well.  More info on using benzyl peroxide at www.acne.org.  The clear skin regimen there is great.<br>  <br>  The key point really is just treat your skin well|`|1JsWMX0daa	drink 8 cups or more of water a day. a coffee mug full of water is a little over a cup. eat at least an egg a week. wash your face with soap and cold water every morning & evening. flip your pillow every night and change your pillow case often.|`|M1u6fdZCaa	Exfoliate, moisturize, and drink plenty of water.|`|8jY4JUw7aa	any thing healthy one gallon  every 24 hours  moisturizer|`|nBaRuZ5xaa	*Drink at LEAST 64 oz of water each day to maintain hydration in the body and purge toxins regularly. <br>  <br>  *Quit smoking. <br>  <br>  *Don’t forget to moisturize. <br>  <br>  *Blend your makeup to make it look more natural. <br>  <br>  *Wear brightly colored clothing to distract from nasty pimples. <br>  <br>  *Wash your face after sports or exercise.

HlOjmGXRaa	I work at a tanning salon and some people are allergic to the chemicals that we use to clean the beds. For those customers we always wipe the bed down with water before they get in so they don't break out. Be careful about eye wear as well because they are cleaned with similar chemicals. I would try to wait till the dermatitis has cleared some. If you don't at least skip the lotion to allow it to dry out. If you have changed lotion recently check that to. It could be causing the irritation.|`|bacf6df503bae1003891ca7a81e36298aa	Just take your own wipes in with you but not until your dermatitis has gone.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Some medications can make you more sensitive to UV rays, even if it doesn't say so on the package as a major warning. I'd stay away at least until you finish the medication.|`|oojO4WAraa	Did the doctor mention how bad tanning beds were for your skin and how they seriously raise the risk of skin cancer?  <br>  <br>  You could wipe the tanning bed off with a wet towel before you lay on it.  <br>  <br>  I don't think it would be good for your skin to expose it to tanning rays until you are finished with the medicine and the bumps are gone.  But I'm not a doctor - so maybe you should call up the doctor's office and ask the nurse.   Good luck.

As it grows in, the hole will shrink, which is why it hurts to put back in piercings... once it's back in, when you hit something, it's much more sensitive.<br>  <br>  I guess the Men's Health section has more problems with earrings than women? haha<br>  <br>  Edit: I had piercings that were in for YEARS, and when I had to take them off for sports, they eventually closed up completely even when I was taking them on and off.|`|Dfeemjagaa	your ears have not healed yet. i suggest getting a pair of real gold studs and leaving them in for a few months to a year. it's better to stop messing with them before you get an infection, oh and use neosporin(antibiotic cream) every day and every earring change.oh and wash your hands before touching your ears.|`|Ja7M7JKhaa	have u been wearing earrings lately??<br>  <br>  if not then that could be the problem. put ice on ur ear and then stick the earring in. <br>  <br>  its not infected or anything becuz i used to have that problem. <br>  it happens to everyone somtime.<br>  <br>  or are u pushing to hard when u wanna get it in?|`|WM7StKDTaa	you could have an infection just keep earrings out of your ears for a few days and clean your ears with alcohol and it will stop hurting. my left ear did the same thing last month|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	you could have an infection. put alcohol in it. (cleaning alcohol, not drinking. but it might help. don't try it, though.)|`|OtWnDh79aa	You could possibly be allergic to the metal. Try a different type of metal.
wErHwAXqaa	My dermatologist has actually suggested only showering every other day. Showering TOO much and/or using harsh soap can dry your skin out, but showering only a couple times a week will make most people's skin incredibly oily, therefore giving them bad skin.|`|OtWnDh79aa	Yes. The oil from your sweat will cause bacteria to grow and will cause acne. It is healthy to shower every day. But if you don't, at least wash your face every day and wear deodorant.|`|H8xCk7X8aa	Dead skin will build up and the creases will turn darker.  So it would be bad for your skin.  If a person can only shower twice a week i recommend they exfoliate very well on those lucky days.|`|J1kJb98Maa	you need to clean your skin every day <br>  if that means you get hosed off with a bar of soap in your hands or you take a bath in a bucket you need to be clean for your general health and for your skins health|`|AA11625446	You need to shower every day.|`|a57c8c672f006f88f08496bd86f7caa6aa	EDIT: Sorry lol. Well that person will be rather stink if they shower only twice a week. They should be showering every day! It's called Personal Hygiene.<br>  Also dead skin will build up and the creases will turn darker. So it would be bad for your skin if you didn't shower often.|`|TR5ntsavaa	Yes. If someone isn't showering regularly and getting rid of all the sweat and oil, they'll get acne, not to mention smell bad. Especially if they're active.|`|WqMHYfPfaa	so I guess you don't shower, that is sick. But yea, shower everyday!!|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	that's gross. why would you do that?
387493774383e79967205158ff9bb074aa	Try eating more citrus fruits, that always helps my skin for some reason.<br>  What I find is most effective is to eat oranges or grapefruit first thing in the morning before anything else, then wait for 30 mins after to eat breakfast so you've digested the fruit before you stick other food on top of it.<br>  Try it for a week or two and see if it helps. <br>  I'd be interested to know if it helps other people as much as it has helped me.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	I tell you the best thing to do, to swim in the sea, salt water is the solution.
uFOO6Cryaa	by the time you typed this you should have just tried them on...it depends on the length of your legs..measure them then go online and get the specs for levis|`|CjvXSZuXaa	you should get short.|`|S1CLLs4Laa	who cares if u dont wanna try them on do it anyway
apALY0sqaa	Honestly, as high as you want. Deeper set eyes, you might want to go higher up so it can be seen. I wear mine up to my eyebrows, obviously NOT like Mimi from Drew Carey. it can vary on the mood you're in, the color, your eye shape and set, time of day, ect.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=183566922&albumID=632843&imageID=20428596" rel="nofollow">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...</a> <br>  <br>  This is how I tend to wear my everyday make up. I wear the prime/main color up to the crease of my eye, then I blend a different color(s) into the actual crease, so it goes just above it, from there I usually use a neutral shade and blend from the shading up into the bottom of my eyebrow so it looks smooth and blended over the entire eye area. But again, it's just a matter of style and opinion.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Well that's up to you check out youtube.com for eyeshadow tutorials for help. I but a med Color on the lid and a darker on in the crease. This all going just above the lids. The the brow bone down which is the eyebrow and down to meet the other colors I use a highlighter. It is a lighter color to blend.|`|z6ewtQubaa	Usually the color goes up to the crease and then the highlighter (usually a light color like white) goes on your brow bone.|`|xDEYAUwGaa	Ususally you get a highlighter shade and apply it to the brow bone, then get a medium shade and apply the eyeshadow on the lid up to the crease.  Then you apply a darker shade to the crease. Blend it a little and your eyes will look great|`|39X8e50Raa	well thats  up to you depending on your preference but i usually just put shadow in the crease of my eye and on my eye lid    and occasionally  a really light colour on my brow bone to highlight my eye|`|TR5ntsavaa	I use a light shade on from my lash line all the way up to my brow line, and a darker shade from my lash line to the crease. That's what I learned from looking up makeup tips online and what my Mary Kay lady told me.|`|Dghr9r3vaa	I always put mine up to my brow line...sexy!
5j1Uhg2Gaa	Its the cream you are using, that is what is clumping it up. Use something that is sticky instead of creamy. They have stuff to put on before you eye shadow to keep it from clumping and help it stay on. You only want to put a thin layer on or it will start clumping too. Go to any store like Ulta the they will sell it. I forgot the name of it but just ask them for something to help keep eyeshadow on. Its the same stuff that they use in eyeshadow sticks.|`|yIRcd5X8aa	Use an eyeshadow primer, you can get a good one from ULTA or SEPHORA|`|apALY0sqaa	The primer/"cream" you are using may be too heavy, or the eyeshadow/cream maay be no good or cheap.<br>  <br>  Apply a lighter layer of the cream first to see if that helps. If it doesn't, I would suggest a better primer or eyeshadow, or even both. If you don't mind the price, MAC is a great brand. It's a bit expensive, but it has a much longer life than covergirl, max factor, ect- so the price averages out in the end.|`|Q4QgXqIRaa	i know it sounds crazy but put chapstick on your eyelids before you put on your eyeshadow, it really does work.|`|f6f123d1de5cfc1006bad11b8d6e757aaa	well if its cheap it'll do that.<br>  but use chapstick or foundation on your eyelids.<br>  thats what i do.
AA10343094	that really depends on the pattern of the dress. i think mine was 7 3/4 yards. it will say how much you need on the back of the pattern package so that before you even open it, you will know how much you will need.|`|jH4JAEeRaa	it all depends on what size you are, and your height, but im guessing that around 3yards or so would probably be sufficient.
CASwFr7kaa	Wow your Pretty. And yes most definatly they'd be bangin haha.<br>  But not too thick and right below your eyebrows is what you should tell the lady.|`|aTQLKBR3aa	i think you just like posting this picture around to look for attention. I don't even know if you really are this girl because the last time you had a pic up you were a completely different person. (the blonde) but no bangs would make you look emo.|`|oRcrQoToaa	definitely with your face shape and really nice hair it would look great, i think you should get it to your left and have it just reaching half way down your ear, i think it would look fab|`|T95c191eaa	only if you get layers<br>  and your eyes are SO pretty<br>  you should use mascara<br>  oh and always leave the bangs out of a ponytail.|`|byifpEPqaa	Yeah I think so. :)<br>  If you don't like them you can just pin them up anyway.|`|YNgkRwRZaa	yes they would suit you very well with the color of your hair.<br>  Straight bangs would also suit you well too!|`|uLXS2VKOaa	yes! <br>  bangs would look good on mostly girls and u have a nice shaped face.:]|`|WXqOBE2Maa	that would look very pretty:)|`|9qIk1uqyaa	i think you should get bangs..but the kind that covers the whole forehead, i think that would Look cute on you. but its up to you whatever you feel comfortable with.|`|E9d5Hz3laa	No don't! Seriously, get normal bangs. Your eyes r rly pretty and bright, it will make em pop , and it would sute your faceshape, side bangs are so over worn and getting kinda ugly, not to mention it would look kinds repulsive on such a haircolor like yours, if you do get sides, dye your hair more of a bold color mybe|`|YL8tTemwaa	Why would you want to change such pretty hair?|`|boqBDDGlaa	Yeah, I think it would suit you.  Here is a pic of the type of sidebang I think you should get:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/famecrawler/lauren_conrad-cc.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/famecrawl...</a><br>  <br>  Except your hair isn't blond ahaha.   <br>  <br>  Hope I Helpedd (:|`|K4bJgTF4aa	yuck no.  i think you should cut your hair to frame your round face, and layer it, oh and highlight it.   you have pretty hair and a pretty face so accent that.  no side bangs.|`|FVWvN07xaa	Get a bag instead.|`|HKui8pyMaa	your a different person every question arent you ?
vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  It depends as girls get tired of long hair and girls get bored with short hair.  Some girls want a change so they cut their hair and see what it looks like. Others want to grow their hair and see how it looks on them.<br>  So it does not matter short or long.  The person has to like it and feel good about herself.  Whether it is short or long.<br>  Hair can always grow back if you decide it does not suit you.|`|FJswVeqbaa	huh..confused|`|oRcrQoToaa	well my aunt has had short hair since she was 20, she cut it but had kinda layers and got blonde, brown and red, i think if it is a nice colour or even a mixture of colour it looks hot, the only way it could make someone look way older if it was cut to a shape which doesn't match their face shape, if you're thinking of getting it done you should think about asking your hairdresser what short cuts would suit your face shape, i really hope this helped

wzxmWDs4aa	It depends what you want your eyelashes to look like.<br>  If you like to have your individual lashes coated, then this mascara is not for you - it fuses your eyelashes together so you have one big eyelash!! But it does give you an amazing wide-eyed look, and it's also very dark. I really love it, and if you own an eyelash comb it's not too bad. You can get it from Macy's, Bloomingdales or Sephora.<br>  <br>  BUT if you want the individual-eyelash-I'm-not-wearing-<br>  any-mascara-look then I would definately go for the new vibrating estee lauder mascara, or any of their mascaras. Bobbi Brown also do a really good one. Go to the mall and go to each stand and ask them to try it on you - free makeover!!<br>  <br>  However, if you want a mascara that does BOTH your first choice should have to be Yves Saint Laurent VOLUME EFFET FAUX CILS.

It isn't a natural look. People have asked me if I have fake eyelashes. I also buy a seperate mascara for my bottom lashes because it's a bit too much for the bottom for me.<br>  It is so good though and worth the money I think.<br>  I live in Australia, and here you can only buy it in a few department stores, not just anywhere down the mall.|`|qroOTyrGaa	It really give good lengthening and thickening but it can irritate the eyes because it does contain fragrance.

I would never get surgery done. You get it done once and you get addicted to it and do it over and over again and again. It is never ending.

It just seems totally wrong when people consider it for cosmetic reasons. I guarantee you that with the right fitness routine and correct nutrition you will look the way you want and also more importantly feel great about yourself. I think you should seriously give that a shot. Go to Maximuscle website for all the right information on fitness and nutrition. Their really good. Hope this has helped. : )|`|Ey5ew3G6aa	no. i hate it when people have plastic surgerey. it cost thousands of dollars that aren't worth it. if you want to get it, it's fine. it will not be my breast getting a augmentation.

qxrr69bnaa	I've gotten some excellent results from lotions that sell for less than $20 at my salon.  I've used Mind Eraser from the Caribbean Gold line by Australian Gold.  Australian Gold and Designer Skin make some excellent lotions.  I've also used Intrigue by Designer Skin and I like their Enamour moisturizer.<br>  <br>  Of course they're trying to push those expensive lotions at the salon.  That's where the salon owners make their profits.  <br>  <br>  If you use 10 minutes/tan that's 30 days worth of tanning.  I'd start out 2X a week for about a month,  then go once a week for 15 minutes until you use your minutes up.<br>  <br>  I tan once a week for 12 minutes in my salon's premium bed.  I like to keep my tan year long.|`|6juV48RWaa	Yes i agree with Whitney, just stick with the Emerald one. and no, the results are not permanent. Tans go away when you stop tanning. Moisterize as much as possible to prolong the life of your tan.<br>  Happy tanning! :)|`|tikvyGGpaa	I work at a tanning salon. Those lotions are great and they probably will tan you better but I would stick with the 30 dollar lotion.
essd1DYWaa	I like to use a light neutral brown, or maybe a medium brown. Always go with a neutral if you are doing it yourself.|`|CgAjOgWwaa	.

L6kIV3Liaa	cut the crap you know you're cute. <br>  <br>  Millions of women pay millions of dollars every year to get curly hair. I wish I had your problem. Mine's frizzy but so straight it won't hold a curl. If it's frizzy try a little bit of leave in conditioner. Not to much it will weigh your hair down and look greasy. deep condition in the shower a couple times a week.

3s4gEk1Maa	Yeah, you are a minority.<br>  <br>  Most redheads have very light skin, and because light skin is caused by a lack of melanin (the component that determines skin color and that when present in greater concentrations results in darker skin), these people usually have a harder time tanning. <br>  <br>  I guess you're just really lucky.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	My son's auburn-haired, and he tans well, but true carrot-tops and strawberry blondes don't...they have less melanin in their skin, and they're fairer-skinned than the people with darker red hair.<br>  <br>  So count yourself lucky...but go easy on the tanning and wear sunscreen. You don't want to get skin cancer.|`|QDS9ncqqaa	there is a difference between red heads and gingers.<br>  red heads can be hot<br>  <br>  gingers are pale, freckly and practically allergic to sun lulllzzzz<br>  <br>  ewww you have ginger pubes|`|DilBAALxaa	red heads have got less colour pigment in their skin so its usually harder for the skin to darken but in your case your lucky lol x|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Most redheads burn really easily...you are lucky!|`|jD1JY0BJaa	You're a daywalker?|`|9xUTkhgoaa	Thats great, do you have freckles?|`|GVTASdlYaa	coz they dnt ...|`|Bl3ShphHaa	the reason why so many people say redheads dont tan easily is because in majority they dont. having red hair is a trait of being irish, and people with irish background tend to burn very easily and have pale skin. <br>  However, if you have mixed genes, such as if perhaps your mom is irish and your dad is italian, you will tan very easily. that is just an example.|`|441GSyaMaa	Isn't it something with the genetics and the pigments in the skin? Normally if you have red hair you normally have more of a pale skin (as well as having fairer skin), the darker the skin is the easier it is to tan.<br>  <br>  I think you're one of the lucky ones :-P|`|D0JsiC0Paa	Lol, there might be a bit of blonde in you - <br>  <br>   But you haven't DYED your hair red by any chance have you? That would explain quite a bit.<br>  <br>   And generally red-head people tend to have very little melanin in their skin, the pigment which in varying degrees gives the spectrum of 'colour' or tan and isn't really present in great heaps in people with a fire top, in other words - they're WHITE!<br>  <br>   Guess you just got a nice mix of genes in you.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	Well obviously some redheads do tan, I don't think people say never. <br>  <br>  Tanning is all to do with the amount of melatonin in the skin. Generally speaking people with red hair and pale skin tend not to have much melatonin, but yes of course there are exceptions to the rule, of which you are one :)|`|AA12196905	tanning is burning!<br>  <br>  apparently tanning is your skin cells in truma trying to protect themselves from skin cancer which is as bad as burning.|`|ysFlJqILaa	If it is auburn hair, or dark red, they do tan, but not strawberry blonde.|`|3Z9npp2maa	Why do they need to? Light skin is hot. Tan is definitely not popular with guys these days.

AtjlmByAaa	Hi, I suggest you use "tea tree oil" facial wash, its good even for sensitive skin, at also has anti bacterial, regular use will prevent fine lines and dark spots.|`|naySyzfQaa	It's not listed but, for me it's Aveeno|`|5wAAnZPYaa	Pure water.|`|nBaRuZ5xaa	<a href="http://about.pricegrabber.com/search_getprod.php/masterid=701542627/search=Dove%20Essential%20Nutrients/st=query" rel="nofollow">http://about.pricegrabber.com/search_get...</a><br>  <br>  i use dove too. it works for me. i think you should try different ones and compare the results. then you can find which face wash is best for YOU. hope i helped! :]|`|TzFIWoNcaa	everyuth is the best one to use because it makes your skin soft|`|l62gZcMEaa	well  i use the dove ,that also imported|`|jcFJHrTyaa	i use clean and clear because as we apply it on or face it becomes dry and after washing the face freshnes comes on my face and i look more fair.|`|18ZnsnFYaa	I THINK ITS DOVE.BUT I M WARNING U NEVER USE EVERYUTH.OK.but the best is nivea.forgive me for the spelling.its costly but u know,u cannot play with ur skin.am i right??????|`|6615kXGLaa	himalaya|`|iK9BSIH2aa	i think neutrogena is the best it makes sure the skin stays smoothe for a long time|`|uA5lDqiVaa	I use clean and Clear. and My face looks amazing.|`|HNNckfP3aa	I think the best face wash is Dove.

Not to mention it is sticky as hell in most cases. And, I am sorry, a girl that is constantly applying lip gloss in public either can't put it on right the first time, is wearing cheap stuff, wants attention, or is 13. None of which I am or want to be accused of!<br>  <br>  And, if lipstick is worn correctly, it looks great, doesn't wear off like gloss, and you can kiss your man without you both being covered in sticky red goo!!!!!!|`|Nupv5Uzlaa	I wear chapstick with a slight hint of color.<br>  I like to look more natural and I'm taking good care of my lips in the process.<br>  <br>  What are those fake lipgloss wearing girls thinking?|`|a57c8c672f006f88f08496bd86f7caa6aa	I always wear lipgloss.

All you have to do is capitalize the first letter of every sentence and you're good.<br>  <br>  Just condition your hair often if you have fried hair from dying it, that's the best you can do. You could also get a hot oil treatment for your hair, it will replenish some of the shine =]<br>  <br>  By the way, you should use hair appliances every time you shower. If you don't then it's not good for your hair. If you want it to get better then shampoo and condition it often.<br>  <br>  By the way DON'T dye it anymore. Even though you might want to, I guess you'll have to live with the color you have. If you dye it a lot the hair will start breaking off and falling out. It's not good. And try to let it dry naturally most of the time, blow drying it isn't very nice on the hair.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped =]|`|eEN9bkgQaa	You should try glazing your hair. It conditions it but it also makes it shiny and smooth :)|`|l6s1DMB6aa	You just need some proper hair maintenance for healthy hair, no more damaged hair and proper products will enhance and prolong your highlights. You will notice a difference immediately (and so will your friends) by using these products, they are natural minerals plants-protein and olive oil and will leave you with no damage, healthy, silky, shiny and manageable hair. Read more on HerStyler hair care products at <a href="https://www.infashionsense.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.infashionsense.com</a> (or to go directly to the herstyler page visit <a href="https://www.infashionsense.com/herstyler..." rel="nofollow">https://www.infashionsense.com/herstyler...</a> and just hit 'back to store' to shop around after you get your facts). I'd invest in the hair care line using shampoo and conditioner daily and definitely the mask (deep conditioning treatment) you will know how often you need to use it based on your hair type and absolutely the hair serum before using any styling tools to prep hair for styling and manageability. They are economical because you only use a tiny amount so they last a very long time. I don't know if you use styling tools at all also, but you may want to read more about the 100% ceramic & tourmaline irons and tourmaline dryers, by using natural heat and iron plates you will maintain healthy hair (get rid of conventional damaging styling tools). After 42 years of trying every cheap and expensive hair remedy i found these products - they are fantastic! I hope this helps!
tzRCTQ6Xaa	Use the concealer first, then let that dry.  Next, put on your foundation using a soft sponge.  After putting on your foundation, it's good to use a pressed powder to keep the shine off.  Add a little blush to your cheeks, that will help give a soft look.<br>  Be careful not to choose colors that are too light or too dark for your skin color.  You want to look natural.<br>  Good makeup that is not too expensive would be Avon or Revlon.|`|TR5ntsavaa	Instead of a foundation to cover up any "red bits," you might want to try a concealer.

I use the one from dermalogica. Joe Blaso also makes a red away concealer if you would like to try that as well. You also may be exfoliating too much. Try to cut it back to every other day. To much exfoliating can be harsh on your skin and cause more redness. That's ok that your from Scotland you can get Dermalogica there. Plus there are sites that will ship Joe Blasco to you. I know our salon does that. Cuttininn.com  (if your interested) but shipping can get high so I would recommend Dermalogica definitely. I would go with a powder foundation and I would recommend using the Dermalogica oil free matifyer.
hnhb119Laa	GQ really is still the leader.  Men's Vogue seems a little too tied to their advertisers, Details is too young, trendy and aimed toward gay men for my taste.

Dermatologist specialize in skin.  The Dermatology department is usually referral only.  That means you have to have a visit with your regular doctor first and get a referral from them.  After that you will be able to make as many appointments as you want with the Dermatology department.  Make an appointment,  I would do that rather than relying on yahoo answers.

l3OWdPo5aa	that is too dangerous + too risky + it can cause pain...<br>  for the pain: try some ice<br>  for the piercing:try it with a needle which has been cleaned carefully.<br>  <br>  plzz note that belly piercing is very very dangerous to do yourself..<br>  if you really want a piercing , try one on the lips. It's very easy to do it yourself.And not risky|`|BLLdUrWVaa	What you Need:<br>  1. A sterilized 14 to 16Ga Piercing needle.<br>  2. Belly Ring<br>  3. Neosporin<br>  4 Cotton Balls<br>  5. Gloves<br>  6. Q-tips<br>  Fist wash your hands. Then put on gloves. Make sure you have all the things you need close. Use a cotton ball to clean the area with alcohol. Hold the flap of skin you want pierced. Press the piercing needle through the skin clear through to the other side.(Dont slant it just take it staight through.) With the needle still piercing the skin, put the belly ring through the hole behind the needle as you remove the needle. Once the needle is out attatch the ball to the belly ring. Then use a q-tip to put Neosporin on both sides of the piercing.<br>  Healing Time: It takes around 3-6 months to heal. For some it takes 12 months or more to heal. It depends on how well you take care of it.<br>  CLEAN TWICE A DAY UNTIL ITS HEALED<br>  1. Wash your hands before you clean it. Dont touch it other than to clean it. <br>  3. Clean it with antibactirial soap like Dial or Soft soap. <br>  5. Pat it dry with cotton or q-tips. <br>  DO NOT USE ALCOHOL TO CLEAN!!! It dries the out the skin.|`|EKesa3cbaa	Ok well there no garantee that it wont get infected or anything but i pierced my friends belly botton.<br>  this is how you do it..<br>  <br>  <br>  you need to get quite a big needle and sterilize it by putting it in boild water for a few minutes and then get a peg and some ice... now sit down and put the ice on your bely botton unil its numbed (this will take about 5 mins) after its numbed put a peg to the side of where you want to pierce the hole.( leeve the ice on while doing this) get the needle (but dond touch the end with your fingers cos thats the piont of steralizing it.<br>  now the hard part. its gonna hurt but only for a split second and im not going to say it wont...just pierce it straight away dont dither about like some people do cos thats wors just dont be scared and poke it staight though.. now dont take it out and leeve it for a while cos it will try to heal and you dont want that so just take it out and put the pierceing in. <br>  <br>  GoOd LuCk!!<br>  <br>  <br>  ??I Hope i helped??|`|Pefb1Amfaa	DONT DO IT! it could go seriously wrong because your belly button is in the same place as parts of the body you need to survive! go prefesionally, its better, and less painful! probably cheaper in the long run.|`|RikCftYKaa	DON"T DO IT!!!! you could do it wrong and disfigure yourself.|`|vMYLTypKaa	Try piercing your eyebrow.  I hear there is no risk in that!|`|qT9PULiKaa	get your metal bb ring from a local beauty supply shop, like sally's or i think walmark carries them...make sure it's made out of something you're not allergic to.  Sterilize it by dropping it in boiling water and then letting it cool...and be sure to do the same thing with the needle you're going to use.  Make sure the needle's the same gauge as your ring.  Get a can of soda from the fridge, got to be really really cold, hold it on your belly button for a few min, until you're numb. Pierce. It helps a lot if you have a circular ring, the type you put the little ball bearing in to hold it in place, and if the needle's curved...that way you can just lead on the ring from the end piece of the needle and get it thru that way.  It's going to hurt quite a bit b/c you're doing it yourself, and you're going to be waaaaaay slower than anyone who actually knows what they're doing, but it can be done.  Be sure to wash your hands and belly button area before you go at it, expect to be nauseous after you've done it, and dont use alcohol to clean it with after you do it, that'll make it bleed.   Best thing to take care of it after you've done it is the same stuff they use for newly pierce ears, you should be able to get some at walmart.<br>  Have fun.<br>  <br>  Oh, ya, if you have some sort of little clamp you can use to hold the skin you're going to pierce, that'll help too, the flatter the skin is the easier to pierce.|`|defzWOvMaa	omg are u sure u want to do it urself? what if u do it wrong or get an bad infenction? i mean something can go wrong at a professional place but u can sue them...dont do it

KPNTniA1aa	warm water opens pores. cold water seals pores. wash your face with the hottest water you can handle (use a washcloth and water or a facial scrub). when your done, splash your face with the coldest water you can handle. this closes the pores. apply a moisturizer with spf in it. this protects you from the sun and makes it easier to apply makeup. your face should be a little bit wet when you moisturize. not dripping wet, but not completely dry. try to find a good balance.<br>  i don't think you'll be prone to breakouts if you put makeup on right after washing your face. just be sure to take care of your skin.<br>  <br>  hope this helped! :)|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I wash wait a minute moisturize wait another minute then  apply primer then foundation.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	After u wash your face you aply moisturizer and then you wait 15 min to aply makeup

oRPvkExwaa	I'm growing mine out too! I would suggest regular trims, every 6-8 weeks, or whenever your ends start to look shaggy. I think blow drying and straightening are fine as long as you use a good conditioner! Not the drug store conditioners though, go to a salon and get a good one that suits your hair type, or for long hair. Also, prenatal vitamins help your hair grow much faster, so the damage isn't as lasting.|`|CoDUHl7Uaa	I have hair that is 12 inches past my shoulders.. i use a hair dryer every morning, i really recommend dove shampoo and conditioner, pantene shampoo and conditioner.. and a straightener can sometimes do your hair good!! i haven't gone for a trim since October.. only need one when you start to get split ends and long layers look great with long hair i do recommend that.. helps make it look fuller and not so flat and straight (blah like)|`|AA10093245	I never trim at all, if you take good care of it and don't use chemicals, it shouldn't need to be trimmed.<br>  I use Pantene only.

Use coconut oil on it once a month,  use only a natural boar bristle brush, never nylon bristles, never use chemicals.|`|l6s1DMB6aa	You just need some proper hair maintenance for healthy hair while you go through the stages you will love your hair.

I'd invest in the hair care line using shampoo and conditioner daily and definitely the mask (deep conditioning treatment) you will know how often you need to use it based on your hair type and absolutely the hair serum before using any styling tools to prep hair for styling and manageability. They are economical because you only use a tiny amount so they last a very long time.

IxWNkLtzaa	Its best to do this with dirty hair, freshly washed hair is to clean for the curls to stay in, tip your head upside down, spray hair spray on slightly damp hair, then scrunch dry, use a good serum as well to avoid any frizz|`|5ubWLH2paa	the reason may be because your hair is quite thick so weight the curls down, causing them to fall out quickly, so if you want to cut then ask to thin it out. but there are also extra hold hairsprays that you can get (it usually says if it is on the tin). <br>  <br>  hope this has helped|`|gZCReumRaa	omg, that used to happen to me to so i went to my near by hair stylist and they said to try this hair product called natural hair culer by panteen... you curl your hair and then spray it in and it works great... you can by it almost anywhere for cheap|`|1ZfFSH6maa	spray the section of hair your going to curl BEFORE, and then you quickly use the curling iron<br>  also, you could try a heat activated curl spray<br>  <br>  :) :)|`|AA10466027	A loose permanent would help.

Hair scrunching products are designed to bring out the natural wave, and no matter what the product claims, with straight hair this just will not work. If you really want you hair like that, I suggest curling it with a wide barrel curling iron just at the bottom, or maybe a crimper depending on how you want the waves to look. If you want your hair to look like that permanently, I suggest talking to your hair stylist about getting a light perm on the ends of your hair. Hope this helps(:|`|QeALCWbqaa	ask

The Western Cowboy look is in so you'll see lots of fringed shoes, bags, and accessories.There is also a throwback 80s look going on, which includes lots of cardigans (I recommend them in bright colors), liquid leggings, and big and funky glasses. As far as accessories go, you have statement-making necklaces, tons of bangles, chain-handle purses, and if you feel adventurous, python is what's really hot in the fashion world from bags to jackets to shoes. I recommend a store like Forever 21 because they have lots of things that fit a wide variety of styles. Read fashion magazines and watch red carpet shows for more trends.|`|asM2jBAjaa	Florals are in. <br>  Short casual dresses with leggings and boots or flats maybe a cartagine over it<br>  of course american eagle, abercrombie, hollister.<br>  Aeroposle is cheep but a lot of young young girls like 6 and 7 wear it so i would not go there cus you may see a 6 year old wearing the same sweater as you! hahah<br>  Forever 21 is really cute and a lot of high schoolers wear it, but since your 13 is may be too old for youbut go there and see what you can find! <br>  <br>  Good luck :)

DGbu2x7Faa	Curel makes a really good moisturizer, and Nivea in the blue tin, not the white bottle or jar is really good as well. If you want longer lasting moisturizer use an oil such as vitamin E or believe it or not Olive oil [extra virgin of course].  Cocoa butter although it smells real good doesn't seem to last as long but might be a good remedy at home where you can reapply liberally.<br>  <br>  You can try and correct your diet with more fish for some reason it adds moisture to the skin, as well a copious amounts of water.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AtjlmByAaa	Hi, dry skin is a very delicate skin which if left untreated gives rise to premature wrinkling of the skin.  Dry skin is the first sign of Vitamin A deficiency.  If you are suffering from a dry skin you should take vitamin A capsules daily. Eat carrots, sweet potatoes, and liver. Use soap with glycerine.  Do not rub your skin, instead pat it with soft towel. Apply moisturizer immediately after.  If water is left to evaporate on the skin it dries up the skin further.|`|nBaRuZ5xaa	ok first off. try running more. this will get liquids flowing so your legs can shine. also, get special moisturizing lotion for extra dry knees.<br>  here are a few products that may help:<br>  <a href="http://beauty.about.com/od/skinflaws/a/moisturizers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://beauty.about.com/od/skinflaws/a/m...</a><br>  (apply lotion on your legs the minute you get out of the shower.<br>  this is when the lotion is sucked up best)|`|D3rfzhL9aa	Buy some unscented lotion and put it on every time your skin soaks it all up.  And don't slack on doing it.  Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!!!|`|ynZKX4Nxaa	uhhhh, moisturize??! drink lots of water...|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	The best thing I have found is petroleum jelly....use it on your legs and put a warm moist towel over them then add more after removing the towel. Use a shower gel that has cocoa-butter in it and put Vaseline on after you shower, they make a cream in a tube for the whole body or you can use the jelly. It is only a buck at the dollar stores and worth it, especially on your feet at night then put socks on...smooth as a baby's behind in the morn. Have fun and God Bless, Velle T|`|CBfgZRhlaa	Use moisturizer for extra dry skin. The best way to apply moisturizer is during after bath. Then drink a lot of water, get enough sleep and eat healthy foods especially fruits.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	It's very possible that you need more healthy oils and fats in your diet.  You should seriously consider taking about 800 iu of vitamin E and at least 1000 mg of flax oil each day.

8yE2sYGeaa	Price is a good indicator of authenticity and where you buy it as well|`|3L9bRmOqaa	Honestly, you really need to know the brand and actually see one in person.  Study how the bag is made, looking inside and out of the bag.  You have to be a smart shopper.  If the price looks too good to be true, it probably ISN'T!  Buy it from an authorized retailer or the D&G store (they do take phone orders).  <br>  <br>  I would recommend going to the Purse Forums.  The members over there are very knowledable of all handbag brand and can help you (if you decide to buy one from a third party...just provide pictures of the bag):  <a href="http://forum.purseblog.com/handbags-and-purses/" rel="nofollow">http://forum.purseblog.com/handbags-and-...</a>|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	Ensure that you buy from a reputed store.<br>  <br>  Honestly, if you buy from some discount store or website, you wouldn't really know the difference, unless your GF starts using it.<br>  <br>  Why take a chance? If you want to spend less, buy during sale time, in July you would find good bags at discounted prices.<br>  <br>  Whats wrong with people? They want original also, good brand and not want to pay the price and think they can trick the designers by buying fake?<br>  <br>  If you cant afford a good luxury designer bag, buy a smart bag from a high street store. There are so many good bags available, as good as the luxury brands in terms of quality and design, at much less price.<br>  <br>  And if you want D&G, open up your wallet|`|NyVQgjzhaa	An authentic d&g handbag will come with a card inside for you to register the handbag.

Try exposing it to an ionizer...if you don't have one, a car ionizer is not so expensive (those things you stick into the cig lighter socket).

Your handbag may have been stored for a while and just put out on the shelf before you purchased it.  It will air out after a few days.  You want to make sure you let it air out naturally.  Leather is porous and needs to breathe.  Leave it sit out in open space.  Make sure it is not in a bag or the box if it came in one.  You can also try cleaning it with a leather conditioner or leather cleaner that you should be able to get at a shoe store or a leather store.|`|cbcd7cd5aa98ff455d8f941d6a9144a9aa	um , i would go for washing it , look at the instruction's on the tag;<br>  plus the more you wear it the more it wear's out & stop's smelling weird :)|`|KOd5Spehaa	lit a candle up ..the rub the wax alont the inside and the outside pockets|`|ukjxFnqDaa	**** on it

a57c8c672f006f88f08496bd86f7caa6aa	Eyeshadow can help make eyes look bigger, but it's best for bringing out eye color. The best way to make your eyes look bigger is to use eyeliner, curl your eyelashes, and apply mascara. <br>  <br>  That being said, I have green eyes too, and my favorite color combo is a pale pink shimmer color as a highlighter (use from the crease of your eyelid to your brow bone - yes, it seems like it's too high to place eyeshadow, but trust me, it will open your eyes up! just make sure you use a shade that won't stand out too much on your skin tone), a bronze color on the eyelid, and a deeper brown/bronze in the eye crease (use the tip of an eyeshadow brush to apply - it's really tough to do with the foam eyeshadow applicators that come with drugstore eyeshadow palettes.) Also, I like to use a light bone color as a highlighter, light green on the eyelid, and deep green in the crease. The trick is to have three colors in varying shades of intensity to create contrast along your eyelids. If you only want to wear one color, go with a pale green or violet shade on the eyelid only. It will make you look very awake and draw out the color of your eyes. =]|`|Di6FAQxRaa	use brown, green or dark colors|`|oNEwfVKpaa	mascara|`|M6y69Y6gaa	Depending if they're light green or dark.<br>  I love dazzling greens and they always catch my eye with dark smoky make-up.<br>  Search Zacky Vengeance for idea's, he's a dude, but he wear's make up and eyeliners.<br>  If your eyes are dark maybe you could use some light coloured eyeliners? White, lilac kinda thing xx<br>  And by the way, you look stunning in your little picture. And the name ruby totally suits you to a tea ;-) stunner

CRk1goz4aa	I find that using Biore' face wash with St. Ives blackhead scrub clear keeps the black heads from coming more often. I used to get them all the time and this methods keeps my face clear of acne and  black heads. Also, at the drugstore, near the nail, tweezer and manicure items, they sell little blackhead removers. You just slide if over the area and it will bring it right out. EW! :) <br>  But that will keep you from having to squeeze your face and clear it at the same time. Hope this helps!|`|06HPTp3uaa	Well.

ZTTdm4dWaa	Shave.|`|rgNP0Qo6aa	probably $150 a session<br>  or $500 for 6<br>  <br>  Okay... science answer:<br>  <br>  You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.<br>  <br>  Okay... Personal Experience:<br>  <br>  I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.<br>  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:<br>  Bikini-$750<br>  Underarms-$750<br>  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions about it!|`|dv8267AAaa	Not sure, probably should look up the information online... or ask a local hospital or engineering center.|`|AA11843679	2 of my friends got it 1 time, I think it was around 1500. but they did upper lip, and underarm.

f4ba47a2857db6a4c06027dd19f8455aaa	Earthtones that have warmth to them may look best on a brown-haired, fair-skinned, pale white maiden...... A little complimentary gold, ochre, peach, some yellows, etc. Stay away from sharply contrasting colors like bright, medium, saturated, or dark blues, greens, reds, and purples and lean towards less than midtone saturation values or even lean more towards pastels or a few shades darker than true pastel shades. Subtlety in enhancing your existing tones and features is always best. Just make what you have more variegated and it will make your face come alive more subtly. But if you really like purple, for example, then get a soft pale purple pastel. Just a glint and not too strong on contrast. And you can take a few steps away from that overall paleness if it is almost a ghostly white by using a very light beige foundation or a very pale cream color and a tiny touch of color in your cheeks. Don't overdo it. I have a female friend that I used to go dancing with sometimes who used her lipstick as a blush on her cheek and blended it so soft and lightly and it always matched her lips and she could literally put her face on in the parking lot of the club in 3 minutes and look a lot better than many women who primped and danced before their mirrors for 3 hours. She knew the arts of subtlety and simplicity and she always looked great, not like an over-painted dime-store cutey-doll! LOL As for glasses, go with a color that is at least a few tones darker and further away from your hair and make-up shades or a median point somewhere in between your hair and make-up shades, but again, not a radical contrast in starkly diverging colors. If you want more color try maybe some red glitter very sparingly to heat up your earthtones a bit more for nightlife but not in the brightness of daytime, just a little glistening highlight of red here and there, like fairy dust. LOL Get yourself a color-wheel at an art supply store to use as a guide for judging the most common complimentary colors and how they are generally perceived by people. It should be under $5 to $10 dollars and is made of colored coated cardboard but it can help people to easily understand the relationships of color harmony better. Color is a language of its' own. With pale white skin you don't want to look like a circus clown by wearing really bold or saturated colors. That's why you can bring all your colors together and warm up your face-tones or tone-down your make-up or both to find a great equillibrium.  Just my own opinion here. I hope it helps. P. S. Make up your face the way you think you look most beautiful and what you want it to look like and are willing to fuss with most days and for most occasions and try on many pairs of glasses until you find that best everyday look that can always be toned up or toned down but will still look good with the glasses on too, for work or play, night or day. If you're rich enough buy several pair to change your mood for the day or for the events you may typically use them most at. i..e. Nightlife, Daytime, Work, Leisure, and maybe a special pair for sexy date nights.|`|a5jAKxQjaa	I wouldn't say brown, you need a clashing colour, i think i'd go for purple, it is stylish and fits with brown, your description sounds about the same as me.

There's a chain of shops here which supply beauty salons (can't remember the name) they're in most big cities here which ordinary people can use too.  You can get big 500ml bottles of their cheapest (but it's good quality) cleanser, toner and moisturiser for about ￡3.  It lasts for ages and you know you're using beauty salon quality.  I just decant them into smaller bottles for my dressing table.  I'd suggest a big bottle of their Rosewater (an excellent toner for dry skin).  I'd cleanse first then get a rough-ish cloth, like a facecloth or towel etc, to remove the cleanser gently with but kind of massage it at the same time, so you're doing a kind of gentle exfoliation each time.  It really brightens up your skin, I do it every day.  Then the rosewater, then I'd suggest Manuka honey instead of moisturiser (just a tiny scraping of it over your whole face, tie your hair back and sleep with it then rinse if off in the morning with cold water), and do that routine every night.  You will notice a huge difference, trust me.  The honey will provide your skin with lots of nutrients and brighten it up no end.  Give it about 2 weeks (or less) and you'll see.  If you can't afford manuka honey, ordinary honey from your cupboard.  You'll go through a tiny pot in about a month.  Hope that helps!|`|xKyBUnesaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  To the girl who said she used a facial scrub day and night - you should only use a facial scrub or exfoiliator once a week. If you use one more than this its harsh for the skin and you will find eventually more spots appear. My lecturer told me this who is a qualified beauty therapist.<br>  What you should be using is a facial wash instead that is fine daily.<br>  <br>  I would recommend garnier cleanser a cream based in a pink bottle I use this and its really good. Try Asda or tescos to buy anything you'll find that boots are using higher in price.<br>  <br>  Simple is also very good, because you have dry skin you'll also want something that isn't too harsh on the skin. <br>  <br>  Another recommendation for you is to buy a facial wash like simple for dry skin and use baby wipes which you can find very cheap they are great for taking make up off.<br>  <br>  I have dry skin too, moisturiser is a lifesafer for me. palmer's cocoa butter smells lovely and you can use it for face and body its perfect for dry skin. Moisturiser will definitely help your dry skin.|`|puLtMrNIaa	I have been working in a cosmetics studio for about 5 years and I defiantly know my skin care. This is your skin and you need to take care of it well. Try to avoid using something just because it's inexpensive. Those products are not usually made with as good ingredients. Something that is good that is ULTRA-CALMING FOAMING CLEANSER by Aveeno. It's great for dry skin; it's inexpensive, and made with good ingredients. Use that daily. Follow up with a three time a week treatment with Aveeno's CLEAR COMPLEXION CREAM CLEANSER. Also every morning and night after cleansing your face apply Aveeno POSITIVELY SMOOTH FACIAL MOSTURIZER.

If your fair skinned I would start out only 1-2 times a week just to get used to it.

Tanning beds are very harmful and can cause permanent damage. I would use a tanning lotion that builds up over time instead. A tanning bed cooks your skin and the lotion stains your skin to get that tan look.

JhJXKRkOaa	I have blue eyes and I use the collection 2000 eyeshadow trio called "dolly mixture" and dazzle me pots in sugarplum and magical and I have one solo eyeshadow called "frosting" think this one plus other colors are new eye shadows out in collection 2000.|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	Dark shades, to accent your beautiful hazel eyes ! (wink,wink)|`|Gd3fvciaaa	Different shades of browns and blues.<br>  You can use them together or separate either way they will make blue/ green eyes pop.|`|7J8jYIe4aa	I have blue eyes also and I like golds or browns or I even like to put my bronzer on as eyeshadow it really makes them pop.|`|55bf89b95658e65af7827cede5ad23b6aa	Brown<br>  Burgundy<br>  Gray<br>  <br>  Sometimes blue and green eyeshadow looks good too|`|mdOocxZ2aa	Brown all the way. you can use blue or green highlighting eyeshadow colors too.|`|nnuTNmWsaa	i dont know about green eyes but i have blue eyes and i like to use a shimmery brown or bronze and brown eyeliner and black mascara. black eyeliner look too harsh on blue eyes sometimes|`|zDXDkWeJaa	gray goes well with green, browns with blue, smoky blacks go well with both.|`|XDTRe2GYaa	i don't know exactly but go to almay.com they the new intense i-color and choose the one just for you|`|dUbRn8hHaa	browns and black
vVTmJjJDaa	definitely the first ones - but be sure and ask for a free trial pair (they virtually always do this anyway)...as you want to be sure that you like them before you lay down your money...also, keep in mind, that although they say they are suitable for any eye color, how they look on you will most likely *not* be the same - especially if your eyes are medium or dark brown - the color will still be blue, but it will be much less of a vivid blue....i know this for sure, because my niece just got them - they look good, but they're definitely darker than the same exact brand and color pictured in the brochure she showed me beforehand.|`|KGOxYkh7aa	they are pretty, but i dont think they are going to look natural to anyone if you have brown eyes. go with the first one thought i lovee that color and it looks most natural. like an icyy blue.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	i like the first blue ones because the other ones seem to have a darker line outside which looks so fake|`|U05mOMF6aa	First ones look more natural, but the second ones are gorgeous.|`|4P0Gmsa8aa	the first ones. they look more natural.|`|bHBTgngvaa	the second one definately-they will make u unique!|`|Y2juhrMTaa	I actually love the second pair because the first are so over used. When you wear the second pair, people will do a double take because they',ve never seen it before. It makes you original. I'd wear them =-)|`|mbxz3e0Baa	definitely the first one :)|`|56h188uoaa	first one
b98399109be318e3b79301e0534af71caa	very well :)<br>  first, you would need several basic items in your makeup bag.<br>  1. Concealer<br>  2. Foundation (Liquid foundation would do better)<br>  3. Loose powder<br>  4. blush.<br>  4. Eyeliner<br>  5. Mascara and eyelash curler.<br>  6. Lipgloss/Liptint/Lipstick.<br>  <br>  how to wear your make-up:<br>  1. even out the foundation all over face and neck (small amount will do better to avoid caking your complexion)<br>  2. use the concealer to cover up the visible spots (e.g. freckles, scars, dark circles around your eyes, etc)<br>  3. Use the loose powder after you finish to even out your complexion (loose powder can absorb oil excess and to brighten your skin tone)<br>  4. Apply blush on the apple of your cheeks. choose the blush colour according to your skin tone when you blush/run/heated.<br>  5. draw lines with the eyeliner on the bottom part of your eyelid (right on the lash line) and on the top of your eyelid. this will make your eyes to look bigger and attractive.<br>  6. curl your eyelash with the eyelash curler and apply a few coats of mascara to add more volume to your eyelash. (remember to NEVER curl your eyelash with the eyelash curler AFTER applying mascara)<br>  7. apply some lipgloss/tint/stick to your lips. i think a sweet pink colour will suit you.<br>  <br>  <br>  additional makeup:<br>  1. eyeshadow<br>  2. fake eyelashes.<br>  <br>  these are not very important except for parties and etc.<br>  <br>  1. a dark brown/teal/copper colour suits your complexion. simply apply them on your eyelids. a dark brown eyeshadow would do good for a smoky eye effect.<br>  2. fake eyelashes are not very neccessary unless it is a huge party. simply place the glue on the lashes and stick it right on your lash line.<br>  <br>  <br>  i hope this helps. I am not an expert in the make up field but i do help my models to do their make up for my runway projects.<br>  <br>  P.S. Make up DOES NOT makes you look old if you know the right trick :)<br>  <br>  <br>  and one more thing. I recommend all the products that a person can use to improve their complexion because the question states, <br>  "i want to experiment with make up for like..... parties and stuff."<br>  <br>  so Lily, i would have to disagree with what you said about my answer, thank you ^.^|`|RbLw8izTaa	i disagree with the first answer, you do not need that much makeup!<br>  <br>  ok well i think that you should use a limited amount. you have nice skin so you dont need foundation or concealer, you can just use pressed powder (those little compacts with a mirror and powder- they are inexpensive in the stores). and your eyes are BIG! so you can emphisize them by wearing mascara and a little bit of eyeliner. not liquid though, liquid doesn't emphisize large eyes. i think you should use pencil eyeliner. also, if you want to groom your eyebrows, you can use brown tinted brow gel. and lastly, a pretty plum/purpleish-red lipgloss would look cute on you!<br>  <br>  so thats<br>  *mascara/eyeliner<br>  *pressed powder<br>  *brow gel<br>  *gloss<br>  <br>  good luck ^-^|`|xO2TIwsJaa	um how old are you? <br>  <br>  But if u want to wear make up i suggest a good foundation and concealer (go to youtube and type in foundation tutorial), eyeliner and mascara. that's all you really need to wear.|`|bProyggzaa	i don't really agree with the first answer as that is way too much makeup for someone just starting to really experiment with makeup i am a level 3 qualified makeup artist and you really should stick to basics you don't look like you need foundation in the picture so just use a very light coat of powder, as for eyes use pencil eyeliner if you want to use it on your upper lid and want to know and good tip for applying evenly put your finger up to the corner of your eye and pull to the side slightly while watching carefully and lightly slide the pencil across the eyelid sticking as close as you can to your lashes. as for eye shadows just experiment with whichever colours you feel comfortable with and keep them neat as your younger stick to just the eyelid no higher up when experimenting with the colours as well don't go too dark. as for lips just stick to a pretty pinky colour lipgloss<br>  <br>  hope it helps ya out|`|AA11169792	hey if you want to start wearing makeup i would suggest: an eye primer like Urban Decay Primer Potion ($16 at Sephora) or Almay eye base+ concealer. Eye primers are important if you want your makeup to look good and last all day! Then I would get a light pink and neutral eyeshadow colors like browns and light colors for highlighting. Highlighting is optional though. I would get a black/brown eyeliner. I would suggest to start out by using pencils. I recommend Jordana (they're only 99cents) or Wet n Wild. I definitely recommend using lip balm/chapsticks. They really help in the cold weather and also acts as a primer for your lips. I also suggest lip gloss. You can buy whatever color you like but I recommend a clear lip gloss and also a light pink color. And also an eyeshadow brush is a must! You can get them at Target for about $2.! I hope this helps you out! Since you're starting out with makeup, this is pretty much all you need and then once you're more experienced then you can start using high end brands (they're really expensive) and more colors.! :)|`|Ta5qMu9Yaa	You should just stick to mascara for now, if you Really want to experiment with make up. Keep the natural look going......try some lip gloss when you go out....just to give your lips some shine....that's it...and plus, you still look young.....you don't need make up...=)

pus08YEOaa	Not really because they use too much product to sell a lot of it, but you can get free samples for a consultation so you might as well try it.|`|QHpq3QpAaa	I have seen people who got makeovers there and they looked really good. If it is free, you have nothing to lose, youre not obligated to buy anything. It is always fun to try on a new look, and i believe the people who work at Sephora have had some kind of training to do that... not like at the dept. store. at most dept. store makeup counters sales experience i sfavored over talent in makeup. I have had my makeup done at the estee lauder counter and looked like a clown!|`|yCYw735Aaa	I personally prefer MAC makeovers because they are a professional brand and they have more variety.  I tried both and I thought that MAC makeovers stay on longer and they had really good advice and the color was really great.  But if you think you don't really need a makeover then ask a MAC sales to help you choose colors that look good on you.  Sephora is cheaper than MAC, but their products aren't as good.  I don't know if you have to pay for MAC makeovers though...you can ask for someone to help put makeup on you to pick colours but I don't know about a full makeover.|`|5bg0hEQIaa	Yes, they do and this person who said Sephora is CHEAPER than MAC? Ummm no, it is not cheaper. They have better products which is obviously going to cost more. MAC foundations run about 26 bucks and almost ALLL of the Sephora foundations are $35 plus, but they have sooo many different brands that you can try on. Just ask the make-up consultant to set up an appointment the day before you want to go or call in to make the appointment. They have NARS, MUFE, Laura Mercier, DIOR, Smashbox.<br>  <br>  Oh! I love the Snow Bunny Bronzer, Orgasm Bulsh from NARS, and the Dior Show mascara.<br>  <br>  The one thing I love about MAC is their eyeshadows, THEN you can go to MAC and buy them for $14.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!

By accepting them, you are reinforcing his interest in you, which opens then door for him to continue to add a sexual aspect to the relationship.  If you're ok with taking the relationship in that direction, go ahead and accept the gift.  If you want the relationship to remain strictly platonic, politely decline the gift and insist that you simply cannot accept it.|`|MkZ3hzTEaa	Well if he's platonic, then it's little weird. But maybe this is just his un suttle way of saying I like you.

T4aG8j95aa	I think you would be better off going 7 minutes three times a month.  17 minutes is a long time and you might turn red, which means a burn, which is very bad for your skin.  Hopefully you are using "high pressure" UVA beds to maintain it, because tans from the UVB beds fade more quickly.

I don't seem to get many/any pimples anymore. I use it on my face when I shower and it makes shaving easier too
bwJSJ49Oaa	I have the same skin colour and if I want a nude colour, I actually just use foundation! I got a small tester tube of a shade darker than the one I normally use which is good.  Or I've used a tinted moisturiser also.  Another thing is under-eye concealer...or go into a department store to try different ones.  Another thing I do is use the shade darker foundation then blend a lipstick on top and mix together, so you get a bit of colour.  It helps your lipstick last longer too!  <br>  If you want to go for a colour though - depends what you want, and what other makeup you have on esp eyeshadow.  There's a few shades of red I've discovered (by trial + error) or pale shimmery pink esp with baby blue eyeshadow.  All the beiges....<br>  Hope that gives you a few ideas.|`|d09f570877bcea55a8ab8640d6b86637aa	if you have very pale skin, why not go for the classic english rose look and get a deep red<br>  or a letterbox red<br>  get one with blue undertones though because ones with orange undertones make teeth look off-white<br>  <br>  other than that, id suggest just playing around with different colours and finishes<br>  <br>  have fun<br>  xxx|`|mdOocxZ2aa	um peach colors will look good, or dark redish peaach colors would look sweet.|`|HsRRK6mWaa	im pale too,<br>  if you live in the uk you should defo go to boots and see there natural collection lipsticks cause there all nude or baby pink, there really cheap but the quality isn't. <br>  or maybe you should try maybelleine satin pinks?<br>  or GOSH [from superdrugs] in darling.<br>  :]|`|3AXlgGgUaa	Just go for nude pink/rose lipsticks.<br>  <br>  The one that model has on is just a very frosted pink gloss.
gQ63jsihaa	Tongue piercings are practically painless. I couldn't even feel mine. I would say a 2 for the tongue, a 3 for the lip and a 2 for the nostril (I have all of them done).

yNbGq4viaa	If you want to get rid of it you're pretty much going to have to wax it every couple of weeks or have expensive laser hair removal...which doesn't always work permanently.  You could pluck it, but that's more painful than waxing.  Yes, shaving it will make it come back thicker and darker.  If you want proof ask any man.  When their beard comes in first it's usually like peach fuzz.  After they start shaving is when they get the coarse hairs.  This also happens when women start shaving their legs.  Common knowledge.  I don't recommend Nair for your face.  In fact, I think the directions actually tell you not to get it anywhere near your eyes.  That stuff sets me on fire and I can't use it.  If you have sensitive skin I'd stay away from that stuff.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	may be bleach it|`|3JkZPMvYaa	there is this sally hansen creme that u just apply a little on and then leace for like 8 mins then your hair comes off but beware or nair for sensitive places like your mustache area  it could burn ur eyes to death lol personally i like to bleach my face it tones it out from every use and it makes my hairs practially invisible|`|CRk1goz4aa	Bleach it....|`|FoFvHsjiaa	Well whoever that guy who noticed it is is a total jerk with no tact...<br>  <br>  Anyway, I used to feel the same way about my facial hair and I didn't actively seek the removal of the hair, but I started using this face wash called AcneFree and I don't think my mustache went away, but seriously it got a thousand times lighter.  I didn't even notice until a few weeks later, but I couldn't see it at all... And it's not just the AcneFree brand, it's any acne wash that has benzoyl peroxide in it.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, I know you said that you'd rather get rid of the hair, but this is a good alternative to bleaching.  Besides, I don't see what other method you are looking to find if you don't want to wax...  I wouldn't recommend shaving either though...  But you could always try tweezing.  Other than that, I really don't know what else you could do .|`|TCEMPM4maa	Your mum is telling you the truth, when you shave your leg hair or armpits don't they come out looking horrible:S Think about it this way, MEN shave facial hair and don't you see how theirs come out. Whatever you do, don't shave it. <br>  <br>  Your best option is to wax, its painful for a split second but its worth it. OR if you're patient you can pluck the hair with tweezers but that hurts aswell and it doesn't pull the hair all at once, its few at a time so it will hurt more than wax.<br>  Or you could get rid of them by getting it threaded, go to your hairdresser or something and see if they do threading.<br>  xx|`|hEAdpYHvaa	Turn on some music and pluck it with good quality tweezers. Takes me like 15 minutes to do a whole upper lip, and it doesn't really sting. DO NOT shave it.|`|hX1Qfs3qaa	Just use some Nair. It works well, and quickly.<br>  <br>  But getting it waxed hardly hurts at all, lasts longer, and doesn't use chemicals. And it's not too expensive.|`|44HGVyRZaa	Well, first off, you're mom is kinda right. it's not so much that it grows back darker. it grows back thicker. i would go into detail but i know all you care about is getting that hair removed. i know exactly where you're coming from. thanks to strong dominant genes, i am now a victim of unwanted hair. But you know they have hair removal creams. Like VEET. there's no waxing or shaving. you put this cream on and let it sit for like 5 to 10 minutes. it melts the hair away or something like that. but when you wash it off, the hair comes right off with it. it doesn't sting, hurt, or anything. the only problem is that you know it works because it had a terrible smell. but it's a small price to pay. wash the smell away and you perfect.

And let's face it, acne is a enormous nuisance! Don't worry though - getting clear skin is entirely possible.<br>  <br>  First off, let's take a look the reason why the acne treatment products you buy in the drugstores almost never work. It's important to know this if you want to clear your skin. The trouble with most of of the treatments out there is that they are designed to only cover up or treat pimples AFTER they have already appeared. They merely try to get rid of pimples one by one rather than treating acne at the heart of the issue.<br>  <br>  More Info Here:-|`|pDiLXpXaaa	It can but but its not a fact.

Just shave every morning and it will grow back faster and all over your cheeks/chin area.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|WOq13TYjaa	i like it|`|FZRZFusuaa	In the second picture it looks like you are shaving too much off the top (the cheek area you are asking about)  - just clean up the line enough to make it straight but don't cut into it - keep it as natural and clean as possible  - same goes for trimming up on the bottom (or neck area)   <br>  <br>  Grow it out a little more (you can always shave it off)  and then keep it trimmed with a 2 guard or shorter - this will have a "scruffy" type appearance - too much longer and it will look odd with your shorter haircut|`|119ef08c7749b873756963e35de2ab40aa	dont grow ur beard like that trust me us chicks dont like that style, but mayve try one of em stylish beards not a full grown beard jus something bit more fancy like pehaps t.i :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.starpulse.com/Photos/Previews/ti-music-w07.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.starpulse.com/Photos/Previ...</a><br>  <br>  or perhaps sumat like a line down fro the side burns to the other side burn and then a line from the chin towards the bottom lip somat nice :)|`|pvCXXW7Yaa	it looks okay but personally, i dont really like beards..and other girls might not either =/|`|SHoGWZWPaa	Beards are the ugliest thing on guys.

kUE3Ddktaa	Is the wedding in a church? If so, don't wear any outfit that you wouldn't wear to church with your grandmother - this includes tons of cleavage or tons of leg or bare shoulders or anything super-tight. It's simply disrespectful to the couple, the officiant, and the people who worship in that building. If the wedding is at a hotel or other non-religious venue, you have a lot more leeway.<br>  <br>  If you want to wear this dress but be sure you aren't crossing the line of good taste, pair it with a wrap, cardigan, or jacket that you can wear during the ceremony and then take off for dinner/dancing. And avoid the sky-high heels - a lower heel will tone down some of the sexiness without being dowdy.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Not if it's in a church.|`|9dd18f9e6c34eb25a0a374720657f305aa	stay away from bright colors that would overshadow what the bride is wearing in anyway.

I would say the brightness of the dress would not be appropriate in terms of etiquette.|`|6jXuUCdraa	its a cute dress, just a bit tight around the chest area and loose at the bottomom, so it looks kind of weird. tone down the color to a soft pink, purple or blue.|`|QxSwGGI3aa	it's adorable but not suitable for a wedding sorry:(|`|prllht3vaa	I think its cute.

She might be able to model teen cloths, but if she is not thin then she is right she won't get hired.<br>  There is another problem with being that age she may have to do sexual favors if she wants to advance in her job.<br>  She would have to study how to walk and etc to present the clothes.|`|KjzR1k1Kaa	Yes, shes very pretty!<br>  She has gorgeous hair! AND Clear skin! (IM JEALOUS ;p )<br>  But modeling is also a lot attitude and mindset. Just watch America's Nexto Top Model.|`|pG6hOnNkaa	She is very pretty but, it seems like every blonde i see look very similar. Like, she doesn't really have anything unique about her.

She's a tad on the short side for commercial (5'6" is more the minimum). <br>  If she's truly interested in becoming a model, research agencies in your area, as they're really the only people who can truly give a good opinion.<br>  I would also recommend joining www.modelmayhem.com to learn more. :)|`|32Rba58Laa	Yes, she's very pretty! Most models are taller so she'd need to grow, but she also looks a lot older than her age.|`|b4MXp6mdaa	she looks older, she's kinda pretty. She would need to lose weight. You know, you need to be able to see her cheek bones to be a model. <br>  <br>  She has that whole, simple n sweet look to her. <br>  <br>  Maybe commercial modeling!|`|sQaw02vvaa	shes so pretty and dont listen to any mean comments she totally could! i love her hair straightened i could def see her in a revlon commercial! haha tell her to try you only live once!|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	shes pretty but seriously think about school before you think about modeling|`|IsoUAEEnaa	if she grows at least 5 inches taller then it is possible but she'll have to be super thin.|`|lyMMjVNgaa	I dont think so<br>  but shes pretty|`|Ji0akFDGaa	yes she is very pretty and has gorgeous eyes|`|TmgEbCrZaa	No way..<br>  <br>  she looks like a troll.. lol jks..<br>  <br>  she real hot, and she looks older than me.. im 15|`|KUiVzQDFaa	yaa she could if she wore heels with everythin to bring her up to 5' 8|`|hX1Qfs3qaa	If she wanted to, I'm sure she could get into it.|`|Vge3KBaMaa	no but she is quite pretty|`|a5jAKxQjaa	wow she looks alot older than 13!<br>  yeh definitely, she's really pretty:) i'd say go for it!|`|cJ7wHfknaa	she has a tight one so yeahh|`|ip0VuS3Daa	it depends for what kind of modeling job. but i think she'd be OK|`|gdTsMRgoaa	Commercial print.. ya.

qxrr69bnaa	Most newer commercial tanning beds have facial tanners.  The facial tanner is an area in the canopy of the bed that contains bulbs that tan the face and are not as strong as the ones for the rest of the body.  Some of these beds have a switch that will allow you to turn the facial tanner off.<br>  <br>  Of course, some of the less expensive beds do not have facial tanners.  I guess you would call these "regular" beds.|`|RzWNjUgraa	nothing really. they both give you cancer so either way your gonna die. good luck. have a happy life.

yNbGq4viaa	If you burn easily, I can't help you as I very rarely burn, but it takes me forever to tan dark.  I usually use Ban de Soleil dark tanning oil with SPF 8 to get a base tan.  <br>  <br>  If you don't burn easily and you want to tan REALLY dark...creamy baby oil.  You will fry yourself if you don't have a good base tan though so be careful.  It's cheap and it works better for a dark tan than anything on the market.  My friend uses it with just a drop or two of betadine in it to make her look darker until she tans.  I think that turns her a little "orange" at first...she does get very tan however.|`|1TrWuMOraa	I'm exactly like you, except with green eyes, so I just use baby lotion so that your skin is not dry, cause if it's dry it will automatically burn and then any type of tanning oil, not tanning lotion will work fine. Trust me, I hate to have sunburn! good luck, have fun!|`|Wy8OOSj5aa	I like Marshmallow cream.

You could try extensions, but why bother that much?
mVnZkwcGaa	As others have said here, i think a straight cut fringe would suit you, with either some short layers at the top to give a bit of height and razor-ed ends or no layers and bluntly cut at the ends. Alternatively you could go quite short, messy with loads of layers and a razor-ed fringe.<br>  For colours i think a rich red or dark mahogany would suit you. I think a really dark rich chocolate colour would go gorgeous with the bluntly but fringe and straight cut, while red colours would be really cool with the more choppy styles.......just what i think. :)|`|E3Bjk7Jeaa	i would say like a medium blonde woth a few dark streaks<br>  <br>  or all balck with reddy purple streaks your hair is fabulous by the way you can do loads with it maybe you should try having it curly <br>  <br>  i think the hair styles match personality's if you like dark cothes or love dark hair then black or dark brown is perfect for you however if you love the sunshine then blonde is definetly you so its your choice hunneh good luck x x <br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  <br>  ?babylurv!|`|ovPfkHSCaa	Looking for the hot short hairstyles for 2009?

Give each one another spray - Not too much, it will go crispy! and leave for about twenty minutes.<br>  <br>  Untie the buns and then mess it up a bit with your fingers, and then backcomb a little bit if you want to :)<br>  <br>  If you want, i find putting a few hair extensions in to give my hair a bit more texture. I get my extensions from Afro hairdressers, there around ￡30 for two full head sets of hair. These are human hair so you can curl, straighten etc. <br>  <br>  Curl the extensions using hair straightners, then brush them out to create waves. Add a cute little plaited band (mine was made from an extra hair extension haha) but you can buy them in new look.<br>  <br>  This is what it should turn out like :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=n5oj2p&s=5" rel="nofollow">http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=n5oj2p&s...</a><br>  <br>  i started doing my hair like this after i saw diana vickers, as i thought her hair always looked so good! <br>  <a href="http://img.metro.co.uk/i/pix/2008/11/dianavickersREX_450x350.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.metro.co.uk/i/pix/2008/11/dia...</a><br>  <br>  2009 is all about big hair, overly straight, sleek styles just look too try hard these days :) They're so much easier to do, you're not ruining your hair with straightners and boys love this look!<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :D x|`|6kvyXUNWaa	Your pictures are really bad quality.<br>  You can only actually make you out in two of them.<br>  I think you should cut your hair to above shoulder length and get some bangs and layers.|`|x5NzYL8Taa	Short choppy layers and maybe a block fringe :)|`|N37v3VkNaa	youve got a great face shape i think you could pull off a cut like frankie from the saturdays|`|QFnaCs5saa	I think you would look really cute with a MUCH shorter 'do!

wgWbm2zUaa	I would go with the simple one.  It is classy and elegant.  Plus, if she wants more around the ring, you can always go with a wrap for the wedding band.  I am very happy we did this with my ring.  I had the two fused together after the wedding and so I do not have to take off two rings to cook or do the dishes (especially nice if my fingers are a little swollen). <br>  <br>  A simple ring can go with any style wedding band; whereas you would be restricted by what will go as far as looks and comfort with the other ring.  It is fun to pick out the wedding bands together and with the simple one, you'll have more options.|`|PUUXbVK2aa	i like the princess cut more.<br>  : D|`|LWvh2g2maa	I like the simple and traditional ring.|`|AA12109789	I like princess cut better but I also like rings with more than one stone.

The first one is simple and elegant.

JT4OSUPeaa	I found this for you :)<br>  <br>  Apply cool tea bags, an ice cube wrapped in soft cloth, or cucumber slices to your eyes daily. The tannin in tea bags has been shown to reduce swelling and discoloration, and cucumber slices have long been used to reduce puffiness and refresh the appearance of skin around the eyes. Lie down, preferably in the morning, and leave fresh cucumber slices or cool, damp caffeinated tea bags (you can refrigerate them overnight so they’ll be ready) over your eyes for about 10-15 minutes. Keep your eyes closed.|`|um29wkUPaa	Preparation H.  No kidding. (circles)<br>  More hydration (circles and white ring)|`|OT8TMTOHaa	Put cold cucumber on them.|`|hEAdpYHvaa	1. Get enough sleep!|`|6F42afSraa	Preparation H is, of course, a hemorrhoid cream. It contains phenylephrine, a powerful constrictor of blood vessels. It helps hemorrhoids by constricting the blood vessels, squeezing the blood out of the hemorroid, and causing them to shrink.<br>  <br>  In theory, Preparation H can do the same thing for your puffy eyes. The phenylephrine will constrict the delicate blood vessels under your eyes, squeezing the fluid out and reducing the puffiness.|`|16f786290d793ae0cfafb186615cca8daa	Cold wet teabags will help, cucumber slices will help, but Preparation H will work the fastest. You could do a combination of those things, too.|`|YuL7jeraaa	Put tea bags under your eyes. Or, you can put cucumbers over them, but I reccomed the tea bags because they work better.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	They kinda look the opposite of bags!

9IH2Hdlqaa	Do you use powder?  You can buy a translucent powder (that'll match any colour foundation your wearing) for fairly cheaply.  Also (if you don't already) apply a light non-oily moisturiser as a base before you put on your make up and weight about 10 mins for it to sink in.  This'll give you a good base for applying make up.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Use Neutrogena or mineral wear products. They last all day and don't make your skin look oily.|`|6jcEtPPKaa	I wish you were a little more specific when you wrote "horrible". Are you sure you are applying it the right way on your face? And what kind of make-up are you using? Just because it's not old it doesn't mean that it's good quality. I use Chanel, Mac, Dior, Clinique and Bare Minerals (natural, organic make-up). This stuff is pricey but it look good, not fake and it won't damage my skin. Hope this helped.|`|JO3j4fpXaa	If you have dry skin then you should buy make suited to that.<br>  Make sure you wash your face twice daily.<br>  If all else fails take your make up to school and apply it again throughout the day :)|`|qDd84PDpaa	after you've put your concealer foundation on, gently brush over with talcom powder, this helps your make up stay on for longer, then brush over with a light face powder, it works for me! hope this helps.|`|cK6G9ilBaa	get a primer or set it with a powder check out maccosmetics.com in the face section<br>  for eyes Urban decay primer potion (sephora.com), it helps the makeup last all day|`|TfL5pFBOaa	Usually that happens with any drugstore makeup..if you are using drugstore makeup i recommendd splurging and buying some department store. Here are some suggestions.<br>  MAC Mineralize SPF 15 Foundation (Loose) ($29.00) <br>  The foundation goes on easily, and I don’t find that I get a lot of it flying off my skin or exploding into a powder cloud (like other loose powders/mineral makeup), so I do like that. It gave me decent coverage, and it didn’t make certain acne spots look too dry when it went over them<br>  You can purchase it at your local MAC store|`|9anQxbRGaa	Do you do the following: Cleanse, Tone, apply a Primer, and moisturize?<br>  If not this could be why - primer helps a lot and helps foundation go on pretty smooth and evenly.<br>  <br>  However I have the same problem as you - it normally ends up being because whenever I check my makeup in school the lighting is TERRIBLE. Whatever you do don't apply more or it goes worse. <br>  <br>  Alternatively use a reliable all day make up, like Double Wear from Estée Lauder.
ttuZbRjbaa	you might can try some kind of scar lotion or something... usually what the doctor prescribes is expensive, but you can ask the pharmacist if there's a generic brand and they'll usually give it to you...|`|Cs2urP26aa	Astringent!!!
qVgr5OBeaa	Um well, I along with everyone else wore heels several nights on the cruise I went on. It was a 7 day cruise. Yeah, the boat does sway and we were on one of the biggest cruise boats (Carnival Conquest). You can deffinantly feel it, but you get used to it. They will give you some great motion sickness pills for free if you ask for them! It's not any harder to walk in heels (especially if you are used to wearing them and i don't wear them much) than it is flip flops or whatever.<br>  <br>  Wear the heels, girl!! At least take them and you will find out if you feel comfortable wearing them or not.|`|Q1t0XzgZaa	Youll be fine. When I go on cruises I do NOT go without several pairs of heels. I wear flip flops pretty much all day long, and also at night if we arent going to a nice dinner, but when we are, I am soooo wearing heels. Its not like the ship is a small motor boat or speed boat, it wont rock you all over the place, so your fine!!!! Have fun!!!!|`|d8EYaNw2aa	i am sure you can wear heels with your dress for the ball idk why it would be a bad idea not to i mean i can see on like the edge or like when your just walking around but i think you should be fine for the ball|`|ZssP10Efaa	You sound like you have good balance... wear heals.... but if you fall and hurt yourself because of heals..the cruise is not liable|`|BJERgbM5aa	A cruise ship is not a 'boat'. It's a 'ship' and a floating hotel.  You can wear heals till you're blue in the face.  Wear them to bed if you want, no problem.  A boat is what some people store in their driveway during winter months & in the summer, pull it with their car and put it in the water to go fishing, etc.  You never wear heals on a boat.  Have a wonderful cruise.  I'm jealous.|`|qhKP68eiaa	I would just be careful.  The boats do rock and play havic with your balance.  You might fall, but just be careful and you should be fine!  Have fun!
kUE3Ddktaa	DON'T exfoliate in the shower. Use a moisturizer body wash and apply it either with your hands or a very soft, gentle loofah - no scrubbing, no scratchy sponges, no washcloth or you'll scrub the tan right off.<br>  <br>  After you shower, use a good moisturizer to keep your skin from drying out - dry skin will lose a tan faster than moisturized skin, because the top layer will just flake off.|`|WCdiByUBaa	hmm maybe not using it because it does not look natural at all sorry but you can totally tell and its not even pretty
f7wWWroKaa	Between your hair color and your blue eyes you definatly want to make your eyes pop ....I suggest you go to the Mac counter the makeup artist does a really good job at suggestion the pefect makeup for you. Plus its really good quality stuff if this is your first time experimenting with makeup dont buy the cheap stuff, because the drug store clerk will not help you in chosing a brand and color thats right for you...i suggest that you use grays, violets, taupes, purples, and deep blues. Deep blues like a deep blue eyeliner instead of a black eyeliner will make your eyes pop...The taupes will bring out your hair color...and the violets are more for a softer look....maybe even light shades of pink if you want to have a natural color.....But Mac makeup is the way to go they last all day plus if you finish like 6 of the containers of the eyeshadow, foundation, lipstick anything of their product that is plastic...you can get a free lipstick or eyeshadow!! i love it!!! Also, please dont wear baby blue eyeshadow thats soooooooooooooo 80's!! and for lipstick i suggest that you go with your natural color like clear lip gloss or a color similar to your skin or lips...your eyes are a beautiful blue and should be the main focus on your face....Oh before i 4get use bronzer on your face to give yourself a slight glow...it enhances your complexion as if you have just been sunkissed...and that will bring out your hair color as well...GOOD LUCK|`|u53ISZoXaa	A green or a purple would make your eyes just pop! MAX has some pretty bold shades if you are daring, but covergirl has some good quality products for a good price!

Also black eyeliner helps blue eyes stand out. A light pink blush or a light brown blush looks really nice on pale skin. Sheer pink lip gloss also looks nice with the pale skin. Hope I helped!!

EUddyze0aa	Lancome is amazing. I was almost shocked at the difference when I got this mascara rather than the stuff I was using before.|`|pdO8hKqnaa	Covergirl Lashblast. Thats the only drugstore brand I would use (and no other covergirls besides lashblast or lashblast luze either!) You're soo right! They all clump your lashes together and flake off. You really get the mascara that you pay for, so don't go cheap. Anything from Sephora or Givenchy is definitely worth it, it makes your eyelashes long and pretty and won't ruin them.

2dya7YeKaa	Tapers are not meant to be worn in your ears, they are meant to slide directly through with your jewelry immediatly following.  Tapers are long and when you wear them as jewelry the weight is unevenly distributed.  The danger of doing this is even worse overnight as the tapers can snag on stuff.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you stretched too fast and tore your ears.  Downsize and wait for them to heal.  Here is the timeline you should be using for this:<br>  <br>  16g to 14g - 1 month<br>  14g to 12g - 1 month<br>  12g to 10g - 1.5 months<br>  10g to 8g - 2 months<br>  8g to 6g - 3 months<br>  6g to 4g - 3 month<br>  4g to 2g - 3 months<br>  2g to 0g - 4 months<br>  0g to 00g - 4 months<br>  <br>  If you don't downsize and let your ears heal you will for sure risk a blowout.  Downsize, wait a couple of weeks and then start doing daily oil massages to soften up your lobes and promote healthy tissue growth.  You can use Vitamin E Oil or Emu Oil for this. <br>  <br>  While your lobes are healing you should do sea salt soaks for the first week or two.  Treat the piercings like they are fresh.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!

z6ewtQubaa	White eyeliner on your waterline is supposed to make your eyes look bigger. Purple eyeliner/eyeshadow is supposed to complement brown eyes.|`|zbFJpyMyaa	Focus on slightly cat-eyed eyeliner to make your eyes look a little bigger, it gives the illusion of a longer/larger lashline, and for eyeshadow, try to go for softer tones like palettes of purples, soft pinks, gray and various browns work well for dark brown eyes.
tXs2meLPaa	London is a huge diverse multicultural city, don't think you can say "london people wear that" or "london people dress like that"<br>  Wear whatever you like but be confident and look confident. the most important thing :) good luck<br>  <br>  Well, since it's a fashion show, i'm guessing the style will be something towards glamorous. I think it's a good occasion to "dress up" (last time i went to a similar event me and my girlfriends organized a big dress-up and make up session at one of our places, exchanged clothes, tried new looks and such) choose something you feel comfortable in, for example if you're not used to heels then a flat ankleboot  would be perfect. just have fun :)<br>  My birthday is at the end of may aswell but i doubt i can convince my boyfriend(he lives in england) to come with me to a fashion show, lucky you!

iMrrBafPaa	It's just chain effect. If everybody else is wearing it, you probably want it too. So the consequence is every one is wearing the north face, especially in winter. Do they really worth that much money? don't think so, but you see, it costs more than the other brand because it's popular.<br>  <br>  north face do have stylish waterproof outdoor jackets. I love them. But they are sooooo expensive, like $300 each. If you don't have the money, try switch to Columbia TITANIUM. They have good quality too.|`|d8EYaNw2aa	yes they are and sorry i don't know where they are under a hundred dollars you might try like a sale at ***** or maybe get a coupon for ***** and use it on them then.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=2886009&view=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/family...</a>|`|5FLDzyhTaa	Yes they r too good.

5j1Uhg2Gaa	You are probably using the wrong type of makeup or putting on too much. Try using Neutrogena or mineral wear. Both are excellent makeup.  Also you need to moisturize your face with a lightweight moisturizer. Your skin might be dry.|`|f6f123d1de5cfc1006bad11b8d6e757aaa	use CG TruBlend makeup.<br>  thats what i use. then use the TruBlend powder after.<br>  it works wonders. haa
7FIe6xBAaa	my layers used to be about 2-3 inches long, and i couldn't pleat them at all.<br>  however, if you pleat the longer bits underneath the short layer and leave the layers hanging out that were too short to plait, that looks cute.|`|z3QsWmzpaa	my layers are quite short but when i put my hair in plaits i just back comb the top layers that dont fit into the plaits so it gives it abit of volume|`|31f512d5fa1d923173936aa0a41231deaa	plait it when its wet, and do a french plait so its starts from the route, also u need to add some moose or hair wax, something to keep it in place, but sadly you will still get some of the hair tryin to escape
zhzJoZ26aa	It's because you have oily skin. Blot your skin with bloting paper, blotting powder or a good powder.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Use powdered makeup. It makes your skin not look so shiny.|`|AA11169792	some parts of your face might be a little more shinier than others because those might be more oily than others. you should use a blotting sheet like clean and clears, or ELF's shine eraser (you get 100 sheets for only $1 and they're pretty good!) and you could also use cover up like blotting powder or NYC Smooth Skin Loose Face Powder or something along the lines of that. :)|`|cK6G9ilBaa	you have oily skin, so you just go down to the drug store and buy blotting sheets in the acne or skin care lane , its simple! and when you wash you face, like in the shower, just get some oil free soap|`|UTb5chyJaa	Seriously, use a little powder, just like women do to cover up a shiny nose, no one will be able to tell and it will take the shinyness away!!!
ZMWjdKfraa	I have been told that the stomach is very painful ,but the thing that would put me off is, have you ever seen what a stomach looks like after its been pregnant . In lots of cases not a pretty sight with lots of stretch marks and saggy ,wrinkly skin that wont go back with any amount of exercising .So if you were to fall in that category how would you feel about your tattoo if it was covered in stretch marks.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Really no more than anywhere else, so four or five maybe.|`|cPlDc7I1aa	i had one done to cover my appendix scar and it didnt really hurt any more than the other two i had done (on my shoulderblades).  Felt a bit weird whenever she went over the scar because i couldnt feel it but then the pain would kick in again when she went above or below the scar.  Also was a bit of a sick feeling when she went over my hip bone.  :os   It all depends on your pain threshold, but i wouldnt put it much above a 5.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Yes.  The outline on mine made me quite nauseous, and usually I have a very high pain threshold.<br>  <br>  Not to mention that it looks super tacky/cheesy, now that I'm 10 years older.   ;)<br>  <br>  The person above me is incorrect - fat has nothhing to do with pain when it comes to tattoos.  It's all in the concentration of nerves.  I have a wrist tattoo and a stomach tattoo (among several others) and the wrist barely even tickled.  My stomach was my most painful tattoo.|`|bH1DYr5saa	Yeah it hurts. I've got one on my belly. However, don't be scared, you got to expect it to hurt a bit. Yes, it's uncomfortable, but it is not unbearable - you will be able to sit through it easily enough. I've had my tongue pierced too and that hurt loads more then my tattoo! Like everyone else says, the outline seems to hurt most. The filling in is easy, so the worst part is over first. Don't let your fear of pain put you off it - it's really not that bad!|`|8KdWHcJdaa	I have heard that when a tat is done on bone (not much fat) like wrist for example it hurts more than a fatty place.<br>  All I can tell you from personal experience is that the outline is the killer, the infill is a doddle!! So the more intricate the more it will hurt.......but will look better in the long run.<br>  Good luck, I had my Scorpion done on my thigh 25 years ago, I don't regret it. It's like having your teeth out.......you soon get over it........but with a tat at least you have something to show for the pain. lol..:)|`|gnoXQEklaa	YES. dont let anyone tell you differently. My first and only tattoo is on my stomach, and it hurt. But honestly, I'm sure all tattoos are painful. And I don't regret it. If you want it on your stomach then you'll endure the pain, because the pain is temporary. The tattoo is for life.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc141/mwills228/TATTOO/l_4334f2244b06be3c474c1b759cd8646a.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc141...</a>|`|laMNHVhBaa	WELL TATTOOS REALLY HURT ON THE BONY AREAS but like the belly I think it didn't hurt when i got little tattoo diamonds around my belly i didn't hurt so um yea that's all i know but if ur sensitive it may hurt a little but the outline may sting allot but the color burns just a little so UM yea PEACE|`|o4Xt90Qzaa	Yes, it hurts. I used to have a tribal butterfly on my stomach - got it covered up with a koi fish, water, flowers, and rocks - my ENTIRE stomach is tattooed. I would say it was one of my most painful ones, probably an 8 out of 10.<br>  <br>  But strangely enough, some parts tickled a litle... but it mostly hurt.|`|QAewZewYaa	yes they hurt...but as I only have one on my belly I can't compare it to any other place!<br>  Felt like I was being sliced open with a scalpel right up to my ribs. Glad I did it though and want another, but on my back next time :)<br>  <br>  Bit like childbirth...hurts a lot but you still have another ;)|`|5B02WP2waa	Well, belly is a rather delicate piece of skin, also it's not very 'stiff'. It will hurt, but this also depends on how much pain can you take. It'll hurt alot at first but you'll get used to it quickly.|`|OtWnDh79aa	It really all depends on how well you handle pain. But sense your stomach is muscle and fat, it will probably be rather painful. At least a 5 +.

You can try using dark brown "glaze" that you can get at drugstores. John Freida makes one. I've heard of people using strong black coffee or tea to stain their hair but I've never actually seen anyone do it.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Some people use coffee beans but I'm not sure how to do it.

This comment I presume was unsolicited, and if you cannot say something nice, don't say anything at all.<br>  <br>  But like I always say, young people try to use words to hurt others, and control how and what people feel about themselves.

It great to have a plain outfit and funky it up by wearing shoes that pop...You can even wear a red bag if needed...try to make sure that the bag matches well with the shoe or you can even wear a bag that has a tiny bit of red on it, your preference...but a red bag is not needed!! Just last night I wore dark skinny jeans red paten leather shoes white tank top and a black blazer over it....EVeryone gave me compliments....a real fashionist knows that wearing red shoes red shirt red belt and a red bag...is a fashion faux pas....thats a no no...red shoes are made to make a dull or even dressy outfit pop....i would never wear a red dress and red shoes lol....I have fun with those shoes!!!

8IqgfXl9aa	Okay, first of all...freckles are beautiful and natural-looking, so DON'T GET RID OF THEM! Red, blotchy skin isn't, however. Just use like Bare Minerals Bronzer to even out your skin. <br>  Use the Clinique Moisurizing kit-thingy! It works really well! Or, use Neutrogena Moisturizing Pads or try Noxema Anti-Bacterial Wash (it makes your skin look REALLY healthy and beautiful)......<br>  hope I helped!|`|5bg0hEQIaa	WHAT?!?! Oh my god I loveeeeeeeee freckles. I wish I had some.

Don't cover them up!!!!!|`|EslnT1p9aa	This sounds weird, but if you start with a light covering of zinc oxide, which you can find in the first aid aisle, this will cover the majority of your freckles and help camouflage the redness. It's also medicinal for your skin. Next, there is a foundation called "DermaBlend" for people with bad facial skin discoloration. (It comes in a small round pot.) It provides heavy, but natural looking coverage. <br>  To fade freckles gradually over time, choose a skin lightener and apply it religiously for 6 weeks and you will notice dramatic improvement. <br>  Now, for the part you don't want to hear: The others are right--freckles can be really attractive on a girl, and many boys like them. But...until YOU like them on yourself, I hope my suggestions help. By the way, in my opinion, Rimmell products are garbage. I used to live in England and the company Rimmell started as a cheap cosmestic that only sold in dollar stores. I doubt they have improved much since then. Good luck to you!|`|OK3UMa28aa	OMG...There is nothing wrong with having frekkle, just because i dont have doesnt mean i dont think it's beautiful..i think those are marks of beauty and natural unique beauty...but good luck|`|A0o8soNeaa	please don't cover your freckles, they are lovely!!   <br>  <br>  if you have red blotches, try phys formula.
jtFMkZkAaa	Herbal essences shampoo for colored hair, and herbal essences dry hair conditioner but only use the conditioner for your ends and do not put on the scalp! because it will make your scalp greasy. Leave the conditioner on for 10 minites and wash out!

Not like Super Cuts or any petty chain like that, but a decent salon where people have been trained well and know what they're talking about. The same products are sold in the lower priced chain salons, but they're less likely to have the knowledge you're looking for to help you rather than make a sale on a spendy item. BUT you never know, sometimes you luck out and they are VERY knowledgeable. So I guess make your best judgment ;]<br>  <br>  Any kind of shampoo you can buy at a local store is most likely to put residue or other things into your hair. Herbal Essences, Pantene Pro-V for color (this one is VERY bad for your hair), etc. This is why salon products are so crazy expensive.. they don't do any of that. They tend to work exactly how they are supposed to. <br>  <br>  So go to a salon and ask them about it, and they will recommend the perfect thing for you. DON'T buy something from a local store if you're serious about getting something good for your hair.|`|PW5H6wO3aa	bumble and bumble is amazing, but it is veryyyy expensive, $18-25 for and 8oz bottle of shampoo or conditioner, but it works wonders, <br>  <br>  they have other great stuff to, like what you use before flat ironing your hair, and leave in conditioner, and stuff that makes you look like your hair has been on the beach all day, b&b is amazzzing !|`|Oh9wfPFeaa	diva stmulating shampoo and conditioner...<br>  i work at a hair salon and we use it on people with really dry scalps i even use it myself. i dont know if they sell it anywhere but baltimore cause thats where she started her line ao i dnt know if your here or anywhere else|`|vjn03B5haa	i tried boots own last time and its really good so i use it now but your hair can get used to the same shampoo all the time so try to change every few months.|`|OMViSIh1aa	Rid lice shampoo...|`|fT5hUUOiaa	tresemme|`|Z9OJcpC1aa	well as a woman of colour i like pantene it does wonders|`|HD1cyyh1aa	A girl at work uses Redken shampoo & conditioner and she colors her hair professionally.

FZRZFusuaa	Cons-  The pay is usually based on commission so you never know exactly what your pay check is going to look like.  <br>  <br>  You will be working Saturdays and mainly evening hours when people are getting off work  - this will be your busiest time and the best time to make money<br>  <br>  Generally salons do not offer benefits (health insurance etc.)<br>  <br>  Pros -  It is an amazing creative field and the sky is the limit with pay.<br>  <br>  You can be your own boss one day and rent a chair or own your own salon.<br>  <br>  You get all your services done for free<br>  <br>  The hours can be very flexible if you have a family etc..<br>  <br>  <br>  I have been doing hair for over 9 years and still love it.  Someone else stated with the economy it is not a good field to get into but I disagree.  We have not seen a decline with the economy. (afterall hair doesn't stop growing due to the economy)   In fact I think our looks are the one thing people want to keep up because it makes them feel better when things might be tough for them.|`|4F034xtCaa	Pro: You can always find a job easier then others, you set your own hrs at most places, ware what you want.<br>  <br>  Con: On your feet all day|`|DmiTytlkaa	With the economy going down, people are going to be saving money for other things than getting their hair done. Most cosmotologists work on commision and tips, which is never reliable. Ever. Also, every girl wants to do hair and make up, so it's kind of competitive. <br>  <br>  90% of the people I've known in this field have left it to do something else. <br>  <br>  However, it is a labor of love, and for some, that's all that matters.

puLtMrNIaa	Try using a black or black brown WATERPROOF MASCARA. It will last through your rough daily activity and give your eyes some pop to them! Also make sure you have a good skin care regiment, so your skin is healthy and soft. Try using <br>  <br>  Aveeno POSITIVELY RADIANT TRIPLE BOOSTING SERUM. <br>  <br>  It's a little like a moisturizer but thinner. <br>  Use it before bed and it should brighten <br>  up your skin and make it beautiful!|`|Pl7J5HFMaa	I have really blue eyes also, so i can see where you are coming from. i also play sports, so i understand that too. if you WANT to don't use black eyeliner, use either brown or copper. copper looks beautiful with really blue eyes. i don't wear makeup either, but the eyeliner would look great on you. and tell your friends that you don't like wearing it, it takes too much time, and it pointless with the sports you play. also tell them that you think the eyeliner would take away from your eyes. <br>  i love my blue eyes too!<br>  ~gabby <3|`|gLXzVbm8aa	dont worry about your friends you dont need any foundation but you can put a little blush, eyeshadow, mascara and eyeliner as long as nothing is black|`|Uzayv72kaa	i would just wear mascara. i don't like wearing makeup either and i'm pretty tan with clear skin. all, or most, of my friends wear makeup but i hate it, so sometimes i just wear some mascara to make them leave me alone about it.|`|KDXisAOlaa	well you can get facewash, it prevents breakouts so you will continually not have to wear foundation.  <br>  <br>  Make up tips: before applying any type of make up to your lids, make sure they are moisturized.|`|Lasx21sbaa	i would just wear mascara cuz i have really green eyes like you have blue eyes. if you wear a little bit of bronzer it could brighten up your face.|`|SmFcDx4waa	my wife has very pretty skin and eyes too - she just recently started wearing just some light eyeshadow and maybe a little blush - it looks nice|`|AbN6Natmaa	there is EYESHADOW that you can get to make your blue eyes look BETTER. and maybe you dont want anything else. i like i think...garnier (hhowever u spl it) foaming cleanser. looks good too! and dove face moisturizer...like maybe TAUPE WOULD BE NICE FOR BLUE EYES! :) hope i helped!|`|mdOocxZ2aa	you sound a lot like me. you should wear brown eyeliner. It makes blue eyes look amazing. trust me.|`|jAVTSup1aa	Girl if you are blessed to have pretty much acne free skin you don't want to clog your pores with make up. By wearing more make up it could clog your pores and cause you to break out! So if you don't feel its neccesary to wear makeup go for it! Don't let your friends pressure you into wearing makeup. If you don't have much of a problem with acne you could try a generic brand, like St. Ives or Biore. Well if you wear eyeliner (black) it will help make your blue eyes pop. Maybe a little eyeshadow, somehting light though since you don't want to take away from your eyes. Greys, browns, creams, subtle colors nothing loud. <br>  Hope i helped you!

b98399109be318e3b79301e0534af71caa	you post your question in the wrong category. =)<br>  but i will try my best to answer your question.<br>  <br>  first of all, i think she might be insecure as well as afraid as she is older than you for quite a huge gap of age difference as well as the difference in the lifestyle (she has a son). She might have feelings for you but she might also have doubts whether the relationship might last or not. <br>  Firstly, you are younger than her so her thinking might be more mature than yours. <br>  Second, she might be afraid that you might eventually fall for someone else younger.<br>  Third, she has a son already. she might want a stable relationship as she might be looking for a father for her son.<br>  Fourth, she might think that you are way to young to support her and her son and she might be looking for a long steady relationship that leads to marriage.<br>  <br>  please dont give up, but do assure her that you are ready to held those responsibilities.<br>  if you are not ready, then i suggest you to not pursue a relationship with her.<br>  <br>  good luck. :)|`|KDXisAOlaa	nope keep trying and someday it'll allll work out for all of us when the earth ends in 2012..hahahaha just kidding.|`|mdOocxZ2aa	um, i dont think shes playing games. shes almost 30 with a kid.

0VgE9W71aa	I got mine done a few days ago also. From what I've been told, read, and experienced so far is that it takes about 3 or so months to heal. It doesnt hurt in the shower, I just let the water run over the back of it but not hit it. And so far mine is still hurting. Ive read on average it can hurt for a week or two. I still experience some bleeding when I clean it with Saline, but my piercer recommended sea salt soaks twice a day and to keep a spray bottle with sea salt water handy. Be careful when sleeping because it does irritate and hurt more in the morning if you sleep on it. It's okay to move around when you're cleaning it as long as you're hands are clean, its a little bit of discomfort but it isn't painful.|`|0YneW8ORaa	I don't actually have a conch piercing but I just happen to know a lot of crap about piercings in general. It should stop hurting in a couple more hours, but it'll hurt if you touch or move it for about another week could be longer though. Probably takes around 3 months to heal which is the norm for most piercings with a few exceptions. It shouldn't hurt when you get in the shower unless you are letting the water hit it directly. You need to move it only when you are cleaning it, yes it's gonna hurt but it helps it heal. Make sure to clean with anti-bacterial soap and sea-salt soaks. Conch piercings are strange and I like most strange things so yes they are cute.

Just rub it on your face like astringent and it will kill that extra stuff right off.|`|F37Bi5YVaa	Using a acne scar removal cream. Creams like Oxy10, Klear Action Acne Treatment or Skinoren Acne Cream are will known for being the best acne scar removal creams with proven results. Following a cosmetic medical procedure called dermabrasaion. The surface of the skin with the scars is removed through a process named abrasion. I don't recommend this way to get rid of acne scars because it's very painful.

wNZ95AK3aa	your cheekbones will become more noticable if you loose weight and you will hav a gaunt look to your face.|`|nod3Ne9yaa	NO, the cheekbones are a part of the cranium and they will not be affected. Your cheeks might though.|`|of049X1waa	No, your cheekbones are actually bones.  THey will not change with weight loss... if anything, they will be more prominent because your cheeks will be thinner.
LRJmHA7vaa	I hate to burst your bubble. But, you do not know how to color hair or you would not have the mess you have. Hair is not a wall that you can just paint over. Putting color stripper on your hair, you bleached it. So now you have at least 3 processes on your hair. Im surprised you have any hair left. That being said. You have no real choice since you don't want to go to the salon,except to go darker. However if you do, please don't do anything else to your hair for at least 6 months and condition, condition, condition.|`|EeGlkABPaa	i'd suggest waiting a few days before you dye your hair agian. When you do the easiest thign to do would be to dye it a dark-ish brown and try to even it out so that there wont me lighter patches<br>  good luck with it!|`|LHnVjJqsaa	use an alkaline shampoo and hot oil treatments to gently and slowly but surely get rid of it|`|YB63U3Pgaa	yes i'd wait a couple of days, stripping your hair wont just take out your un-natural colour it takes out your natural colour.<br>  <br>  No you dont dye your roots first, althought they are lighter they wont take as long because it's natural hair with no other products on it, Do your mid section, then end and do your roots last. <br>  <br>  You will probably find that even with a permanent colour it will fade and you will need to redo it again so those red tones are going to come through.|`|ovPfkHSCaa	Looking for the hot short hairstyles for 2009? You don't have look too far. While long hair abounds (and is beautiful), short hair is "in" and the best styles for 2009 are right in front of us!.<br>  <br>  More Info Here:-|`|vSwhvuk1aa	1) You do not have to wait to dye your hair again. Although, you may want to if you have a dry sensitive scalp.<br>  2) You would typically start dyeing at the roots and then work your way down.<br>  3) Use a dye color that is not too different than your natural color, because if you do you're hair will look very fake and your roots will be darker than the rest of your hear.<br>  4) To completely get rid of the tint, use color that is not near the reddish color.|`|MUo0V2P6aa	well when i first saw your post i was going to say to strip all the color out and use an ash based color (ash keeps  your hair from turning brassy orange). I'm miffed at why it still turned orange. As for the roots being lightest that is because you always have to start at the roots first. I would go get a color that is definately darker then let your hair alone for a while, reason being is you have double processed your hair and you dont want it to melt.|`|yeS81RlSaa	If I were you I would choose a dark color to dye your hair. Maybe a chestnut brown or something. After that maybe you could put in some highlights over it. But if you do choose to dye again I believe they say to wait about 2 weeks before you dye your hair again to keep it healthy. The only other suggestion I have for you is to go to the salon and get it stripped out (which is costly and you said you wouldn't do this). I dyed my hair black on accident on time using a dark brown and had to have my salon strip the dye out and re-color it. It costs about $150. Whew!
JhJXKRkOaa	No, they are to expensive, there are other good brands out there, that are cheep and cheerful.|`|kknSPYxKaa	Yes they are worth the money.<br>  They work as a really good base for your eyeshadow, almost as if they are a primer.<br>  The paint pots are supposed to be used as a base.  They are really creamy, they don't crease, and they make your eye shadow stay in place and make them really stand out.<br>  If you are going to get a neutral color, use it as a primer.<br>  If you are getting  bright color, use it to make your eyeshadow pop!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :D|`|jH2NZTCuaa	i have both of these colors, and yes I think they are worth it. <br>  they last awhile, and look great.<br>  I would get Bare study..|`|QeALCWbqaa	yep and ask em

6aEhPcDAaa	A lot of mousse foundations seem to have a good airbrushed effect (like Maybelline), and some other ones that I think give a good airbrushed look with foundation, the Diorskin Airflash ( I think its called) is a bit pricey but totally worth it, it gives you an amazing airbrushed look without being heavy or looking caked on.  For spray foundation, put a towel around your neck and hair so it doesn't get there <3<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|Y67BsXXwaa	max factor miracle touch. its a liquid illusion foundation! i use it, it works wonders. although slightly costy compared to other foundations at around ￡11 but is most definatly worth it. but u have to remember to keep your skin healthy this will help.

uWUSpzOsaa	depending on how your hair is, you can just crunch it... like put a lot of mouse in your hair when its when its wet and keep scrunching it... once it drys it looks like your hair is naturally curly and makes your hair soft and shiny...personally i use gel and hairspray because i like the hard look it makes my hair feel more in place... you should get bangs so that when ur hair is curly the bangs will give a little style to your hair..  believe me i get bored with the same old straight look too .. but if your hair wont curl with the mousse or gel.. try using you hair straightener to curl it... what u have to do is put the straightener to the top of your hair..wrap the strand of hair around the straightener hold on to the piece of hair and pull down... it took me a while to learn how to do it BUT it looks amazing|`|EeGlkABPaa	you could try just pulling it back into a cute ponlytail or putting it in french plaits.|`|yEPQO79maa	if your hair isn't as healthy you should deep condition it occasionally to restore it to its natural state.

EX. When I put my hair in a ponytail I wrap the hair elastic around 3 times, so for this hairstyle I wrap it around twice. <br>  Then pull out the hair elastic about an inch or an inch and a half. Then just let it fall, some pieces will fall out and it'll be really loose. After I just added a headband and voila! IDK but it works for me!<br>  p.s. I usually switch it to just one side so its a loose side ponytail with a headband!|`|qfgQDPIRaa	It is bad for your hair to straiten it all the time so that is why your hair is unhealthy.

But remember, that's just my opinion. Look at a mirror, and then at the picture, it's your choice, not anyone elses.
9qxQtLYTaa	i suggest a powder compact foundation because you can take it with you to school or wherever, and touch ups are easy- clinique perfectly real compact makeup ir rele good because its good for your skin, and even helps breakouts, and it also comes in a variety or shades that gives u a better chance of finding a perfect match. the compact it comes in is also nice b.c it has a seperate compartment for the applicator. mineral makeup is also nice, but they usually come in loose powder form which can be rele messy and quite a hassle. liquid foundation is better for dry skin, and if u have acne nd easily breakout, ur most likely more oily, so liquid isnt the best for ur skin<br>  <a href="http://www.clinique.ca/templates/products/sp_shaded.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY4900&PRODUCT_ID=PROD6944" rel="nofollow">http://www.clinique.ca/templates/product...</a><br>  ?|`|AA10700596	definately covergirl aquasmooth foundation its the best it covers up everything and ive gotten so many compliments on my skin looking great! good luck!     =]|`|1wGJ0iziaa	well, powder and foundation...first put on foundation, then powder lightly.

But I would say around ￡30.00.<br>  <br>  I go to a very reputable salon and pay this price in my city centre. So for a good job I would say that that's about right.|`|0BX1yFGuaa	Beautician!

iq1nBNtDaa	weird, i had the opposite, thick in front, but fragile in back. try pantene pro v, not the knock off store brands of pro vitamin shampoo, but the real thing. also you really should limit use of flatironing and trim regularly. hope this helps!|`|pEccQrcTaa	okay you're going to think this is insane. but my mothers a hairdresser and you can trust me <br>  <br>  use "mane and tails" shampoo. you can find it at walmart. it is horse shampoo but dont be scared, because if you read the label, humans can use it as well. it is amazing shampoo and improves any type of hair. <br>  the part about thick hair in the back and thinner in the front may be because 1. your hair dresser has thinned out your hair. or 2. you use the iron too much in the front, because that's where you see the most of your hair obviously, and you try to make it as straight as possible.<br>   also, it might be the kind of straightener you have. most people have chi's. if you use a chi, i strongly suggest getting the "nano-croc" straightener. it is amaZiing. i have very curly hair and it only takes one time to straighten perfectly. i love it <br>  <br>  hope i helped:)
GOsRusM9aa	Umm...I'm not sure if it would work for your chin, but with your cheeks if you have a narrow face, you blend pressed powder or foundation out from the center of your face. If you have a wide face, you blend in from the outside of your face.

154dzJ1Faa	You just need to separate out the strands you want dark, and apply colour to only those sections.  Black is a very hard colour to wear, and doesn't always work the best. I'd suggest a very dark brown for best results.<br>  <br>  The tricky part is on finding just the right places to put the dark strands.  Too  much and that looks wrong.  Too little can be fixed up by adding more.  Wrong place... it is really hard to remove.<br>  <br>  Find a qualified professional and ask for advice.  It's much cheaper to have someone trained do this for you than attempt it yourself.

They have so many beads that would be exactly what you are looking for.  It will look just as good as store bought and will be less expensive...plus you can put your personal touch on it.  A lot of bead shops hold classes too so you can learn and get it done in like an hour! good luck and have fun|`|e758cd941c16b75c2db40517c03fcc64aa	your right silver is to bright and white and it doesnt match the yellow/pink gems. so try to find yellow/pink earrings that are diamond shape but if you cant find any go gold.|`|0j2E9WPEaa	brown<br>  or silver.<br>  don't wear earrings, get big hair that cover your ears.<br>  <br>  and wear a necklace that makes a statement.<br>  <br>  :D|`|tYgxvtFHaa	Okay, I know this will sound weird, but go to icings or claires to get your jelewry! they have like the most beautiful things to go with that dress. Just dont tell them where you got them 4rm!!!|`|TJ6Q53jhaa	yellow earings....thats all i can tell ya.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	Sliver.<br>  <br>  <br>  i don't like it sorry.|`|gHUalk8Xaa	I think it would look nice if you stayed with yellow toned jewelry? Maybe a cz canary yellow?
FZRZFusuaa	Yes black hair looks good with tan/olive skin.  But since we are approaching spring you may want to stick with a lighter color - the sun will lighten up your color naturally any way.  Rule of thumb - lighter in the spring and summer - darker in the fall and winter.  But - no one has to play by the rules right?!?  Do want you want to - it's hair color and meant to be fun!!
g6easyBFaa	How much cheaper do you want?<br>  <br>  Remember, this is not just a simple, cheap, wrap-around woman's skirt.  A kilt has a considerable amount of cloth in it with heavy pleating.  <br>  <br>  An average woman's skirt may have 3 - 4 ft of cloth.  The cheapest kilts may only have 4 yards (12 ft) of fabric, and more traditionally styled kilts can have over 8 yards (24 ft).  Add to that the time it takes to arrange the pleats, sew them down, press them in, and manufacture the rest of it and $50 is dirt cheap.|`|WewCtMpzaa	Your in Paki-Made Kilt territory. You can find some low-end scottish shops that sell these things, that look like large loomed yarn, than tartan, but they look good at a distance.<br>  <br>  I would add about $40 to your budget and move up to SportKilt (www.sportkilt.com), or you could move up another $50 and get a UtilityKilt (a UK for short) if you like alternative looking kilts. What makes these kilts nice is that they can purchased with pockets. I really like the sportkilts because they look authentic, but they are very great just play around in, plus have pockets. Traditional kilts require the sporran, which is cool looking in formal or semi-dress, but around the house they are overkill. Plus they are not roomy enough for all your possibles such as wallet, cellphone, car keys and all the little things you would typically carry in your pants. I find driving with the sporran on requires spinning the sporran to the side or taken off in and out of the car.<br>  <br>  Check eBay as well, but make sure you size yourself around the hip at bellybutton, and then to the knee if you want it to fit. Kilts are in absolutes, so if you measure 38 with a tape measure, that is your size at the hip.|`|wqGVJmaTaa	Try Here: <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fhomepage.html&tag=tubeblog-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a> <br>  Or try searching ebay <br>  <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?type=1&campid=5336006644&toolid=10001&customid=" rel="nofollow">http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-...</a> <br>  Good Luck

6RCQfqlAaa	i really would love to darling,<br>  but you didn't tell us which one is yours.<br>  /:
1Z0D8Pyoaa	it's gonna hurt no matter where you get it. but, that's not a real bad place. fleshy parts of the body tend to hurt less than places where the skin is thin (i.e: ribs).|`|AA11982228	OK, mine hurt like the devil, but maybe that's just me.|`|7eaf5c689c77b9c042b4be96ab16b8abaa	I have them on both legs above the ankle bone, but on the outside.  Didn't hurt that bad at all.|`|WqVawp0Kaa	All tattoos hurt so I assume you mean on a scale from 1-10.  i'de give it a 5-7. The more fat under the skin the less it hurts. (A tatt behind your ear is one of the worst because there's no fat, just skin and bone and if you cant handle a tatt on your calf you're a weenie.) If they hit bone or you're really skinny it might hurt a little worse. You should be able to take it, just don't worry about it and you'll be fine. If you've never been tatted before and are nervous, drink some orange juice and eat a good meal prior to your session so you dont pass out. Have fun and enjoy it... i think it feels kinda good ;)|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	Any tattoo is gonna hurt but they hurt most where there are nerve endings (wrists, ankles, back-waistline) and anywhere that is tender. Try putting on a topical creme that will numb it. Most tattoo shops have it..|`|Lxof5QrQaa	idk but I wouldnt get one there|`|IS1F69mraa	Pain is all relative. I have that area tattooed on both my legs. One was so painless I hardly felt it, and the other I went into a mild state of shock. Everyone is different and every experience is different. Generally speaking, the fleshier the body part, the less painful it will be. But remember, pain is only momentary!|`|yXUtl0aHaa	anywhere it can reach the muscle, the place where most people could just fall asleep while getting a tattoo is on there ***, butt, what ever, somewhere where its fat, but on there, that is going to hurt, because of the bone and muscle still being there and remember hun, all your nerves are in your feet somewhere. OUCH
JZabWXGpaa	Heres a website that will make any of their dresses in the type of closure that you want.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mybigfatbeautifulwedding.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mybigfatbeautifulwedding.com</a><br>  <br>  They make hidden zipper, lace up, hidden zipper with covered buttons or they can even make a true covered button closure.  They will do this to almost any of the dresses on their website and I understand that there is no additional charge, it's totally custom up to you.|`|MrizzMDhaa	I'm not answering your question I realise but just a word of caution -allow LOADS of time to do these buttons - and make sure there is a person without false nails on to do them up for you! I was nearly late for my own wedding as me and all five bridesmaids had buttons at the back of the dresses and we all had false nails on.<br>  Seriously though loads of dresses have them.|`|WctqCNpBaa	go somewhere and get a custom dress made if u want to spend $$$
wUIJSSJlaa	Depends a lot on the shop but I would say between $130 and $200|`|rFMRgHTdaa	i would say 150.00+ it depends on the artist.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	...<br>  Smaller than that<br>  <br>  $80 - $150<br>  <br>  Depending on exact size, where you go, and shop minimum|`|2dya7YeKaa	Unless the tattoo artist who is going to do the work magically stumbles on your question, all of the answers you get here will only be guesses.  <br>  <br>  Go to the shop where you are going to get tattooed and ask them for a quote.|`|Tj56EVaDaa	70$ around here|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	Ok ew! But i'd say around 200+|`|tHsI8h93aa	errm about ￡90|`|e2NQUmusaa	Go talk to an tattoo artist in your area, depending on if you get color or not, I would charge about $80.|`|o4Xt90Qzaa	Maybe $100-$150

7zrsIK9Paa	Your alright but you are a bit flabby like the first person said.|`|9dtrWO5laa	normal|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Neither...you are very slim but you DO need to tone up before you can be considered "fit." x|`|AYct1ZFRaa	You are not flabby at all!!!!!

TudZYPN5aa	That's cheating|`|4e2e48971027d3515e35387bf29959f4aa	No. Most times when you have an online coupon it is for just that, online. Some stores have printable coupons but I have never seen one for AE.|`|9oAwDLa4aa	don't think so. go to retailmenot.com and do a search for AE.com and you can find online coupons. they'll want you to pay for it b/f they ship it to the store.|`|nBd2r8XLaa	I think they'll figure that out.|`|CfFntr5Haa	no o-o why would you order online, when you can go buy it, that'd be stupid.. just call them o-o what is ae???? !_!
oE0JCu89aa	Definitely black, it can be worn with any outfit for any occasion. I just think guys who wear pink shoes are trying too hard for attention.
teNUDFtGaa	shoe stores in the mall sell em, thats where i bought mine|`|JGMWR6wVaa	Marshall's and TJ Max definately sell them.  Journey's sell them and there are plenty of EcKo stores.  Have you tried on eBay?|`|AA10839292	UM the place I got them from is the ecko store located in Gaithersburg MD in Rio shopping center. But they are not cheap. They do have sales but only go during that time. The red ones are in High demands. I suggest going online.
AA11104098	use cold water when done, as cold as you can take it....warm or hot water open your pores and you obviously don't want that, cold water closes them, therefore your skins feels smoother....you can also try to pluck them with tweezers, I usually do that with t he bikini area and shave everything else. Good Luck!|`|jER0X5OPaa	Shave downwards, instead of upwards, against the grain, until your body gets more used to it.

QMbxBynZaa	hm, about the contacts, try explaining it to your mom that you want contacts because you are self conscience with your glasses on and you cant see with out them. tell her that times have changed and it would help with your self esteem (even if its not true it'll help.) if you got them. also maybe offer to help pay for them ! :) <br>  & for the makeup, you're only thirteen, so remember this, right now is when A lot of girls your age are wearing alot of make up and globbing that junk on, and in a few years when it really matters how you look they'll'l be old news. if you wait to wear alot of makeup, like glob it on w/ eye shadow and whatnot, you'll be more noticeable in a few years (again, when it really matters) again, since you're only thirteen, i say you wear lighter, more natural colors, like brown. maybe a little brown eye liner and maybe some cover up & MAYBE some brown mascara. :) alsoooo, since you can barely see out of the one eye, expirament at home, <br>  do your makeup and look in a mirror and see which side is thicker, longer, or whatever you have trouble doing, and then know that when you do that side you have to remember to make it a little thicker, or whatverrr :)<br>  hope i helped ! <3|`|a9fbb1057a4fb13556557ea87af2cd41aa	My mom is blind in one eye as well, and she had the same problem. <br>   She only uses light eyeshadow colors (creams, whites, browns etc.) and blends everything A LOT! Makeup never has to be perfect! <br>   I would suggest a blending brush like the Sonia Kashuk Blending brush (availble at Target) or the MAC 216.(maccosmetics.com) For eyeliner try smudging it out so it doesn't matter if you didnt draw a perfectly straight. Some good <br>  Blendable/ Smudgeable liners are Covergirl mechancical eyepencil (not positive of the exact name) or on the higher end Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliner. (sephora)<br>  <br>  Have fun with your makeup, hope this helps!
dY6HroZ3aa	Hot oil treatment is generally used to condition your hair. It also repairs the damage caused to the hair due to coloring or straightening of hair.<br>  Heat the oil in microwave oven for 10 sec. and apply the oil with a small cotton ball.  Massage your scalp gently for 5-10 min.s<br>  <br>  For best results apply in the night, leave it overnight and wash with a shampoo next day. <br>   <br>  And yes it makes your hair shiny if you use it regularly...once in a week.|`|qFL8AhJJaa	-I Do Hair;;so Hot Oil Makes Your Hair Really Straight and Makes It Look Like U Have A Pern;;And Yes Once U Use Hot Oil U Wanna Use A Mild Shampoo After;;

Take a couple of tablespoons of oil and sort of lather it through your hair.  If your hair is dry on the ends but greasy on top, skip the your scalp and just massage it into the ends. Then let it sit for 15 minutes and then rinse out thoroughly (no shampoo!) Your hair might feel a little greasy after wards, so you might want to experiment a couple more times till you find the right amount of oil for your hair.<br>  If you want shiner hair as well, try 2 tablespoons oil to a ratio of 1 tablespoon honey and massage into your hair. Let it sit for 10 minutes then rinse thoroughly without the use of shampoo.<br>  Eggs are actually amazing for your hair. It's one of the best natural hair conditioners.  Just beat one egg and ? cup water. Massage it into your hair and let it sit for 10 minutes. Then rinse out of your hair with lukewarm water.  Maybe even a little cooler than that or else you'll get cooked eggs in your hair... Literally :D<br>  Hope this helped a lot and good luck!

AXCV7fNfaa	Hey!  I have two nieces your age and one of them had this same exact change she wanted to make with her style.  Ok, so you said you wanted shorter, choppy hair.  Looking at your picture, i would suggest a more A-line type hairstyle where it's shorter in back and long in the front.  I think it'd be a really good hairstyle on you: <br>  <a href="http://cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload//6000/300/90/9/6399.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cdn-write.demandstudios.com/uploa...</a><br>  <br>  Weight:  Ok, i know that Hollywood makes us all want to be "skinny" and perfect.  BUT the reality of life is that you are who you are.  And your ULTIMATE goal should be to be HEALTHY.  So things to do to be healthy and feel good?  Start running (maybe join track?) or go on fast paced walks, or participate in a sport of some kind to stay healthy and fit.  Healthy and fit don't mean being "SKINNY."  We all have different shapes that are natural and are just how we are built!  But we all can be HEALTHY regardless.  Try to eat fruits and vegetables and whole grains and healthy proteins (like fish and turkey) and if you do your cardio and eat good, your body will be and look healthy!  And you'll feel good.  I know healthy foods can be expensive though, but just DO YOUR BEST, that's all we can do!<br>  <br>  New Clothes:  Well, you've got beautiful eyes and so IF you can afford contacts then try them out (see if you can get a test pair from the optometrist to see if you like them?) If not, then your glasses are JUST FINE!  They just stand in front of your beautiful eyes!  And i don't know about your style really, like what you feel comfortable wearing and such.  There are stores like urbanoutfitters.com, zenuq.com, forever21.com where you can get stuff that helps you be an INDIVIDUAL and stand out in a good way.  Try some skinny jeans (even if you don't consider yourself "skinny")  Thrift stores are also great places to find one of a kind items that would help express your personal style.  If you have any more questions, just ask me.  Not knowing that much about your style, etc. is kind of hard to tell you where to shop.  If you tell me more i can possibly suggest different styles, etc.  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|KUiVzQDFaa	you look rele pretti. for changes u should get a scene HAiRCUT. not style or youll look like a clone . hair color- get some nice higlights any color, or dye your hair off- black. umm for clothes im biased toward the emo side of things but if youre losing weight i'd maybe reccomend some skinnies and a few good hoodies. makeup-- face powder,eyeshadow(vibrant) and some eyeliner. maybe get colored contacts, watever u feel comfortable with.<br>  <br>  hope i helped ^.^|`|acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	Since you want change, try getting contacts if you don't have them already. A simple alteration like that can change how people perceive you. I don't know how short you consider too short. But, I do think your hair is too plain and boring. It's sleek and shiny, which is a good thing Yet, it doesn't seem to have much style. Depending on what style you want, short hair could look good with your face shape. Keep it at a moderate length and don't dye it. I don't think any other hair color would match, especially not blonde. Add reddish highlights if you ever want to dye it.

vVka4ZA0aa	Okay, sounds like more of your insecurities are psychological, but if you really dislike certain things about yourself, you can try changing them with natural or store bought remedies. However, for things like bone structure, you may just need to learn to accept your flaws and love them. Everyone has flaws, they're what make us, us.<br>  <br>  For your fingernails, if you don't want to opt to get tips and acrylic (i have crap fingernails too, so I just get them done) try to stop biting them if you do. Also, try using dietary supplements like Phyto from Sephora to help with your hair and nails.<br>  If you don't like your eyebrows, try getting them professionally shaped and waxed. A professional will be able to look at the shape of your face and help shape your eyebrows to suit your looks. Then, you can just keep up with your shape by home waxing or tweezing.<br>  For your bags, try sleeping with your head slightly elevated to keep all of your blood from getting into your face and making it puffy.<br>  It's been said that placing tea bags on your eyes like you would cucumbers helps as well. But under eye bags are unfortunately part of your body and even surgery can't keep them away forever. So try some home remedies and even hemeroid cream for a quick fix when going to a social event. Also, when applying base make up, blend under your eyes, maybe even try using a shade lighter for underneath.<br>  <br>  Also, one good thing that helps a lot of people feel better, is adrenaline... Get your blood pumping with some exercise or anything a little strenuous. This will release endorphins which gives you a natural good feeling high.|`|AORcLwTNaa	um ok. no one is perfect.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	To feel beautiful and confident:<br>  <br>  1. Be grateful for what you have;<br>  2. Focus on other people, not yourself;<br>  3. Don't feel you have to please everyone, because that's impossible<br>  4. Enjoy your life- it's over before you know it!|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	You yourself asked you want to feel confident and beautiful (not look).<br>  <br>  Its your own attitude and thought process that would make you feel confident and beautiful.<br>  <br>  To look beautiful first you have to understand the meaning of beauty, which starts from within. It is important to be a beautiful person first. Think good about others, if someone has been bad to you, forgive and forget. You must have done some bad karma so you got the bad attitude or doing in return.<br>  <br>  Be positive.

1ylpCN3yaa	You have to replace it with another habit so when you find yourself pulling out hair try tapping your fingers on a table or rub your chin but what ever you choose to do do it every time that you find your self pulling at hair or going to pull at hair. When you go to sleep at night think about how you are changing your habit and when you wake up in the morning think about it again and before you eat food think about it as well. The more you think about it the more you'll become conscious of doing it and so it will become easier to change to chin rubbing or what ever else you choose.|`|4sd4eeBdaa	Trictomania i think it is called, the only thing is to stop doing it, and concentrate by keeping yourself busy, or go to the doctors.|`|hJTvbbKnaa	Trichotillomania.<br>  to treat it go to Psychotherapy or get meds. medications work best when the person is also in therapy.

Its the Wet n Wild liquid eyeliner thats waterproof. My mom got it for me, because usually i go to Sephora or MAC for my makeup, but whatever, but still it works so well. I use it on my waterline and it stays on even after i sleep sometimes. :)<br>  Bad thing about it is that its really hard to get off without makup remover, so if you notice a mistake that you made when your looking in the mirror at school or something, you probably wont be able ot fix it, because it really doesnt budge.|`|8Initt1aaa	I have used MAC in black but I actually like Lancome's black eyeshadow better.

hnhb119Laa	First of all, they need for all models to be about the same, standard size, so they can have one size at all the shows and for all the manequins and such.  It woud just be too difficult otherwise.   If you have to pick one size to show your clothing, tall and thin would be the obvious choice.  <br>  <br>  It is about line and proportion.   Long, flowing lines are simply more attractive to the eye.  Long legs are almost universally considered more attractive than short legs.  <br>  <br>  If I showed you two pictures of girls, one tall and one short, who were equally pretty and had the same general build, and didn't tell you their height, the taller girl would almost always be chosen as more attractive.<br>  <br>  The proportions of a taller model are more attractive.  For example, the head of a short person and the head of a tall person are the same size.  On a short person your head looks bigger and out of proportion (I'm short, BTW).<br>  <br>  Simply put, any clothes that look good on a petite girl look better on a tall girl.|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	Because its all about the look, just like they have to be like anorexin they to have to be tall because tallness looks even more slender.|`|KkKCKu06aa	more beautiful, to me anyways.<br>  <br>  but it would depend what you're modeling and where. like a target catalouge, i doubt they care.<br>  <br>  but high end fashion, just a rule.|`|Vge3KBaMaa	i used to work as a make up artist for high fashion runways , thats just the game , its all about that tall long lean slender look , which is beautifull and elegant, designers use that look as their muses when they design thier clothes .|`|WlOhsDVZaa	designers want the clothes to just hang on the models..  it suppose to look statuesque.|`|lGF9GpI1aa	You have to be 5'8 to be a model.

2dya7YeKaa	Look here is the thing:<br>  <br>  It is possible to use numbing creams and stuff.  Most of them are prescription, though, so you'd have to find a doctor willing to supply you with it.  Even if you managed that there are problems with numbing creams.  It makes your skin react different to sensory stimulus so it makes it harder to work with.  While this might not make the tattoo turn out poorly necessarily, it will make the tattoo artists' job more difficult.<br>  <br>  With all of that in mind the other thing about numbing creams is that they don't always work consistently.  I have heard stories from people who used EMLA and had great experiences, no complaints.  I have talked to other people who used it and said "yeah, it was fine at first but it wore off halfway through the tattoo".  When you get tattooed your body naturally kicks in an endorphin response to help you cope with the pain.  If you use a numbing cream that doesn't happen and if the cream wears off your natural physiological reaction will be delayed.<br>  <br>  Better to go without it.  It is fine that you hate needles because getting tattooed does not feel like you are getting stuck with a needle.  It feels more like a hot cut than a needle stick.  <br>  <br>  As for how long it will take, you will have to consult the tattoo artist doing the work to find out.  Different tattoo artists work at different speeds.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WLuEIwp5aa	No, there's no way to numb it.  Numbing creams screw up your skin and can cause the ink to bleed and leave you with a nasty, blurred tattoo.  Prescription pain killers will just make you out of it and keep you from sitting still (not to mention it's illegal almost everywhere to tattoo anyone under the influence of anything), and a lot of OTC pain meds thin your blood.  All you can do is take a couple of advil to try to help the swelling, but it won't help with the pain.<br>  <br>  If you can't take the pain, don't get a tattoo.|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	Hun first off I don't think you should get that on you're body! Im all for the tattoo's and stuff I mean I am getting one myself in june but does that mean that much to you to get it tattoo'd on you're body? Please think about this! And I heard that It feels like a cat scratching you ha I am used to that I have 5 cats I guarantee it won't hurt that bad hun! I hated pain when I was around 12 but then I started getting piercings and I got addicted to the pain i love it now! haha<br>  Chelsei|`|kPMQt25Daa	if u go to a laser tat place they will give u numbing cream. just tell them y so they dont think ur sum crazy person who likes bein numb lol|`|WqVawp0Kaa	Definitley! Some tattoo shops have a numbing agent that they will use if you ask. However some may not so you'll have to find it yourself, it can be expensive (around $60). It's just a topical numbing cream that you put on the area you'll get inked aprox 5-10 mins before.|`|IS1F69mraa	There are numbing creams, however, it is highly recommended that you do not use them due to the fact that they can usually make the tattoo distorted.|`|wUIJSSJlaa	Im really not trying to be mean but pain is part of the tattoo.  I dont feel somebody has earned the right to have one if they didnt feel it.<br>  <br>  And, theres nothing that will completely numb you.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I have never heard of that but i guess you can go to a hop and ask.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Nope<br>  <br>  I mean "technically" it is possible they have numbing cream, but a tattoo artist won't tattoo you with that crap on your skin. They also won't tattoo you if you have taken pain killers [ loratab, oxy's..etc ] the prescription stuff. It thins out your blood to much.<br>  <br>  It really isn't that bad. It's usually well worth whatever pain in the end. <br>  <br>  Theres no way to know the price without a picture/drawing. <br>  <br>  I mean with what your saying..with the amount of detail you want it would need to be a good size tattoo. I say no *less* than $175...<br>  <br>  but more likely towards the $200[+] range. <br>  <br>  That is like a super super rough estimate. Pricing depends on <br>  <br>  Size<br>  Detail<br>  Shop you go to<br>  & shop minimum or what they charge per hour.

Good Luck!|`|6qljYOO2aa	Most likely, the guys you're trying to get now won't be there in 20 years.<br>  NEVER do anything that involves piercing/tattoos/surgeries just to impress a guy of the moment. I'm pretty sure its not worth it.<br>  <br>  If you feel good about yourself, and you show it, that's all that matters.<br>  <br>  The sexiest thing on anyone is confidence.<br>  Remember that.<br>  :]|`|0IKhaA43aa	pics private.<br>  <br>  but i guess it depends on the guy and how flirty and pretty you are.<br>  i know this one girl that has literally like half of one tooth and a hugggggggge gap. but you would not believe the bguys she gets.<br>  <br>  :)|`|wOl4yGSlaa	ur profile is set to private....<br>  if u want to fix ur teeth than fix them if u don't care than don't care what other people think, even though its prob not that big of a deal|`|FREPCRNgaa	You have your pictures set to private.

IIztioS3aa	a 20 volume should be fine. this is how i understand developer to work.<br>  <br>  10 volume - only deposits color<br>  20 volume - deposits color, but does lift (lighten)<br>  30 volume - mostly lifts but will deposit some color<br>  <br>  there is also 40 and i believe 50 volume, but 10, 20 and 30 are the most commonly used.<br>  <br>  never underestimate the power of red. a little bit goes a long way. and since your hair already has some red in it it should take better and stay longer. so pick a color with less red than your looking for. you can do a 10 vol but the color will be much darker than if you used the 20. <br>  <br>  as for going pink. i think that as long as the shade of auburn you pick has some darker undertones to it you'll be fine.

Ull find a taller guy dont worry.|`|BGNdKvXzaa	Please, stop asking questions that you already know the answer to.  Of course short fellows like me at 5'8", and taller fellows as well, are just as partial to tall women as we are to short / shorter women.  It is usually the women who refuse to date short / shorter guys, not the other way around.<br>  <br>  So be proud of what you are, and date whomever you feel like.  Short or tall, it is your choice.|`|7zrsIK9Paa	How old are you?<br>  Your probably under 15, right?<br>  Don't sweat it, most boys are short before that.<br>  I was 5'6 in grade 8. Then i turned 5'7 in grade 9.. all the guys were 5'8 or shorter.. Now i'm in grade 10, and when the boys came back from the summer, they pretty much grew reallly tall. Most of them are 5'9 or more. actually 5'9 is short for them. <br>  &Don't worry, it isn't wrong to date a shorter guy. Who cares what other people think? I had a boyfriend in grade 9 that was 5'6. An inch shorter. Now i can't find a shorter boy haha. My boyfriend right now is 5'11. He used to be 5'5 in grade 9. Big difference. <br>  And tall is sexy! You'll look great in skinny jeans. You'll also look great in a skirt so showoff those legs :)<br>  Trust me the boys lovee it. And don't slouch, it looks really bad. I used to do that and when i slouched i was like 5'7 to 5'5. Yea i slouched alot. But then when i looked in the mirror i looked really gay. Soo, just straighten your back.. when a guy says your too tall, their not worth your time.<br>  Just wait, they'll catch up to you.|`|oWTXPtxwaa	Well depends where you live, but you just gotta look for one.<br>  and it also depends on how you look, if you look freakishly tall,<br>  or the nice tall. you get me>?<br>  <br>  idk i would have to see you to tell you,<br>  i'm super blunt.|`|uiGx0rPVaa	no you could try out to be a model with that height :)|`|S3XT8UtYaa	Your height is perfect for you!  Stand tall, be proud.  Boys will grow up fast enough and besides, your height isn't what you are all about.  It's just a part of you, like your smile, laugh, brains or shoe size.  It doesn't define you.<br>  <br>  My girl asked me the same thing just the other night.  She's 15 and 5'10!  Her aunt is 6' and she married a man who is 5'11".  They have a great marriage.  (She even wears heels!)<br>  <br>  Lots of men like tall women.  Remember Pretty Woman?  Richard Gere and Julia Roberts?|`|NoMajXUCaa	no, because thats the height you have to be to be a model, and if you have to be that tall to be a model, obviously its a good feature.|`|knvXQDvzaa	Boys that won't date you because you're tall aren't worth it anyway. That's shallow of them to not like you because of your height. Love isn't about height sweetie!|`|UJHKyg7kaa	nnaaa!|`|53e825bd7214ff8635097f3a354c0738aa	It doesn't matter unless you think so.

2doWGNvOaa	Hers was custom made, as are most of her wacky outfits. She said in an interview that she made it by buying a plain half face mask (which you can get from fancy dress stores or from arts and crafts shops - if you can't find half, buy a full and cut to desired shape) She then smashed up a disco ball and stuck the broken pieces all over the mask like a messy mosaic. Just make sure the whole mask is covered. Maybe spray paint it silver (or buy in silver to begin with if possible) to avoid nasty white patches between shards - have fun! xx<br>  <br>  Oh also just found this that might interest you <br>  <a href="http://shop.ebay.co.uk/items/?_nkw=disco+ball+bra&_sacat=0&_fromfsb=&_trksid=m270.l1313&_odkw=disco+ball+mask&_osacat=0" rel="nofollow">http://shop.ebay.co.uk/items/?_nkw=disco...</a><br>  It's a copy of the disco ball style bra she has worn.|`|JMpFVt2Xaa	well it probably was a custom mask so i would suggest getting a mask that you can decorate like these--><a href="http://www.successcreations.com/Masks_For_Decorating.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.successcreations.com/Masks_Fo...</a><br>  <br>  then you could get mirror pieces like these--><a href="http://www.mosaicmercantile.com/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/scstore/mirroredtile.html?L+scstore+xjoh5311+1221278086&gclid=CI-J5timipkCFQIwxwodqDi56g" rel="nofollow">http://www.mosaicmercantile.com/cgi-bin/...</a>|`|AXCV7fNfaa	You can go to the craft store and buy some blank face masks and make one that resembles Lady GaGa's?

GOOD LUCK and have fun being creative!|`|BlPJw4iAaa	I don't know where you could find one, but Im sure they're not that hard to make. Just buy a plain mask from any art and craft shop, and the mirrored squares, and stick them on. That way you would defo be original and you wouldn't have to pay much for it! Bargain!|`|CNKBGVgQaa	I dont think you can buy one, but you could easily make one. Go to your local Michaels or PatCatans or any other craft store and buy a molded mask.

rEWVy1Sraa	You were right not to believe it. It's not true. The development of a girl's breasts during puberty is triggered by sex hormones, mainly estrogen. So you either have it or you don't or in some cases  breast size may also change if you  gain (or lose) weight for any other reason.  Hope this helps.|`|TKHHRUB4aa	If that would be the case, breasts implants will no longer be in fashion and there will be no agony for women suffering after post-operation due to breast augmentation.<br>  <br>  I would like for you to try it for yourself so that you will be living proof of the corn bread.|`|d548a740621c8e6ba2aae8985959861caa	I wish.

WAWVPyreaa	Just tell the stylist that you want your hair to look like Chase Crawford, and ask them to use a razor and make it choppy.

78ouhV4caa	I know how nice it is to have a good dress for the prom. I wanted a special dress but def didnt have the money to splash out on designer. I went to a local shop that sold prom dresses and got one in the sale for ￡100. It was originally in the ￡400 range. The reason it was in the sale is because it was from the previous season and had a tiny patch where beads were missing. I had the lace at the back repaired and replaced too. Left the missing beads- nobody noticed at all. I am about to try and sell the one i had...its still hanging in a plastic covering in my wardrobe! I will probs see if i can get ￡60-70 for it as apart from the few missing beads it is in good condition and a lovely dress. <br>  I will probs have to put it on ebay or something. Ebay is a good place to look for prom dresses- you can find some that have never been worn at reasonable prices or go to a shop that sells evening and prom dresses and look through the sale. You could pick up a designer one with the price knocked loads just cos it was from the previous season :)<br>  I hope you have a lovely prom|`|AA12297806	TK MAXX has lots of designer stuff, and especially dresses suitable for proms/evening wear all at v cheap prices... go and you'll be v surprised. there's such a huge variety of labels, some you won't recognise but there's those you'll definately will.|`|Vh3kfzajaa	ebay it. i got mine from there karen millan ￡28. bargain!!<br>  xxx

If it's screen printed on, then you should be fine to dye it  (but of course i'm not positive on this) if the lettering is fabric, then it would end up getting dyed too.  You could also take the jacket to a fabric store and ask somebody there, i know they would know for sure.  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|EeGlkABPaa	follow the instructions on the packet

I've used Mind Eraser and got a nice tan with it.   <br>  <br>  Do not use baby oil in a tanning bed.  Most, if not all, salon owners won't allow it.  <br>  <br>  After tanning, moisturize your skin.  You'll keep your tan longer.|`|68lLAQnKaa	baby oil, apply it about an hour before you get in the tanning bed, beware though because you will burn if you stay in the bed too long, start with a shorter time and then gradually increase... also tanning places frown upon the use of baby oil because of the film it leaves on the beds, that is why you don't tell them and you apply it early so it has time to soak into your skin =)|`|uI4Dspi4aa	I always buy my lotions on ebay. <br>  <br>  I personally like Pink Diamond by Sweedish Beauty.

Go to the salon to get the basic cut, bring in a picture. However you may end up wanting to add the layers yourself.<br>  And a lot of salons don't have unnatural hair dyes. You can find some on ebay or at hot topic if you want to dye it yourself, but the hair you dye the unnatural color you will want to bleach first if your hair is not a light color. OR instead of dying it, you could buy colored hair extension pieces, which is what a lot of scene kids do. Search etsy.com for pink hair extensions, or whatever color you want, and you will find some people that make hair extensions and sell them for about $10-15 for a highlet set.|`|Rpazygcuaa	I usually did mine, myself.<br>  But that was Ages ago.

dY6HroZ3aa	Instead of using baby oil, use a good moisturizer.  <br>  <br>  After you shave, immediately clean the legs thoroughly with cold water, pat dry and apply moisturizing lotion or cream. If your skin type is normal, then use a moisturizing lotion like Olay or  Johnson & Johnson; it your skin type is extremely dry then go for Curell deep moisturizer or Ponds cold cream.<br>  <br>  When applying the moisturizer, sligtly massage your legs with it.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	You should be mixing that with the stuff you use to shave your legs, not afterwards.<br>  <br>  Unless you get pimples on your legs, it's fine.|`|zanfEbhTaa	i dont think its bad...but id just use johnsons baby lotion..its soooooo good|`|FeWXOdhWaa	IDK bc.

FxkbbOj4aa	With your all-dark tones, try to bring some light colours in. Use nude eyeshadows and liquid eyeliner to really bring out your eyes, and more mascara rather than eyeliner.

hWc65sEtaa	The epidural actually goes in mid back.  I've had 3 of them.  As long as the tattoo is not in mid to low back, you can.  If the tattoo is like at your low back above your waist, then it won't mess with the epidural.|`|awskuSGBaa	That is a big no.|`|2dya7YeKaa	No, that is a myth.  That is like saying you cannot get blood drawn if the inside of your elbow is tattooed.  <br>  <br>  From the Mayo Clinic website:<br>  <br>  No, it isn't true. Most pregnant women who have lower back tattoos can receive epidurals. The exception would be if the tattoo covers a large area and is still "fresh" — meaning the involved skin is still healing. Actually, very few studies have looked at the risks of epidurals in women with lower back tattoos. But there is no conclusive evidence of any adverse effects, such an increased risk of an infection. <br>  <br>  Most anesthesiologists will give an epidural block to a pregnant woman with a lower back tattoo. However, they may try to avoid placing the needle through the tattoo to avoid a small scar that may disfigure the tattoo. If possible, the anesthesiologist will insert the needle through skin that isn't tattooed. <br>  <br>  If you have a lower back tattoo and have questions or concerns regarding your ability to get an epidural, consult your doctor.|`|ANsznbWsaa	In "what to expect" they say that a tattoo doesn't matter as long as it's healed.

DAABbc7saa	Well believe it or not, you don't actually have 2 use a curling iron.  But if you want the best results than you might want to buy a bigger iron like maybe 2 inches.  After a shower you just put some styling gel into your palm and srunch up your hair ( make sure your hair is wet). Then curl it when it is dry and it should look similar to the picture.  I hope this helps :))|`|Ue1QgNAUaa	you use your curler and make shure when you curl it u get a lot of hair because if u dont you'll get a puffy head of curls....LOL.|`|h8pTXfHqaa	try getting a bigger curling iron.|`|34K0QIzTaa	ok well...maybe your curing iron is too small...anyways you should make sure the temperature on ur curling iron is med. and then get soft curls.. then spray it with hairspray..<br>  <br>  also there is some shampoo and conditioner that help hold curls n' stuff :) hope i helped|`|sZMa0s7Baa	That wand you have is perfect for creating those curls, what you should do is first put a seasalt spray in to give it that texture, and then lightly wrap it around the wand. It should come out similar but will take practice to get it perfect!|`|irqM3hOZaa	well you could obviously use the curling iron, but that would take a while.<br>  a fast and easy way to get curls/waves is after you take a shower run some leave-in conditioner through your hair and then a bit of gel/mousse/whatever you like and the use a wide-tooth comb to evenly spread the gel. <br>  after that take little sections of your hair and twist them with your finger to form a spiral like curl until your whole head is like that.<br>  finish off with a hairspray if you want to keep it in place.<br>  and bam, you're done.<br>  if you know how to do it right, the end result looks awesome.<br>  good luck!|`|FZRZFusuaa	Dry your hair scrunching it with a diffuser and a sea salt spray (Bumble and Bumble has a great one)  or any other product that you feel works really well for you already.  Then go through with your curling iron and curl random pieces|`|dat8eoYyaa	kate's hair is more natural like that, but u could still do it w/ that curling iron if u dont to tight curls with the iron and some hair spray|`|zO0CFFvCaa	It doesn't look curly, it looks wavy. Try scrunching it with gel. It looks great. Good luck! =]
mP7q8eq9aa	Hello, My wife runs a beauty salon in London and according to her...<br>  If you shave your hair it MAY grow back thicker or just the same but it does grow slightly faster each time. Its best you wax it..this way it will become finer over time and will take longer to grow back and you will avoid ingrows.<br>  Shaving can also cause rash in sensitive areas and if you have thick hair then you will have to shave against the growth for a cleaner look...more rash.<br>  Lastly, most footballers actually remove their hair by laser. On average it will cost you approx ￡90 per session and you will need to go several times. If i were in your position i would opt for this as it is permenant however if you dont mind the pain of waxing.. wax away as it is still better then shaving. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|xxSGhywoaa	Why would you shave it?  You're a guy.|`|yo30g3pPaa	Im actually gonna give an answer unlike the others.<br>  <br>  yes, it will grow back, but us girls shave all the time haha, I wouldnt think you were "gay" or anything. And I know my friends would have no problem with it..but it might cause some probablems with your male friendss.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to do it, go ahead.

It hurts a little  but it well worth it for the results. Just stab the blackhead and wait for puss to come out. My dermatologist recommended this for me and it helped so much! I would say to do it right out of the shower or after washing your face using hot water. This makes it hurt a lot less and its easier that way. You should also use a blackhead scrub (neutragena, clean and clear ect.) 3-4 times a week to make sure you really don't get any b.h. at all. Hoipe this helps you!

KeDIU7pkaa	H-mm! Well, personally, that isn't a hard question. When your date chooses her dress, go out with her to help her chose. Then do the same with your clothes. Here is some of me knock-dead style combos for a MORP style party:<br>  <br>  1.) Yellow on plasma blue.<br>  <br>  2.) Red on Green.<br>  <br>  3.) Scarlet on Scarlet.<br>  <br>  4.) All Yellow, with pink dabs.<br>  <br>       MORP's are really funny and funny, so try and dress in really bright colors.

ixmaM395aa	Treat modeling like a hobby. It's a tough tough industry to crack. Firstly you obviously need to have the looks. And don't think just because you're skinny, tall and somewhat pretty that it's enough. Modeling agencies will pick at anything, a slight hang over of the pants, cellulite, being an inch too small, bad hair, bad skin, braces, a tattoo, a weird birthmark.... I mean EVERYTHING. <br>  <br>  So, if you're body is in top shape, you've got clear skin and you're at least 5'10" then you've ticked 3 of a million boxes. <br>  <br>  If this is something you're really passionate about, have the stamina to travel and be away from your family, can take well to rejection, lots of rejection, then you need to organize getting a portfolio made up. <br>  <br>  One normal photo, no make up & a plain t-shirt. One beauty shot. One swimwear shot. One lingerie shot. At least 3 high fashion shots. And you need to show versatility in all shots. <br>  <br>  So, good luck. It's not an easy industry, if you make it you'll reap the rewards but always as a model have a backup career. Let school be your primary focus and let modeling take the backseat for awhile.|`|ZFqz2DPRaa	Post in my picture saying it's you cause immmmmmmmmm damn hot ;), evidence:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=As3.iKEsD.Q6g0W30Rf3mkrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304143204AAbKl0d">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|hH4WUq5Naa	Well, if you don't look, you don't see, and what you don't see can be very hard to find!|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	honestly dont get ur hopes up. get an education.<br>  or try and compete in every single show and competition and answer to every ad (be careful thou, some of them are scams).<br>  xx|`|XkWTsyJdaa	if you want to sign w. an agency, big ones like IMG ford and elite. just go to the website and they all have online application forms where u just put in simple info and measurements. if they like u, theyll contact u. pretty simple. ford has open calls all the time if u just wanna stop by as long as ur older than 14. the only problem is..to get agencies to even look at u, u gotta be 5'7" if ur 14-15 and atleast 5'8" or maybe its 9 if ur older. u dont need to hav any professional portfolio or pictures to sign up|`|Pswqhimoaa	Get an education.<br>  it's so hard to make a lot of money in the modeling industry.

1df31c9db3dcca4d09a9e2c45066a64caa	Try Dickinson's witch hazel sold at most walgreen's for less than $5 and it's a good size plastic clear container it comes in. This lasts a long time. It supplies needed naturally made moisture to the face without any oily feel.<br>  <br>  It is good, it works and is fast to use. Just apply it daily with a cotton ball. It should help keep the skin clear naturally as well. I use it and it does a great job, it absorbs and no greasy feel ,no film on the skin too. My guess is your skin is not tolerating the ingredients in most moisturizers , this has none of those things that are in the other moisturizers. Try using it.|`|IHwMbLX5aa	I love clinique...

Cetaphil also carries an amazing facewash thats perfect for sensitive acne prone skin.|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	Ditch the expensive creams that clog pores and cause breakouts and go to the dollar store for a jar of petroleum jelly...trust me you won't find anything that moisturizes better and cost a buck. Put it on your face then put a warm moist washcloth over your face for 15 min. It also works great for wrinkles, to smooth them or prevent them. You don't have to worry about sensitive skin, I know I have it and swear by this method. It works great for feet and elbows too. Just smooth it on your feet at night add socks and have feet that are like a spa treatment. Have fun and God Bless, Velle T|`|jIvbG4Zcaa	try natural products that you can make at home.

2uZivThaaa	Listerine is good! Try using the Listerine that do not burn. Also use sea salt! Sea salt is amazing for new piercings. Just put some in a glass of warm water and rinse your mouth out with it every night before you brush. I have used this on many new piercings and they have healed in half the time they should have. You can find sea salt at any WalMart or Co-op.|`|ZIq2IzOmaa	Use an alcohol-free mouthwash or a saline rinse. <br>  <br>  Alcohol in a mouthwash is fine once you are healed, but while your piercing is new, the alcohol can burn the piercing itself and cause you to form excessive scar tissue. <br>  <br>  Washing your mouth out several times a day with alcohol mouthwash can also destroy the natural balance of bacteria in your mouth and put you at risk for an oral yeast infection. There are beneficial bacteria that live in your mouth and are not a danger to your piercing. These bacteria keep down the yeast that live in your mouth and that come in on foods you eat. When you kill the good bacteria, other organisms that you don't want can set up shop in your mouth. Using a more gentle mouthwash or saline rinse will keep your mouth clean without stripping it of friendly bacteria. <br>  <br>  If you have a normal immune system and are in good health, your tongue piercing is at a very low risk of infection if you rinse your mouth well with alcohol-free mouthwash or saline. You do not need to scald yourself just to be safe. <br>  <br>  I have personally healed piercings with alcohol mouthwash (before everyone knew it was bad) and I have healed others with the alcohol free washes and saline. The alcohol free piercings were much more comfortable and improved much more quickly over the first weeks.|`|pWl7SHjTaa	I have heard people say to use Biotene because it is alcohol free and doesn't burn and that alcohol is bad. But, I've also heard (from mroe than a few piercers, including my boyfriend) that Listerine or Scope is Ok, alcohol is fine, it just burns. So, I think if you want to avoid the burn, use alcohol free. If you are tough, use original scope (make sure its just the good old fashioned regular, because a lot of the special ones (whitening, w/e) will irritate the piercing). Just use it anytime you do anything involving your mouth (including smoking).|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	Alcohol free mouthwash. Make sure its alcohol free. Listerine is too strong and burn-y, and most have alcohol in them. If you have a particularly strong alcohol free mouthwash, water it down a bit.<br>  <br>  You could also use saline, sea salt soaks or that funny tasting h20cean. But they all taste disgusting. So I'd just go with the mouthwash.|`|Ks1uiHReaa	i have had my tounge pierced 3 times in my younger days...use listerine everything u eat, drink or smoke anything (besides water) and get urself a bottle of ugh i cant think of the name im pretty sure it starts with a "g" u can get it at any drug store is has a skinny top and wider bottle shape lol.|`|JbSebJJYaa	When my friend got hers pierced, they told her to use mouth wash a lot. Like after she ate, when she brushed her teeth, and if she smoked.|`|eBAji2tFaa	i just got my tongue pierced 2 days ago and what i was told to do is fill the cap of a listerine bottle half way with listerine and the other half with water. This will dilute the listerine so ur not killing off the cells in your tongue helping to heal it lol do this at least 3 times a day and after you eat, drink or smoke anything. And when you wake up and before you go to sleep...hope this helps!!!
AA11707096	Linen says summer.  That said, some sort of woven shoe or a sandal definitely in brown, no black with those pants and NO boots (wrong style for linen). Summer loafer, deck shoe.

Just remember this, please ... no linen before Easter or after Labor Day.|`|IHwMbLX5aa	I think it would look nice with a pair of dark brown leather flip flops or dark brown leather shoes.<br>  <br>  Maybe like these: <a href="http://www.bluefly.com/John-Varvatos-brown-leather-Perry-sandals/cat10024/301627801/detail.fly" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluefly.com/John-Varvatos-bro...</a><br>  <br>  Or these: <a href="http://www.bluefly.com/John-Varvatos-brown-leather-wingtip-loafers/cat10024/302550801/detail.fly" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluefly.com/John-Varvatos-bro...</a>|`|Oejricveaa	Maybe something like this...<br>  <a href="http://www2.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?DeptID=53006&CatID=53357&GrpTyp=PRD&ItemID=14780d4&attrtype=&attrvalue=&CMID=53006%7c53017%7c53348&Fltr=&Srt=&QL=F&IND=12&CmCatId=53006|53017|53348|53357" rel="nofollow">http://www2.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Dep...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www2.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?DeptID=53006&CatID=53357&GrpTyp=PRD&ItemID=1546797&attrtype=&attrvalue=&CMID=53006%7c53017%7c53348&Fltr=&Srt=&QL=F&IND=14&CmCatId=53006|53017|53348|53357" rel="nofollow">http://www2.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Dep...</a>|`|t0sjtkjAaa	<a href="http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10251_10201_480042_-1_12556_12551" rel="nofollow">http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/st...</a><br>  <br>  maybe these?!?!<br>  <br>  it would really help if you showed a picture of the pants|`|lj3e3rE4aa	These boots will work:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://img223.imageshack.us/img223/6929/0arobvandamcy5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img223.imageshack.us/img223/6929/...</a>|`|C4bB27wwaa	i thinks some of these style shoes would go great with them<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=364595&CategoryID=27600" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a>
5e7ae76d63cef0003f897d4f3907586daa	i use one of those nail buffers. or sometimes even paper can take small scratches off.|`|f2ZNJy48aa	You can get jewelry cleaner. That might work. You can also take it to a jewelry person and they might be able to clean it. That might be costly, but it's worth it. Jewelry cleaner is available at Claire's, JC Penny, Macy's, Kohl's BonTon, Drugstores, anyplace like that. Good luck!
9D6Y4dYuaa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  Sure you can. Any Walgreen's or CVS pharmacy sells makeup products. They usually have an entire isle dedicated to beauty products. And more often than not, they will carry eyebrow shadow. Because my brows are light, I have noticed the best way to apply any type of eyebrow filler is with a skinny brush. <br>  <br>  A pencil filler can sometimes be too harsh and leave the eyebrow looking patchy. Apply the color in gentle swipes in the direction of the hair growth. Then blend well with your finger. I know Maybelline actually has a product that comes with a small brush applicator that works really well. So, I hope this helped and good luck!<br>  <br>  Stay classy!|`|wzxmWDs4aa	Some places do, but if you can't just buy a normal (not sparkley) light brown eyeshadow and that will do just as well with a little bit of vaseline!|`|JhJXKRkOaa	No, don't think so.|`|yje6VNCpaa	some of the bigger ones sell it.<br>  if you cant find any, just use regular brown eyeshadow but make sure it's not too dark for your brows.|`|lYDQrqaeaa	I strongly strongly recommend Benefit's BrowZing this stuff is GREAT and it lasts 4ever I've had mine for about 3 years it is so worth the $30 - If you get the drugstore kind it will only flake this Benefit stuff has colored wax and the puwder to set.|`|iKYNUni0aa	yea you can|`|aPuefPuFaa	if they have a make up section than yeah.<br>  but i doubt they have eyebrow shadow.|`|8jY4JUw7aa	yes
