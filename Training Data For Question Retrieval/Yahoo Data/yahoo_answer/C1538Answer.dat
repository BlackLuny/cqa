They are taught to act like a good person so they dont go down to hell for eternity.|`|HrnlBc4Laa	Headbanger, the bible does not say 6000, what it says is from day one of Adam and Eve, counting the years lived by him and all that followed, we can estimate approximately 4000 years before the birth of Jesus.  from that date we know that was approximately 2000 years hence the 6000 figure.<br>  Now where did you get your 4.5 billion years.  The carbon 14 dating process has been proven wrong over and over.  Even testing know dated material, it will give a variation of many years, none reliable to pin point dates.  Then there is stratification.  A fossil found in one layer of earth, so everything in that stratus must be the same era or in the same age group.  Not so.  Evolutionist do not account for the massive volume and its devastating effect upon the earth, of Noah's flood.  The earth crust was crushed with weaknesses existed, bulging were weak spots were near strong point, and layers and layers of soil and debris redistributed.  Imagine the pressure of water which covered every mountain top by three feet of water, and this for almost a year.<br>  Then there is the idea that fossils take millions of years to form, yet just recently a T. Rex leg bone was found with the presence of red corpuscles, cannot have in your evolutionary world but in the real world it did.  remember, evolution is a theory, not a law.  More and more scientist are drifting away from Darwin idea, and looking more seriously at the creationist idea that just maybe the 6004 is more true than fiction.|`|db7eb7443a8c02c832e4204c401159e0aa	There's a diversity of opinion, even among Christians, over how old the earth is--thousands, millions, billions, trillions of years, or whatever.

Where does the Bible say that?<br>  <br>  Hint:  It doesn't.|`|aj5IBTuXaa	It is not the Bible that says the Earth is 6000 years old, but some Catholic priest who sat down and made some assumptions on the length of a generation.  Then he figured out how many years passed from Adam and Eve by tracking their kids.  Look through Numbers to see a lot of the generations.  Once you get to Pontius Pilate, he's in history books for which accurate age is know, so you add that age to the total of the generations and that is where 6000 came from.

Nothing finite can be infinite and nothing rubber can be steel and comparing apples and oranges is a typical creationist argument. 1, 2, and 3 are finite numbers, but you can have a collection of numbers that is infinite, you may also have  an infinite amount of groups of 3 or 6 or 11, so from where I sit, the argument is, and I'll be kind here, moot. There are religious scholars who claim that if you follow the descriptions in the bible regarding lifespans and amount of time passed, that they can place the age of the universe, not just earth, remember, according to the genesis story, it was all snapped into existence in 7 little old days, at around 6000 years. This indicates a belief so shaky that if this particular disagreement should go against the 6000 year idea, that it would devastate christianity. Wow, how strong must their convictions be?|`|256t9bIqaa	James Ussher says the our planet is 6000 years old.   Young Earth Creationists put their faith in James Ussher, a 17th century Anglican Bishop.    James Ussher calculated 6000 years as the age of earth by adding up the genealogies from Adam to Abraham and by assuming that the creation days of Ge 1 are 24 hours each.   It is Ussher's computations that made it into the footnotes of many Bibles up until the 20th century.   YECs put their faith in Ussher without knowing that that number came from him, and without knowing the two critcial errors that Ussher made in those calculations.<br>  <br>  Error 1:    The genealogies in the Bible have intended gaps.   A Hebrew literary tradition.    Leave out the unimportant people in your genealogy to keep your narrative interesting.   For example:   Jesus, Son of David.<br>  <br>  Error 2:   The creation days are not 24 hours.  Ge 1 is a thought rhyme poem, not a science paper.   The creation "day" is a literary device.   The first 3 days are time periods of formation.   The next 3 days are time periods of filling:   Day 1 gets filled on day 4.   2 filled on 5.  3 filled on 6.   Light->lights, sky and water-->birds and fish; dry ground-->land animals.    It's a thought rhyme.   The thoughts parallel each other.   As for then length of the day, they are indeterminable.   The 7th day itself has "lasted from the creation of the world until today."   Heb 4.  In the poem, the phrase "and there was evening and there was morning, the Nth day", is missing from day 7.   Therefore, according to the poem, the 7th day is still occurring.<br>  <br>  As for  science, scientists measure the age of the earth indirectly by measuring the age of the gas trapped inside volcanic rocks.    The measure the age of the gas by using postassium/argon isotopes:  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://id-archserve.ucsb.edu/anth3/courseware/Chronology/09_Potassium_Argon_Dating.html" rel="nofollow">http://id-archserve.ucsb.edu/anth3/cours...</a><br>  <br>  The age is about 4.5 billion years.   There are also 2 other radioisotope pairs science uses to measure the age of the earth.   The same result.   4.5 billion years.|`|RNyEQUQDaa	Lots of things around us give more than hints (like the moon) that the earth was most likely here 4 way more than 6000 yrs (exactly how long cant b proved). Does this disprove the Bible? Absolutely not! The crux of the problem 4 many is man (having limited knowledge) tries 2 know who God is by imposing human limitations 4 understanding things 2 God's abilities<br>  <br>  The Bible doesnt tell us how old the universe/earth actually is. Time as measured from earth wasnt set in motion until the 4th day of creation (not 2 b confused with the 7 days of Creation). So, God's length of a day 4 each period of creation could b anywhere from near zero 2 billions of yrs. If it was important 4 us 2 know the length of a day of creation God wouldve written it in the Bible. God's power is such that He could hv created the universe in whatever time period He so chose. But, the specific action taken was with regard 2 Gods purpose 4 everything.<br>  <br>  Many scientific finds r true but it doesnt mean "all" their claims r true (many dont take time & energy 2 carefully think thru things b4 coming out 4 or against it). Many dont properly take in2 account all it takes 2 create a universe/life (they tend 2 focus on things "seeming" 2 support what they want 2 &/or u 2 believe).<br>  <br>  In science we established laws of physics. We can't see actual laws of physics. Rather, we see the results & interpret & apply them in accordance with whats been observed 2 b true thru experiments/calculations. Same is true regarding God. Just b/c we can't see God doesn't mean He doesnt exist.<br>  <br>  There may b forensic evidence 4 some micro-adaptation & 4 some "appearance" of macro-evolution but most is inconclusive @ best & pure conjecture @ worst. Finding the beginning & reason 4 it all is unattainable by scientific method alone (a billions of years old cold case). We didnt see it take place.<br>  <br>  But things in creation show an Intelligent Being was involved or the universe & we wouldnt b here (ignoring where it came from). 4 instance:<br>  <br>  1. We have 2 lungs & 2 kidneys - each has a near perfect mirror-image companion organ. No matter how u try 2 explain it away, making a mirror-image organ takes full reverse engineering, knowledge & understanding of its companion's functions & purpose or it cant be created.<br>  <br>  2. Our bodies r highly symmetrical from 1 side 2 the other. Its impossible unless 1 has an outside overview position allowing full comprehension of the entire organism (i.e. feather color patterns).<br>  <br>  3. We have 2 arms & 2 legs. Each is perfectly designed & precisely engineered 2 work with its mirror-image companion. An outside position is required 2 fully comprehend the whole organism & purpose 4 all parts, 2 create it 2 such perfection.<br>  <br>  4. The "being" of a cell is confined 2 within the cell membrane & cant know or b aware of much beyond itself. A cell is magnitudes more intelligent than all humanity & has amazing powers 2 know all of an organism's functions & purpose or it isnt the "brain" behind creation 4 many millions of incredibly diverse species. If evolution had a chance of being the source of creation it would require there only be 2 or 3 "kinds" of different bodies with several related species (it would take many billions of trillions of light years longer than the universe has existed 2 have the slightest chance of producing many millions of species of such incredible diversity).<br>  <br>  5. Many cells of an organism never contact others much beyond its tiny cell. Mostly, cells & organisms r just copies of their parents doing about the same things as all ancestors. U wont find a bird whom builds a better nest than their parents & their chicks build even a better nest. U wont find a bear improving his living conditions (or passing them 2 his young). Either a cell has 2 lives - 1 copying their parents & 1 secret life working on improvements or someone of greater intelligence than all mankind created everything.<br>  <br>  6. Others point 2 DNA (or RNA in the 1rst organisms). But a cell needs DNA 2 function & DNA cant function without a cell. So, we have a which came 1rst a cell or DNA problem. Without 1rst having great intelligence, full knowledge & understanding of how an organism is constructed it cant be created. If an ape finds a combination lock he wouldnt know what it was & even if he turns the dial over & over again he wouldnt know what he was doing & the chances against getting it right is astronimical - especially if it had 150 or more no. 2 find in the right order & even if he got that far he still wouldnt know what a lock is 4.<br>  <br>  A cell has little "inteligence" & DNA is much more complex than a combination lock (especially in higher life forms) so the odds against figuring out & using DNA (in the correct sequence) is many magnitudes higher than 4 a lock). RNA/DNA r building blocks common to all life - having 98% of other species' DNA doesnt prove evolution. DNA like a computer code (but more complex) requires great intelligence 2 identify & assign its proper order - its useless unless u understand it. Give a book to an ape. Its useless to him as he cant learn from whats written - intelligence is required.<br>  <br>  7. In the fossil record we dont find millions of trial & error organisms that should exist if natural selection or fittest survivor is the source of creation (no organisms existed be4). The odds r so great against near perfection happenning 4 many millions of greatly diverse species, it couldnt take place unless 1 had full knowledge & understanding of what theyre doing BEFORE millions of organisms could be created 2 such precision. If not true millions of misfit organisms with mistakes, having only 1 or 3 eyes in odd places, 1 leg growing out of a head or where an arm should be or a fin where a leg should be should exist. Millions more misfit fossils should exist than of the perfection found in nature.<br>  <br>  8. U won't find species like a horse mating a goat, a frog mating fish, a rabbit mating an otter, a lizzard mating a bird, a cow mating a hog, etc. Species with similar genes/characteristics rarely mate in the wild. Only a few succeed @ bearing young. Its very rare that a wild crossbreed/hybrid reaches maturity or can bear over 1 litter (usually that litter cant produce or has complications that kills off the crossbreed). Only human intervention brings more success but even that has lead 2 some bad results.<br>  <br>  9. Evolution processes being "the" source of all creation would be like having a blind man build a car he's never heard of, seen, touched, heard or rode in. It cant be done without 1rst teaching him about the functions, necessary parts & how 2 put it all together so the car will function.<br>  <br>  10. Look @ the huge amount of intelligence, knowledge, understanding, time & energy used 2 create & improve an airplane's capabilities (& many mistakes). If people didnt fully learn what 2 do we'd still be earthbound.<br>  <br>  11. Creation is astronomically more complex than an airplane. The more complex an organism, the greater the amount of intelligence, knowledge & understanding needed 2 create it. It can only be done by an Intelligent Designer who already fully understands what He's doing - the sheer complexity of man is evidence of God (airplanes show we're created in God's image - God had 2 be the source of all creation or it couldnt exist let alone evolve).<br>  <br>  12. An incredibly Intelligent Being, capable of building a universe, would know the environment His earthly organisms are 2 occupy. So, He built in adaptability so His organisms could survive various earthly environments.<br>  <br>  13. Earth happens to be in the best possible orbit 2 support life. It has the right amount of gravity, the right axis & rotation speed, the right atmosphere (& ozone layer, Van Allen belt, magnetic field) & needed amount of water. The moon's the right size & in the right orbit 2 provide tidal cycles needed by organisms. Just 1 or 2 relatively small variants in our orbit/envirnment & most likely life would be very different & higher forms of life wouldve died off in a relatively short time, if they couldve survived.<br>  <br>  Problem is theres many religions, built on what man wants God 2 b like. I realized they cant all b right (Theres 1 Bible - why so many interpretations & fatal errors? II Pet 1:**19-21). Religion wont teach u much about God (they cant teach what they don't know) but God knows what He's doing. Who knows more about a house, the Builder or those who move in later?<br>  <br>  Many miss this: Jesus is the only 1 in history whom stated He's "the" way, "the" truth & "the" life & no 1 gets 2 God w/o Him (Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:12) & is the only 1 whom came from God. Its fully true or theres no truth & cant be any God (He knows what He's doing or He's not God). Either Jesus told the whole truth or He's a false prophet, among many, whom should b disregarded.<br>  <br>  Since Jesus is the only way 2 know God, "the" whole truth was complete & finished thru Jesus. So any claimed new or other religious beliefs or from self-proclaimed prophets & teachers r null & void & wont lead u 2 God. God always knew all Jesus was 2 do.<br>  <br>  Jesus couldnt hv done nor said whats written in the New Testament unless He fully knew the entire Old Testament (the NT didnt exist while Jesus was on earth). Jesus couldnt hv known the entire OT unless God was with Him. & the Apostles couldnt write the NT unless Jesus allowed them 2 remember & know what He was here 4 (Lk 24:25-27,45) - Not possible unless God caused it.<br>  <br>  Only 1 God can occupy infinity & that God is the Holy One of Israel. Infinity is the only place in which u can rightly claim u dont need a cause 4 ur existence. 1 big catch, its only fully provable b/c Jesus Christ is the real Son of God.<br>  <br>  voyc4rmwldrns|`|j1vjNjDiaa	No where in the Scriptures does it say how old the earth is.<br>  The record of man appears to be 6000 years, but one has to remember<br>  that The Ancient of Days has been there forever & who can say how<br>  old matter is & what form it took before it was earth etc.|`|c99jycZIaa	You should find a supporting Bible verse before making such an attack.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, it's called a "straw man" argument.|`|9tRZP9yaaa	It doesn't say how old the planet is.

gOzZ3lmLaa	I'll take a shot at translating this.<br>  <br>  "doushite kare no koto wo kangaeteta kanaa"<br>  どうして彼のことを考えてたかなあ<br>  <br>  どうして ("doushite") means "why". I think you can also use the word なぜ("naze") too. They mean basically the same thing, but maybe "doushite" is a little more casual sounding and implies that you're not really looking for a "hard factual answer" but instead are just "wondering" to yourself.<br>  <br>  彼 ("kare") can refer to "he"/"him"/"that guy" depending on the context it's being used in or particle it's used with. It can also mean boyfriend.<br>  彼のこと ("kare no koto") literally means "things about him". It just adds a little more emphasis to "kare" and sounds a little more natural to me than just plain "kare".<br>  <br>  考えてた ("kangaeteta") is just a very casual (spoken) past progessive form of the verb "kangaeru" ("to think (about)", "to wonder (about)", "to ponder (about)", etc.). "kangaeteta" means the same thing as 考えていた ("kangaeteita") and 考えていました ("kangaeteimashita"), but is much more casual and conversational sounding. Also, although you can use the construction について ("ni tsuite"), I don't think you really need it because the verb "kangaeru" kind of has an implied "about" attached to it's meaning. So, if you just use the object marker (particle) を ("wo" or "o") then it should be OK. <br>  <br>  Finally, かな is sort of a expression that can be attached to the end of sentence to add a little more feeling to it. Sort of like when you're talking to yourself, or asking a rhetorical question. かなあ ("kanaa") just extends the last sound a little bit and adds a little more emotion to the "kana".<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. I probably wrote more than was needed.|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	Kare ni tsuite kangaeta kana. <br>  彼について考えたかな<br>  <br>  You wre close tho.  Kana goes at the end, not the beginning. "About" is "ni tsuite" :)

But never have they put the money on the counter instead of my hand thats odd. Anyways she sounds a little delusional some of that stuff is just in her head. She's alittle crazy how is she going to have a black history month party but only hang around whites? Its best you kind of loose all ties with her. But yea she basically thinks the world is out to get her. She should know that anybody who wants to put a label on a race should not be given the time of day. I know if someone wants to see color instead of seeing who I am inside there really not much of a use to me. Maybe I'll be better off not knowing them and she should think like that too.

Either you misunderstood, or are making this up. I'm responding in any case<br>  <br>  1. "the world makes it impossible for them to get ahead." --- The world makes it very difficult for us, but we aren't going to let you stop us. History has proven this.<br>  <br>  2. "how impossible it is to be black in a dominated white world where whites rule." --- Yes, you dominate everything, but like I said, we are fighting back.<br>  <br>  3. "She said the reason why black dont own businesses is cuz the government or banks are predjuice and dont give loans out to them except only to foreginers, like indians and pakastianianis or arabs." ---What world does she live in. Blacks own businesses, but yes, it's hard for blacks to get loans even if they aren't a bad risk.<br>  <br>  4. "The government holds down the black race and doesnt want it to suceed." --- This is true. If you haven't learned this for 400 yrs, you never will.<br>  <br>  5. "She told me everytime she walks in a store they always follow her(employees) and ask if they can help her. Because she is black. They never put the change in her hand , they always place it on the counter cause she is black. She says whenever i am shopping with her they never bother her cuz im white. She says whites have it easy especially the males." -- This is true.<br>  <br>  6. " No one will give a black woman a chance in the biz world no matter how qualified she is." --- This is rediculous, and I don't believe she said this.|`|C9QQPROkaa	Of course it is just her i don't know what set or off maybe it was nothing maybe she's always felt that way i don't know but she does not speak for every black person please don't think that.

I would NEVER hang with her. I can't stand downers.<br>  <br>  And while some of what she says is true (being followed in a store...it happens a lot), she's stuck in victim mode. I have no sympathy for her. Black people can do just as well as Whites. Sure, we have to work incredibly hard, but don't go blaming White people for every problem in your life. <br>  <br>  It's just her. The majority of us don't think like her. We actually put on our big boy/girl pants and try to accomplish our goals rather than sulk at how unfair life is.|`|4hiMgHMCaa	Not all black people are like her and are obvious about it, but deep, deep, deep down inside, most blacks do think the same way about the situations she explained, and it's usually true. Not the part about all whites being racist, but the situations she explained like being followed in the store, and being looked down on secretly. Some blacks just don't let it bother them, including me. But white people don't usually notice these things because it doesn't affect them. Just watch the show Black/White by Ice cube. It handles all these situations through white people's eyes and black people's eyes. But your friend shouldn't be telling you to stay away, because that's not right. Just try to be more sensitive with her, or attempt to not talk about race, because you don't want to lose a friendship.<br>  <br>  The situations she explained i agree with, but saying that all whites are racist is a bit extreme. Just don't bring race up with her anymore, because she can't handle talking about it. Sorry if i got my words twisted up.|`|HimBbU6caa	Why are you friends with a racist? A better question is, If she believes that all whites are inherently racist why is she friends with you? Assuming you are white.|`|lPPgMKibaa	shes just racist. you were right.<br>  but if she hates whites, then why are you friends with her?|`|6ead7e745899491ccfd40dbc9c7d5ef6aa	Is it possible that you made a thoughtless joke or remark that set her off and without realizing it? Maybe she is venting because of an experience she had recently. I don't really know. To me, she kinda took it to extremes, blowing it out of porportion. But you have to understand that as much you, or me, or anybody else wants racism to be gone, its not. Blacks still recieve poor treatment because of the color of our skin. It may not be open and blatant acts of racism, but even the subtle forms, (like being followed in a store), or unintentional forms (like ragging on black history month) may upset some of us.<br>  <br>  Personally, I probably wouldnt go on a rant like she did, but if something you said or did offended me, i'd let you know it.|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	I will advise you- Stop making up ludicrous stories so you can say that Black people are really the ones that are racist and that Black women fly off the handle. Admit it this never happened. Your story is full of too many flaws to be even half way true, so rethink it make up another one and then come back.

bRLCxmP6aa	Elizabeth I had to deal with the domestic political and religious turmoil that resulted from the previous two reigns (her sister, the Catholic Queen Mary, and before Mary, her very Protestant brother King Edward VI). <br>  <br>  In addition, she had a number of foreign issues with which she had to deal:<br>  <br>  She had to contain French influence in Scotland (the Scots Queen, Mary Stuart, had a strong French bias - she had been married to King Francis II of France, and her mother, Mary of Guise, was French) while supporting the Protestant forces there. In addition, Elizabeth had to deal with the rebellion and political plots that swirled around Mary Queen of Scots after Mary had been deposed and had sought refuge in England. <br>  <br>  She provided military support to Dutch Protestants rebelling against King Philip of Spain (husband of Elizabeth's sister Queen Mary), hoping to counter the Catholic alliance of Philip with the French Catholic League (formed to keep Henry of Navarre, a Protestant, off the throne of France) that exposed England to the threat of invasion. When that policy failed to contain the Spanish Armada, she sent as many ships as she could gather against the Armada and mustered her troops to defend England in the event that the Armada landed. She then used the subsequent defeat of the Armada as a propaganda victory to bolster support of her reign.<br>  <br>  In Ireland, hoping to keep Spain from gaining a base of operations and to establish dominance over the largely Catholic population, she granted large amounts of land to her supporters and funded a number of military campaigns to suppress, sometimes brutally, any rebellions and uprising (Munster, for example, or Tyrone's Rebellion).|`|EsWdzJlYaa	1.She had to end the struggle between protestantism and catholicism in England.Being a protestant,Elizabeth obviously chose the protestant's side and secured England for protestantism.<br>  <br>  2.She was forced to kill her cousin because her cousin was conspiring against her.<br>  <br>  3.She was forced to stand up to Spain.This was a very hard thing to do in this time because Spain was tthe dominant European nation.Elizabeth used her intelligence to defeat the "Invincible Armada" or the "Spanish Armada".This was one of England's greatest victories.|`|vgHnnTxNaa	1.

I straight away rush to Asr Salat and again in first Saff, this time Sheikh Mahir as my Imam. And then go home and read hadith or islamic books. Then go to Magribh Salah and this time Sudais as Imam. After this Salat, I go home spend time with family. Also make my wife glow a smile on her face and my children - make them giggle (meaning be playful with them). After this go pray Salatul Isha. After Isha I eat with my wife and talk religious stuff and spend time with her. After spending time with her I tuck the children to bad but before that make my wife teach them Islam.

And yet I'm an atheist and under Islamic law in Iran, Saudi Arabia, and other places you consider morally superior to the West, I would have been executed for several capital crimes. I hope that puts things in perspective.<br>  <br>  Let's not forget that "Bible law" in the Old Testament calls for stoning to death prostitutes, executing blasphemers, burning to death whores. It's cruel, barbaric, and pathetic - just like Islamic law is today.<br>  <br>  Kencara - "blasphemy," "leaving Islam," and "sex outside of marriage" are victimless crimes not worthy of punishment or the death penalty as is done in hell holes with Islamic law. As for rape, few women can report it because Shariah requires 4 male witnesses to the rape - lest the female is charged with adultery. <br>  <br>  Protect freedom. Oppose barbarism.

Many, many years of research and testing have proven that, although some have talents which enhance their psychic ability, everyone has at least some degree of it in them.<br>  <br>  Have you ever met someone and just knew, deep in your gut, that they were bad news?  How about dreaming of something and then experiencing it?  Did you ever know something was wrong with a loved one without having any reconcilable input or stimulus to provoke the feeling?  Have you ever just liked someone without being sure why, and then later learned more about why?  Do you know identical twins almost always seem to feel each others' emotions from afar, and sometimes share thoughts when close?<br>  <br>  Anyone denying the reality of these things is sticking his or her head in the sand.  I am more talented psychically than most of the people I've known who have worked to develop their abilities, but I do know that it is not only a real human phenomena, but it is latent in all.<br>  <br>  In short, there are no FAKE psychics.  Many do fake their psychic ability, in their ignorance and lack of development, though.  Want to know how to tell?  Use your own ability to sense their intentions, and never but NEVER trust what they tell you when making major life decisions.  Use your own intuition (also a psychic ability, when you think about it), and think carefully about decisions before you make them.|`|H7gZZcwoaa	You can tell...well, except for the use of circumstantial evidence... simply because psychic abilities don't need to rely on often faulty and overused logic.

This really cheered Mother up; the woman, who was reduced to less than 80 pounds, began to smile as she listened to our stories about our childhoods and pets. And the next morning, she died with closure from hearing my brother's voice. For Mother life was not absurd, for Mother her four children gave her a purpose, and only the love that she freely shared with her husband, her children, and her Christian faith were needed for God to allow her to live until she reached her closure.<br>  <br>  Believing life is absurd is the product of a very weak mind.

You may never be completely comfortable around her, and she around you.  But you have owned up to past bad behavior and attempted to reconcile.  It's on her now.  Don't give her even the slightest reason to feel validated in her continued grudge-holding.|`|vAwzvNgzaa	You never will. you may say and think you don't but all people care what others think in some way shape or form.|`|d4516fe7123855fc5a87e84cc9791ef7aa	Most of the time when a person is concerned about another person judging them, it is THAT PERSON who is judging himself and projecting it on the other person.

VrTEMSsraa	Hi!<br>  i use Jaws too...<br>  Here's a tutorial about using Jaws.<br>  <a href="http://atto.buffalo.edu/registered/Tutorials/jaws/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://atto.buffalo.edu/registered/Tutor...</a><br>  Just email me if you want...<br>  Good luck!<br>  Bye Bye|`|rm5Nt2VEaa	I don't use JAWS but I use zoom text which is a similar program.  The best way to learn any screen reader is to learn the hot keys and what they are used for.  JAWS should come with a list of hot keys which are much easier to use than the mouse itself.  It can also usually be located in the toolbar of the program under the "help" drop down.  It takes a lot of practice but it's also a great thing!  If you don't get any answers specifically related to using JAWS I would suggest searching message boards elsewhere for tips and advice.  I found those to be very helpful in my new endeavors as a VI person.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3001gVA4aa	ahahahaha, jaws.... good times. Actually jaws and I do not get along very well. I had a teacher, I'm good with many things, teaching myself how to do things is not, however, one of my skills. On learning JAWS, just practice. I'm not sure if you have any vision or not. I cheat a lot and use my vision which is actually counter productive. Good luck on learning it :) I have no idea how to teach it to yourself. I had a hard time with it, the program is pretty complex, and the more you use a comp. the more compelx it is. I'm a college student so I need it to do a bunch of dumb things. and I have to say using JAWS on facebook is hell o_O <br>  <br>  However! Jaws is very useful, as you've found. I like it most of the time. I also love my braille display. Actually... I love my braille display more than the talking voice, but what-ever.<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! I'm sending as much luck as possible, four leaf clovers, hourshoes, the lot. :D

PsWzUuTtaa	Religion came out of modern homo sapiens. As soon as our brain evolved to the point at which we were able to contemplate our own origins, we went passed a threshold of previous hominids.

Appease the unruly poor by telling them that this life is worthless, and thier poverty and unfair treatment are small compared to the bliss that awaits them in heaven.<br>  <br>  It is a brilliantly engineered scheme that has been keeping the same groups in power for the last few thousand years.|`|Fyz94ApAaa	Humans were created for serving Anunna (the fifty gods).

I think religions grew as communities grew.<br>  <br>  I think most religions began as ways to explain natural events, both good and bad.  They kept small communities tightly-knit and gave them a common spiritual identity.  Because they explained both good and bad natural events, they evolved characters, which had to be magical, out of the ordinary, to explain tumultuous events as well as to entertain.<br>  <br>  I think evolution in religion occurred with evolution in lifestyle from hunter-gatherer to agrarian and city-bred.  Someone had a siritual epiphany and realized that all gods could be one Power.  Unfortunately, this wisdom could be too easily abused and could lead to intolerance, rather than an acceptance that all gods are equally valid; monotheism is just an evolution from polytheism.<br>  <br>  I'm rambling, but that's essentially how and why I think religions evolved and why we have them in the first place.|`|zTzMDsn4aa	People who wanted to wanted to know what happened after they died. <br>  <br>  They couldn't accept the idea that nothing happens, we're here on earth for no reason, and intelligent life exists for no reason.

God walked in the garden of Eden in the cool of the day. He talked with people, had a relationship with them, and demanded things of them for their own good. Some think this is much, but see how long you let your kids go (or any kids for that matter) with no demands on their behavior. As man rebelled more and more, God demanded more and more. Religion consists of this continuing journey to get back to God and the way we lived with Him in the garden. Included is a communication line (prayer), a guidebook (Bible), a Helper (the Spirit of God that has told you right from wrong since you could first reason), and a Way to get back to God (God's Son, Jesus Christ). I know this sounds narrow (and it is) but all religions aside of true and "pure" religion are counterfeits. I am more that happy to defend my faith without trashing your beliefs. Jesus is telling you to deny yourself what you want, and give Him what He wants: you. This is religion at its purest.

7hmGQTf1aa	Be honest with her.  Have a talk.  It sounds like you have a decent relationship and that she is a decent mom, all pot use aside.  I see her point though.  There are worse things to do, certainly.  As long as your life is good, you are a responsible and decent person and good member of your community, then who cares what you smoke (just keep it in perspective and don't abuse it)?  <br>  Just wait for the subject to come up again naturally and tell her.  No point in making a big production about it.  But she should know what you are doing, whether is is pot or anything else which could potentially be harmful.<br>  My mom didn't like it, but was Ok with me smoking as long as it wasn't causing a problem.  I think she handled it well.  We were very close. <br>  good luck and be careful!|`|PXUUmM7vaa	Be careful about mothers.  they can use you to make themselves feel better.  she needs to just teach you the right values, what ever they may be and then she needs to get out of your business.|`|xeR5lHaQaa	yeah that is pretty wrong...|`|AA12152549	Well, if you smoke weed and you want to tell your mother then go ahead since she's not against the use of this herbal substance.

wRpY2FRXaa	It is  actually "Baby Bondying" in  an old Filipino comedy film.  This "baby" (a male)  has been outrageously  spoiled by a  doting grandmother to the extent that he never matured (except in the age) into  an independent adult.  So being called "Baby Bondying" could refer to being a favorite of a parent, one who is innocent and naive, a childish person or an adult highly dependent on a parent or parents.

UxSsVIcEaa	Don't worry man, marijuana is a natural herb that is proven to be safe for recreational use. In response to what other people have said about marijuana being addictive, it isn't. It is the least addictive of illicit drugs, less than alchohal. People are hypocrites if they binge alcohol and claim weed is bad for you. <br>  It is a herb that can help you relax and take it easy after a hard days work, especially you being a student, you are experiencing stress, marijuana relieves stress.<br>  Once in a while is not a big deal at all. <br>  From my own experience, I go to UBC and smoke it about once every week or two. I am not addicted, I do it because with friends to have a good time and relax, I am not addicted to it, If I have work to do I can easily refrain from using it. <br>  look at social patterns, California may legalize it completely, in Canada it is legal for medical purposes and is basically legal on the streets as 70% of canadians over 14 have used it.<br>  <br>  dont worry man, once in a while is fine.

Period.  There is no chemical dependency.  Some might be psychologically addicted, the same as people get "addicted" to video games.  Definitely not life threatening.<br>  Weed is not a gateway drug any more than curiosity is. If you think that it helps people get other drugs...then you should legalize it and that will take away the crime networks!<br>  You probably won't get arrested.  There's only a few states that will actually take you to jail for having possession.  You can check your state's laws at NORML.COM|`|JAZntDd1aa	One bad this is that you could get addicted to it and lead you on to other drugs because it will no longer satisfy you.

StRaKUf6aa	I'm going to play the devil's advocate, just because there have been so many good answers already.<br>  <br>  My latest theory as to why black women feel so hurt when they see a black man (any black man) with a woman who isn't black could be one of many reasons:<br>  1. They feel inadequate.  Non-black women are commonly found as more attractive than black women.  Every time a black woman sees a black man with a white woman, she is reminded of the fact that she could never compete with said woman on a level of physical attractiveness.<br>  2. They feel betrayed.  Black women don't particularly like it when black men claim that they date outside of their race because black women are (insert multitude of tired stereotypes here).  Black women feel that they're stereotyped enough by people outside of the group and when it's by people of the group, it hurts even more.<br>  3. They feel unwanted.  Though the numbers are nowhere near as high as people would like to believe, the rumor is that black men find non-black women more desirable as partners than black women for stereotypical reasons.  Every time a black woman sees a black man with a non-black woman, she feels that no black man would want her.<br>  <br>  Note: I was generalizing for the purpose of the answer (before someone comes and says "I don't feel that way").  I don't feel that way either, I'm just trying to offer a different answer than the one I usually have.<br>  <br>  Very good question.|`|ncdTxID9aa	lol I agree<br>  <br>  <br>  I mean if you have to show disapproval to men of your race dating inter racially for the same reasons any one dates, then maybe you have some insecurities.  I understand people feel connections with certain people, but all black women don't connect with black men or at least the black men they see other races of women with.  This goes for other races but the topic is on blacks, lol.|`|82av0TbQaa	I notice this also, but I think a lot of black women wouldn't date the black men white women pick.  I know this because I am always pointing out good black men to my friend, who have good heads on their shoulders, and she tells me that isn't her type.  She picks black guys I would never give a chance to.  I mean yeah she picks good looking ones, but not good ones for a future boyfriend.  Then they usually get upset when they see a white girl with the ones they would have rejected in the first place.|`|6NEPcZFfaa	I could care less (i know thats cliche) but I have noticed that black men get just as mad to see a black woman with a white man. <br>  <br>  I could tell you what I've heard about why for both sides, but I don't want to get into all that- but it's NOT jealousy. I think thats just an answer someone gives when they don't know and don't want to think about it.|`|UhtSE2B6aa	I agree with you. I only date Black women, but I have no problem with people that date outside of their races. It is embarassing, they need to let those brothas be. Many times Black women hate on Black men that like White women, but 10 years ago, they probably wouldn't give him the time of the day.|`|HimBbU6caa	I've been trying to figure that out too, but it's true for some people of all races. I have dated Black women the majority of the time. I love them. I love all women. I was dating a Puerto Rican girl when I was in the military and my ex was Black. She gave me the whole "Black women aren't good enough for you" speech. I had to let her know that she was a selfish, insecure prude for once and for all. Of course she still believed what her insecure mind let her believe regardless. <br>  <br>  In the meantime I was enjoying myself with all types of role play and stuff. Fun stuff she wouldn't do.<br>  <br>  Edit: As usual Choc is on point.|`|UCQ2yr5Vaa	I can understand why black women would be upset.<br>  Especially if the black men were not your stereo type black dude.<br>  <br>  You know the type, loudmouth braggarts who like to smack black women around.<br>  <br>  Black women would like to marry within their race and wants to marry a nice guy, not some shuck n" jive guy.|`|e8lAALzgaa	Maybe it's jealousy or they just feel it's not enough good black men and when a black man dates outside his race that's one less black man for a black woman.<br>  <br>  But this can go both ways, I've seen many black men get angry when they see black women with non black men, especially when they see them with white men.|`|RFuWnx00aa	because they are jealous lol :D<br>  only thing i can think of...<br>  i know i hate that too..<br>  i also dont like it when people (my mom) judge black guys.. like, i dont think she'd ever let me date a black guy cause she thinks all black guys are bad.. <br>  oh well.. not everyone has a normal brain ^-^|`|pfke6Jieaa	jealousy my good friend. people sometimes get jealous when someone dates someone they cant have but wanted so badly. black girls talk mostly crap about the girl even if they dont like the guy. i dont get it too much.|`|C9QQPROkaa	Yeah there just jealous its retarded its like get over it already people are going to date whoever the heck they want.|`|uGT5d8Pdaa	i sense jealousy here. Any women can get jealous of the man she is attracted to goes with another woman.|`|EufLQ9dKaa	You're right when you say some black women because the majority do not care.  As far as the ones who do complain, I don't understand because it's usually a man they would not even be attracted to.  Take Tiger Woods for example, many black women complain about him and his wife but at the same time they aren't even interested in him.  Doesn't make sense to me.  Then you have the loser black guys with their pants down to their knees with a low class woman of another race.  Some black women get mad at that too knowing that if that man was to ask them out they'd be the first to say no.  Black women have to learn that this thing about black men selling out is not reality.  Majority black men are very loyal to black women.  The largest interracial relationship is white man/asian woman.  Another misconception is that all the nba players and black men in hollywood marry other races of women.  When the facts state that only about 2% of black men in the nba have non black counterparts.  Also more black women in hollywood are married to white men than black men married to non black women.|`|S4R82Xoqaa	I mean black men not all tend to put other women of different ethnicity on a petistol . However , when you see them majority of the time where I live dayton ohio; you will see them with oversized  or skinny , welfare  white , asian or  hispanic females. No offense but  I try not to get upset but when you tend to  put me down as a black woman and  use the excuse to date outside your race because of the stereotypes   you gave black women it kind of gets on my nerves .  It gets on my nerves because  herer you are with becky and her three kids thats not yours   and you  wifying her up . I mean love is love and I have nothing against interracial dating but when  you use the excuse to date   outside your race because you are brain washes by the stereotypes   thats when I have a problem .  Finally I have a problem when you over look  a black women who has her masters , or a higher education and go for   Mariah who is a waitress. I have saw the ugly and good of interracial dating . To many times I have sat around  some  of my black male  associates who date other women of color  and listen to them dog black women and  say stuff like " That why I don't do date black women  or black women are this and that. However their girl friend or wife is just out of shape un educated ,  have more one child , sleep with around with his friends and continue to keep her. Please thats when I get upset. But if  a black men truly love a women not because he wants his kids to be lighter or feel that he would make in America better with a women that is not  black ; I have no problem . I mean if a black man love a woman for who she is  regardless of race than more power to him . I just ran into many incidents where stereotypes and superfacial reasons is the reason black men date outside their race.   Thats why black women get upset , they do not want the men half the time he is not cute at all ; but its the fact that have someone on your arm that is not where better than her . I mean I seen black men pass up beautiful black women  at a club for some chubby asian , white , or  latina chick . Sorry its where I am from so  and beauty is in the eyes of beholder . I am not trying to offend anyone but  that mainly the couples look like , where I am from a thuggish or needy looking black dude with a skinny ,  or could miss a meal white, hispanic or asian chick.|`|85YtzzKraa	I guess it's jealousy! Or some feel as though they should stay within their own race! I think that the couple should do whatever makes them happy and ignore everyone else! <br>  Your friend or associate should not have done that because it's uncomfortable for everyone and it's inconsiderate of the two guys and their dates!  <br>  I think that everyone should be able to date who ever makes them happy and race shouldn't matter!|`|aHlpWFVhaa	Your friend made a fool out of herself, she doesn't<br>  even know those men!

So in short, I would say excess calories and not enough exercise.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I once lost about 100 lbs eating mainly raisin bran ceral (Total was the brand) with skim milk for about a year.

But even if you took that away from your diet, you still have to worry about MSG, Dextrose, hydrogenated fats, homoginized milk, meats with growth hormones, pesticides, nitrate cured foods, aspartame, saccharine, olestra and other chemicals. Yes lack of exercise but when ppl think of exercise they think picture a gym which doesnt have to be. Going for a walk, doing chores in your house, going up the stairs instead of taking the elevator, riding your bike instead of driving the car use up calories.

Yes a pre nuptial agreement is valid but it is not normal in muslim societies,because marriage should be in the intention as long as husband and wife life or for whole life.Marriage can not be predetermined for a certain period  and then get divorce,because mut'ah marriage is not allowed in Islam. But for the protection of a wife current assets,this pre marriage agreement of separation wealth can be done.In Islam the wealth of a wife including her dowry could not be used by her husband except without force her wife gave him part of her wealth.The cost of living in line with Islam should be born by the husband..During the marriage all subsistences are regarded as a given from Allah for husband and wife and also their children although only the husband who works for them.Allah gives subsistence through husband..Allah has regulated in the Qur'an how to distribute the wealth of a marriage when get divorce or died..|`|I5pUxwPbaa	Islam encourages contracts before marriage, especially for the protection of the woman.

In Islam, there are specific rules for all circumstances including divorce. Our contracts are also used to stipulate how much a woman gets in her dowry from her husband, which will be only hers (it can be money, jewelry, etc).|`|mwdwDOaWaa	As far i know, i think its valid.

6Zzh6EVXaa	i used to think that from as long as i can remember. i even pushed that concept on other people. until about 1yr ago i was shot by nazi soldiers in my dream and i was dead. i briefly went on to another dream b4 i woke up. i remember the whole thing as if it was yesterday. so no you don't die but i do think maybe a piece of me did die. good question!|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	No. I have had several dreams where I died.  I crashed a plane, got squished by logs falling off a logging truck, got stabbed with a sword, and so on.  You don't die, you just wake up.|`|JWjq5iaXaa	no, it's not, but if you got scared enough in a dream, and your mind just happened to believe it were reality, you could go into shock and possibly die.|`|AA11513482	This is based on the fact that if your that scared you may have a heart attack.  I'm not sure this is true, but I never hit the ground in a falling dream.|`|6kIw66Soaa	i think you watched the matrix before you asked this question,.. its a good one, specially if you want to write a fiction story.|`|0DfaG508aa	whether you dream of ur death or not..you anyways have to die<br>  <br>  and dreams are metophorical..never to be taken literally|`|FrLDHBLfaa	No.  I've dreamt my own death a couple of times.

People who are awake are usually aware that their life is ending, but when you are asleep you have no way of knowing. Maybe it's just God's way of easing you into accepting that you are dying (you were going to die regardless) and that way you didn't unknowingly slip off the face of the earth.|`|r0FFRRcAaa	idk i been having a dream of a men pulling me in to a lake of dark water i know the dream from begining to end its long so i wont say it i was about 10 then 2 weeks later i was drowing but thank goodness nothing happen but i didnt know how to swim back then so there nothing to worry now even if i still have that dream|`|V9d3qnUiaa	I don't think so, because I've had dreams where I've "died," and I woke up feeling strange, and odd..but obviously not dead.

ixFbNr4taa	Yes and No...<br>  <br>  The Red Hand is the symbol of the province of Ulster.  According to  ancient myth, Ulster had, at one time, no rightful heir. Because of this it was agreed that a boat race should take place (possibly in Strangford Lough) and that "whosoever's hand is the first to touch the shore of Ulster, so shall he be made the king".  One potential king so loved and desired Ulster that, upon seeing that he was losing the race, he cut off his hand and threw it to the shore — thus winning the kingship. The hand is most likely red to represent the fact that it would have been covered in blood.  COOL?, HUH?!!!<br>  <br>  Now - Ulster is a part of Northern Ireland (British ruled currently).  So for some -- it is a symbol for British Royalists and for others (Irish Nationals) it is a symbol of a future United Ireland. <br>  <br>  Here's a section about the "oddity" on Wiki.....<br>  <br>  The Red Hand is used in the Ulster Banner, the Ulster Flag and on the shields of counties Cavan, Tyrone, Londonderry, Antrim and Monaghan. It is also used by many other official and non-official organisations throughout the province of Ulster. Some Loyalist organisations in Northern Ireland prominently display the Red Hand in their insignia and paraphernalia.  But, GAA clubs that would normally be affiliated with the Nationalist/Republican community also use the Red Hand widely. It was also used by the Republican Irish Citizen Army on their uniform, the Irish Transport and General Workers Union (I.T.G.W.U) and the Irish Republican affiliated National Graves Association. It is also the badge of baronets other than those of Scotland or Nova Scotia. In the flags, the red hand is a right hand; for baronets and the Irish Society, it is a left hand.<br>  <br>  "The Red Hand of Ulster's a paradox quite, <br>  To Baronets 'tis said to belong; <br>  If they use the left hand, they're sure to be right, <br>  And to use the right hand would be wrong. <br>  For the Province, a different custom applies, <br>  And just the reverse is the rule; <br>  If you use the right hand you'll be right, safe and wise, <br>  If you use the left hand you're a fool.

And there were a great number of tax collectors and others who sat down with them.  30  And their scribes and the Pharisees complained against His disciples, saying, "Why do You eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"  31  Jesus answered and said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.  32  I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."<br>  <br>  Here you see Jesus associating with immoral unsaved people.<br>  <br>  Matthew 18:15  "Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother.  16  But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that 'BY THE MOUTH OF TWO OR THREE WITNESSES EVERY WORD MAY BE ESTABLISHED.'  17  And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector.<br>  <br>  Here you see Jesus saying that if a "brother" refuses to repent of sin then consider him to be an outsider. <br>  <br>  I don't see a contradiction, do you?|`|DDFgKxcaaa	Yes. These verses don't jive with the parable of the pharisee and the tax collector and many other Jesus teachings.

When Yeshua preached to sinners, they were OUTSIDE the belief system of Judaism due to their sin and unbelief.  Similarly, we are all called to preach the Gospel to the world so sinners can be saved.  Paul preached to unbelievers all the time and reiterated the command that we should do it, too.<br>  <br>  But in the passage you've quoted, Paul is speaking of sinners INSIDE the church, who state they're believers but are engaging in unrepentent sin.  Paul rightfully commands that such people be removed from the church.|`|AA11115051	Jesus  said if your arm causes you to sin get rid of it because it is better to enter heaven armless then to be fully thrown into the lake of fire.

GOD wants happy families but if all they do is trip on your way to becoming a faithful servant what use are they?|`|SbN2cXE5aa	No.  Paul does not say not to go and preach to the sick.  He is talking about becoming like the world.  Jesus never became like the world, He elevated those people and brought them to follow Him.  <br>  Same message.|`|AA12045802	Yes it does.|`|ARUinuP7aa	No|`|1cc22a420cd1103618bcd0912740454faa	No ... when you read what Jesus said and did - you can see that Paul was in-line with Jesus.  Jesus was establishing His Church whereas, Paul was dealing more directly within the church [church administration] Jesus had already established, as an administrator.  Christians are to be a light to the world and being a "light" means associating with those outside the church - not doing as they do [wrong] but not condemning them nor coming across self-righteous to them.  As a Christian, we are called to be different and to show love to all others.  We are to reach out - be seen and not heard (unless asked).  The word "judge" can mean to "discern" or to "condemn".  Christian are to "discern" attitudes - not going about condemning.  Christ tells us to "condemn" [judge] not" and Paul was telling us to discern within the church THAT ATTITUDE  of one, who calls them self a Christian and is not trying to "walk the walk" but is "talking the talk", only !  Paul is saying, should this be the case, to have that person placed out of the church and back into society to live the life he or she is living wrong the way before the wrong attitude permeates through the church [congregation] and has a  negative effect.|`|Ja7v7ZVBaa	Not really. Jesus said that if one of your hands causes you to sin, cut it off. If one of your eyes causes you to sin, pluck it out. You could interpret that to say the same thing that Paul's saying here. Because you have to live in the world, you'll never be able to remove yourself completely from sinners, but you can "cut out" people who will cause you sin from your own in-group, the church, which is the body of Christ. <br>  <br>  Paul says what Jesus says in that he tells people not to judge non-Christians, but Paul takes it a step further by saying that it's perfectly ok (and even necessary) to judge among fellow Christians.|`|RyhluHk3aa	Jesus Christ preached the Gospel of the Kingdom (Matt. 4:23,9:35, 24:14; Mark 1:14), which was the Gospel for Israel, under the Law.<br>  Christ came in the flesh for ISRAEL only (Matt. 15:24), and His message was to Israel ONLY.<br>  <br>  The apostle Paul, on the other hand, preached the Gospel of the Grace of God, given to him by DIRECT REVELATION from the risen Christ (Galatians 1:11,12), which was for the Body of Christ, made up of both Jews and Gentiles.<br>  <br>  A different gospel? Yes, it was. VERY different. Once God judged Israel for unbelief in His only begotten Son, and set them aside "for a time", God concluded ALL in sin, and unbelief, thus bringing Israel down to the level of the Gentiles. Then, the risen Jesus Christ blinded Saul of Tarsus, and spoke to him. Those with him heard the voice, but saw no man, and were afraid.<br>  Paul was the first man saved under God's grace, and the risen Christ raised up Paul to be THE apostle to the Gentiles, and by direct revelation, gave to Paul the Gospel of the Grace of God.<br>  <br>  This is all chronicled in the book of Acts, and the epistles of Paul. All one needs to do is read it.

XN0cYCATaa	Is sex before marriage okay if you love each other?<br>  No, sex before marriage is sinful even if you love each other.  Being in love doesn't alter the reality that the sexual act is outside of marriage, marriage being the ceremonial union of a man and woman in matrimony.  Sex outside of marriage is called fornication and the Bible definitely condemns it.<br>  <br>  Matt. 15:19-20, "For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders. 20 These are the things which defile the man." <br>  Acts 15:29, "...that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well." <br>  1 Cor. 6:9-10, "Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10 nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God." <br>  Heb. 13:4, "Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers God will judge." <br>  So, very clearly fornication is condemned in scripture and there is no provision for it being acceptable just because someone loves each other.  Besides if this couple is so much in love, then why don't they carry out what true love is and marry each other?  True love is when you put another person first, not when you take from them.  For a man and woman to engage in fornication is to declare that such love for the other person is more self centered, than other centered.|`|xo4iux9gaa	Get married!  Don't you think Its about TIME !|`|ehBPus3Zaa	According to the Bible, yes, because it is still outside of marriage. <br>  Alot of people compromise convictions about this because so many other couples are doing it.

The ideas of a license from the government or a ceremony with recited vows are man-made. If you and she are committed to each other, then in God's eyes, you are already married. The license will get you government benefits, and a church wedding will stop other Christians from looking down their noses at you.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	No it is not a sin. In the book of Jebedelilah verses 3:10-3:13 it says, "Sleeping with a girl you have been with for ten years and you haven't quite technically married but you have been together for eight years then sex is not a sin." Only if you have known the girl for a few dates but don't really like her is it a sin. But if you have known her for ten years then it is okay and God is cool with it.|`|1bd7361886f753dc29575d47b7fb14d0aa	The bible, God's word calls it fornication, you decide. If you are not a Christian then it is understandable and I'm pleased you are going to marry the girl, that in itself is honoring God. What really counts is what you do with God's gift His Son.|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	Yes dude it is still a sin. There are couples who have been married for 40+ years that get divorced how do you know after sex that God forbid something might happen and the person can just walk away, because there is no commitment.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Wouldn't you be common-law married by now?  I think you're fine.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	No.  But seriously...ten years???  I can't believe she hasn't left your *** yet.|`|IkeCzc4Yaa	Regardless how long you been with a woman, or how much you love her, it is still a sin because God wants Man and Woman to have intercourse in marriage. <br>  <br>  I recommend you to stop this sin or greatly reduce it, and have intercourse when you both agree to when you are married. When you are married sex is no longer a sin if you do it with the person you are married to.<br>  <br>  P.S. Not sure about American weddings, in Canada when one gets married they are married in the name of God and the part of Canada they live in.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	yes and yes<br>  <br>  sex outside of marriage is a sin<br>  <br>  god said a man and a women should leave father and mother and unite and become one flesh.<br>  <br>  It is to be in marriage not living together<br>  <br>  fornication is sex<br>  1Co 7:2  Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.|`|7c69e40c6f0de4ca313a93133cad8bb2aa	yes, you are sorry. Maybe it wouldnt have been sinning if you didnt do things backwards. Like having sex then living together. You should have got married first. But i think there could have been an exception. Like if you didnt want the government involved in your marriage. Meaning you didnt want to get a marriage liscence. If you had proposed first and gave her a ring or something similar then you two declared yourselves married. I hope i was able to help and didnt sound rude or judgemental. Congrats and good luck.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Yes it is a sin to have sex before marriage remember that you are not married. No excuses for covering up your sin. This is why in olden days young girls and boys were given in marriage so that they would not commit sin at the age of about 16 they were married, it was permitted then .|`|EHozsofQaa	I know the YA! Christians will definitely say that's a sin, but I'm atheist and I think that this is totally fine since you are in a very stable relationship. That's not the same as if you were going out with a new partner every week! Congrats for the proposition to get married, by the way!|`|PbLuxnzdaa	In the bible yes its a sin.<br>  This is where i disagree with the bible, actually i disagree with a lot of it.<br>  and i concider myself a believe in god.<br>  ANYWAYS, yeah its seen as a sin, but i think theres nothing wrong with it.|`|H0Xtd7vHaa	A lot of people just live together now. Nothing wrong with that, and it's your business and nobody else's.<br>  <br>  It's only when religion is involved it becomes a problem. Lets face it every things a "sin" if you let that get involved.|`|AA11115051	If you mean legally in human laws don't worry. But if you mean in GOD's  commandments I'll tell you this. I will not condemn you with knowledge of scripture. But the scripture should be obeyed whether you do it or not is something between GOD and you!|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	It's called fornication if you are not married.Repent and get right with God, and He will bless your marriage.Sin is sin for everyone|`|9p6IyvgKaa	shes been with you for 10 years.<br>  God has been with you forever.<br>  <br>  make you choice.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	You're already married.

You're still fornicating...doesn't matter how long you have been doing it..it's still sin.  Marriage is not just a state endorsed sig...it's a covenant entered into by man and woman before the eyes of God, family, friends, and the community.  A public declaration of vows to uphold certain degrees of behavior.  Some ministers will not perform the marriage if you are..you know.  They will insist on premarital counseling (this I strongly recommend.) and that you live from now till the wedding date in a chaste and celibate manner. (this I also strongly recommend)  Living a chaste and celibate life together can be an extremely refreshing and learning experience.  It helps you to find other ways of being intimate, and reinforces the fact that intimacy is only partially about the body.  It helps to refocus your mind to the complexities and beautiful aspect of the other persons personalities, as well as letting you be more receptive to seeing their flaws.  Yes, it's difficult..(I've gone through it....so I know...) but ask God for the gift of chastity, and think of the chastity that you will give your future spouse as a gift for them...that you would both lovingly and knowingly enter into a chaste and celibate relationship for the benefit of the marriage, in seeking to make it as strong as possible, is a wondrous gift to give.|`|b62aa03435c366476a024d6636bd1414aa	Yes, the bible says it will judge fornicators and adulterers.  So when people make up their own rules and say "well I know what the bible says and I go to church so if I sin it is okay with God."<br>  <br>  But the bible clearly shows it is not okay with God.  The church you are going to must be more concerned about your contributions than teaching  you the truth.  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:9?What! Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, 10?nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom. 11?And yet that is what some of YOU were. But YOU have been washed clean, but YOU have been sanctified, but YOU have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the spirit of our God.
AA10381258	I'm afraid I don't have a good suggestion for how to politely ask this. I, unfortunately, kept the problem to myself for much too long, and sleep deprived and cranky, threw a tennis ball at my ceiling as hard as I could. That was terribly rude of me, but it did get the message across. Very clearly. She moved out within a month, and we got really lucky that a very quiet older fellow moved in. Though my situation worked out nicely, I'm simply suggesting that you not wait too long before a polite word or two, because the longer you harbor the annoyance, the harder it is to remain polite.|`|7hmGQTf1aa	It depends on whether you already know this neighbor or not.  I would simply go talk to him, explain that you are having trouble sleeping and how much the noise carries through your ceiling (he may not even be aware of that) and ask if after a certain hour (say 10 or 11pm) he  would make an effort to keep it down a little.  Just be nice, and try not to be too confrontational about it.  See how that works.<br>  You can offer to get him some throw rugs too, if you think that would help... my mom did this with an upstairs neighbor when I grew up in NYC, and I think it got the message across pretty well.  They quieted down, or at least took their shoes off (there were wood floors there).<br>  Good luck!|`|ivejg4whaa	Do you have a landlord you can mention this to? If you don't, I would leave a note on his door and politely ask him to be a little more quiet so you can sleep at night.<br>  Good luck. Having neighbors at such close quarters suck. One apartment complex I lived in, I could actually hear our downstairs neighbor SNORING!!!|`|SnpP6dGFaa	maybe if you see him in passing mention that he is a little noisy at night and you have work etc...and if he could just try to be a little quieter .

4args6jHaa	The issue between some catholics and some protestants goes a long way back.  Back to the beginnings of the reformation.The catholic church at that time had some priests ( I can't say many because there are no set numbers...) in it who abused their ordinations.  Unfortunately, this was true of bishops too.  Some priests sold indulgences and some bishops sold indulgences, absolutions, as well as clerical positions in the church.  Several also had mistresses, and kept whole households, including their children.  These children would later either enter the priesthood (after being declared legitimate) or because of family connections, enter into lucrative careers or social ranks. The average person saw what was happening, and they knew that it was wrong.  Some like Martin Luther, tried to call the church's attention to the illness within it's ranks.  Unfortunately, the church was prideful.  So instead of forcing a true reformation of itself, it launched what was called the counter reformation.  When the Roman Catholic church saw that more and more people were joining what they had orginally considered a small group of disgruntled worshippers in ever larger numbers, they began to panic and decided to put an end to things as quickly as possible.  This included the use of the Inquisition.  (And yes, this office still exists in the Roman Catholic church...it just has a much less daunting name.  The current pope was a  member of this office in the past. )  Groups of protestants (protestants means basically those who protest...) decided to come to America to try to get away from the persecution they were facing in European nations.  They came here and established colonies which would eventually break away from Europe and become the United States.  When they broke from Europe, some believed that it was also necessary to break from Rome...completely.  Kings ruled by divine right, and the pope could declare a King and his nation under interdict..which basically means he could stop them from receiving the sacraments.  The pope could basically strip the Kings of their "divine right".  In breaking away from Rome for religious purposes, they also broke from Rome to ensure that no outside nation had any influence over the politics of our young nation.  Generations went by and catholicism remained a minority religion with large increases in attendance and membership occuring after large scale immigration from traditionally Catholic countries.  The Roman Catholic church would help these new immigrants, and the Church became the center of these immigrant communities.  To ousiders, the immigrants were strange people who isolated themselves, had a different language, odd habits, and questionable morals.  After all, look at the large numbers of children they produced.  This occured when the practice of restraint, even in marriage, was the socially acceptable norm, and middle class and upper class husbands and wives had very set rules about married behavior.  Seperate twin beds were not uncommon.  Since these new immigrants were largely catholics, the feelings of distrust felt towards these strangers with odd diets, lack of restraint, strange customs, and ridiculous languages spilled over to the catholic chuch which was active in these communities. It was a matter of serious, middle class,  and proper protestantism looking down on the vulgar, riotous, poor, and licencious catholics.|`|PNsol7DKaa	I guess you are either writing this from the US or UK where catholics are the minority.

I don't hate them and nor would I hate Catholicism per se. This question is sorta off.|`|DKrmoG4Haa	Whether one is a 'catholic' or belonging to any 'religious sect' is it genuine to hate one's co-being. Hate breads hate and the Lord says Love breads Love.The kings of the ages in which Jesus was living in His physical body, the priests of those days hated Him, despised Him, convicted Him, abused Him and what not! What a human is not expexted to do to another co-human was done to Him. Yet the greatness..no..no..the nobility lies in that divine Soul. Jesus never hated -as the Holy Bible attests- any body irrespective of any uncompromising schools of thought that prevailed in those days denouncing vehemently His preachings studded with noble Human values! His compassion for His follower or for His foe, the distractor were equally the same. Never He dispised His enemy. I understand He preached and lived in highest philisophy of Advaita (non-dualism) in which one sees him-self in the other(even the other is His strong  opponent) irrespective of millions of contradictions He has with him! God has given us this beautiful planet with an excellent infrastructure to live within harmoneously.We are all the same organs of that one magnificent universal Source that is GOD- a Generator, an Organizer and a Destroyer.When we belong to the same Entity where is the question of hating each other.<br>  <br>       Dear friend, you are pretty aware of this example- if the  hand is afflicted with cancerous deadly disease do you see the other hand hates it and detaches it-self from the body or take a drastic decision to ampute it at that instant and execute the decision? No.. When a thorn pricks your foot severely the pain is unbearable, your hand immediately responds  to the debacle and plucks it out and make the leg happy free from that deadly pain. Eyes get watered with sympathy showing the way to the hand to pluck the thorn off the foot. Mouth instantaneously screams as if it it-self is hurted! Kindly note the harmoneous living of all the organs of our body trying their best to make us happy and comfortable. <br>  <br>  Let us not be ego-centric and conceited about the acquired and all imported knowledge to hate the other. The end of education is character and the end of knowledge is Love.. just Love only. Animals or species of the same kind do not hate each other but the Humans do? The God has given a wonderful instrument or a 'tool'the Mind and Heart to mend ones  life divine-like. The human is endowed with discretory and rational powers through these devices called mind and heart.<br>  <br>  Let us with gratitude towards the Lord use these two devices (mind and heart) appropriately and legitamately to acquire the fundamental Five humanvalues' The Truth', 'Righteousness', 'Peace', 'Love' and 'Non-violenece'. Once we acquire them 'the desire, the anger, avariciouness,  lust, jealousy and envy'  would certainly vanish and dissolve.  In the place of Ego, the Humility and Love sprout! And now whom to hate?

AyEkA6Flaa	If he already knew how to do everything right, I'd say he has been thinking about this for a while.  And that he was so open to sweetly kissing you implies great love on his part.<br>  <br>  Now that you've pestered him to examine his sexualtiy, and have opened the door, *don't* stop now.  That would be like slamming the door in his face -- very rude, wouldn't you say?<br>  <br>  If he wants to keep doing it, keep it up as long as he wants.  You both seem to be into it.<br>  <br>  Hmm, you know, many bi or gay guys grow up in denial even to themselves that they find guys attractive.  We live in a very hetero culture, and many guys can't bring themselves to imagine another possibility.  I'd say he had this within him, but you did awaken it.<br>  <br>  Now that you've awakened Prince Charming with a kiss, it only seems right to keep on kissing him.<br>  <br>  But if at some point *he* decides, or you *mutually* honestly decide you don't want to be romantic anymore, that's cool too.  Then just hug each other and go back to being best friends.  But for now -- *promise* each other and *agree* that you will remain best friends always, no matter what!<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, make love with that nice boy!  Make him feel awesome every time.<br>  <br>  One more thought:  I hope you really love him and aren't just sleeping with him for kicks, only to eventually tire of him and dump him in six months...?  He trusts you and seems to love you.  Live up to that trust and love him back.  Treat him well...and enjoy him.|`|nga1mAaVaa	well u shud talk 2 him and c wat he thinks<br>  if he feels unconfertable take it a little slower|`|9545a4ddb6073ec8eff382149371b038aa	I wouldn't feel bad. I don't believe you can "turn" someone straight or gay. It's more than likely your friend is gay or bi and just hadn't come to turns with it until you made him comfortable. <br>  <br>  If he is willing and interested in a relationship with you I think you should keep it up.|`|lb6jBcDiaa	if he wants to then its all good<br>  if he doesnt, then dont push it<br>  <br>  tell him your willing to wait and that you dont want to do anything to make him uncomfortable<br>  <br>  think about it this way, he could be your best friend forever or just another guy?<br>  <br>  talk to him about it, set up some ground rules like if anything happens, the friendship will always come first<br>  <br>  good luck! :D|`|I2wPn0Zlaa	My straight friend told me she liked me. Im straight as well. At the time we both had boyfriends. Basically one thing lead to another one night and after months of being best friends and flirting, we finally decided to "hook up" one night.

Go for it. Who knows you better than your best friend. There is no need to feel bad. He would not have done anything he did not want to do and if he wants to continue then you definitely have done something right. Enjoy it and don't over think what is happening. Love comes when u least expect it sometimes.|`|d0fLx0LPaa	If you feel that way about him you shouldn't leave it alone.

Good luckk Mann(:|`|5Xmbd6RVaa	I'd say congrats. Make sure that you are honest and open with him. If your friendship is more important to you than your sex life let him know.

When I first had sex it was with my best friend. And I was not happy to find out that I liked gay sex as much as I did -- even though I had always known I was more attracted to guys. <br>  <br>  I rejected my friend and then kept having sex with him, then kept rejecting him. Finally, he dumped me because I wasn't ready to be out. I don't know the magic answer, but maybe my story above will be good for you to know about. I'm not sure if my friend should have insisted on being just friends - but truly being a real friend still - for a while or what. It's tricky because it's not like the whole process wasn't new for him too...(He had only done it w/ girls b4...but I was more repressed about the whole thing.)|`|Dwea01UWaa	Dang ! I'm actually a bit apalled at this situation. I'm new to Yahoo Answers and never heard anything like it before. Well, anyways, when it all comes down to it, people can choose between right and wrong. When someone does something, they choose to do it. So, you may have pressured your friend, but you didn't threaten or hurt him. (I hope) That way, he could've easily chosen not to do it, but he did. So if he wants to keep doing it, then let him. In the end if you guys ever get in trouble or something goes down, you'll both pay. He'll have to pay to even if it was wrong on your part to pressure him and he was a victim, because he chose to do it. I personally don't agree with that type of lifestyle at all, but if that's what you guys want, then go ahead. Have a blessed day :]|`|uCdyzzMjaa	I'm sure you've heard, Be careful what you wish for. This could be a great relationship, but after 6 years why are you really noticing him now? <br>  <br>  I wonder if there is something in your life that causes you to seek out the reassurance of a secure relationship now or the need to control a situation? Do you feel that some aspect of your life is out of your control and this new feeling for him is really a need to control something in your life? Maybe, or maybe you finally really saw him.  <br>  <br>  Whatever it is, let him choose what will happen next, be patient, he's likely a bit confused. Most important, if you want to keep the friendship, be honest with you feelings and intentions. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!

Same reason we have Santa at Christmas - to divert from the birth of Jesus.  Sad, really x x|`|7bc450c6091ac93a4d64108b856a5e7daa	Okay, "DEE DEE" is totally off. Its not a pagan tactic to "divert off the real meaning", its actually rooted in paganism, and has been sadly tied to the death and resurrection of our Lord and Savior.<br>  <br>   It is not a Christian holiday AT ALL. It is a celebration of the the pagan goddess 'astarte' of 'ashtoreth', aka 'eastre' or current english is 'easter', who is mentioned in the old testament, when God gets FURIOUS with Israel for worshipping her. <br>  <br>  Kings 11:33 "because they have forsaken Me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians...and they have not walked in My ways, doing what is right in My sight and observing My statutes and My ordinances, as his father David did." I guess God lets us do what we want now right?<br>  <br>  Check out this verse...Ezekiel 8: 5-18...here's a quick exerpt from verse 15-16 "Then He said to me, have you seen this, son of man?, Turn yet again, and you shall see greater abominations than these. V.16 -And he brought me into the inner court of The Lords house, and behold, at the door of the temple between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the SUN toward the east." Hmmm...sound like an easter sunrise service?<br>  <br>  Check this site out:  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/edn-t020.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiananswers.net/q-eden/e...</a><br>  <br>  just copy and paste it or something...kind of a lengthy read, but scroll down a bit and you'll get to the hare, egg, etc...<br>  <br>  Its a pet-peeve of mine when christians think it started with Jesus. No. Jesus is called the "Passover Lamb" for a reason. Not the easter lamb. He would think it to be an abomination that he is even remotely related to this pagan holiday, that has so many people in delusion, and so much money coming in from it. BTW, 'dee dee', dont even get me started on Christmas...again...do your research before you post an answer and sound ignorant.

I stopped growing at age 13/14, I was the tallest in my class... but by the time the same kids were 18 some of them sprouted past me. Look to your parents, aunts & uncles (biological relations, not through marriage), or even older siblings. Ask them when they stopped growing. <br>  <br>  But really, height is something you kinda have to just learn to accept and live with... hey, there are always heels and dressing styles that make you look taller. <br>  <br>  As for weight-- the good news is that it's an area where you have a choice. Be active, make good choices when you eat. That doesn't mean you can't treat yourself-- all things in moderation though. <br>  <br>  You will continue to lose "baby fat" as you grow, but that doesn't necessarily mean you get thinner, you just lose that youthful plumpness in features, but if you eat junk and lay around a lot, you'll probably gain weight that you don't want. Remember one of the best ways to look good, is to look healthy-- healthy hair, healthy skin, healthy body weight, healthy teeth. <br>  <br>  You're young but old enough to make your own choices so it's a good time to adopt a healthy lifestyle if you haven't already.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	I was only 4' 11" when I started 11th grade.

It's not that she can't afford them, it's that some of them are likely to have problems that will last their lifetimes and take hundreds of thousands of dollars to care for.  Some could be very mentally challenged.  Some could have cerebral palsy.  So, since she will need public assistance and knew that would be the case, why did she make the choice to agree to all 8 embryos?   <br>  <br>  The list goes on.  We are nosy, and we like to make sure our taxes are appropriated correctly.<br>  <br>  But she also showed a lack of insight into the problems that will now face her.  SHE got the ball rolling.

You are crazy lucky - and you should embrace it. <br>  <br>  oh, yeah, I have a secret for you, your dad will be a little insulted that you are offended at the idea that someone might confuse you for a lesbian. Yeah, I know, kids are brats and mean. You know that, too. Be a big kid, be a strong kid, and believe in yourself. My gut says your peers will respect you more for it in the end. Oh yeah, and you are changing the world for the better in the process. Pat yourself on the back for that one.<br>  <br>  Presuming you at some point have your eye on a certain guy, and presuming he's interested in you, I guarantee he'll feel just as much for you for being supportive of your dad.|`|AA10906922	You sound concerned your friends will judge you and say things that will hurt you. If they are your friends they will stand by you, if not then they aren't your friend. But it isn't any of their business. You seem to have a good relationship with your father and that is great. If anyone asks or it comes out somehow just stand by your dad because I believe he will stand by you. Friends will come and go but your father will always be there for you. But talk to your father about how you feel I'm sure he would love for you to share your feelings with him. The answer here is be the bigger person.

He can be how he is, you can be how you are. Tell your friends to stop being homophobes and assuming things about you.<br>  <br>  And beyond that... what's so wrong with being a lesbian?

Why can't one keep a reasonable balance.. each of you pays when you do some things together.. you may go to a restaurant.. you might invite your friend for a meal.. then she can pay her own petrol.. so something else.. <br>  <br>  In my friendship I have never felt obliged to give my best friend money for petrol.. she would have been offended..

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|GPmBB0Mvaa	YES YES YES YES YES<br>  YES YES YES YES<br>  YES YES YES<br>  YES YES<br>  YES<br>  <br>  If they didn't, I'd be single.|`|YbnEr1z7aa	no they are not.... that we know of!!!!!!!!!! lol.... no therer not|`|BiprMZQlaa	i don't really know|`|jeYyydb0aa	@ Lord<br>  <br>  There is only around 1 million people in US who have HIV aids, not 33million as you claim. It is extremely statistical unlikely that a white heterosexual male or female with no history of drug use will contract aids in there lifetime. Furthermore it is even more unlikely that a heterosexual male will contract aids from a female. <br>  <br>  Since you are wrong on this point vampires must be real.|`|V9d3qnUiaa	Personally I don't think they exist. IF they do exist, they will not let themselves be known, and definitely won't just up and tell you. <br>  <br>  Historically, vampires are interesting more because they reflect the medical ignorance of the time, rather than actual reality. Diseases such as porphyria were often linked to vampirism. Mental diseases were just demonic possessions...<br>  <br>  but I do think that they are an interesting myth, and even more interesting now, because they are changing. They are no longer bestial, but human, with human desires and even a heart. <br>  <br>  LM|`|3ox4lYu6aa	Read this.

Xsen794Aaa	That's just how it is.  When you learn other languages, it helps if you go in with the understanding that many things just don't translate.  You already see some of that in the case that the direct-object pronoun comes BEFORE the verb instead of after like in English.  In the case of "manquer," it's just that the concept of "miss" is different in French than it is in English.  <br>  <br>  In English, "miss" is an verb of emotion just like "to love," in French, you say "You miss me" like a passenger can miss catching a train or a bus, so since they have "missed catching" us, and therefore, not with us now.  Then we're sad, and therefore, in English, we "miss" them.<br>  <br>  By the way, you don't put an indefinite article before things like professions (including students), religions and nationalities when you're describing people, "question" is feminine, and the comma goes inside the quotations.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Cause in French, as in Spanish....I don't miss you...you miss yourself to me...that's just the way they say it...<br>  <br>  There's a whole class of expressions that work that way...|`|81bda06b67f3aa041e733ff5f2351395aa	ln French to miss is manquer de, so i miss you is je manque DE toi, therefore tu me manques.|`|0c63fdd0630be2f6cbd717d497ab2474aa	In grammatical terms, the verb "miss" in English is a dually subcategorized verb that allows transitivity alteration. What this means is that the following two sentences "This puzzle is missing a piece" and "A piece is missing from this puzzle" mean exactly the same thing, even though the subject of the first is the complement of the second, and the complement of the first is the subject of the second. Similarly, we could say (though we tend not to) "You are missing from me" to mean the same thing as "I miss you".<br>  <br>  In French, the verb "manquer" does not allow transitivity alteration. That means one can only say "Tu me manques" to say "I miss you/You are missing from me" and not "Je te manque". "Je te manque" means the complete opposite of "Tu me manques" in French.<br>  <br>  As for why this English verb allows transitivity alteration and the French verb does not... well, there's no simple answer to that. It just has to do with how the two languages have evolved over time. Though they are very similar, there are a lot of little differences between French and English like this.

gkqmrIAGaa	I can tell you number one that if he was dating her when she was 13 an it looks like he was 18 this is statutory rape. This is a prison sentence and sexual abuse, I can't understand how your mother could have allowed that it can still be reported if anyone wants to do it. The next problem is that at the age of 13 he pretty much got control of her mind and body this is extremely hard for her in having the ability to get out of the relationship. Try talking to her about her self esteem, what she thinks of herself. If she had good self esteem she would understand that she doesn't deserve this kind of behavior. She needs to understand that this will be her life, a life with men just like him who will abuse her as she actually feels so bad about herself that this is what she deserves. He is making a choice to take the Xanax which he knows causes him to abuse her physically. If she is thinking poor him he can't help it, he can and he is responsible for his actions.  Because of her age of 13 when she started the we will call it sickness with him she truly needs some therapy. Your sister has to know that she doesn't deserve this, she deserves to be happy and loved. I am sorry but your mother created this problem and she needs to step up and take some responsibility and get your sister into therapy. Your sister has to know that the next relationship and the next will be with abuser. You sound like such a good sister and this is a load on you and I hope that you can help her with the strength and courage to get out of this sick relationship. She doesn't really love him even though she may believe that. She has become dependant on him and he wouldn't be doing this if he loved her.|`|7hmGQTf1aa	Find some time for a non-comfrontational talk with her...<br>  Ask her how it is going... ask about him.  Maybe ask why she stays with him and try to listen to her answer.  Use logic with her, and make sure you are on her side and that she knows that.  <br>  I would do some research on Xanax (or any drug) dependance/abuse so that you have good information on the subject to share with her.  Make sure she knows you love her and are worried about her, and perhaps point out that they got together very young.  Maybe this isn't the right relationship for her anymore.<br>  Whatever you say, make sure she knows you are saying all this to help her because you want what is best for her.  She may not listen to you right away, but hopefully you will plant a seed in her mind.<br>  This is not a good situation, and it can be very difficult to get her to a point where she feels strong enough to leave or otherwise make a change.  Regardless, she needs to know that she can confide in and trust you.<br>  Best of luck.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	He's full of crap! XANAX Calms you Down. Not riles you up! I Know because my husband takes it, and he is 100 times better than he used to be. If he is abusing xanax and abusing your sister, he needs intervention from his doctor. Tell her to GET OUT, and that he is not worth her time. Poor Him will soon be Poor Her if she doesn't get out now. If she won't listen to you, then schedule an intervention. This has to be stopped.|`|SnpP6dGFaa	just have a girls night out with her (are you older than her or younger?) if you're older than this is easier.  Tell her he may have a problem...but that being abusive is never ok and not a healthy relationship.  That she may have a connection with him but she needs to realize that they are much better men out there.  One's who will hold her and protect him from men like him.  One's that will buy her flowers on valentines day and bring home chocolates once and a while for her.|`|9b959ce79253c06d59afb5fb0580d517aa	Abused women have low self-esteem and they nearly always return back to their abuser. An abused woman needs to experience a change in thought patterns very much like a light switch flicking on.<br>  <br>  I would:<br>  <br>  1. Inform the entire family.<br>  <br>  2. Inform his family.<br>  <br>  3. Inform friends.<br>  <br>  4. Surround her with information.<br>  <br>  5. Help to build up her self-esteem within a social environment, not obviously, but allow her to be the assertive person in group situation sometimes (others should work to help this eventuate).<br>  <br>  <br>  Do not assist him by keeping his dirty little secret a secret - expose this abuser. Your sister won't like it, but she's not very good at making the right choices at the moment.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - Pepper.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I'm sorry, but your mother is an idiot and one of his enablers.  Your mother is teaching the two of them (and you) that his behaviour is acceptable. <br>  <br>  If you can't help your sister then help yourself and get away from your family. Be assertive and realise that this is very unhealthy.<br>  <br>  Your mother is in the wrong.|`|AA12152549	You're sister's right in saying that boyfriend has a problem because he obviously does.  She also has a problem in that she lets him get away with abusing her.  This is not helping him and it's not helping her.  There is no reason for her to think that by staying with him he will change his nasty behavior.  She should get out of this destructive relationship as soon as possible.  Also it would be very wise of her to seek professional counseling about what's been going on here.  She is an adult and has to take charge of her own life and not live under the domination of an abuser.  By the way, she can report incidents of physical abuse to the police.  Assault and battery are against the law everywhere.

SE2xiEupaa	Don't worry! My partner and I have the same "routine". We both work full time, and I am in school part time.

It is nothing to worry about though!! :)|`|gspTDufpaa	About a week whenever either one of us is out of town.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	Two weeks is nothing, no worries.<br>  <br>  I emailed you Texan ,which I never do on here. Wanted to see what part of big Tx. you are from.|`|PKULDaC7aa	Yeah, we sometimes go about 2 weeks. Sometimes we just end up passing out on the couch and, as you said, time gets away from us. I've noticed that a lot of times we have to specifically make time for it.|`|dsf5hGGnaa	Probably a week.|`|DIj072Sqaa	Cuddling up is better than sex|`|upvd5TRRaa	it's been a good 4 weeks probably for me.<br>  <br>  EDIT: LOL at linda c's answer!|`|bAUO9Yhdaa	A couple of days!<br>  <br>  No, just kidding, I don't have a significant other to not have sex with.

My wife and I have a great relationship and we will go a couple weeks without sex without even noticing.  So much is going on, different schedule, kids, events everyday chores etc.   Don't let it worry you, sounds like you've got a great relationship as long as your partner agrees.  Sex often gets thrown to the back burner when you get that feeling of,,,,,I can get it anytime I want it at home,,,,,,,then it just is an easy thing to put off because you assume she will always be there.  When you are single you are out there having fun, doing whatever you want and you don't have to dedicate as much time to the relationship and so you may not be together as much so whenever you get together your tagging each other,,,,lolololo,, just a fact.  My wife and I kid each other about the time inbetween each time sometimes but its always been a joke,, if it's not this way with your partner then you may develop issues.  We, I like to say are like a baseball team through the year.  Will go on some win a few in a row, lose a few in a row, go on some great winning streaks and then there are those losing streaks.  Bottom line,,,, Are you happy????  if yes thats all that matters.  It's a lot easier to find someone to tag but much much harder to find someone who you can trust, who's there for you whenever needed and what I really appreciate is how much we both know each other and can damn near read each others mind.   Nothing like having the security of someone who loves you completely.|`|rlrbnd4Xaa	Damn Texan my questions won't post. i tried everything i changed my name and avatar and made a new account and nothing.i am going to run a muck now maybe then that bias yahoo moderator will let my questions post|`|eYmIlVnGaa	usually we have it about twice a day when we have time but we arent always together and have gone months without it.|`|C5RPnIzFaa	Well, its been over a month.<br>  <br>  But our ann is coming up, and with that comes the fun.|`|EwqtAmQWaa	at most 5-6 days depending on how long does my wife's period last|`|iTf0l9Wlaa	we have gone about 2 weeks but that was before now we have sex almost ever night but you shouldn't worry time used to get away from us to but it all depends whats going on in your life|`|SFW3hSrQaa	don't really care along|`|MYIwyTpcaa	18 hours, but that's just us..as long as neither one of you are feeling neglected, then 2 weeks isn't a big problem.

Just because it happens in Canada doesn't mean that Canadians aren't against it as well.  I'm totally against the seal hunt and there are many organizations within Canada that try to stop it every year. <br>  I've already noticed Canadians and Americans warming up to eachother much more since Obama's been elected as President.

You can also chat with Mormon missionaries and order media items (books, videos, etc).  <br>  <br>  Joseph Smith wrote the Articles of Faith of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  They are as follows:<br>  <br>  1.  We believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  2.  We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.<br>  <br>  3.  We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.<br>  <br>  4.  We believe that the first four principles and ordinances of the gospel are: first, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.<br>  <br>  5.  We believe that a man must be called of God, by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.<br>  <br>  6.  We believe in the same organization that existed in the Primitive Church, namely, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so forth.<br>  <br>  7.  We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelations, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.<br>  <br>  8.  We believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.<br>  <br>  9.  We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  10.  We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion (the New Jerusalem) will be built upon the American continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth; and, that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisical glory.<br>  <br>  11.  We claim the privilege of worshipping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.<br>  <br>  12.  We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers, and magistrates, in obeying, honoring, and sustaining the law.<br>  <br>  13.  We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul--We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things.

hOf38vgpaa	First we need to realize that according to Spencer Wells, PhD Harvard and Director of the Genographic Project, 75,000 years ago all our ancestors were probably still living in East Africa as one family. So there has not been much time since we separated from our common ancestor in East Africa, for there to be any significant deep genetic differences among us. Most of our differences are skin deep. <br>  <br>  Over the last 50,000 years humans began to move out of Africa in waves of migrations, as the Ice Age came to an end and temperatures began to rise. Once outside of Africa the Ice Age returned and populations got stranded, isolated from each other the populations started developing an exaggerated "look", depending upon the environment and what the opposite sex in the tribes liked and disliked. This look is what we know as Races.<br>  <br>  Over the last 50,000 years populations have had to migrate due to these weather changes. They came in contact with each other and they intermarried. As you can see from the following map there is no such thing as a Pure race:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mcdonald/WorldHaplogroupsMaps.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mcdonald/WorldH...</a><br>  <br>  Most Western Europeans belong to haplogroup R. You can see R is also pretty common as far away as India and Iran. Near Greece and Italy there is considerable amount of Middle Eastern haplogroup J. So, the conclusion is, races have been mixing from the beginning of time. <br>  <br>  By the way, scientists have managed to isolate Neandertal DNA. Comparing it to human DNA scientists discovered that there are no human men who descend from Neandertal men. We are all descendants of one man who lived in East Africa, about 75,000 years ago.|`|e9gXZsKxaa	40,000 years ago when the cro-magnon (homo sapiens) interbred with the neanderthals (homo sapiens neandertalensis) is the actual first encounter with mix nationalities.|`|4BQXYxPYaa	You make an initial assumption that there were "primary" races to begin with.<br>  <br>  Human populations are very dynamic and humans are prone to developing spontaneous mutations which can be passed on to the next generation. It's likely that pre-human populations were fairly dynamic as well.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as pure race, but rather, it's a spectrum. Humans evolved in Africa and the first people who could be considered humans were likely dark. This does not mean that early humans looked like modern day Africans or that modern day Africans are "less evovled" because they have darker skin. They are simply well adapted to their environment. Lighter skin arose a bit later in history as humans started to move out of Africa and into Europe and Asia. Of the groups that left Africa which spawned lighter humans, those groups either had to contain a gene mutation that caused lighter skin, or the mutation had to eventually develop. As these dark skinned people began to move into environments with less UV light, which the human body manufactuers into vitamin D (prevents rickets), and could not find food sources with sufficient amounts of vitamin D, it's likely that those with darker skin developed health problems due to lack of vitamin D and were unable to ultimately reproduce (maybe they died a bit younger from broken bone complications), leaving the few who had somewhat lighter skin (who could absorb more UV light). And this process continued to repeat until the most of the population had this mutation.<br>  <br>  Very dark skinned people in countries like the United Kingdom seldom develop rickets today because most food is vitamin fortified. European Australians, however, have a rate of skin cancer 8 times greater than that of Europeans in the U.K. because of the intense amount of UV light Australia receives.<br>  <br>  But anyway, there never was a pure race so everyone is mixed.|`|0e25685ff349a735e0e9b97df9fd76c4aa	Geez, that is a good question.<br>  Wasn't the Portuguese a mixed race as well though.

biWJ0rydaa	Okay, the way I was taught, the imperfect is for past, habitual actions or actions that occur over a somewhat extended period of time. The preterite are actions that happen and are completed in an instant.<br>  The first verb in the sentence is normally the imperfect and then second is the preterite.<br>  <br>  Take this sentence for example.<br>  <br>  I was driving down the road when a deer ran in front of me.<br>  <br>  You were driving down the road probably for some time. The deer ran in front of you and interrupted that action. It is something that happened all of a sudden in an instant and the action is completed.<br>  <br>  There are also other things the preterite and imperfect are used for such as the preterite is used when the action took place during a certain time or the imperfect is used for stating mental statuses.<br>  <br>  The perterite is used for:<br>  For actions that can be viewed as single events <br>  For actions that were repeated a specific number of times <br>  For actions that occurred during a specific period of time <br>  For actions that were part of a chain of events <br>  To state the beginning or the end of an action <br>  <br>  The imperfect is used for:<br>  For actions that were repeated habitually <br>  For actions that "set the stage" for another past action <br>  For telling time <br>  For stating one's age <br>  For mental states (usually) <br>  For physical sensations (usually) <br>  To describe the characteristics of people, things or conditions <br>  <br>  If you need more help try this website (it's also where I got those lists)<br>  <a href="http://www.studyspanish.com/lessons/pretimp4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.studyspanish.com/lessons/pret...</a>|`|OY4sHHiAaa	preterite =  verb tense that indicates that an action taken once in the past was completed at a specific point in time in the past.

Must drive you insane.|`|E7fguoVBaa	I think Hebrew.<br>  <br>  While the Bible does not specifically say, the implication is that the language in which Moses began the writing of the inspired Sacred Record was the same as that spoken by the first man.<br>  <br>  If history was put in written form before the Flood, such history would contribute notably to the preservation of the purity of the original tongue. Even if that history were passed on by oral tradition, it would still serve to maintain the stability of the original speech. The extreme care that the Jews of later times showed in endeavoring to conserve the true form of the Sacred Record illustrates the concern that would surely have been shown in patriarchal times to transmit accurately the earliest record of God’s dealings with men.<br>  <br>  Further reason for believing that the Hebrew of the Bible accurately represents the “one language” of pre-Babel times is the remarkable stability of the Hebrew language during the thousand-year period in which the Hebrew Scriptures were written. As The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia states: “One of the most remarkable facts connected with the Hebrew of the O[ld] T[estament] is that, although its literature covers a period of over a thousand years, the language (grammar and vocabulary) of the oldest parts differs little from that of the latest.”—Edited by G.?W. Bromiley, 1982, Vol. 2, p. 659.<br>  <br>  Knowledge of the Language Incomplete. In reality, knowledge of ancient Hebrew is by no means complete. As Professor Burton L.?Goddard says: “In large measure, the O[ld] T[estament] Hebrew must be self explanatory.” (The Zondervan Pictorial Bible Dictionary, edited by M.?Tenney, 1963, p. 345) This is because so few other contemporaneous writings in the Hebrew language have been found that could contribute to an understanding of the word usage. Among those of any importance are the Gezer calendar (a simple list of agricultural operations thought to date from the tenth century?B.C.E.; PICTURE, Vol. 1, p. 960), some ostraca (inscribed pieces of broken pottery) from Samaria (mainly orders and receipts for wine, oil, and barley and generally assigned to the early part of the eighth century?B.C.E.), the Siloam inscription (found in a water tunnel of Jerusalem and believed to date from the reign of King Hezekiah [745-717?B.C.E.]), and the Lachish ostraca (probably from the latter part of the seventh century?B.C.E.).<br>  <br>  Additionally, there is a Phoenician inscription on the sarcophagus of King Ahiram in Byblos (Gebal), its language closely resembling Hebrew and thought to be from the start of the first millennium?B.C.E.; also the Moabite Stone, apparently from the late tenth or early ninth century?B.C.E. The language on the Moabite Stone is very similar to Hebrew, as might be expected in view of the Moabites’ descent from Abraham’s nephew Lot.—Ge 19:30-37.<br>  <br>  The total of the information on all these inscriptions, however, is but a small fraction of that found in the Hebrew Scriptures.<br>  <br>  The Hebrew Scriptures themselves, though covering a wide range of subjects and employing an extensive vocabulary, by no means contain all the words or expressions of ancient Hebrew. The Siloam inscription and the Lachish ostraca, for example, contain certain word and grammatical constructions that do not appear in the Hebrew Scriptures, yet these constructions are clearly of Hebrew origin. Undoubtedly the ancient vocabulary of the Hebrew-speaking people contained many more “root” words, plus thousands of words derived from these, than are known today.<br>  <br>  Aside from those portions of the Bible definitely known to be written in Aramaic, there are quite a number of words and expressions found in the Hebrew Scriptures for which the original “roots” are unknown. Lexicographers classify many of these as “loanwords,” claiming that Hebrew borrowed these from other Semitic tongues, such as Aramaic, Akkadian, or Arabic. This is speculation, however. As Edward Horowitz states: “But sometimes the borrowing is so ancient that scholars do not know which language did the borrowing and which was the original owner.” (How the Hebrew Language Grew, pp. 3,?5) It seems more probable that such questioned terms are genuinely Hebrew and are further evidence of the incompleteness of modern knowledge of the scope of the ancient language.<br>  <br>  Among the evidences pointing to a rich vocabulary in ancient Hebrew are writings from the start of the Common Era. These include non-Biblical religious writings forming part of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and also the Mishnah, a body of rabbinic writings in Hebrew dealing with Jewish tradition. Writing in The Encyclopedia Americana (1956, Vol. XIV,  p.?57a), Professor Meyer Waxman says: “Biblical Hebrew .?.?. does not exhaust the entire stock of words, as is proved by the Mishnah, which employs hundreds of Hebrew words not found in the Bible.” Of course, some of these could have been later additions or coined expressions, but doubtless many were part of the Hebrew vocabulary during the period of the writing of the Hebrew Scriptures.|`|5744d400c7b6633cfb6929833cb9470daa	THE  ORIGINAL  LANGUAGE  IS  ANCIENT  HEBREW  AND  NO  ONE  GRUNTED  OR  SOME  OTHER  NONSENSE  ADAM AND  EVE  WERE  MOST  ARTICULATE|`|QOnkXzriaa	Aramaic

Peter was directly taught the truth that stands 4ever unchanged by Jesus & Jesus prepared him 2 head the church on Jesus's & God's behalf starting with Jewish ppl while Jesus was alive (Peter [the Rock is Jesus not Peter - Peter imitates Jesus but wasnt Jesus or replacing Jesus like the pope does] & the 11 other Apostles [yes, Judas had 2 b replaced so that the original 12 Pillars the church foundation was 2 b built on would remain intact in accordance with scripture] were killed off or died within the 1rst century - Christianity was illegal most of that time & the Bible shows corruption was already getting in2 some original churches).<br>  <br>  Most of the original disciples were also killed off, died or they backed down b/c they were severely intimidated during that time.

This made it much easier 4 those who wanted use the Christian label 4 other purposes 2 enter in & sow their corruption (especially since most couldnt read or write @ that time - The Cc claims they didnt give out Bibles 4 over 1000 yrs b/c no1 could read but why didnt they just teach ppl 2 read?).<br>  <br>  Rest-assured Jesus/the Apostles never authorized Apostolic succession 2 the Cc [the final 12 werent 2 b replaced - God's fixed order of things Biblical] - the next so-called generation inserted even more corrupt practices that became part of the fundamental beliefs @ the start of "official Cc" about 325 AD @ the time of Constantine + more false Pagan type practices were added.<br>  <br>  Its not possible 4 a church 2 know Jesus without knowing Jesus' actual Biblical instructions - absent in Cc teachings (the Cc didnt write any part of the NT [not a Cc text or their writings - NT was written in the 1rst century by Apostles {NT Gospels/letters preserved the truth 4 all people [purpose 4 it being written] not the Cc - God allowed the Cc 2 produce the Bible dispite their wrong teachings like He allowed the Romans 2 fulfill prophecy without their knowledge [happening again today]}.<br>  <br>  In other words, God & Jesus already fully knew what was 2 b written in the NT, that is the truth is complete within its pages (& the NT proves the OT is true & the OT reinforces the truth of the NT [the 2 witnesses]). It wasnt the Cc that preserved the truth (far from it). Cc possession was not until about the 4th century] which contradicts their teachings/practices & God's will, 1 in truth & Spirit not rituals.<br>  <br>  Regrettably, the Cc made the same mistake many made, they didnt follow Jesus' Biblical instructions when they set up the Cc. 2 main lies r (which cancels out their other teachings - most of which arnt Biblical anyway [see below] - another false gospel among many & the real revisionist church history):<br>  <br>  1. The CC claims 2 b the 1rst church & that since they r the longest existing church, they r the only "official" church. Jesus' Apostles never named their church "catholic (not in the Bible nor in line with God's message that never changes)" nor did they ever practice Cc religious rituals. There was nearly a 250 year gap btwn Jesus' original Apostle's church & the start of the "official" Cc - there4, the Cc was never a part of or the true 1rst Christian Church (neither a label, title, name, its history, size of membership, amount of time it existed or claims made about them proves anything - its whats practiced (with respect 2 the real Biblical truth) that makes it either the truth or a lie. Calling a dog god doesnt make it God. U can call anything anything).<br>  <br>  2. Peter was never a pope nor was he or his fellow Apostles ever a member of the Cc (it isnt in the Bible = no apostolic succession) the use of the word pope is a Cc invention - the Bible instructs us not 2 go beyond whats written (I Cor 4:6; Rev 22:18-19). Peter was never a bishop of the Cc (he was already dead about 250 years b4 the Cc became a church. Peter would never call himself a pope or b a member of the Cc b/c calling 1self Father is an abomination. Even the devil knows Jesus is the Son of God so 1 would b wise not 2 trust any church ahead of whats written in the Bible. Calling yourself a Christian or saying u believe in Jesus doesnt make it true.<br>  <br>  No matter how much well-meaning people (religious or not) read the Bible they cant find Jesus Christ without going directly 2 Jesus thru His Biblical instructions (Jn 5:39; 10:1,7; 3:3,5). God outsmarted man - the Bible is the only 1 that cant be properly understood without Jesus (Jn 14:6; II Cor 3:14, Is 29:11-12 - If Jewish people cant pierce the veil over the OT without Jesus then 4 sure all gentiles cant). Thats why theres many interpretations & many thinking its fairy tales/a delusion (Jesus came bearing the sword of division).<br>  <br>  The Bible severely warns us not 2 trust humans, not even ourselves, clergy/churches (Jer 10:2-5,23; Is 2:22; Job 12:11; Prov 14:12; Acts 17:11). So carefully think over what I say. Dont just believe or dismiss what I write. It might save u from making the same mistake many made, getting caught up in religious beliefs having nothing 2 do with knowing God (poisoned tree & its fruit). I.e. Many claim God is love & love ur neighbor but they dont know what God's actual definition of love is nor His application of it.<br>  <br>  Other wrong Cc practices/rituals that dont lead u 2 Jesus:<br>  <br>  Mass (not in the Bible) is full of non-biblical rituals, Statues (God isnt in2 dead things - non-living things can't help or save any1 - praying 2 them is an abomination), the Rosary, mother Mary (virgin 2 Jesus' birth) as interceder (Jesus is the only way 2 God - not His Apostles/disciples - Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:12; IS 1 - Mary was a sinner & had children after Jesus - Mt 12:46-50), candles, incense, the cross (its more a symbol of the curse rather than Jesus & 4 the same reasoning against statues), making the sign of the cross, stations of the cross, the pope's & other leader's garb they wear, confirmation, the Catholic creed & other Catholic documents, raising dead/people 2 the status of "saint" (only God & Jesus have authority 2 do this), purgatory, catechism, devotionals, sacraments, holy eucharist, penance, traditional/repetative type prayers & many other things they do rnt coming from the Bible (again, cancels out any truth as it cant b mixed with false teachings).<br>  <br>  Its b/c religion is about man & what he likes, not what Jesus mandated us 2 do 2 know Him. The result is few will end up saved thru most of them (no1 can save themselves by their own inititve nor will good deeds save them - theres no good in any man - Rom 1:23). 1 must be very careful not 2 get sucked in or going 2 various denominations (especially if u dont have a good handle on whats actually written in the Bible) as u can only add 2 any confusion ur experiencing.<br>  <br>  Just b/c religions made many fatal mistakes doesnt mean God doesnt know what He's doing. The main point missed: Jesus is the only 1 in history who said that no1 can find our real God except thru Jesus (Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:11). This means "the" truth was complete & there4 finished thru what Jesus taught & did. So, any so-called new teaching & any other religious beliefs r null & void & cant lead u 2 God. The truth is either the whole truth or it isnt the truth. The truth is the absence of any lie. Either Jesus told the whole truth or He's a false prophet, among many, whom should be disregarded. This would also mean that God must not exist either (He either knows what He's doing or He cant be God).<br>  <br>  But, heres evidence God knows what He's doing. Jesus couldnt hv done nor said what He did unless He had full understanding of the entire OT (the NT didnt exist @ the time of Jesus - the only way Jesus couldve known the whole OT is if God was with Him). & the Apostles couldnt write the NT unless Jesus allowed them 2 remember & know what He was here 4 (Lk 24:25-27,45). Not possible unless God caused it.<br>  <br>  A church thats very serious about finding the Biblical truth, understands what being Born Anew is about, might be able 2 help u but no1 can save u except Jesus (Jn 3:1-14 - note: Nicodemus was very religious but Jesus flatout told him he had missed the 1rst most important step, that he must b Born Anew or no matter how religious or good he thought he is he couldn't go 2 Heaven (Jn 3:3,5; Jn 14:6; Acts 4:12). No1 can live without breaking God's Law = sin which separates us from God (why we need 2 b Born Anew the right way).<br>  <br>  A teaching can hv a truth in whats written but the action taken can b superficial or false - The Cc like the Pharisees know how 2 clean the outside of the cup but dont understand how the inside is 2 b cleaned with respect 2 Jesus' actual message. The fact that the Cc & other religions retain an altar @ the center of their religious practices is 1 sure sign of their being about religious rituals not the truth that stands 4ever unchanged.<br>  <br>  voyc4rmwldrns|`|caFCuaFiaa	No; and I never will.

And ... not sure where you are coming from on the God assumptions. No one knows the mind of God. In your example, the 'God' would simply be the role of a plantation overseer. A lot of religions believe different things about God. For example a God who created a creation in which choice was offered.

Such a God would not simply be content to come down, show himself, toss lightning ... for that would make him nothing more than an idol and the opposite of he intent.|`|gn0LrrSRaa	Because people have something in their mind and they want to get it across to other people.

Sometimes I work the overnight shift and we talk.  Dr's, nurses and security guards all have stories of seeing ghosts there at night, of chairs rocking with no one in them, call buttons going off when no one is occupying the room, patients wandering the halls at night (this would never happen because each patient and room is monitored tightly).  The night watchman told me the other night he had just gotten a call from a night nurst that there was a tall thin bald man with a trench coat looking at gifts in the gift shop.  This was about 2 am.  I said, "Did you catch him?"  He reminded me that the door was locked yet the man was inside and when he got there the door was still locked and the man was gone.  And his boss said they have gotten that call many times before, the same man in the gift shop looking at the gifts.  These are reputable people and they all have their stories.  Many people die every week here and I think some of them don't leave right away after they die.

One time a new member of staff was poking around in the basement.

Which indeed he had, but he didn't know that there was a centurion to be seen - because NO ONE HAD TOLD HIM THE PLACE WAS HAUNTED, let alone by what sort of ghost.<br>  <br>  Stories like this might just be made up to entertain tourists, but there are a lot of them about and I cannot put hand on heart and say they're all BS.  I merely observe that ghosts never catch up with us.  They're always stuck back in the time from which allegedly come and they don't know we're here.

If the kid resists and a normal argument ensues, it' not abuse.<br>  <br>  What kids have to understand is that as long as they are minors, it is a parent's right to decide these things for them.

It is most unpleasant.<br>  <br>  People who speak without thinking (when angry for example)may not associate anything with these words. But being civilized involves carefully thought and weighed words. <br>  Funnily enough, swear words are used even as exclamations of delight among young people !!<br>  One tends to associate class (not socio-economic, but quality of character) with usage of swear words, so the non users are referred to as "pretentious donkeys" :)<br>  <br>  edit: when used to refer to the actual meaning (for instance, excreta), the  alternate word (sh*t), is relatively acceptable....lol ...just that etiquette demands a tactful usage of language - with correct grammar and no colloquial/slang terms.<br>  its only if you want to use the words "figuratively" or with malice towards someone that it is offensive.<br>  edit 2: The word is a "vulgarity" even when used in the correct reference as it does not conform to literature. The same word is a "profanity" (or a Swear word) when used (literally incorrectly) to offend.<br>  Since your question is about 'swear words', it automatically means the latter.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	When I was young and foolish I got in trouble a lot too.  One time a cop came over to my table in a restaurant and told us to knock off the swearing.  The difference between you and me is that I understood their displeasure with my language even then.

Some idiot is f*&^ this and f*&^ that.  He wasn't insulting anyone.  So, you tell me, should I have been upset that he's using that kind of language in front of my 9 year old?  I was!  And I told him to knock it off!<br>  <br>  Look, until I became a dad, I cussed like a sailor.  I knew it was stupid then and there was NO WAY I was going to be the one to teach my children such naughty words.  They are just raunch tossed into everyday language with no real purpose of meaning.  As I've explained to my kids: One guy says, "He did good!" and the other says, "He did d$@%ed good!"  D$@%ed means doomed by God!  So, tell me children, how is it that the one guy did a kind of good that was doomed by God?  It's just stupid!<br>  <br>  You want to defend the use of the f-word?  S**t?  And others like them?  They are low class, lazy mind speech.  It shows your immaturity.  People don't want to hear you spew such filth out of your mouth!  As Dorothy Parker once said, "With a mouth like that, you should wear a diaper on your face."  What's the point?
AA12006309	*sigh*  At least once a day this gets asked.<br>  <br>  A pansexual is someone who is gender blind in their relationships.  This means that when choosing a relationship partner, gender is not a deciding factor.<br>  <br>  This also means that they are willing to have relationships with people outside the gender binary.  The gender binary is the idea that there are only two genders - male and female.  Pansexual people may choose partners who are male, female, transgender, transsexual, intersex, etc.<br>  <br>  Being a pansexual does not make a person promiscuous, and does not mean they have no standards.

I5pUxwPbaa	yes divorce is frowned upon in Islam, marriage is very important and taken very seriously. But divorces do happen in certain cirumstances where the marriage cannot be saved|`|423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	Although heavily discouraged, divorce is permissible in Islam.  It exists as a safety valve for a failed marriage which has no possibility of progress or development.  Allah does not want a couple to remain in misery and sustain emotional, physical, and financial damage.  Thus, Allah explains the laws and rules of divorce in a chapter of the Qur'an called "Divorce."[Holy Quran, Chapter 65, "At-Talaq"]  <br>  <br>  Islam encourages reconciliation between the spouses, and their families and friends have the responsibility to help them with this as much as possible, but if this process ultimately fails then the last resort is divorce.  After divorce, there is a waiting period for women to consider their life and the fate of their children.  Most people go back to their spouses sometime during this waiting period, but if it elapses and the two people show no interest in returning to each other, then the divorce will be finalized.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	Ibn 'Umar reported, The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allāh be on him, said<br>  <br>  "With Allāh, the most detestable of all things permitted is divorce."<br>  <br>  (AD. 13:1)|`|8yaYafBAaa	Its the thing that Allah swt hates most but has made it permissible|`|ombfkcfNaa	One of our religion's great aspects in giving women their freedom is divorce. Islam gave it when every other religion women were oppressed and trapped in a tumultuous marriage. Now, that doesn't mean at the sight of every trouble you get annulled. When a man asks for a woman's hand, he must believe and want in his heart for it to continue. In time, if some marriages cannot be pulled together then couples divorce. It is frowned upon, yes, but it's not forbidden because its halal.|`|ORbFRn4oaa	From a Quranic perspective,<br>  <br>  Divorce cannot be given the way it is practiced today.<br>  <br>  The couple that has decided to separate, have to stay together for 4 months. If they are still firm for a divorce, then the divorce has occurred. If NOT then they are still married.<br>  <br>  However, such retraction i.e. to decide to stay together on or before the end of 4 month period, is allowed ONLY 2 times. The third time if the couple decides for a divorce, then they are NOT allowed to reconcile in the 4 month period. In this case the 4 month period will ONLY act as to ensure that the woman is not pregnant with the child of the man.|`|4sc7bMbkaa	its allowed if they tried really best and then unable to safe it!!|`|Ztiy3jjwaa	Al-Hadith: Abu Daud:<br>  "The most hateful of all lawful things, in the sight of Allah (Subhanahu wa Ta'ala), is Talaq (divorce)".|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	well<br>  yr allowed to have 4 wives? so i guess its not haram

Simple common sense.  <br>  <br>  John 14:28: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”<br>  <br>  Matthew 26:39: “Going a little farther he [Jesus Christ] fell on his face and prayed, ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.’” (If the Father and the Son were not distinct individuals, such a prayer would have been meaningless. Jesus would have been praying to himself, and his will would of necessity have been the Father’s will.)<br>  <br>  Matthew 20:20-23: “The mother of the sons of Zebedee .?.?. said to him [Jesus], ‘Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.’ But Jesus answered, .?.?. ‘You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.’” (How strange, if, as claimed, Jesus is God! Was Jesus here merely answering according to his “human nature”? If, as Trinitarians say, Jesus was truly “God-man”—both God and man, not one or the other—would it truly be consistent to resort to such an explanation? Does not Matthew 20:23 rather show that the Son is not equal to the Father, that the Father has reserved some prerogatives for himself?)<br>  <br>  What is the origin of the Trinity doctrine?<br>  <br>  The New Encyclop?dia Britannica says: “Neither the word Trinity, nor the explicit doctrine as such, appears in the New Testament, nor did Jesus and his followers intend to contradict the Shema in the Old Testament: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord’ (Deut. 6:4). .?.?. The doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through many controversies. .?.?. By the end of the 4th century .?.?. the doctrine of the Trinity took substantially the form it has maintained ever since.”—(1976), Microp?dia, Vol. X, p. 126.<br>  <br>  The New Catholic Encyclopedia states: “The formulation ‘one God in three Persons’ was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, prior to the end of the 4th century. But it is precisely this formulation that has first claim to the title the Trinitarian dogma. Among the Apostolic Fathers, there had been nothing even remotely approaching such a mentality or perspective.”—(1967), Vol. XIV, p. 299.<br>  <br>  In The Encyclopedia Americana we read: “Christianity derived from Judaism and Judaism was strictly Unitarian [believing that God is one person]. The road which led from Jerusalem to Nicea was scarcely a straight one. Fourth century Trinitarianism did not reflect accurately early Christian teaching regarding the nature of God; it was, on?the contrary, a deviation from this teaching.”—(1956), Vol.?XXVII, p. 294L.<br>  <br>  According to the Nouveau Dictionnaire Universel, “The Platonic trinity, itself merely a rearrangement of older trinities dating back to earlier peoples, appears to be the rational philosophic trinity of attributes that gave birth to the three hypostases or divine persons taught by the Christian churches. .?.?. This Greek philosopher’s [Plato, fourth century?B.C.E.] conception of the divine trinity .?.?. can be?found?in all the ancient [pagan] religions.”—(Paris, 1865-1870), edited by M. Lachatre, Vol. 2, p. 1467.<br>  <br>  John L. McKenzie, S.J., in his Dictionary of the Bible, says: “The trinity of persons within the unity of nature is defined in terms of ‘person’ and ‘nature’ which are G[ree]k philosophical terms; actually the terms do not appear in the Bible. The trinitarian definitions arose as the result of long controversies in which these terms and others such as ‘essence’ and ‘substance’ were erroneously applied to God by some theologians.”—(New York, 1965), p. 899.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	after his baptism he went into the wilderness and Satan tempted him 3 times...each time he rebuked Satan....and said IT IS TO JEHOVAH ALONE WE MUST RENDER SACRED SERVICE.<br>  <br>  He never said to worship him....he said we must all pray this way...Our father in heaven, hallowed be thy name (Jehovah) ( not Jesus)<br>  <br>  Proof positive that Jesus is not Jehovah God...Jesus  died.....The bible says Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting...so part of him could never have died...and yet his creation, his only begotten son...did die.|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	Worship is nothing to be afraid of.

How can jesus do that if he is not god. That what ever is bound on earth will be bound in heaven and loosed or allowed on earth will be allowed in heaven. Only God can do that not a human being who is not god not even a angel can do that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mat 16:27  For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works. <br>  <br>  the son of man will reward every man according to his works. <br>  How can jesus a man only reward any one in God's heaven. not even the angels can do that only God rewards people. <br>  <br>  <br>  Mat 22:41  While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, <br>  Mat 22:42  Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David. <br>  Mat 22:43  He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, <br>  Mat 22:44  The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? <br>  Mat 22:45  If David then call him, Lord, how is he his son? <br>  <br>  jesus ask them whose son is christ? they said king david.<br>  <br>  He said then how could king david then in the spirit call him lord saying the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand til i make thine enemies thy footstool. david in psalms 110:1 calls the christ his lord. If jesus was just a man, a descendant of david, david could not call the christ Lord. but he did saying Jehovah said to jehovah <br>  <br>  Mar 14:61  But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? <br>  Mar 14:62  And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. <br>  Mar 14:63  Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we any further witnesses? <br>  <br>  <br>  jesus tells the high priest I am the christ the annointed one from God. I will sit on the right hand of God on his throne.<br>  no human can sit on the throne of god ruling as god.<br>  <br>  so yes jesus did say he was god. <br>  He came to die on the cross not to let the people make him king at that time.|`|PS6Pjtndaa	LOL!<br>  <br>  I like to think that you'll be the keynote speaker at the next atheistic assembly.

What else is worship, but "beholding the glory" of God?<br>  <br>  (Sorry for the archaic language, but the American Standard Version was the Bible nearest my chair.)|`|sl7GhFoqaa	He said He was the Christ over and over again. <br>  Woman at the well, Peter, Pilot, and all the Pharisees.  <br>  Scripture for you to check:<br>  John 4:25,26 - claims to be the Messiah, the Christ<br>  John 6:38 - claims to have come FROM Heaven. (only God is from there)<br>  John 8:23 - Claims not to be of this world like human beings are. <br>  John 8:58 - Calls himself, "I AM (the name for God in the Old Testament)." and says that he existed before Abraham.<br>  John 9:37 - Claims to be the Son of God.<br>  John 10:30 - "I and the Father are ONE."<br>  John 12:45 - Says, "He who has seen Me, sees the One who sent Me. <br>  John 14:9 - Claims to be the exact representation of God the Father.<br>  John 20:28 - "My Lord and My GOD!!!"<br>  Mark 14:61,62 - High priest asking Him if He is the Christ.  His response, "I AM . . ."<br>  Mark 15:2 - Pilot asking Jesus if He is the King of the Jews (the messiah) His response, "It is as you say"<br>  Revelation 1:8 "I am the Alpha and Omega."<br>  There are many more, but would take forever for me to write them all.<br>   <br>  And the trinity isn't just one person, it's three distinct persons, all perfectly united in love, mind, and spirit, which makes them One in essence.   The trinity is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.  Each one has a different role, but they are all equally God.  The only thing we can come close to comparing such an amazing God of perfect unity, is when we get married, we become one!!!  That's God displaying on earth what's going on in heaven.  Remember everything in creation is a reflection of Him.  Three separate persons, as ONE.  Amazing God we have, i can't wait to be with Him.  <br>  <br>  But there is no verse where Jesus says what YOU want Him to say (as stated in your question), but He gives you an infinite pile of evidence.  So do with it as you please.|`|DB9QbZoQaa	If you have read the Bible and have not found what you ask here, than you do not want to see it.<br>  <br>  So these verses are for you.

I've studied this over and over and there is no trinity. Unlike many here, I have chosen not to waste my time believing in something that does not now nor ever will make sense. The Bible is clear: Jesus is the only begotten (created directly by God) Son of God! Christendom (the world empire of false religion) advanced this theory to try and justify other false beliefs. They have obviously been very good at this as this theory will not die! Compare this to the evolution theory, which won't die either. Many religious people have turned to evolution to explain what they can't explain otherwise. The Truth stands alone, but the lie begets the lie. I know this doesn't give you what you're looking for, but nothing ever will. There is no such Scripture!

VT03VUqNaa	Tongue-in-cheek is a term used to refer to humor in which a statement, or an entire fictional work, is not meant to be taken seriously, but its lack of seriousness is subtle. The origin of its usage comes from when Spanish minstrels would perform for various dukes in the 18th century; these dukes would silently chastise the silliness of the minstrel's performances by placing their tongue firmly to the side of their cheek. The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as "Ironic, slyly humorous; not meant to be taken seriously".|`|BW6sQQvAaa	for example, let's pretend that you are making fun of a handicap person.

And who's to say which one of us is the more innocent? It's a case by case basis. Does this mean the Christians who killed gays because it's "an abomination" will get their final judgment, too?

OfeCeEvqaa	You are sadly mistaken because the first five books of the Old Testament are the Torah, the Pentateuch, and it is upon Judaism that Christianity is based. Many people fail to realize that Jesus Christ is, was and always will be Jewish and it is through His unselfish sacrifice that we will spend eternity with Him That's just how much He loves us, 1 John 3:16 --- Hereby, perceive we the love of God that He laid down His life for us and so shall we lay down our lives for the brethren.<br>  <br>  As far as the Qu'ran, it is nothing more than a poorly plagiarized version of the Holy Bible that was written 700 years after the death, burial, Resurrection and Ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  gatita_63109|`|AA11923447	Of course, I'm not completely discrediting the Koran, or any other sacred text.

An old belief that the world was flat no longer holds any credit now that it was proven to be round with actual facts.<br>  The Qur'an for example was based from the Torah (admit it or not) and they came much later after the Christian Text which was also adopted from the Torah.<br>  Its accuracy can be measured on the peoples lives who were involved in that Books which their truth caters only to their history, culture and tradition. The Hindus and Buddhist and the other religions that were formed by breakaway groups have their own set of truths also.<br>  The only right  thing we can see about it is that God gave many roads for people to travel through their lives in search of their own journey to  their destiny. It only means wherever you belong, for as long as you do what is righteous and just with love, mercy and compassion to yourself and one another, your are in the right track.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Islam OLDER then Christianity??  try again..<br>  From Islam wiki page...<br>  "Muhammad began preaching Islam at Mecca before migrating to Medina, from where he united the tribes of Arabia into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632"<br>  <br>  Christianity began around 32AD, about 600 years BEFORE Islam. Catholicism was STILL follow the original practices and beliefs of Christians from the 1st century AD. <br>  TRUE, the Catholic church didn't get around to creating an official canon of the bible until around 397AD,  but their beliefs and practices go back even farther then that.<br>  <br>  <br>  NOW, generally speaking.. the people who bring up this type of argument,  by and large,  don't believe in any religion, and often times not even God.  They bring this up as a reason to NOT believe in something they already don't believe in. <br>  Generally Speaking that is.<br>  <br>  So, even though I'm Catholic,  I'll say you are better off believing in ANY religion, rather then no religion at all. I obviously believe Christianity makes the most sense, but I acknowledge that any belief in God is better then no belief. <br>  <br>  <br>  So, it is OK to question that Christianity is the ONE true way, given the fact that there are other religions.  However,  JUST don't fall into the trap of concluding that THEREFORE ALL RELIGIONS are wrong and therefore there is no NEED for religion. OR that EVERYTHING is subjective. <br>  <br>  To question what is subjective and what is not is QUITE different from merely concluding there is nothing substantial or true.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	The copyists were extremely meticulous in their work. For example, early Hebrew copyists even counted every letter in the Torah to prevent mistakes from creeping in when manuscripts were being copied. Each time they copied one, they would count the letters in their copy and compare it with that of the original to make sure that both were identical. It is reported that they counted 815,140 individual letters in the Hebrew Scriptures. In the first century?C.E., Jesus and his followers quoted from the copies on hand without expressing any doubt at all concerning the accuracy of the text. (Luke 4:16-21; Acts 17:1-3) The precision of those who have copied the Scriptures over the centuries has contributed toward an accurate transmission of the text down to our day.<br>  <br>  5 By studying the thousands of manuscripts extant in our time and comparing them with one another, we can see that the original text has been accurately passed down to us. Existing today are some 6,000 manuscripts of either all the Hebrew Scriptures or parts thereof. Muhammad, however, came with no supernatural proofs of his divine commission. Time and again his critics complained of this and repeatedly he told them that his work was not that of producing signs but merely to preach, and that his lack of signs was for the purpose of testing their faith. But what is faith without proof? Anyone could claim to be sent of God. Moses and Christ proved it by the performance of many miracles, but where were Muhammad’s miracles? He confessed in the Quran to having none.—See Suras 2:118; 10:38; 11:13; 6:109, Ali.Since both the former or the canceled verse and the one that came later and does the canceling or abrogating remain in the Quran it can easily be seen how there would be contradictions in the Quran. Especially is this possible in view of the fact that it is not at all certain when each sura was “revealed,” and therefore it cannot always be determined which is the abrogating and which the abrogated text.<br>  <br>  Some modern Muslims object to all this and claim that what Muhammad referred to as being canceled or abrogated was not anything that appeared in the Quran but only such things as may have been written in the Tourat or the Hebrew Scriptures or in the Injil or the Gospel. However, to make such a claim is to deny the testimony of history, which shows why Muhammad was accused of being a forger, as well as to ignore the context in the Quran. Such a claim is made only by some modern Muslims, for the testimony of the most noted Muslim scribes and imams of times past is to the effect that both the texts canceled and those doing the canceling are in the Quran. Says the noted Razi, on Sura 16:99, 100: “The The Bible presents no such difficulties. When properly understood, it is found to be harmonious from cover to cover. This is what we should expect in view of its claim to be the Word of Jehovah God. Generally those who claim that the Bible contradicts itself do so only because they fail to distinguish between literal and symbolical language, or because they fail to take into consideration the context, or because they are lacking in objectivity.Modern Muslims claim that the Quran teaches freedom of religion and advocates only defensive warfare, but can such expressions as “kill those that join other gods to God wherever you find them,” “but if they convert .?.?. let them go their way,” and “kill them .?.?. until the temptation stops” be construed as either defensive warfare or permitting freedom of religion? The very Arabic word jihad disproves such a contention, for it means, “A religious war against infidels or Mohammedan heretics.” (Webster) Many, many Muslims were slain by other Muslims because of religious differences. Certainly that does not spell out freedom of religion.|`|0Y6CqSliaa	Okay, first of all i respect all religions (or lack of religion).<br>  If you have ever read the Bible it says that Jews are the chosen race...<br>  Islam was only a religion hundreds of years after Christianity was started.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	You don't know the meaning of accurate.|`|pxgIsS0Maa	Did you hear that the big "R" that the ANT carried?|`|RermzbWgaa	The Torah is in the Christian Bible.

The Catholic Church teaches: <br>  <br>  + About Judaism: "The Jewish faith, unlike other non-Christian religions, is already a response to God's revelation in the Old Covenant. To the Jews "belong the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ"; "for the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.<br>  <br>  + About Islam: The plan of salvation also includes those who acknowledge the Creator, in the first place amongst whom are the Muslims; these profess to hold the faith of Abraham, and together with us they adore the one, merciful God, mankind's judge on the last day.<br>  <br>  + About other non-Christian religions: All nations form but one community. This is so because all stem from the one stock which God created to people the entire earth, and also because all share a common destiny, namely God. His providence, evident goodness, and saving designs extend to all against the day when the elect are gathered together in the holy city.<br>  <br>  For more information, see:<br>  ?

But like I said, not everyone in the 50's was a crazy racist, not everyone in the 10/20's was in the Klan and even in slavery days there were the many Quaker white people who helped the slaves run away from their owners and they also loved and respected the Indians.<br>  <br>  But look at all the people who HATE things like Affirmative action and Black History Month and everything black people do, if they had a bigger voice, some people might want black people and other minorities to go back to having nothing.|`|pfke6Jieaa	sure why not. its all about the way people perceive things more than it has to do with the president. i think some people just get an ego boost from having someone from their race in polotics. those are the people who are ruining it for everyone.|`|c4OEuojoaa	idk i think it has definately come a long way but i dont know if anyone or anything can ever break that. it can get a lot better but never perfect. i wish it did.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	I believe that racism is evolving.

cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	the  morals of  sexuality  of  the  religious  groups  typically  dont  apply  to gays  since  that  is  where  we  part ways. <br>  <br>   the  religious  right  has  from  one  side  of  their  mouth  condemned  us  as  promiscuous  by  talking  about  sex outside  marriage, and  from  the  other side of  their  mouth  they  say everything  to stop  us  from  ever  getting  married.<br>  <br>   it  seems  they  want  us  on  the  outside.<br>  <br>  but marriage  is  a  legal  arrangement. it  can be  a  blessing  as  well  but  that  is  alwaya a separate  matter.<br>  <br>  to  determine  whether  legal  or  religious considerations  take  precedence  consider that  the  church needs  government  approval  in the  form  of  a license to  conduct  the  wedding cermony  whereas the  govenment  does  not  require  the  church's  permission  <br>  <br>  SO THERE.|`|U5A8JQ1paa	actually i'm still waiting for the right girl.  when i was with men i just slept with practically anyone who wanted to sleep with me, so now I'm changing and I am waiting for the right girl.  which is good because it helps me weed out the ones that are only looking for sex|`|0FXVTZf7aa	Try the website below, it shows you the pro-premarital sex stuff in the Bible that your church will never tell you about.

ridu0Rtwaa	This discovery is important for the evidence that humans walked upright on two feet.<br>  <br>  Our early human ancestors developed the ability to walk upright while living in trees rather than on open land as it was believed many years ago.<br>  <br>  Scientists believe the common ancestors of all great apes - including humans - developed the ability to move upright so they could reach fruit on small branches and move between trees. <br>  <br>  This would shift the date at which the early apes first became bipedal from between 4.5 million and eight million years ago under the current view to at least 17 million years ago.<br>  <br>  But as fossil records like this discovery are so rare it still makes it very important as it proves conclusively that the walk was on two feet and not knuckle dragging like chimps and apes!!|`|czf6uhIraa	*Me being a Creationist*<br>  ....<br>  *puts fingers in ears*<br>  "LALALALALA It's not real and I'm not listening!!LALALA!"<br>  <br>  But seriously, interesting discovery.|`|EMVT2xjEaa	Cool discovery|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Nice print, crappy photo, wish I could see more of it...|`|hQDapmICaa	and you call us fools for believing in a footprint that is only 2000 years old.|`|AA11490975	Wow!

UVnr7wrmaa	We have a lot of photos hanging on the walls in our house, and every morning when we wake up the frames are always wonky. We fix them up, but then the next day they're just the same as they the day before.<br>  <br>  We spoke to a psychic and she told us that it was a relative of ours (my uncle) who died in '06 trying to make contact with us. And I don't know whether to believe it or not.... but it does make sense. <br>  <br>  And when I was really little, I used to have continuous dreams that my mother would turn into a giant cockroach and then eat me. And now I'm<br>  scared of cockroaches a great deal. I scream at the sight of one. My mother thinks it's weird, and thinks I overreact, but for some reason, I'm just sooooo scared of them :( I've got a theory that my dreams when I was little triggered my fear, but as I said, I'm unsure.

P8dIznazaa	They should be about even, except for a couple things.  French pronunciation is significantly harder (for most Americans) than Spanish, and it's very important to pronounce the language right.  A heavy American accent grates real badly on the ear of a native speaker or someone who's learned the language well--I think that's also why so many Americans who go to Paris get treated so rudely.  (A heavy American accent in Spanish is pretty awful-sounding too, but not as bad as in French.)<br>  <br>  The other thing that makes French harder is its grammar.  When you get into it kind of deeply (say, past 2nd or 3rd year), learning the grammar rules becomes important.  In Spanish, all the grammatical rules are regular--you learn a rule, you're good to go.  But French grammar is about as complex and full of exceptions as English is.  You'll learn a rule, then learn a whole bunch of exceptions, then the book will quiz you on rules it didn't teach! (if your book is anything like what I used in college).<br>  <br>  That said, you're probably not looking at doing the whole "four years of language in high school and continue in college" thing, so the grammar difference probably won't be much of an issue for you.<br>  <br>  Practically speaking, you could ask yourself where you want to be able to use the language.  If you don't expect to leave the country, or plan to travel in Mexico or Latin America, Spanish is your best bet.  If you'd like to get by someday in Europe or parts of Africa or Asia, French is a no-brainer in a choice between the two.|`|1d3be905c594dfa5842eec70072bbee6aa	It depends on where you live<br>  <br>  Like if you live in Northern/North Eastern/North Western United States you should learn french because you're closer to the canadian border<br>  <br>  But you live in South/Western United States, you should learn spanish because you're closer to the mexican border<br>  <br>  <br>  I live in the South Western i chosed Spanish, because more spanish speakers than french speakers live in California.<br>  <br>  It all depends o where you live. Learning a secondlanguagee will help you have a better change to getting a good-paying job where you live!|`|BQ0y50Nvaa	If you like French better, you've answered the question. Learning a language requires a lot of motivation and keeping it is difficult, so pick the one you like.|`|zjxr6fRsaa	spanish.|`|NO9xC9aaaa	Spanish is the fourth most widely spoken language in the world. Only English (508 million speakers), Hindi (497 million speakers), and Mandarin Chinese (1 billion+ speakers) speakers outnumber Spanish speakers. Spanish is also the third most widely used language on the Internet.<br>  <br>  To sum things up, if you like the idea of being able to communicate with the 392 million people who speak Spanish on this planet, or if you're simply a practical person who thinks that the purpose of learning a language is to be able to understand more people, then Spanish is certainly a good option.|`|AA11763958	Where do you live?<br>  <br>  Are you going to be able to practice it?

If you are American, you will run into a lot more Spanish speakers than French speakers. Spanish is also easier. Written French includes letters which are not pronounced.

LQ7rROMSaa	I've had many experiences with the paranormal. But I'll just say one story for now. My great-aunt, in Croatia, died several years ago. Her daughter, my cousin, left the house just the way it was. She went in there to flower the plants or to make sure no one broke in or anything, but other than that, everything was pretty much the same. I went with my grandma to Croatia in 2004, and we decided to go to my great-aunt's house with my cousin. We were there in the morning; the sun was shining SO bright. We thought we heard a knock in my great-aunt's room, but we played it off, saying it could have been a cat or just a neighbor. We came back during the night, only to find the light was on in my great-aunt's room, her door was open, and a person's imprint on the bed. Now, no one has the key to my great-aunt;s house but us. And it was clear no one broke in, because there was a security system. We tried re-tracing our steps this morning, thinking if one of us turned on the light by accident. But we were in the other room the whole time, so it was clearly impossible. My grandma pointed to the bed; the body imprint on the mattress clearly matched the way my great-aunt slept. Her favorite pajama was out on a chair. We couldn't think of an explaination. We were quite bewildered. The next day my younger cousin told us that she drove past the house with her friends. Her one friend pointed out that it looked like someone was inside, changing, exactly in our great-aunt's room. She thought it was one of us; but it wasn't. She passed the house at 7:30. We didn't come until 8:30-9:00. We think it was our great-aunt, who must have came back because she was so happy that my grandma and I came to Europe; possibly her soul wanted to pretend she was alive so it could be like old times.|`|YAdr4Jgsaa	yeah i have. My uncle was killed when i was about 7 years old and i saw his ghost when i was about 16...i knew it was him because he was wearing his police uniform with his hat. He just smiled at me until i turned on the light and he disappeared. I've seen other ghosts too in my house but i don't know who they are...one was a little boy and i've also seen a little girl too...it's really strange & it still kinda freaks me out lol|`|iZYw500Vaa	Really scary things::::<br>  <br>  About 2-3 years ago me and my friends played a game similar to the wiji board but on a lap top... the game was based on asking a spirit a question and he would answer back On the computer as in a chat..At first i thought it was fake but then when i checked the laptop, it had no connection to the internet and there was no way He could answer all this questions right i got really scared!!.. I remember asking questions like What did i do yesterday? or What color shirt am i wearing? or Name all the people in the room and Do aliens exist and what's my ex's name? Were is she? .. I couldnt believe my eyes whe he gave us all those answers .. I couldnt sleep that night!<br>  <br>  Also when i was little i came home at midnight one time it was all dark and no one was home, all the lights were off all of a sudden i see the keyboard of the computer being pushed as if someone was typing and then i hear the toilet flush!!!<br>  I ran out the house terrified...I couldn't sleep that night either!.<br>  <br>  Also in the same house i would sometimes hear voices or just noises at night.. now that i think about it i think the house was haunted..|`|r0FFRRcAaa	yeah i was in at the movies whit my friends and we were watching twilight since it stared i had this chill and stared to breath faster i thought it was gana go away but it didnt it lasted for a week and i still feel so i decide to do some research and ever sice im been into vampire i keep having this feeling its hard to explain but its scary at the same time|`|JWjq5iaXaa	Well, besides seeing some ghosts that I don't really remember much about, this is the most recent thing.<br>  <br>  Actually, this isn't really a weird thing, it just scared the crap out of me.<br>  <br>  I got my wisdom teeth pulled out this morning (major ouch), because for weeks I've been feeling intense pain. So, I've been on heavy medication. For some reason, most likely the medication, I've actually been dilusional. <br>  <br>  Outside my second period class, I swear I saw zombies. They were just outside the window. I nearly screamed and sat their breathing heavily in complete shock. But, knowing I'd been dilusional lately, I thought, "hey wait, if there were zombies, I could hear them!" so then I realized they weren't there. A blessing and a shame (z-day would be cool!), but my spanish teacher asked if everything was alright. I was kind of embarrased, but it was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life.|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	Eh, it's somewhat of a ghost-like experience, my only one. <br>  I was at my Dad's house. My younger self and my nephews from around the same age were home alone and playing games. I got frustrated because one wouldn't follow the rules and leaned against the stove, arms crossed. Then, from out of the hallway, a knife emerged in a spinning circular moving toward me. It landed sideways on my crossed arm, its sharp end pointing toward my heart. We were too young to be frightened, so we started to look in the hall and the hall's room. Of course, we found nothing. And of course, no one believed us.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	I have had many experiences for I have a guardian Angle, that has protected me all my life so far. I have had many Miracles happen to me ,for I know that God is real with out a doubt .The world will see many Miracles coming soon for we are living in the last days for there is less then 27 years before the second coming of Jesus Christ. But there will also be great suffering upon this earth to the unbelievers of the true and living God .I will say this story make it short .was at a river with friends like 4 of them, we had a air boat and we decided to go with the flow of the river. As we went we came to a water fall about a 15 feet drop as we got closer, we all said lets go over we never had life jackets on . I was sitting on the back and as we got right up to go over. Well the next thing I know it was all like a blink of an eye, is that I am sitting with my legs crossed looking around and seeing all of these beautiful colored rocks.  I am asking my self were am I am I dead. I could not recognize the place were I was. I then could here water behind me. As I slowly turned I could see a water like funnel behind me then I realized were I am I was sitting under  water it scared me so I pushed my self up and pop up on the surfaces. I then could see were ever one else was. I look up and seen a guy standing on the hill above looking at me .He was probably wondering were I dispersed to. I swam and caught up to my one friend that was with the air boat and jumped on, while ever one else went to shore. As I sat in the boat going the rest of the way down a rock hit my foot and that hurt. I thought to my self I just went over a water fall and nothing happened to me and here a little rock hurts my foot how funny was that. I then thought how was it possible that I was able to be under water with out having the desire to want to breath ,or how was it possible that I was able to see so clearly under water, all the beautiful colored rocks. I snorkel a lot and I know that you can not see under water like that, unless you have goggles on.. I then thought I wished that I did not get scared being under water for I could of stayed there much longer. This was a Miracle, and I experienced many Miracles like this in my life. In different situations God is real as real as you and I are, and he dose protect his children|`|EZZCs6OFaa	everyone has a ghost story most made up <br>  but all of them weird i have heaps about my friends who live in England...<br>  <br>  My friend's mum was lying in bed when she looked into the mirror that shows what's in the hall and she saw a little boy run past and afterwards a woman grabbed the little boy and just stared at my friends mum so she woke up her husband and he couldn't see anything and they checked the whole house with baseball bats|`|zEoRcL91aa	I saw ghosts as a kid - one was of a little black scottie dog and the other, was this head just suspended in the air.<br>  <br>  About 2 years ago, I was asleep lying head to toe with my husband and I felt this arm across my stomach.

BTWBLd23aa	No, we Koreans never think the Western people, including the British, are dirty or strange.<br>  As you said in your question, it's not easy to see coupes of Korean guys and Western girls in the street, while we can easily seen the other way round like Korean girls and Western guys, who are usually English teachers, foreign students or American soldiers.<br>  We Korean guys tend to regard Western girls as more beautiful and attractive than Korean girls.<br>  But we think the Western girls are not interested in Asian guys.<br>  Maybe it's because we are usually not as tall or attractive as Western guys. Korean guys also envy the Western guys their long legs, nice noses and big, round eyes.<br>  <br>  And another reason is that it hasn't been a very long time since we Koreans opened the door to the Western countries, in comparison with our neigbour country, Japan.<br>  So, we are not familiar with foreigners, not because we don't like or welcome them.<br>  I was also a bit surprised to see tall, blonded American missionaries, when I was very young.<br>  Now I live in Seoul, the capital city, where we can easily see lots and lots of foreiners from various ethnic groups.<br>  And it's true that we still have difficulty in marrying someone of different race.<br>  We normally ask for our parents' permission, before we get married.<br>  Of course, some couples are ready to leave their family, when their parents are opposed to their marriage, because the other is not as rich or well-educated as their own son or daughter , and so on.<br>  Anyway, it matters most whether they sincerely love each other.<br>  <br>  So, please do not think that we Koreans dislike Western people.|`|ct6UuNfAaa	Korea has a history of being a "clan" oriented society.  Pair that with a strong "confucian" background and you can understand why they were called the "Hermit Kingdom" in the past.  If you are not a part of the group in Korea, you are really not important to anyone.  The real key to getting along in Korea, outside areas like Song-tan or Itewan, is to join a group.  <br>  <br>  Now, the problem with this is that there is no casual dating in Korea.  Watch yourself!  Korean girls who date foreigners are not looked upon politely by most Koreans.  Korea is a country where prejudice is allowed.  Go to the entertainment districts outside of Itewan and you will find signs on the front doors, "No foreigners Allowed."  Go to Itewan and the famous "Nashville Pub and Restaurant"  You will see a sign on the door, "No Koreans allowed unless accompanied by a foreigner."  Pick up the local newspapers and read about the treatement of half-blood children in the local schools.  You will find all sorts of prejudice alive and well in the culture. (Here is a little aside:  During the IMF Loan, I was working in the schools.  The female teachers were given pay cuts and told to clean up the school in the evenings so that the school did not have to continue paying for a cleaning crew.  The male teachers continued on as usual.  When I asked about the reasoning, I was told that the female teachers were married so their incomes were "extra income" for their families.  "True Story."  Many of the private schools, "Hog-wons" followed suit, reducing pay to female employees.)  <br>  <br>  With that said, these values are less noticeable in the younger generations.  But do not be surprised if your efforts to become Truly involved in the culture fall just a bit short.  You will always be a foreigner in a very homo genetic culture.  <br>  <br>  The very best way to join in the culture is to join some sort of special interest group.  The best way to meet women is to go to the Foreigner areas, Itewan or Song-tan and meet women who have had exposure to Westerners and western ideas.  If you meet a lady and date her inside the Korean culture, it will be regarded quite seriously by the Koreans around you and by the girl.|`|wqchA8B7aa	There's plenty of mixed race couples with an Asian man and a woman of European descent.

7gH7sgi6aa	In all honesty unless this is a very close family friend your parent should not have sent an EM to this person, if anything, it probably scared the person off.  If I were you I would send an EM apologizing for your parents "crazy" and just say your were sorry.  Tell them that you mentioned to your parent that you did like him but they had no business EMing him telling him that.  Give him plenty of time to digest it and then if he doesn't EM you back in a few days then try to approach him and talk to him.  If he doesn't give you the feeling he wants to talk the he probably isn't into you.  Good luck.

Then you'll see that you should be even more afraid than you are.<br>  <br>  The Republic, Book One<br>  "For let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before; the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he is tormented with the thought that they may be true: either from the weakness of age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that other place, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to others. And when he finds that the sum of his transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings.

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

We all know that in today's time people hardly hesitate to do anything wrong.|`|kmTnIuL2aa	Not as an absolute truth. Schools are based on teaching fact. Fact is something that has to be proven. Religion is pretty much never proven, so it can't be considered undeniable fact. It would be considered offensive to anyone who doesn't share that belief, and it would violate the establishment clause of the constitution. Because schools are government funded, schools can't favor any one religion over another, which your recommendation would be doing.|`|9HeeXuGuaa	The fear and love of God are equally important, and should be taught to the young.

It means to seek to do what is right and to turn away from those things that are wrong.

The translation would better be given as the "awe for God".  God wants our love, not our fear.  He doesnt' want a bunch of beaten and abused puppies that cower in fear of being beaten again.  That being said...I believe that morals and discipline need to be taught at home.  Unfortunately, in many cases it isn't.  But we can't necessarily call these children "juvenile delinquents".

This will never resolve the damage from the past by the Christian community [I'm a Christian], from Christians preaching "going to hell", with over tones and self-righteous attitudes of holier-than-thou blended in.  "Fear" as used in the Holy Bible means an awesome respect - not a dreaded terror !  Jesus was not unapproachable and did not expect people to be better than He was.  Jesus reached out to people - except the "religious" who hated Him and had Him eventually murdered.  Similarly today, the Christian [religious] community has murdered Jesus by there "religious" approach to introducing Him to the world.  Jesus LOVED others - He served the needs of others and Christians are to pass that love along to others in the world.  It is by those "jungle laws" [human nature] that people survive (God gave us that nature) re: All God Created, from the Beginning HE [God] called "good" (see Book of Genesis ).  Only Christians involved within a sound relationship with God, through the grace, love and faith of Jesus can work within us to give us the mind-set necessary to reach out to others, so Jesus can work in the hearts [minds] of the unconverted [non-believers].

I think it is OK to force the general population to contribute to the education of children via tax dollars,   but the actual schools in which children get educated should be up to the children and their parents.   Parents should be able to use publicly raised school tax dollars to send their children to religious or other private schools if they so choose.

(regarding Katrina) Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response.  She said, 'I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we've been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives.  And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out.  How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?' <br>  <br>  <br>  In light of recent events... terrorists attack, school shootings, etc.  I think it started when Madeleine Murray O'Hare (she was murdered, her body found a few years ago) complained she didn't want prayer in our schools, and we said OK.  Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school.  The Bible says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbor as yourself.  And we said OK.<br>  <br>  Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn't spank our children when they misbehave because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr Spock's son committed suicide).  We said an expert should know what he's talking about.  And we said OK.<br>  <br>  Now we're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don't know right from wrong, and why it doesn't bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.<br>  <br>  Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out.  I think it has a great deal to do with 'WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.'<br>  <br>  Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell  Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says.  Funny how you can send 'jokes' through e-mail and they spread like wildfire but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing.  Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace.<br>  <br>  We asked him to leave us alone, and now complain cause he did.. Sigh.. <br>  <br>  Now onto the Fear part. God does not want us to fear him.

Or, if they couldn't fix it, replace it? <br>  <br>  (There's plenty in the Talmud about that as well, but I'm assuming from your use of the word "scripture" that you're a Christian and wanted something from the Christian Bible.)|`|AA11690436	Even as the good potter fixes broken dinnerware, thou shalt fix thy cats and dogs so that there will not be a profusion of unwanted kittens and puppies who must suffer for your arrogance."<br>  <br>  Petalonians, 3:17|`|AA10028372	Matthew 7:12 is the best advice, but like a sign I saw once stated "We can weld anything but a broken heart" points out the sadness of dashed hopes and a whole lot more that only time and willingness to move-on can eventually dull the pain somewhat.
WL7nKDplaa	If you're asking me about whether or not I believe in fate, yes and no. I do think that their is a plan for us in our life, but I think we do have the power to change. Now if someone gets a disease such as cancer, if they can't treat it, they can't treat it. That is the way it is meant to be.

At times you are extroverted, affable, sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary and reserved. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. You pride yourself on being an independent thinker and do not accept others' opinions without satisfactory proof. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety, and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. Disciplined and controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the inside.<br>  <br>      Your sexual adjustment has presented some problems for you. While you have some personality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. You have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned to your advantage. You have a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a strong need for other people to like you and for them to admire you.|`|6JnAOYCYaa	Hello Michael<br>  <br>  As a psychic myself I can say that there may well be a few scammers out there - all areas of life have them.

I'm not the one to call someone ignorant, but there is a big difference in "not knowing" and true racism.   <br>  <br>  You are not a bad person.  Try to change your friends in a respectful way.

If you feel that you are different and you say that you don't behave like you used to then why are you questioning yourself? It sounds like you are not sure or if you have some sort of guilt. However, I am not one to judge.  Hell I am guilty of making "racist" comments myself and I definitely am not a racist. If you were saying and/or doing things that were wrong and racist and you feel or felt bad about it, but you said you have changed then that is all that matters. However, I also must say that being racist or negative is never right, whether you are saying it to someone's face or behind their back. As a matter of fact, saying it behind their back is even worse because that means that you are a closet racist and that is not cool. Again, change is always good and hopefully you have changed and will always remember how you are feeling about it at this point.|`|F08PwBhgaa	No, you are not a bad person. You were brought up around a racist environment, and it's normal for people to follow the crowd especially when everyone around you is doing the same thing. If anything, you are an especially good person to realize that what you have been doing is wrong and making the effort to change. Everybody does things that they're not proud of, and anyone can redeem themselves and it looks like you're ready to do that. Be proud of yourself.
aWcD7Ou5aa	My biggest piece of advice is firstly, don't run away from your problems.  Wherever you run, you still take yourself with you.  Figure out what options you have.  What do you know how to do?  If you can wash dishes, go be the best damn dish washer in town!  It's going to be hard with a criminal record, but, can you go to an employment agency?  They are great at finding people work, but you have to be drug tested.  You need to stay away from all of your old friends and places you used to hang out, you'll only go backwards that way.  You need to pound the pavement from sun-up to sundown and take any job you can get right now, that will start you on the right track.  A job is the most important thing because a little money is better than none.  No, that 'stimulus package' is just so the rich CEO's can get as much money as they can shove in their pockets before our economy collapses.  The only one you can depend on is you.  You're going to have to pull yourself out of this slowly by the sweat of your brow brother.  Don't try to solve every problem you have right now, take one at a time (job first), from their, it will get easier.  If your girlfriend works, two incomes will help, if she doesn't, she needs to go get a job also.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	seek out ones from the Salvation Army... be honest with them... and they may be able to help... in more than just the worldly needs as well... but you got to earn their trust... put in some time helping in the store and other needs... can you do work like Mr. fix-it things to help others... offer to do what you can...|`|YRYyZQoDaa	Their is not stimulus plan to really help  people like us.  I have been kicked while I have been down and its not a pretty site, but you pick yourself up and make things happen.  Stealing, dealing drugs are no way to make money and look your daughter in the face each day.  Call the people you owe money too tell them your payment will be late, pay the interest for a few months, take any and all jobs offer if they are for one day only.  Take pride in yourself, pride in your child and girlfriend stay honest and things will work out.|`|AA10895799	I'm glad U don't want to go THAT way any longer.  Try Jesus.  Find your spiritual base,  and get acquainted with yourself while U are on "vacation".  Just think of it as yr being on a vacation.  It's temporary.  U do have the love and support of your most important people in your life and many people don't  have that support.  Be thankful for what U have and get sharp about the opportunities.  See what is available to U even if it is a low-paying job.  if it brings a little money in a week, do that job and look for another at the same time. When U fins another, better job, gibe a proper notice and don't leave them stranded without help.  If U do not have felonies, look up school maintenance jobs.  Some states have job training for jobless people.  Being on vacation, U can do this.  Train for a health care job that is not dependent on the economy.
dfjIBHe3aa	Props to Diet Pepsi Max Fan.  There is really not a lot of money in UFO hunting.  Most of them are published authors -- and publicizing that is where most of the money comes from.

i5MiFhMyaa	People want you to believe that there is a devil waiting for you to go to hell. This was, and continues to be a way to plant fear in people and to control them.<br>  <br>  It begs the question. Is someone good because they fear hell and eternal damnation, or because of the kindness of their hearts.<br>  <br>  Also once cannot help but ask about the paradox. If there is a devil and the devil is evil, why would an evil person be punished in hell for doing the devil's work. Shouldn't this evil person be rewarded by the devil (who is also evil)? You would think that a good person that happens to get to hell somehow is the one that the devil would despise.|`|39rXZUeQaa	He just rules over Hell.

The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).

Therefore, he wants humans to lose their lives as well. As far as hell goes, nowhere in the Bible does it say wicked humans go to hell. This is an untruth taught in the church as passed down for centuries. Revelation speaks of a lake of fire, but this is symbolic of a second death, which is death without a resurrection. In fact, the scriptures speak of hurling death and Hades into the lake of fire. If this lake was a literal hell, how could death and the common grave be hurled into it? Think about it..... (rev 20:14.15)|`|PdDbzxvzaa	I'm a buddhist and we have Mara the tempter or life killer. Anyway the devil suffers a lot just be compassionate  to him.

He hates when anyone does YHWH/Jehovah's will. There is no real place called hell. Hell is a mistranslation of Hebrew and Greek words that mean death and the grave.

They are awaiting the ressurection on the last day of this world that has been ruled by ha satan and the imperfect offspring of Adam and Eve.<br>  <br>  The good news of the Kingdom that Yhshua/Jesus preached is that when YHWH/Jehovah ends this world, He will then establish His perfect Kingdom "on earth as it is in heaven" for all those who do His will and follow the example of His son.<br>  <br>  For very direct and clear Bible Scriptures that support what I wrote above, please read Job 1:7-12; Genesis 3:19; Ecclesiastes 3:19, 20; Ecclesiastes 9:5; Psalm 13:3; Psalm 146:4; John 11:11-14; John 5:28-30; Matthew 7:21-23; Revelation 21:1-5; 2 Peter 3:13; Psalm 37:10, 11; Matthew 5:5|`|gC5eFMyTaa	To Prove to Almighty GOD, That HE should Be in Heaven, because HE can control us.

I was right, and you were wrong, because your pathetic creatures choose me over you! Mwahahahahaha!"|`|a7fc3089d9e7ba174faf16c6aa239694aa	The Bible only gives us some vague answers to this question.  I believe it has to do with Satan hating God for creating humans and the future plans God has for them.  The Bible states that humans will judge the angels one day.  I believe that Satan had too much pride to allow a human to judge him and therefore he rebelled.

qbQT7oMtaa	I tried rosetta stone for Spanish. It does not have any translation, grammar or conjugation instructions so it will be very hard to go beyond the basics with it. It is good for the basics as it is pure memorization. There is no way to be fluent with it. Their program is based on the same thing where you see these 4 pictures over and over again. I was disappointed especially for the price I paid. If you want to read Jules Verne, you would need to know much more than basic sentences and words.<br>  <br>  My college uses tell me more. My goal was to become fluent so it was perfect for me and I bought their individual version. It has a lot of different activities: picture/word association, videos, dialogues,..., includes also grammar and conjugation. It has also more content than any other language software. Their speech recognition is great so you can have a dialogue with the computer. You can contact them to get a free demo <a href="http://www.tellmemore.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tellmemore.com</a> and also ask for a Rosetta Stone demo to compare, visit independent reviews websites(About.com, ...). <br>  <br>  The best way to learn a language would be through immersion, visiting these countries. Learning a language will require some time. In addition to software, you can have books which are useful as well. Audio CDs like Pimsleur for instance might help you out but you cannot get any feedback on your pronunciation so I did not like it so much|`|6CAsx3jaaa	my library had it and i used it for spanish and russian. it does work . i would recommend checking your library for their language programs . these will be free. if your learning spanish or french i think you can watch dvds  with the language tracks too . for other languages i think it works. i think the nice thing about it is that you learn  how it sounds and what the written language looks like.  ive heard of livemocha  which is a website that lets you speak to speakers of different languages  but havent tried it. i would also say that the barons company makes some great language books particularly their 501 verbs books which are in lots of languages.|`|w3plOs6uaa	i have never tried it. u should save ur money and go to www.livemocha.com for free

In dreams, symbolism is a huge factor...<br>  <br>  The airplane crash symbolizes a bad event or a tragedy.<br>  <br>  The mountains being near to your house symbolizes a sense of events close to you.<br>  <br>  The people on the floor with blood can symbolize a tragedy, a death, or a repressed bad memory.<br>  <br>  All the family members don't represent anything but themselves.<br>  <br>  <br>  Piecing together these symbols, it's pretty obvious that you are worried about your family enduring a tragedy... whether it's a death in the family or just something bad enough to make you worry. <br>  <br>  Now, The dream isn't necessarily telling you that this is going to happen, but it IS telling you that it isn't ready for something bad like this. So there is nothing really to worry about, and if you continue to freak out, you should talk to your parents or see a therapist. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped clear things up :)|`|EZZCs6OFaa	Your mum dieing means that she will be healthy and safe however your aunty may be in trouble<br>  and  if there was a crow inside the box someone inside the box will experience either death depression or sicknees but if it was outside the box then it will be either you your cousin or aunty who will become sick or depressed|`|NCWWRfUcaa	google it

My boyfriend grew up in a Christian household, where he was spanked. What did he learn? To avoid getting in trouble and hide his actions from his parents. I grew up in a Christian household where I was not spanked (my mother thinks parents who spank their children are awful, she used to approach parents in public and tell them this). What have I learned? I am always responsible for my actions and I don't hide things from my parents. If I do something wrong, I own up to it. Spanking causes serious psychological damage on children, shame on you!|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Unfortunately the law in many countries has prohibited spanking the child. Its long hand even reaches into our homes looking for parents who chide their naughty children.<br>  <br>  I believe that children need firm boundaries, and if they cross it they will get punished. And then carry out that punishment exactly as you told them, do not waiver but carry it out to the letter.<br>  <br>  A good spanking on the behind normally sends a message up to the brain that what they did will cause them pain. So the next time they think of crossing those boundaries they will remember the pain they were afflicted with the last time.<br>  <br>  Jeez I grew up like that, and including all my siblings. Of course the girls were handled differently, but they got punished nevertheless. And today all 9 of us are good law abiding citizens, and including our children.

Now this spanking did us the world of good, (not cayenne pepper for goodness sake)  but it was always followed up with love and an explanation that we deserved this, and we must never do it again.|`|xDOp37T7aa	Yes, snorting cayenne pepper or tabasco is a perfectly reasonable punishment. Try both concurrently for extra 'positive' reinforcement, one in each nostril, while spanking them softly. No need to bruise them.

I have a good job in engineering, so I know something about science.)<br>  <br>  No, that is not good punishment.  What is the purpose of your punishment?  Are you trying to get them to show you the behavior that you want, or are you trying to instill in them a desire to be kind and on time because "they" want to?<br>  <br>  Your "instilling respect" is going a long ways to raising a generation  that questions the validity of your belief in God.  Your 6 year old twins are too young to usurp your authority.  Your 12 year old boy and your 13 year old girl are 1-2 years away from giving you a piece of her mind and going into rebellion (14 is the magic age when they stop believing in the "because I told you so" answer of a parent and start questioning your beliefs and start determining their own.).  Also I'm surprised that your 17 year old hasn't rebelled already.   <br>  <br>  I'm not sure you can bring the "Law of God" into your rules.  Don't pass on your family rules as those from God.  You are coupling your rules and saying God wants them to follow them (honor father and mother, don't swear, etc.), then you use cruel techniques to try to force them to follow.  Love brings respect, Force brings rebellion.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I do believe in "train up a child in the way he should go", however abuse is not training.  Have you tried taking way priviledges?  For the younger ones, a timeout?  Maybe even going to bed early, less TV or computer time, etc?<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that you should allow them to break curfew or mouth off, however you may want to review your methods.  There are many other alternatives that are better.  Take a parenting class.
QOxtCMEAaa	God has not or will never leave your hand.|`|ksXayEUoaa	Maybe it's you that have left God. He's not a quitter so don't blame Him.<br>  <br>  It's normal to think that since things aren't going our way that God just isn't listening. But in fact He just has bigger plans for us. And, sometimes it takes us just following His will for us to help see the bigger picture.<br>  <br>  God doesn't waste pain. It's supposed to be a learning experience. It allows people an excuse to show their love and support.<br>  <br>  Try spending this time to get to know Him better. Try reading the New Testament.

TO4bRflyaa	Sadly, most westerners have a bad impression of India. The truth is that India is probably the most diverse country in the world.<br>  <br>  You will find poverty, slums, richest men, high-rise buildings, clubs, the best schools, small and big companies, the best cinemaplexes, the best wildlife parks, beautiful beaches, greenery, heavy traffic and to a much lesser extent, terrorism co-existing with each other.<br>  <br>  This is what sets India apart from other countries. Always exciting. Always vibrant.<br>  <br>  Why do westerners have negative views? Simple, the media has not done its job in advertising the real India. Instead, its always the poverty that hogs the limelight.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	Americans have very little knowledge about other countries, this is not the perception we have in the UK.<br>  <br>  India was part of the British Empire for many years and the Kings of the UK were also Emperors of India. Because of this we have strong links with india and a large Asian population in the UK.<br>  <br>  Nobody sees India that way in the UK.|`|ksXayEUoaa	Maybe you need to meet new people and try not to stereotype Americans.<br>  USA is a huge country and we all aren't the same.<br>  <br>  There are many Indian doctors and CEOs where I live as well as clerks.  India is viewed as a peaceful nation which is why a lot of business is conducted there. That's why Al-Qaeda made that a target. They knew people would be flying in from around the world to conduct their business there because they view it as safe. They don't want anyone to feel safe anywhere.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	It's because the media controls what is considered newsworthy. Negative events get viewers. That's not to say that positive info does not but just watch the local news. it is always a disaster, a crime, a fire, or some other drama event that soaks up the news. Only those with well rounded contact on true current events and trends know the reality.|`|Pwmcpo5Paa	It isnt just India citizens of the USA think every other country negatively|`|p8nDiI3Vaa	All I know is that since your from India, somebody's gettin' pregnant. Come here girl.|`|pueeMH6gaa	There are positive things?|`|9i1r2VBHaa	In all seriousness the ones that are most in the public eye don't do much for the image. Once they "conform" to western things, like personal hygiene it will get easier for them. I for one don't think India is a third world country. A .50 cent slurpee with a purchase of a Hustler magazine is a hell of a deal. Pretty advanced thinking on their part.|`|9cpKYneZaa	India's been very fortunate in that its tech and pharmaceutical industries have brought a certain degree of prosperity. However, like the rest of Asia, it still has a great deal of poverty and a caste system to contend with.|`|x3CXKalvaa	See, most americans, as shown on this website, are stupid.<br>  India is my favorite country and I can't wait to visit it. I mean come on.|`|PHlcM9YFaa	Actually I never had a bad thought of India until you said something.|`|n708rCp0aa	the media.<br>  they dont get a good story out of the good of it, i guess..|`|S9XPuDPaaa	They say even worse things about Pakistanis and Muslims. This is something created by the media/govt. and lack of understanding of another culture. Americans like to think that they're the best and everyone else is some kind of poor, savage, moon worshiper and that there are criminals/terrorists roaming around freely. they forget that U.S. has one of the highest crime rates in the world. I say the best way to find out about a place or culture is to travel and see things for yourself, but then the govt. starts giving negative travel advice so that it can keep you from discovering that the person at the other side is a sane Human being. All too often, I hear things like "I can't go to place x because they'll kidnap me" and I can barely hold my laugh.|`|TyuZ06UCaa	India is quite beautiful, but there are many stupid  things in India  such as the cast system. Take it from an indian girl, who is "Brahmin". I live in Canada, and i absolutly hate my culture other than the fact that it teaches you to respect your parents. Speaking of parents, i was lucky to have been brought up by a very liberal and modern family who believes in the equality among women which is another major flaw in indian culture. None the less, people have absolute no right sterotyping and labeling India because, India has one of the smartest and richest people in the world. Thus in conclusion, people who have watched slum dog millionare, and now think that they know what India is, are complete idiots and do not even have a right to talk about any country.|`|46ZGLs43aa	Seriously, where are you people meeting Americans?  I've been to India and I do not have a bad impression of India or Indians.  I loved the time I spent there and I hope to go back and see more of the country.  It's interesting some of the responses here.  You don't like being stereotyped, but it's perfectly acceptable for you to stereotype others.  People on Y!A are constantly asking why there is so much racism in the world...take a look at your answers and the judgments you make and see if you can't see the answer in your own behavior.|`|XEQKAYFraa	um no but a lot of people don't know because we're not taught about other cultures and societies in our normal k-12 schooling|`|43D89edDaa	Most Americans think what the TV tells them my friend. Most people never have been to India themselves and sadly Americans eat up the message(s) that the television feeds them. The only news coverage I can remember seeing are of men in fields and starvation and stuff. Plus movies too. <br>  <br>  I know that isn't ALL of india though. This is the ignorant sludge that is surrounding the minds of too many Americans and even in other international societies we are led to believe what the media wants us to believe.<br>  <br>  There are too few people out their that rely on checking multiple sources and personal experience before coming up with a conclusion.... but hey thats life. All you can do is control who you want to be and hopefully you can influence others to be more socially, geographically, and internationally educated.<br>  <br>  Good luck my friend!|`|DVOoH4oxaa	The only thing most westerners know about India and other so-called third world countries is what they see on television and in the movies. Many do not know how beautiful the culture and environment really is there because they never want to know. Many believe what they want from television and the news and that is all they know. It is their own ignorance showing when they answer you in that way, others simply never thought to find out for themselves. Most countries that we westerners see on tv and in the news only show the bad parts of every society and not the beauty of each culture.|`|oa0xr3Yjaa	I think the American perspective of India has been set to a particular mindset through the media. For example, one of the most popular movies of all time, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, portrays India as a place where people eat bugs and monkey brains, while most Indians are actually vegetarians. Movies and media also show only the negative aspects of India, such as the poverty, so it is no wonder that Americans see India as a place of slums and poverty. <br>  <br>  In the same way as Americans see all Irish people playing bagpipes or wearing green, elephants have been deeply ingrained in the American perspective of Indian culture. The true culture and empires of India has been obscured and warped by the media, who are largely at fault here. Some more recent shows have been showing India's beauty, like shows on PBS.<br>  <br>  The growth of Indians has taken root in America along with many other countries and just now people are beginning to realize the Indians mental capabilities. Many Americans are out of business right now, and most companies have a majority of Asians in employment, a large amount of which are Indians. Pointing this out may provoke anger, but it is true.<br>  <br>  Obviously, India is hidden to the Western world as an uncivilized place, but only by visiting or living there will the truth be exposed.
HimBbU6caa	They were for the most part able to subjugate and control the surrounding people for a very long time, but their practice of human sacrifice made them hated and feared. Once Cortez and the Spaniards came the **** pretty much hit the fan. The surrounding tribes happily sided with the Spanish. Choosing the lesser of the two evils so to speak.<br>  <br>  There may be a decent article on Wiki, but I'm not sure.|`|kL8BzsBNaa	Fear, the emperors were viewed as human forms of a God. To go against the emperor and the empire would be the same as damning yourself to their version of "hell". Sound similar eh?|`|d00EEVWdaa	Mostly through fear and intimidation. They collected taxes from other tribes and even took people away as tribute.<br>  Men were taken from villages and used as human sacrifices to the sun god (Cutting out their hearts). Women were taken away and used for sex and labor.<br>  <br>  The Aztecs ruled from their capital city, Tenochtitlan, now Mexico City. At the height of the Aztec Empire the capital had more than 300,000 population. <br>  The location of the city made it almost impossible to attack. The city was an island fortress in the middle of a lake.<br>  <br>  The Aztecs had a well organized government, army, and engineers who built walls to surround the city and protect it.<br>  <br>  The Aztecs were very advanced and ruled with brutal authority. When the Spanish Conquerors came, the other tribes so hated the Aztecs that they helped the invaders overthrow them.|`|OUrPPjcHaa	Well, one thing I can think of is that they were paid tribute every once in a while by rival tribes.
JWjq5iaXaa	I believe this.<br>  <br>  The human's quest is for comfort and knowledge.<br>  <br>  Humans strive for food and shelter, and warmth. But when a human has these things, what can the human do? It will strive for it's psychological needs, after it's physical needs.<br>  <br>  It's two major psychological needs are comfort and understanding (knowledge). How do we achieve these things?<br>  <br>  Comfort (being completely opinionated), is a human's #1 luxury. Every human has what they consider to be comfortable... for some, it's a physical comfort, like a nice, warm bed. Others, it's a psychological comfort, like the feeling of being safe. <br>  <br>  Knowledge and Understanding is a huge strive for humans. Humans want to know everything... or at least, what they THINK is everything. It is impossible to know everything that has ever happened, but when human comes across new, important information, it holds it and keeps it, and strives for more. How does this happen? by listening and reading. What can a human listen to and read? Information. and stories are just another type of information.<br>  <br>  So stories are read and heard for mainly 2 reasons... It's simple entertainment (which traces back to comfort) and it's considered knowledge, and if a human knows it, he is happy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I love talking about stuff like this, email me sometime.
mfNAdjVBaa	talking alot is a females trait, most men who do it are pussiez............just sayin|`|StRaKUf6aa	I'm not too fond of people because my odd personality makes it hard for me to relate to the average population.  I like being alone because when I'm around other people, I'm not usually received very well.  People usually just assume that I'm a snob or that I'm too weird to relate to (which are both true...what can I do about that?).  <br>  <br>  I'm much more comfortable being alone (or with my husband), where I can be myself without worrying about how the rest of the world is going to perceive me.  <br>  <br>  Another reason that I don't talk much is because when I was younger, I was very dorky and whenever I said something, it didn't come out right and everyone looked at me funny.  I was eventually discouraged from talking in groups of strangers altogether for the fear of being reprimanded again.  Embarrassing, eh?|`|pnxzK1nhaa	We don't care to hear ourselves talk I guess. I can tell you talk alot just by the details of your q you also sound like you change the subject alot and go into alot of detail about nothing.Anyways, i feel more comfy talking to people who don't talk alot and I also enjoy alone time. I get tired of being around others 24/7. The only people I can tolerate for longer than  a day would be my family and closest friends.I like to do my own thing most of the time.I have a hard time believing you are a good listener with the fact that you are a motor mouth.Most ppl who talk alot have listening probs and only talk because they love to hear themselves.I also hate making small talk w/ strangers about nothing.Soooo awkward!!|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Because that's just their personality or disposition. More than often I prefer my quiet time, and I don't live well with others. I'm not a recluse, however.|`|46fouwFfaa	It's not being anti-social. Most people like a balance of alone time and spending time with other people. I'm the type that needs more alone time than I do socializing. You may not understand because you're extroverted meaning that you seek excitement by interacting with other people. Introverts are interested in solitary activities like thinking, reading, drawing, etc which they enjoy. Whether people are up for socializing sometimes depends on their mood.|`|82av0TbQaa	I like to be by myself most of the time.  I will get asked to do things with coworkers, and I usually say no.  It's not that I am depressed or anything, that is just my personality.  I just like to relax, read a book and think about many things.  I find it more fun then going out with people.  Also, I only pick a few people to be close to.  I will go and do things, but only with one or two people at a time, and they have to be very close to me.  I see people at work do things with someone else they hardly know.  Some people are different I suppose.  Honestly, answer my question to a social person like yourself.  Why is it that I always deny hanging out with people, but I still get asked by the same people every time?  I would think they would get sick of me rejecting them.|`|pfke6Jieaa	i know what u mean man but this is an anti social country and everyone is independent in their relations with people so there are no close ties. if you keep looking you will find a lot of outgoing people who will talk and socialize with you. i always initiate conversations with people and i never just make it small talk, but i cant force everyone to be like me or talk its up to them to respond.<br>  <br>  talk to me man i talk to anyone on here. i get some emails from people and i just talk to them and try to make some conversation and go as far as i can go. just be relaxed and pressure other people we cant force everyone to talk to us if they dont want to.|`|imIe4gH5aa	I don't like socializing because I am too lazy, talking to people is an effort, small talk is bullsh** - why should I waste my time ? <br>  <br>  Another reason I don't want talk to people is that most people are so stupid it just frustrates me beyone belief and I want to punch them in the face - how is that for anti-social ? People MAKE me anti-social by being so stupid, ignorant, arrogant and illiterate.<br>  <br>  Starting to understand ?  I am not shy or ugly or miserable, I just don't see what is the point of talking to people I do not want to talk to, wasting my time (and probably theirs) when I could be doing something I actually ENJOY like listening to music ? <br>  <br>  I am not lonely, I just can not stand idiots. And sadly these days the majority of people are idiots.
KH9bbeCNaa	ppl there are extremely arrogant, its all about proving the next person wrong, ive always wondered why they need to go on R&S just to make a religious point, if u wanna be aitheist go ahead if u wanna believe in God go ahead|`|hBEfrv23aa	R&S is usually where I go to get my kicks for the day.<br>  <br>  <br>  That place is insane.<br>  <br>  <br>  Usually when I go there, I'm not sure whether to laugh, cry, or both.|`|AOZvz2dpaa	consider the source in that section.........|`|YsX44IEWaa	because the will not sodomize my va jay jay!

iZYw500Vaa	well i'm 17 and i just recently stopped smoking pot after being a daily smoker for years...<br>  <br>  Why?<br>  Besides becoming very forgetful... Smoking makes me happy and when i dont smoke i feel like i dont know myself and i feel empty.. which is something am trying to change thats why i stopped..<br>  <br>  Other than that marijuana is not really a bad thing :)) I wouldnt consider it a drug.<br>  <br>  I guess is ok to smoke maybe once a day for some people or every now and then for other people... But dont let it control you!|`|vHktLKiMaa	Marijuana has been proven to be as harmful as cigarettes to the lungs.<br>  Long term usage has reported dementia,  Alzheimer's and chronis respiratory problems. It is a drug and thus has its side effects.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to these people who claim it is the miracle drug and nothing can go wrong, they are as brainwashed and the people trying to avoid drugs altogether.<br>  <br>  I guess what Im trying to say is like many things, marijuana should be taken in moderation. Recreational use if you will.|`|UCQ2yr5Vaa	I smoked pot for years.<br>  I tried to be cool, but it always made me feel self conscious about my self. But if I mixed it with booze, I didn't feel so self conscious.<br>  <br>  At one time I was going thru an ounce a week ( it was only $15 and ounce back them - I think it was up to like $250 an ounce when I stopped using it)<br>  <br>  But anyway, I got to thinking, why does anyone need to smoke a joint or however many joints a day? It sounded pretty stupid to me. Was my life so bad that I had to get high every day. If so, that was pretty pathetic and I wasn't going to live like that. <br>  <br>  The same was true with drinking alcholol. I could drink anywhere from a six pack to case every day. Why was I doing that? Was I an alcohloic? So I put a stop to heavy drinking. <br>  <br>  Today, I haven't had a joint in years and I might have a beer once or twice a year.<br>  <br>  I think I kind of outgrew both of these habits. <br>  <br>  Smoking was the toughest thing I ever gave up. I use to smoke at least 3 packs a day of those. That was the one vice that I definately needed to give up.|`|TyuZ06UCaa	first of all. Never smoked weed before but one joint= 4 cigerettes u do the math.|`|PCKNHjE2aa	Marijuana is used as medicine nowdays in 9 states so far.<br>  <br>  It does more good than harm. <br>  I know people who have smoked for years, and did no harm.<br>  Its impossible to get addicted to marijuana.<br>  Did you know that NOBDOY in history has ever died from marijuana?<br>  its impossible. <br>  <br>  Ciggarettes are more harmful than marijuana.<br>  <br>  I smoke occasionally, and i went to med school, and graduated with a Phd. <br>  <br>  I am 28 years old and starting my first year as a medical doctor at Saint Anthony's Hospital.<br>  <br>  There's alot of talk out there about marijuana being bad ONLY because the goverment wants you to think that way. <br>  <br>  They dont want people to know the truth behind marijuana, and the truth is that marijuana is SAFER than alochol and ciggarettes. <br>  <br>  Marijuana is prescribed for people with cancer and eating disorder's.<br>  <br>  its nothing like crack,heroin, or anything like that.<br>  <br>  its not really a drug.<br>  Its only a drug because its illegal.<br>  <br>  And its only illegal because the goverment cant tax it like they can alcohol and ciggs.|`|QGlJlIyAaa	well they claim that the chemical in it is harmful to your braincells... I am sure it is, when you get high everything is so damn funny, because your dumbed up and numbed up... and resin can't be good for your lungs, not all of it goes in the pipe/bowl... it is in the smoke...|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Pros--I liked the buzz.<br>  Cons--chronic bronchitis, it IS illegal still, and cost.  I spent more on pot a month than I now pay for my Honda Accord EX.  I want something to show for my money.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure why I stopped.  I smoked daily for over a decade then I met a man who didn't smoke it.  We started dating and although he didn't mind me smoking, I usually waited until he left.  I smoked less and less.  One day, I started to think about it and realized that it had been a couple of months!  The longer it went, the more I didn't want to break my record.  It helped that I didn't have any close friends anymore who smoked.  Months turned into years.  Although my relationship with the man didn't work out, I never went back to smoking again.|`|LuIFkPfwaa	Why did I use it...nice mellow high, no anger issues with pot users.  Don't have to smoke it.  Although smoke is harsher than most tobacco, most don't smoke as much with pot.  Long term, over use of anything can cause health problems.  <br>  <br>  Why did I quit??  Because the tests for it's use became cheap enough that it was way too easy to get caught.  Unfortunately it's illegal so coming up positive could not only cost you your job but possibly some prison time.  Not worth the risk.

j0RNxGcZaa	Fair skinned was the right skin tone up until the Industrial Revolution. If you were fair skinned, it meant that you were wealthy and did not have to work in the field. Once people started working in factories, they did not go outside much or have vacations. So tan people were in. <br>  <br>  I think people get bored with what they have and would like to try something else. So, its both. People want to be something they aren't and the circumstances depict what skin tone people want.|`|9243ea0535f139ef664eccb335fe7179aa	fair skinned <br>  honey.|`|vELzvX2Laa	I am an Indian (from south Asia).

If you have a slim body and a clear skin, most men will fall for you despite your skin color and the texture of your hair. Salma Hayek is one of the best looking females and she is<br>  not a Blonde.
QD03bB8Aaa	contact between china and india is millennia old- commercial as well as cultural. it is therefore natural that there are many common words, mostly 'borrowings' from each other. the case is even stronger if we take regional languages like Malayalam, which had colonies of chinese settlers in the beginning of the christian era. one of the kings in (present day) state of Kerala had even an embassy in china.|`|n8WRDcHMaa	nice!|`|7f19096dfc203109750db707ef0faeedaa	What a coinky-dinky.

In fact, people claim that they are excited, but aren't ready for His second coming. In fact, people claim that they are excited, but still teach Matthew 24:36 or is it Luke 13:32 that no man can know the day or the hour. These kinds of people are claiming a 1000 year reign or whatever trying to prevent from thinking that Jesus will ever return in a few more years. Ask almost any Christian and they will tell you that Jesus Christ could come at any time when you least expect so get ready now, but most Christians out of FEAR and DEATH will continue to believe the Bible's saying that nobody can know when Christ will return. The first coming was a little horrible since only 3000 Saved Elect Souls were accepted into Christ's Church, yet there were thousands of more people in those days who weren't baptized into Christ's Church and Body of Believers. So it shall be with the Second Coming, Only Few Shall Be Saved And Washed By The Blood Of Christ And The Waters Of Eternal Life.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	Hey lukep:  I don't know if you've noticed, but people DO sacrifice animals - and lots of other valuable things - for our 'sins'.<br>  <br>  In fact, most of our sins (greed, hatred, cold-heartedness) directly affect animals through pollution etc.<br>  <br>  Mankind is still sinning up a storm at the expense of everything that shares the planet with us.<br>  <br>  In short, take your 'Jesus made animal sacrifices obsolete' and stick it where the sun don't sihne.|`|QIGtbYpEaa	we are excited because He's gonna take us hoe and we are going to be with Him 4ever!!

XQhrHiUcaa	Yes.  We have a requirement of a Kethuba which is a pre-nup.  It states the basic conditions for any divorce settlement.  While one is free to mention any amount in this document, the European Jews set a minimum amount of 200 Reichsthallers as a settlement amount in the middle ages.  The settlement amount is one of 10 requirements a husband has towards his wife in Judaism.|`|AA11047076	There is a pre-marriage contract that is required called the Ketubah.  it has specific provisions in ti from a religious point of view that are considered binding even if the Ketubah is not written.

kUNhq931aa	Do you have the arabic text? I will give you a better translation, if it's written in arabic =)<br>  <br>  Edit: Hun, it's only because in arabic, I will know how each word is pronounced. Two words will be spelled the same but when they are pronounced differently, they mean different things.<br>  <br>  Example:  Himmati could mean dilemma or mother-in-law depending on how u write it in arabic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Translation:<br>  <br>  1. "My dilemma, is a dilemma of Royalty (meaning it's a huge dilemma), and my soul is a free soul. In my view, lowliness/humiliation is a sin."<br>  <br>  "???? ???? ?????? ????? ???? ????? ?? ??? ?????? ????"<br>  <br>  NB: Soul is actually "Ruh" in Arabic. But in the context being used for that sentence, "nafsi" is used for soul. Also, the last part "taral maddalata kufraa" was difficult for me to comprehend w/o the correct arabic text.<br>  <br>  2. "If I live, it does not condemn power, and if I die, it does not condemn greatness/highness."<br>  <br>  "??? ?? ??? ?? ???? ????  ? ?? ??? ?? ???? ????  "<br>  <br>  NB:  Again, without the proper arabic text, I may be wrong, but I believe it's correct to a degree where it is along the same lines sis =)<br>  <br>  InshaAllah you have an idea of what these two sentences are about now. <br>  <br>  Goodnight =)|`|9QBlKlFmaa	Here are two translations that you will probably not get from anyone else:<br>  <br>  1.

Sounds interesting... <br>  <br>  Arabic words written with the original arabic letters are better to write down. Simply the taskeel is helping more. Let aside the 7 and 3 makes it really confusing. I know 3 is the ayin but it only shows that the Arabic isn't replaceable with other alphabetletters... <br>  <br>  Besides that you have different dialect in Arabic from Berber (Morocco) to Saudi and everything between (almost every Arabic country has it own Arabic dialect.. So if the translator is from Egypt, he will translate it on his way of speaking... Some use French words as Arabic... In other words that is what the other user tried to tell you aswell, it is to difficult to give a clear answer to you.. <br>  <br>  By the way i find it strange, that why would the article write it down in this way? If it is English article, clearly the article isn't complete. If it is Arabic how can it be that you can not read this text but the other text you haven't got any problems?|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	No idea<br>  <br>  I wish I could understand Arabic properly Insha'Allah that is my next step.

EufLQ9dKaa	Africa has been ripped of a lot of it's riches by europeans.  If you were to ever visit the continent, especially South Africa you'd see how all the Africans are forced to live in slums and all the Europeans live like normal priviledged people.  Apartheid really affected some parts of the continent.  However there are many wealthy Africans as well, all of what you see on television does not reflect the entire continent.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  The ecological impact of natural resource exploitation on the lives of the poor in Africa and other regions is not being addressed sufficiently in aid effectiveness and development discussions, aid experts say.

Well obviously in the animal kingdom, murder or other "evils" are not an issue because they do not have societal standards to live by, like us.

Humans believe that animalistic, self-serving acts are evil, even though they coincide with how humans NATURALLY act. Therefore, humans don't believe in an evil animal world because animals are not intelligent enough to act AGAINST their nature, and nothing, by it's nature, can be evil (except for man).|`|yaYm6pPOaa	Everything in the natural world is amoral except Humans.We make value judgements based on what is considered RIGHT OR WRONG - everything else behaves as is necessary...even if it appears "evil" from our perspective.

Animals act on instincts.  Evil is more than just harmful behavior to others. Looking sexually at another woman when you're married would still be "wrong" even if nothing came of it and it was all forgotten the next day. If I thought evil was a creation to describe behaviors, I'd be the most evil, manipulative, selfish person you'd ever meet.|`|cNniG2L0aa	No; I don't know that 'evil' is something that is able to 'exist' although I am fully aware that there are some bad bastards on the planet that I wish 'god' would strike dead ... but 'he' never does, does 'he'?<br>  ~

So I kissed her back.<br>  It was confusing because I thought I was straight, but it felt right, so I kept doing it lol.|`|BqXIltLqaa	It was a birthday party, he asked me to to go outside with him and while we were talking he leaned in, pulled me against him and kissed me. It happened so quickly I was WTF is going on (I was in the closet). I did kiss  him back though...LOL.|`|58uJI6bpaa	This was heavily influenced by alcohol (it was with a "straight guy")<br>  <br>  I wish I could quote it as you have, but I dont remember.

I had just come out to all of my friends that I was gay. I was at my friend's house (a girl) and her brother was hanging out with us to. His name is Shane and he is gay also. Katy (my friend) went into the kitchen and Shane was trying to make me feel more comfortable with my sexuality (it was still weird for me at that point). Later, he said he would drive me home. I got in the car and he asked if I wanted to go for a walk in the park, I said sure. So we went to the park. We were talking and he was telling me how he dealt with it when he first realized that he was truly gay. We sat down on a bench and...<br>  <br>  Shane: I like you Cody.<br>  Me: (me sitting there not saying anything)<br>  Shane: It's ok Cody, there's nothing wrong with liking me to. Do you?<br>  Me: Yeah.<br>  Shane: I'm guessing you've never kissed a guy before?<br>  Me: No...But I think I'm ready...<br>  Shane: You sure? I don't want to push you to take a step you're not ready for.<br>  Me: I'm sure.<br>  Then he leaned in and kissed me and I kissed him back. At first, I was scared out of my mind, but he made me feel really good and I liked it. It's nothing like kissing a girl. It's four years later and Shane and I are now together and we just moved in with each other.
c2QmSSCXaa	It will never really heal...<br>  You only learn how to look past it and live your life and not live by the scars it gives you. And to be true to your self and be the happiest you can be. You will remember it for the rest of your life but you cannot let it become an excuse NOT to live or love or laugh. And if he really did abuse you then you have all right to be upset. And you need to lay down the line and say what it did to you. And how it hurts YOU and tell those people if they don't understand like they should then their not the family you need. Make them understand why and explain to them. You deserve to live your life and have all the happiness in the world.|`|CIyQnx8Uaa	idk my boyfriend technicially "raped" me as in i said no but i still love him to death idk why im like addicted to him its sad i never told anyone b/c they will say leave him but i love him 4 years strong so hopefully forever|`|pfke6Jieaa	nope no one can sexually abuse me cuz i am too proud of my manhood. i would rather die than for someone to sexually abuse me. but i feel really sorry for the victims.|`|x62wDqmRaa	If you're saying your father did you, then go to the police and prosecute him for rape.|`|mfNAdjVBaa	yep, women sexually harrass me all the time, they try to get at me but when I dont give them the time of day they get upset and wont take no for an answer<br>  <br>  <br>  @hi hater- he technically raped you, you women sure know how to throw a guy in jail on a technicality|`|KH9bbeCNaa	tell someone like a counseller, tell the police if u hav to, its ur life not his and if it puts ur life on jeorpady you have 100% right to stop someone regardless of relationship<br>  <br>  its not ur fault, sexual abuse is never the victims fault, no matter how subtle it is, if ur sexually uncomfortable its sexual abuse|`|HimBbU6caa	Why aren't you at the door of your nearest police precinct?

Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead."<br>  <br>  And, Daniel 12:2, "And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."<br>  <br>  Matthew 25:46, "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal." <br>  <br>  This is why I believe in ghosts. They are the souls of dead people waiting for the Second Coming of Jesus. I do not understand how you can not believe in hell, when you are a Christian. The Bible is the infallible Word of God, and every word is true. You should do your research in the Bible, and you'll find many, many mentionings of hell. Whatever God says is real is real, and every word of the Bible is inspired by Him, so every word is true.|`|XpZumlkwaa	If you didn't skip 6 you would figure it out.<br>  He is speaking about the body in the grave.

AA10381258	Wow ... so we should punish innocent babies with HIV for their mother's promiscuous behavior.

Anyone can get HIV through having sex with a stranger whose sexual history remains unknown to you, sharing needles, having unprotected sex, infected blood mixing with uninfected blood (that's how it all began--monkey blood mixed with human blood), and an infected mother passing it onto her child. <br>  <br>  There are far more ways to get HIV and everyone can get it. STDs don't discriminate. <br>  <br>  And I'm also getting the feeling this guy is calling all women who've HIV, or tested for it in the least, whores? <br>  <br>  Besides, is it BAD to test people for an STD? A person who has it and doesn't know could go and spread it to everyone else! A pregnant woman who's infected could give it to her baby! Letting a potentially harmful disease spread without taking any action is unacceptable, not trying to prevent it!<br>  <br>  EDIT: jojo, my question for you is, how do you "keep it in your pants" if you don't know you have HIV?|`|mSFjbetxaa	What a dumb@ss.<br>  <br>  If the HIV is discovered while the child is in the womb, the baby has an excellent chance of being born without the condition.<br>  <br>  He is just another ignorant fundie, nothing more.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Might have known it was a Republican.

AA11115051	I've done it and I'm sorry for it one should be honest when testifying. Because with GOD the most simplest looking thing might be the most meaningful. But it is not us saving the souls but JESUS CHRIST. We are only but lights that point toward the way, so that his name is glorified for ever and ever. amen|`|1cc22a420cd1103618bcd0912740454faa	As a Christian absolutely "NO" - why ?  Because to deal with anyone including ones self outside of truth and reality, whether it be to "save their soul" (for his or her own benefit, in other words), this would be misleading and therefore, a lie !  It is never right nor proper, as a Christian to mislead or lie to another person - even ones self for benefit.  "Soul saving", in my opinion, is an exercise for the ego !  It serves nothing but to sales-pitch in God's Name thus, demonstrating a lack of faith, on behalf of the believer to trust God to do the converting !|`|sMerTT0zaa	I don't think that i would. because i don't want them to decied to try and then not think it was the same and never try again. If you tell them the truth over and over again you can end up converting them. It is also lying and that is aganist what i believe in.|`|VvyJ1yRUaa	no i would not and i dont either the pleasures are real and my relationship with God is soo  amazzing but i guess some atheists assume i'm exhaggerating??|`|ySu9DihZaa	I'm not actually following a religion right now, but when I was, yes i did.|`|CEQpDpnPaa	no. i don't have to lie|`|BZoBSjNiaa	a true conversion is not by convincing words.

4aveC2aaaa	men arent even supposed to do anything with their eyebrows<br>  <br>  i yell at my cousin all the time, wont listen<br>  <br>  we are not to shape our eyebrows, but about unibrows, removing some hair from the middle is ok i think, but dont shape them into thin lines. dont shape them at all|`|AYs6iFlLaa	The area between the eye brows is the forehead, and it is not wrong to remove this hair. Your eyebrow begins directly above your tear ducts and hair between these points can be removed.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	My brother gets his eyebrows trimmed. Lmao. I started cracking up when he told me this.<br>  <br>  Anyways, no. You can remove the hairs in the middle.|`|LmKVepcXaa	I believe that a women can remove the hair from between her eyebrows. Men are not supposed to though, as far as I know.|`|9085d5e62eea0b47f788548bcb282266aa	It's your eyebrows, has nothing to do with the worship of Allah you can cut it if you want. Make sure it looks normal.|`|MA7DMPb7aa	I agree with anonymous 110%<br>  on second thought maybe i do nominate her as queen.....|`|3E2EQH12aa	nope. reshaping the eyebrows is haram, but plucking the hair in between is not. its not part of the eyebrows.. thats why its called eye brow S , not eyebrow|`|7dGpL4mSaa	No, it's not haram. Just make sure you remove none of the eyebrow itself.
U2qRvH2laa	Why would an "educated society" condone the immoral activity that propagates HIV and spreads it to other Innocent people that eventually kills off that society.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	Explain the Justice in persecuting a group of people for who they fall in love with.  Incest produces offspring with physical defects.  I can explain why I am against that, for that forces a child to inherit birth defects because of it's parent's lust.  I have no such critique for homosexuality, because it produces no offspring.  It would be like saying a heterosexual couple that are barren cannot marry because they cannot reproduce.<br>  <br>  I'm sure there are many people who have an aversion to their white daughters and sons dating an African American, but they too are uncomfortable with the term "racist".  Do you have a better name?  Because I have a feeling that you are not so uncomfortable with the names than you are with the understanding that being called such a name suggests you are standing against, not for, the concepts of Justice in a society.  This is why I ask you to produce Just reasons for believing that homosexuality is "wrong", and to not simply bow before a 2000 year-old tome and explain away Justice with some sycophantic relationship to a religious choice you have made personally.  And after you have searched your heart there, ask exactly what price the religion is paying for the need to promote Justice by claiming absolute authority from it's pages instead of through a people's ability to discuss their national conscience through debate.  We don't become a Just Society by giving away our authority to the past...we become Just by continually asking the question "What is Justice?".  Hopefully, you'll learn that someday.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Of course it's homophobia. Fear of, dislike, and aversion to gay people, no matter what the reason, is homophobia.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It doesn't matter if the word has phobia in it or not, it still means what it means. We could invent another word for it, but it would mean the exact same thing. Would you prefer "heterosexist," because it's that too.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	It's because you "believe" it to be wrong for no good reason.<br>  <br>  Just because your holy book condemns homosexuality doesn't make that a legitimate reason for you to do so, nor does it exempt you from criticism for holding such a view.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	I'm not sure I follow your reasoning.  Are you asking about homosexuality or opposition to homosexuality?  Homosexuality is not homophobia.<br>  <br>  I'll assume for the sake of argument that you are asking about people's reasons for opposing the toleration or promotion of homosexual recreations.  <br>  <br>  I oppose further preferential treatment of homosexuals for the same reason that I believe government should not be making it easier to commit adultery or incest.  These things are harmful to our spiritual health and eternal happiness.  Whether they in fact are sinful or not almost doesn't matter.  I just don't want any of Heavenly Father's children to be disappointed in the end.|`|n1eXQr5oaa	no because incest had biological and social negatives (therefore you dislike incest for a reason)...<br>  <br>  there is no actual negative when it comes to homosexuality (hence those against it are homophobic)<br>  <br>  EDIT: actually a phobia is a strong dislike of (usually in an irrational sense)... GUESS WHAT homophobics are both irrational and dislike homosexuals...<br>  <br>  OWNED|`|NWopkX4baa	Yes it's homophobia. Incest harms their children, homosexuality hurts no one. That's why opposing homosexuality is homophobia, beause there is no reason to oppose it except the Bible.|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	why is homophobia a biblical demand? why aren't those pages just ripped out along with other stuff that was removed because it was cr*p.|`|ce26AOVzaa	1. The bible.<br>  2. There is more holes in a woman.<br>  3. I love children.<br>  4. woman have breasts and things I do not have.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no its not homophobia<br>  <br>  <br>  its a sinful choice as are many things God declares|`|2NjUK2kRaa	huh I believe homosexuality is wrong and an abomination|`|xPeIvywdaa	it shouldnt be considered homophobia..but thats how the liberals play the game|`|d6Y9N2p1aa	The answer IMO is dependant on whether or not some form of rational thought could convince you that it is not immoral. <br>  If you believe homosexuality is immoral because a 2000 year old book says so. That is not homophobic per-se (its just stupidity), IF you are dogmatic (ie you literally interpret everything the bible says) if you are selectively choosing what to believe, odds are you are homophobic hiding behind the bible. <br>  sure plenty of people might be incestaphobic, but thats ok because there are logical reasons to be against incest - such as the abuse of power in a relationship, and biological reasons to name a few. I also don't care about the reasons why you are against murder, rape, etc. <br>  being against homosexuality is irrational because no logical reason will hold water to it, that isnt a double standard currently in society. gay sex can spread disease, so can hetero sex, etc.|`|LIY8QrgMaa	Its important to note that most atheists have no problem with homosexuality, because there is logically very little wrong with it, and we like to think logically. <br>  <br>  So, people who think homosexuality is wrong usually have a religious motivation somewhere.<br>  <br>  And the concept of an 'incestaphobic' is ridiculous. You can be against incest without being afraid of it. I'm not afraid of it, but I am against it due to the various biological issues associated with it.<br>  <br>  In the same way, you don't have to be afraid of homosexuals to be against their sexual tendencies. Someone who is a homophobic is literally TERRIFIED of homosexuals, or homosexual behaviour.<br>  <br>  The term 'homophobic' is thrown around a little too much these dies in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Gay is not a synonym for shitty.|`|VyfTq5Dnaa	nah im pretty cool with being a homophob<br>  i think its funny when people call me a homophob like its a bad thing<br>  buy the way i dont really care what people do its just a lot gay people i know are really annoying<br>  im kinda old school though <br>  dont really like hangn with girly boys|`|mwdtZUPkaa	OK...|`|SWYB8iQEaa	if you don't like the term then don't be one.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	If you believe that it is wrong, you are foolish.  Is it hurting anyone?  Of course not.  So it's none of your business.<br>  <br>  I personally, hate the word homophobe.  It's the only word for a prejudiced person that places the blame for the hatred on the one being hated.  If you're racist, you hate people of other races.  If you hate women, you're sexist, if you hate gays, it's because gays are scary!  It's a terrible word and needs to be replaced with homosexist, placing the blame on the hateful person.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't care if you think that gays are bad, but you're voting for them to not have equal rights, aren't you?  THAT'S the problem.  Christians make me cringe, but I'm not trying to make laws to tear down the churches because I acknowledge that it's none of my business.  I used to be a vegetarian, but I never tried to destroy any restaurants.  I think Stephen King is a terrible writer, but I haven't tried to put his books out of print.  I only fight against things that hurt me.<br>  <br>  So in short, no, you're not a homophobe: you're a jerk.  Happy?|`|DzGKfdKnaa	I just invented a word called "christaphobia" it sort of makes sense too.<br>  <br>  If you have my same worldview that is.<br>  <br>  example: "OMG would you get a load of all the christaphobes here!? LOL they say you fear that which you cannot understand, and after all their disdain is only a manifestation of fear"
GItBUBL9aa	Because the flood was local and not all people besides Noah and his family were killed.  The word translated as earth, "eretz," is also the word for land, as in a local geographical area, and it's translated that way in the Bible hundreds of times.  <br>  <br>  When it says the earth was flooded, it was speaking of their civilization.  So, in answer to your question, God couldn't start over again with Eden afresh since there were lots of people not killed in the flood.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	dude, get a life.<br>  <br>  since it's all nothing to you anyway, why do you even care?|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	If you would read Genesis for yourself rather than basing your "knowledge" on what you hear, you'd have a better understanding.<br>  <br>  Not to be a dick or anything|`|9qUnD0sBaa	You are right, I think he just cant stand us.

Adam and Eve were the parents of mankind. When they fouled up; the sin rooted in humankind. Men and women thought of violence constantly. During Noah's time the earth was so full of constant violence that God thought it best to destroy all mankind - except Noah and his family - and start over. (Noah was a righteous man, a godly man.)

It was up to Adam to watch the garden and tend it as God told Adam to.<br>  Adam was asleep when the serpent crawled up that tree and tempted Eve.<br>  Since God is Omni-Present, He knew that Adam and Eve would fall into temptation, so since the Flood of Noah the garden was removed to heaven where it remains along with the Tree Of Life.<br>  Because the temptation was too great for mankind to endure the garden which was a testing ground for the first human beings, it stands to reason that God would not put the garden back, or the two Trees.|`|e599f8e9840310f064e7afa7423bfa60aa	He did several do-overs with the creation thing.

QEuhPEb7aa	In a way, religion is simply a defense mechanism of a person for not being able to explain some things.<br>  <br>  It helps a person cope up with the problems they have in life.<br>  <br>  The idea of heaven one day was proposed probably due to the suffering of Christians through the ages, say the Black Plague or the many persecutions of Christians.<br>  <br>  I understand your point on giving credit as well.<br>  <br>  Religion teaches people to thank God when something good happens and blame themselves/others when bad things happen.<br>  <br>  They place God as a perfect being who can never be wrong or evil. They however place humanity as the culprit for every bad thing that happens.<br>  <br>  To make it worse, some denominations say that the devil causes us to do bad. Well in that case, why not send the devil to hell or to jail if you commit a crime? It makes people immature because they are bred to believe that some purely evil being causes them to do evil.<br>  <br>  Religion in fact also removes freedom from a person. If a God somewhere know everything, then everything you do is fated. Nothing at all is left for you to decide. You just live a life that's already been planned.<br>  <br>  How cruel is this if heaven and hell were real ?<br>  <br>  To believe in a religion anyway, either you know everything or you happily know nothing.|`|s25JpCwkaa	I agree with you.  But religious folk may counter and say that God guided the surgeons hands or whatever.  We are wee mortals however and to claim we know how everything started is as far fetched as saying one magic guy poofed the universe out of thin air.  To each is own I say.|`|ao2mP5pNaa	When good things happen, it was a gift from god.  When bad things happen, they pray harder.  So which one is it?  Is god kind or a douchebag?<br>  <br>  How come I live completely godlessly, yet the ratio of good-to-bad things that happen to me seems about consistent with the norm?  I certainly didn't PRAY.|`|2OnP6Mfbaa	I agree with you. it's all you..but I'm not saying that there isn't a God. because, I think there is..but if you get over cancer..it was in your destiny...but I think that it was all you and not God.|`|rGsHlvtaaa	yes but god helped the doctor find the cure.<br>  <br>  well thats what most people might say...<br>  <br>  idk what to believe anymore.|`|t2x7Cr6Gaa	em i dont know|`|hCpqhn27aa	I definitely agree with Stephen King on this one. Consider this:<br>  <br>  A good thing happens to a good/faithful person: The religious person says God is rewarding the person's goodness/faithfulness.<br>  A bad thing happens to a good/faithful person: The religious person says God is testing their faith or using an ordeal to make them stronger/lead them to something better.<br>  A good thing happens to a bad/irreligious person: The religious person says God is showing his mercy and love toward the person/trying to bring them around to the light.<br>  A bad thing happens to bad/irreligious person: The religious person says God is punishing evil/showing them they can't get by without him.<br>  <br>  There is no need, in the religious person's mind, for God to show any consistency whatsoever in his actions. What is clearly just a bunch of random events--good/bad things happening randomly to good/bad people without regard for their goodness/faithfulness--is all interpreted by the religious as part of something bigger. It makes no sense. It's obviously just stuff happening; the complete amorality of it all, the total lack of any intention or plan behind it, is glaringly obvious to the thinking mind.|`|kuFAx4ymaa	Science is a relatively new concept in terms of human society...  For thousands of years the only explination was that some force we could not understand, that was much larger than us, is in control of everything.<br>  <br>  We now know that most things are governed by a series of interconnected systems which can be broken down in the smaller parts and understood when studied correctly.<br>  <br>  Religious faith is still around because the vast majority of people are not scientific in the way they conduct themselves or in the way they view the world.  In fact most people wouldn't understand a theory even if they were taught everything about it...<br>  <br>  They dont seem to believe in the power of human understanding...  Even though the bible says "God created man in his own image"  Which I interpret as "God gave the ability to understand as he does, the systems around them"  I mean, if there is a God...  I somehow doubt he looks like an image of a human...|`|qWwUxhFkaa	God gave us minds to think for ourselves. And along with that, he had given us "tools" on this earth for purpose for both good and evil (cure for cancer and a nuclear bomb) <br>  And if people really think these thoughts every second of the day, we would be worrying about messing up, than doing good. Just live ur life in the present and make it worth ur lifetime for urself and other people. :)|`|AA10153555	that's a lie..and you are forgetting about self. Self causes many things in this world.

God healed me because I believed him.|`|LyFQqtb5aa	I'm not even a religious person and I still disagree with you|`|UklOkMMAaa	Its crap!|`|YEtBzYXzaa	I completely agree with you. When i was younger I lost someone I loved, and was told that 'God has a reason for everything he does' by my pastor, to which I responded, 'I want nothing to do with a God that would make innocent people suffer for his 'grand scheme', and have been agnostic ever since. I have nothing against religion, until it reaches those extremes where everything has to be by God's hand, what then is the point of life if we have no control. Stephen King is my favorite author (and The Stand my favorite book), he touches on this subject some more in his 'Dark Tower' series, where the characters learn that they are part of a novel being written, one of his greatest works.|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	All science backs God. I've been getting deep into religious philosophy and unless you believe the scifi bullsh** some of the atheist philosophers do (11th dimension, spacetime, bendylight, etc) there's no way around it.<br>  <br>  My site is nowhere near done but if you wanna see some of my theories check the "Evidence in existence" page. <a href="http://DawkinsNightmare.webs.com" rel="nofollow">http://DawkinsNightmare.webs.com</a>|`|mAZi1eH7aa	No, it only explains everything to the weak minded. You have missed the more important parts where it is set out as our duty to be our own person. To be ourselves and do the right thing. The only thing that God and Satan are proof of is why we are here and that someone is after us and that we have a choice on what we do. Other than that, everything is up to us, to chance and opportunity, to the restrictions of our existence and pushing the boundaries and to recognizing each person as an individual and important being and that nature has all we need to find the answers. Nothing is handed to us other than life and the ability to choose our own course. The rest is up to us as both individuals and as a whole. No predetermination or map is provided. The only guide is a set of rules and truths provided in the religious texts, but that is all. All the failures and all the victories are completely up to us. Nothing is suggested or promised otherwise.|`|AA11616515	I can’t argue with your thoughts on religion – religion is what man thinks of God <br>  Christianity however is a way of life, and whether you believe it or not everything in the Bible will come to pass. <br>  Men have come and gone -  they have beat upon the Word of God and rejected it, they are all dead without hope, and yet the Word of God lives on, and is believed in the hearts and minds of Christians today. <br>  So dismiss the power of God if you will and believe what you want it will not affect those of us who live the life of abundance that God has given.|`|WCqHEUBdaa	My overly religious dad is a minister and he would say that God gave the Dr the knowledge to cure the cancer.

OtKCAeQZaa	It seem like your dream is preparing you to have children, for your dreams bring joy into your life, and you are wounding about this. You will have kids.|`|mRlO0Ftoaa	may be you are going to have a kid soon......lol....this has always happened in most of the families including mine....they interpret it as a sign of a birth of a baby|`|eXzUJbQJaa	It could be that ur gonna have ur own family soon, or its trying to remind of u when u were a kid, etc|`|UAq9ogIQaa	i dont know the meaning,but i do know this......<br>  your subconscious self is trying to tell you something.<br>  i have been studying dreams,and i know that they are there to speak to us,and reveal hidden things to our great benefit if we can figure them out.the child or children might represent you,some repressed thing is trying to speak.<br>  try a online dream dictionary,and study all aspects of your dream,for instance the colour blue,that the child you saw also represents something,look up what children,blue,birthdays and what ever else you see means,then put it all together.<br>  the very fact that you remember your dreams,points to the seriousness of your minds desire for you to learn what i wants to tell you,there is many differant levels to you,there is your concsious self(who you are when your awake and just living)and there is your sleeping partner,often refered to you subconscious self.<br>  for instance lately i have been dreaming alot of dreams about pickup trucks,when i looked it up in my dream dictionary it said trucks represent that i am carrying to great a load emoitionaly,and i am burdening myself with to much guilt or grief....it was right.<br>  since trucks represent carrying loads and heavy burdens.<br>  good luck,i hope you find what it means...|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	Sometimes our dreams are our anxieties.  Maybe it represents your fears and anxiety about becoming a responsible guardian over children.  It may represent your view of yourself when meeting life's rites of passage.<br>  <br>  So if you put your fears in those dreams, you are:<br>  <br>  1.  afraid of an arranged marriage because you think you are too young, or that you feel you are immature and out of control of marriage<br>  2.  afraid of other people's offspring, or afraid of responsibility for children that do not belong to you.<br>  3.  in the third dream, I think the boy in blue was you.  Don't know how else to interpret that.<br>  4.  afraid of children getting the upper hand of you.<br>  <br>  It might also be a symbolic progression, meaning that you feel you are losing control of your maturity.<br>  <br>  You're not alone; I have nightmares of babysitting too.|`|JWjq5iaXaa	I'm not a therapist, but I am kind of good with this stuff. This is what I can piece together.<br>  <br>  Not many people know it, but dreams are largely based on symbolism.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1st dream:<br>  _____________________________<br>  "i dreamt of two kids, around 6 a boy and a girl having an arranged marriage."<br>  _____________________________<br>  ---The children symbolize something new or responsability.<br>  ---The wedding symbolizes a major event, most likely happy.<br>  ---The fact that the wedding is arranged shows the event isn't happy, but forced or inevitable. <br>  <br>  So, what does this mean? I don't know much about your life, but it most likely means that <br>  a) You want something new in your life, but fear the responsibility<br>  b) You fear for the well-being of something new in your life.<br>  c) You are thinking about something new in your life eventually coming to an end<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2nd dream:<br>  _____________________________<br>  i was taking care of a healthy baby for some friend of mine (in a dream)<br>  _____________________________<br>  ---The act of Caretaking symbolizes responsibility<br>  ---The baby symbolizes new life or something new<br>  ---The friend symbolizes your family or someone close to you, maybe the person saw in the dream.<br>  <br>  This dream is similar to your first, so you can already tell these dreams are based around the same thing. This dream in particular most likely means:<br>  a) There's something new in your life that you're happy about<br>  b) You have unwanted but necessary responsibilities involving your family or friends.<br>  c) Something new in your life relates to your family.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  3rd dream:<br>  _____________________________<br>  i was with my family and some random boy comes up wearing blue and looks after me.<br>  _____________________________<br>  ---Your family represents people close to you, like your friends and family.<br>  ---The random boy symbolizes an upcoming event you didn't think about<br>  <br>  I can't tell you much about this dream, because I don't know what you mean by "looks after me", but what I can tell you is the dream has something to do with:<br>  a) something happening with your family that you weren't expecting (not necessarily a bad thing)<br>  b) You are thinking of things in the future that you never thought about before.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  4th dream:<br>  _____________________________<br>  a 6 year old boy who was beating me up, and then a whole bunch of other children having a birthday party.<br>  _____________________________<br>  ---The boy who was beating you up depends...<br>  ----------Was he just attacking you without being a threat?<br>  ----------Was he actually hurting you, and did you fear him?<br>  ---the other children having a party symbolizes people you know (maybe friends or family, maybe just acquaintances) <br>  ---The party symbolizes a good event.<br>  <br>  This is a tough dream, I don't really understand it. The child attacking you obviously represents a bad thought. If he attacks you without being a threat, you're thinking of an annoyance or a minor event you regret. If he was hurting you and you feared him, it could mean the fear of a tragedy, or violence. I'm not sure how to relate the other symbols with this, but the only thing I could imagine would be:<br>  a) you're regretting something done/said to a group of people (maybe at a party?)<br>  b) You fear something will happen if you are with the wrong people.<br>  c) In an upcoming event where you will see people you know, you're afraid something will go wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So, putting all the dreams together, there is a pattern. It seems the two major factors in these dreams are something new in your life, and your family/friends.You're also thinking about responsability and events. Think about what's happening in your life right now and try to see how these piece into the events. Considering I don't know anything about your life except that you're 20, I can't help you here.<br>  <br>  If I could sum it all up, I'd say you are thinking of something big happening in your life soon, and you will care for it deeply, but you fear for the well-being of it and you think you might not be able to deal with the responsibility. Whatever this is, it will greatly involve your family and friends. <br>  <br>  Maybe it's a relationship, maybe a child, or even a personal possession like a car or house. Things like this bring responsibility and a fear of loss. Whatever it is, it's important to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Everything I say are complete maybe's, They could mean something completely different.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm glad if I could help, this was fun.

It might be unfair, bigoted, backwards, and hypocritical, but not unconstitutional.<br>  <br>  The problem is that we give tax breaks to the chruches that openly campaign for legal issues.

The schools already do that. It's not going to force churches to marry gay people.

It did violate the California Constitution.  According to their constitution, rights cannot be taken away from people by plebiscite. That's exactly what Prop. 8 did.<br>  <br>  Voting on whether or not to allow gay marriage is no more correct than it would have been to ask the South to vote on interracial marriage in the 50's or 60's. Interracial marriage would have been voted down overwhelmingly. But wisely, it wasn't put to a vote. The Supreme Court said that marriage was a fundamental human right, and the states couldn't infringe on it. (Loving v. Virginia)<br>  <br>  Even with that ruling, some southern states didn't remove their miscegenation laws from the books until the 21st century! I guess they were hoping they could turn back the clock and undo everything that had been accomplished.<br>  <br>  Face the facts: Marriage is a basic human right. All people are entitled to it, and according to the Supreme Court, states can't interfere with it. And I'm certainly not going to let someone else's religion interfere with it.|`|mSFjbetxaa	No, you do not have it right.<br>  <br>  <br>  When the election itself was to promote bigotry and ignorance while denying others their constitutional rights, than that is not OK.<br>  <br>  Forcing bigotry and ignorance into our laws is unconstitutional.

California and other states have overturned ballot measures before.  Were militant anti-gay activists complaining then?<br>  <br>  If we had allowed people in Arkansas to vote on whether or not Black students could attend Little Rock High, the majority would have said no. We know now that this attitude is immoral.<br>  <br>  Rather than trying to justify redefining morality so that people believe "treat others as you want to be treated" really means "take away the civil rights from law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans," radical anti-gay activists should focus on their own sins. Homophobia is a sin like lying, stealing and murder.<br>  <br>  It's the height of hypocrisy for those who scream "judicial activism" and "activist judges" every time a ruling does not go their way or is not "politically correct" in their eyes to criticize others in such a manner.

6GNqMJB4aa	Oh, I definitely see where you are coming from.  I have been in the same exact situation.  I tend to get nasty and sarcastic when I get pissed of too and I have done that to a coworker who was a pain in the butt.  She was obnoxious as hell and thought her sh*t did not stink. And then I reported her for always being a bossy, know-it-all. But as we all know, just because you are angry, you can't go around displaying your anger the way you did.  I say that from experience of also taking my anger out the same way you did.  If you act like that, people will view you as being in the wrong, even though you may have had a good reason to act the way you did.  I think that at some point you have to realize that these annoying a**ed coworkers aren't worth the hassle.  Even if they annoy you, just keep your head down and your eyes on your own work and ignore them like they don't exist.  Plain and simple.  I know how you feel about your parents.  When I told my mom about what I did, she took the company's side as well.  She always does that even though she knows how lousy some coworkers and customers can be.  But as I said, just learn how to control your anger.  That will be the key to your success at other jobs.  Because I have worked at some rinky dink places in my life and there were times when I would walk out in anger.  I yelled at a guy so violently at one  job because he thought the he could put me in my place simply because I was sick of him and no longer wanted to deal with him.  But after I walked out and thought about it, I realized that even though these people made me angry, I did not have to react the way that I did.  I could have kept my mouth shut and continued on with these jobs for a while so that I could have saved more money, instead of walking out and being left without a paycheck.|`|EXIjMTVcaa	Brian is absolutley right... you gotta make a stand to them and start countering them. I actually once took it too far with my mom and I was grounded for 3 months flat. No phone, no tv, no computer, no entertainment, no money! But it was worth it... always complare them to yourself, find out if they made any mistakes recently|`|OUrPPjcHaa	Remind your parents of their flaws if they won't stop. They point out how imperfect you are, just point out to them how imperfect they are. I'm sure they've messed up worse in their lifetime.|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	first of all that  is parents for you pointing out all the things we do wrong,  you just to hold your head up high, and try to find a job that you will like doing, look at your interest  start there,  and remember that you and others at work may or may not get alone, just pretend they are not there, and stay calm|`|ivejg4whaa	Hm, I can kind of relate to them because though you don't want to be walked all over, you have to keep your composure at work. Just because someone else is treating you like crap doesn't make it any better if you get nasty back. I think the best thing to do in situations like that is to report them to someone higher up, and if you can't do that, just notify them in a polite way that they will not talk to you like that anymore, you won't tolerate it.<br>  I don't see why your parents won't let you get another job though, that's odd. Crap happens, you live & you learn!|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	Who are they to not let you apply for another job???  The only way to better yourself is to try to get another job.

8qctM0B4aa	i agree|`|SrdIsAkTaa	No, I think its a matter of six of one half a dozen of the other.  Humans influence religion considerably but the Gods do on the other end as well.

2nRjy734aa	African-Americans are the biggest advocates for the classification of anyone with black blood or "black looks" as black ( <a href="http://bbsnews.net/article.php/20061222014017231" rel="nofollow">http://bbsnews.net/article.php/200612220...</a> ). They've gone as far as getting laws on the books that say a biracial foster child *must* be placed in a black family. <br>  <br>  They've been so successful at it, that most of society automatically labels anyone who is part black as black. Unfortunately, most of society is so programmed by these segregation efforts by blacks that they can, unfortunatley, no longer tell the difference between people like Alicia Keys and a black person, as biracial people are plastered on every black magazine out there. The claim by the black community that they "come in all colors" is a contradiction. The "they" means African. Africans are black-skinned people, not "high yellow", etc. The "many colors" comes from racial mixing, not "them". But, that doesn't mean all blacks are biracial, just as all races, decendants of Africans, are not black. Having a little bit of white blood is totally different than being the direct offspring of a white person.<br>  <br>  No matter how blacks want to slice it, their people, Africans, do not look like Alicia Keys. Put her next to Whoopi Goldberg, for example, someone who is no doubt black, and a 2-year-old could spot the difference. ( <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2aNq-JSS_w4/R8MpZGMWtsI/AAAAAAAADSA/ABJcP9O6z7k/s320/obamahalfsiblingscstfeelg7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_2aNq-JSS_w4/R8...</a> ) But blacks seek to claim the direct offspring of whites as "their people" so the differences most of society sees are unfortunately blurred. Ethiopian Africans are often cited as "blacks" with caucasian features and hair, but history shows they were integrated by Arab and Spanish invaders centuries ago. Northern Africans are also integrated with Arab blood. Honestly, I don't see how anybody could *not* see that Alicia Keys is biracial. But, she doesn't help any by promoting the segregational one-race "black" label.<br>  <br>  Besides the obvious non-African looks, there are cultural differences between mulattoes and blacks (most mulattoes are raised by a white parent). Blacks and biracial people are not synonymous. They are culturally and genetically different. Besides, it does not matter what Alicia Keys or Jennifer Beals look like. That does not change what they are. You do not have to "consider" either of them biraical. They ARE biracial. No matter what they choose to label themelves, they are just as much white as they are black.|`|AA11883252	I believe she identifies as a black woman. Black people come in many shades, from alabaster to deep ebony.|`|ckVewstIaa	because thats what she calls herself.<br>  <br>  she even said on the BET awards that "everybody wants to be like us"|`|57oHulIDaa	Alicia Keyes identifies more with her Black half than her White half.

UhtSE2B6aa	I appreciate your candor. However, I do like Al Sharpton (I can't say the same for Jesse Jackson). And yes, he's always in the news when he and others feel there is injustice done to the Black community or to an individual within the Black community, he's a civil rights activist - it's his job.<br>  <br>  And yes, we do have a Black president, but it would be foolish to think that racial profiling, discrimination, violence and other forms of racism are going to cease with the appointment of Obama. And besides, Al provides a platform to speak for individuals that otherwise do not have the medium to speak for themselves. If Al doesn't stand for some people, who else will?|`|JthubNIsaa	I don't even know what qualifies Sharpton to even be on TV or in public.

42cd4acabffe4ac20e83dff5bdbd7de0aa	That's exactly the concept I have an issue with. I'm not quite sure what religion I am, because of this very thought. If I were to believe in God, I'd be having faith in something that I have no proof it exists.<br>  <br>  I'm not certain any Gods actually exist, but I'm not certain they don't either. I guess my views are similar to those of an Agnostic; I believe right now, humans cannot be certain about anything that we do not have proof of. I believe that right now, it is impossible to know what is the "truth". And I say right now, because there is no evidence that God exists. But if God were to come to Earth in the form of a human and speak to us all, at that point I would change my opinion about his existence.<br>  <br>  That's why there are so many religions and variations on those religions - because there is no proof to them. If a god of a religion came to Earth, most people may change their beliefs based on this new evidence.<br>  <br>  I never understood how people could believe with certainty without a reason for it, or evidence to back it up.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I consider certain knowledge to be that knowledge that I hold with no significant doubt beyond that which I must have as an imperfect being.<br>  <br>  To be certain is not to claim that one has perfect knowledge.  Most people behave as if they are certain of a great many things.  We don't walk with any concern at all that gravity will suddenly cut out and leave us floating in space.  We are certain about gravity.  We are also certain about the suitability of the foods we eat - we don't worry that grapes and pizza might have become suddenly poisonous to us - we eat these things with certainty that they are safe.   People often deny that it is reasonable to have certain knowledge,  but their behavior shows that they actually are certain of a great many things. <br>  <br>  People operate with all kinds of certain knowledge.  It's not unusual to be certain of some things.  Indeed, it would be rather peculiar to be completely without any certain knowledge.   My Christian faith is based  in part on the overwhelming eyewitness testimony of the earliest Christians.   They suffered and even died to defend the Christian stories.   They reported that they knew Jesus before and after He was crucified,  and they were tortured because they told the Truth.   In my opinion,  that alone would be reasonable to substantiate certain knowledge.  I have other personal reasons for knowing that Jesus Christ exists.<br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic - I am certain of this.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	how can anyone say soomeone else doesnt have evidence b/c they havent seen or expereinced it? That statement in and of itself is silly. in case u dont realize it all evidence is not tangible.For instance, we can see evidence of love, but we cant give you love.. you will only see the affects of something not tangible!!!!.. You "thinkers" should realize by now that for tons of believers they have had some type of evidence. with that said, i know for certain , without any shadow of any doubt that GOD is real.. i cant prove this to you, nor do i feel obligated too.. Seek him as i did and get your own proof...<br>  <br>  From a former atheist now RADICAL 4 CHRIST!!!|`|fbrdhY1aaa	Because nobody ever said that to be certain of something, we had to prove it to everyone else.|`|JaKbiQd3aa	Hello,<br>  Im a christian, My definition of certainity would be that what i belive in, I believe it without a doubt, however some definitions or beliefs might suit people better, I think one univeral thing that any human being needs regardless of their belief  is something to hope for which  could give that individual a sense of certainty, or what they believe will happen.Take it or leave it this just my opinion.|`|Hq7RvcDFaa	think about a 1 year old child<br>  they are CERTAIN (without even a thought of what would happen otherwise) that their mother will provide for them, food, water, ect<br>  <br>  but in all reality, many mothers cannot even provide for themselves<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  us believers are just the same, depending on a god that might not even exist, you may call that dumb, but we call that faith<br>  <br>  god bless|`|K4xtdUQSaa	Because they take everything in the Bible as a truth, without even thinking about the persons who wrote it. It is just a book, writen by humans, but they use it as an evidence of God's existence.<br>  <br>  Here's te falacy: God exists because the Bible says it. The Bible was writen by God. You can continue that way till the end of time....|`|E2xG6bpnaa	Don't worry about it... some people believe without question because that is what they believe.  Others needed a document to prove it to them and others need more proof all together.  We all have to have faith in something... Why not God?|`|5Vh51eazaa	well just a stab at the dark but i am guessing that a lot of the Christians are gong to say "read the bible". ( witch means they haven't the bloodiest clue.)|`|RoqxGbgRaa	i guess for the same reason that some non-christians think that their non-christianity automatically makes them "thinkers."|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	With certainty I can claim that people either faith away from God or faith in God.<br>  <br>  But you have to see the Greek definitions of faith in order to understand the verb.<br>  <br>  The Spirit of God is God, and He is here on Earth. Jesus spoke of Him and I have experienced Him, and am experiencing Him. If God came to you and told you that His word was true in Christ, then you might be certain yourself. It doesn't make you right about everything, but it makes you right to Him.<br>  <br>  God wants the verb.

So think well! <br>  Sacrifice your short journey here- for in the hereafter you will have no fear. <br>  Two shoes of boiling fire he will wear- his brain will melt, his body will tear. <br>  The person will scream and will not know- this is only the lowest punishment, Allah will give. <br>  Day by day as our life decreases- day by day as our sins increase. <br>  Day by day as our deeds change into sins- another day the shaytan wins. <br>  For on that day when we’ll be scaled! <br>  Think- will we win or will we fail?<br>   laughing is the best medicina|`|H9DY3ElFaa	Me and my boyfriend were recently really sick, what worked for us was sucking on any hard candy, mints, cough drops, anything really.

Having faith in God is something that comes from within. You have to ignoring everything anyone else says and listen to what your heart is telling you, what feels right. True faith can not be swayed or hindered. <br>  <br>  I find that the more I talk to God, the more He seems to be listening. No, he doesn't give me everything I want. He can't. Watch "Bruce Almighty" it actually explains a lot. But when I pray things seem to happen for me. Some people will say that it's coincidence, and it's understandable to think that. But I don't. I can feel Him leading me when I ask to be led. It's not something I've been taught, it's something I feel because I reached out and asked Him for help, and He reached back and let me know He was there. <br>  <br>  Logically, I can see how people of no faith could see that as ridiculous--But I can't ignore what I feel in my heart.|`|f3ksTSNMaa	YES. I know from personal experience, from recieving small miracles to unbelievable ones, like when my new phone got drenched at a theme park, and i'd already cost my dad three phones, and yet the next day it just came on, no charger or anything...i have miracles like this everyday. I've known God since as long as i can remember, literally my best friend since i was like 5...he was that soothing, comforting voice in my head, always there. And even now, he helps me with things like school. Like the other day he warned me i had a pop quiz in GTchemistry. And he encourages me at my performances. Just things like that. So it doesn't have to be some philosiphical debate, just try and listen to him and you'll find out for yourself...|`|5744d400c7b6633cfb6929833cb9470daa	ABSOLUTELY  REAL   all  creation  testify  as  to  his  reality  look  at the  Bible  it  gives  ample  testimony  to  his  reality  gives  him a  name and a  personality  likes  and  dislikes  and  reason  for  all  things  and  has  shaped  the lives  of  billions  of  people  there  is  more  proof  he  exhists  than  there  is that  you  do|`|d6Y9N2p1aa	God is real, and he is a loving god.

EQVFlUbEaa	Neither. <br>  1. We can't dislike something we do not believe exists.<br>  2. Majority of the people who worship him are lovely people.<br>  <br>  I just dislike the religion and the stupidity that is caused by it.<br>  <br>  Edit to add to your details;<br>  Yes, i'd admire him. But I would not worship him. A decent person would not feel he requires worshipping to do good.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	How can I dislike something that doesn't exist?<br>  <br>  It happens to be that your "god" is a hateful tyrant, but it wouldn't make any difference if he was loving and just. He still doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  I don't dislike the people who worship their imaginary friend. But I do feel a bit sorry for their ignorance. I don't like to see people get brainwashed.<br>  <br>  What I dislike is the institution of religion itself. It's nothing more than a mind control cult, and it is responsible for more death and destruction than ANY other institution that has ever existed.|`|zQyslfHKaa	I don't dislike either.  I just dislike the religions that claim that humans deserve destruction and torture without a God.<br>  <br>  They are immoral.<br>  <br>  Try and understand that your question sounds like "Would you believe in Leprechauns if they weren't manic depressed?" to an Atheist.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in God, because there is no empirical evidense for his existence.  If there was, his nature wouldn't matter, I would HAVE to believe in him, which wouldn't effect my free will, because if he was as advertised in the bible, I still wouldn't worship him.  There is no plausible reason for him to remain hidden, other than non existence.|`|DDFgKxcaaa	I don't dislike things that don't exist; that would be as absurd as loving something that doesn't exist.|`|1WisnX8naa	Neither...<br>  <br>  I have no need to believe in a god. Especially one that has no evidence of even existing...  Christians doing bad things has nothing to do with it...|`|M6VcuiyDaa	"Would you admire a loving, just God, if he existed?"<br>  <br>  Perhaps, though I have not met many people who worship such a god.|`|PwD3slrTaa	They despise Him, just as the ugly loathe the beautiful.|`|On5B8U3faa	How can you hate something that doesn't (you don't believe to) exist???|`|AAAw24KOaa	I don't believe in the gods, so I obviously cannot dislike them.<br>  <br>  But secondarily, I don't dislike theists, generally.  I strongly disagree with many of their assertions and proposed moral concepts.<br>  <br>  Who said I was filled with hatred?  Occasionally, I get frustrated (far different than "filled with hatred") but I rarely express that here.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	I don't dislike anyone. I just don't believe all the hearsay that's in the bible because God created everything supposively....so he should have been able to get the message out himself. To each their own though. I was raised Christian, but if there were a God, he would stop all of the evil in this world...period. I believe religion is manmade and people only believe so they have something to look forward to when they die instead of knowing they'll just be dead just like an ant that was stepped on....dead and gone. It's as simple as that. Religion is a cult and most people who are going to church every sunday are doing it to cover up their bad deeds or feel better about all the crap they pull throughout the week. I say, treat everyone how you want to be treated and you don't need religion to know that.|`|74b388eca668facf7bdd1f57af916ab9aa	I do not hate "God" the same as I do not hate leprechauns or unicorns.  It does not exist, so I cannot hate it.  I hate a lot of what the mythical God represents, though.<br>  <br>  I also do not dislike theists.  I do not like the fact that it is taboo to question one's belief in a god and his or her morality as it relates to that belief.  The religious are the one group that is above scrutiny for the wicked and flat out dick things that it does because "it is part of their faith".  <br>  <br>  I dislike religion because it takes the intellectual low road, coping out to fantasy and human desire rather than pursuing the truth and forcefully attacks whosoever speaks out against it, which in turn leads to people blowing themselves up in the marketplace and wishing for nuclear bombs to go off because it will make Jesus rise from the dead.  That's insane and dangerous.  No, I don't care if its "just what you believe", you should be medicated and isolated from the rest of society, because you are a threat to humanity.<br>  <br>  If we were in a different reality, I would have no more trouble admiring a loving god than I do admiring Abraham Lincoln or Mother Teresa.  On the flip side, I don't admire Superman, because he does not exist.  My biggest fear is that in 2000 years, people will be praying to Clark Kent.|`|8ACyJTNgaa	There is nothing to dislike about God because he is just an idea,<br>  I only dislike the crazy hate filled evangelicals or those who try to prove his existence.<br>  I would be a different person, but I would definitely admire a "loving" god if he existed.|`|5Vh51eazaa	i don't like the idea of god as he stands today. if he was loving and not all the hate we seem to get out of gods fan clubs than yes i would love god. but if he was just as vengeful and hating as he is described in the bible and how we fallow i would yes hate god. but i don't think that god is like that if he is out there.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	If he/she was loving and deserving sure.  Unfortunately, the one explained to me is not, amd most of us don't dislike the believers we just disagree - many of us were there before we saw religion for what it is.|`|E2xG6bpnaa	I am a former Atheist and I think the reason I stayed Atheist so long is because I was damned by Christians so much. A loving God is something that I believe in now but if I was still Atheist why would it make a difference?|`|0ALinE42aa	Sure, but there's no such thing as any kind of god.|`|EtMW3RY0aa	"atheists don't dislike god cus they don't believe in him"|`|n3Ukmu3yaa	I could care less. <br>  <br>  God hasn't given me crap lately.|`|6xaMstLsaa	How in the blue hell can you hate something that you don't think even exists?|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	If you can't understand the concept that a person could possibly simply not believe in it, than your mind is rather limited.<br>  <br>  I am neutral about your god, I don't care.|`|4yg7zZZ2aa	Neither. I dislike immoral polices, discrimination, hate and violence that either <br>  <br>  a) some people with good intentions but who are truly ignorant think they are in "God's will" while doing.<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  b) people hiding behind their religion, to justify those actions by saying they are "God's will".<br>  <br>  That's what I dislike.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	ATHEIST -  someone who does not believe in a God – any God – not just the Christian one.  But that does not mean they do not hold strong moral or religious beliefs!.<br>  <br>  It is therefore illogical to suggest that they could hate something which they do not believe exists!!<br>  <br>  Bu just try reading a small sample of Christian postings on here!!!<br>  <br>  Intolerant, egotistical, hate filled and bigoted!! Eschewing education, science, evolution works of fiction and much, much more. Christians are the only religion opposing human rights and persecuting gays, pro choice and so much more - but far worse whilst they demand freedom of religion they deny it to all non Christians and persecute them!!!<br>  <br>  Gandhi had it absolutely right when he observed, “I like your Christ; I do not like your Christians. They are so unlike your Christ”!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Except of course that all the evidence says christ never existed!!<br>  <br>  There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!<br>  <br>  He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?<br>  <br>  Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!<br>   <br>  Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!<br>  <br>  At best he was an amalgam of those others!!|`|9z5NASypaa	Its not that I dislike god, its that I dont believe in god. How can I dislike something that I dont believe in?<br>  The only time I dont like Christians is when they try and ram their religon down my throat.<br>  I have friends that are Christian and I dont hate them.|`|4405cb5dd585bee70aeaf6a964ff0b94aa	A real Atheist just doesn't believe, end of story.

ErXKMHGAaa	I cry when I am really, really angry. I can't help it. This in turn makes me angry at myself, and it all blows up in a complete meltdown.<br>  <br>  It takes a lot to make me angry though.<br>  <br>  I have caught myself shedding a tear or two when my kids do sweet sentimental things for me such as make me a card, or my son will say "I love you sweet mommy!" - that one gets me every time.<br>  <br>  I don't usually cry when I'm sad though, I have always been the "rock" for my family and friends. I did cry at my best friend's funeral though, but mainly because I was so angry at him for giving up at such a young age (29) leaving three young kids (8yrs, 5yrs, and 2yrs)...I'm over it now.<br>  <br>  The last time I saw my husband cry was when our daughter and son were born (separate occasions). And before that, when his mother passed - for weeks. I made a scrapbook for him of pictures of his mother from birth to our wedding (she passed 7 months afterward), he gets a little weepy when he looks at it, and rightly so.|`|StRaKUf6aa	Feelings of inadequacy.

pb1CcCbXaa	I'd say give him fair warning. Come up with some clever come back or just tell him how you feel. And if they dont cut it out, then sometimes some people do need to be shook up a little. I have never found any satifactory in telling teachers or adults. You can stand up for yourself ^^<br>  <br>  <br>    (When I was in school my freshman year there was some douche bag who was just rude to me. He was like obsessed with me. He constantly made horrible sexual comments about me. Or touched himself in the middle of class wile saying my name. It was discusting. And I was the "sweet" quiet girl who no one paid any attention to. The teacher acted like she didnt even notice. Ugh. -_- some ppl. And the rest of the class would laugh along. Finally, I met him by the lockers and told him to cut it out! He looked freaked. He tried to act it off as if he wasn't scared, but he stopped for a couple weeks after that. Well, he started it up again and I intended on atleast hitting him- unfortunately I ended up getting pissed off at some other **** and left school before I did. I wish all the time that I had stayed just to see the expression on his face. Oh well- give your story a better ending.

If you despised someone so much, why focus all your energy into that person?  Makes more sense to sit back and read a book or do something you enjoy.  I always confer with people about how I hate pork and am disgusted by it.  As a result, when I go to the grocery store, I avoid the pork section in the meat aisle.

And there will be some people who will stay near the side of a mountain and in the evening their shepherd will come to them with their sheep and ask them for something, but they will say to him, 'Return to us tomorrow.' Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will transform the rest of them into monkeys and pigs and they will remain so till the Day of Resurrection." <br>  <br>   <br>  Muslim :: Book 24 : Hadith 5279 <br>  Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: The bell is the musical instrument of the Satan<br>  <br>  “And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allaah…” [Luqmaan 31:6] <br>  <br>  “[Allaah said to Iblees:] And befool them gradually those whom you can among them with your voice (i.e. songs, music, and any other call for Allaah’s disobedience)…” [al-Israa’ 17:64] <br>  <br>  The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: <br>  <br>   “Among my ummah there will certainly be people who permit zinaa, silk, alcohol and musical instruments…” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari ta’leeqan, no. 5590; narrated as mawsool by al-Tabaraani and al-Bayhaqi.

The fact that I can waste a lot of time just listening to music instead of listening to Quran is one of the obvious reasons. Apart from that, it takes up time when I should be reading Quran. And it can sometimes interfere with prayers, like it takes my concentration off it, and the only way I was able to see that is each time I've tried to stop listening to music.<br>  <br>  BUT, I do still listen to music.

Music has spread to such an extent that it is afflicting every muslim in this modern era. Today, individuals are being confronted by a situation where one is forced to listen to music whether by choice or without. Music is played in nearly all department stores and super markets. Even whilst walking in the streets, we find cars blaring with music. No matter which direction we go, we are blasted with music. The increasing popularity of music, which is prevalent in our society poses a tremendous danger for muslims. <br>  <br>  <br>  MUSIC IS HARAM<br>  References within the context of the Holy Qur'aan along with the Hadith of the Prophet Sallalahu alihi wa sallam (Peace be upon him) confirm that music is haraam. <br>  <br>  Interpreters of the Qur'aan have defined the term 'lahwal hadith' which is mentioned in the Qur'aan as: <br>   1) Singing and listening to songs. <br>   2) Purchasing of male and female singers. <br>   3) Purchase of instruments of fun and amusement. <br>  <br>  When Sayyidana Abdullah Ibne Mas'ood radiyallahu Anhu (Allah be pleased with him), a very close companion of our Prophet Sallalahu alihi wa sallam (Peace be upon him) was asked about the meaning of the term 'lahwal hadith', he replied<br>  <br>  “I swear by Him besides whom there is no other God,that it refers to ghinaa (singing ).”<br>  <br>  This statement, he repeated three times. This view is unanimously supported by the four Khalifas, the eminent Sahabaah, Tabi..een, the four Imaams and other reliable Islaamic scholars and authorities. One hadith from the Bukhari Shareef, the most authentic Book of Hadith, further confirms unlawfulness of music and singing :<br>  <br>  "There will be people of my Ummah who will seek to make lawful; fornication, wine-drinking and the use of ma'aazif ( musical instruments )."<br>  <br>  <br>  Detailed analysis of the arabic word 'ma'aazif ' shows that it refers to musical instruments, the sounds of those musical instruments and singing with the accompaniment of instruments. Closer analysis of the wordings of the Hadith establishes the prohibition of music. Firstly, the words 'seek to make lawful shows that music is not permissible, as logically one can only seek to make lawful that which is not allowed. Secondly, if music was not prohibited, then it would not have been brought within the same context as fornication and wine-drinking. <br>  <br>  MUSIC - ITS EFFECTS<br>  Muslims are aware that nothing has been prohibited by Allah except that which is harmful to the welfare of a Muslim individual and the society as a whole. The divine attribute behind the prohibition of music can be comprehended by looking into the diverse influence music can have. Experiments carried out by doctors and professors have confirmed that the music of today is such that it does not only affect the brain, but each and every organ of one's body. There is a close relationship between music and bodily movements. We find that people listening to music automatically start tapping their fingers and feet, as if the music is permeating in their blood.<br>  <br>  It is also proved that music affects one's emotions, increases arousal in terms of alertness and excitement and also leads to various physiological changes in the person. In a psychology experiment, it was found that listening to moderate type of music increased one..s normal heart beat, whilst listening to rock music the heart beat increased even further, yet people claim that music has no effect. <br>  It is a very ignorant and misguided attitude to percieve music as a form of pleasure and passing of time, since the messages of today's music follow a general theme of love, fornication, drugs and freedom. We find that the whole world is obsessed with the kufr idea of freedom, i.e. freedom of speech, freedom of movement, etc. In modern schools and universities, we observe independence, free expression and secular thinking being encouraged. This idea of freedom, “ It's my life, I'll do what I want” is a predominant, underlying theme of today's music. It is being used as a means for drilling those modern ideologies that are totally contrary to Islamic Shariah and values, into the minds of Muslims. One should abstain from evil audacities such as listening to music and encourage others to do the same too. <br>  <br>  MAY ALMIGHTY ALLAH GUIDE US ALL TO THE STRAIGHT PATH - AMEEN.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  I read some article in Science News that it's proven by dr.Brian Primack from University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine that rude words of songs and music in many situations encourage young people for early sexual initiation. <br>  <br>  Salam alaykum wa rahmatuh allah wa barakatuh <br>  Marta|`|0HYUNxlnaa	Is music haram?  <br>  Answered by  Sheikh Muhammad Ali Al-Hanooti  <br>  Answer Among the entertainments, which may comfort the soul, please the heart, and refresh the ear is singing. <br>  Islam permits singing under the condition that it is not in any way obscene or harmful to Islamic morals. There is no harm in its being accompanied by music, which is not exciting. In order to create an atmosphere of joy and happiness, singing is recommended on festive occasions such as the days of 'Eid, weddings and wedding feasts, births, 'aqiqat (the celebration of the birth of a baby by the slaughter of sheep), and on the return of a traveler. <br>  'Aishah narrated that when a woman was married to an Ansari man, the Prophet (peace be on him) said, " 'Aishah, did they have any entertainment? The Ansar are fond of entertainment.'' (Reported by al-Bukhari.) Ibn 'Abbas said, " 'Aishah gave a girl relative of hers in marriage to a man of the Ansar. The Prophet (peace be on him) came and asked, 'Did you send a singer along with her?' 'No,' said 'Aishah. The Messenger of Allah (peace be on him) then said, The Ansar are a people who love poetry. You should have sent along someone who would sing, 'Here we come, to you we come, greet us as we greet you.' " (Reported by Ibn Majah.) <br>  'Aishah narrated that during the days of Mina, on the day of 'Eid al-Adha, two girls were with her, singing and playing on a hand drum. The Prophet (peace be on him) was present, listening to them with his head under a shawl. Abu Bakr then entered and scolded the girls. The Prophet (peace be on him), uncovering his face, told him, "Let them be, Abu Bakr. These are the days of 'Eid." (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim.) In his book, Ihya ulum al-deen, (In the quarter on "Habits", in the book Listening to Singing.), Imam al-Ghazzali mentions the ahadith about the singing girls, the Abyssinians playing with spears in the Prophet's Mosque, the Prophet's encouraging them by saying, "Carry on, O Bani Arfidah," his asking his wife, 'Aishah, "Would you like to watch?" and standing there with her until she herself became tired and went away, and 'Aishah's playing with dolls with her friends. He then says: Al-Bukhari and Muslim in the two Sahihs report all these ahadith, and they clearly prove that singing and playing are not haram. <br>  From them we may deduce the following: <br>  First: The permissibility of playing; the Abyssinians were in the habit of dancing and playing. <br>  Second: Doing this in the mosque. <br>  Third: The Prophet's saying, 'Carry on, O Bani Arfidah,' was a command and a request that they should play; then how can their play be considered haram? <br>  Fourth: The Prophet (peace be on him) prevented Abu Bakr and 'Umar from interrupting and scolding the players and singers. He told Abu Bakr that 'Eid was a joyous occasion and that singing was a means of enjoyment. <br>  Fifth: On both occasions he stayed for a long time with 'Aishah, letting her watch the show of the Abyssinians and listening with her to the singing of the girls. This proves that it is far better to be good-humored in pleasing women and children with games than to express such disapproval of such amusements out of a sense of harsh piety and asceticism. <br>  Sixth: The Prophet (peace be on him) himself encouraged 'Aishah by asking her, "Would you like to watch?" (Reported by al-Bukhari and Muslim.) <br>  Seventh: The permissibility of singing and playing on the drum... and what follows, to the end of al-Ghazzali's discussion on singing. <br>  <br>  It is reported that many Companions of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased with them) as well as second-generation Muslim scholars used to listen to singing and did not see anything wrong with it. As for the ahadith, which have been reported against singing, they are all weak and have been shown by researchers to be unsound. <br>  The jurist Abu Bakr al-'Arabi says, "No sound hadith is available concerning the prohibition of singing," while Ibn Hazm says, "All that is reported on this subject is false and fabricated " However, since singing is in many cases associated with drinking parties and nightclubs, many scholars have declared it to be haram or at least makruh. They state that singing constitutes that kind of idle talk which is mentioned in the ayah, And among the people is the one who buys idle talk (at the expense of his soul) in order to lead (people) astray from the path of Allah without knowledge, holding it in mockery; for such there will be a humiliating punishment. (31:6) Says Ibn Hazm: This verse condemns a particular behavior, that of doing something to mock the path of Allah. Anyone who does this is an unbeliever; if he even should buy a copy of the Qur'an, doing so in order to make it the object of his mockery and thereby leading people astray, he would be an unbeliever. It is this type of behavior, which is condemned by Allah and not the idle talk in which one may indulge for mere relaxation, without intending to lead people astray from the path of Allah. <br>  Ibn

I think it was Sigmund Freud who proposed that humans are actually bisexual. Why do things always have to be 100% of something? Maybe some are born so, and some develop the ability through experience. Maybe some are more apt than others for sexual feelings, other than heterosexuality, to form. Here's another thought: in this society we are instilled that boys generally like girls and boys generally like boys, and though some people didn't choose to be homosexual, they choose to follow that lifestyle as opposed to what society believes. Stereotypes have made it rather murky.<br>  <br>  One thing that is for certain is that even in nature there are animals who engage in homosexual acts. I suppose it's all about being different, especially humans, whose minds are very complex.<br>  <br>  If everyone is indeed bisexual, or neutral, then hetero is not the default. Experience alters things, and people don't entirely chose how their lifestyles will be.There is one fact so far, and that is that there is variations in sexual preferences, everything else so far is theory.<br>  <br>  here's some other stuff:<br>  <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14969/14969-h/14969-h.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14969/149...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bibliomania.com/1/7/68/1962/frameset.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bibliomania.com/1/7/68/1962/f...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.matthewckeller.com/Zietsch_HomosexualityEvolution_2008.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.matthewckeller.com/Zietsch_Ho...</a><br>  <a href="http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/157/11/1843" rel="nofollow">http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/cont...</a><br>  <br>  not sure if this will help, but some people are so conditioned to follow society's expectations that they supress homosexuals acts the doc's called Middle Sexes (find the rest on google):<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy-7AoxFEJA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy-7AoxFE...</a>|`|ZvU093GPaa	that's because it is not only gen tics but it is also your environment as well. one thing that helps determine it is your first kiss. if it is with a person of the same sex and your brain decides that it is a good thing than you will lean to word that way. however if your brain decides it is wrong you will go to a regular streight  sexual relationship|`|jJxUCkkFaa	it is probably from many factors genetic,hormonal, environmental and psychological and i am bi.

Pheromones are the hormones that trigger your mind when someone you are attracted to is close and turned on, or even just close. so if a lesbian were next to a girl she was attracted to, and that girl was turned on, the chemicals(pheromones) she is exerting is being carried to the first girl, which spurs a chemical reaction, which turns you on. This is why the scent of your lover is so appealing- pheromones are carried in scent. So it is not a choice, because your pheromones are not something you call into action. <br>  good luck!|`|mkN97aYHaa	I perceive homosexuality as a form of hate speech.  If you look closely at the tenets of various racist and sexist ideologies and compare them to the doctrines of homosexual groups, then you will find that homosexual groups tend to have a lot of eerie parallels with racist and sexist ideologies.  I am not sure if they are aware of their viewpoints or not, but if they are completely unaware of their behavior, then it could have very well been just an unfortunate coincidence.  Some groups, however, like the Nazis and the Roman Empire, among others in the past, and some groups like certain white power or neo Nazi organizations, have openly expressed homosexual behavior and they have hated people for their race and sometimes their gender.  As for the Nazis, there was a dispute between the "butch" and "femme" sections of homosexuality (which covers both male and female homosexuality).  The majority of the Nazi hierarchy was rumored to be homosexual, bisexual, transgendered and, if it was possible back in those days, transsexual.  The majority of the homosexual Nazis were in the butch camp and they tended to view the femmes, that is, the people that worked at the Sex Research Institute in Berlin, as inferiors and they often had them as sexual slaves.  Of course, explaining things like this would take forever, so I fail to see the logic of anyone that would want to hate Christians and Jews like the Nazis did, among others, and be forced to accept another form of intolerance that has the ironic nerve, gall, and arrogance to see itself as form of tolerance, acceptance, and love.  To me, it smacks purely of intolerance, hypocrisy, bigotry, prejudice, racism, sexism, and just plain elitism.|`|aW5uShwtaa	That is a good question. I don't think it's genetic.

Just how like twins aren't both left handed or both right handed; not all twins are going to both straight or both gay.|`|NWopkX4baa	One may be suppressing their sexuality in order to please others. You can never really know.|`|psUL6906aa	Tegan and Sara... identical twins who are both lesbians. Genetic perhaps?|`|lxLeeYA5aa	Although identical twins share the same DNA, not everything is exact. Take height for example, an identical twin may grow to be a little taller than the other. Perhaps this is possible with the gene for sexual orientation?<br>  This is pretty long, but may help support you're answer..<br>  "Identical twins look so much alike because they share the same genetic material – DNA. Yet, if you look closely, you will see differences, in height, or in the number of freckles, etc. To answer why, let’s compare identical twins to apple pies made from the same recipe. When you take the pies out of the stove, each pie will turn out a little different even though they have exactly the same ingredients. Differences in the environment make it impossible for each apple pie to be exactly the same – perhaps the stove was a little hotter while one was cooking, or they were removed from the oven at different times, etc. <br>  So identical twins are like two pies made from the same recipe. They are more similar than they are different, yet they will always have some physical differences due to differences in their environment. <br>  <br>  You may have heard the phrase “nature vs. nurture” before, but what exactly does it mean? Two things are responsible for making us who we are: Nature and Nurture. Our genes (nature) are important, but they are not the whole story. Our environment (nurture) also plays a big role. <br>  <br>  By environment we mean things like what we eat, how much we sleep, whether get sick and when illness occurs. These are things that happen during our life that also have an impact on who we are and what we look like. <br>  <br>  Some identical twins can have different heights and weights. This is because height and weight are not only controlled by our DNA, but also by what we eat, illness and other environmental factors. And differences in diet can start before twins are even born! When the twins are growing inside the uterus, there can be differences in how well they connect to the placenta. This can mean one twin starts getting more to eat even before they take their first breath. <br>  <br>  Another physical difference between identical twins is their fingerprints. The fingerprints of identical twins do look more similar than the fingerprints of non-twins. But they are not exactly the same. They have differences that a fingerprint expert can use to tell them apart. This is because environmental differences like how the hand of the fetus touches the amniotic sac also affect fingerprints. <br>  <br>  So now we know why identical twins can be different heights. This means height can’t be controlled by genes alone, because identical twins have the same genes. Therefore, height must be part nature and part nurture. On the other hand, identical twins almost always have the same eye color. So eye color must be mostly nature. <br>  <br>  Many things seem to be controlled by a little of both. This means no matter how similar two people’s DNA is, each will always be unique. "

Which is not to say you're not gothic, just that upon first glance, you probably would not be seen that way. <br>  <br>  I think what you're doing is awesome. The fact that you don't dress a certain way just to fit in with the scene you're most compatible with. You don't need a label - just be yourself :)|`|GDbTG9oCaa	I think that you are G.E.=Goth and Emo.  Goth's don't really like pink or white, but emo's do.  (P.S.

Goth's also love blood and death, and wear mostly skirts (in girl).  I shop at SoHo (Really good shopping center in London) often because its got the best emo, goth and punk clothing.

If you would consider yourself goth, then that's pretty much done and done. Goth itself is practically dead, so its more likely you would be considered emo or dark. Goth usually refers to those who truly don't conform, have little discretion for authority, and, yes, listen to metal and wear chains/black. Still, your explication of yourself sounds more like one of a pseudo-goth, so I, personally would consider you emo. Every person seems to have a different idea about the meaning of a word such as goth, though, so different people might consider you goth. Overall, most people would probably think of you as emo, however, so no, you aren't really goth.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	You sound EMO/metal!  I listen to loads of Alternative, EBM, Industrial, Death Rock, trad Goth.  Like a great many other people with similar tastes, I'm not at all depressed, solitary or introverted.

Your statement describes your actions as the very closely similar behavior you detest in others.  So, is it possible for you to help those who could very likely appreciate discussing the class lecture.  Most people who have high intolerance for others are actually very fearful of being disclosed as ersatz.  Just relax, think good thoughts, and understand that life is a learning opportunity.|`|743fefee670c746380c4e67fe325cdfeaa	Well, there is a great difference between people who annoy you and people you hate. Hate is such a strong word, one that I rarely use (I use it about as often that I use love- not just romantic). When you hate someone, everything about them repulses you. Their appearance, their beliefs, their behaviors: everything. I myself know many people who annoy me at some point or another, but I still enjoy being with them. All the reasons you listed for hating a person are a little over the top, with all due respect. Honestly, I am surprised you do not hate yourself. <br>  <br>  The way to eliminate this hate is to see the good in people. Sure, maybe your friend cannot understand the lecture as well as you can, but that same friend just might know a little more about something else that is more important. You have to give people a chance to shine. Some don't, but many do in their own special way. Find the good, pay less attention to the bad unless is DIRECTLY affects you, and my friend, I believe you will fare better in your personal relationships. :)

LZF76BLXaa	A) Advaitics use the term Iswar and never Bhagavan. There are only two having this iswar title, Parameswaran (or Maheswaran) and Saniswaran. Lord Siva is called as Iswara, Parabrahma and Hirangarbha. <br>  <br>  Vishnu is called as Bhagavan, Parabrahma and Hirangarbha. <br>  <br>  This may be due to some convention only to avoid confusion. Iswar and Bhagavan both mean Parabrahmam and only differ in USAGE!<br>  <br>  -------------------------  -------------------------  -------------------------  -------------------------<br>  (i) Palasruti of Vishnu Sahasranama:<br>  <br>  The term 'Iswara ovacha' is used for lord Parameswara and the term 'Bhagavan ovacha' is used for Lord Krishna.  <br>  -------------------------  -------------------------  -------------------------  -------------------------<br>  <br>  (ii) Bhagavad Gita:<br>  <br>  Shree Bhagwan (ovacha) said:<br>  <br>  7.4 " Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind reason and also ego; these constitute My nature eight fold divided. This indeed is My lower (material) nature. <br>   <br>  7.5 The other than this, by which the whole universe is sustained, know it to be My higher (or spiritual) nature in the form of jiva (the life principle), O Arjuna."<br>  <br>  Lord  Krishna describes the maya as two kinds - para prakriti and apara prakriti here. Apara is of the lower form and para is of the higher form; Apara prakriti is karana for the jagat and para prakriti is the karana for the jIvas. Brahman is therefore the karana for the creation, sustenance and dissolution of jagat.<br>  <br>  ISWARA:<br>  <br>  Brahman associated with the upadi of maya is called by several names like ISWARA, Parabrahma and Hiranyagarbha.<br>  <br>  Iswara, literally, the Supreme Lord) — According to Advaita Vedanta, when man tries to know the attributeless Brahman with his mind, under the influence of Maya, Brahman becomes the Lord. Iswara is Brahman with Maya — the manifested form of Brahman. <br>  <br>  Adi Shankara uses a metaphor that when the "reflection" of the Cosmic Spirit falls upon the mirror of Maya, it appears as the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is true only in the pragmatic level — his actual form in the transcendental level is the Cosmic Spirit.<br>  <br>  Iswara is Saguna Brahman or Brahman with innumerable auspicious qualities. He is all-perfect, omniscient, omnipresent, incorporeal, independent, Creator of the world, its ruler and also destroyer. He is causeless, eternal and unchangeable — and is yet the material and the instrumental cause of the world. He is both immanent (like whiteness in milk) and transcendent (like a watch-maker independent of a watch). He may be even regarded to have a personality. He is the subject of worship. He is the basis of morality and giver of the fruits of one's Karma. However, He himself is beyond sin and merit. <br>  <br>  He rules the world with his Maya — His divine power. This association with a "false" knowledge does not affect the perfection of Ishvara, in the same way as a magician is himself not tricked by his magic. However, while Ishvara is the Lord of Maya and she (ie, Maya) is always under his control, the living beings (jīva, in the sense of humans) are the servants of Maya (in the form of ignorance). This ignorance is the cause of the unhappiness and sin in the mortal world. While Ishvara is Infinite Bliss, humans are miserable. Ishvara always knows the unity of the Brahman substance, and the Mayic nature of the world.<br>  <br>  BHAGAVAN:<br>  <br>  With the upadi of bhaga, Brahman is also called BHAGAVAN. Bhaga is a combination of six qualities, which are jnyana (omniscience), bala (omnipotence), aishvarya (lordship), shakti (creative power), virya (immutability) and tejas (splendour). <br>  <br>  Iswara, bhagavan are synonymous terms - bhaga as an upadhi is not generally used in the advaita context (it is folded in maya).<br>  <br>  B) The essential nature of Iswara is truth, knowledge, infiniteness, happiness and purity. He is present everywhere. He knows everything.<br>  <br>  He possesses six qualities and that is why He is called Bhagavan. Bhaga in Sanskrit means good quality.<br>  <br>  These are: 1) Knowledge 2) Lordship 3) Strength 4) Valour 5) Energy and 6) Splendour.<br>  <br>  C) 'Bhagavan' term is also prefixed to noble souls like  Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharishi,  Sri Bhagavan Nityananda, Bhagavan Sri Aravindar and others.|`|UqgCazhGaa	731022BG.BOM                 Lectures<br>     So the other body, which is described here, Paramatma... We are atma, and He is Paramatma. We are isvara; He is Paramesvara. We are not Paramesvara. We are Brahman, He is Parabrahman. This "param" word is used. But sometimes men with little intelligence, they cannot distinguish between Paramatma and atma, Paramesvara and isvara. Here another word is used, bhokta mahesvarah. We are not bhokta. We are trying to become bhokta, or enjoyer, but we are becoming baffled. It is not possible. We cannot become bhokta. We can become being enjoyed, predominated, not the predominator. Just like one thing is enjoyed and the other is enjoyer. The Supreme Lord, He is the enjoyer. Bhoktaram yajna-tapasam sarva-loka-mahesvaram.<br>     The same word again, mahesvara. Maha isvara. Maha means great. Isvara means controller. So we can controller a few men, but Mahesvara means He controls all living entities. Nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam. We may be very proud of controlling a factory, a few thousands of workers, but we are not Mahesvara. The Mahesvara is Krsna, Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is in His Paramatma feature, is situated in every body. Paramatmeti ca apy ukto dehe 'smin, asmin dehe, within this body. It is also discussed that... What is that? Sarva-ksetresu bharata. What is that? No. There is a... All right.<br>     So Paramatma, there are two souls. Ksetra-jna. Ksetra, ksetra-jna. The Arjuna's questions, I think, in this chapter. Ksetra-jnam capi mam viddhi sarva-ksetresu bharata. Krsna says that "I am also ksetra-jna." The body is ksetra, and the soul if ksetra-jna, one who knows about the body. Just like you have got your body, I have got my body. And I know it is my body, you know it is your body. Just like your apartment, your living room. Similarly, there is another partner. That is Krsna, Paramatma. Ksetra-jnam capi mam viddhi. I can take care of my body. I am the owner of this body. But Krsna is the owner of all bodies.<br>     Just like the landlord and the tenant--the tenant is the occupier and the landlord is the owner--similarly, I am the occupier of this body, and Krsna, Paramatma, He is the owner of this body. This is knowledge. I am not the owner of this body. Therefore Krsna's another name is Hrsikesa. Hrsika means the senses. We are claiming, "This is my hand," but this is not my hand. This is Krsna's hand. The same thing. The tenant may occupy the room, but he is not the owner of the room. Owner is different person. Similarly, we may occupy this body or any body, but we are not owner of this body. As soon as we know that "I am not owner of this body, I am the occupier of the body," that is knowledge. We are falsely claiming that "We are owner of the body." We are not owner of the body. I cannot therefore repair anything. If any part of my limb of my body goes wrong, I do not know how to repair it. But Krsna can do it because He is the owner, Hrsikesa. Hrsikesa. Hrsikena hrsikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate. You have to pay to the owner. Similarly, we have to serve Krsna for occupying this body. That is devotion. Yajnarthe karmano 'nyatra loko 'yam karma-bandhanah.<br>  <br>  Bg 2.2 P          Contents of the Gita Summarized<br>     The Sanskrit word bhagavan is explained by the great authority, Parasara Muni, the father of Vyasadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagavan. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only Krsna can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahma, Lord Siva, or Narayana, can possess opulences as fully as Krsna. Therefore it is concluded in the Brahma-samhita by Lord Brahma himself that Lord Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavan, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.<br>  <br>    isvarah paramah krsnah sac-cid-ananda-vigrahah<br>    anadir adir govindah sarva-karana-karanam<br>  <br>     "There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavan, but Krsna is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes." (Brahma-samhita 5.1)<br>     In the Bhagavatam also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Krsna is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:<br>  <br>    ete camsa-kalah pumsah krsnas tu bhagavan svayam<br>    indrari-vyakulam lokam mrdayanti yuge yuge<br>  <br>     "All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself." (Bhag. 1.3.28)<br>     Therefore, Krsna is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman.<br>  <br>  SSR 1            Learning the Science of the Self<br>     Parasara Muni, a great sage and the father of Vyasadeva, who compiled all the Vedic literatures, gave the following definition of God:<br>                        <br>                       aisvaryasya samagrasya<br>                       viryasya yasasah sriyah<br>                       jnana-vairagyayos caiva<br>                        sannam bhaga itingana<br>  <br>                                               (Visnu Purana 6.5.47)<br>     Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is thus defined by Parasara Muni as one who is full in six opulences--who has full strength, fame, wealth, knowledge, beauty, and renunciation.<br>     Bhagavan, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the proprietor of all riches. There are many rich men in the world, but no one can claim that he possesses all the wealth. Nor can anyone claim that no one is richer than he. We understand from the Srimad-Bhagavatam, however, that when Krsna was present on this earth He had 16,108 wives, and each wife lived in a palace made of marble and bedecked with jewels. The rooms were filled with furniture made of ivory and gold, and there was great opulence everywhere. These descriptions are all given vividly in the Srimad-Bhagavatam. In the history of human society we cannot find anyone who had sixteen thousand wives or sixteen thousand palaces. Nor did Krsna go to one wife one day and another wife another day. No, He was personally present in every palace at the same time. This means that He expanded Himself in 16,108 forms. This is impossible for an ordinary man, but it is not very difficult for God. If God is unlimited, He can expand Himself in unlimited forms, otherwise there is no meaning to the word unlimited. God is omnipotent; He can maintain not only sixteen thousand wives but sixteen million and still encounter no difficulty, otherwise there is no meaning to the word omnipotent.<br>     These are all attractive features. We experience in this material world that if a man is very rich, he is attractive. In America, for instance, Rockefeller and Ford are very attractive because of their riches. They are attractive even though they do not possess all the wealth of the world. How much more attractive, then, is God, who is the possessor of all riches.<br>     Similarly, Krsna has unlimited strength. His strength was present from the moment of His birth. When Krsna was only three months old, the Putana demon attempted to kill Him, but instead she was killed by Krsna. That is God. God is God from the beginning. He does not become God by some meditation or mystic power. Krsna is not that type of God. Krsna was God from the very beginning of His appearance.<br>     Krsna also has unlimited fame. Of course, we are devotees of Krsna and know of Him and glorify Him, but apart from us, many millions in the world are aware of the fame of the Bhagavad-gita. In all countries all over the world the Bhagavad-gita is read by philosophers, psychologists, and religionists. We are also finding very good sales with our Bhagavad-gita As It Is. This is because the commodity is pure gold. There are many editions of the Bhagavad-gita, but they are not pure. Ours is selling more because we are presenting the Bhagavad-gita as it is. The fame of the Bhagavad-gita is Krsna's fame.<br>     Beauty, another opulence, is possessed unlimitedly by Krsna. Krsna Himself is very beautiful, as are all His associates. Those who were pious in a previous life receive an opportunity in this material world to take birth in good families and good nations. The American people are very rich and beautiful, and these opulences are a result of pious activities. All over the world people are attracted to the Americans because they are advanced in scientific knowledge, riches, beauty, and so on. This planet is an insignificant planet within the universe, yet within this planet, one country--America--has so many attractive features. We can just imagine, then, how many attractive features must be possessed by God, who is the creator of the entire cosmic manifestation. How beautiful He must be--He who has created all beauty.<br>     A person is attractive not only because of his beauty, but also because of his knowledge. A scientist or philosopher may be attractive because of his knowledge, but what knowledge is more sublime than that given by Krsna in the Bhagavad-gita? There is no comparison in the world to such knowledge. At the same time, Krsna possesses full renunciation (vairagya). So many things are working under Krsna's direction in this material world, but actually Krsna is not present here. A big factory may continue to work, although the owner may not be present.|`|0OHdULR0aa	no difference; if you want you can coin your own name; its a matter of convenience.

AA12059450	2Peter 3:7 BY GOD’S WORD THE HEAVENS AND EARTH OF TODAY ARE BEING RESERVED FOR FIRE. They are being kept for the day when God will judge. Then ungodly people WILL BE DESTROYED. <br>  8 Dear friends, here is one thing you must not forget. With the Lord a day is like a thousand years. And a thousand years are like a day.  <br>  9 The Lord is not slow to keep his promise. He is not slow in the way some people understand it. He is patient with you. He doesn’t want anyone to be destroyed. Instead, he wants all people to turn away from their sins. <br>  10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. THE HEAVENS WILL DISAPPEAR WITH A ROAR. FIRE WILL DESTROY EVERYTHING IN THEM. God will judge the earth and everything in it. <br>  11 So EVERYTHING WILL BE DESTROYED. And what kind of people should you be? You should lead holy and godly lives.  <br>  12 Live like that as you look forward to the day of God. It will make the day come more quickly. ON THAT DAY FIRE WILL DESTROY THE HEAVENS. ITS HEAT WILL MELT EVERYTHING IN THEM.<br>  <br>  Notice the repeated idea, "EVERYTHING WILL BE DESTROYED." (Repetition indicates and identifies an IMPORTANT CONCEPT, so the EMPHASIS in this text is Peter's, not mine.) Peter tells us pretty plainly that NOTHING WILL BE "LEFT BEHIND." This means ANY interpretation of the "end times" which has things or people "left behind" CANNOT BE CORRECT.|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	Yes, the last book of the New testament, Revelations, is all about the end.|`|5308ab964dc585e2779ee9c4de92d391aa	the earth is forever it will never end<br>  the ungodly are rooted out of it and righteousness will reign forever<br>  a new earth and and new heaven<br>  the earth remains forever<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  jlu|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Yes.

Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. 12And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books.|`|m4guclgYaa	It does not give us a specific date, but there are plenty of signs.  The most prominent indicates Jesus will return before the generation which sees Israel become a nation passes away.  Since Israel became a nation in 1948, one generation can mean anything - a person can live 120+ years, so Christ can conceivably return as late as 2068 if the last person born in 1948 dies at the age of 120.  This is stretching it a bit, so conceptually Christ can return at any time between now and then.<br>  <br>  However, Christ's return is not the end.  When He returns, there will be exactly 7 years in which teh Antichrist is allowed to grow in power and rule over all mankind; the hallmark of this period will be the signing of a lasting peace treaty between Israel and the Arab nations.  Exactly halfway through this 7-year period, this peace will be broken and the Antichrist will seize power by establishing his "lordship" and demonstrating, through various signs and miracles, that he is the Messiah both teh Jews, and the Arabs have been waiting for.  He will set up his "throne" in the temple where he will rule over 1/4 of the earth with an iron fist, proclaiming to be God.<br>  <br>  Other parts of the world will not accept his rule and will rebel against him, primarily the orient (China - this may be tied in with oil interests to develop their industry).  An "army out of the east, numbering 200 million soldiers (this is mentioned in revelation) will march against Israel and teh Antichrist; joined by other nations.  They meet in the valley of Megiddo and all hell begins to break loose, when Jesus steps in and puts an end to it all.  This whole period, from the peace treaty to the point Jesus steps in, lasts exactly 7 years.<br>  <br>  Satan (the Antichrist) is bound and cast into chains for 1000 years, and Jesus Christ establishes his throne in Jerusalem, where He rules for this 1000 years.  There is no death, and the world is repopulated since the destruction caused by God's wrath and mass killings caused by the Antichrist has wiped out considerable portions of the population.  Near teh end of the 1000 years, Satan is let loose to test the faithfulness of mankind towards the Lord, and one final war breaks out in which the armies of Satan and those who stand agaisnt God are defeated.  The Day of Judgment comes in which all people, living and dead, are judged.<br>  <br>  After this, Revelation tells us the world is "wiped away" and recreated according to a new design which is only hinted at in Revelation 21-22.<br>  <br>  So yes, the world will end, and this is specifically stated in Revelation 21:1.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Jesus Christ Himself told us that it is not for us to know the time and day that the world will end.

mzRPndpyaa	Stealing in my mind is only not bad if its an absolute necessity to do so. A lot of companies are really struggling nowadays, my parents might lose there jobs and 20% of the workers there got laid off. especially small stores. Now I don't know if that classifies you as a "bad person" especially since you are concerned about it. The easiest thing to do would be to stop, you'll feel better, you wont have to worry about getting caught, or a criminal record.|`|TyuZ06UCaa	yes it does, because you are hurting the other person by doing so, although some types of stealing can be justified.|`|isRDHbJgaa	No it doesn't.

DTog0VZWaa	You've missed the point of the complaints.  We aren't defining their spiritual paths.  Their paths are about re-definding ours & that we object to.<br>  <br>  They literally say "they are a branch of Judaism."  The purpose is to invade OUR religion.  <br>  <br>  If they practiced theirs & say they weren't following Judaism (the name is taken) & didn't twist around our rituals & desecrate them IN the NAME of Judaism...then we wouldn't care.  They could call themselves Hebrew Christians & we didn't care from 1914-1970's until they changed the name to invade us & started up with purposely redoing the rituals in violating ways.  If they called it feast of unleaven bread but NOT a Jewish passover fine. <br>  <br>  There's a standard concept in Christianity of replacement theology that Christanity is better than & a replacement for Judaism.  Over the centuries in that name, many a Jew has been murdered for not accept Jesus.  They believe in this, & they are praciticing it.  Much or some of Christianity was aghast at where things went & has tried to be more aware & shift away from this theology.  Doing so actually makes Christianity's theology more consistent.  <br>  <br>  However, these groups were started by people who couldn't tolerate Jews being Jews.  So first they called themselves Jews to trick us into converting.  That hasn't gone so well.  So now they call themselves a branch of Judaism to shove their theology into OUR religion.<br>  <br>  They literally show up at our synagogues to worship their religion.  They go to our family in nursing homes & our children, & claim to be Jews.  Where it's a real problem - they go to the world & claim their religion is Judaism -- and the world, which is already confused & has lots of misconceptions of Judaism, hears this.<br>  <br>  I can respect those who get this idea of following Jesus more closely (not my cup of tea, but I understand their point.)  When they make it about attacking me & my religion...with the same essentially hateful disrespectful attitudes towards real Judaism as from the past...  I want to cry.  Why can't they leave us alone?  That's not spirituality.  What I can respect as a pathway too, they aren't doing, when they add making it about undermining us.<br>  <br>  Christains are so used to hearing that their religion has a relationship to Judaism & that they have a right to comment on our religion, that they tend not to see that this group crosses the line into pure assault tactics.  The next step from that level of disrespect can easily be Jewish bloodshed.  It's been that way many a time before.<br>  <br>  So, we aren't complaining about their pathway.  We're complaining about their intense disrespect for Judaism.<br>  <br>  ==============<br>  To continue my wordy answer...<br>  <br>  If Mormons declared you could be a South Baptist by following Joseph Smith & the Book of Latter Day Saints... that would seem wrong to you?  <br>  <br>  If they set up churches next to S. Baptists & called them  Full Bapstists (not Mormon because it's would be too obviously a new concept).  And they spoke at other churches about what Baptists are.  And they told the world Baptists were being intolerant of them (that's dangerous in a Jewish world.)<br>  <br>  A misconception Christains have is that Judaism has sects like Christianty.  We don't.  We have only ONE religion.  So it's not a new "sect" in Judaism.  It's violating Judaism to the core theologically, our one religion, like a Mormon declaring Baptists need to accept Joseph Smith & they have while still being Baptists.  Next question, is why would someone want to do that.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  Great!  Thanks for asking too.  :)|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Because it's dishonest, misleading, and disrespectful.<br>  <br>  It's not Messianic beliefs which are the problem, it's the fact that they call themselves Jews when they aren't. Both Chief Rabbis, the Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi and the Sephardi Chief Rabbi, have said that Messianic Jews are apostates from the Jewish faith.|`|AA11245447	It's not so much that we get upset over another's path, it's the inherent deceit that is perceived. We get the concepts of 'Messianic Jews' thrown in our faces when we say that Jews don't believe in Jesus.  Well, if THEY believe in Jesus and are Jewish, what's wrong with YOU?<br>  <br>  Judaism is Messianic, but since Jesus did not fulfill our prophecies, he is not our Moshiach (Messiah).  There a major differences between Christianity and Judaism and most "Messianic Jews" follow a Christian path, although they do not call themselves Christian (even if they celebrate Jewish holidays and some do study Torah).<br>  <br>  One poster (diff. question) suggested the term Nazarites; that'd be a great label since it differentiates Jews who follow Halacha (law) and those that believe that Jesus is their Messiah<br>  <br>  Jews CANNOT worship anyone/anything other than G-d; to do so would place us in apostasy.  Our Moshiach is not to be worshipped at all.  We worship G-d alone.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	I don't much care what they believe.<br>  <br>  But when they muck about in public forums giving born again fundamentalist Christian answers whilst proclaiming themselves Jews, I'm going to stand up for the truth about Judaism.<br>  <br>  You'll be familiar with the nonsense that some Christians will say about atheists. Now imagine if they decided to call themselves the 'real atheists'. And then the passersby believed them.<br>  <br>  That's what we're dealing with here.|`|NI0cNU22aa	Wrong, not all paths are "equally valid" according to Judaism, especially not one that lies about holy books to attempt to win over souls to Christianity.|`|TVJsOEKNaa	We don't really care about their beliefs, but we DO care about their evangelizing methods and the misrepresentation they are giving people by claiming to be Jews. <br>  <br>  I can call myself a unicorn, but does that make me a unicorn? No.  By the same logic stating that a Jew can believe in Jesus and still be a Jew is like stating that someone can be a "God believing atheist."  It doesn't work because it's a huge oxymoron.  <br>  <br>  In any case: The whole "Messianic Jew" movement was created for the sole purpose of evangelizing Jews and converting them to Christianity. It is the only evangelical group specifically geared towards converting one entire religion through the means of replacement theology (as Cher has stated). <br>  <br>  The problem was that most Jews wouldn't just convert to Christianity through proselytism. It's been an ongoing attempt for 2,000 years which essentially has failed. This puts a big constraint on evangelical groups because: <br>  <br>  A) If Christianity was right: Why didn't the Jews ALL just convert? <br>  B) The 'rapture' can only occur when all Jews have been converted  <br>  C) High priority is given to convert Jews (Matthew 10:5, 23:39) <br>  <br>  So, certain branches were left with a serious demise: How do they convert Jews? <br>  <br>  The answer "came" about 30 years ago with the "Messianic Judaism" concept. Jews wouldn't readily convert to Christianity through normal means (even non-educated Jews) so they had to make Christianity palatable as a result.  <br>  <br>  They created a movement and labeled it "Judaism" -- They started churches and named them "Synagogues", they had ordained Priests labeled as "Rabbis" (falsifying Rabbinal ordination documents in some cases), they wore yarmulkes (even though they explicitly don't follow the Talmud. However, wearing one is derived from the Talmud), they started singing Jewish songs in the street and started calling the OT/NT the Tanach. <br>  <br>  They actually have a special carrying card which instructs people how to specifically evangelize Jews.  Here are examples of what's on the card:<br>  <br>  -- Don't say Jesus Christ: Do say Messiah Yeshua<br>  -- Don't say convert: Do say Messianic, completed, fulfilled Jew<br>  -- Don't say Christian: Do say Bible believer, etc.<br>  <br>  Everything to detract from the overt appearance that they are Christians. They also primarily target uneducated Jews and older Jews.  <br>  <br>  This is what we have a problem with. It's like having someone come to you to talk about Christianity, when they are a Muslim. They wear a cross, talk about Christianity and then throw an Islamic undertone to it. They even hand you a copy of the NT and state that these are the Christian texts, when what you actually received was a Qu'ran.  <br>  <br>  That would be frustrating and deceiving nu?<br>  Well: That's the issue with "Messianic Judaism."  <br>  <br>  Rabbi Tovia Singer actually has an excellent, excellent article that covers all the bases on this one. I'll provide some links below if you're curious.|`|DxNUum6raa	Technically, in the Jewish faith, there is no such thing as a "Messianic Jew" While people of that belief may choose to call themselves Jews, they are not Jewish. Judaism has not had a messiah, so they are Christian. As it's a very controversial faith, as in many other cases, they feel the need to spread the word about their beliefs. This is not true of all Jews, nor all Messianic Jews. It is also a possibility that it is their personality, and not their faith.

Don't generalize! Family Guy rocks!|`|OUrPPjcHaa	I think the British are awesome. As you may already know, the British are stereotyped with bad teeth. I can never imagine the British having bad teeth, though. It also doesn't make any sense, since you have free dental care. The only time I really don't like the British is when I'm arguing with one on the Internet. They're always saying mean things about people from the United States... The same old boring stereotypes. It's like, "come on, can't you be a bit more original with your insults". Anyways, I'd like to visit Britain someday. I was even thinking of moving there, because I hear the weather is much cooler than here. I live in a state that gets quite hot during the summers.|`|faIU064Saa	In general we take our view of the British from our popular media just like you do with us Yanks. Unfortunately that means that we think you are all BBC period drama folks living with Jane Austen or stuck up posh royals and MPs. It is changing though, with the infiltration of Doctor Who and some Brit movies. But if you came up to an American sounding like a "mod" who still pals around with the Beatles or Michael Cain circa Alfie, no one here would bat an eye.<br>  <br>  P.S. Thanks for Top Gear and taking Paris Hilton of our hands.
OdTLUprzaa	Yeah I think as a whole the media is becoming more health-oreinted. Like I turn on Nickelodeon and they are telling kids to go outside and play a game to exercise. I think it has to do with changing fads.  Like right now, people are into health, fitness, nature, organics, etc. more than many other generations. So I think that the media/advertisements try to be up to date with this fad to please consumers. So we see it all more and more and more. It would be nice if they didn't think they needed to portray this type of rock-hard person all the time, but I think it's what they think America sees as the ideal. But it's interesting to realize that the reverse happens too - people see all the models in the media become obsessed with looking that way.|`|WJWW7NXaaa	You can't blame the media for that. Ab workout equipment wasn't put there by the media it was put there by people who designed a product and wanted to market that. Yes they are using the media to advertise their product but do you really think the TV station cares if you have taut abs?<br>  <br>  Celebrities in magazines are airbrushed, because most celebrities want their pictures to be airbrushed. Magazines wont sell more copies because the celebrity has a few less blemishes, but the celebrity will sell more albums if people think they look a certain way. Airbrushing is added work for that magazine.<br>  <br>  The Media is a blanket term that gets thrown around by people with misplaced anger. If you don't want to read about things to do with weight loss no one is forcing you to, but a lot of people have an interest in these things and they are there for them. <br>  <br>  It's like saying every song by the artists you don't like should be taken off youtube. "The media" is there for everyone and so must suit everyone's tastes.|`|xDOp37T7aa	I am a fatass. I actively intake several mediums of media and never feel the urge to look like the models I see.|`|DVOoH4oxaa	Yes, I think that the media and society each play their role in what they see as beautiful. I don't get much exercise and I stay as skinny as a pole, but if I ever do gain weight I am not going to make myself suffer for it by dieting or starving myself. I do not believe in that kind of thing. The media only focuses on the popular ideas of what is in society today. I figure eventually this fad on being rail-thin will pass, because as you look in history you find that there were other fads in which skinny people were considered ugly, eventually this one will pass by the same way.
JWjq5iaXaa	I believe you. I don't seriously believe in zombies either, and it is fun to think about.<br>  <br>  I guess it really depends on the person. Some people who fully understand the possibility of a zombie invasion could think to themselves, "oh man, this really could happen. I'd better get ready!" I mean, with the whole 28 days later thing I described in your other questions, a virus could potentially turn someone into a zombie. It dosen't exist yet, but who knows what the future holds? <br>  <br>  Now saying that, I don't mean that I fully believe it will or could happen. It's nearly impossible.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Some people see the reasoning and think, "oh yea, that's pretty realistic. who knows? You know what? just in case, a spare shotgun could always help!" People that think like this are most likely not insane or paranoid. I would be one of these people if I was old enough to buy a shotgun, heheheh :)<br>  <br>  Some people think "the truth is out there, it's possible! I'm stocking up on everything I need for something like this!" These people are just paranoid. Not the really bad kind of paranoid, but pretty serious. This dosen't mean they're insane.<br>  <br>  Then there are the people who will invest in a panic room when they realize how possible zombies are. These are the insane ones. When you buy a panic room, you should be thinking about bombs and riots, not zombies.|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	neither. you don't have to be insane or paranoid to believe that zombies exist. <br>  <br>  but when you start stocking up on weapons and supplies and turn your basement into a bomb shelter, and believe in zombies so much that it starts to affect your social life, then that leads to obsession and THAT leads to insanity.|`|DCltkysDaa	No but a serious belief in insanity will make you a zombie...|`|yqqemaFQaa	no it does not make you paranoid it just means you belong in the bellow than average IQ group of people its exactly the same as believing in a religion strongly|`|6f71b2cd793ff1b2e18fbf2a075142a9aa	Well, if you prepare for a zombie invasion, one would think you'd be prepared for just about any disaster that might come your way.
JWjq5iaXaa	Finally, I found someone who uses the term "Z-Day!" <br>  <br>  I told you my opinion on this already in that email, but this answer is for everyone who reads.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think #3 is the most realistic, I'll explain why.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  #1 created the idea of the "Zombie". The living dead. The walking corpse. Although the idea of a zombie goes back thousands of years to ancient times, the first zombie in pop culture would be from the 1930 film "Night of the Living Dead". They came from the grave to eat human brain. They stumble when they walk. They're killable, but they're tough. These zombies, while clever for their time, are pretty unrealistic. Re-animation (defining the existance of #1 zombies) is a sci-fi based adventure, but it's really unrealistic. <br>  <br>  #2 defines the evolution of zombies. Seen in movies like Shaun of the dead and Diary of the Dead, these are probably the most popular of pop-culture zombies. They're the living undead, most likely a)a virus or b) cause unknown, the zombies are these dying, rotting corpses that hunger for living flesh. While more realistic than #1, there are plenty of things about these zombies that wouldn't be real. for one, if a zombie ate a corpse, why would the corpse turn into a zombie? it physically couldn't, it's already dead... that would have to bring re-animation into picture again. two, why would the zombies move so slowly? three, how could they survive with rotting flesh?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  #3 is definetely the most realistic zombie. These so called "Zombies" aren't actually corpses, they just act like it. If something's dead, it's not going to come back to life. These zombies are humans, like us, with a disease or parasite. What does the disease do? Most likely, eliminate key parts of the brain to cause: <br>  -lack of common sense<br>  -destroyed brain capacity<br>  -the human to seek only live prey as sustenance<br>  -numbness of all parts of the body<br>  <br>  and basically everything that sets us apart from cavemen and wolves. And the reason they move so quickly is... well, why wouldn't they? what about a zombie would cause them to move so slowly? unless something in the brain that controls balance were destroyed, the zombie would move as fast as it could to catch its prey. and even in that case, they'd still try to move quickly, but they'd fall over.<br>  <br>  And about #1 and 2, why in the world would it be hard to kill them? what's so different about them? #3 is the closest to human, therefore is the closest to real, and the closest to being able to kill. You'd kill a zombie the same way you'd kill a human, hit a vital organ. the zombie would fall and twitch. a human would double over in pain, but a zombie (feeling no pain due to numbness of the entire body) would do whatever it could to still catch prey in its condition. This means a zombie, if about to die, would still do whatever it could to catch you.<br>  <br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  Shut up izzaknovak, it's all in good fun.<br>  <br>  *edit*<br>  "jimmiemetz's", I'm glad your impressed, but answering things like this is all for fun, and just a test of radical thinking. Do I really think zombies are going to invade? no. but it's fun to think about how they could exist, and what we'd do if they did. People say it would be fun if they did, and you might think it would be, but if they did and a zombie was gnawing on your leg, how fun would that be?<br>  <br>  also, you're english is pretty bad.|`|eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	A couple of points of order, to begin with - "Night of the Living Dead" by George Romero was made in 1968, not 1930. "The Zombie Survival Guide" is by Max Brooks, not Mel Brooks. Although that would be hilarious.<br>  <br>  If zombies could exist, there is really only one way for it to occur. Once a corpse is past a certain level of decay it could not reanimate simply because of the amount of damage done to the musculoskeletal structure. Second, if we are working with the idea that the only weakness a zombie has is its brain, we have to assume several things. The body has been infected prior to death, not reanimated afterward. The z-factor is keeping the brain alive by providing it oxygen, since the cardiopulmonary system is no longer working.<br>  The brain is guiding the neuromuscular systems, which are also being given O2 by the z-factor and kept alive. Without O2 the brain does not function, and without the brain the zombie can't ambulate. All other systems are expendable, and dead, slowly rotting.<br>  The z-factor requires O2 in order to keep its host alive - provided by warm, O2 rich, fresh blood and meat - which is why zombies "hunger" - without a fresh supply of "food" the z-factor begins to eat the hosts' body like a parasite, causing intense pain via the still-living neurological system. O2 is synthesized by the z-factor, which is in turn nourished by the "food" the zombie" ingests. <br>  As the z-factor slowly consumes its host, and the rest of the body necroses and breaks down, speed and strength are affected, usually within just a few days. A fresh, newly-dead "zombie" would be as strong and fast as he was in life, and no better, for a few days - and then would start getting slower and weaker, going from "fast-mover" to "slow shambler". Eventually, say two to three weeks at best, the rate of decay would cause the zombie to fall apart in a glutinous mass of bone and necrotic, worm-eaten, rotten tissue and organs, lying in a quivering heap until the z-factor finally exhausts itself and stops providing O2 to keep the brain alive.<br>  Since all systems except the brain, eyes, and neuromuscular system are dead, this explains why the best way to kill one is to destroy the brain - thus releasing the human intelligence inside into the arms of true death. However, the musculoskeletal structure can be compromised, such as severing hands - a handless zombie can't grab you, severing Achilles tendons or hamstrings - a crippled zombie can't chase you, or severing the spinal column above the pelvis, rendering the zombie paralyzed from the waist down and a sitting duck. Never swing a melee weapon for the skull - it could get lodged in the bone. A better idea is a sharp steel sword, preferably a quality katana, and swing for the neck to decapitate. Formed of mostly fleshy tissue, muscle, and cartiliginous tissue, there is really only one bony structure in the neck, and that is the vertebranous spinal column, at a location much more easily severed than at any other point in the whole torso.|`|uFUKFGwfaa	The true zombie is one that you do not have listed.  If you have read the book "Zombie Survival Guide" by Mel Brooks you would know.  When Z-Day finally arrives, zombies are exactly like the people they are in real life, except hungry for flesh.  They can run as fast as the people they were in real life.  This type of zombie can only be killed by destroying its brain.  This can be done by bashing it with a blunt object, stabbing it with a sharp object, or shooting it with some kind of projectile, like a bullet or harpoon.|`|PToFyrz5aa	well zombie expert, there is more than three types of zombies, you should know that.<br>  <br>  but most idiots dont know about two kinds of zombies, so I am impressed.<br>  <br>  your brain is not sucked out at this point, so go easy on your brain, you may loose it if you think to much.<br>  <br>  i will not answer your question, but do this for me, send me a email about a zombie that eats a goat without salt or pepper, or any bbq sauce at all, can you imagine such a thing?

JWjq5iaXaa	Good question.<br>  <br>  <br>  No, I don't believe zombies will invade. I really doubt something like this would happen, and even if it did, the government would be more than prepared to deal with it. <br>  <br>  I absolutely agree with you, It's A LOT of fun to talk about zombies, think of ways to stop them and create zombie plans. It's also fun to try and prove how zombies could exist, and debate on that topic. <br>  <br>  Then people get mad and say " hey, are you crazy? Zombies aren't real, go see a shrink!" And I just think, "relax... it's just for fun, don't get so uptight". I mean really, zombies?

wyvSAhtZaa	The Summer Equinox occurs on June 21 at 5:45 UTC this year (northern hemisphere). <br>  <br>  I don't know about you, but most places in the US are feeling the effects of Summer long before June 21. Let astronomers have it their way. The first day of astronomical Summer is not the same as the first day of meteorological Summer. Cities such as NYC, Chicago, and St. Louis are feeling Summer temps by the middle of May. Cities such as Minneapolis don't feel Summer weather until early June. And cities such as Miami are experiencing Summer weather throughout most of the year.|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Well here in the United States, and the rest of the northern hemisphere, the first day of the summer season is the day of the year when the Sun is farthest north (on June 20th or 21st).|`|AA11835015	in russia, we look at june 1 as the first day of summer. the usual scientific line of demarcation between the seasons is the sun's position to the world. the equinoxes are autumn and spring when the sun is directly overhead, 90 degrees, over the equator. summer and winter are the solstices (what is a solstice??!?) are about june 21 and dec 21. depends if you're in northern hemisphere or southern for the seasons. in australia, for example, summer begins on about dec 21. usa's winter solstice. this is determined by the farthest north the directly-overhead sun travels, 23,5 degrees, north or south latitude is the solstice.

"how did YOU do that?"  "What do YOU think of this?"  and just sound real interested in whatever he says back, make sure you agree with what he says (even if you really don't.)  Then he'll start liking you more because not only do you care about his opinion, but you'll start working the way he works, and that's the way he likes things done.  Then, after a bit of that, you can start trying to put your opinion in a bit.

Z3E2zKPWaa	No that is not true there was still racism here in CA. It's sad cause Californians rarely learn about our state during this time, when it comes to this topic...<br>  <br>  In fact the headquarters for the KKK on the west coast use to be Inglewood. It was Inglewood (or Watts i think) that use to have neighborhoods for middle class white people. But they moved out, once more black people started moving in. Also, look up the Watts riots, 1965..<br>  <br>  In Los Angeles there was a lot of segregation of Mexican Americans. In the late 40's, however, Mendez v. Westminster School District, made it unlawful to put Mexican children into "Mexican schools." However, the reasoning for this law to pass, was b/c Mexicans are technically half Spanish therefore, have white blood in them. But after that time there still was discrimination. Hence, the reason for the whole Chicano Movement, Brown Berets in LA. B/c the mistreatment and discrimination of Mexicans.<br>  <br>  Also in the late 40's was the release of Japanese people from the interment camps, in CA, as well as other places. Upon their return to their homes in CA, they were denied everything. It's like their life, their hard work, their businesses never existed.       <br>  <br>  Sorry for giving examples of the late 40's, but it's not like 5 years difference is really big. I still feel it's relevant to the question.|`|GrKiEDb1aa	Racism was EVERYWHERE..."WHITES ONLY" water fountains, bathrooms, restaurants, schools, on and on and on.

It was just most Blacks lived in the south at the time so more racial incidents happened back then.  California was mainly just Whites and Chicanos until the 50s and 60s when Blacks from the South started to move to Southern California. <br>  <br>  Movies and sitcoms always give a fake portrayal of things, they either make things out to be worse than they were or make things out to be better. But never the reality.|`|JQ3J5cdZaa	Racists were are still are everywhere, California is better on the whole then places like the deep south but there are still racists here.  50's sitcom didn't deal with racism anywhere because they always portrayed life as beautiful everywhere all the time even though we all know in reality that is never true.|`|gmaCvh00aa	Racism in the US has been encountered in every state.

5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	I have explained this so many times!<br>  <br>  Kanji are characters borrowed from China and modified to be Japanese.  They can be nouns, verb stems, names, adjective stems.<br>  <br>  Hiragana is used for particles, conjugating verbs, conjugating adjectives, names, and for children when they learn to read kanji, they are placed on top and known as furigana.  Also, you can use hiragana in place of kanji.<br>  <br>  Katakana is used for loan words and for emphasis.  So if I say, chikushou atsui dane! when I am texting a friend, I can write it as ちくしょう、アツイだね and atsui is in katakana, I am emphasizing it's hot.  It can be like how we use italics.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped
e9gXZsKxaa	Yes, it's too young, but lots of people have sex at 13 believe it or not....I was and I regret it...|`|eulMjLtPaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I also believe it's naive to think that it doesn't happen.|`|reNnLWh4aa	i agree because what is a 13 year old kid gonna do with a baby if that so happens???|`|uZQIUeyvaa	in our society we say yes but history proves that kids that young have had sex that young and lived normal lives or whatever.|`|MyX42szoaa	Regardless if you think it's right or not, it's happening.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	well having sex at 13 is horrible|`|JZMfUDylaa	yes. sex is a big responsibility why? because you can get pregnant or get STDs so it is those two people's responsibility to prevent that. at age 13 is way too young to have that kind of responsibility.|`|ivejg4whaa	I think it is because 13 year olds are not yet capable of making adult decisions and are not full capable of understanding all that comes with it.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Yes, that is terrible in my view.

However, most 13-year-olds are neither mentally prepared nor responsible enough for sexual activity. Whether this is for social reasons (our society frowns upon sexual activity at that age and thus neglects to prepare people at that age for sexual activity) or biological reasons (people that young don't have developed minds or enough life experience) is another question. Judging from the fact that people are generally sexually mature at that age (again, in a biological sense), it really wouldn't make sense that they would be mentally unprepared for sex for biological reasons, so I can only assume it's for social reasons. Then again, nature may have simply neglected psychological maturity in reproduction.<br>  <br>  A lot of the responses to your question will be emotionally motivated rather than rationally motivated, which is understandable. But viewing 13-year-olds as children is a modern convention. In certain Native American cultures, people were living on their own and working for a living by that age, and up until about 300 years ago, 13 was time for girls to get married and start making babies as far as most European societies were concerned. (In the play Romeo and Juliet, Romeo was 17 and Juliet was 13.) This is all because times have changed. Once the average human lifespan is, say, 120 years or so, the age of consent may be 28 instead of 18. You never know how society's views and moors will shift over time.<br>  <br>  I'm not promoting involvement in sexual activity at 13, however. Back when that was normal, it involved a lot of abuse, and today, people that age just aren't mature enough to be responsible with sexual activity. But I would add that I think it depends on the individual as much as does on the age. In my opinion, 15 is about the earliest a person can be prepared for sexual activity, and then only if they're educated on the subject, and never with anyone much older than themselves. But the longer you wait, the better. (I suspect a lot of people in their mid-twenties really aren't prepared for sex yet.)|`|jvjziDGeaa	Hun i am 13 and have one son. I was pregnant at 12.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I know most people tip more for mixed drinks than beer bottles since the bartender didn't do anything.  However if you have a separate waitress you guys ran her ragged with $800 of drinks brought to you and a table of 10 probably held up the table most of the night, stopping her from turning over as many tables and getting as many tips.<br>  <br>  Remind your friends that the cocktail waitress has to tip out the bartender for all those drinks and the hostess.  15-20% is average which is why most places do a group gratuity of 18%.  25% if you recognize that your table was a lot of work--more than average--or left the table very messy.  What percentage does your friend want to leave?  Sometimes I want to leave less when I constantly had to go to the bar to get my drinks.  If I don't feel the waitress ever came by, didn't bring us our meal, or we had to ask someone else to get our check b/c no one had seen the waitress, I would probably leave less.  Is your friend trying to suggest that you lower the tip due to poor service?<br>  <br>  However if you leave less than 10% tip, typically you should have a word with a manager about why you felt the service was especially bad.  I've left very low tips before but it was after I spoke to the manager on why the waitress didn't bring our food and never gave us a refill, or the check.|`|k03dYskYaa	Many restaurants automatically add an 18% gratuity for groups 6 or larger. That is good enough in my opinion.<br>  If the service was outstanding than maybe I would go up to 20%. But... 25% is way too much!<br>  Unless you and everyone with you just enjoys giving away $20 bills.<br>  Management thinks 18% is sufficient usually.|`|cNVTtkgmaa	You are tipping at the customary rate-only you would know if the service was worth it.

It's the subtle differences. For example, girls have thinner eyebrows, boys thicker. Girls have hips, boys don't. Girls smile a lot, boys don't always. Boys take up a lot of room, girls don't (not just physically, but boys spread out when they sit and walk, girls are well, dainty and tiny.) Girls also have different colors in their faces. They tend to have redder cheeks than boys, who have a uniformly colored face. Most important, SHAVE. SHAVE WELL. Girls don't have sideburns. <br>  <br>  As for wigs, if you're new to cd-ing or just trying out mft, then I'd say not to get a wig. Nice, passable ones tend to be expensive, and if you get a cheap one, you'll just look like a dude in a wig. Not something you want, right? <br>  <br>  Most important, have confidence.

1vgseyCqaa	Mexico is a colonial country and therefore all people of Mexico are as they are in the USA.  That is; if they are not from one of the European or Asian or from some other country they are native tribal people of some kind.  While it is true that the dominate other country is Spain and that there are some mixing with the indigenous tribes, mostly the colonial Spaniards try not to mix too much with the local 'indians' as much as possible.  The politics in the USA tends to assume that a Mexican is a kind of race.  Not true.  Political correctness also promotes this misconception that a Mexican is some very defined 'race' of people.<br>  All part of some false pride that was started and still is promoted by the Mexican government to expand a nationalistic pride in people the government wants and encourages to come across the boarder and take advantage of the USA based on Mexican pride.  There really is no culture to speak off no more than there is in most all colonial countries.  Africa is another example of this.  Africa is the name given to the continent by Europeans. It is also composed of various tribes of people and has no single history or culture.<br>  Mexico never really settled past being colonial.  The Spanish call themselves 'blue bloods' in Mexico and look down on the native peoples.|`|llez7aU4aa	same as here. Rural people and city people.

yhEDUN6qaa	I will be honest, i read none of that. But here is a list I had saved to my computer a while back called "Qualities of a drug seeking patient"<br>  <br>  DRUG SEEKING PATIENT<br>  <br>  * Unusual behavior in the waiting room;<br>  <br>  * Assertive personality, often demanding immediate action;<br>  <br>  * Unusual appearance - extremes of either slovenliness or being over-dressed;<br>  <br>  * May show unusual knowledge of controlled substances and/or gives medical history with textbook symptoms OR gives evasive or vague answers to questions regarding medical history;<br>  <br>  * Reluctant or unwilling to provide reference information. Usually has no regular doctor and often no health insurance;<br>  <br>  * Will often request a specific controlled drug and is reluctant to try a different drug;<br>  <br>  * Generally has no interest in diagnosis - fails to keep appointments for further diagnostic tests or refuses to see another practitioner for consultation;<br>  <br>  * May exaggerate medical problems and/or simulate symptoms;<br>  <br>  * May exhibit mood disturbances, suicidal thoughts, lack of impulse control, thought disorders, and/or sexual dysfunction;<br>  <br>  * Cutaneous signs of drug abuse - skin tracks and related scars on the neck, axilla, forearm, wrist, foot and ankle. Such marks are usually multiple, hyper-pigmented and linear. New lesions may be inflamed. Shows signs of "pop" scars from subcutaneous injections. <br>  <br>  * Must be seen right away;<br>  <br>  * Wants an appointment toward end of office hours;<br>  <br>  * Calls or comes in after regular hours;<br>  <br>  * States he/she's traveling through town, visiting friends or relatives (not a permanent resident);<br>  <br>  * Feigns physical problems, such as abdominal or back pain, kidney stone, or migraine headache in an effort to obtain narcotic drugs;<br>  <br>  * Feigns psychological problems, such as anxiety, insomnia, fatigue or depression in an effort to obtain stimulants or depressants;<br>  <br>  * States that specific non-narcotic analgesics do not work or that he/she is allergic to them;<br>  <br>  * Contends to be a patient of a practitioner who is currently unavailable or will not give the name of a primary or reference physician;<br>  <br>  * States that a prescription has been lost or stolen and needs replacing;<br>  <br>  * Deceives the practitioner, such as by requesting refills more often than originally prescribed;<br>  <br>  * Pressures the practitioner by eliciting sympathy or guilt or by direct threats;<br>  <br>  * Utilizes a child or an elderly person when seeking methylphenidate or pain medication|`|6ac013da2dceabac6383ebdee4f828c0aa	I suffer from migraines too and people who do not get migraines simply do not understand how much these headaches can affect and ruin our lives.<br>  <br>  It took me over 10 years to find a doctor to take me seriously.  One of them even asked me if I'd ever tried Advil.  Yes, Advil.  WTF.  You need to see a neurologist to get a migraine treatment plan that works for you.  Maxalt changed my life--too bad I cannot afford it, but that is another story.  I'm sorry it didn't work for you, but don't give up.  There are many options out there--non-narcotic ones.  Good luck.|`|npTZTzWRaa	rant|`|1QNRt09Faa	I have never suffered from migraines. I have had bad headaches, but only when I did not eat for a long period of time. Or if I was not drinking very much water. Sometimes we need to figure out for ourselves, what we have done that might have brought on the migraine. But I do not understand why the doctors do not know what is causing your headaches. Sometimes natural remedies work.  But living your whole life taking large quantities of drugs can only hurt other parts of your body later on in life. I do know from experience with someone I knew that a person does get ammuned to taking something for so long that they always need something stronger. Try and keep the faith and believe you will get through this. You also might be suffering from de-hydration.

Why do you ask this same question over and over? Are you insecure? Don't you know that the Buddha didn't call it a religion? It's really too bad that you're so "irked" by other people's views of Buddhism - most Buddhists seem unbothered by stuff like this.|`|S0dOcaNTaa	There's a confusion between the religion of Buddhism and the philosophy of Buddhism.  Sometimes we confuse one for the other.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Buddhism is indeed a religion; one that you don't understand, either.|`|LFWQiGYkaa	I think most do, as it is unknown to most.<br>  <br>  There is a case to be made for the idea it's not a religion. It's certainly not a religion if one includes strict authoritarianism in one's definition of religion. Zen Buddhists certainly don't seem to insist too much on metaphysics.<br>  <br>  I'm also a Buddhist. I'm more of the Zen persuasion.<br>  So I avoid putting labels on things.

Buddhism is not dogmatic. I use parts of buddhism as a philosophy and physical practice (ie. meditation), it's not a religion for me.<br>  <br>  It's a lengthy topic so you can say it's a religion or a philosophy and be equally right. Ultimately it's irrelevant, according to buddhism.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	Religion is defined as a belief in a supernatural power - either gods or dieties.<br>  <br>  Buddhism can either be atheistic or theistic, depending on the use of the philosophical values of Buddhism. Buddhism could be more accurately defined as a belief system, or spirituality.|`|CHZaXrOZaa	I believe it is a religion...a false one.|`|iblT1HJpaa	You're joking? <br>  <br>  Buddhists don't understand Buddhism! <br>  Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama 563-483 BC ?) was a devout Hindu and as such, worshiped hundreds, even thousands of gods. He was fed up with it all for through it all, all he could see was sick, dying and infirmed people all around him. He wanted to find a way out of this world of pain and suffering. <br>  He detested the gods and idols of Hinduism for they did not offer ANYTHING for the people to find release from the pain of this life. <br>  And you said where Buddhism has fallen. It is now a world of worshiping deities and even Buddha himself as a god. Buddha is literally turning over in his grave to see where man has brought his ideals for peace and "enlightenment". <br>  It is NOT a religion for it does not have a "god" at the center of it. But people, in their search for a personal god have transformed Buddhism into something that it was never intended to be. It is a very false religion for at the core of it, the "believer" has become his own god. <br>  All "religions" are man trying to reach out to God where Christianity is the only "religion" wherein God is reaching out to man. We cannot go to God in His infinite space. He can ONLY come to us and did so in the person of Jesus Christ. THis is why Christianity is different that anything else on Earth.

But there are some that simply take the passage in 1 Corinthians 11 to mean that women should literally cover their heads.<br>  <br>  Objections to this claim?  The context of the passage is talking about praying and prophesying in church.  If women cover their heads, logic would dictate that they should be allowed to pray and prophesy in church, which is something that the Bible elsewhere disallows.  Plus, headcoverings are often seen as a symbol of submission to the women's husbands, but the text clearly is not describing this.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Booyakasha!|`|e66a17d6e5488ceffc0d7dda78c5f232aa	Sounds like jehovas witnesses.

AA10067344	I know the verse you are speaking of and that is amusing.<br>  <br>  However, the point of the ashes is not to advertise what a pious person you are (in fact, as a Catholic you are required to attend mass today so doing so is not much of an accomplishment), but to remind everyone that this life is fleeting.|`|EBGdlo35aa	Well, in biblical times the wearing of ashes is the opposite of boastful.  Indeed, it was the ultimate sign of humiliation.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|AA11796124	It's only "odd" if you misinterpret the teaching.<br>  <br>  Matthew 6:1-6<br>  <br>  1 Take heed that you do not YOUR JUSTICE* before men, to be seen by them: otherwise you shall not have a reward of your Father who is in heaven. 2 Therefore when thou dost an almsdeed, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be honoured by men. Amen I say to you, they have received their reward. 3 But when thou dost alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth. 4 That thy alms may be in secret, and thy Father who seeth in secret will repay thee. 5 And when ye pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites, that love to stand and pray in the synagogues and corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men: Amen I say to you, they have received their reward.<br>  <br>  * "Your justice"... that is, works of justice; viz., fasting, prayer, and almsdeeds; which ought to be performed not out of ostentation, or a view to please men, but solely to please God.<br>  <br>  <br>  In other words, there are those worship God for the sake of worshipping God. This is nothing to hide but something to boast because this worship gives glory to God.<br>  <br>  It's those who feighn devotion to God, solely for the sake of "impressing" other people with their alleged piety. This is something to be shunned because this feighned worship is meant solely for bringing glory to man.<br>  <br>  <br>  <<I like spotting irony, so here it goes.>><br>  <br>  I would suggest you point out ironies to yourself IN SECRET until you get good at pointing out ironies.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	The ashes on our forehead are a sign of humility. The "dust to dust" part, of course. <br>  <br>  And it's hardly a mark of pride to have a big black splotch on one's forehead! Especially in our culture, which is so image-conscious. My goodness, I went to noon Mass with some co-workers and got teased mercilessly the rest of the day by the rest of the crew -- most of whom think all forms of religion are silly superstitions. I was embarrassed and found myself wishing from time to time that I had waited to go to a later Mass after work.  <br>  <br>  I don't know anybody who thinks of those ashes as showing off. <br>  <br>  Anyway, going to Mass isn't a big deal. It's not like you saved a starving person from hunger or stopped a war or something important. There's nothing to show off about if all you did was go to Mass.|`|z74a7wvlaa	We have to be humble in praying and giving alms as His father says so, otherwise we are just proud and broadcasting to men.<br>  The ashes is your reminder of where you came from: Dust thou art, to dust returneth; we we dont know when we die, so be prepared, repent and follow Jesus' ways. It's your catholic brand and destiny... be proud for the rest of the day.|`|b1e7acd9969e11fd38ae40bfed0968bfaa	I think that is the entire point.  We should pray, help the poor, be pious, etc. BUT we should not brag about it.<br>  <br>  Then why do we walk around with dirty foreheads today?  Good point, there was a time when it was very humiliating.|`|l3f8kf7xaa	Well, for some it could mean that. For me, I don't get it to flaunt it, I get it as a sign to myself, to humble myself, remembering to make my life count because I won't get a second chance. <br>  <br>  Like some would wear a cross to show they are Christian, I would wear one to remind myself of the sacrifice of Jesus. <br>  <br>  I think the intention behind one getting the ashes determines whether or not they are following that verse.<br>  <br>  <br>  And to the person who said Catholics are required to attend Ash Wednesday Mass, we are actually not required to. It is NOT a Holy Day of Obligation.|`|tpDICzslaa	Actually, the same thought crossed my mind. But I think they key point Jesus was making was do not make a big fuss in an effort to get attention and credit for your 'holiness'. He was deliberately overstating his case a bit to drive home this point.|`|nCU4mgbHaa	It means to not make a big deal out of it, hence to be humble. You do realize you can remove the ashes as soon as you leave church. Also Ash Wednesday is not a mass it is a service, you do not receive communion which would constitute a mass. <br>  <br>  <br>  Peace|`|jiszVclaaa	am i duno. like i got ashes today but i didnt go to mass.........................<br>  <br>  and thats a Catholic doctrine............... <br>  <br>  <br>  o and like i think ur making things black and white........<br>  <br>  lol...........|`|CEQpDpnPaa	nice...|`|k2bjQzMfaa	If you want to look at it that way, sure.

JyAUAbsjaa	absolutely.|`|UIJorsD7aa	No.<br>  The Jewish idea of God is that God is One and Indivisible. We cannot divide God up into separate parts, where each part of God is UnEqual to each of the other parts, but somehow they are one and the same. The Hebrew Scriptures describes God as an absolute One, but the Christian's New Testament describes the Christian idea of God as divisible into three parts called a trinity. In the Christian's New Testament, Jesus at one point claims to have different knowledge than other parts of the Christian Trinity. For example, Matthew 24:36 or Mark 13:32. In another verse, Jesus does not have the same power as other parts of the Christian Trinity, for example, Luke 23:34. And in Matthew 26:42, Jesus's will is not the same as the will of the Father. Indeed, Jesus often contrasted himself with the Father, for example, in John 14:28, or Luke 18:19. Furthermore, Jesus supposedly said that the punishment for blaspheming against one part of the Trinity is not the same punishment for blaspheming against another part of the Trinity. In the Hebrew Scriptures, however, God is One, as we read in Deuteronomy 6:4, as well as in Isaiah 44:6, where God tells us, "I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God." When Isaiah tells us that God said, "I am the first," it means that God has no father. When Isaiah tells us that God said, "I am the last," it means that God has no literal son. And when Isaiah tells us that God said, "Besides me there is no God," it means that God does not share being God with any other god, or demi-god, or semi-god, or persons, and there is no trinity.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Sadly, no.

Jesus was Jewish, and so were His 12 chosen Disciple's, in fact everyone in His circle was Jewish. He was born in Bethlehem, and came from Israel, A.K.A. the(Promised Land). It was the ''RELIGIOUS'' (Jewish authorities) that denied Him. The Jewish people are the Apple of God's eye's, and the Chosen Ono's, and in my opinion some of the most beautiful people in the world. Gee, that must be why God decided to be born a Jew, maby just one of the reasons?  Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no one can get to the Father except through Me, I am that I am. If you do not except this then you are not in Christ, and He is not in you. It's that simple no matter what religion you are.

Q6qyfPkRaa	first off God promised Noah he wouldnt destroy the world with water again and he hasnt and he wont... although floods happen and kill ppl they do not end the world sweety...<br>  <br>  2.Secondly, his decision isnt a matter of conflict. The bible states he did this strictly for Noah... noah was so terrified that he begged God not to do it again and GOD promised he wouldnt. where is the conflict?Besides, the next end of war is coming by fire this canbe found inthe word.. Its not that he shouldnt do this rather he made a promise to noah and  to date is sticking with it....<br>  2A.)  this qeustion is flawed and the evidence i put forth in answer 1 and 2 support your answer for this question.<br>  <br>  edit: it seems you already have your mind made up. Please dont take this the wrong way, but i can tell that by your statement u are carnal and have no comrephension of the spiritual. Neverthelss you seem passionate about this topic.  YOu said,Promise to noah or not etc.... like i said and as the wrod itself states,"GOD said he would not DESTROY THE WORLD with water again!!... how does this  equate to changing his mind!!!He never said he wouldnt destroy the world again, he only said by water, with that said, it would appear that GOD did in fact feel justified on his own accord in destroying the world... LAST TIME I CHECKED THE WORLD HAS NOT BEEN DESTROYED AGAIN BY WATER.. please tell me if u know sumthing i dont! PPL have indeed died in floods, but in no way was the world destroyed. i dont even see how that is so hard to digest(its pretty stragightforward).... and to answer your second qualm. honey, even the bible itself states that "GOD has mercy on who he has mercy" for whatever the reason and since he is GOD an all, I think He can keep a promise to anyone he pleases to do so with, especially since it does not go against his laws!!!BTW you might wanna read the book b/c GOd does a lot of things for HIS anointed  just b/c they asked an in this situation is does not go against his righteousness b/c he did indeed destroy the world and will do it again. So how it is going against his plan? He planned to destroy and he will  and he did.... the same result is aciehved( according to his plan of destruction) no matter the method eg. water, fire, ice etc.. and that result is DEATH!!!so , tell me that is makes a difference if GOd said" cool Noah, i will destroy the world again but not with water since u weere terrified"... how is that relevant at all... he didnt go againt righteousness he made a covenant with noah.. Ya know GOd was allowed and he did make many covenants or promises to his ppl.... so what is the prob?|`|zQyslfHKaa	Not only that, but Christians claim God and Jesus are one through the trinity, yet God spent 4000 years helping the Jews kill gentiles and keeping them seperate from them, only to do an about face and include them.<br>  <br>  I am sure the murdered Midianites would have been a little miffed at finding out that God was planing on including them in salvation a few hundred years later....<br>  <br>  The other huge problem of course is asking whether Jesus would kill children,  most Christians would answer of course not, yet God did it all the time.|`|DDFgKxcaaa	the bible writers didn't think through their stories very well

And he gave them right standing with himself, and he promised them his glory.  <br>  Rom 8:31   What can we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us?  <br>  Rom 8:32   Since God did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won't God, who gave us Christ, also give us everything else?  <br>  Rom 8:33   Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? Will God? No! He is the one who has given us right standing with himself.  <br>  Rom 8:34   Who then will condemn us? Will Christ Jesus? No, for he is the one who died for us and was raised to life for us and is sitting at the place of highest honor next to God, pleading for us.  <br>  Rom 8:35   Can anything ever separate us from Christ's love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or are hungry or cold or in danger or threatened with death?  <br>  Rom 8:36   (Even the Scriptures say, "For your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep."[fn12])  <br>  Rom 8:37   No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.  <br>  Rom 8:38   And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from his love. Death can't, and life can't. The angels can't, and the demons can't. Our fears for today, our worries about tomorrow, and even the powers of hell can't keep God's love away.  <br>  Rom 8:39   Whether we are high above the sky or in the deepest ocean, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.

I fact, in my younger days I might have even been inclined to go off to the Pacific Northwest and look around myself.  However, I find it very hard to believe that with all the people that are wandering around in the woods out there hunting, fishing, and hiking, to say nothing of all the people that have dedicated their lives to the search for such a creature, no one has been able to produce a body, skull, or skeletal remains of any type.  Footprints and fleeting glimpses are one thing, but unless these beings are immortal, there would be skeletal remains.  Unless of course there were only a couple of these beings.  In which case they could have died out without any remains being found.  However, the reported sightings of these beings are spread out over a very large area and a very long period of time so we must certainly be talking about an extremely large population.  If that were the case, remains would certainly exist.  Then again, these could be intelligent beings that take care of their own dead as humans do via burial or cremation, that would explain why remains have never been found. So the bottom line is that I guess we'll never really know for sure will we?|`|PR28wVHzaa	A lot of people have spent a lot of time searching for BigFoot. Not a shred of evidence has been found. I doubt it exists.|`|q9BItD25aa	No, I do not.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	Yes I do believe in Bigfoot: Perhaps it was pets that was released from aliens that have visited this world on many different times or pets that survived a crash and has wondered around for all these years. Or an experiment that went wrong in trying to create a human race by aliens that failed. Or a genetic race, a family that was born with a very hair body that was out cast a long time ago, and has survived all these years on there own . There have been seen young Bigfoot so we know that that must be a family of them around this earth. For any thing is possible is it not so.
RermzbWgaa	Communion, while very important, is largely a looking back upon the sacrifice of our Lord.  What is used does not really matter.  <br>  <br>  That said most Presbyterian (Reformed) Churches use wine (and do not oppose the consumption of alcohol on other occasions either), and unleavened bread (mainline PCUSA however would use "bread common to the culture" of the particular church....so leavened more generally).<br>  <br>  Some in the church would see this as a bigger issue than I have stated here.  So I am not trying to state what all Presbyterians believe on this subject (I am of a more Conservative Presbyterian line than the mainline PCUSA....but the mainline is not significantly different on this subject).|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	It's been a while but I remember something quite similar to the oyster crackers you get with clam chowder.  <br>  I.E.

The psychic element is a physical function, it changes with your health.  I get more premonitions if I get a cold or some other illness.

A person who is kind, compassionate and honest, who has regard for other people, is "spiritual" in my opinion. But people who are judgmental bullies who enjoy looking down on others and telling them they're going to suffer for eternity are NOT spiritual, no matter how many Bible verses they have memorized or how many times they've gone to church.

Man attains divine union by progressive reciprocal spiritual communion, by personality intercourse with the personal God, by increasingly attaining the divine nature through wholehearted and intelligent conformity to the divine will.

0hQyClksaa	You don't know the half of it!<br>  <br>  Genetics...systematics....phylogeny...... the list goes on and on....every one of these branches of science dealing with evolutionary theory have lies deeply embedded within their structure.  What makes them lies is the FACT that such things are taught as facts when they are ONLY assumptions.<br>  <br>  Assumptions are not proven, because if they were, they would no longer be assumptions.  For example, in genetics, evolutionary scientists continually tell you that it is a fact that adaptational changes are responsible for a fish evolving into a mammoth.  Hog-wash!  In their evolutionary writings to other evolutionists they continually state that they assume this because they have no direct evidence...which makes it untestable, unrepeatable in controlled environments.<br>  <br>  This means that such things (in their own words) are not scientific because they cannot be demonstrated as having a naturalistic cause.  They assume adaptation runs into evolutionary change (fish to mammoth), but in their textbooks they are teaching our children the lie that adaptation runs into evolutionary change.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	You need to rationalize your beliefs. "Evolution is a lie from the devil". Your claim, prove it. A sentence of willfull ignorance from a person who will not look into things more than their pre-conceived bias. Piltdown man was not known to be a hoax at the time and always never seemed to fit so it was packed away and when put up to more advanced scientific inspection later in time was shown to be a forgery. Science is a study, not a belief. So a reconstruction of java man is a educated assumption of what it could of looked like. Science is never complete and never will be. Evolution will never be considered absolute truth as that is only the case in mathematics. Evolution is a study and must be analized and challenged by anyone and everyone who thinks they can find some flaw in it to correct it.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Sadly you are isolating yourself as a delusioned thinker and a BAD Christian!!<br>  <br>  The Pope, Catholic Church, Church of England and mainstream churches all accept evolution and the big bang!!<br>  <br>  Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put it rather well – “Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth”!! <br>  <br>  Come on when the churches preach against you then surely it is time to reconsider your thinking!!|`|LGBNKuxRaa	nah man, satan was only responsible for the invertebrates and plants. the evil atheist conspiracy planted the vertebrate fossils. we just got done with antarctic lagomorphs, by the way. should be safe to look down there now. now that I've told you this, we'll have to mindwipe you. sorry... remember, we don't exist.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	I could show you more outright lies that Creationists and followers of Intelligent Design use.

I wonder. <br>  I wonder if the monotheistic god of the jews and muslims evolved two added iterations at Constantine's convention in Nicaea?  <br>  You know, of course, that science does not lie; science is a method of knowing through experimentation or examination of natural phenomena in a systematic manner.  It's the empirical method of knowing.  This kind of knowing is antithesis of religious knowing which relies on blind belief in authority that persecutes those who question authority and calls them infidels or heretics, tortures and kills them.<br>  I prefer not to have faith in Jimmy Swagart, Bob Jones, Jim Jones, Jerry Fallwell, Ted Haggard, Oral Roberts or other hypocritical scum bag.  <br>  I do, however, like the things that Jesus said about how to treat one's fellow man, as children of god and treating them as god himself.|`|1JsWMX0daa	No. evolution supports the order of creation described in genesis. it does NOT contradict genesis. most people of science do not exactly study the bible. and most christians dont exactly study books of science. if you studied both you would see that science supports the existance of God and genesis. and you'd be a fool to read genesis once or twice and think that you got it.  people spend their life studying the bible and never get everything out of it.|`|M4tAy4ECaa	You do realize that it was SCIENTISTS who debunked those myths...hmmm?<br>  <br>  That's the best part of science, it is updating, open to correction, improvement, research, expansion, etc.<br>  <br>  When science spots a mistake it corrects it immediately...what's wrong with that? we know which ones are likely true or not, base on the evidence and research, science don't hold these things through faith or beliefs, SCIENTIFIC theories must undergo countless scrutiny, peer reviews, experiments, etc. <br>  <br>  unlike the bible....countless translation, misinterpretations, metaphoric, symbolic, subjective, vague, and allegorical mistakes|`|AA12267979	funny how those examples aren't in my evolution textbook... after all science is continually reviewed and researched to find truth unlike religion|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	yes there are many as the age of the earth was guess work a assumption based on no facts<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/age.html" rel="nofollow">http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/age.htm...</a><br>  <br>  yes it is a doctrine of demons that influences men who deny god.|`|x3CXKalvaa	I could understand you not believing in evolution seeing as you haven't yet evolved yourself. moran.|`|AA11490975	How this can be seen as a rational response to anything is simply remarkable.|`|1WisnX8naa	But they were also corrected by science...<br>  <br>  You're the one making the claim, hunt them down and expose them...|`|9tRZP9yaaa	Yes Satan is a liar.|`|eJZPAcXnaa	Satan is a lie from you.|`|DDFgKxcaaa	no.  satan is a lie from evolution that is slowly dying out|`|BPO6roTOaa	Fail.|`|E7fguoVBaa	Yep.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	YES!! <')))><|`|AGKOaVEkaa	Yes it is|`|czf6uhIraa	*yawn*<br>  Fail troll|`|66cRs4RYaa	nope|`|FDVuAiHOaa	Oh no you didnt...|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	No.<br>  <br>     1.  Piltdown man was exposed by scientists. The fact that it took forty years is certainly no shining example of science in action, but it does show that science corrects errors.<br>  <br>        Preconceptions are an unavoidable problem in just about any investigation, but they are less so in science because first, different scientists often have different preconceptions, and second, the physical evidence must always be accounted for. Many scientists from America and Europe did not accept Piltdown Man uncritically, and the hoax unraveled when the fossils could not be reconciled with other hominid fossil finds.<br>  <br>     2. One hoax cannot indicate the inferiority of conventional archeology, because creationists have several of their own, including Paluxy footprints, the Calaveras skull, Moab and Malachite Man, and others. More telling is how people deal with these hoaxes. When Piltdown was exposed, it stopped being used as evidence. The creationist hoaxes, however, can still be found cited as if they were real. Piltdown has been over and done with for decades, but the dishonesty of creationist hoaxes continues.|`|bRLCxmP6aa	Because science is based on observation and experimentation, and because scientific results are peer reviewed and must be testable, verifiable, and repeatable, "lies" and deliberate falsifications of data are typically uncovered relatively quickly by other scientists (yes I know Piltdown Man took a while to be uncovered, but that was not a typical case).|`|DzGKfdKnaa	I think anything that distracts you from God and/or helps you to deny Him is subject to my skepticism.

Everything else in it is "KILL THE EVIL HERETICS!" They pretty much just slipped Jesus in to make themselves look less insane.

The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.<br>  <br>  -Luke 12:51-53<br>  <br>  Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace but a sword.<br>  <br>  -Matthew 10:34<br>  <br>  According to the bible, Christ said this about war:<br>  And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.<br>  <br>  -Matthew. 24:6-7<br>  <br>  In short, he accepted that war occurs.<br>  <br>  Factually, Hitler's actions were legitimized by Pope Pius XII, at best, and ignored, at worst.  The Crusades were waged at the behest of the church.  So yes, christianity has had it's hands in two of humanity's biggest attrocities.<br>  <br>  As for rejecting Christ's 'teachings', I make this challenge:  Prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt that Christ existed, let alone preached ANYTHING.<br>  <br>  Christ can't be judged on what he said, because there is no evidence to support that he said anything.  Every single writing attributed to him (or used to claim he lived) is a minimum of a generation removed...making it hearsay, not proof.  The words that people claim are his are, at best, the writings of individuals with an agenda.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	Hitler's religious beliefs (if he had any at all besides the adoration of Adolf Hitler) were simply a tool to incite the empty Nationalism of a proud but down-trodden people.  If he could use Christianity to seduce some of the German people into following him down the blood-drenched path, he wouldn't hesitate to do it.  The Crusades were as much a response to the in-fighting of the European world at the time as they were about any real commitment to religious belief.  It's the same sort of nonsense W. tried in America - claim a "common enemy" in the hopes that everybody will put aside their differences and unify under a banner of war, regardless of the real consequences.<br>  <br>  I have no problem with a person's religious belief until it conflicts with a concept of Justice - demanding a 2000 year-old text have the final word about what is and isn't Justice in this world is a sorry substitute for public debate about our values and ethics.<br>  <br>  You also seem to be under the impression that people are atheists BECAUSE there are events in the Bible and Christianity's history that we would now question in terms of the Justice ideals we hold now.  Though it is true that some atheists will point these out, it is to stress how the Bible and/or Christianity cannot be the sole arbiter of Justice anymore than the Koran or Homer's ILIAD can be - the authority derived from any book or religion cannot be thought of as absolute in their authority.  <br>  <br>  It is not to explain why an atheist chooses to be an atheist.  You seem to begin by believing that the existence of God is a generally accepted fact (which it is not) and that the Divinity of a teacher 2000 years ago named Jesus is irrefutable.  You must realize not everybody finds the claims so utterly convincing as you do.  You should at least reach that understanding within your own mind when in conversation with those who hold differing views.  Jesus at times seems to be a very wise and strong personality.  That his words were placed at a lower emphasis than His divinity is indeed the most tragic thing about His story.<br>  <br>  Therefore (using the words of your religion's founder) you should probably stop worrying about atheists, and concentrate on those Christians today that represent the horrible paths that Christianity often takes and "remove the log in your own eye before you try to remove the splinter in another's."  Christians on R&S alone are some of the most despicable rumor-mongers I've ever heard in my life - you could start by being a Christian who stands up to that sort of garbage.|`|9p7KONTkaa	I am not against the teachings of Christ, I am against the teachings of the Christian Church. the westboro Baptist church follow the True teachings of the bible more closely than other Churches. Christianity does preach that it is the only way, and with more and more Americans turning to secularism, according to the rules of Christianity, America Would be going to hell.|`|7J69CQvTaa	You are using the "No True Scotsman" logical fallacy.<br>  <br>  Hitler believed in the divinity of Jesus thus he was Christian. How he interpreted the Bible is an entirely different matter. <br>  <br>  For starters, there is no "objective interpretation" of the Bible. If there was then there wouldn't be any Christian denominations (i.e. Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, Baptist, Pentecostal etc.) who each interpret the Bible in their own way. Which one of them is "true" Christianity?<br>  <br>  <br>  There are good and bad people in every social niche. Just deal with it.|`|1WisnX8naa	To start with, I'm not against the teachings of Jesus. What would give you that idea?<br>  <br>  Second, I never blamed anything on your Jesus. I don't even agree he existed, let alone be a god...<br>  <br>  It's what people DO in the name of gods/Jesus/Bible that are the problem...  whether they believe or not is the problem...<br>  <br>  But since I also do not see Jesus as a god/saviour, it's not going to make me religious either...|`|0ALinE42aa	Too bad you Christians don't obey Jesus, either.<br>  Don't use the "true Christian" AKA, true Scotsman fallacy.

Fool.|`|7QrKLh2gaa	Atheists don't judge Jesus. We don't believe in him you see. I don't think you quite understand what it means to be atheist.|`|APjnSYKuaa	Hitler was just Hitler. He wasn't above using anything for his benefit. He was quite fond of some of Martin Luther's more antisemitic writings, but I don't think that made him an upstanding Christian by any means.<br>  <br>  The Crusades on the other hand, were indeed driven by subjugating Christianity as can only be done with that type of religion with such strong dogma. <br>  <br>  As an added note, all those who are fond of claiming early scientists and scientific advancement as being driven by Christians are obligated to include the Crusaders and Hitler with the same arguments.|`|KOecCLjLaa	Hitler was a devout father, family man, and Christian.  He had some faults, but so does everyone.  He got hooked on drugs and that tends to alter and toss off everyone a bit.<br>  <br>  Without Christians there wouldn't have been any Crusades, wouldn't have been a lot of wars and subsequent deaths.  The world in my opinion would have been way better off without Christianity.<br>  <br>  Jesus went around claiming he was the king of the Jews and the son and representative of God on Earth... had to do it differently, I would be opposed to crucifixion for Jesus... I'd of tossed him into the gladiator arena instead, either to fight or to be killed by wild animals, don't really care<br>  <br>  note: I don't really believe Jesus ever existed, I've never seen proof enough to believe that such a person ever did|`|jbPDlYnnaa	Why do you think Hitler was Christian?<br>  <br>  According to some, Hitler had a general plan, even before the rise of the Nazis to power, to destroy Christianity within the Reich.<br>  <br>  The leader of the Hitler Youth stated "the destruction of Christianity was explicitly recognized as a purpose of the National Socialist movement" from the start, but "considerations of expedience made it impossible" publicly to express this extreme position.<br>  <br>  Hitler was widely known to have an obsession with the occult.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Westboro church are idiots.  There are about 70 members of the church, and 60 are related by blood or marriage.  NO ONE likes them.<br>  <br>  You're right.  People blame Christianity for every evil inflicted on mankind.  In reality, far more people have been killed by secular governments.  Even the Crusades, Inquisition, etc. were not motivated by religion.  They were motivated by the lust for money and power.  That's not just an opinion.  The Crusades were launched to gain land and expand the Holy Roman Empire.<br>  <br>  "High ideals were besmirched by cruelty and greed...the Holy War was nothing more than a long act of intolerance in the name of God."<br>  ~Sir Steven Runciman<br>  <br>  I dated an atheist.  She didn't believe in God, but blamed Him when things went wrong.  I think atheists were wronged by a Christian/Christians at some point, which is why they hold Christianity in such contempt.  In the words of George Carlin "The number one cause of atheism in the world today is Christians."  I think it's similar to racism, sexism, etc.  Prejudice is judging all members of a group from the actions of a few.  Sadly the most extreme are also the loudest, therefore, they get the most attention.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|zQyslfHKaa	It does say those things, but it also says that Jesus prepared Hell as a place of suffering for the devil and non believers.<br>  <br>  It says that he didn't come to bring peace but a sword.<br>  <br>  It says unless a man hate his family he cannot love Jesus.<br>  <br>  You need to understand that just because you choose to focus on the positive messages and ignore the negative ones, doesn't mean that the people who focus on the negative one's are wrong.<br>  <br>  Afterall they are both in there.  Hitler used Martin Luther as an inspiration for his belief system.  Martin Luther was an incredible anti Semite, because of his religion, and all protestant Christians claim he was a great man of God.  He wrote 'Of the Jews and Their Lies'.  The Crusades were done in God's name, and many a knight rode of to Jerusalem to kill Arabs for Jesus, because they had 100% faith in the new testament.<br>   Christians disassociate themselves from the horiffic parts of the bible, because they would like to claim it is a good, healthy philosophy, when in fact, it is only good, when a large portion is ignored or excused away as not from our time.  It still says those things.<br>  <br>  If the bible was full of only positive messages, I would be right there next to you, but it simply isn't.  Most Christians are too busy trying to excuse it, to notice how much immoral stuff is in there.<br>  <br>  Read Numbers 31, imagine what it would have been like for a captive Midianite boy.  Then imagine you are an antisemite like hitler, and learned that God promoted the utter destruction of races of people who were his chosen ones, and you were convinced Aryans were the chosen ones....The Bible absolutely had a role to play in his horrific behavior, as Mein Kampf is clear about.|`|dX8qCoJ3aa	Lol dude, I'd just give up now. Logic won't work on atheists.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Wtf are you  going on about.<br>  <br>  Who says Jesus wouldn't be in agreement with many of us. Why do you have such issue that I don't believe he was some magical fantasy character?<br>  <br>  I don't think anyone has ever blamed Jesus for Hitler.<br>  <br>  <br>  Those people CHOOSE to represent it and in the way that they do. It is up to the rest of you if you choose to allow people like that to be the face of it.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Of course both were christian - history records that well as proven fact!!<br>  <br>  But look at modern times!!

With social pressures involved, one could be in denial and not really know. They can tell themselves that they are straight, and they believe it. Even if you "experiment" it can still be hard to tell because of denial. I suppose the best thing to do is give it time, and hopefully the true feelings will emerge. I also believe it can work the other way around. Social pressures can also cause one to think they're bi/gay.

Why can't god do that? Nobody has ever seen or talked to god except people on drugs. The world and Universe are not perfect which would also prove that god is not perfect if he exists.

I am sure it is due to a bad encounter with a few of them.<br>  <br>  Belief in God is quite historic.  Simple conclusions drawn by science are in no way going to disprove a God.  It is just odd that you would want someone to deny the existence of a God entirely.  Does it harm you that people believe in a God?  Directly harm you that belief in a God is held by others.  You may argue that do to the link of politics and religion, that laws are developing slowly that should have already developed.  You may argue many things about religion.<br>  <br>  I ask, though, how are you directly hurt by someone believing in God?  I think that you may not be.  Now the organization of religion creates some problems, sure.  People try to unite in their belief, causing some issues along the way.<br>  <br>  I wonder, if people are benefiting from a belief in God, why would you want to strip that from them?  Are you not harming them by trying to take away what they have belief in?<br>  <br>  I can't find how it is pathetic that someone holds on to a belief in something greater than them.  I find it pathetic that someone would torment and try to distroy something that another has.  The greatest things in life cannot be explained.  Emotions are still quite a mystery in science.  These untangable feelings that we have can be mysterious at times.  You may argue that some are survival things, but really, all the emotions are survival?  Why is their depression and empathy for the dead?|`|PITPLsx2aa	No I don't think so.<br>  <br>  Which is more pathetic, the man that has felt the love of God and is willing to live that life in faith and trying to do the will of God (help the sick the poor, do good etc.)  or the person that calls such a person pathetic?  <br>  <br>  I think it is the later, without that faith there is no way to salvation and Jesus said that we had to have the faith of a little child.  The faith of a child is tied in with the love and innocence that we seldom see in adults so a Christian without reasons to believe is still saved.  A person with a "rational reason" and no love for God in their heart and no faith is still not saved.<br>  <br>  Henry Drummond talks about love and our relationship with God in his book "The Greatest thing in the World", I think it is a good read and here is a link where it is available for free online.  <br>  <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16739" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16739</a><br>  <br>  Prof. Daniel B.

That we understand how nothing ever came from nothing, that life did not spontaneously burst into existence, that people did not derive from fish or monkeys or whatever you might be on this week. For all of history there have been people who have no trouble believing in God and people who cannot believe in God. This is never going to change. What could you possibly care about people you view as irrational anyway? Why don't you just find something else to do and leave us to our irrational ideas.

I disagree with what the people told you who said that nature is perfect, because nature is not perfect since the world will never be a perfect place. I also disagree with the argument that life will be a picnic once you accept God into your life, because sometimes bad things still happen to people who believe in God. So why believe in God? The reason for many is different, but for me it was based on faith. I know you are probably rolling your eyes at this, but it's good to know that there's someone I can talk to who will never abandoned me. Religion can really help many people, because it establishes hope and encourages people to love and help others. I don't think that having a spiritual belief in something is pathetic at all. If you really want to understand, than you should try studying religion yourself or go to church one day.. I'm not telling you that you have to go to church or will end up in hell, but if you're curious than there's no harm in actually experiencing religion yourself. Someday you might be less critical of those who believe in God. If not than I am sorry, because you're just missing out.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	My answer is - I believe in the Bible being the truth, and that it came from God because of Him wanting us to have a pathway we could follow to be able to live forever with Him in Heaven. And He sent His only begotten Son to redeem us from our sins, making it possible that I won't have to pay for my sins, Jesus did. And I accept Him for being my personal Savior, knowing He died for me even if I was the only one on earth He would still have came to earth for me. I believe He is the only living God and I want to serve Him because of what He did for me, and that I will have eternal life and live forever with Him in Heaven.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	loltalk about dedication(or obsession i cant descide) you posted this question at 4:44am are you mad?|`|YupMCYHlaa	It's unfair for a creationist to describe evolution as an alternative religion, or to lump together all the believers of other faiths as 'atheists' or even 'satanists'.

If you would like others to respect your thoughts and views, rational or otherwise, then you ought to respect theirs.<br>  <br>  The fact is, it's just as hard to prove God doesn't exist as to prove that he does exist.

pVrNJmgpaa	in my opinion, morality is based solely on nurture or environment. This is quite clear when you observe different cultures/religions/beliefs/societies etc. Moraility is based on ones own opinion or their own personal beliefs.  I'm a moral person, in regards to my stardards, I don't know about yours. I am a good person, if that's what you are trying to get at.|`|0YQRbq9faa	No, I try my best not to do evil, sinful things.  However, I am human and will do bad things at times.<br>  <br>  The Holy Spirit usually convicts me about these things instantly and I repent and ask God to forgive me and cleanse me according to I John 1:9.<br>  <br>  The conscience of a believer has been cleansed by the Holy Spirit and is much more sensitive than the conscience of a nonbeliever. That is just a fact.  Therefore, the resulting guilt and remorse when we do wrong is strong and leads us to repentance.|`|HEDSOHq1aa	morals do not exist<br>  <br>  i did lie and cheat once or twice, but there wasn't any other option that wouldn't harm me.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	Didn't you only ask the atheists last time???

AAgX0SDcaa	Considering they are assuming you should speak the language and asking a negative question, yes, I would be offended.

I do think you went above and beyond to be polite to him. I commend you for your patient effort.|`|wGpla9xraa	Well, I hate this. I speak Spanish quite well... I am Mexican but I don't look it. My father and mother both had very light complexions. <br>  I live in San Diego,CA.....15 miles from the Mexican border to Tijuana so... I'd have to say I wouldn't be offended...irritated maybe.<br>  <br>  My problem tends to be quiet the opposite, when I hear the tell-tale signs of ESL (English second language) individuals that seem to struggle, I'll be the one that initiates the switch to Spanish....but due to my complexion I often times offend the individual with my attempt at courtesy. <br>  <br>  After years and years of this (I've lived here since I was born 28 years ago), I finally realized it's a cultural thing and more specifically a Chicano thing (Chicanos are American born latinos). They hold onto the language as a cultural milestone, to me it's a language nothing else. I also speak French, German and a very tiny bit of Japanese and I've never had that problem with those cultures. Even when I cross the border into Tijuana, Ensenada or Rosa rito, I find that english or spanish it doesn't matter. But if they're USA born and are mexican and speak the language fluently....they're bound to ask.<br>  <br>  The only other issue would be the "if you can't speak the language, why do you claim the culture?" arguement.|`|db4364cbdfee80cd73b4e6424bc57dfdaa	I am Brazilian and as in Brazil it is spoken  Portuguese is common the people think that I speak Spanish.

LOL!!|`|qb23ebljaa	lol no..just ignore it|`|fc4NOCp3aa	Well I think he did alot of assuming.  He assumed that because you live in a heavily spanish speaking area, that you would speak it.  Also, if you are of hispanic ethnicity, it would have been natural for him to assume you spoke spanish.  So, in your case, I don't think you should've been offended if he assumed you spoke Spanish.  Now, once he learned you didn't speak it well, he should not have gone on and on about it!  <br>  <br>  There are those who think we should be sensitive to EVERYONE.  I don't think it's being insensitive for the U.S to simply acknowledge that English is our primary language period.  Yet somehow that offends people.  I'm sorry but that's just the way it is.  I don't travel to France and EXPECT the French people to speak English to me and put all their signs in English.  Yet for some reason America has gone batty for being "politically correct" to the point that it's idiotic in my opinion.  So yeah, I probably would get riled up if someone seemed upset that I didn't speak Spanish when we're in AMERICA for god's sake.|`|o25RxEQXaa	I live inn Napa and we have nothing, but mexicans working in the vineyards so a lot of people Speak spanish here including me.

The thing is its not our fault that we didnt grow up speaking our native language in our houses and I'm sure if you had the choice you would want to speak your native language, people think we might be ashamed of it-but rather its the hardest thing to deal with about your identity.

This just reaffirms why I feel so strongly that my mixed hispanic/caucasian daughter should learn spanish! I remember when I was in high school the kids that were Hispanic or even Mexican, that didn't speak fluent spanish, got made fun of. I put my daughter in the dual language program at her school to help her avoid ppl's stupidity, but I don't understand the obsession that some Mexican or other spanish speaking ppl have with others of spanish decent that cannot speak spanish. Maybe they think its a disgrace to the culture or something. Whatever the reason, its stupid to make someone feel bad for something they think is right.<br>  <br>  I definitely think I would be offended if someone thought that I had to live up to their standards as far as race is concerned! Just because you are Mexican or Hispanic or whatever your race may be, does not mean that you are REQUIRED to speak a certain language! This is 2009 and we live in AMERICA where the primary language IS (well at least it used to be) English so maybe you should have asked him why he didn't speak English since he's in America!|`|vF8JWEDTaa	I'm Mexican American and would be offended if I was asked not to speak spanish but, I think maybe he was just a little  ignorant and was stereotyping.

Qc6MqcpWaa	Okay, here's my story.<br>  <br>  When I was very young, I ate lots of meat and seafood. Around five or so, I became very curious as to what I was eating. What I found out disgusted me. I stopped eating all seafood around the age of 8 and only ate meat when I was forced to. Everybody thought I was crazy, that I wouldn't be able to do it and/or that I would get very sick. Nobody supported me, my parents threatened me several times, and my friends always put meat in my food when I wasn't looking. Nearly five years ago, I finally stopped eating meat all-together. Since that time, four of my friends that used to contaminate my food with meat and found it hysterical have become vegetarians themselves (two have been so for over two years now). My parents now also support me and try everything I eat, and have found that they also like a majority of meat-substitutes. I have to make my veggie BLT's often for my mom, and my brother is always stealing my vegan chicken nuggets. My dad and my mom's boyfriend only drink soymilk now.<br>  <br>  The moral of the story is: nobody can stop you. They might try, but whether you become a vegetarian right this second or years from now, it's still ultimately your choice. Just make sure that you are always getting enough protein mainly, but also vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium. These can be provided by supplements but it's more recommended that you drink soymilk, eat soy-based foods like veggie burgers, eat lentils, leafy green vegetables, beans, and nuts.<br>  <br>  My personal recommendations are Tofurky deli meats, Boca, and Morningstar products. If you choose to drink soymilk, I would definitely get Silk brand. Keep in mind, if you don't like one product, it does not necessarily mean you won't like anything else made by that brand. People have different preferences, so some products will taste as close to meat as you can possibly get, and others will taste nothing like it, or have the same taste but different texture, and vise versa. Also, tofu is a great thing to experiment with when starting out but everybody likes it cooked and prepared different ways; there's so many things you can do with it.<br>  <br>  I have so much respect for you making this choice despite what others are saying. Best of luck to you!|`|MXYWSsM7aa	Do you have an Asian food market close by? They'd have plenty of tofu. Please do some research on what foods to eat since you've decided to become a vegetarian. Also, talk to your doctor. Ask your mom to take you and the two of you can talk to him/her. Your mother is probably concerned about your health. I did the vegetarian thing one time when an old boyfriend wanted me to become one. I was young and didn't know what I should or shouldn't eat. I literally lost 20 lbs in one month. I looked awful. I went back to eating meat. In fact I love it. A little too much and so I've decided to eat less meat and more chicken and fish. Take care and God Bless. :)|`|b9e17f1222430e55dd4de26ca13cde6caa	Because vitamin B12 comes primarily from animal products, people who follow a strict vegetarian or vegan diet and do not consume eggs or dairy products may require vitamin B12 supplements. (Non-animal sources of vitamin B12 exist but are highly variable in their B12 content. They are considered unreliable sources of the vitamin.) Vitamin B12, like the other B vitamins, is important for metabolism.  It helps in the formation of red blood cells and in the maintenance of the central nervous system. Please understand that humans are omnivores and need to consume animal products to get the proper nutrition. Mad cow demonstrates exactly what happens when we pretend we have a better handle on nutrition than millions of years of survival. Feeding cattle to cattle, bad idea, feeding carrots to dogs, bad idea, strict vegetarianism, bad idea. None of the people who are in the top ten in human longevity were vegetarians, and none of the surviving individuals who is over 100 is a vegetarian. It's not the way we are built and anytime you have to dump supplements to make up for necessary nutrients because you aren't with it enough to make them a part of your diet, I'd have to consider that the wrong way to go. Now, vegetarians, you may start arguing about the "benefits".

Perhaps you should purchase a book on that subject and study what food combinations you can make to ensure adequate nutrition.  Once you've done this, you can show some recipes to your mother and explain why they will give you the nutrition you need (growing teens' bodies need LOTS of nutrients, so this aspect is CRUCIAL).  When she sees that you're serious about it, perhaps she'll get used to the idea and slowly permit you to incorporate vegetarian dishes into the family's meals.  On the days the family eats meat, perhaps you can make something for yourself.|`|AA12360579	I can understand her continuing to prepare meals with meat for dinner (my mother always told me to eat what she made or make something for myself), but that she refuses to buy you things to eat instead is silly.  Try to ask for more salads and whatnot--tofu might seem like too extreme of an idea for her to understand (and it is pretty nasty, in her defense).  If you go to restaurants, make a point of ordering salads or veggie burgers and whatnot.  Let her know that you feel extremely upset and you're very passionate about being a vegetarian.  Make sure you get vitamins too--humans are omnivores and we are designed to eat a varied diet.  If you don't get your proper vitamins, you could end up unhealthy.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't eat meat that often, but I do eat meat every now and then.  Being a vegetarian is harrrd.
xWGJHMkuaa	How you feel or where you are, always use the verb Estar!<br>  <br>  One saying that can help, but it's very basic.

93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	The closer your life approaches Christlike, the more opposition you can expect to face.  Thus, the ultimate sacrifice has been paid by many prophets when faced with the ultimate challenge.  They stood faithful to their testimonies and died as a result.<br>  Will you have to die for your testimony?  Probably not.  However, you will be called upon somewhere in your life to make the ultimate sacrifice for the Lord.  What will that be?  Nobody knows but the Lord.  Each of us has a different sacrifice to make.  It will  hit us at our weak point.  Will be strong enough to obey the Lord and not give in to the challenge?  That is for us to find out.<br>  Abraham was asked to sacrifice Isaac.  He passed the test.<br>  Samuel the Lamanite was asked to preach to the wicked Nephites.  He passed the test.<br>  Abinadi was asked to preach to the wicked King Noah.  He passed.<br>  Heber C. Kimball was asked to give his wife to Joseph.  He passed the test and the sacrifice was not required, just as Abraham's sacrifice was also rescinded.<br>  It is up to you to live your life in accordance to the teachings of the Lord and his prophets so that when the challenge does come in your life, you will be able to stand firm in the testimony of Jesus and continue to walk forward, in spite of the opposition.<br>  Best wishes|`|AA11713693	Yes it is possible but don't go over board.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	We have a great calling today that differs from Abinadi.<br>  <br>  Abinadi died for his message not knowing that the priest who ran out of the room would become Alma, leader of the church, great great great great grandfather of the prophet who was serving when Christ came.  His life was given to the gospel in the way God needed (or rather allowed as Noah demanded).<br>  <br>  We are asked by Paul in Romans 12 to be living sacrifices to God.  That means we do what we can and what we're asked.<br>  <br>  To me it's getting up early to teach seminary every day.  To my wife it's a Relief society lesson each month.  To my dad it's donating all of his time and efforts to the church rather than retiring to be with his family and enjoy the comfort that business success might have afforded him.  To another it's collecting hymn books.  But no person doing their calling needs to feel any less than Abinadi.<br>  <br>  If we do what God asks us to do then we've followed Abinadi.  Which reminds me, I've been gone most of the month and so home-teaching needs to be done this weekend.  That's how we give our life to the Lord, moments here and there becoming closer to Him.<br>  <br>  Great question.|`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	Stand ready to follow the path even with the flames, but remember his role as prophet was a part of his calling.

Course this means that you'll have to be more of a missionary. You'll have to study your scriptures more so you know your sciptures so you can confound those who say otherwise. You'd also have to spend a lot of time on your knees in prayer.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	take it from a witness who was/is both LDS and born again protestant. <br>  <br>  the minute a person says they see Jesus, they are open to all forms of tribulation and discrimination and hatred. <br>  there are secret combinations that will "SEEK" to destroy you<br>  there are satan worshippers that will seek to kill you. <br>  at least that is my experience. ALSO among those that have a testimony among the heathen and the pagan and 666 management, you will lose more jobs than find them.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	You know, it's not really necessary for us to die horribly in order to give our lives for the gospel.  Don't you think that God honors those who live faithfully and spread the knowledge of the gospel to others just as much as He does those who were martyred for it?  <br>  <br>  Think of the three Nephites--while the other Apostles at that time wanted only to be welcomed back to God, like John the Beloved, they wanted to continue living and bringing souls to Christ.  Christ said that though the other Apostles would be blessed, the three would be "more blessed" for their dedication to their brethren and to the gospel (3 Nephi 28:7). <br>  <br>  And though the rest of us can't live until Christ comes again, think of Gordon B. Hinckley.  The man lived a long time, but he was one of our most beloved prophets for a reason.  His example and efforts helped bring the gospel to thousands.  He died peacefully after over ninety years on this earth, but I really, really don't believe God welcomed the prophet any less joyfully than He did Abinadi.  And remembering the prophet, knowing how much God loved him and how proud God probably was for his efforts, can you really still wonder if giving our lives for the gospel isn't possible in today's world?  <br>  <br>  Of course it takes great courage and dedication to become a martyr for God, but in so many ways, I think it actually takes more to live and still spread knowledge of Christ.  The living have to give every single day to Christ; we have to be in the world and yet still keep our priorities straight, still help others find the Savior.  We have to endure to the end when the end isn't necessarily in sight, and while I revere Abinadi for his sacrifices and fully believe he would have endured to the end had he lived, we also need to recognize those who give their lives to Christ rather than just their deaths.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	A few are asked to die for His cause, but most are asked to LIVE for it.|`|AGKOaVEkaa	Yup

BPO6roTOaa	Pro-Choice. And Pro-choice is not pro-abortion, let's all be clear on that.|`|iVU7beMuaa	Both.  <br>  <br>  Babies don't come without women making the choice to act in a way that may result in the creation of life (rape being the only reasonable exception of babies coming with out women making said choice).  If a fetus is capable of sustaining life after birth it should be allowed to do so.<br>  <br>  Bridged that divide.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADDITION:  I love the argument claiming men shouldn't be involved in this discussion because we can't have babies.  Kind of like arguing that US citizens shouldn't be involved in discussing China's atrocities on her own people.  We're not Chinese citizens after all...<br>  <br>  AND ANOTHER ADDITION:  I also love the argument that somehow believing the death penalty is moral under certain circumstances and being involved in apparently any war makes a person unable to have their convictions of the sanctity of unborn life validated by some.  Yes, believing that someone who has been tried and convicted of a heinous crime, and sentenced to death, or considering armed force as a method to protect one's life, liberty, country, and family from enemies makes a person in no way morally able to make a stand against the destruction of an individual as a fetus, before he or she has so much as drawn breath, by his or her own mother.  Those pro-lifers are such hypocrites.|`|O8n3FYK0aa	Pro-life, let me ask you something, when does an unborn child become a human being?

dcDY9pJeaa	to specifically answer your question,  the "tool" is not flawed,  the people who use it sometimes abuse it and give phony data or misinterpret reality,  but within the tool of science is a mechanism for correction,<br>  <br>  the whole point is to learn,  we don't know everything about everything,<br>  <br>  so that's my answer|`|euHZPsQYaa	Dude, I just read one of your answers to a question.<br>  <br>  You need to better define "flawed" though. I mean, it isn't perfect, but the very idea of science, and the way it works, is meant to be self-correcting. If you do something wrong, it's going to get noticed and corrected. It's kind of the very idea of why science is so beautiful. It can be questioned and challenged, and when it is, we discover either we're right (so far) or something is wrong, and needs to be changed.<br>  <br>  And, what does whoever mean by "Evolution is flawed?" The phrase "survival of the fittest" doesn't mean "the strongest will win." It only means, those with traits that allowed them to survive long enough to reproduce will survive. White rabbit in the woods isn't going to live very long because it keeps getting eaten, you know.|`|AA10556726	That's a really broad question as "science" is a very big subject and there are many practicing scientists.  The major point to science is that it tries to be self critical and correcting.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Science allows for error and thus nothing is considered 100% proven, and more importantly nothing is considered unchallengeable.   This is a major strength of science when compared to religion.  It can be challenged and changed as we learn more, whereas religion ignores its errors and claims that corrected beliefs were always true - for example, look at how many Christians try to rationalize OT slavery as indentured servitude or ignore that divorcees getting remarried is just as sinful as homosexuals.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	All things that are from man is flawed. If you look at the scientific discoveries over lets say the last two centuries, you will see where man has often found that assumptions made before were incorrect. Science is a process, not a goal. It can not EVER be considered the final word on anything...because it is constantly changing.|`|dFrMhJxUaa	Science is not flawed, just incomplete, as technology improves, or a new technology is invented, science will always improve it's self with new data. Now religion is flawed, but don't want to get into right now.|`|M6VcuiyDaa	Yes but only because humans are flawed. If we were perfect then science would be perfect.<br>  <br>  Science is self-correcting as long as the scientists can admit it when they make mistakes.|`|czf6uhIraa	Hmmm... What kind of science are we talking about here?  If it's Creation science then yes, it's very flawed.|`|fbrdhY1aaa	Yes, but only because we don't have all the answers.|`|c6mG9bIiaa	Some science is, some isn't.

Has science been able to stop wars, famine, poverty, any of the chaos we find in the world today? <br>   All science has done is created a race of super sped-up, impatient, restless and frustrated people. We are so addicted to technology, and we are told that the more we acquire of this new technology, the more time it's gonna save us, but in fact, the opposite is true! All we are doing is creating more frantic people who have no patience. We want everything instantly. And the more information we are acquiring, the less we are taking in. We are the "information age", but information is not the same as KNOWLEDGE or WISDOM.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	>>Well yes, I know some things in science are flawed, but I am just asking about things that are 100% proven.<<<br>  <br>  If something is 100% proven, how can it be flawed?|`|LnoyylQ7aa	yes how dare they get rid of hollow earth, it sounds so cool

RaCHwb9caa	If you are doing as I think and just getting some opinions about the situation. Good for you it is always advisable to research a bit before drawing any conclusion. The advice here is good and some irrelevant but you are moving in a positive direction. It doesn't seem like you have jumped the gun yet but it does appear that you are preparing to. Think twice before you send this person into a situation that very well may be purely a medical one. ~D~|`|8d8ejHPfaa	It does sound like it could be sleep apnea, which is very scary to listen to up close and personal.  Especially if the father has health concerns, if he is overweight, or has breathing problems in general, he should be checked out at a sleep lab....One of the problems with sleep apnea, is that it causes the sleeper to stop breathing and often interrupts rem sleep, if he is being shocked out of rem sleep with a sudden interruption of breathing that could possibly be causing an hallucination to sort of "explain" why he can't breathe... It's also possible he could have a form of sleep paralysis called "Old Hag Syndrome", this is a kind of sleep paralysis that is accompanied by hallucinations of other worldly spirits in the room or bed with you, sometimes sitting on the chest.  If a person has sleep paralysis in general, it could cause him to panic and that could cause a feeling of tightness in the chest, they really should get him to a doctor about it.<br>  I don't really think it's a succubus, but on the off chance it is,is the father widowed, or gone through a bad divorce?  Perhaps he needs more company during the day...|`|326183ad638c65397360f6a4dcc9abfaaa	call TAPS.  they'll do an investigation & find out what it is.|`|CMjSkDOMaa	I'm not sure how you got from sleep apnea or some other condition to succubus but okay.

And praying in the name of Jesus is the ONLY THING that made this "thing" go away so that tells me what I experienced was some sort of demonic presense.<br>  <br>  However, if your online friend's father's case, nobody can know for sure until there is some further spiritual investigating into the matter. You might even want to have a Roman Catholic priest come bless the houe, his bed and HIM with holy water, I'm serious.

Now we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to do this more and more.

The Lord will punish men for all such sins, as we have already told you and warned you. For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life.

But there are many things that cannot or have not been proven by science.  Believing in things that haven't been explained doesn't make someone a fool, though there are fools throughout society, including the scientific community.

To the Roman Church and many other Christian denominations, marriage is a sacrament, that is a holy order, and the sacrament, according to the Church, must be administered by a Christian priest/minister.<br>  <br>  Much of the Catholic thinking concerning marriage of Catholics stems from the Pauline letters in the New Testament, which cautions believers and unbelievers not to "be unequally yoked together."

I would feel that I killed something innocent.<br>  I cannot answer a definite yes or a no - but if there is no father and I cannot support the child, I may go with abortion because I would be too emotionally attached by the end of 9 months.|`|7AUqSr4uaa	i think initially, i would say 'i'd have an abortion', but no-one knows how they are going to feel when they find out there is a little life inside them.<br>  <br>  if i decided to have it, i dont think i would give it up for adoption, because i would love it anyway, not the babys fault it was conceived in such a way.<br>  <br>  if i feared i could not look after the baby properly, then i would adopt, but only as a last resort.<br>  <br>  i dont think anyone can truely know how they would feel until it happened to them.|`|kDUBuBxnaa	No, I wouldn't give the baby away.

ehBPus3Zaa	Hey, girl!  I was always taught that we should watch what we put into our minds by word or song. If we listen to something that doesn't edify God, then it will  take hold somewhere in our minds. My mother always said if you fill it with the things of God, then you won't have room for giving into temptation, or to want to do the things that the world does that can tear our souls down. Then we start feeling guilty about whatever we have done or listened to, and then feelings of not being good enough enters. We will possibly even start to fall away from God if we give the devil place within our lives. <br>  <br>  I thought differently when I was a teenager and didn't listen to my mother, and always argued this point. (among other points she would make about dating unsaved guys)  I have since learned that she knew what she was talking about. Maybe I just grew up and saw that she had experienced what she was trying to tell me not to do and wanted to spare me the pain.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	God gives discernment in what kind of music to listen to.|`|EOQ03aAeaa	In the 20's, the Blues was called the devil's music.

KdRpLTXBaa	You are arguing a point like the Pharisees did with Christ.  You are missing the point entirely.  God does not believe people can reach Him with a tower!  The purpose of the tower of Babel reference in the the bible is to show that man was gaining ingenuity and began to think that his power and knowledge could accomplish spiritual objectives.  Sounds similar to what we do today.  People accomplish great things and expect God to credit them for it.  According to the bible that is a totally wrong perception of self and God.  God humbled the people of that time by confusing and creating languages.  Don't miss the value of that story by doubting God and disputing over things the story never intended.  |`|aac2aafaea3f3e84eae2f7b3c6f3a02eaa	Did you know that Babel and Babylon are the same in the Hebrew?<br>  Did you know the final form of human government to be destroyed in the last days is called Babylon the Great?<br>  <br>  It appears to me men will do exactly as you say - try to attain immortality and be like God by their own power and ability; and God will bring the whole sorry mess down, never again to arise.|`|NUOQ7Q8Gaa	Unfortunately you must have some type of brains to read the Bible.

Being an Agnostic or an Atheist is to be more open minded or level headed as I take it. Of course shoving any sort of belief down someones throat is wrong regardless of what it is. The problem with religion is that many use it as a form of oppression. Even making up new rules as they go to benefit those in charge. Look at Islam and fundamentalist Christians and Mormons. Women, girls and homosexuals don't have a chance, which I believe is wrong. It is simply a form of oppression. People have used it for power since the beginning of time. In some ways it could considered an organized form of "hate" since it can turn so many people against each other that other wise would get along and work together. It really should'nt matter what you believe as long as you don't hate your neighbor for being different and as long as you don't disrupt the community simply for your belief. We all know what is right and wrong, Treat your neighbor as you would wish to be treated and live right everyday. you don't need religion to tell you that.|`|e4tvh1d2aa	do you know what it is?<br>  agnostisim is only refusing to give an opinion on a subject without all of the facts in.<br>  being agnostic about god<br>  is saying that you can not yet say that either sieds evidence meets your<br>  burden of proof to a degree that makes you say one way or the other on gods existance.<br>  <br>  how can this harm the world?<br>  wait.. i can see it if your christian, any thought beyond what you are told<br>  is dangerous.|`|7KeGDQyXaa	Hitler was NOT a christian :) he was an atheist and  a proponent of eugenics. he was breeding the master raise and eliminating the so called less desirable people.|`|czdCtTvWaa	Why do you think this is?....

No, because even if you are sincere with this question, then you are so unbelievably lost and blind, clinging to a man-made book containing a man-made fairytale, that praying with you is to condone your closed mind and make even more real for you something that just simply does not exist.|`|204ea044164bff3317a2149a138abff7aa	They are asking dumb questions.

I have the answer to your question:<br>  1. Your thumb is closest to you, so begin your prayers by praying for those closest to you. They are the easiest to remember.<br>  2. The next finger is the pointer finger. Pray for those who teach, instruct and heal - teachers, doctors, and ministers. They need support and wisdom in pointing others in the right direction.<br>  3. Next is the tallest finger, to remind us of our leaders. Pray for the president, leaders in business and industry, and administrators. They guide our nation and public opinion and need God's guidance.<br>  4. Next is our ring finger, surprisingly, our weakest finger. It reminds us to pray for those who are weak, lost, in trouble or in pain. They need your prayers day and night.<br>  5. And last is the pinky. Which is where we should place ourselves in relation to God and others. The Bible says, "The least shall be the greatest among you." Your pinky reminds you to pray for yourself. After you've prayed for the other four groups, your own needs will be put into perspective.
5pEgUh55aa	Yeah, that's what R & S can do to people! Sometimes I take a break and go off and do other things - get in touch with reality, get some fresh air and exercise, read a good book. Then, with my mental, physical and spiritual batteries recharged, jump back into the fray.<br>  <br>  I can't advise you on what to believe, what to laugh at and what to be serious about.

They just want to have their mind rest on past reality as presented to them.  They believed on what the past had in calculated in their minds and don't want to accept the present truth which is the reality of hope. The hope of eternal life. They thought that reality that had been set in their minds is the limit. They don't have the guts to accept that reality is limitless. Acceptance of reality is on going while we are still on this earth. Daniel 12:4 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. The increase of knowledge is continues until the end of time. Only the knowledge of God does not changed because He is the same yesterday, today and forever. Facts and theories are changing from time to time. As the theory of Darwin that God had not created man. There are facts that disclaimed this now. But God never increased or decreased He is still the all powerful and the Almighty God of Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac. This is the reality that remained to be constant. And this is the strength of every believer. And our hope lies on the promise of God to send back Jesus Christ our Lord and Redeemer. He had redeemed us from this world of sin and He will be coming back to bring us to the kingdom of our Father God unto everlasting life. And the best thing we have now is the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in us. He will guide us to all truths the reality of things to come. He will protect us from evil and convict us when we commit sin. This is the reality unbelievers could hardly accept because they are close minded. If only they would open their hearts to these truths and I am sure their minds just follow the dictates of their hearts. If only they could love the Lord whom they have hated for so many years this world will be a great place for every one of us to live in. May the good Lord soften the hearts of every unbeliever. God will heal this world before the coming of His Son Jesus Christ. So be it.|`|c90dx5Doaa	i do believe this question is hateful of "nonbelievers" but i guess that all depends if you're talking as simply someone of religion or someone of a specific religion wait no it doesn't either way it's basically calling atheists dumb|`|ATsdSM7saa	Reality is all that is real. <br>  If you see things that are not real, perhaps you should see a doctor.|`|QQ2rTaPdaa	Nothing beyond reality is real.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	Yes, there aren't many real things outside of reality.|`|AA11946554	What are you talking about?

"He was considered the first of seven men who, by their merits, brought back the Shekina, so that it could take up its abode in the tabernacle. We are told, more4over, that Abraham began to serve God at the age of three, and that his righteousness was made complete by his circumcision and his anticipatory fulfillment of the law" (Hendriksen, 145).  <br>  <br>  And here is The Book of Jubilees, 23:10, written in about the 2nd century BC: "Abraham was perfect in all his deeds with the Lord, and well-pleasing in righteousness all the days of his life (23:10)(Hendriksen, 145).<br>  <br>  God singled this man out to be the means of blessing to all people. Let us look closely at the call of this first missionary.<br>  <br>  . . . Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing.

They were all righteous and had FAITH in GOD without any written "LAW" of religion. The law was written in their heart. Concerning Abrahams son, his first born Ishmael was a child of a slave. He represented the old testament: Judaism & Islam. They are "slaves" of the law. The law was given to keep the people in check. It was given for the sinners so they might know what sin is and have no alibi or excuse for their actions.  law is like a mirror and reflects your character according to the standard that God, Jehovah set. Very important though the law does not promise life after death. Abrahams second sonIsaac was  the promised child, he was a miracle child. For sarah was approximetly 90 yrs old and believed she was barren. This alone forshadows things to come. Jesus was the promised son of God whom he said he would send to free humankind from bondage. Jesus was also a miracle child. Isaac represents the New Testament. These are the two witnesses or covenants of God with mankind. The old & new testament. Jesus did not come to make the Old testament obsolete he came to make it true. For he is mentioned plenty of times in the old covenant. Think of being a parent. When you child is young there are rules to form his/her character. When he/she comes of age the rules are changed and become more lenient but that does not mean the 1st set of rules are obsolete beause they are the foundation of the character. This is the purpose of the old and new testament. At the time of Christ people as a whole were spiritually matured and ready for the next step to reconcile with God. It was made much easier. Jesus wrote the law of god in the hearts of man. Abraham and other I mentioned earlier on were at this stage very early but the time was right for everyone. First obedience was forced upon mankind by rituals and laws then we were given a choice to adhere. This is an awesome example of the love, dedication and patience of God with his creations. God works in mysterious ways. His thoughts are higher than ours like the heavens are higher tha the earth. At the time His agenda was misunderstood but the result was miraculous.<br>  Praise the almighty living God, Jehovah, creator of the heavens, earth and all creatures. It was written. Ahmen|`|AA10522123	God didn't switch from Isaac to Ishmael.<br>  The Jews are descendants of Abraham’s son Isaac. The Arabs are descendants of Abraham’s son Ishmael. With Ishmael being the son of a slave woman (Genesis 16:1-16) and Isaac being the promised son who would inherit the promises to Abraham (Genesis 21:1-3), obviously there would be some animosity between the two sons. As a result of Ishmael mocking Isaac (Genesis 21:9), Sarah talked Abraham into sending Hagar and Ishmael away (Genesis 21:11-21). Likely this caused even more contempt in Ishmael’s heart towards Isaac. An angel even prophesied to Hagar that Ishmael would “live in hostility toward all his brothers” (Genesis 16:11-12).<br>  Why Abraham?<br>   the Bible Abraham is known as a man of faith. When the Lord called him to leave his country to go to a land He would show him, he obeyed. The Lord made a covenant with him and promised that he would be the father of many nations and have many descendants.|`|AA11365805	I am curious where you read that God changed.

SO Islam did not come from Ismael! Despite what people claim. In fat Mohamed and Joseph Smith of the Latter Day Saints have very similar stories so if you believe in Islam,, why not Mormonism? (although I do have much respect for both religions) They were never connected to any prophets or even smart/learned people, they just claim to have seen visions, which to me is not an argument. Islam (unlike LDS) converted MOST people by force and that to me is a huge red falg.<br>  <br>  Generation of Isaac did not fail (look at Israel, look at Europe and look at the living conditions most people are in in the Arab countries, isn't it obviouse who failed?) <br>  <br>  "God switched" means God is not perfect means by defenition there is no God.<br>  <br>  Why Abraham? Well, you'll know when you talk to God, His thought process is a HUGE mystery to me.<br>  <br>  hope this helps, I was not trying to be offencive just stating the facts as I see them. PS I'm not affiliated with any religion.

a19e9fdff944fb9fffd084103b5ae11eaa	It might help you to look at the Bible as a book of parables and examples of what a "god" might wish humanity to be and the rules it wants us to follow, but not follow it as if it were an instruction manual for life.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you may be looking at the people around you, then reading about the idealized characters in the Bible, and thinking, wow, these people in the real world are nothing like these people in the Bible, therefore something must be wrong with them and I must point this out. <br>  <br>  You don't necessarily have to.  I would suggest using the Bible as a tool from which to glean wisdom, not as a rulebook to call out those who may not be following what are not necessarily rules but rather suggested guidelines for living.

I was told I was going somewhere/doing something as a child, and I had enough respect for my parents to do as they say. It was not a matter of believing; It's what everyone else did.

My life was indeed the same the day after I made the decision to quit attending church.|`|AA11788494	I didn't like attending church with people I didn't like and I didn't like not understanding what I was being taught.

As for me,<br>  I have chosen faith.<br>  <br>  I have become a believer in God because:<br>  <br>  1. Design. Our body's are masterpieces, our universe has order, the probability that it came by randomness is simply nonsense.<br>  <br>  Argument from Personal Incredulity. Our universe does have order and our bodies are indeed masterpieces, and you're right that it didn't come from "randomness". Natural Selection is the opposite of random, and there's a perfectly good natural explanation for how such complex life came to be. You don't need to resort to the supernatural. <br>  <br>  2. I take the Gospel accounts as eye witnesses. Jesus wouldn't lie, his demeanor speaks much of him.<br>  <br>  It's a fact, agreed upon by almost every Biblical scholar you're likely to find, that the Gospel accounts ARE NOT eyewitness accounts. The earliest Gospel, Mark, was written several decades after Jesus's death. And Mark was most likely based on an even earlier source. <br>  <br>  3. I've witness (with my own eyes) the transformation Christ has had in my life, the life of my family, my friends, and strangers.<br>  <br>  I can't deny this, but don't expect me to believe because of a personal experience you or people you know had. People in other parts of the world, worshipping completely different gods, experience similar transformations.  <br>  <br>  4. My faith has taught ME to love and tolerate all peoples, including those whom I disagree.<br>  <br>  Great! I also tolerate all peoples, including those with whom I disagree, and I didn't need a holy book to tell me to do it. <br>  <br>  5. It has caused me to become more rational, I have matured immensely as a result of my faith. Both philosophically and scientifically.<br>  <br>  I'll take your word for it. <br>  <br>  6. I have a set of morals and a will to live life.<br>  <br>  Me too, and they come from my understanding of reality and my ability to empathize with other people rather than the dictates of a god. I also have a will to live life, because as far as I know it's the only one I have, and I want to make it count. <br>  <br>  7. This ancient document has taught me to respect and love those who persecute me.<br>  <br>  It's not bad advice. The Bible is full of good advice, actually. It's also full of bad advice. If you believe that it's all infallible (not saying you do personally, but some people do), how do you separate the good from the bad? <br>   <br>  8. I love the idea of a God who cares and is interested in everything I do.<br>  <br>  That would be nice. Just because the idea is comforting doesn't mean that it's true. <br>  <br>  9. I love the idea that God forgives and does things for our well being.<br>  <br>  I like that idea too. I would be comfortable worshiping such a god. However, the god of the Bible is not that god. The sin of unbelief is a sin he does not forgive, and sends people (or lets people send themselves) to be tortured for all eternity. And apparently there's nothing he can do to change the rules, even though he created the entire universe and everything in it.|`|rCBRTlGhaa	Ok here goes<br>  <br>  1. Our bodies are a product of the evolutionary process not from some fictional god that "created" a substandard product.<br>  <br>  2. The gospels were written decades to centuries after this supposed jesus character was said to walk the earth.<br>  <br>  3. Luck and good fortune are not the hand of some fictional god.<br>  <br>  4. Faith is the art of not thinking logically about those things that science has supplied answers to.<br>  <br>  5. Maturity can only be achieved with age and experience.<br>  <br>  6. Morality is not given to us by a fictional god, but through an advanced set of evolutionary traits that have developed over a Milena. <br>  <br>  7.

There can only be one true answer or in this case one true book. I believe the Bible to be 100 percent TRUE regardless of what anybody thinks. The Bible is a Holy Book. It is the Word of God. And rather than give you my opinions I would rather you READ about what the BOOK SAYS for ITSELF. Since your question was asking what to read and about how to commit yourself to God I would to say the Book of Romans because it explains itself very well and it stands by itself without having to read through the gospels or the book of Acts. You could simply start out by reading Romans Chapter 1 verse 1 and follow it through to the end. I use to keep a notepad and pen to write down anything I didnt understand or come back to later.

MvZMA5BGaa	The laws of karma and reincarnation are man made and wretched.<br>  If you travel to a places in the world where people truly believe, you will find the true nature of it and how it holds people in it's grip.<br>  Thanks to lack of education and with the help of men like Deepak Chopra, <br>  Westerners have a very watered down idea of it.<br>  Take for example a person that has caused much destruction - Hitler, for example, as his name always comes up. Karma and reincarnation teaches that upon his death, the bad karma he accumulated goes on into another life but the recipient has no idea of the weight they are carrying. Hitler's soul could be reincarnated into another person, animal or insect. There are some people that wear mouth and nose coverings to avoid breathing someone in. (I'm not joking.)<br>  In countries where karma rules the day and homeless children roam the street, other citizens do nothing to help them. Not because they are cruel but because the child has accumulated bad karma and they believe the sooner the child dies he can begin again. I saw a news article a few years back about a heartbroken mother that had lost her 13 year son to an early death. Just after the funeral, an iguana walked into her home. The photo showed her with tears rolling down her face as she held it - because she was convinced it was her son reincarnated. <br>  I stronly suggest the book by Ravi Zacharais called "Jesus Among Other Gods". He was raised in India and has a clear understanding of these things - and he takes strong offense to the tripe dished out by Deepak Chopra|`|AA11559018	from the looks of it, there is a little something to karma|`|mD7CaSDJaa	yeah, i believe in karma. i think you get what you give, if you are a bad person (cheating, stealing, bad attitude, harming others -be it physical, emotional,etc) it will eventually catch up to you. good actions will also be repaid, although it may take time before it happens. i don't think karma is instant for the most part. |`|3a4381b377051aafb1d028a6be67b494aa	I have seen it over and over again.

SMIryuWEaa	Agnostic- You admit that you don't know what is up there, or even if there is anything up there. This is the big question mark of religion.<br>  <br>  Deism- Belief that God created the universe but now has no active role in it. <br>  <br>  Theism- The belief in a god.|`|eXxZEYDCaa	Agnosticism is the position of believing that knowledge of the existence or non-existence of God is impossible. It is often put forth as a middle ground between theism and atheism. Understood this way, agnosticism is skepticism regarding all things theological. The agnostic holds that human knowledge is limited to the natural world, that the mind is incapable of knowledge of the supernatural. Understood this way, an agnostic could also be a theist or an atheist. The former is called a fideist, one who believes in God purely on faith. The latter is sometimes accused by theists of having faith in the non-existence of God, but the accusation is absurd and the expression meaningless. The agnostic atheist simply finds no compelling reason to believe in God.|`|jnHwmvSkaa	People often are confused about this. An agnostic believes that there IS a god. In fact, it's possible to be a Christian and an agnostic. They just believe that it's impossible to know the nature of god. <br>  <br>  Lots of people who call themselves agnostic are really atheist. Being atheist doesn't mean you're certain there is no god (I'm not certain), it means that you have doubts. A "strong atheist" is someone who is certain there's no god.|`|6709f9f8b081a814a21bfcf6aade68e3aa	In a nutshell, an agnostic believes that god is unknowable or cannot be proven.

Usually they use the term "greater power" because it's seen more as a force than a being or deity.They usually believe in something along those lines, but it mostly is like saying you are unsure of your beliefs. Embracing that there's a possibility of something out there, but not for sure. Non-commital.

Tu serais très malheureux d'être autrement.   Etre bon vivant a ses avantages car lorsque tu seras mort il n'y aura pas plus d'options.  Après la mort tu es gay ou hétéro?  Tout le monde s'en fou un peu n'est-ce pas!|`|2b44a95e28ab549f15b86b5c129eb9deaa	Bon, pour moi, l'homosexualité c'est une pratique sexuelle. Ceux qui te disent que c'est dans le désir, je trouve que c'est réducteur. Je suis gay et j'ai déjà éprouvé du désir pour des nanas, mais je ne suis jamais passé à l'act.<br>  <br>  Ensuite, je pense que de se poser cette question, ?a permet d'avoir une sexualité saine et assumée. Peut importe ce que tu deviendras. Si tu deviens hétéro, au moins tu le seras en pleine conscience de tes désirs. Et si tu deviens homo, tu auras réfléchi à ta sexualité pour la définir.<br>  <br>  Et puis il y  a des tas d'hétéros (pas assez à mon sens) qui font l'expérience de l'homosexualité! c'est pas un crime, ?a peut correspondre à une recherche de soi, à un désir à un moment particulier de sa vie.<br>  <br>  De toute fa?on, pour moi tout est une question de choix. Si l'homosexualité représente un tabou trop important pour toi, et malgré tes inclinaisons, tu la rejetteras et deviendras hétéros. Certains diront un refoulé, pour moi, encore une fois, l'homosexualité est une pratique et ceux qui font le choix de ne pas "passer à l'acte" ne sont jamais des homos.|`|962a0c5254d897a236d1547bd19b75e7aa	Ma choupinette laisse moi te dire une chose aime, aime et aime.......n'écoute pas cnb et claire qui dans un registre complètement différent sont facho à leur manière. Tu te cherche c'est normal, tu trouveras ce qui est bon pour toi le moment venu. Je suis une maman désespérément hétéro mais j'ai eu vers 20 ans des attirances saphique mais au final il me manquait qqchose : un HOMME. <br>  Donc aime toi aime la vie et peut importe le regard des autres si tu aimes tu es dans le vrai|`|LNWZA19Waa	Entièrement d'accord avec les propos de EL GARFIO.

Etant homo, c'est vrai qu'avec du recul, même à l'adolescence je savais au fond de moi ce que j'étais. <br>  Si tu ressens une certaine attirance pour les personnes du même sexe que toi, ou même pour une seule personne, en effet il est normal de te poser des questions Mais tu sais ?a n'a rien de grave tout ?a. Ne gache pas une partie de ta vie juste parce que ?a t'effraies ; crois-moi je parle en connaisance de cause. Il y a des choses tellement plus graves que l'homosexualité, ou bisexualité si tel est ton cas. Vis ta vis. Suis ton instinct et tes désirs. Tu ne pourras en être que plus heureux.|`|t1EFEIa0aa	Je trouve pas ?a idiot du tout, ta réaction est normal, enfin à mes yeux parce que j'ai eu la même. A 17ans je suis tombée en admiration pour une fille, j'essayais de me persuader que c'était juste une attirance intellectuelle, parce que je ne pouvais pas être amoureuse d'elle. Je ne le pouvais pas parce que c'est les gar?ons que je devais aimer. Alors je me suis mentie à moi même et à tel point que je suis effectivement tombée amoureuse d'un gar?on, et avec le recul je sais que j'ai fait ce choix pour être tranquille, pour être dans cette foutue norme. Et puis ?a m'a rattrapé, doucement, et petit à petit j'ai fini par accepter. Mais c'est d?r et il m'arrive encore de douter...<br>  Pour répondre précisement à ta question je pense qu'on peut être s?r d'être homo à l'adolescence, et que ce n'est pas parce que l'on est en pleine construction, ou que l'on cherche à se différentier, qu'il faut croire qu'inconsciemment ce que l'on ressent est un moyen de s'opposer à ce modèle qui nous agace à ses parents qui nous plombent. <br>  On peut être s?r d'être homo à 15 ans parce que c'est une évidence, on peut être en phase de l'accepter ce qui est difficile, ou on peut juste se poser des questions. <br>  Après, comment en être s?r ? Est-ce que tu as vraiment besoin de l'être ? De toutes les manières, je pense que tu le sais, en ce qui me concerne à 17 ans je le savais déjà, mais je ne voulais pas me l'avouer. Oui en fait je crois que tu connais la réponse à ta question mais que tu ne l'acceptes pas encore.|`|1OOHFhuDaa	Tu peux être bisexuel aussi... as-tu de l'attirance uniquement pour les gar?ons?|`|5hDNgADHaa	L'adolescence est en effet une période un peu chahutée où l'on se cherche. Mais je trouve déjà très positif que tu te poses es questions. Pour le reste, laisses toi guider par ton instinct. être homosexuel, je ne pense pas que ce soit "juste" être attiré par quelqu'un du même sexe, c'est au delà du sexuel. Beaucoup d'adolescent n'ont pas ton questionnement, ils foncent et se cassent souvent la gueule. Ne précipite rien. Et même si tu devais avoir une aventure homosexuelle, cela ne voudrait pas encore dire que tu es définitivement homo mais que tu as été assez ouvert à un moment de ta vie pour vivre cette expérience.<br>  Bonne chance la réponse est dans ton coeur.<br>  Une chose est importante, sors toujours protégé car une vie on en a qu'une.<br>  Bisous<br>  Ria|`|AA11554533	Selon mon cours de psychologie, il est normal et courant pour des adolescents d'expérimenter des attirances homosexuelles durant, justement, l'adolescence.<br>  <br>  Quant à moi, j'ai vaguement expérimenté des attirances hétérosexuelles à l'adolescence – je suis homo, et je l'ai su depuis... pfou. Bien longtemps avant l'adolescence.<br>  <br>  Ainsi, ne te pose pas trop de questions. Avec le temps, tu y verras plus clair. Et si tu es homo, il n'y a pas de stress à avoir...

Et méme si c le cas ca veut pas dire que t homo. Il parait que chaque homme a une part féminine et reciproquement. Et puis la bisexualitée assumée ou pas (plutot pas en génerale) est un fait. Donc no stress tu peut fantasmé sur un mec de temp a autre mais au final kiffé les femmes.

865bVfl3aa	Your elders are human and have done what humans sometimes do. They let their opinions overwhelm them. MySpace has shown it's self to be an unusually dangerous form of communication. That doesn't mean, however, that a Witness can not have one. You are 18 and can make your own decisions. If you live with your parents you should consider their feelings, but even then it really is just your decision to make.<br>  Your elders surely mean well, but have just overstepped their bounds. It would be mature of you to be respectful and at least not make a big deal about your having a MySpace. <br>  It sounds to me like the "straining the gnat" has damaged your relationship with Jehovah. I have been there. Just study and pray and build a personal relationship with Jehovah. When the elders do something silly (not wrong, just silly) just smile and move on.|`|ch8DC4z7aa	I think the best people to ask this question to are those in your congregation who say you can't have one...................Or the parents that brought you up as a JW don't you think?|`|f1ycXGuHaa	Humans aren't your master.

They can change rules if it benefits them and etc.  The people ARE nice, but they are highly controlled...it's sad.|`|FTGoA0E0aa	I also as a fellow JW used to have one.The elders are just concernd how we might misuse it. For example, most of the time on myspace a lot of the brother/sisters were caught with inapropiate pictures and using vulgar language on there profiles..which mad them shocked of what we could be hiding.<br>  <br>  They also see it as chatting which is waayyy worse!! I don't think they know any of the good things about myspace..like maybe we could be pretching to one of our classmates.They just hear all the bad things on the news about it like rapes in such.<br>  <br>  I personally liked myspace since it kept me in contact with other JW or family memebers that lived far but i didnt want my pioneer privliged 2 be takin away because of a website i was barely using.<br>  <br>  I had it so my default was like a flower or something but only my friends could see my real default on my profile.So i could of gotten away with it.They couldnt have any evidence that i had one unless they went through one of my friends.It's just easier to txt ur friends,well to me it is since i always have my phone LOL<br>  <br>  But what is myspace really???I mean if JWs arent sapposed to have one them who are your friends??Most likely your classmates from school..and they already dont want us to associate with them more then we have to..<br>  <br>  Also i remeber i wouldnt  but some people add people that they dont know on myspace.Some people could be pretending to be a Jw so then u might talk to them..since they are a fellow bro/sis..What if that "JW" was an apostate??I would freak out!<br>  <br>  <br>  Its only for a safety.You can also look in The Young People Ask book volume 2..It has a chapter about online profiles.<br>  <br>  So remeber its not just myspace but facebool,Bebo,Hi5,any online website ment for chatting.<br>  <br>  Hope this somewhat helped!<br>  =)|`|j5YwuVEIaa	First of all...I am wondering if I am waisting my breath since you are so disrepectful of the elders who obviously just care for the cong and are passing along info from the faithful slave (who are inspired by holy spirit remember?) You need to build your faith. It sounds very much like you need to read some stroies in the bible that show you what happened to those who chose to do what THEY wanted to do. <br>  <br>  I am 36 years old and was also raised in the truth. I JUST had this conversation with my daughter. I put it to her this way. She has 2 very young sisters whom she babysit's on a regular basis. We live in the country and there is very little traffic on our street. I had asked her if she would ever let them play even out near the street? She said no. I said what would you say if they 'tested' you and went anyways? She said 'I would tell them to stay way back'. I asked her why she felt that way....it's not like there's alot of traffic? She said 'because I know how fast something can happen and a car could come out of nowhere'. So I said 'so what your telling me is that you make it a general rule not to play out by the street because you know the POSSIBLE DANGER right?' 'Yes' she said. <br>  <br>  I then explained that Jehovah uses the Faithful slave to guide us in life. We can take advantage of it or not. It is all up to us...yes even my daughter who is younger than 18. Choosing not to listen even in little things is saying 'You dont know what you are talking about Jehovah. I know all about this and nothing is going to happen.' I'll bet those that said that while taking a blood transfusion 30 years ago never imagined that it was so dangerous and led to AIDS huh? It is a protection for us and whether we know why or not is not for us to judge.<br>  <br>  I looked on her facebook before we had out talk. I noticed that you can see other peoples communication. Her cousin had some guy she was talking with who was into his horoscope and stuff. Do I really want my daughter reading that.....or 'playing even near the street?' No<br>  <br>  Satan is more powerful and sneaky than you think. Look at it this way....if the president told everyone to take some sort of action which seemed silly because he knew of terrorists that were going to do something I am fairly sure you would listen right? Why would you not do the same when the Creator of the Universe asks you? I have taught all 3 of my daughters the value of listening and explained that every time they do something really hard (like get off myspace) Jehovah sees and blesses them with a little more happiness or holy spirit. Even my teenager has experienced it. Believe me....I have seen every side of this road....disfellowshiped, weak and now strong..... I finally 'got it'. Listen and your life rocks...........dont and settle for ho hum.<br>  <br>  My challange to you..................<br>  Pray and ask to get your thinking in line with HIS will, try actually putting into practice the suggestions, and see how you feel. It's your choice....Every one in history made theirs and we know how it turned out for some (i.e. Lot's Wife).<br>  <br>  I know.............I'm long winded but hope you got the point. I will pray for you to..........you little fireball ;-)|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Haven't you noticed that anything that would be fun for a kid is against their religion in their cult?|`|WxlwpEDbaa	If I were you, I'd run.|`|wK85ZvOMaa	They can be annoying at times, but they only mean you good. Perhaps these elders don't know about Myspace's safety precautions, because all over the news they hear about kids getting abducted and such by others on myspace. You should give them a break, they only want to help.<br>  <br>  I am a witness with a myspace, and I know many others that have one. Once again it isn't ALL of them, perhaps it is just these certain elders banning it because of their perspectives on Myspace. Perhaps someone needs to teach them more about it?|`|dmTVbpcWaa	Quit Whining and get on with Life.There are More Serious issues at hand than your mind can Comprehend.

(Scientific proof, not mathematical proof) Because science can't prove a god exists, it's only natural to believe that it doesn't exist.

X1j7qYkUaa	that bisexuality doesn't exist...<br>  <br>  which I believe is rooted into the constructs of the predominate majority of society living with ideals of monogamy in relationships involving only one other person. <br>  <br>  And so, this belief is ultimately rooted to to the idea when a bisexual person is monogamously involved with only one person that their "status" as bisexual is removed, they have become exclusively heterosexual or homosexual and attractions are rendered moot.<br>  <br>  So this extends unto many stereotypes of what bisexuality is and how bisexual people are perceived...   though many stereotypes are like fables and myths - there are roots which have substance, though often  society's values and perception changes...culture progresses, regresses in the exchanging hands of generations, these stories grow into tales far beyond the imagination or the simplicity of what they were. <br>  <br>  But  there are always some stereotypes that become true through the experiences of others, whether or not they are aware of the lore gathered within their consciousness and history, which taints one experience with the validation to reflect on this shared lore to name all as one and all as true.  But of course, there are living stereotypes among every group, the few stereotypes are often the ones that manage to be seen the most as it often goes with every group, and eventually that is all people see, even when presented with an alternative.  Pop Rocks and carbonated beverages.<br>  <br>  So what's to say anything more than it takes knowing more than one, though that of itself is irrelevant as many of these stereotypes are also just hand me downs from another group that has joined the ranks.  <br>  <br>  What minority doesn't attempt to advance themselves by eventually slandering another minority, pushing their baggage and even their rage with the majority onto someone else... it's the games of culture and society as much as the way of our history and the human condition.|`|a5t1Ce9Aaa	I think society views bisexuals as indecisive, as in not being able to make up their minds on the basis of uncertainty, apprehension, or simply feeling confused.

9240749c186cc50485fb8fcbe650e163aa	In my opinion there are a multitude of reasons that can keep you from being all that you can be.<br>  It sucks but it happens, but the evil culprit is stereotypes and preconceived ideas/urban legends.<br>  For example some white people look too pink and white, and pity the person with a big bulbous nose, foreman thinks you are a drunk.<br>  I work in construction and the older males have to dye their<br>  hair because the foreman thinks that anyone with white/grey hair is too old, and slow to work. I also have a little bit of grey and I have experienced the discrimination. Preconceived ideas screw with everyone.<br>  If you are black they also discriminate because of preconceived ideas, the foreman thinks all blacks are too lazy to do hard labor because the ancestors worked hard labor and so the boss feels that he will not get a good worker only one who will cry racism, it is worse if you have a Latino foreman.<br>  If you are Latino they think you have just came over the border, "do you speak Spanish?"  Then they want to work you to the ground , the foreman thinks Latinos do not tire or can get injured, we are expendable like toilet paper.<br>  In terms of equality, I am realistic, I do not pity myself nor do I blame one race.<br>  It is a weakness of being a human, if we as humans have very little regard to our own environment only the here and now , how can we expect that we treat each other with dignity and respect.<br>  We have tried to legislate racism and discrimination but I realize it is a uphill battle, if humans were kind and respectful without legislation, if humans were naturally capable of this we would not need any type of rules, laws, or legislation to enforce against this terrible quality.<br>  <br>  It may sound like madness but the only way humans can be naturally good to each other if we became almost like all creatures, no primate qualities.(only Bonobos) We would not be able to know the difference.
IgNADy1Taa	1. People are going to get marihuana even if it stays illegal, and getting it from illegal dealers only increases the chances that it's of bad quality or mixed with things like sand so it weighs more and they can get more money for it. I can tell you for a fact where I live now in London the weed is of such worse quality than in The Netherlands where I'm from. There, weed sold in coffeeshops has to meet a certain standard of quality, so there are minimal health risks to smoking it.<br>  <br>  2. Since people now have to go out of their way to get it from illegal dealers, it increases the chances that they dabble in worse drugs since they are getting involved in underground dealing anyway. In The Netherlands the proportion of hard drug users is relatively low, and I'm sure one reason is that if you can easily walk into a shop and have a good time on weed, there's no reason to go out of your way trying to find hard drugs.<br>  <br>  3. Weed doesn't pose enough of a threat to your health to warrant criminalisation. Alcohol is legal, and so much more dangerous to your health - it's far more addictive (tons of alcoholics, yet never have I heard of a marihuana addict) and easy to overdose on (impossible to overdose on marihuana, the worst that can happen is you get real dizzy and nauseous). Moreovoer, alcohol abuse is responsible for a ridiculous amount of crime - alcohol makes you violent and uninhibited, making you more likely to assault or rape someone, or of course cause a road accident and accidentally take someone's life with drunk driving. Weed in contrast makes people chilled out and at the worst paranoid - it's not smart to drive on weed either but they did a road test in a BBC documentary called Should I Smoke Dope and the driver was driving insanely carefully because she was so paranoid and thought things were way closer than they were! Lastly, the long-term effects of alcohol have been proven for years (memory loss, intense liver damage) whereas with marihuana the scientific studies still have tentatitve conclusions about whether it contributes to schizophrenia or memory loss, and often contradict each other (a quick Google will show you this).|`|ExaerfDraa	Check out "The history of Marijuana" on youtube great series.

Ar233RMfaa	okay that sucks. but you still shouldn't have just walked away. if he likes you than he'll definitely still want to go out with you. you did the wrong thing by leaving. so i suggest you call him. maybe say something like "if it makes you feel better you can fart in my face" or something to sort of break the akwardness. but i guess now that you have farted (and right in his face, lmao), you have sped up the relationship. either it will be more akward between you, and that will eventually change, or it will be less akward. if he doesn't respond to your calls than he's a bad boyfriend so dump him. i was in a somewhat similar situation with my old girlfriend, but she never left. actually, we were making out and jumped in the back of her car and as we were going from the front seat to the back she kind of fell with her @ss on my face and farted a very smelly fart! but to make her feel better i farted in her face too and then we resumed making out (and i got more). maybe something like that will happen with you.|`|7utvegsmaa	Is his name Rip?

mVTGl6HGaa	The best available evidence to date indicates that four times as many females than males have direct experience of self-harm.[3] Caution is however needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may well engage in different forms of self-harm which may be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances.[12] The WHO/EURO Multicentre Study of Suicide, established in 1989 demonstrated that, for each age group, the female rate of self-injury exceeded that of the males, with the highest rate among females in the 13–24 age group and the highest rate among males in the 12–34 age group. However, this discrepancy has been known to vary significantly depending upon population and methodological criteria, consistent with wide-ranging uncertainties in gathering and interpreting data regarding rates of self-harm in general.[32] Such problems have sometimes been the focus of criticism in the context of broader psychosocial interpretation. For example, feminist author Barbara Brickman has speculated that reported gender differences in rates of self-harm are due to deliberate socially biased methodological and sampling errors, directly blaming medical discourse for pathologising the female.[33]<br>  <br>  This gender discrepancy is often distorted in specific populations where rates of self-injury are inordinately high, which may have implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender. A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self-injury among 428 homeless and runaway youth (age 16 to 19) with 72% of males and 66% of females reporting a past history of self-mutilation.[34]<br>  <br>  There does not appear to be a difference in motivation for self-harm in adolescent males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females.[6] One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting.[35] However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.[36]

Imagine that a teacher is telling his students how to solve a difficult problem. A clever but rebellious student claims that the teacher’s way of solving the problem is wrong. Implying that the teacher is not capable, this rebel insists that he knows a much better way to solve the problem. Some students think that he is right, and they also become rebellious. What should the teacher do? If he throws the rebels out of the class, what will be the effect on the other students? Will they not believe that their fellow student and those who joined him are right? All the other students in the class might lose respect for the teacher, thinking that he is afraid of being proved wrong. But suppose that the teacher allows the rebel to show the class how he would solve the problem.<br>  <br>  13 Jehovah has done something similar to what the teacher does. Remember that the rebels in Eden were not the only ones involved. Millions of angels were watching. (Job 38:7; Daniel 7:10) How Jehovah handled the rebellion would greatly affect all those angels and eventually all intelligent creation. So, what has Jehovah done? He has allowed Satan to show how he would rule mankind. God has also allowed humans to govern themselves under Satan’s guidance.<br>  <br>  14 The teacher in our illustration knows that the rebel and the students on his side are wrong. But he also knows that allowing them the opportunity to try to prove their point will benefit the whole class. When the rebels fail, all honest students will see that the teacher is the only one qualified to lead the class. They will understand why the teacher thereafter removes any rebels from the class. Similarly, Jehovah knows that all honesthearted humans and angels will benefit from seeing that Satan and his fellow rebels have failed and that humans cannot govern themselves. Like Jeremiah of old, they will learn this vital truth: “I well know, O?Jehovah, that to earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.”—Jeremiah 10:23.<br>  <br>  WHY SO LONG?<br>  <br>  15 Why, though, has Jehovah allowed suffering to go on for so long? And why does he not prevent bad things from happening? Well, consider two things that the teacher in our illustration would not do. First, he would not stop the rebel student from presenting his case. Second, the teacher would not help the rebel to make his case. Similarly, consider two things that Jehovah has determined not to do. First, he has not stopped Satan and those who side with him from trying to prove that they are right. Allowing time to pass has thus been necessary. In the thousands of years of human history, mankind has been able to try every form of self-rule, or human government. Mankind has made some advances in science and other fields, but injustice, poverty, crime, and war have grown ever worse. Human rule has now been shown to be a failure.<br>  <br>  16 Second, Jehovah has not helped Satan to rule this world. If God were to prevent horrible crimes, for instance, would he not, in effect, be supporting the case of the rebels? Would God not be making people think that perhaps humans can govern themselves without disastrous results? If Jehovah were to act in that way, he would become party to a lie. However, “it is impossible for God to lie.”—Hebrews 6:18.<br>  <br>  17 What, though, about all the harm that has been done during the long rebellion against God? We do well to remember that Jehovah is almighty. Therefore, he can and will undo the effects of mankind’s suffering. As we have already learned, the ruining of our planet will be undone by the turning of the earth into Paradise. The effects of sin will be removed through faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice, and the effects of death will be reversed by means of the resurrection. God will thus use Jesus “to break up the works of the Devil.” (1?John 3:8) Jehovah will bring all of this about at just the right time. We can be glad that he has not acted sooner, for his patience has given us the opportunity to learn the truth and to serve him. (2?Peter 3:9,?10) Meanwhile, God has been actively seeking sincere worshipers and helping them to endure any suffering that may come upon them in this troubled world.—John 4:23; 1?Corinthians 10:13.|`|NUiPUwcraa	Because God doesn't rule this world, this world is ruled by Satan.

And then I still came up with no acceptable answer as to why we, as the totally free human beings we were created to be, didn't stop that  Holocaust.  There was ample opportunity to even stop Hitler from gaining power, but WE didn't do anything to stop him or his cohorts.  And so, the same questions come to my mind when I remember the massacres by the Khmer Rouge over in Cambodia immediately following the Vietnam War, or the massacres over in Uganda and other african nations that they did to their own people, or the massacres that went on over in Iraq before the U.S. intervened to stop them, however successful or unsuccessful we may have been in the early war years.  Or  the massacres over in Bosnia-Serbia during that crisis.  God made US FREE AND POWERFUL, SO WHY DON'T WE STOP THE HOLOCAUSTS??

GItBUBL9aa	I feel some actual figures instead of hyperbole needs to be injected. Let's look at the inquisition numbers done by actual scholarship, not biased fiction. Below is taken from an article:<br>  <br>  "There were two major Inquisitions, the Medieval Inquisition and Spanish Inquisition. Although there are no exact numbers, scholars believe they have estimated Inquisition deaths reasonably accurately. There were not as many deaths as the popular press claims. Numbers have often been inflated to as high as 9 million by the popular press, with absolutely no scholarly research. This figure is completely erroneous. A broad range of scholars, many of whom were not Catholic, have carefully studied the Inquisitions. They looked at all the existing records and were able to extrapolate. . . . If we add the figures, we find that the entire Inquisition of 500 years, caused about 6,000 deaths. These atrocities are completely inexcusable. These numbers are however, a far cry from the those used in the popular press by people who are always looking to destroy the Church." <br>  <br>  <a href="http://askville.amazon.com/people-killed-Inquisition/AnswerViewer.do?requestId=3878676" rel="nofollow">http://askville.amazon.com/people-killed...</a>|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	When the sins of the Catholic Church are recited (as they so often are) the Inquisition figures prominently. People with no interest in European history know full well that it was led by brutal and fanatical churchmen who tortured, maimed, and killed those who dared question the authority of the Church. The word "Inquisition" is part of our modern vocabulary, describing both an institution and a period of time. Having one of your hearings referred to as an "Inquisition" is not a compliment for most senators.<br>  <br>  But in recent years the Inquisition has been subject to greater investigation. In preparation for the Jubilee in 2000, Pope John Paul II wanted to find out just what happened during the time of the Inquisition's (the institution's) existence. In 1998 the Vatican opened the archives of the Holy Office (the modern successor to the Inquisition) to a team of 30 scholars from around the world. Now at last the scholars have made their report, an 800-page tome that was unveiled at a press conference in Rome on Tuesday. Its most startling conclusion is that the Inquisition was not so bad after all. Torture was rare and only about 1 percent of those brought before the Spanish Inquisition were actually executed. As one headline read "Vatican Downsizes Inquisition."<br>  The amazed gasps and cynical sneers that have greeted this report are just further evidence of the lamentable gulf that exists between professional historians and the general public. The truth is that, although this report makes use of previously unavailable material, it merely echoes what numerous scholars have previously learned from other European archives. Among the best recent books on the subject are Edward Peters's Inquisition (1988) and Henry Kamen's The Spanish Inquisition (1997), but there are others. Simply put, historians have long known that the popular view of the Inquisition is a myth. So what is the truth?...<br>  <br>  Thomas F. Madden is professor and chair of the department of history at Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Missouri. He is the author most recently of Enrico Dandolo and the Rise of Venice and editor of the forthcoming Crusades: The Illustrated History.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Our chief weapon is fear and comfy chairs.

Throughout his dream when he was having a good life, there were 2 sets of footprints in the sand, one was his own and the other was God's walking alongside him.  He noticed throughout his life, when it seemed the lowest that there was only one set of footprints in the sand, therefore the man asked God, why did you leave me when I was at the lowest points in my life?

It's atheists. Not "athesits."<br>  <br>  Simple. You can't prove something isn't there. You don't believe unicorns exist, do you? Good. Now, prove to me they don't. You can't. I can't. No one can.<br>  <br>  So, how do we know unicorns don't exist? Because no one has yet be able to prove that they do. You see? We believe something doesn't exist when there is no proof that it does, not the other way around. That's why the burden of proof is on theists (not just christians).<br>  <br>  That's also why we're atheists. If you could prove god does exist, we wouldn't be. No one has ever been able to prove that he does exist, so we don't believe in him anymore than we do unicorns.

BULLSHI.T!|`|AA10696542	Oh hey look, its the guy who likes being on top of me!|`|Daosb3JWaa	We can't "prove" god isn't real, as has been said it's theoretically impossible to prove something doesn't exist. It's exactly this idea which gave rise to the Flying Spaghetti Monster and Russells celestial teapot. You can't prove they don't exist, but they're not very likely.<br>  <br>  We can, however, produce evidence to counter arguments for the existence of god. The greatest of these being the Genesis story. The Theory of Evolution completely debunks any notion that two humans, along with every other species on the planet, appeared suddenly approx  6-10K years ago. If there is no evidence for the involvement of god in this process, you can't use this as evidence of his existence.<br>  <br>  There is a natural explanation for everything in the universe. there is still a lot we don't know, but every time we find out something new, something previously attributed to "God", it turns out that no god was involved. At some stage we may find evidence of a supernatural being, but currently nothing has ever required one as part of the solution.<br>  <br>  FullArmourOfGod, Your presupposition is written down in the Bible. If you were capable of honest, objective inquiry, you'd realise this:. Although most scientists (and a higher percentage of your more highly educated people) are atheists, Most of the scientific community over the last several hundred years began researching a particular topic to find evidence of god, i.e. HOW God did something/caused something to happen. Many of them were working directly for the church, and were shunned/ridiculed or even threatened or punished when their conclusions turned out to be "A-Theistic"<br>  <br>  As has been said before, one piece of evidence proving God is all it would take. Sure we'll study it, try to poke holes in it, try to discredit it, but that's what scientific people do to ALL evidence, to see if it's any good. If your evidence stands up to this scrutiny, it'll change modern scientific thinking forever. <br>  <br>  That's why the burden of proof is on those making the positive claim. You say there is a God! Prove it!|`|S4XUl7qWaa	The basic principles of science dictate that it impossible to prove a negative. In every other possible aspect of life this is true, to why wouldn't it apply to deities as well?<br>  <br>  For example: prove that I don't see purple fairies in the clouds. Prove Mithra isn't true god. Prove there isn't a giant invisible teapot circling the sun.|`|AA11579058	Assuming that you are referring to the christian god... If god was real, he wouldn't allow there to be so many "false religions" gaining in followers and power every day.  His book (which is supposedly infallible) makes it clear that he is far too jealous and vengeful to allow that.|`|a6f5efb2cbade02a525b433574402dc8aa	Only if you prove that Odin isn't real. See the stupidity of that position. If everyone adopted your view we'd have to prove everything that the human imagination could dream up wasn't real. That it is why it is up to the proposer of the positive position to prove their claim.|`|FKN8Rmu6aa	Because it's the Christians and other delusional religious people who make claims that are unsubstantiated.Really, it is a waste of time trying to speak to mentally ill people, they just can't accept their condition. The religious person is a plague on society. They are holding back the progress of mankind. The modern thinking people of the world need to resist and fight them or our human race will be forever held back in the religious dark ages.|`|BLnXhWoTaa	you're going about it the wrong way, hon.  it's impossible to prove a negative.<br>  <br>  what atheists postulate isn't necessarily the non-existence of god, but the existence of a lifeless universe.  so you should ask them to prove that the universe is exactly the sum of its parts.  since they don't know all of the parts yet, they have no proof.|`|cF4fAj6jaa	Christians don't have a burden to prove God's existence. We are simply to live our lives as God fearing people, and abide by the law through faith. People will be able to see God's love through us. <br>  We're to share the word, not to convert people.<br>  <br>  Just live your life for God, don't worry about "proving" he exists.|`|355JLlcLaa	Why should there be a burden at all? If you believe in God, it isn't because you've proved He exists, it's because you have faith, maybe imprinted into you from a young age - though not necessarily.<br>  <br>  I realised in mid-teenage that faith was based upon nothing but itself, that science explained nature satisfactorily without needing supernatural beings, and that religious beliefs were no different to those of ancient beliefs in gods and goddesses. <br>  <br>  That was getting on for 40 years ago, and my escape from faith has freed me to embrace what science has to offer, which I consider far more plausible than belief in the supernatural, and is the nearest we can get to the truth about how nature and the universe work. I've felt a sense of freedom ever since.<br>  <br>  I still have an interest in religions, mythology and related matters, and am fascinated that people still believe in things that to me are just not true.<br>  <br>  Belief in a god probably goes back to times when people didn't understand how the seasons worked. And when winter came and the crops no longer grew, some sort of sacrifice would have been made to the sun, and then it came back and the crops grew. The people would have associated the sacrifice with the positive outcome, and they wouldn't have dared not do it again because they couldn't risk famine.<br>  <br>  In time the sacrifice will have become more sophisticated, and perhaps the idea came about that the sun might be the gift of a god rather than the god itself. This might be a way, or similar to a way, that religion developed. <br>  <br>  People would then have assumed that the laws that their ancestors devised came from the god, so the religion would have become even more sophisticated still, providing authority for the laws and fear of a vengeful god if laws were disobeyed, and the same fear would make others stone to death anyone who breached a law to avoid vengeance being visited on the whole community. <br>  <br>  There are probably other elements, but it will have gone back to the dawn of civilisation.<br>  <br>  The idea of the biblical God changes throughout the course of the Bible as does the name, and there seem to be several changes of Deity. For example, when Moses encounters God, God introduces himself as Yahweh (I am who am, I will be what I will be, etc), which is a different name to that used at the beginning of Genesis, Elohim, a plural of El a Canaanite (Phoenician) deity; continuity with previous beliefs is maintained by claiming to be the God of Abraham, Jacob (Israel) and Isaac. In fact the first Creation myth in Genesis probably derives from the Babylonian Creation Epic, Enuma Elish in which the Creator God's name is Marduk, probably via the Canaanites.|`|Hvq4IWrZaa	Who's asking you to prove he is?<br>  <br>  When someone says they don't believe in God, Christians automatically try to prove there is one, you bring it on yourself, you start the arguments.<br>  <br>  If someone points at a green fence and says "That's a red fence" you don't HAVE to argue.|`|d4ab69OKaa	Because some things just can't be disproved.

A christian ladie came to the place i was working and we just started talking and she heard my storie, and gave me her bible. she said she could get another. i started reading the bible, and getting my family into it.i have become EXTREMLY religious, i even do work with the preachers, yet im only 16. and some how i have never been more happy in my life since i found god and started praying, and started going to large pray groups. i have noticed a huge improvment in my life. my mother is soooo much better now. and my fathers cancer is almost dead. he is even working construction again. we are all fire fighters. my dad was the fire chief untill he got the cancer, now he is the chief again. and some prayer help out when we are in a burning building that could colaps and kill us all at anytime. The moral of my storie is that, God has made a GIANT impact for the good in my life.<br>  <br>  <br>  You should try reading the bible. and give god a try. start opening your heart up to him, and he will grab it quickly. and you will feel more joy than you have ever felt. you will also feel protected. and like you can accoplish ANYTHING, you will be a better person, and stop caring all about your self. and care more for others. and do anything in your power to help a friend or neighbore. its a great feeling it really is.<br>  <br>  And if the whole evolution thing, and dinosaurs has you unconvinced, Read "Job 40:41" it talks about Dinosaurs.|`|BPO6roTOaa	Well, there's not really a specific "non-religion" I believe in.

I was stuck in islam from fear, I didn't want to be Christian because there wasn't a good christian influence in the world, bt when it all comes down to it, the only person that truley speak for christianity is Jesus Christ and when you finall y open your eyes to see that there is a completely different plan for us. You will not only get out of God, Christ and the Bible eternal salvation, but a darn good mythical story in revalations!<br>  <br>  ps - i know yo dont think it but its your soul that brought you to ask this question.|`|q6cHuTf1aa	Christianity.<br>  Why? Well you see, mostly it's because thats what i was taught growing up. But also because it makes sense, when you REALLY think about and understand the nature of GOD. Atheism makes no sense because its pretty much saying "there is no such thing as god" and not "there may possibly be a god, but i don't believe in him." Agnosticism WOULD make sense, save for Pascal's Wager:<br>  If you believe in God, and he is real, when you die, you go to heaven.<br>  If  not, nothing happens.<br>  If you DON'T believe in God and he is real, you go to hell.<br>  If not, nothing happens.<br>  In one case you either go to heaven, or nowhere, so it's impossible to lose.<br>  In the other case, you either go to hell, or nowhere. So it's a 50% chance you just may get screwed for eternity.<br>  <br>  But anyway, back to Christianity. The Christian God is all powerful all mighty so on and so forth. So saying that you would have an understanding of the way he thinks is stupid. All you can go by is the Bible really. So who's to say that he didn't create the world, and set it up so that the evidence would point towards the Big Bang Theory and Evolution, in order to test the faith of humans? He allows the Devil to tempt people, so why not?<br>  <br>  So in effect, it's pretty much impossible to flatout deny the existence of an omnipotent deity and then go on to consider yourself intelligent. Unless you are, of course, not. Honestly no one really KNOWS, there is only a belief. Even the Pope acts on FAITH. So you can't really say that there IS either. You can only say that you BELIEVE. And I believe that Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior, and maybe you should meet him.|`|9mrjbqJaaa	I believe in God but not religion.

ptIIkqq0aa	I am glad that you are proud of your Catholic beliefs, however I am afraid you have been mislead about your very own religion. <br>  Catholics, in no way or form worship saints, Mary, or anyone else, ONLY God. <br>  Have you ever asked someone important, like your mother, to pray for you? That is exactly what the Catholic Faith means by 'praying' to say saints. You aren't asking (or at least you shouldn't be!!) asking a saint to 'grant your wishes';  what you can do is called intercession, where you can ask say Mary to pray FOR YOU to God. <br>  Kneeling can be used as a form of reverence, not worshiping. So many people are mislead by this assumption, and they still insist that they know more about the Catholic Faith than us Catholics do.<br>  You are not required to 'pray to' saints-God is the only one your are praying to, all you are doing is asking someone to pray to God for you , and I cannot emphasize that enough!<br>  <br>  I strongly encourage that you read the Catechism of the Catholic Faith, or visit some trusted Catholic sites. Or better yet, ask the Priest your questions. I'm glad that you are seeking answers for beliefs that are confusing you.<br>  <br>  Pray to God to find the answers you are looking for. <br>  <br>  If you have any other questions, please feel free to e-mail me!|`|um9W8Dy8aa	Saints are prayer partners <br>  and we should get many prayer partners among mortals living now, but even more so among those who are around the throne of God<br>  <br>  That's part of being the Body of Christ<br>  <br>  All Catholic prayer goes to the Father through the Son,Jesus Incarnate Eternal Word and the One Mediator, in the Holy Spirit<br>  <br>  God bless<br>  <br>  God bless|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Why do Catholics insist on Kneeling and worshiping saints?<br>  <br>  They think of it much the same as you asking someone to pray for you - except that they believe that the saints are more effective "prayer partners" than Joe Christian.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) The bible says that only through Jesus god will hel p you.<br>  <br>  Where?<br>  <br>  <br>  3) what do you mean I dont sound catholic?<br>  <br>  Well, it's understandable someone would get that impression.  It's because<br>  a) you question official doctrine<br>  b) you refer to Scripture in a manner that suggests that Scripture trumps church doctrine<br>  <br>  Don't be annoyed that someone thought you Protestant.  I thought so too (and I AM Protestant).<br>  <br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...</a>|`|0fnzDpKXaa	If you're really a Catholic, you'll know that you're not supposed to worship saints.<br>  <br>  You don't sound like a Catholic to me, everything you've written misrepresents Catholicism and reeks of fundie.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  You don't sound Catholic because Catholics aren't taught to worship anyone other than God/Christ.  Who's telling you to worship saints?|`|h5q89E3Haa	Why we pray to the saints.<br>  <br>  Rev 8:4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand. <br>  <br>  as for the Blessed Mother of God.<br>  <br>  Luke 1:48 For he has looked upon his handmaid's lowliness; behold, from now on will all ages call me blessed. <br>  <br>  I hope you further your knowledge in the Church, it is wonderful and all of what the Church does is in the bible. <br>  <br>  So you should never doubt why we do something, it is biblical, just ask.<br>  <br>  My profile allows contact if you have any questions email me.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	Sorry if i offend you but you do not sound like any Catholic i've ever heard and i'm Catholic. Every Catholic on here knows we do not Worship any saint including our Blessed Mother. Every Catholic i know can tell you asking the saints to pray for you is a personal decision encouraged by the Church but not a commandment of the Church. If your Catholic in which i seriously do not believe you are your a very ignorant one. Only the Mother of Jesus now your in danger of heresy.So yes you can pray directly to GOD but the reason we have Saints are they are with GOD in Heaven serving GOD and aiding us.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Because we have been doing this since before we wrote the bible. We know we are on solid ground with our Lord in heaven. Which branch of the Catholic Church do you belong to?|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Ditto to Kevin S. That's the impression I get but its ok; off and on I appreciate good rabble rousing. As an analogy, last row I read, an avatar of an Afro American came on and ran down his own race and culture praising the whites.<br>  <br>  That said, I don't kneel and worship people who I ask to pray "for" me, neither have I ever asked a saint.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|kvzP96v4aa	Catholics do not "worship" saints.<br>  <br>  You either assume incorrectly or you have been misguided.  Seek clarification from a priest or catholic scholar.<br>  <br>  All my best to you on your spiritual journey.|`|HjPxEupWaa	How many times do we have to say We Do Not Worship Mary? <br>  <br>  I think a significantly large number of Protestants don't even know the history of their own faiths. Much less the true origins of Christianity.<br>  <br>  If GOD came through her to us, then why can't we go through her to Him? <br>  Rosalind Moss...|`|F0UF9DDeaa	We do not worship saints we worship GOD and JESUS. We pray for the Saints in Heaven to help us through the struggles that we have that they specialize in. If you need protecting you pray to Saint Christopher to protect and he delievers the prayers to Jesus. As far as the kneeling.... You are to kneel and humble your self for Christ. Note the scripture below...<br>  Romans 14 :11For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.<br>  <br>  Also, remember that a lot of it is heritage and the old way; meaning the most respectable was do things.<br>  <br>  For all of those comments I have read. MARY th blessed Mother did not die before us... She ascended into heaven. Read!!!<br>  <br>  Some times priest are not that concerned. That was not a proper way to handle it. I tell you what I will do, my brother - in - law is a priest email me and I will let you know his answers in regarding this. <br>  <br>   I find that prayer this way helps me get results quicker, but that does not everyones answer. There is nothing wrong with praying straight to GOD!!!!|`|nF7g8nphaa	When we deliver prayers to the Saints we are asking them to bring our prayers to god.<br>  The individual saints represent specific areas of need or causes of martyrdom. If, for example, you have an unexplained seizure or an experience that is labeled as a "mental illness" then you might pray to St. Dymphna, Patron for mental and nervous disorders including epilepsy and ask that your prayer, together with the prayers of all others who seek the aid of St. Dymphna, be brought to God and answered as is God's will.  <br>  <br>  Asking a Saint to intercede in the delivery of your prayer to God is not so very  different than requesting that all members of your congregation pray for a person who is ill in the hospital.

5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	God hasn't given up on you - not at all. His love never changes, and He loves you just as much today as He did when you first gave your life to Jesus. As the Bible says, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever" (Hebrews 13:8).<br>  <br>  Why has this happened to you? In my experience, this usually happens for two reasons. First, it happens because we rely on our feelings instead of on facts - the facts of what Christ has done for us. Feelings and emotions aren't wrong; God gave them to us, and they are an important part of our lives. Feelings, however, come and go; we don't always feel on top of the world.<br>  <br>  But facts - unlike our feelings - don't change, and we need to rely on them instead of our feelings. And the greatest fact of all is that Jesus Christ died for you, because He loves you and wants you to be with Him in heaven forever. The Bible says, "How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are!" (1 John 3:1).<br>  <br>  The second reason God seems distant is because we neglect the spiritual "food" He has provided to strengthen us - the "food" of the Bible, prayer, and fellowship with other believers. Just as we'll grow weak physically if we neglect to eat, so we'll grow weak spiritually if we neglect these. Make them part of your life every day, for through them you'll grow closer to Christ.|`|c6mG9bIiaa	God will not give up on you. He works in mysterious ways.

AA11213217	*IMPORTANT: Stuff in parenthesis are optional/automatically inferred, and if you say them, it looks like you're repeating yourself...most of the time*<br>  <br>  "Hello my name is..."<br>     -Hajimemashite, (watashi no namae wa) ... desu<br>     -Ohaiyou gozaimasu, (watashi no namae wa) ... desu<br>     -Ohaiyou, (watashi no namae wa) ... desu<br>     -Konichi wa, (watashi no namae wa) ... desu<br>     -Konban wa, (watashi no namae wa) ... desu<br>  <br>  *note* The first one is what you would use when indtroducing yourself for the very first time. The next two are in polite-ness order, meaning that "Ohaiyou gozaimasu, (watashi no namae wa) ... desu" is more polite than "Ohaiyou gozaimasu, (watashi no namae wa) ... desu". Also, just so you know, the ones that begin with "Ohaiyou" should be used in the morning time. The one that begins with "Konichi wa" should be used in the afternoon, while the one that begins with "Konban wa" should be used in the evening.<br>  <br>  "What is your name?"<br>     -Anata no (namae wa nan desu ka)<br>     -Kimi no (namae wa nan desu ka)<br>     -Anata wa...? <br>     -Kimi wa...?<br>  <br>  *note* The first two are again in polite-ness level from more polite to less polite. The last two should be used if continuing the conversation after sharing your name.<br>  <br>  "Awesome!"<br>     -Subarashi! (meaning wonderful)<br>     -Suteki! (meaning awesome)<br>     -Kakkoi (meaning cool, not temperature)<br>  <br>  "What are you doing?"<br>     -Anata wa nani (wo) shimasu ka<br>     -Anata wa nani (wo) shite imasu ka <br>     -Kimi wa nani (wo) shimasu ka<br>     -Kimi wa nani (wo) shite imasu ka<br>  <br>  *note* Here, those that start with "Anata" are more polite, while those that start with "Kimi" are less polite. It is important for you to know that those ending "...(wo) shite imasu ka" are a better "direct" way of asking what are they doing at that very moment. Those that end in "...(wo) shimasu ka" seem to say "what will you do" or "what do you do" because Japanese doesn't have a way to clearly identify future tense. Moreover, here, it doesn't matter wheather or not you include the "wo" in the parenthesis.

The Torah is given as a book of law (and much more of course) for the Jewish people to follow. It includes in it a total of 613 commandments which all Jews are required to perform. Nevertheless a non-Jew is exempt...<br>  <br>  A non-Jew is however required to fulfill "one" particular teaching of the Torah. This is the fact that there are 7 commandments that were given to the entire world to fulfill, known as the Sheva Mitzvot Bnei Noach, or in English, the 7 commandments to the children of Noah. Since ultimately everybody in the world is a direct descendant of Noah who survived the flood thousands of years ago - all non-Jews must observe the basic laws that bring peace into the world.<br>  <br>  The laws include:<br>  <br>  1. Belief in One G-d i.e. Do not worship idols (this includes *any* religion which relates to their god as anything less than the One Omnipotent G-d who fills all space and encompasses everything. This includes a prohibition of any pluralism in G-d completely.)<br>  <br>  2. Not to blaspheme His Name<br>  <br>  3. Do not murder i.e. Giving respect to human life<br>  <br>  4.

0341a5f4a7f0251c27ed7bf8a89a6c6daa	Why do most people go to church on Sunday there are about 13 reasons but they are NOT supported by the Bible.<br>  <br>  I will explain each of the 13 reasons below it may be a little long, but it will cover all the reasons. I do not want to offend anyone with what I say but I have to say what the Bible says.<br>  <br>  <br>  The 13 reasons<br>  <br>  1.The early church changed<br>  NO WHERE in the Bible does the early church say “The new day of worship is Sunday” There is NO verse in the Bible to support this.<br>  <br>  The early church kept the Sabbath <br>  The apostles kept the Sabbath<br>  Acts 13:14<br>  Acts 13:42<br>  Acts 13:44<br>  Acts 16:13<br>  Acts 17:2<br>  Acts 18:4 <br>  <br>  the Gentiles went to Church on Sabbath<br>  Acts 13:42<br>  Acts 17:1-4<br>  Acts 18<br>  <br>  <br>  2.Sunday is the new Sabbath because of the resurrection<br>  No verse in the Bible says worship on Sunday due to the Resurrection. God said that Baptism is symbol of the death and resurrection of Christ<br>  Colossians 2:12<br>  Romans 6:3-4<br>  Galatians 3:27<br>  <br>  <br>  3.Jesus fulfilled the law so the Sabbath is gone<br>  Matt 5:17<br>  "Do NOT THINK that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I HAVE NOT come to abolish them but to fulfill them.<br>  <br>  does fulfill mean do away with or end<br>  <br>  "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to do away with them.<br>  Isn’t that the contradictory?<br>  <br>  <br>  4.We can’t tell which day<br>  So, ENTIRE Jewish Nation all over the ENTIRE world woke up one morning and EVERY one of them forgot which day was the Sabbath?<br>  That is not logical<br>  <br>  The change of the calendar had no effect on the weekly cycle<br>  The US Naval Observatory and the Royal Observatory both confirm the 7th day Sabbath(Saturday) is the SAME Sabbath that Jesus kept.<br>  <br>  Mark 16 says that Jesus rose the day after the Sabbath. We all know Jesus rose on Sunday... so what day is the Sabbath?<br>  Some people say “God didn’t name the days Sunday, Monday, Tuesday etc so we don’t have to keep it.”<br>  Essentially what these people are saying is because we speak a different language from the Jews we don’t have to do what God says<br>  <br>  <br>  5.It does not matter which day WE choose<br>  God did not say "Pick a day to worship" He said "THE" 7th day is "THE" Sabbath. The word "THE" means a specific item.<br>  <br>  The first person to say "It doesn't matter how we worship God" is Cain. Cain said "It doesn't matter how we worship God as long as we give something God will accept it. God does not care as long as you give and call it holy. Don't be legalistic Abel." <br>  Was he right?<br>  Is God specific about what He says.<br>  <br>  <br>  6.It was only for the Jews, or The Jewish Sabbath is Saturday and the Christian Sabbath is Sunday<br>  The Sabbath was given to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden 1000 yrs before the first JEW was born Genesis 2:1-3 if they were Jews we all are Jews and STILL need to keep the Sabbath<br>  <br>  There is NO SUCH THING as "The Jewish Sabbath and the Christian Sabbath". There is ONLY ONE Sabbath day regardless of religion, race, nationality or language. The 7th day Sabbath does not belong to the Jews it belongs to God, "I am Lord of the Sabbath" Jesus said. In addition "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord" Exodus 20:8-11<br>  <br>  <br>  7.Sunday has always been the Sabbath<br>  This contradicts the Mark 16 which says Jesus rose the day after the Sabbath on the first day of the week.<br>  <br>  8.we are under the new covenant<br>  Hebrews 8:7-12 says<br>  For if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant, no place would have been sought for another.(What was the problem?) But God found fault with the PEOPLE and said "The time is coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a nEW COVENANT with the house of ISRAEL and with the house of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt (Why?), because THEY DID NOT REMAIN FAITHFUL TO MY COVENANT, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord. This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. <br>  <br>  The Old Covenant- the people failed to keep their part “They said we will do it” Exodus 19:8 and they failed<br>  <br>  The problem with the Old covenant was the people failed to keep it. There was nothing wrong with the law.<br>  <br>  The Old Covenant was based on the people, God says “If you will...then I will” Exodus 19:5<br>  <br>  The New Covenant is based on God, God says “I will and I will”<br>  <br>  Where does God say that He is changing some of the laws? Where does God say that He is doing away with the Sabbath?<br>  <br>  The New covenant, same law <br>  <br>  Yahoo won't let me post the entire 13 reasons but you can find them here<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArD7gZIQjisVnlLkZJCTv.vty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080326230121AAko1z8&show=7#profile-info-mJ2iyCLkaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|aWHvHIr1aa	You sound as if you know when the first Sabbath was and that it has continued to be that way since Moses.  On what basis do you make this assumption as nothing will support this position?  <br>  <br>  You use of the words Sunday and Sabbath indicate you are feel free to mix the Gentile calendar with the Jewish calendar.  I say that because the Sabbath is from sundown to sundown and Sunday is from midnight to midnight.  <br>  <br>  The Jewish calendar is based on the 4 phases of the moon being 28 days.  As every educated person will tell you, it is not an exact 28 days.  To compensate for this, the Jewish calendar adds an extra month on some years to keep it from snowing on Passover.  <br>  <br>  The Passover is on the 14th day.  Here is the dilemma:<br>  <br>  1.  You can either believe that the Jews compensated to observe Passover on the 14th day of a month with 28 days.  <br>  <br>  2.  You can believe that Jews were not Torah observant and observed Passover any day of the month.  <br>  <br>  Your choice but there is no third option available.<br>  <br>  Passover in 2008 was observed at sundown on Saturday, April 19.  <a href="http://www.when-is.com/passover-2008.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.when-is.com/passover-2008.asp</a><br>  <br>  2009:   April 9-16    starts on Wednesday night<br>  2010:   March 30-April 6   starts on Monday night<br>  2011:   April 19-26  starts on Monday night<br>  2012:   April 7-14  start on Friday night<br>  2013:   March 26-April 2  starts on Monday night<br>  2014:   April 15-22  starts on Sunday night<br>  2015:   April 4-11 starts on Friday night<br>  <br>  Note: The Jewish calendar date begins at sundown of the night beforehand. Thus all holiday observances – including the first seder – begin the night before the dates listed. Jewish calendar dates also conclude at nightfall.<br>  <br>  Passover website:  <a href="http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/671901/jewish/When-is-Passover-in-2009-2010-2011-2012-2013-2014-and-2015.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/...</a><br>  <br>  Calendar website:<br>  <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/index.html?year=2015&country=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/inde...</a><br>  <br>  Passover is observed on different days of the month now so the Sabbath can remain on the same day of the month of the Gentile calendar.  If Passover stayed on the 14th each year of a 28 day month like the Jewish calendar, then there would be a problem of the Sabbath staying on the same day on the Gentile calendar.<br>  <br>  When there is no Gentile calendar to measure against, the Jewish calendar doesn't have a problem of celebrating the Passover on the 14th day of the 1st month and observing the Sabbath.  The Jewish calendar made compensations in order to adjust to putting the month in right part of the year or the day on the 14th day of a 28 day month.<br>  <br>  So if you fast forward to this year and tried to translate the Sabbath from the Jewish calendar to the Gentile calendar...you can't.<br>  <br>  And if you followed the Jewish calendar, all days of the Gentile calendar week have been the Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Col 2:***16Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration <br>  <br>  or a Sabbath day. <br>  <br>  17These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ. 18Do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize. Such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen, and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions. 19He has lost connection with the Head, from whom the whole body, supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews, grows as God causes it to grow. <br>  <br>   20Since you died with Christ to the basic principles of this world, why, as though you still belonged to it, do you submit to its rules: 21"Do not handle! Do not taste! Do not touch!"? 22These are all destined to perish with use, because they are based on human commands and teachings. 23Such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom, with their self-imposed worship, their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body, but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence.***  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col%202;&version=31;" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?sea...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|XSh0u9Kwaa	Nimrod and Baal (Babylon) sun worship.<br>  <br>  Gen 10:10  And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.<br>  <br>  2 Ki 23:5  And he did away with the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the surrounding area of Jerusalem, also those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun and to the moon and to the constellations and to all the host of heaven.<br>  <br>  Jer 8:2  "And they will spread them out to the sun, the moon, and to all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and which they have served, and which they have gone after, and which they have sought, and which they have worshiped.

Regarding the quote he makes in Colosians I feel it needs to be given some type of interpretation, since it could appear to express an opposite meaning to it's intended purpose.<br>  <br>  Col 2:***16Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration <br>  <br>  The writer here is warning those individuals not to let anyone judge him or her on these matters, because the writer is expecting these individuals who he is addressing, to obey these festivals or the eating of certain foods or blessings of the new moons or sabbaths so on and so forth, by this verse it is made clear that the writer is addressing not gentiles but Jews.<br>  <br>  So the admonishment is for the purpose of helping the individuals to obey to follow and to fulfill G-d's laws so that no one would have a judgment against them. If they do not obey what would happen? A judgment would be entered against the person[s]. So the writer here was warning us against the possibilities of this occurring.<br>  <br>  The authority {who is G-d} wants us to worship him in spirit {his word is spirit} and in truth { and the Moshiach is the truth} equally is his word. So if G-d has established the 7th day to rest and worship him their in, why do gentiles rest on the 1st day and call it the L-rd's day? I think this is what should really be answered.<br>  <br>  And if I may I can deliver this answer to you and that is, because they have changed what is truth {G-d's word} for that which is untrue {their own warped interpretation}.<br>  <br>  EDIT---***A pagan city no doubt in which Jews resided in. It cannot be addressed to non-jews for the simple reason that he himself {Paul} did not encourage gentiles to carry a heavier burden then what they should be carrying, since it was he who once said reffering to non-jews that they should only practice from obstaining towards food that have been sacrificed to idols, eating blood or animals who have been strangled, etc etc. It is understood that he was alluding here to some of the Noachide laws.<br>  <br>  This is only one aspect of the story, the other flip side is, that only Jews are known to keep the Passover and only required of [them] to do so. Only Jews are known for blessing the new moons and keeping of festivals and sabbaths and having distinctive dietery laws. So why address Jews in this manner in a pagan city one may ask? <br>  <br>  Because those Jews who are returning to G-d thru the Messiah whom Paul is a witness too, needs to make it clear to them {as a witness to us} that a Jew does not seece from obeying the laws of G-d, and wanted to transmit the message that those Jews who have accepted the Moshiach and do not follow G-d's commandments are teaching people {non believing Jews & gentiles alike} that the Messiah Yeshua is leading Jews away from G-d and the life he intended for us Jews to follow, and those Jews or teachers who teach the opposite of this are doing just that, going opposite to the truth.<br>  <br>  So Paul is not reffering here to pagans who have come to beleive in the Messiah, but he is infact reffering to those Jews who are believing in Yeshua the Messiah thru his message.<br>  <br>  2nd-EDIT*** It is interesting how you reject the Noachide laws as truth when they are clearly written down for everyone with an interest of learning can see. These laws {and I am not going to insist in answering your blogs anymore, this is just an exception, since this is the type of question that brought contention upon us in the first place.} <br>  <br>  As I was saying, these laws are clearly visible for everyone to see, it is not obscured from view like your rejection to them  are. <br>  <br>  Don't forget that with your rejection I can demonstrate it's validity,  but I am not going too. You want  the throne? Don't worry, you can have it, I never meant for you to understand that I wanted it in the first place.<br>  <br>  I am clearly aware that you have chosen your own path to what is called truth & holiness, just as the man called Korach who led people to his kind of truth. <br>  <br>  But atleast he was swallowed up by the earth instintly, you on the other hand will lead people to a lie as long as you are able too. I'm sure that it is done unintentionally but ignorance in this matter is a sin.<br>  <br>  You are only fulfilling an aspect of G-d's prophecy that was spoken of by his emmeseries saying: that I will bring upon them a lying spirit so that they will believe the lie instead of the truth. So may all those who follow your teaching accept you and your doctrine. And may all those who follow the L-rd follow me towards him.|`|7Y82gO5Faa	This is a great question and "Conundrum" gave a fantastic answer. I am a Seventh-Day Adventist who is happy to answer this with Biblical truth and not veiled misinterpretations and false ideas. Hopefully between the two of us, you will see many perspectives regarding the Sabbath that you haven't thought of before. I will add to his thoughts in many wyas and have some big things to say to your other answerers so, people keep reading. <br>  There is NO authority to change the Sabbath day from Saturday to Sunday that can be found in the Bible anywhere. God commands men to work on Sunday. Not suggest it, this is a command! “Six days you SHALL labor and do ALL your work but the Seventh is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God. In it you shall do no work.” Exodus 20:9-10 “...the six WORKING days, but on the Sabbath it shall be opened.” Ezekiel 46:1 Now, I know that some of you are saying, that is for the Jews and a covenant between them and God. Well, Let's go to Jesus who preached to ALL mankind and seek an answer. "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to FULFILL. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, (meaning ALL time and ALL humanity, not just the Jews), not one jot or one tittle shall in know way pass from the Holy Law, till all be fulfilled.” Matthew 5:18 “If you love me, keep MY COMMANDMENTS” John 14:15 Not the Jewish Commandments, not the antiquated Commandments. My Commandments. “He that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth Me; and he that loveth Me shall be loved by my father and I will love him and will manifest myself unto him.” John 14:21 There is is twice, if we love Jesus we should keep the Commandments, can only Jews love Jesus? No. "Blessed are they that DO His Commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city." Rev. 22:14. Now we see that we will be blessed to keep them and have entrance to heaven as well! Don't you want to see Jesus face to face? Then keep the Commandments! <br>  Why? Well because not keeping them is sinning,   "Sin is the transgression of the law" 1 John 3:4 "All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God" Romans 3:23 So then, according to the Bible, if there was no law, there would be no sin, correct? Read this text. "And where there is no law there is no transgression" Romans 4:15 Wow! So you can see, if we eliminate the Holy Law of God, then essentially we are saying that there is no such thing as wrongdoing. "What, then, was the purpose of the law? It was added because of transgressions" Galatians 3:19 Very interesting... So with no Law – no sin. But we know that there unequivocally is sin in the world right? And we also know that sin separates us from God right? So, Jesus says if you love Me and want to have a relationship with Me, than stop sinning because that is separating us. Stop breaking the law (or sinning.)  It is most simple.<br>  So who changed it from Saturday to Sunday? The Roman Catholic Church did and I can prove this. Read theses quotes from Catholic theologians. This may shock some of you but look it up and you will see that I am telling the truth here. These are all valid quotes and you can find every one plus many more on-line. <br>  “Sunday is a Catholic institution, and its claims to observance can be defended ONLY on Catholic principles. From beginning to end of Scripture there is not ONE SINGLE PASSAGE that warrants ANY transfer of weekly public worship from the last day of the week, Saturday, to the first day, Sunday.” Catholic Press, Sydney Australia<br>  <br>  “Protestants accept Sunday rather than Saturday as the day for public worship after the Roman Catholic Church made the change. But the Protestant mind does not seem to realize that in ACCEPTING the BIBLE, in observance of Sunday, they are accepting the authority of the spokesmen for the church, the Pope.” 'Our Sunday Visitor' (A Catholic magazine.)<br>  <br>  “If Protestants would follow the Bible, they should worship God on the Seventh Day Sabbath day. In keeping Sunday, they are following a law of the Catholic Church.” Albert Smith – Chancellor of the Archdiocese of Baltimore in a reply to a Vatican Cardinal.<br>  <br>  “Reason and common sense demand the acceptance of one or the other of these alternatives; Either Protestantism and the keeping holy of the Sabbath day, or the Catholicity and the keeping of Sunday. COMPROMISE IS IMPOSSIBLE.” 'The Catholic Mirror'<br>  <br>  “Of course the Catholic Church claims that the change of solemnity from Saturday to Sunday was COMPLETELY her act, and the act is A Mark of her ecclesiastical power.” Cardinal Gibbons and Chancellor H.F. Thomas.<br>  <br>  Now a conversation straight out of “The Catholic Mirror.” from the editor mind you!<br>  <br>  “In the Old Testament reference is made 126 times to the Sabbath, and ALL of these texts conspire harmoniously in voicing the will of GOD COMMANDING the SEVENTH DAY to be kept, because God HIMSELF first kept it, making it OBLIGATORY on ALL as a 'Perpetual Covenant.' Nor can we imagine any one foolhardy enough to question the identity of Saturday as the Sabbath or Seventh Day, seeing that the people of Israel have been keeping Saturday since BEFORE the giving of the Law, a period of well over three thousand years!... Examining the New testament form COVER to COVER, critically we find the Sabbath referred to 61 times. We find too that the Savior INVARIABLY selected the SEVENTH-DAY SABBATH to teach in the synagogues and work miracles. The 4 gospels refer to the Sabbath 51 times...The Redeemer refers to himself as 'The Lord of the Sabbath' and NEVER ONCE hinted at ANY desire to change it. Thus the Sabbath is Saturday from Genesis to Revelation!...Hence the conclusion is inevitable. Those who desire to follow the Holy Bible as their guide, the Israelites and Seventh-Day Adventists have EXCLUSIVE BIBLICAL weight on their side whilst the BIBLICAL PROTESTANT HAS NOT ONE WORD IN SELF-DEFENSE FOR HIS SUBSTITUTION OF SUNDAY FOR SATURDAY!...whilst the Pharisees of old kept the True Sabbath our (Catholic) modern Pharisees have NEVER once in their lives kept the true Sabbath which their master kept to His dying day, death and which His apostles kept after His example for 30 years afterwards, according to records...the Bible and the Sabbath constitute the watchword of Protestantism; But we have demonstrated that the Bible is EMPHATICALLY AGAINST their (Sunday) Sabbath...We have shown that NO GREATER CONTRADICTION EVER EXISTED IN THEIR THEORY OR PRACTICES!! We have proved that neither their Biblical ancestors nor themselves have ever kept but ONE Sabbath day in their lives...(NOTE THIS) the catholic Church for over 1,000 years before the existence of a Protestant, by virtue of he divine mission CHANGED the day from SATURDAY to SUNDAY...The Protestant world at its birth found the Sunday Sabbath too deeply ENTRENCHED to run counter to its existence...The Israelites and Seventh-Day Adventists are witnesses of this weekly desecration of the DAY REPEATEDLY NAMED BY GOD ..The history of the world cannot not present a more stupid, self-stultifying specimen of DERELICTION of PRINCIPLES than this...That immense concourse of Bible Christians, The Methodists have declared that the Sabbath has NEVER been abrogated, whilst the followers of the Church of England together with her daughter, the Episcopal Church of the US are committed by the 20th article of religion that the church CAN NOT LAWFULLY ORDAIN ANYTHING CONTRARY TO GOD”S WRITTEN WORLD' YET!!! GOD”S WRITTEN WORD CONSISTENTLY enjoins His worship to be observed on Saturday, ABSOLUTELY, REPEATEDLY, and most EMPHATICALLY!!! ALL Biblical scholars occupy the same position which NO explanation can modify, much less justify. They have ignored and CONDEMNED their teacher, THE HOLY BIBLE, and they have adopted a day kept by the Catholic Church, or 'The Mother of Abominations' (really spoken)...Their response for leaving the bosom of the Catholic Church was APOSTASY from the TRUTH AS TAUGHT IN THE WRITTEN WORD. They adopted the Written Word as their SOLE teacher which they had NO SOONER DONE than THEY ABANDONED IT, as these articles have ABUNDATLY proven.” End quotation. Remember now, that was from the pen of an EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGABLE and RESPECTED CATHOLIC THEOLOGIAN. Shocking isn't it? <br>  So that tells us why it was changed. This was done back in the Dark Ages and hasn't been changed since. But the Bible never says to do so. Jesus kept the Sabbath and we are to follow His example. “And he came to Nazareth...and as His custom was He went into the synagogue ON THE SABBATH DAY.” Now Matthew 12:8,, “The Son of Man is even Lord of the Sabbath.” Now read Hebrews 13:8 “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and FOREVER AMEN!” He never changes. Why should it change? The Sabbath is a memorial of Creation and God is still the Creator regardless of what Darwin says. We all are created by God so we all should observe that memorial. “And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that IN it he had rested from all his work which God created and made." The day is special. (We rest IN the Sabbath.) Read my other answers on the Sabbath to be even more amazed. I could say so much more, but I will run our of room! ... (I will continue under "Your Friend" Please keep reading)|`|F9603tQ0aa	(continuing now...) <br>  Now briefly let me address DSM's remark. Friend please read this. My friend who said all of that about the Jewish calendar. That is rather remarkable! You clearly have a grip on their means of measuring time, but what you said had absolutely NO relevance to the Seventh Day Sabbath and I will prove this! You mostly talked about the Passover: well, this question isn't about the Passover - it is about the weekly Sabbath that was instituted in Eden. But continue reading. Ponder this...<br>  How do we measure a day?     By one revolution of the earth on its axis.<br>  How do we measure a month?     By the cycle of the moon around the earth one time.<br>  How do we measure a year?     By the earth's cycle around the sun one time.<br>  How do we measure a seven day week? ... Why is it seven days? ... Did you know that of ALL the measurements of time throughout the ages, ALL have been changed at one point or another in various calendars and other systems of measurement except one. THE WEEK HAS ALWAYS BEEN SEVEN DAYS IN EVERY CALENDAR AND SYSTEM OF TIME MEASUREMENT IN ALL OF EARTH"S HISTORY. And it is only an arbitrary selection of God so that the Sabbath cycle would NEVER be lost in history. Don't think this is just coincidence. So, even if the calendars were different, as they apparently were, the seven day week would still be the same therefore the Seventh Day would still come on a routine cycle. That is the ONLY cycle of time measurement that has never changed in world history! Wow! So, the Sabbath still was observed on the Seventh Day because God said so. “The Seventh Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God?” Not the Sabbath of the Jews, the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, ... our God as well.<br>  Now let's look at your Scriptures. Col 2:16 Paul says “Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days” Woo! kill the motor! Look at the closely, “Sabbath dayS” , PLURAL. Wait, the Sabbath of God is ONE day. Paul is speaking of the CEREMONIAL LAW. Read Leviticus 23 for a complete understanding of these dayS. This is referring to the YEARLY Sabbath and feast dayS that pointed to Christ's coming. Once He came they have no further meaning which is why Paul is saying to not observe them in Colossians 2. <br>  Paul kept the Law. “I worship the God of my fathers believing ALL things which are written in the Law and in the prophets.”Acts 24:14 That included the Sabbath and never once is there a record of him routinely observing any other day “Then Paul went in as his CUSTOM was and for three SABBATHS reasoned with them from the Scriptures.” Acts 17”2-3 “Neither against the law of the Jews, nor of the temple nor against Caesar, have I offended ANYTHING at all.” Acts 25:8 How could this be true is he was breaking the Sabbath? It couldn't be.<br>  <br>  And lastly, we do know when the first Sabbath was. There is proof. Read on. “And on the Seventh day God ended all His work which He had done and He rested on the Seventh Day from all His work that HE had done. Then God blessed the Seventh day and SANCTIFIED it because IN it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.” Genesis 2:2-3 Before any Jew - before any religion. The Sabbath was and still is.<br>  If this was a good answer and if you got what you were looking for, could you PLEASE give me the best answer? I would so much appreciate that! It has taken me an hour and a half to write this. I really wanted to submit it so that I could show “DSM” his errors from the Bible even if you might not have learned from my remark. If you do decide to give me best answer, PLEASE, PLEASE give it to “Lover of Knowledge”!!  This account, “Your Friend” is from the same person as “Lover of Knowledge” and only exists so I can write longer answers when necessary. I don't care if this gets best answers but PLEASE give it to “Lover of Knowledge” as I ("Lover of Knowledge") am sincerely trying to become a Sabbath-believing Top Contributor in R&S and need best answers to do so. We need that. So PLEASE do NOT give “Your Friend” the best answer if you do decide to give it to me (L.o.K.,) which I very much hope you might!

Like porn, it has the potential to be awful (she dipped her rosy lips betwist her lover's dripping thighs...you get the idea) but I like the fact that it focuses not just on whats (this is the sex act that is happening) but whys (how the characters feel about the sex).|`|5f568984c834bb49358fc78371558d20aa	Yes, I do.

CmLDcfMfaa	Catholic’s are more into manmade tradition.  For example no disrespect but the rosemary comes from a pagan faith.  The bible says we are not to repeat our prayers over and over.  We do share the same God, one God, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  But Catholics keep doing for their salvation, and Christ said on the cross it is done.  The blood of Christ has cleansed us from all sin.  There are numerous verses why we believe we are saved through faith and not of ourselves.  One is Ephesians 2:8&9.<br>  We pray to God through His Son, we don’t pray through Mary or Saints.  John 14:6 Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life no one will come unto the Father except through me.  Also other verses where it says Jesus is our mediator. <br>  <br>  Also a person to read about is Martin Luther who started the Lutheran church.  It was the book of Romans that made him realize that we are saved through faith and not works.  <br>  <br>  There are a lot of things that are different between Christians and Catholics.  But just calling ourselves a Christian or Catholic doesn’t save us from our sins.  You need to repent and receive Jesus Christ as your own personal savior.  John 3:16 John 1:2.   <br>  <br>  I see no harm visiting your friend’s church I use to go to mass with my best friend when I was younger.  Each of us, [wherever we choose to go to church] must continue to grow in our own faith.  God says we are to study and show ourselves approved.  Part of growing in the spirit is to study the bible both Christian and Catholic a like.  Even if Christians cannot agree on doctrine, we agree who God is, and that He sent His Son to die for our sins, that makes us brothers and sisters in Christ.  John 1:12 When we receive Jesus we become the children of God. <br>  <br>  When Jesus said He is coming back for His bride, (the church) he wasn’t talking about the building, the believer in Christ is the bride (the church) he is referring to.  Remember in the Old Testament they had to go to the temple to worship God, now our body is the temple and the Holy Spirit indwells us.  We are still not to forsake ourselves upon assembly, so where ever you choose to attend church, check the bible to see if what you are being told is so or not that is what they did in the New Testament.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	Same god, same jesus, different brainwashing methods.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	They do communion at infrequent times not every time.

I am very serious about this. I want you to drive to your local equivalent of a Walmart. You don't even have to get out of the car. Park. People watch for one hour. Do not come back here and tell me you didn't see dozens and dozens of less-than-beautiful people who were all there with a date or a spouse. There are people for every type of person. It doesn't matter what "level" you think you are on, there will be people who are most happy to meet your acquaintance, date you, have sex with you, fall in love with you and marry you and then procreate. The only time there are snags is when someone of a certain physical level fixates on hooking up with a person of a much greater perceived physical beauty. This doesn't mean it can't work; sometimes it does. But it just means that's where it becomes more challenging.<br>  Don't believe me still? Get out one of you parents' old high school yearbooks. Pick out what you believe are the 20 ugliest people in there. Ask you parents one by one if those people ever dated in school. (They did.) Ask you parents one by one if those people ever got married. (They did, and sometimes to each other, but not always.) You have to make up your mind that the person who has the biggest obstacle with your looks is usually YOU. Take your new-found good attitude and positive outlook out there and get dating. There is someone out there thinking the same thing you are and just waiting to be asked out on a date. I am sure of it.
stAeoUeSaa	Thule|`|NR3YnkVPaa	That other guy has an interesting bit of info but doesn't answer the simple question.

The whole world that Odyesseus lives in is like Mt. Zion, but he so wants to believe that he is living this alternate life that his perceptions become real to him.  That's the Matrix part of the story.  Odyesseus believe Circes to be the real, when in reality he is living in Troy (Mt. Zion).  If you just remeber that fact, watch The Matrix and think of the following matrix characters as characters from the Odyssey, you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Neo-Odyesseus (obviously)<br>  Trinity- Penelope<br>  Morfious-Athena<br>  King of Mt Zion-Zeus<br>  Agents-Suitors<br>  Agent Smith-Telemelchus (Odyesseus' son)<br>  <br>  I love when movie makers decide to remake classics.

I came out two years later, and have found that many straight men will be accepting if they are truly your friend. A good majority of my friends are straight men, and none of them gave two shits. And, many of them were homophobic prior to finding out about me, and now if anyone were to ever **** with me about my sexuality( which nobody does, being that I live in a pretty liberal area), they would for sure have my back. It is however, much easier to tell girls first ( ones that don't have big mouths). Also, it really depends on how open your family is. If you feel as if your parents are not going to react well, wait until after college/ or whenever your moving out of the house. And make sure you have a good group of friends around, just in case. I told my parents earlier this year, and they really didn't care at all. Ohh ,a dn way to go 12 year olds making the same joke. I wouldn't know bro, I'm not gay. You're clever. Do the world a favor, and don't use computers until your balls have dropped, and you're old enough to realize that using the word bro makes you sound like a complete tool.|`|VVwVhnmQaa	My first crush on a guy was when I was about five years old. He was so beautiful; stray blonde hair, shimmering green eyes. Yet growing up, I never knew there was a term for it (homosexual, gay, etc.) 'Course now I do. Then I came out to my friend in seventh grade, and I was about thirteen years old. Soon enough the whole school found out, and I gain many new enemies. I lost countless friends and was verbally abuse and sometimes physically. (Guys would run from behind me, slap my head, and run away. Terrible, I know.) I think it was that same year that I told my mother, then my grandmother. They were both very accepting. Shoot, my mom was still very young and hittin' the clubs, she knew many gay people. And my grandmother said she always knew lol. Finally I got to high school and am surrounded by many friends that, not only accept me for who I am, but find it completely natural. And so far in my family, my mother, father, both grandmothers, little bro. and sis., uncle, and cousin know. They all accept me. I was very surprised that my grandfather accepted me because he's the reason why my second gay uncle divided himself from the family. Now I've learned that my grandfather regrets kicked him out of the family, and my uncle is living somewhere in Orlando with his life-long black (my grandfather's also racist) partner, and working as a hair stylist in Disney lol|`|tmbxpbZ7aa	Alright, first off- some of the answers before me are really immature, and seriously if you guys want that much attention than atleast make us laugh.<br>  <br>  In answer to your question, I'd have to agree, I was very young.  I'm bi, so you might count my vote in half (see? Funny.).  But really, it took till I was 22, and it was Horrible telling my mom.  It wasn't until a few weeks ago actually that I got it out of her that it would be okay for me to bring a girl home.

FISPBJbNaa	i know this stuff<br>  <br>  <br>  St. Patrick biography <br>  St. Patrick is called the patron saint of Ireland. His real name is Maewyn Succat but changed it to Patricius after he became a priest. In his own autobiography Patrick said he was born in Bannavem Taburniae on the west coast of Roman Britain in the year 387. Patrick was said to be born in a family with high roman rank and they were related to the patron saint of Gaul. Patrick’s mother worked in an office in Britain and his father was a deacon, a civil official, as well as a town councillor. When Patrick turned sixteen he was kidnapped and was sold into slavery in Ireland for six years when he escaped because in his dream, God told him he could escape by going to the coast to find a passage aboard a ship, Patrick did this and returned to Britain. Patrick changed a lot throughout those six years, he even decided that he wanted to spend his life serving god. Eventually, Patrick put himself under the guidance of St. Germain, who was the Bishop of Auxerre. St. Germain told Patrick that he should become a priest, and do missionary work. In the year 432 Patrick was sent to Ireland as a bishop. Despite everything bad that happened to Patrick in Ireland he went and started a thirty year project of converting the Irish people to Christianity and today 93% of people in Ireland are Christian. Patrick died in 466 on March 17th , but was not forgotten because of all the amazing things he did for Ireland, and because of all the people that he helped change their life. Patrick is also remembered from people all around the world now because on March 17th is now called St. Patrick’s day and is celebrated to remember St. Patrick.<br>  <br>  please help me with my question if you know.|`|AS2EiJFDaa	only thing i know to suppose to wear green<br>  that day or pinch me

And that God died on the cross for our sins. <br>  <br>  Know your religion...Jesus was the one that died on the cross<br>  <br>  This big bang is fake. Explosions don't create life.

Being a good person doesn't get you to heaven unless you accept him into your life. There has to be a boundary that says, you go to heaven or you go to hell. God doesn't say things like, you've been good for most of your life so you go to heaven.<br>  We don't just worship and accept God to get to heaven, but we also do it because God created us and he deserves to be worship. If you want to be a born again Christian you can say this prayer. " Lord God please forgive me for all the bad things that I've done and please come into my life. Amen."<br>  <br>  Thats the biggest load of crap Ive ever heard.  If god doesn't accept you for being a good person, but because you say a stupid little prayer, then pastors are liars.

When i believe and put my faith and trust in Jesus i will spend eternity in heaven because my sins were taken care of on the cross no other way.

Which again if your not a Christian probably doesn't make sense. I suggest doing a little research for yourself and finding it out. It's good to question and just listen to what your heart tells you.

Then in Genesis Chapter 12 God  makes a covenant with Abraham and Thu his seed come the Nation of Israel and God deals with them until they kill their king and they fall. Genesis Chapter 12 to Acts Chapter 9. In Acts Chapter 9 God calls the apostle Paul and send him to preach the gospel of the grace of God to all people and reveals to him the mysteries that have been hid in God before the foundation of the world. Roman Thu Philemon are the books written by Paul to the body of Christ (the church) when God deals with the church.<br>  Hebrews Thru Revelation deals with doctrine after the church has been taken off the earth. So if you rightly divide the Word of truth there are no contradiction in the Bible. 2 Timothy 2: 7 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. 2 Timothy 2: 15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.|`|AA10382821	The 'contradictions' are a result of the unlearned attempting to make sense of something they know nothing about.|`|AA11613218	I look at all of them you listed and..........|`|98cf507aa80271fa8ebdb192d7ca2b8faa	Because like everone else there are a lot of lazy christians who have never read the bible.<br>  <br>  In fact there was a good 1000 years or so when no one was allowed to read the bible except the clergy.|`|AA10474496	Name one, but first look at the context, and then I'll answer your question.|`|AA10798322	What "endless contradictions" are you talking about?

Apocalyptic literature were writings talking about current events and the immediate future using things like symbolism and fantastic imagery. <br>  <br>  These used to be quite common back in the day when it was first written.  The problem is that people today don't get it.  The Book of Revelation is talking about what was happening to Christians in the 1st century A.D. under the Romans.  It is not a book about the distant future.  It is not a book referring to anyone from the 21st century or later.

The word means, simply, telling one thing from another.  When you prefer to eat food and to avoid eating poison, you're discriminating.  Discrimination is an evolutionary adaptation that humans (and other animals) apply to each other and to their surroundings on an almost continual basis. Life would be impossible to sustain without discrimination.<br>  <br>  Before the leftists started warping our language with their new political definitions for its words, discrimination was almost universally hailed as a good thing.  A discriminating person had a refined taste and elevated moral principles.  But then leftists did to that word what they also did to "gay."<br>  <br>  Of course, what the leftists really don't want you doing is practicing racial discrimination. They insist that we all believe that the races are equal in character, intelligence and behavior - even though they are not. <br>  <br>  For example, leftists want White parents not to act sensibly and proactively in defense of their children by sending them to mostly White schools. They want those parents to do what amounts to feeding their children poison, by sending them to schools with lots of vicious minority students, where they'll be at greater risk of being stabbed, shot, raped, and beaten up.<br>  <br>  Discrimination, racial or any other kind, is a good thing.

Especially if you're old enough to be in high school (I'm guessing that's where your Spanish education began).<br>  <br>  I don't know the context, so I'll leave it there, but it's generally pretty rude to correct an instructor in front of their class in the first place.  Corrections should be saved for after class, and the teacher can take the opportunity to correct him/herself the next day.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	It implied that she was wrong because she couldn't be verified with a reference source.

I didn't do it to be rude, but rather to be helpful.  She seemed to get annoyed after a while, so then I stopped doing it, but then she told me (kind of jokingly) that I "wasn't paying attention" when I ignored one of her mistakes.  Then I started teaching German and when students pointed out my mistakes, I was always thankful for it, as long as they did it in a helpful way.  If they sighed, shook there heads, rolled their eyes, etc., THAT was when I got annoyed.<br>  <br>  But yes, not all words are in the dictionary, especially if it's a small one.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

You cannot be held to the conditions of a covenant you are not a party to.|`|Yslq4OYhaa	The Sabbath is a delight. <br>  <br>  It is a day of worship. I don't celebrate the day, but I do celebrate the Lord Jesus Christ whom is Lord of the Sabbath. <br>  <br>  It begins Friday at sun down and ends Saturday at sun down.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  In Genesis God rested from all of his work on the 7th day and He blessed the day. In Exodus God wrote with own finger the 10 commandments. The 4th command says remember the Sabbath Day and keep it holy. Six days shall thou labor and do all of thy work, The 7th day is the Sabbath. <br>  <br>  God sanctified(set it apart) this day from all other days. He said this days is a sign between him and those that keep <br>  his covenant.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is a difference in the Sabbath and a Sabbath. A Sabbath are the Sabbaths that are a Holy Convocation (high days or feast days).<br>  <br>  Since Christ is the perfect man and we are supposed to follow the example the He gave us why wouldn't you keep the Sabbath. It was Jesus custom to enter into the synagogue on the Sabbath and teach the scriptures.<br>  <br>  So many have been mislead and worship another Jesus (sun god) on his day Sunday. Hmmmm?<br>  <br>  I am so glad that we are not ignorant to satans devices(tricks).|`|RgceFQ9Caa	The Sabbath (Friday sunset to Saturday sunset) is a time of rest, relaxation and refreshment from our labors the other 6 days of the week.   It is not something that should be kept in a ritualistic or leagalistic manner.   There should be some Bible Study, prayer, family time, family meals, etc.  In our own case we spend part of the Sabbath just catching up with what is going on in each other's live since we work different scheduled throughout the week.  We avoid the tendency of many to make  a long list of do's and don'ts for the Sabbath, that is what Christ took the Pharases to task for.  However we do avoid work or excessively talking about work (believe me it is a relief not to have to think about what goes on in our workplaces one day a week).<br>  <br>  The main focus on the day is to build our relationship with our Almighty Father and His Son as well as those with our family and brethren.|`|AA11856921	Isa 58:13  If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, honorable; and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: <br>  Isa 58:14  Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

BqXIltLqaa	Your more comfortable with girls so it does seem you are a lesbian.|`|KBBonf97aa	It's normal and common for teenage girls to experience same-sex attractions that have nothing to do with what will ultimately become your sexual orientation.  It has to do with elevated hormone levels, which have caused girls to question their sexuality since the beginning of time.<br>  <br>  Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships, but most girls who do this are straight.  Some are doing it because it's considered cool and others don't realize that same-sex attractions are normal during adolescence, but usually temporary.  That's why there are so many teenagers who identify as bisexual, but very few who don't identify as straight or gay by the time they're in their 20s or older.  If you attend your 10-year class reunion, you'll find that virtually all of the girls who considered themselves bisexual as teens grew up to be happily heterosexual.  And the hipness of bisexuality actually makes life harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't something they can wear for a while and discard when it's no longer in fashion.  Very often they're used by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity or test their own boundaries without the risk of being gay.<br>  <br>  A lot of people will tell you to experiment with both guys and girls and then decide your orientation, but that will probably confuse you more.  Any person can enjoy physical stimulation from another person, male or female, and it has nothing to do with sexual orientation.  A gay man doesn't turn bisexual or straight if he has sex with a woman any more than a lesbian becomes bisexual or straight from sleeping with a man.  The acts are just acts and anyone can do them and enjoy them.  But sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  Nobody gets to "decide" what it is, no matter how fashionable a particular orientation may be.  And sexual orientation often doesn't make itself clear until late adolescence or early adulthood.  That's why most teens who think they're bisexual realize later that they were wrong.<br>  <br>  Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she was attracted to other girls.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she came to a very wrong conclusion when she was a confused kid fighting an epic battle with teenage hormones.  And she's the first to admit she never would have declared herself bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.<br>  <br>  If you've always liked guys and the attraction to girls started during adolescence, chances are you're completely straight and you're just going through normal hormonal turmoil.  The good thing about sexual orientation is that it always sorts itself out over time.  Just be patient and let nature do the work for you.  In a few years, you'll know exactly who you were meant to be.|`|U5A8JQ1paa	i think you're a lesbian|`|1e90efeeb79c6b4e8fa4f2e5ef94aad5aa	Honey obviously you are a lesbian. if you don't feel comfortable with men do not date them.|`|KIEmtvsYaa	Omg, I went throu the same!<br>  If your still an adolencent, you probably won't know for sure untill an adult.

HxXduL1maa	The Korean War erupted on June 25, 1950 in the middle of the burgeoning Cold War, an international struggle between the US and the USSR for world domination of their competing ideologies, Democracy/Capitalism versus Communism. While the Soviet Union never got directly involved in the fighting, it did supply North Korea with weapons and supplies. The US, on the other hand, did commit its own troops as part of a UN international-peace keeping force.; the troops were made up of almost entirely American forces, with some American allies. <br>  <br>  The Korean War was the first instance that it became clear that the UN could be used by the US as a foreign policy tool. <br>  <br>  The Korean War  represented an important shift in US Cold War policy. By 1950, a loss to communism anywhere was thought of as a loss everywhere.. The US got involved in Korea to save face and to appear strong against communism, not because Korea was vital to American interests. Somewhat ironically, South Korea was only a sham democracy under Syngman Rhee, who was really just as tyrannical as North Korea's Kim Il-Sung. <br>  <br>  One of the significant results of the Korean War was that it gave the US reason to increase its military expenditure four-fold. Under Truman, military expenditure increased rapidly, laying the foundations for the so-called military industrial complex that existed throughout the Cold War The Korean War also strengthened the US relationship with Britain, which sent troops for the UN peacekeeping force <br>   <br>  Another result of the Korean War was the ascendance of the People's Republic of China onto the world stage. Fighting against the US, China received aid from the Soviets, helping them to become a major military power. The US had proved the fulcrum in both World War One and World War Two, with its forces providing the force needed for its European allies to overcome its enemies. The Chinese forces, however, fought the US to a standstill, as represented by the reinstitution of the 38th parallel as the dividing line between North and South; in fighting against the US in the first war the United States entered and did not win, China established itself as a power to be reckoned with, and a communist power at that. <br>   <br>  The Korean War also proved the tenacity and skill of the Communist Asian militaries, something that would be reaffirmed by the Vietnam War in the 1960s. In fact, remarkable similarities exist between the Korean War and the Vietnam War; from the US support of a dictatorial and corrupt anti-communist regime to its conception of communism as a monolithic entity, under which all communist nations were necessarily allies, rather than individuals to be dealt with separately. However, though those parallels, Vietnam era policy-makers did not apply the lessons of the Korean War to the Vietnam War. Rather, they did not seem to recognize those lessons as lessons at all, and repeated in the Vietnam War many of their previous mistakes. <br>   <br>  The Korean War also showed the impact a single individual can have on history. General MacArthur's brilliant strategies, willfulness, egomania, and refusal to obey orders dramatically influenced the outcome of the war, in both positive and negative ways. <br>   <br>  Finally, the Korean War demonstrated the new terms of the new post-WWII era, and showed how difficult it would be to fight a limited war under those terms. Although the United States attempted to keep the war on a very small scale, it quickly snowballed out of proportion, involving China, at times seeming as if it might become a World War III. Looked at another way, though, the Korean War can be considered a success: although the war did at times get out of hand, the US and the USSR were able to avoid direct confrontation, especially since the USSR fought mainly by proxy. Perhaps most importantly of all, though it was fought just five years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed, the Korean War was not an atomic war, avoiding both the possibility of immediate nuclear holocaust (since the USSR by then had its won bombs) and setting a pattern that would continue throughout the Cold War.
AA11608181	Lent is a time for Catholics to prepare themselves spiritually for the Passion (the Last Supper, crucifixion, and Resurrection) of Christ.  Catholics don't eat meat on Fridays during Lent in commemoration of Good Friday, the day on which Jesus was killed.  Meat is seen as a luxury, and abstaining from it is a way Catholics have of reminding themselves of the solemnity of the event.  How can a Catholic feast and sit in luxury on the day that their Lord and Savior was executed?|`|VgC9QNNTaa	As a Sacrifice....<br>  <br>  =)|`|debcb4d2389a40e3a2418f989c48ceccaa	To sacrifice something for the Lord which is weird because Jesus was supposed to be the last sarifice.|`|ptw6kNiCaa	It's a way of wearing badges in public to separate the European Catholics from the rest of the world.  <br>  <br>  Adolf Hitler used badges also to distinguish one group from another group.

He is not African-American, he is French-American...or European-American if anything...so to call him African-American is just a lie, so that is why he is Black.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	From now on I demand to be referred to as an "Estrogen American" or a "Womyn."|`|zRPXczxAaa	I certainly hope you're wrong that it's offensive for me as a white person to call a dark-skinned person-of-color "black."  "White" is what I am, and "black" is the only word I have to call him.  We can't use the once-polite "n*gro," (Yahoo! Answers will turn it into unspeakable asterisks if I fully spell it out), and I point-blank, utterly refuse to use the monkey-with-a-top-hat-grandiloquent, absurdly affected, erroneous, and way too long "African-American."  If I can't call him "black," we may have to give up on talking entirely.|`|TNTFomKeaa	That's an interesting question. I'm from the UK and it's normal to say "black" here. To me it's just an adjective describing physical appearance, just as I might say someone is blond or brunette. <br>  I guess there's just a lot more racial sensitivities in the US as a result of slavery and then everything up to and including the civil rights movement. That said though, white people seem to be referred to more and more as Caucasian, so you never know!<br>  "African American" actually strikes me as a funny thing to say about someone you don't know. That person might be any nationality and just on vacation in the US!|`|AA11352641	I don't think it is. I say "black." <br>  <br>  There are some people who are overly sensitive to stuff like that and are quick to call it racist or un-PC. To me, political correctness as far as race relations go, is very divisive. It causes more of a divide than it bridges. A better way to look at it is, there's black and white and it's ok if we're different because we're still humans. Getting too caught up in the sensitivity of it clouds the fact that COLOR DOES NOT MATTER.|`|EHrbDq0naa	People have a right to be called whatever they want, but I agree with Sarah from the UK in that the oddest of all things to call a black person is African American. I've never understood that and if I wanted to, as a citizen of the US, I could resent it. And, honestly, maybe I do just a little.  I'm Scottish and Cherokee Indian. What I do call myself?|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	Black is descriptive and can be used as such.  If it is meant in a demeaning way, it is offensive.|`|66tTuuIFaa	Actually most consider African American to be more offensive consider we don't call white people European Americans. Many people who have immigrated here from African don't wish to be referred to as black but rather as a Kenyan, Somalian, Ethiopian, etc. (whichever country they hail from)<br>  <br>  Really it's all up to personal preference. As with all people, opinions and feelings vary depending on geographical location, education, and socio-economic class. Some don't wish to be referred to as black, some don't wish to be referred to as African American, some just don't care either way.|`|12YwFUB1aa	Hummm I don't think it is offensive for a white person to call African Americans "black".  Maybe your situation is just dealing with people with sensitive personalities.  <br>  <br>  I am black and if a white, Asian, Latino came up to me and called me black or American American, i wouldn't think twice about it nor care. Trust me there are a lot other names that are much worst.  These names are totally subitable in my opinion.|`|BCuIcYRqaa	When has it ever been offensive?<br>  I don't know any black people that don't like being called black besides Africans<br>  Many of them refer to themselves as whatever country they are from, whether it be Kenyan or Somalian, etc.<br>  But majority of blacks in USA have been away from Africa for centuries<br>  So i doubt many would be offended<br>  <br>  Now in my opinion i believe that it is nothing wrong with Saying black or African American because i consider myself both of these<br>  <br>  White people should not be offended about anyone calling them white, simply because they are the ones that made up these terms of race to call people anyway|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	It's not offensive to call black people black. Some people are just hyper about political correctness and they don't even realize that African-American is a misnomer for most of the black people in America. (For example: President Obama is African-American because his father is Nigerian. I am black because my parents, grandparents, geat-grandparents are from America. We have no information about our African heritage. What country? Which language? What culture? It was too long ago; nobody knows now. So it's a little silly to call myself African based solely on my appearance.)|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	I don't agree.

Just because you fall in love with someone doesn't mean you will love them forever, it's sad but true.  <br>  The people still in love with their ex's obviously haven't accepted the break up, I couldn't get over my ex until I accepted the fact that it was over between us.|`|eGvyFeW9aa	Er.

SDDgbtQ4aa	I agree that it sounds more like a common case of sleep paralysis.|`|JMOLRKRraa	First he should go see a doctor and get a check up. There is definitely a physical symptom.<br>  I generally think being choked is a demonic attack, and can happen while you are awake also. I generally call Jesus and have spirit removed.<br>  But being held down can also be linked to astral travel which you do sleep time, being held down is not being in your body yet. The link is in the pituatary gland in the head, the astral body to physical body cord is linked to shoulder area, according to reports .<br>  <br>  I think he should consciously decide to limit any astral travel until he gets his health in order. The main carotoid artery in the neck is vital, maybe there is blockage.<br>  he could get a sleep test and rule out apnea and heart conditions, if he has insurance.|`|He5XWnJtaa	That's a classic example of sleep paralysis. It has nothing to do with anything supernatural. During sleep paralysis episodes, almost everyone engages in some kind of hypnagogic hallucinations.<br>  <br>  Visiting a doctor like you're suggesting is a good idea, because it's very likely he is experiencing sleep apnea, and even if that has nothing to do with the sleep paralysis hallucination, most people do suffer from apnea to some degree anyway.

I know this is pretty stupid, but they don't know much about the importance of saying prayers.     But how to solve this problem is talk to your principal (this works for other schools, and my school as well) or a Muslim teacher. You can establish a club for Muslims, so they can pray together.    Again, to answer your question, they may not pray on time, but as soon as possible, they can go home and make up these prayers.|`|XTUg4Uk8aa	they don't it doesn't matter they do it later on when classes allow.they come to the west and learn to fit in and not worry about such matters|`|UpIjgNV5aa	Well most kids and adults don't pray. Rest offer the prayers as Kaza, so Fajr can be too early and when Zuhar and Asr in school. So they offer it with Isha.     Education is also a vital part of Islam and it is also Fard. Education and knowledge is also the greatest forms of Ibadah. Kids must excel and have thirst for knowledge. Allah(SWT) shall no doubt rewards people who have thirst for knowledge and spend their time seeking knowledge.     Allah(SWT) in over 750 verses compel us to seek, learn, think, contemplate!   Prophet(PBUH) said, "seek knowledge even if you have to go to China".|`|bZo5Z53Uaa	Kids are not required to pray if they have not reached puberty or shown sings of maturity.

Other than that if the pupils want to pray they present a note to the teachers and asking them to give them time out so they can go pray.|`|K5nwQfnjaa	We can't! :(    Teachers don't let us and I am the only Muslim at my school!|`|MhbEQoJYaa	Well most of them are in private schools but the ones that are in public schools could write a note and give it to the principal. from there the principal may allow you to pray in an empty room or the sick bay.|`|9QhnQNFyaa	both above answers are great|`|NiWX109paa	Well most of them are in private schools but the ones that are in public schools could write a note and give it to the principal. from there the principal may allow you to pray in an empty room or the sick bay.

Z3E2zKPWaa	Im not sure what your question is but... No one knows for sure where Aztlan is, since at first, the Aztecs were wanderers and came from the North.

Show your sources please, I haven't heard that yet..I heard of Mexico City going underwater, but not that..<br>  <br>  But the concept of Aztlan to the Chicano movement, is not an actual place. I think it's more of a state of mind. Being proud of being a Mexican. Also taking into account, that the western United States use to be Mexico. I guess it's one of those things like Aztlan (your homeland) is where you make it.<br>  <br>  And I don't think that even Mexicans would be in support of Mexico being split into three different countries.

YomAtJn3aa	I know exactly the type you're talking about - I've worked with a few. Most of them frankly just like to complain.

The truth is inside they know they've got a good job (or at least don't want to leave just yet for other reasons), they just complain outwardly.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	I've often wondered the same thing...and I've come to the conclusion that for some people "the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know."    A person may hate their job, but enjoy the camaraderie of coworkers.     They may find the work itself boring, but they're comfortable with the routine and are afraid of taking risks.    They may have on "golden handcuffs"....the pay and benefits are too good to walk away from.    They may be figuring they made their bed now they gotta lie in it?  Example:  a person goes to school to be a lawyer, spends thousands of dollars on education, discovers they HATE being a lawyer but yet they feel it's too late to change careers...and what would others think? especially his family and peers?       then add the fact that so many people have lives that are mortgaged to the hilt.  The sheer weight of their debt load almost guarantees they have to stay on the jobs they hate...and they fear losing that job and plunging even deeper into debt.    Just a few reasons there...|`|jfDggfMCaa	fear?  dependency?  the unknown|`|AA10531094	Job security and investment in the pension.|`|hKax9Jl6aa	because no other jobs are giving them a chance, or theyre just lazy procastinators.|`|54P0TxR5aa	Easy said then done.

It also could be the frustration in the job making them coming out with remarks like that.|`|DvZdB66maa	There are a lot of reasons for this:    For one, with the bad economy, it is not that simple to just go out and find a new job... and they obviously need a job to pay the bills, so they stick with the one they've got. Of course, if they could find a better job, they would be gone, but it's not that simple in this economy.    Two. The pay at their current job is great! They may not like the work that they do, but they know that there is no other job out there that would pay as much as they make at their current job, with the set of skills or experience that they already have.    Three. They don't have a good set of skills, education, or experience, so the job that they have is probably the only job they can get... and they realize that. But maybe they don't have the money to pay for a better education.

rx20pKgOaa	Actually, here in the states where we really DO get tons of snow the schools almost NEVER close!  UT, WY, ID & MT, forget it.  We have school everyday no matter what.  I should know, I teach at a high school.  One morning during a snow storm it took me 2 hours to get to work, (usually a 35 min. drive) but they didn't close school even for that blizzard!    Last week the principal came on the intercom numerous times to warn about the freezing rain we were having and to drive carefully on the way home.  Sport games were canceled and the roads were sheets of ice the next morning. There were over 250 slid offs and accidents on the freeways in Northern UT. But did they close school?  NO!     So - point being, here where we get real snow we just plow through it.  I can't get over NV where they had a freak snow storm that dropped a fraction of an ice and they had to close the airport as well as the schools.  They don't have snow removal equipment so the airport had to wait for the snow to melt before planes could take off! LOLOL|`|UUJ5SqrAaa	yes and so are shops, banks etc.|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	I live in Portland Oregon.  They closed the schools hella long during christmastime. We had 2-3 inches of snow fall starting in the morning yesterday. Oddly enough they didnt close schools. I think because the temp got up to 40 and they knew it would melt.
AfbjU9Guaa	Kids have vivid and wild imaginations. Some aspects were likely real, such as the figure by the curtains. I've witnessed similar, but it's just your brain creating shapes in the dark that aren't really there. The kids then go on to create a whole story in their minds to make the sighting more interesting and fanciful for the listener... and then begin to form it as an actual memory as they grow up. I've done it myself.<br>  <br>  I can clearly remember as a child seeing a giant spider in a hedge outside my house, it was at least a foot long & wide, and it terrified me. I can remember then moving away from it and coming back later to find it had gone. I know what I saw but then I know it wasn't real, as I was just a child with a false view on life. Plus I had an impulsive fear of spiders back then so I'd have very likely thought the worst.<br>  <br>  Memory, it's an odd thing. Remember, your brain isn't perfect, nor is anyone else's. What you see, feel, smell, witness... all of it computed by something none of us understand in depth.|`|qGQUZM90aa	That was my Mother in Law, Kicked her out when she tried to give me a love-bite, don't know how she left you with teeth marks though, she is Gummy, she must have had new teeth put in, she's a horror, red eyes and all, always in black.

Iqp3ZUAlaa	The very first king was a supreme warrior who had allegiance of all of the troops.His best officers would form what was later to become the peerage,the king granting them lands to watch over and run for him.<br>  Today's monarchs are chosen from the line of succession,according to The Acts of Settlement.<br>  Britain is a Constitutional Monarchy.<br>  <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk/</a> can answer your questions more thoroughly:<br>  "Constitutional monarchy is a form of government in which a king or queen acts as Head of State.<br>  <br>  The ability to make and pass legislation resides with an elected Parliament, not with the Monarch.<br>  <br>  As a system of government, constitutional monarchy separates the Head of State’s ceremonial and official duties from party politics.<br>  <br>  A constitutional monarchy also provides stability, continuity and a national focus, as the Head of State remains the same even as governments change.<br>  <br>  The Sovereign/Monarch governs according to the constitution - that is, according to rules, rather than according to his or her own free will. The United Kingdom does not have a written constitution which sets out the rights and duties of the Sovereign, they are established by conventions. These are non-statutory rules which can be just as binding as formal constitutional rules.<br>  <br>  As a constitutional monarch, the Sovereign must remain politically neutral. <br>  <br>  On almost all matters the Sovereign acts on the advice of ministers. However, the Sovereign retains an important political role as Head of State, formally appointing prime ministers, approving certain legislation and bestowing honours.<br>  <br>  The Sovereign has other official roles to play such as Head of the Armed Forces."<br>  An elected Prime Minister shares duties with the monarch,acting very much like the president does.Not only must the Prime Minister talk to the House of Commons,he must listen to them and debate with them.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	The role of King or Queen varies from nation to nation, although they are always head of state.<br>  <br>  Ultimately the Government and the people decide who will be King, you can't force a leader on the people. A good example is the King of Spain as Spain only got its monarchy in the 70s.<br>  <br>  Blood lines are how the Monarchy keeps going but they generally start by invasion like in the UK or invitation like the Greek + Spanish monarchs.<br>  <br>  I don't understand this Question "Was it the founder of Britain through generations?"<br>  <br>  The Prime Minister and Queen have a kind of joint head of state position.<br>  <br>  The Prime Minister Runs government he works with the MPs to put laws in place, works with other heads of state etc.<br>  <br>  The Queen has regular meetings the PM where she discuses whats going on in the country and advises him on what to do next. The Queen spends most of the day going through paperwork, passing laws etc.<br>  <br>  The Queen has no political sway so represents all the people of the country unlike a president.<br>  <br>  The Queen is probably more like a President than the PM. They are both head of state, Neither of them can actually chose what laws they want to make. They both really just make sure government is running.<br>  <br>  I attempted to look up congress but it seems to be quite different to the UK government. Perhaps you could look at the UK government on wikipedia to get an idea.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	We think it better than having a president like George Bush.<br>  <br>  Kings and queens generally start from the Norman Conquest and are aranged in 'houses' - Plantagents, Yorks, Tudors, Stuarts, Hanover, then Saxe-Coburg Gotha (as the Windsors used to be known). It was generally decided by blood shed - William I invaded the country - the houses of York and Lancaster fought for it in the Wars of the Roses. <br>  <br>  We got rid of the king by chopping his head off in the 17th century and had Oliver Cromwell instead. He was such a killjoy (he cancelled Christmas) that we were glad to have a new king soon after. It may surprise you to know that Queen Victoria was German and married a German - so most of the descendants have hardly a drop of English blood in them.<br>  <br>  The government own most of the property that is generally associated with the Crown (The Crown Estate) This earns far more for the country than does the cost of the Royal Family (The Civil List as their allowance is called), but not a lot of people know that. The royals also have other duties - head of the Church of england, and head of the Commonwealth as the last vestiges of the old empire are now known.<br>  <br>  We elect the Prime Minister who is the leader of the governing party in elections - he or she can change in office as Blair was replaced by Brown. The Prime Minister is elected as any of the MP's Members of Parliament are - so there is none of the palaver that you guys have. <br>  <br>  The PM can last as long as they want (or the people want them) - so it is the ruling party that we supposedly vote for not individuals. (Although a poor leader like Neil Kinnock was for the Labour Party doubtless helped them lose).|`|ToztjpAsaa	The custom of a hereditary monarch is relatively recent; of the 33 monarchs between William the Conqueror and Queen Victoria, only 13 succeeded by straightforward hereditary right.|`|AA10067344	Kings, in Britain and elsewhere, generally rose up out of the warrior class.  Succession is hereditary.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	God....She is ordained by God... end of|`|NYU37jfGaa	The Queen's role is that of Head of State.  She is not directly involved in the government of the country, but she has to give assent to all bills passed by Parliament, and she has weekly meetings with the Prime Minister at which she advises him.  She meets and entertains other heads of state, visits other countries, and has a constant round of  official engagements.  In theory she could dissolve parliament if she wanted to, but in practice no monarch has done this for centuries.<br>  <br>  In Saxon times the King was normally chosen from among the previous king's close relatives.  He could nominate his successor, but the Witan (council) might choose another candidate.  After the Norman conquest (1066) the system of primogeniture (inheritance by the oldest son) gradually became the norm.  The succession could be disputed, and sometimes one king might be deposed and replaced by another, as happened for instance when Henry IV deposed Richard II, and Edward IV deposed Henry VI, and Richard III deposed Edward V.<br>  <br>  The power to appoint the next heir rested with the monarch, and occasionally you get a situation where the succession is doubtful, as when Elizabeth I was dying, and waited untl the last minute before naming her cousin James VI of Scotland as her heir.  There wasn't really anybody else suitable, but she coul dhave named someone else if she had wanted to.<br>  <br>  over the centuries, parliament gradually acquired more power, and the monarch's role became more constitutional.  Today the Prime Minister is the one who is actively in charge of the government.  If he wants to make any changes to laws, etc, the members of Parliament have to vote on the issue.|`|BI5H7shlaa	This is a very complicated question,and deserves a response but before i give my answer i must declare i am an anti monarchist.<br>  All our kings and queens are descended from ancient history when the survival of the fittest won the day,usually through force of arms,murder,rape,and pillage,in fact not a lot has changed really if you look at the recent history and i refer to the murder of our darling Dianna,but i digress,you would have to read and interperet the history books for most of them are written by monarchist sympathisers and and are a distortion of the truth,the recent history of the monarchy is of the robbing of the crofters in scotland by the monarchy,the land enclosure act by the monarchy,guess who owns that land now?ask any scottish historian about that,King charles the first lost his head because of his attempt to steal more land and property from the common people,and eventually succeeded in the name of charles the second,all these lands are now in the monarchies hands,<br>  A good description of our monarchy would be a beehive,with the big fat queen so fat she can hardly move with all the workers keeping her alive and giving their lives for her,the word parasitic family describes the monarchy,and they are experts at it,you think yourself lucky your forefathers had the guts to rid themselves of them,your question really deserves a more detailed explanation,but realise the queen is not universally loved and only kept in power by much more powerful people than even our government|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	The queens royal bloodline goes back to 1066 when William, Duke of Normandy invaded Britain and was crowned king of England.<br>  Our Royal family earn millions of pounds from Tourism in Britain as well.

It was based on bloodlines.|`|DB4RRjXTaa	The royal family are currently half greek half german by descent but those countries saw sense and got well rid very quickly.<br>  <br>  The prime minister though, who lots of people complain about, was elected, so some people want him where he is (we never got a choice with the royal family we just pay for them...)|`|g4lLX3iaaa	It was,survival of the fittest but now it goes through the blood line.<br>  reginald r,you are so much more plausable when you don't stoop to insults.|`|GI27dKIkaa	I'd much rather have a Royal Family - than an elected president anyday !|`|gwZseZWyaa	We have a Prime Minister and not a President because we have a queen. Your President does all the things both our queen and Prime Minister do, put together, i can't remember what roles the queen has though, the queen is above the Prime Minister so she has to give approval before things happen etc, i think. The Windsors have not ruled for long, i think i saw someone else mention like only a 100 years which sounds right and the royal family maybe were once tribe or clan leaders, if America was old as us maybe you might of had a royal family too lol, like most countries have or did. Btw Scotland use to have a royal family too, long while ago, thought i'll mention it as no one else has, till King James II stopped it, i guess there was a battle of some sort.|`|g09x06Zpaa	In the beginning of GB, it was a lord who conquered the local villages and made them his subjects. But after that, whoever killed the king got control of his kingdom, so the bloodlines have changed over the centuries.|`|yvKktDapaa	in the olden days the monarchy (king or queen) was in charge of the country.like a prime minsiter or president.but i dont know when the stoped being in power and a prime minister came in.know all there here for is to attract tourism|`|mA7CAwdLaa	No. This batch of royals only goes back in Britain for the last 100 years; prior to that, they were Sachs-Coburgs, European royals that changed their name to Windsor to sound more English.|`|v811KD7raa	theyre to stop politicians thinking theyre god and making big mistakes<br>  <br>  thats why many americans want a royal family|`|ed658ab54221fdf8e76c9f6718308484aa	Our Queen does diddly squat for us and our prime minister is a spineless creep with only one eye on the game,,yes and they both have bad teeth and sad dress sense.|`|f8ewmXsXaa	I will start from the beginning although you can go on www.britsattheirbest.com and research it in more detail there. <br>  <br>  The Monarchy derived from the people wanting a hierarchy and a leader and thus it began. when it came to the next leader of course it was natural and most logical that it should be the child of that leader and so on. There were leaders of tribes all across britain with various sized kingdoms brought about by military power or through unions of marriage merging families and therefore kingdoms too.<br>  <br>  The Monarchy or leader of that tribe would be responsible for everything, law and justice, protection and military might etc. obviously because of tribe wars and the various conquests of Britain new leaders were established and new kingdoms became bigger and more powerful and so on.<br>  <br>  Alfred the Great developed the common law (still in use and read on it is relevant). The coronation oath was established and first taken by king Edgar. The Magna Carta was established by the kights baron and reluctantly signed by the anti-knight king john. statute of Westminster. The Petition of Right, Declaration of Right and Bill of Rights. The Act of Settlement of 1701. The Act of Union. first and foremost the duty of the monarchy even to this day is to be the protector of these laws. these are the laws of the British Constitution, which is a bond between Sovereign and people to uphold their liberties even from parliament. <br>  <br>  other duties include official visits, reading peoples letters and pettitions to her, meetings with the prime minister so that they can report on the state of the country, head of the armed forces, giving prestigious honours and awards to those that have contributed immensely to society. a focus to national identity/pride, pass bills of legislation etc that are benificial the the nation on the advice of her ministers. I think there maybe more but..<br>  <br>  The prime minister is 'supposed' to take care of managing the country and keeping it in order. He/she reports alone and directly to the monarchy weekly (I think its weekly) in the same way a area manager would report to the director or whatever you get my drift. <br>  <br>  ah yes and the monarchy also disolves paliament for the general election but has the power to do so before then if it is the sincere wish of the majority of the people of whom the ancient bond is between. <br>  <br>  I'm don't know much about american politics but, our house of commons is where the different parties lobby their arguements and questions with the speaker trying to keep the control so that answers may at a point appear. the different parties gain seats - group size based on public votes (I think.. yes). The commons is governed/overlooked/accountable to the house of lords (so long as labour members aren't there).<br>  <br>  The hierarchy is local government, the commons, the lords, the monarch. this what we mean when we call ourselves a soveriegn state. This is all so that government doesn't supress the liberties of the people. The government however have been taking more powers away from the monarch to the delight of the minority of anti-monarchists, but to me is rather worrying because she would be our only chance if we had a dictatory government to oust them, which is getting to that stage to be honest.

39AG0S5Uaa	once there was a family of 5 with learning/other disabilites; a father, mother, teenage daughter, baby son. they claimed to live in a house sort of isolated in the woods that was right next to this one beach but not too far away from town. sometimes this guy named joe would go to the beach to relax and the family would be there too, and he felt bad for them and became friends with the family. joe thought they must be getting help with their disabilities somehow, but as he got to know them he found out that they lived an isolated life and became concerned. Then, one day they showed up at the beach all looking very proud, because the teenage daughter was carrying a bundle of blankets and said her new baby was inside. joe was scared for them; they obviously could not support another person, and she was only 16, too young to be a mother. but then he asked who the father was, and the girl's father stepped up and proudly stated that he was also the baby's father. This left joe shocked and freaking out, he needed to get them some help. finally, they said, 'please look at our baby before you go! he is so beautiful!' the girl pulled apart the blankets, and he looked... and saw a dead infant's carcass. joe ran away and reported their problems and tried to get them help. people looked and looked for their house, but they found nothing... and the family was never seen again... creepy unsolved mystery. <br>  <br>  btw its a true story. tell your friends that it happened where you are camping|`|aUScPZFYaa	Tell them about the Bunny Man and they'll **** there pants.|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	tell them  to  check  out the  frat boys  at the  gay  porn sites  and  you  should have  plenty  of  material<br>  <br>  .|`|IJMyRWp4aa	omg there is this one that my sister would tell me when i was younger. here it is.<br>  <br>  One day Jane woke up  and today was a day like any other, she went to the kitchen and had breakfast and then walked to school. When she came home her dad sitting in the recliner reading a newspaper, her mom was in the kitchen cooking dinner and her little brother was playing video games as they always were when she came home. The next morning she went through the same routine and then walked home after school when she got home she was shocked to see her dad wasnt in the recliner reading the newspaper, her mom wasnt in the kitchen cooking dinner, and her brother wasnt playing video games. they were no where in sight and she went to look for them and couldnt find them anywhere in the house. she went to look in the back yard, it was there she was presented with the sight of the family dog eating her entire family. the dog had blood all over his mouth and chewed at the bloody pile of parts in front of him then he looked up at jane and AAAAHHHH<br>  <br>  ...ok yea thats it, it used to scare the hell out of me lol.

It should be translated as "the grave," or the "place of the dead."  No one has gone to the final hell yet.  It is what is called '"the lake of fire," as referred to, after the final White Throne Judgment, which will not happen until after the thousand year reign of Christ on earth.  <br>  <br>  Those who have died in the past and those who die now, without Christ as their savior, will go to a place of torment, but it is not the final hell.  However, they will eventually go through the White Throne Judgment and be cast into the Lake of Fire, which is the final hell.  Once they die, there is no chance of ever being saved after that.  <br>  <br>  Although, it may be a sin to commit suicide, that is not what sends a person to hell.  What sends a person to hell, is the rejection of Jesus as their savior.<br>  <br>  By the way, I don't have to prove anything to anybody.  If you don't believe in hell, that's your choice.  If you really want to know, then read the Bible for yourself. Don't be a fool.  It's your own eternal soul you are risking.|`|Nxolwd5Baa	this reality could be considered hell, we "burn" with our desires and are never truly happy or finding an answer....<br>  dont worry though as we chose to come here, we chose to experience time and space and when we die we'll wake up from this "dream" and do something else, hell and heaven are just human interpretations of that real truth...(imagine a computer character in a game trying to understand binary code, same thing)|`|0PhY8dRIaa	if everyone without christ is currently in hell, then the ratio of souls in heaven to the souls in hell is probably about 1:500000.<br>  <br>  But, this is all assuming that such places even exist. :)|`|LCZChP7Maa	The bible clearly states, "the dead are conscious of nothing" Eccl 9:5.

Classically, 'black magick' is any magick done for your own profit regardless of what may happen to others. If that's illegal then we should arrest 90% of the business-people in the Western World.|`|AA10067344	As far as I know, in the United States, there are no laws regarding the use of magic.|`|X8fwBpsyaa	That would depend on what country you live in. In America and the UK practising any magic (provided you don't break individual laws, for example possessing certain herbs used in black magic may be illegal), is perfectly legal. (Ethics are another matter, but just because something isn't ethical, doesn't mean it's automatically illegal.)<br>  <br>  There are however, countries which still have anti witchcraft/sorcery/black magic laws, and people found guilty of practising (not necessarily the same as actually practising) them can be punished with a variety of unpleasant sentences, including death. (I believe Saudi Arabia is one such place). <br>  <br>  There are also places where it's not technically illegal, but if you're believed to be a witch or practitioner of black magic, your local community may take matters into their own hands (this is quite common in certain parts of Africa for example), and being killed because your neighbours think you a witch can be a real possibility.<br>  <br>  <br>  And to Shwaa: You need a licence to keep a dragon as a pet as it's considered a dangerous wild animal. So keeping one without a licence is illegal. But keeping one if you have a licence is not. So your answer is no real help to the asker. It's not like you have to have a licence to practice black magic otherwise it's illegal.|`|NxL4C1DMaa	In North America, the practice of witchcraft or magic is not illegal. There are some countries (probably more in the area of Africa) where one can still be killed for the practice of Witchcraft. <br>  <br>  A Ouija board is a device used to seek guidance from the Spirits. I do not recommend using them, as more novices or those with no experience in spirit communication use them and could invite those undesirable/negative spirits into the home, and not know how to get rid of them.|`|vhlORK4Waa	Black magic - oh dear, sounds like someone's been at the Dennis Wheatley novels <joke><br>  <br>  Magic is neutral - it is manipulation of natural forces, it is the intent of the person that bends the magic <br>  <br>  Every religion uses magic to a greater or lesser extent - it is also the application of will, the act of changing consciousness in accordance with will - praying is a form of magic, transubstantiation is a form of magic, charms are a form of folk magic, ceremonial magic with all its ritual is another form.....<br>  <br>  Magic can be very simple, and very complicated all at the same time.<br>  <br>  You are right to leave it well alone. SErious magicians take years to learn and practise, and  hone their skills.<br>  <br>  Ouija boards are marketed as a game, allegedly one is supposed to be able to make contact with spirits/the dead, but no-one checks with the dead to see if they want or can talk to the users of an ouija board.<br>  <br>  I;ve been a Wiccan priestess for over 20 years, and I wouldn't touch an ouija board with a bargepole......not that it is part of my faith or anything, because it isn't anything to do with it, I think they are silly and dangerous all at the same time.<br>  <br>  Halcon<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|Gt5JzC2Daa	Many magical fraternities/groups have oaths/bylaws which all members are expected to abide with, which state "don't do black magic". If someone is deemed to have seriously/intentionally broken these oaths then they are quite likely to be thrown out of those orders. (but that's not quite the same as being illegal)<br>  <br>  Only UK law that went anywhere near this subject was the now repealed Fraudulent mediums act (1951). It is covered, "deliberately false prophecy" which could be considered as a kind of " black magic" as it is to deceive. (NB This law allowed the possibility of a medium not being a fake- burden of proof was to prove the "medium" set out to deceive)<br>  <br>  The Intent of the EU's Consumer Protection Regulations, seem to be to prevent consumers being conned out of money, because of false/unprovable claims made regarding a product/services effectiveness. If a Magician ("Black", "White", of any kind,,,) sells a "product", and makes a claim about that product and can't back that claim up with evidence than they would fall foul of that law.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/apr/06/eu" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/apr/06...</a><br>  <br>  NB selling/divination by an Ouija board (or similar) shouldn't be contrary to this law, if it was implicitly sold "as is"/"a game", with no claims about accuracy/no cash changes hands.

My religion/beliefs doesn't say I have to turn the other cheek, so If someone DELIBERATELY has a go at me, or "that which I care about", then ethically I usually recon it's OK for me to attempt having a go back, using magic.

Go out to dinner, the two of you, or cook him dinner with candlelight and soft music playing.  You can make it special without a lot of money.  I personally wouldn't go for the tatoos, but it's different for different people.  Whatever is special and suits your personalities, just to make it a day that is not like every other day of the week.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	tattoes can be fairly expensive X's 2. find cheap tickets to a concert, then suprise him with a small gift when you're there.|`|VIFxtHdPaa	Dont get a Tattoo   get a Freaken Peircing
