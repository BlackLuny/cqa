20090304070344AAU95pU	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	What do you expect or want when you go to eat at a casual dining restaurant?	You and your family or you and your friends decide to go and eat at the newest spot in town.  Their food is on the lines of burgers, wings, taco salads, green salads, footlongs, philly cheese stks, etc...  Items of that nature.  So as you pull up to the establishment, what would you expect to see, the curb appeal or the overall appearance of the exterior of the restaurant?  You park, get out and are walking up to the door, you open the door, walk in, its a order and pick up establishment, but you have plenty of seating, and windows to view the outside while you dine.  So what would expect to see on the interior and also what would you expect from this type of business in an overall perspective.  Be honest please.

20090304082655AAlEAoH	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	Does anyone become offended by someone honking their nose in a restaurant while you are eating?	Blowing your nose in a restaurant is a NO-NO in our family.  It is so gross, we have stopped eating our meal and asked for to go boxes.  Do people not realize how rude and selfish this is?  They got to enjoy their meal, snot free!  Nothing is worse than sitting down to a nice dinner with your family at a local restaurant, than for someone- man or woman- to blow their nasal cavity out their ears just as you are taking a bite or swallowing your food!  Of course, after their meal is complete. I hate it!!!  I have decided the next time it happens, I will speak my peace to the snot blowing, vulgar, didn't your momma teach you better, heathen pig!!!  Wiping your nose because it is dripping is one thing, but honking it while others are eating is quite another!  People have some respect for others, could ya?? You can always excuse yourself or wait until you leave the dining area, please!!  This is considered bad manners in my book!
