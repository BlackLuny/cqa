DNCpCjqjaa	I think he is proud of you....it sounds like you accomplished a lot and you should be proud of yourself.  But you don't need to seek his approval, because chances are he might never actually tell you that he is proud...guys aren't like that in most cases!! But you should be proud of yourself no matter what anyone else thinks. Try talking to him about it sometime!|`|2ix8vm1Naa	Yea definitely, there no reason why he should think the other way around. Im sure he's happy for you like anybody else would be. But if anything you should talk to him, not to showcase your independancy but to me he sounds like someone that was special in your life you guys should be friends & enjoying how good life turns out even afterwards.<br>  He's proud, & good luck.|`|Bs7Z0Mvhaa	Sweetie, if he isn't proud of you for your accomplishments, he's a moron.  I don't know you at all and I'm very proud of you.  There are so many people, guys AND girls, who would rather use someone else than to earn what they want.  I give you big props for standing on your own two feet.  I'm proud of you.|`|jz7dbg2saa	I think he is regretting the fact that he left you now, as if he didn't leave you, he would have better life...e is feeling stupid i think ....lol...hope you don't think this is stupid answer or offensive answer:P<br>  <br>  pls could you answer my question now?? <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AsZrrVUQ7TeDJtIT606A.Njsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220071252AAK3kRC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ZCe0DfFTaa	Yes he should be. You havent done anything bad to him so there isnt anything he should should hate you about. You should go see him too. It will make both of you happy.|`|gPYTkIW2aa	There is no way to tell. Just ask him. You have nothing to lose.<br>  Good Luck!<br>  :)|`|RyYV3aXlaa	sounds like its time that YOU moved on. get over your self.|`|97fbce5e0565e70c10d256648252d256aa	great you have done well for yourself. Now forget him and MOVE ON!|`|bwxWJ0nVaa	He may be proud of you but if you stay away from eachother because you both have feelings for eachother then why stay away at all...you two may be happier then ever before now...the only reason i'm saying this is because this is in a way what i am going through with my girlfried or ex whatever you want to say and i would love nothing more than to be with her right now!!!|`|JppKTOPnaa	You are obviously proud of yourself. You shouldn't be worried about what he thinks. I no thats easy for me to say but honestly you will only empower yourself even more when you stop caring about what people think and focus on your own goals. It was his mistake to let you go when you were nothing, it would be messed up for him to commit now. Do yourself a favor and shoot for the stars. Find a companion that is fully compatible with you because he obviously wasn't.|`|d9ff71ba6926a7e441cf9bed27ec8319aa	Yes I think he is proud of you. Who wouldnt be if they are your friend? But I think you are lying to yourself if you believe that is all you want.  It sounds like you are still thinking about him and still want him to love you.  If he is not with you then he is just not that into you.  Read the book and move on.|`|dcf4c1dec6ae1f9fba85b09be4c45028aa	I not sure how he feels, but my concern is why is it important to you whether he is proud of you or not?  You have shown that you could go out on your own and be successful, but in becoming successful did you do it at the cost of relationships?  Are you feeling alone?  Are you alone?<br>  <br>  I would love to help you with this but I need more information.<br>  <br>  Have a great life.|`|3b6eEugsaa	Call him and ask him to lunch or something like that. Get together and talk with him about how both of you have been since you broke up. You will be able to see his feelings in his eyes. If he's proud of you (and i'm sure he will be) then you will know it. <br>  <br>  Who knows? you may become great friends afterwords!|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	of course he is proud, why wouldn't he be? but more importantly you should be proud of yourself and really don't need to be worried if he is proud of you or not. this also brings up the question of did you accomplish all this for yourself or him? i hope for yourself|`|zwbldiV0aa	It shouldn't matter if HE is proud of you. You have to be proud of yourself!<br>  <br>  Good for you, now stay on the right track and don't date anyone or move in with them unless they have the same feelings and ambitions as you do.|`|OpVysSzQaa	if he doesn't have strong negative feelings towards you, I can almost guarantee he'd be proud of you. if he's a decent respectable guy for the most part, he'd be proud of any friend's accomplishments, including your own.<br>  <br>  :)|`|dz324UIoaa	i think he is not proud of u because if u are proud of someone u go to him and express your feelings to him and show that u are proud of him.i think he is jealous.|`|pL3HVNRjaa	I'm sure he is but why do seek his recognition? Are you still in love with him??? If so get um back if not leave it alone.... You knnow what you did and how amasing it was so why does it matter if anyone else recognises it. you did it 4 u ;P<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|V0iGdZDSaa	I am sure he is proud of you. though that is not what really matters. The only opinion that you should worry about is your own. if you are proud of you then great. more power to you. =)|`|Pliowfddaa	im sure he is proud <br>  afterall anybudy that can get all of that on their own and just have finished scholl has got to be prity amazing|`|01kEoI0Oaa	i didnt feel like reading but you should go out with him|`|DooJ5iDGaa	I fully understand i felt the same way , i achieved so much after me and my ex broke up after three years. I didnt see him or spoke to him for a year, when i finally talked to him i wanted to in a way show off myself so he could show some affection towards me i would say being proud of me would feel like a type of close affection, <br>  After a while i came to realize , that when you are proud of yourself those who love you and care for you will be prooud of  you , <br>  They dont mention it , or maybe dont know how to express it , but they are.|`|bzgo59anaa	OK.....First of all, Im sure that he has heard your doing well and has said to himself "good for her." doing things an your own can be hard! as to your comment that you "just stay away cause of the feelings" are you reffering to your own feelings? because it sounds like your still having some issues with the whole situitation. Im not saying there is anything wrong with that, when you care for someone i think that is to be expected but.....my conscern is this: why are you so worried as to wether he is proud of you or not? why? be proud of yourself !!!!!! be confident in yourself !!!! you did it on your own, you have your own things. (sang to the beat of "miss independent"...lol) be proud of yourself !|`|uBkvqcY6aa	Sorry but you're looking for approval from someone that by all rights shouldn't matter.  The answer to this question is IT DOESN'T MATTER whether he's proud of you or not.  It matters if you're proud of you.|`|mAZi1eH7aa	He is your ex. There is no reason for either of you to care. I am sure he wishes you well and is glad that you are okay, but that is where it ends.<br>  Find someone who will appreciate you and actually love and care. You are wasting your time on something that most men would not give a second thought to. You are his ex.|`|AA10684513	He is probably proud of you and at  the same time a little jealous.  You achieved so much without him.  His ego may be hurt a little also.  Give him time he will come around and tell you he is proud and happy for you.|`|TWzOmqqYaa	I am pretty sure that he is proud of your success. The reason his family likes you is because of him. I bet he still talks about you to his family. Just give him a chance, he will get back for sure.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Proud, or maybe even feeling sorry for himself for letting you slip away.|`|AA10358220	hey i'm proud of you..ya it hard starting out or even startin over in life in general(relations)..most of all you should be proud of your self lady... and if he was just a stepping stone.then be it...move forward and learn from the good and bad stuff...nothin wrong keepin it in your heart,but can't make ppl love...needs to go both ways..good luck on your life and you deserve the best life has out there.and maybe guy god is gettin ready for you when your not lookin..peace girl..Sc

wia9SXCPaa	Been married 20 years and my purpose for the first 15 years was doing whatever made my husband happy.  It was all about supporting him in his dreams and endeavors.  When the children came it shifted more to what was best for the family unit.  The problem along the way is that I lost myself.  <br>  <br>  You need to have purpose in your life beyond marriage to be truly happy.  I see that now that it is probably too late for me.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|BLXSOSBbaa	I agree with "Starting Over". My whole life was my husband, home, and "our" life. Our divorce was final just a few weeks ago. This whole year has been a major major identity crisis for me. I'm forced to start over never really knowing who I am unconnected to whatshisname.I thought I was doing the right thing. I am just lost without my name ,my home ,my husband,.....everything I thought was "ME" wasn't. <br>  It seems to me that to be truly happy with a purpose, that purpose should focus on becoming a complete whole person alone. No one can make you happy. To take a needy psyche into a marriage, or to evolve into someone less than YOU spells disaster for marriage 100% of the time. What if your spouse disengages, and takes away your life and all you know to be true?|`|MuVKeK8faa	Take care of my family is my purpose now.  I was never afraid of death and loved living life on the edge...now I think twice and worry about what they would do if something happened to me.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Yes, I have found purpose in my life, it is my children.  I do everything for them, they are my life.|`|mAZi1eH7aa	I always had purpose. Marriage just added someone to share it willingly with and hers too.|`|29hcn9JRaa	Even though Im married, I can honestly say that just because someone gets a piece of paper that says their married doesn't equal finding a purpose, as finding a purpose in life is a rather personal journey that a person can find with or without being married, or having children etc. This is why some people get married or have children prior to being actually ready, as they think they need a reason to wake up in the morning, and their reason is based on another person, you can't gain a purpose in your life until you find clarity within yourself. Personal growth along with liking who you are is the key to finding a purpose in your life.  Penelope|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	I've found that it is really nice to live for someone else as well as myself. When there is another persons feelings and emotions wrapped up in everything I do it makes me want to strive to be a better person. To accomplish goals that I never had before. To be good enough for my future children and to want to provide for them the things I never had. It has definitely been a kick in my a** to get going and start doing something with my life|`|bKK2fPiVaa	I don't think anyones purpose should revolve around someone else.  Your purpose is the journey of your own life... your spouse, kids, friends, family and everyone you meet on the street help you become who you are, but them being in your life doesn't give it purpose.  That's your job and your job alone.<br>  I love my husband and he adds so much to my life.  I love being his wife and best friend, but he is not my purpose for existance.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	No.  I'm now 40 and married for 12 years.  I always used to think about the meaning of life, and I'd have to say I am no closer to understanding it.  I have no idea.<br>  <br>  I have learned, however, that life is not perfect... will never be and can never be.  So... just relax and do whatever.  in fact, don't be afraid to screw around.  How can you be blamed for something when you weren't given any instructions in the first place?
E4W6KxCMaa	No sorry,it'snot a date unless one of you asks the other, and it sounds like it's a good thing given the description of the 2 men.<br>  <br>  It will happen.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God Bless!|`|HPtpfqFJaa	You married someone without dating them first? What is this, 1852????<br>  <br>  No, you haven't. Put yourself out there and have fun! Why the heck would you go into an arranged marraige?
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	hope you parents come around after they meet your girlfriend...|`|n58wkXEuaa	Sorry to hear about that....<br>  like you, I embrace interaical dating... yet my parents aren't as open-minded about it. They don't have so much of a problem with the guys of my preference, which happen to Asian.<br>  <br>  Race doesn't matter,... appearance flares the interest in a relationship. But some people may have a personal problem with other races, or believe in the negative generalizations of that race. I'm sorry to hear of your troubles, but maybe they would lighten up if they could see how happy you are with a Caucasian girl?<br>  <br>  Hope things go well....<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  It's just your personal preference- 100% normal. Most of everyone has a preference. :]
Uj5kuzoJaa	Woa this is hard lol. I don't think that there is anything you can say to him that will make him ok with this situation. First things first you need to stop dating him asap. It's not fair to him if you keep on pretending. Secondly, does the sister like you back? If so then you and her need to get together and talk this thing out. You both need to come up with some way to bring this up slowly to your bf. If you two really want to be together, you'll eventually have to tell him. He might be angry and hurt, but hopefully in the long run he'll be ok. If the sister doesn't like you back, then don't tell your bf. It's hard enough if your gf tells you that she's interested in her own sex, let alone his sister. But you still need to stop dating him and living a lie. This is a really difficult situation and I hope this helps a little bit|`|lYjweuZmaa	idk good luck with that though|`|eS9nPWqBaa	That would be weird...don't do it.<br>  <br>  More than likely it would end your relationship with him.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	thats like telling your bf that you like his brother. <br>  i dont see a big difference... except if you have just discover that you are lesbian and you cant be with boys.|`|sCBJHVtzaa	Okay, go up to him, and say this:<br>  "I have a crush on your sister"<br>  <br>  Results may vary.|`|96zZlJVYaa	its best that you don't unless you're trying to make a move on her.|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	ewwie...umm wait ur rainbow ?|`|mtOVRAnbaa	I wouldn't if I were you.. If your just "coming out" then i wouldn't suggest just jumping into a relationship with your current boyfriends sister.. You don't even know if she feels the same way about women as you do..  you might get hurt in the end on that part supposing she doesn't "dig" the whole girl on girl situation.. I'd be single for awhile... way your thoughts and feelings.. =) good luck..|`|qeVqBMVraa	Just tell him that you lesbian!<br>  And then go to God to have mercy on you cos being Homo is a sin|`|7K2HVodhaa	Take it to Jerry Springer, of course.|`|5IO1JEY1aa	Sweet!|`|4a935e7214c87d8ea74ee87e5ba46224aa	your rainbow?|`|RyYV3aXlaa	just say "honey we need to talk"|`|rzLGCrlfaa	lol thats great|`|wHTErwGgaa	Well, make sure your boyfriend knows your bisexual & that you don't just hide it away.<br>  <br>  This is the shortest advice I've given really but it's simple as. If you prefer your boyfriends sister to your actual boyfriend then the best advice is to be single for a while. So much so that you can even start a thing with his sister in later life, if that's what she wishes<br>  <br>  Talk to his sister|`|kqSTDuA6aa	Uummmmm. First and foremost, is she rainbow? If not, nothing's going to come of it and there is no need to say anything to him. If she is, then come out shootin'. "I'm into a girl, and it's your sister".|`|bwxWJ0nVaa	simply talk to him about it, ask him how he feels about it, it maybe kind of weird considering it's his sister but then again it could very well be a turn on...just talk to him about it would be the best advice!|`|XT81GCu1aa	Don't go there.  That's like telling your boyfriend you like his brother.  Family comes first, and you'll probably lose your b/f AND her friendship.  Choose someone else if you must.|`|4S8IKFn0aa	First u tell him that u like girls too (this will make him happy)<br>  Then u tell him that u like his sister (now it's not quite a let down)|`|jfOSVSQkaa	Tell him you're a lesbian and like girls now, and if he would mind you messing around with his sister instead of him.
eGpOIV12aa	he doesnt have a clue.<br>  <br>  if he cant go out of his way to spend any time with you, then he probably isnt worth it
QK7ssy2Xaa	wow that is odd. It's cute that people leave numbers but if she's actually calling them and texting them back when she has a bf thats just plain rude and inconsiderate. She has to understand your feelings. Tell her to picture it the other way around. And ask her how she would feel. You def have to tell her if bothers you. It is being jealous but who wouldn't be jealous? A little bit of jealousy is good, it means you care.|`|fb2d92b771dcd4d8b2d1dc3da6af3e05aa	Depends on what kind of relationship you have and want.  My ex, she keeps her options open and is always looking for someone better.  First it was just text msg, then talking, then the nude pics and webcam.  things of course went down hill and I took the not so subtle hints to leave.|`|WP36jh6Zaa	nope. u dnt seem jealous. tell her about herself.. shes wrong. im sure if the tables were turned, she would not b comfortable with it... actually its kinda of disrespectful.|`|XT81GCu1aa	Your girlfriend is totally in the wrong.  Try telling her nicely again and if she blows you off, well you might need to cool it with someone who just blows off your feelings like that and acts immature, right?|`|FTHoPLTXaa	Be straight up with her and tell her that you are not comfortable with her texting strange men that she doesn't even know.  To me that's disrespect and I wouldn't do it.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	a guy that just has sex with you and doesn't want a relationship doesn't love you...|`|bZGv0dvnaa	:facepalm:  ur just his booty call
222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	Dump him.  He should be totally devoted to you and never spend time with anyone else except when you say he can for the rest of his life.<br>  <br>  It's just going to get worse if you don't nip it in the bud, GF.|`|637425337df7c9e767eafff511b43419aa	Dang all the 0's confused me! wow are you still in grade school? I think if you are you need to concentrate on your school work. If not maybe you should go back to school.|`|7vt21U1naa	My boyfriend is he the same when i tell him he is been acting weird he goes like no not at all. I think you should tell him that you need more attention and he gets to hang out with you and not his groupies because girlfriends should come 1st especially when you're an awesome girlfriend you know? I'm planning on doing the same to my boyfriend. So just tell him he shouldn't just ignore you unless he is busy with something important and not video games. The problem with my boyfriend is sometimes he doesn't text at all. Then sometimes he texts me at like 4am "Good morning" He is a marine so i guess he is busy but yeeah he doesn't ignore me when he is planning video games. Tell your man to grow up and start taking responsibilities for you. Guys really need to know that us girls want a lot of attention. but they don't =[|`|CJvHQl5vaa	Blowing off all your friends to put 100% of the attention on your relationship is very unhealthy.  No one person can fulfill your every need.  A good balance of time together and time apart, with each of you taking some time alone, and some time with friends is what is healthy.  It sounds like he needs normal, healthy time with friends and with doing other things besides being with his girlfriend all the time.  That just makes him normal.|`|sCBJHVtzaa	You have to balance both a boyfriend and friends.  It's not that hard and really, doesn't hanging out with one person for the rest of your life seem pretty dull???  Just because you hang out with friends doesn't mean you lose your attention from each other, it just means that you want variety.|`|ISbtuWdTaa	Honey, get over yourself, let him go out with his friends.  Go get you some friends too, you are being way too clingy.<br>  <br>  While you're at it, it is hard to take you seriously when you replace all -0f y0ur O's with 0's.  >_<|`|FTHoPLTXaa	If he is not willing to give you his all then leave him.  Don't be outrageous and so clingy that he can't go anywhere or see any of his friends but don't put us with him leaving you in the dust when you had plans.  Also remember, you are not his wife so he really doesn't have to choose you over anyone.|`|m2NUw8mpaa	CHICKS BEFORE DICKS!!!!! friends come first and if you think your guy is more important you will lose more friends the you will ever get because friends are more important. but you should dump him he sounds like a loserrrrr|`|AunZaJOEaa	Maybe its because you put 0 instead of o <br>  Bro before Hos!|`|Zjjl7hrOaa	i been through that.hes young and immature.<br>  <br>  y do u use zeros for o's?its confusing to read|`|CEKRPpZ6aa	break up with him.|`|OyWVqe23aa	he chose to keep it bro's before hoe's.  i do the same thing.|`|LRhG2lW6aa	Hey Diana,<br>  <br>  I understand your concern. But first thing you need to understand is every guy likes to hang out with friends. Being committed in a relationship does not mean that you will stop meeting your friends. Again it is specific to the individual. If you BF is sm guy who loves to enjoy his personal space and also hang out with the friends, you should understand his point of you as well. So just try to think hard about what type of person he is, whether he wants atleast some space to meet other ppl and stuff? If yes, atleast give him that much space then that would be really appreciated. If you want to enjoy his company then just tag along and enjoy time with him as well as his frds. Thats how both of you will be happy as well as together too :) <br>  <br>  Take Care and Good Luck.
aVbWrsVOaa	i think if you and ur ex went threw such a hard relationship and you still have feelings for each other than something must be right with you guys. and i know that the boyfriend that's treats you nice is great but if you don't love him then you should not be with him. you should tell him that you cheated on him so he can get closure and move on. this way he can be with a girl who loves him. if you get love he should be able to as well. im sure you and ur ex will have a great relationship if you both talk about the problem you had in your past relationship and make it better. but if the boy you cheated on wants to be friends i think you should. her deserves that. im sorry about what your going through im sure its really tough... i have been in that exact situation before and i know i made the wrong decision by staying with the nice guy who i didn't love. now me and the guy i loved who had the bad relationship doesn't talk to me. so take it from someone who has been there and get back with you ex... i hope that helps!|`|u00IdgT6aa	I think that if you love your ex u should be with him every realation ship has its ups and downs but if you truly love your ex then dont just lead your boy friend on just tell him the truth and maybe you guys could be friends afterwerds. if you dont love him the its not the right moment at this point in time.|`|RYZ8CVZTaa	i think the guy who u really like and the guy loves u back. that's wat matters. try dating ur ex again, see if anything changes.|`|evJ2GEodaa	neither, you're too young.<br>  And cheating is never right and kinda makes you seem trashy at your age and by kinda I mean really really really trashy.
mtOVRAnbaa	WAIT IT OUT!!! keep him on his toes =) good luck..|`|HPtpfqFJaa	Wait for him to text you, guys like a girl that makes them wonder, not one that is too attentive, they find it clingy. <br>  <br>  its spelled tomorrow not tamarro! jeesh|`|vlbCNihAaa	wait for him to text you, then the next time he talks to you or if he asks why you didnt text just say 'oh crap, i forgot':)|`|XLjSYo67aa	well if he told you to txt him tommorrow then text him dont wait cuz then he might think your not interested lol!|`|r7EW2cwwaa	I would say wait for him to text you but its up to you if you cant wait that long then text him there's is nothing wrong with text a boy that you like. You should try talking to him like he is a close friend like one of your guy friends then you can be more comfortable with him.|`|i9QFC9apaa	Its up to you if you feel like texting him go for it but if you want to wait you can|`|oVCjgL1taa	txt him or else he'll think u want him to do everything =\
0AYPgUQIaa	You can get all those things in a standard relationship too, it must be something else.<br>  A marriage is much more secure than a relationship and that gives you a sense of security. Most people want to get married, have kids, grow old together with their loved ones. This sets a goal for their life, gives them a sense of direction.<br>  There is nothing more troubling then the loss of that sense of direction, that's why you miss being married.<br>  Nothing would change if you would join the rest, you would still be caring in your heart, you would just lie yourself that you don't want to be caring.<br>  Don't change.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	what would a "promise" ring from a liar mean to you...|`|96zZlJVYaa	that is your called lady, I understand your disappointment in him and you should feel let down. sound like with this new job of his more and more he being letting you down. but I want to ask you this, do you still love him even all the let's down? if you still love him and fed up with these lets down from him. you need to make up your mind what is it going to be. now if all these lets down have taken a toll on your love for him, its time to go. so what are you going to do?|`|bc40a69a30a003422da4f7acebd6f59baa	You just need to sit him down and tell him this is what you want and your going to get me it now. He needs to know how much it means to you and that he is letting you down not buying you one. He doesn't even need to go to the store, you can buy them online!
uBkvqcY6aa	Flowers(always nice)<br>  A small necklace(not something that will turn her green)<br>  A teddy bear(from build-a-bear to show that you put thought into it)<br>  <br>  Basically anything you put more than 10 seconds of thought into she will probably appreciate more than just picking up anything.|`|2c2W4zQJaa	write her a hand written note saying how much you care for her<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you don't need to buy anything.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  the note will touch her heart because it came from yours.|`|AA10358220	brotha,keep it simple,maybe rose or 2 different colors & card and (maybe cheap stuff toy oppional)..but just be there and listen 2 her bro... your doin good just don't push to hard it'll come back to you..good luck man|`|hcIWJOzaaa	How about starting off with a single red rose?<br>  Or is there any personal jokes between you two and you could get her something relating to that.|`|6fa2568b75c06da2670c61858c9441ceaa	Honestly, all you need are some nice flowers to surprise her with.

Maybe a nice necklace would be it!|`|NxBYuOzbaa	Well, it all depends if you are in a serious relationship (like you are thinking about ever asking her to marry you), or if you are just dating, or if you guys are just friends.<br>  <br>  If you are serious: A promise ring (NOT an engagment ring)-make sure she feels the same way for you first, you don't want to seem in a rush, if you think a ring is too much, maybe a nice necklace with a heart pendant?<br>  <br>  If you are just dating: A stuffed bear, or flowers, or candy!<br>  <br>  If you are just friends: A single rose (yellow represents friendship)!<br>  <br>  Hope it goes good!|`|Rgj6kTOwaa	hmm what kind of things is she into?? maybe a CD of an album she has been after?? erm, a nice piece of jewellery? a necklace perhaps?? are u in a relationship or just friends or friends and wanting a relationship? it all kind of depends really! if your friends and wanting to be more, then something like the CD think of one she wants wud go down well i think, as it shows u have put thote into it! dont get her flowers thats to easy, just think of somethign she is really interested in, a favourite book, DVD, maybe a top, coat, jacket she has been after for a while??? something like that that shows u have thote about it hope this helps :)|`|TKbgtPMxaa	well you probably know better then us what she likes but if you've noticed if she wears jewelry or not, get her a bracelet, girls love that and you don't have to spend a whole lot and its simple but it shows you care, pay attention to details though does she wear gold or silver. good luck im sure you'll do great|`|bwxWJ0nVaa	well you could get her a necklace or earrings or something like that you can never go wrong there...but if you want to get more personal and intimate go out get some massage oil candles bath milk give her an intimate massage and the a bubble bath to was the oil off later set the mood with lit candels!

You don't wanna deal with it anymore and you'd like to be left alone. Take it out when he is not around. I'm pretty sure he goes out once in a while or work. So take it out when he is at work or something|`|sCBJHVtzaa	Wait, whats the big deal about the TV?

LzJJn1m7aa	One of the only reasons i fell for my husband was because he was a decent man that became my FRIEND first..an honest friend not one with other intentions in mind. He never gave me a signal that he liked me-he didnt hit on me or anything. Then one day after we had been JUST friends for 5mths he told me he had feelings. He was a gentleman about it-we wanna feel like you wanna know us not like we are a piece of meat, ya know? He should pay for us on the dates he takes us too, and treat us with love and respect. Thats a decent guy=)|`|CGBWxtAjaa	Someone that honest and treats you right

g0fATIaqaa	Because the guy knows that he has won the girl; there's no need to work for her anymore. Yea, guys are lazy that way, and it makes us feel like crap. Most guys assume that they're in the "safe zone" once they've hit a certain point in the relationship. I guess they do this because when it comes to relationships, guys are very simple minded. I know, it hurts, so maybe mention this to your guy the next time you feel like being appreciated a little more. A lot of the time, one person in the relationship gives so much, and all the other person does is take, and doesn't give back. If this is the case, then you need to have a serious chat with your man. Tell him how you feel, and go from there. I hope that helps :)|`|AA11683646	The whole romance option is for introduction.<br>  <br>  Once the relationship is established the it is supposed to be a more of a two way street.<br>  <br>  Why are the tools of attraction supposed to be used forever?|`|AA11841749	Good question, but not all men are like that.

It goes for women as well.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	they are playing the field. you probably are,nt what they want.|`|AA10266072	It's called getting comfortable with the person.

Three weeks I think you can wait, its not a whole lot and by the time  you actually plan it all out, get packed, etc, it will almost be time that you will see eachother.  Plus you should save your money for that and not have to pay for gas or a plane ticket, let him come to you! if he really likes you he will make the effort.|`|SovaFpN8aa	Trust your own instincts.

m84Ml3Opaa	First of all you're going to have to tell your friends to back off. I know they're  just trying to help, but it seems like it's having the opposite affect. Try that age old tactic of "accidentally" bumping into him, just to get his attention. Then just start start by apologizing then introduce yourself,and just start up a random converstation, giving him one of those flirtatous smiles. Sometimes you have to make yourself known, your friends can't do that.|`|8MpnQSe0aa	Actually there's no problem at all. He's totally correct in "I dont know that girl..

Facebook or Myspace it's better to get it personally.|`|Y7NpmZxMaa	Maybe if you went on myspace more and started talking to him, just talk about you know casual things and eventually you could tell him that it's your friends that have been talking to him and making him think it's you.

I mean a 20 year old had way different ideas of what a relationship is then ppl in their 30 and 40s.  Then again maybe she has a boyfriend and it was a one night drunk thing. If she hasn't responded by now chances are she won't and doesn't want to  sorry

And I doubt I'd be the only one in line.|`|96zZlJVYaa	what is a getto booty? wow, where does she lived and age please? sure i would!! but what is a getto booty?|`|dYN3bdnKaa	I know alot of guys who like bigger girls.<br>  esp since I love in the ghetto.<br>  <br>  you know, you sound like my friend..Elle???|`|PuV9lh37aa	No|`|4yiU7Qknaa	depends, is it fat or muscle?|`|nYgUfUd7aa	It would depend on the personality and if we clicked...<br>  <br>  BTW raven00, you are 6' and only 165 - do little girls toss you around like a rag doll or what...|`|AnfbrZFuaa	I'd take her out once to see if she's worth dating.|`|1iXvphNYaa	Don't see why not. I'd prefer her to lose about 20lbs though.|`|iD8z7KZBaa	If she's a woman, I'd date her|`|ZleVRevVaa	Yes i will....|`|aSvOaAjiaa	Sure|`|7K2HVodhaa	sure|`|5aXKo6uCaa	if its you-yeah|`|8ff68124c118183235586b4138170059aa	Probably not,that's not my type.|`|72c3b924e93e85f5493bc3f07051afb4aa	I think there are a lot of guys out there that would date a girl like that.  <br>  <br>  A person really cannot get an accurate idea of what you look like simply based on height and weight.  It's not a matter of who would date you, but rather who you would like to date.  Just be yourself and don't worry about it.  I always say, "Don't worry about finding the right person, but rather, be the right person and the rest will work itself out."|`|Xu71saGaaa	So my question here is... You are the chick and want to know if anyone would be interested. If you are that self conscience than I suggest some workouts and diet. A lot of people say that looks don't matter.. but I can tell you from experience that first impression is typically the looks.<br>  <br>  If you like who you are and are just looking for someone to like you as well.... I suggest building your self confidence. Guys generally like woman that know who they are and they are proud of it. Do not wellow in self pity.|`|jvWGnq6Laa	lol well from what u just told us, u sound perfect, to me anyway... beautiful and a nice personality, that just seems too good to be true these days :)|`|rdDM4lcxaa	just for the recors, she's NOT fat. according to her BMI,she's barely considered slightly overweight.<br>  shallow ppl.......|`|9cPZDkhpaa	All depends on how you carry the weight. My wife is hot and sounds similar to you and weights like 30lbs more than what she looks like|`|va94WcKZaa	Definitely!|`|cgHDDdalaa	me no. i dont have anything against you though. im sure your very nice, and goodlooking too but im not into bigger girls|`|sLWC6vEmaa	I wouldnt because she isnt my type, but there are many girls like that who get guys... and all guys are different.|`|YFXusnT1aa	YEP!|`|wA1dkeWRaa	as long as she has a pulse...... yes.......yes I would|`|RKLFYS2Naa	yes|`|qO5woDAgaa	na|`|4S8IKFn0aa	Ur fine. Stop referring to urself in 3rd person|`|WZQ6fRDtaa	I might. It depends. If you wan't more dates, lose weight.|`|hjhu0GWiaa	u notice how everyone on here is only concerned with the weight???
JNc4Xzfgaa	aww i only wish there were more guys like you. you sound like a great boy. i wouldn't worry so much, any girl would be lucky to hang out with you. just take it slow, only ask a girl to hang out when it feels like she's into you too.
Zd91le3gaa	usually they'll try to catch your eye or they will get your attention in order for you to notice them
135b47dd06c37bc042aa0969ad35cb25aa	Honey that's only two years difference! If you like him, go for it. Age is only a number. Don't me embarrassed about it because your friends think you should be dating someone your own age. They're not the ones dating him, you are. So do what makes you happy girl. Good luck. :)|`|BaNrweQ4aa	in my opinion i do think that is weird. especially in high school and things like that. it wouldn't matter at all if you were older and out of school. (it's just how people see it). erm; does he act/look older? that might make it a little better :) but.. then again - you shouldn't feel embarassed about who you like. can't you find someone similar around your age or something? there must be others out there. this 12 year old could possibly be a bit immature too :) lol|`|x6bbhRcHaa	whats the problem in liking someone younger than yourself.unless you find a person with exactly the same birthday as you(ie;the same age)there will always be an age difference.liking someone is beautiful,so enjoy it|`|1Lo34oEDaa	no y would that be weird age is just a number i think you shuld go for it as long as he respects you and treats you well its a good thing|`|yKK7ez7vaa	go for sex not for marry|`|uJDCoXH9aa	Yes, that's weird imo.<br>  <br>  Cuz, like has he even hit puberty yet?|`|mNxmoYMraa	I dont think its weird coz i like this lad n hes 14 nearly 15 n im 16 so not really no =D xx|`|LJkw276Laa	No of course not! its fine as long as you like him enough to be ok with that
xbzCxo8yaa	I truly believe in love at first sight.....................I married a man who said he loved me the very first time he saw me.........that man is now my husband of 19 1/2 years and 3 children lata................<br>  <br>  Anything is possible, especially if you believe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both|`|AA10975821	well ...............<br>  <br>  all i have to say is this, if love at first sight is real, then we all are in a lot of trouble!  <br>  <br>  i believe what you should be asking yourself is:<br>  <br>  what is it about myself that makes me want to leave behind what i have known before him and move in with a man i met for a week?<br>  <br>  what happens if this does not work out?  what do i have to fall back on?<br>  <br>  what if i find out later that he was not the person he was when i met him?<br>  <br>  listen: everybody puts their best foot forward to do whatever it takes to get that girl or guy.  when familiarity sets in, the true colors come out.  that is when the real relationship starts, when the real person comes out.<br>  <br>  generally, real real insecure, crazy people, wife beaters, etc tries to trap or lock down the other person so when the monster comes out, the other person feels they cant leave; or the other person is so blinded at this point, they do not see the craziness in somebody.<br>  <br>  insecure people attract insecure people.  you get what you are.  that is why you two "love" each other.|`|UKqJiIlGaa	be careful; love at first sight can be real but it can also indicate an abusive/controlling personality; give it time and see what happens
nqK90MGcaa	It's just the type of guy they are. Some men cheat, some don't. I know plenty of men that have been with their women for a long time and are entirely loyal and dedicated to them, to the point where they don't even notice a woman flirting with them.|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	Boredom and lack of willingness to experiment sexually from the woman.|`|PuV9lh37aa	They feel like a another girl|`|d85c9f54c1789376bcbba63672563679aa	We hv to accept the fact that, men are great liars, easy to succumb to temptations & egoistic.<br>  <br>  I once pop an open & direct questions to my ex-bf. What are some of MEN's DREAM. Other than career & $, he told me he will like to hv sex with a very sexy lady. But he did explain to me that it wasn't abt love. It's more like curiosity & a bonus to them. So i guess if they hv an opportunity to fulfil their dream, more likely they can't resist it.<br>  <br>  it's somewhat like women can't resist the temptation of getting a nice branded bag or clothing. However, you hv to understand, not all men who r unfaithful, hv stop loving their partner. It's a BIG MISTAKE they make. Probably i myself can't accept it either.|`|ce50d4262e9335129109e8d1bc22d29daa	this is so simple- boredom.<br>  <br>  though you really shouldn't generalize all men into this category. That's like me saying "why do all females get fat and lazy?"|`|4RiziMD0aa	I do think it's an ego thing. It makes them feel younger, cooler, better. A boost in their confidence but it still doesn't make it right. not all men are like this though.|`|9Ed7cgAFaa	They don't like their gf enough, yet they want steady sex.|`|32a92bbbf2d5ea9f7044c21f8c89eb63aa	If you dont think that women in long term relationships cheat as well you are crazy.  And the relationships you are speaking of now are probably with younger men.  in their 20s maybe?  People cheat because they are either unhappy, not in love, or have low self esteem and like the attention.  Women do it too.  There was actually a survey among college students aged 18-22 that showed an almost equal percentage of men and women that have cheated in their relationships.  So dont just think it is the men who are the ONLY cheaters.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Please stop all this generalization of genders.  It's getting really old.  You can't paint a gender with the same brush.  Enough already, one could ask the same thing about women.|`|80be183cc25c83d67c39e72c49dc6fc3aa	in my opinion...i think they are just trying to see if girls still want them. maybe they are a little insecure and wanted to see if they still have the magic... lol. kinda silly but it's kinda true.|`|H50lXUwIaa	This is a hardcore stereotype.<br>  I would never cheat on a woman<br>  those are just some shitty boyfriends.<br>  They are probably insecure.<br>  just slap them in the face!|`|aez3cIkvaa	A better question is why does the gf stay with the guy that's cheating on them?|`|wA1dkeWRaa	Because they aren't real men. They are still boys.<br>  I would reword your question.|`|1UptoEk4aa	Because you drive us to it<br>  <br>  aha : )|`|fAjJnfN9aa	Why do women generalize about men? Some men, just like some women, are bad, immoral people. Get over it.
qkLqlW4Caa	why can't you have him i mean dating your "roommate" is a little odd but mostly everybody does it. not meaning that you have to. but if you like him then go out. and if he goes to far - set boundries.|`|rvCbwX1Paa	it doesnt matter if he likes to cuddle, girl if he was rubbing on your hips and legs he wants you to, so maybe set up a situation like that again but when he starts to touch you, put your hand over his and guide him. then he'll know you're interested|`|NXJDsVfNaa	It depends on how much older the guy is...and the situation around why you cannot have him. <br>  Is he with someone else?? Are YOU with someone else??<br>  Are you a minor and he is an "adult"??<br>  Think about that, and then do what Breann C said about setting up the same situation. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rZWjPP9xaa	wtf y cant u have himmmm
8MpnQSe0aa	Let see, if a girl is apretty good friend of mine then I would feel happy with 40-80% shyness. Next thing I will do, i will reply "Why you said that?!" Coz some of thinks if this is a trick or just a question or a serious emotional impact...|`|YFXusnT1aa	It depends if she is my type then I would answer in a way that made her comfortable with moving forward with me. If not I would thank her and say I respect our friendship and dating may leave us with no friendship at all.
VCCzAyvsaa	Your pretty but I need to get a feel for personality.|`|0c0ywvuRaa	yeah, ur hella cute.|`|91HtgAadaa	Yes u r really hot and blonde daym. ya i'll date u.|`|edfyA9kPaa	omg ur so pretty i hate u! If i were a guy i would.|`|54qBK15laa	U look really great and i mean that.  I need to get to know u though.  Leave a phone number so i can text u.  i would date u if u were nice, sweet and had a sense of humor.  so leave ur number anytime|`|4SeOqA1Uaa	well, if I was your age I would date you. Nice cleavage btw :D|`|jvWGnq6Laa	well based on your looks than sure, you're real pretty :)|`|0p5c5gO9aa	YES I WILL CONTACT ME YOU ARE AWESOME|`|qn9NilP3aa	Personality, maybe? I can't give you an honest opinion without you saying what your personality is.|`|sCBJHVtzaa	Well I'm certainly not a boy, but in my opinion, your soooososososo pretty. and you have nice boobs i guess, and guys like that. haha. so yeah im sure any guy would date u.
SZzASlujaa	It sounds to me that ever since you messed up in the relationship, He doesn't see you the same. You kind of lessened your value to him. Now he wants to be friends be with benefits. What kind of mess is that? He's trying to treat you like a straight clappy. Or a quick hit rather. Did he call you since you guys had sex?|`|rvCbwX1Paa	booty call.<br>  I hate to say but it sounds like he just wants SOME parts of you back. Dont do it again without making what you want clear, and if he only wants the sex, well you have to decided if u can be happy with it. Dont fool yourself into thinking it is or will turn into more.
TXY6EAYqaa	Just don't touch her brother.|`|v6yEkCvHaa	but...ure girlfriend Is ure mum|`|pLgQZqW0aa	yeahh.. then you can go on jeremy kyle|`|AA11899313	Me thinks it would be most wise to seek permission before doing so.<br>  <br>  Hmm!  If you are planning on this course, don't you need a level of cooperation from the other parties involved anyway!<br>  <br>  Oh, yes. If you don't have any Life / Medical Insurance to date, you might be wise thinking about getting some ''before'' you attempt anything.  I do wish you the best of luck.<br>  <br>  Sash.<br>  PS: I'll be watching the TV News reports carefully over the next week or so.|`|PrqCDZ7raa	No, she's got very large labia minora and you won't like that|`|83TkWic3aa	*smack|`|hHndD5SEaa	ah sure you may as well have them both - why give up one!!? <br>  xx|`|yFeOTk3Baa	Um, let me think.  NO!!!!! It's her mom. She is a bazillion years older than you. Plus, she's probably married, to, let's say, the DAD! (I'm guessing btw). Don't do it. Maybe your girl will look like her mom when she grows up  ;)|`|7Ly4Ez26aa	that is jst wrong you should go out with your girlfriend nt her mother you met her first and you asked her out, y wud you want 2 swap jst because she looks hotter...<br>  Xxx|`|MYhQqeV7aa	Looks and shape change over the years, and are shallow ways to determine the woman who is right for you.|`|6Ur0KEHQaa	no! The mum won't be interested in you and you'll end up loosing everything.|`|xUDgtIcjaa	Do you even love you girlfriend :S !?|`|rpK7ZUKBaa	If shes named Mrs Robinson then yes!|`|gNUwLLTjaa	thats messed up right there.|`|uJLmbINyaa	and she'll have more experience so yeah do it|`|KM50wTbHaa	haha you should listen to stacy's mum to help you out! anyway no way! don't do it, you'll lose both but i don't think you should be with your girlfriend anyway since you don't seem to be all that interested in her so you're just wasting her time and yours.|`|G8fPtllVaa	no that would be wrong she is your girl you shouldn't go out with her mom just because she has a better shape she probably to old for you anyway it is just wrong but hey you can swap in your dreams|`|lpaUM0ceaa	Take my advice, and DON'T DO IT! Your girlfriend's mum is older! If you start getting feelings for her, and lose them for your girlfriend, then take things slowly!|`|bxlF3MEiaa	NO!! wtf?! do u even care for ur gf? then justy break up with her and move on, stop playing around with others people's feelings.
sCBJHVtzaa	so ask him to. or call him.|`|kp3JRi72aa	Sounds like he has a girlfriend or wife
x7uYAPaSaa	Get into it gradually. If you get me. Dont jump into doing things with her|`|edfyA9kPaa	Just do it! She wont think your a perve because thats what boyfriends are supposed to do.
WMR8hVlfaa	The way he talks to you, the way he looks at you, the way he says "I love you." Trust me, you know when he feels the same.
kMoQzxjGaa	real women don't shave. so there. i guess there will be no going down on anyone.|`|9twZdl6laa	Selfish much?  You expect her to do it for you but you aren't willing to reciprocate?  "Real" men would be willing to compromise.|`|dvxClOM9aa	A lot of guys shave these days.. I personally think it's disgusting when guys don't shave and if she wants you to shave and you want her to shave.. then why not?|`|e74UmsLxaa	Stop being a 'real man' and listen to her .She's got the equal right in ur relationship!! Shave whatever she wants!!
a35c4a3ab714036bfd3c31e133920f9caa	there is no perfect man. to make the perfect man you need all the following men:<br>  <br>  1.  old retired and wealthy.  this guy can buy you whatever you want.  all you need to do is hang out with him a few times and the money is just handed over.<br>  <br>  2.  the lover type guy.  this guy is for physical reasons only.  he does everything right in the bedroom.<br>  <br>  3.  a gay man.  this guy is the emotional part and he is the one you can talk to about the other two guys.<br>  <br>  so you see you put the three mention above and you have a great relationship...<br>  <br>  Sorry you said use humor...
WO3dtNB5aa	big business! the other twin is lily tomlin!
oyi2Fw5Waa	Well, it's possibly that she's interested, but it's not 100% If you're texting  her, you could make proposals and see how's she reacting. Also, it's almost weekend ... Why don't you call her and ask her out? :P You could see her reactions and get a proper answer to yourself.|`|AMTYPir7aa	ya know a phone call is much more personal than a text message. a positive response to a text message is your Q to call. what are you waiting for?
5N1rEjiqaa	Me<br>  About 4X per day|`|0c0ywvuRaa	damn, me and my gf are like rabbits lol. we do it all the time. **** we can go like 11 times in one weekends time. we love it. and at the same time we have a real relationship, we arnt just **** buddies. ive been with her for a year. but everyones differnt.|`|Xzfj17FNaa	well i dont get to see her as much as i like but we make up for it on the weekends, id say about 10 x in those two days but if i were home throught the week it would be more!|`|Q49EEdzbaa	you are still not old enough|`|LJkw276Laa	member this...<br>  if the beds a rockin dont come a knockin!!! you go boyyyy

Rb087BsAaa	Do you even try to date?  They just don't come running to you normally....it's a game.  You need to participate and be competitive.  Girls don't go for the guy slouched over in the corner....that's called pity sex.|`|eXTMwatMaa	Why?<br>  and do you like women?<br>  <br>  and No I think you should goo out and meet some women <br>  with some single guy friends of yours<br>  <br>  I know plenty of people not to be rude have a relationship and arent so attractive looking<br>  <br>  its not all about looks most of the time.<br>  <br>  or if you see a particulary women you like then go and talk to her ask her out<br>  <br>  in life everyones going to be rejected.<br>  <br>  You have to just go and do it <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck <br>  <br>  ;)|`|2IK3PvAEaa	I don't think it means your unattractive at all.  I think there are so many people (young and mature) who rush into dating or relationships just so that they are not alone.  I think when if more us held out for someone that actually deserves us we wouldn't go through have the headaches or heartaches we go through now.|`|3AoKeezxaa	Funnily enough, no actually. A lot of models have never been asked out cause loads of girls/guys are to scared too. <br>  <br>  Hope it helped, or at least boosted your ego :P
Eo0oeZMTaa	If you went to the doctor THAT day then it's gonna seem like you are sick whether you are or not. remember if you had the flu or flu like symptoms that it takes awhile to fully exit your body. Wait a few days and if she says something else than you know she is purposely denying you.
kU5Xv2i2aa	You need to pull him close, stare into his eyes and tell him how badly you want to be put over his knee and punished. Be explicitly clear that you want more spanking, sometimes in relationships it takes a few times before it sinks in. So be very adamant about how much you want it and enjoy it.... or call me.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Well with his hand he can't hurt you.  With belts whips and paddles he can if he hits your tail bone.  You tell him to spank you as hard as he can and you will tell him if it hurts and you won't be mad if its more than you can handle.  <br>  I am a spanker I actually have a huge list of women and YES men too who ask me to spank them.  Usually they have a story to tell why they deserve one and I decide how much how long and how hard.  These people understand they have no option to ask me to stop.  I stop when I think they got what they deserved.  <br>  Yes its hard to find a person who is not afraid to wail on the backside but were out there.|`|PuV9lh37aa	Don't hurt him|`|JbKerMCkaa	I would talk with him about how it makes you feel when you get spanked, and how its so pleasurable.  <br>  <br>  I am very gentle and always very respectful of women, but if I knew you liked to be spanked hard I would be so aroused to force you over my knee, pull your pants down and spank you...HARD  (oh I need to stop typing now *wink* I am getting a little excited)<br>  <br>  Just talked with him :->  You could always use a codeword like "Grandma" or something to get him to stop ha ha|`|aViAFuCEaa	SHOW HIM UR PUM PUM<br>  <br>  FREE MOVIE DOWNLOAD FOR YOU COMPUTER AND MP4 PLAYERS<br>  <br>  <a href="http://vidpoint.webs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://vidpoint.webs.com/</a><br>  <br>  Free movies download for your Ipod and PSP and other MP4 players.

Why the hell do you want him 2 spank you?
uYkqXWN4aa	Sounds like you really need to be patient, as it seems that only circumstance keeps you two apart.. Keep the communication open and flowing, and you'll have something to look forward to when he's able to return..
AMTYPir7aa	don't try too hard. in order to attract a good man you must be comfortable in your own skin and where you are in your life. that is one of the most important things in attracting others. you cannot know what a person is like (caring, sweet, protective etc) until you get to know them a bit you wont know on the first meeting nor the second it takes a few dates to start to learn what kind of a person you are dealing with.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	you just need to find lads that are like you. lads that have things in common with you; and lads that share interests the same as you do. if a lad likes you they will take an interest in you and start talking to you a lot more - and then you automatically just start talking a lot, and it spirals from there. it doesn't matter that you are shy; but maybe just try and think of ways of being more confident around lads that you do not know - and you will start to meet more people that way. if you're too shy and won't really talk; automatically they will think you aren't interested and just go and bother with someone else :)|`|n0bFInLmaa	agreed.  why the rush? he'll eventually show up when u stop looking :)|`|hHndD5SEaa	stop looking for starters!!!! It sounds like thats all you're focused on - is finding a guy!! just be yourself for a while - forget about the guys and concentrate on YOU! <br>  Its usually when you stop looking that love finds you!<br>  xx|`|aaoWVDxMaa	Don't look for a boyfriend.

But given some factors you left out, such as age, interests and dislikes, the type and amount of advice is limited only to what you "have" revealed. "Shyness" is/was something I've struggled with all of my life and for it I do know one thing is for sure, "shyness" will eliminate a necessary "openness" that's needed to let the others know you even exist. Shyness is a type of fear and cautiousness, that most definitely has its place. But one place it is NOT needed is when it comes to letting others know what you have to offer being the awesome person I believe you are. Being more open should greatly increase your choices.           TT|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Well guys aren't exactly known for their perceptiveness. Sometimes you gotta go up and introduce yourself. You seem to know what you want and that is a good thing. Let me tell you though when I see a shy girl summon the panache to come up to me and talk well that wins major points with me. Trust me sometimes you just gotta go for it.|`|cEZYs5eJaa	Now listen here PLEASE don't tell anyone!<br>  its personal...<br>  well i'm only 8 and i've got married!<br>  well not exactly...<br>  He's a kid from london and his mother is my godmother!<br>  good luck in finding a nice one!<br>  so go to london!<br>  they have good ones...<br>  I hope this helps you!<br>  P.S do you know anywhere to get a wii?<br>  I've been to GAME though|`|Ef5YC9Z7aa	find a fat guy, and he'll most probably be sweet, caring etc.. due to a lack of women in his life, then motivate him to lose weight, and hit weights at the gym, and sooner or later he'll be good looking too, and ther you go ;)|`|Iw4Ed5Ueaa	Go on an on-line dating site or just weight until he come to you. <br>  When he does be your self and take things slowly.|`|sZ1vyyiQaa	Just keep being yourself and the right one will come|`|5N1rEjiqaa	Look at church|`|5hlJwDBoaa	dont look at a church they are full of crap as well|`|sMfDrCt9aa	Well, the way i did it was.<br>  <br>  Sign up on www.bebo.com<br>  Then you search for like your area or a college near yours or something depending on how old you are.

mJbwemH8aa	Basically there is nothing wrong in knowing some more about someone or somthing, but dont dig into their personal stuff<br>  <br>  <br>  ..|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	hmmm.....good question. I've had women I've JUST met ask me for my last name so they could google me. And, yeah. It made me feel uncomfortable. But, ultimately, I have nothing to hide. I'm honest, and if that's what made them happy....
OyWVqe23aa	girl b.|`|FgxQVeitaa	GIRL B!!!! if your girlfriend thinks that, then that must mean something|`|NXJDsVfNaa	Well...<br>  your girlfriend's friend said that you should go with girl B. <br>  Since she would know what your gf is thinking and saying, I'd say take her advice. You gf might want to break up or something and you are just wasting you time with her. <br>  <br>  Also, if your gf is the sweetest person you know, and you fight all the time..<br>  every think its you?? <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|WY7HJDpgaa	b
VQHUjpICaa	She's either anxious to be talking to you or she's...a little strange.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	Unless she's SO shy that she hangs up because she is rendered completely speechless, then this to me borders on psychotic behavior. <br>  <br>  Next time she does it, answer the text with "I don't know what's good. But, what isn't is you hanging up on me!"

ml2FDYECaa	Deal with it differently. An argument between two people should be about learning something. People forget, and just want to get their own point across. Listen to what she is saying. "I MEAN LISTEN." Then respond. But you have to realize once you yell, or curse you automatically lost the argument. Respect her...it's not too late. Let her know you are having issues with getting angry, so you can be on the same page. Just don't get comfortable with your temper as she will, and it can lead to violence...GL<br>  <br>  Tell her you love her more often that is if you do.|`|tfh2qF6jaa	Well, the reason why your getting more agitated is probably because you guys argue a lot.  To prevent getting angry sometimes  all you have to do is either hold your tongue or give in even if its 110% her fault, but if the aruguing continues, then I think something in the relationship is wrong and maybe you guys should take a break. Good luck =]|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	It's time to evaluate the friendship part of your relationship.<br>  <br>  All healthy romantic relationships are based on a strong friendship that is being cared for by both parties.  If either of you aren't holding up your end, it will falter quickly.<br>  <br>  Be objective, and see how much you are doing to make her life better, and what she is doing for your life.  This includes time spent together, activities, sex, romance, and just basic kindness.  Be real honest with yourself as to how you treat her, and how she treats you.<br>  <br>  You may find that the friendship is either in a sad state, or just dead.  If it is just in the need of a boost, fix it.  If it is dead, it's time to move on.|`|sCCjAKllaa	Suppress your anger by leaving her presence. That'll help you a lot more then standing there waiting for the argument to get more intense.|`|6BcQ438zaa	learn to have patients & be understanding<br>  <br>  you sound like you may be a lil stressed, outside of the relationship<br>  <br>  try to figure out what your main problems are, and you to can resolve them so you guys don't have as many arguments<br>  arguments can really ruin a relationship<br>  <br>  maybe you are spending to much time together?<br>  the less time you spend together, the more valuable the time you do spend together is<br>  <br>  never hit a girl, it's wrong, <br>  that reputation will stay w/you forever, I mean forever<br>  if you have enough self control you won't do it<br>  <br>  just don't give up|`|6qsfdMg1aa	it happens its totally normal you might have some stuff in your life right not that is frustrating you. I think what you can do which is sometimes hard in the heat of an argument but like just slow down your brain and just tell yourself to calm down take a breath or say to her I have to walk out for a second and like chill for 5 mins then explain to her you just wanted to calm down. think about what your arguing about and listen to what she has to say. you just gotta do it! cuz when ppl argue all you hear is yourself talking not your partner!<br>  <br>  Youll be fine!!!|`|tcvQwTa5aa	If you argue with the girl all the time then maybe you two just don't see eye to eye anymore and it's time to break it off or at least take a little vacation from eachother.Or,if you really want to make things work with her you could step back,take a few breaths and let some of the anger pass before you react.If you're quicker to anger than you were then maybe it's just building up and building up.You need to go beat some pillows and scream and let some of it go.Sounds silly but I've heard that it helps.Good luck.|`|AA10266072	I use to just walk away when I knew I was going to get angry.  It was tough at first but i got use to it.
6sTsDvKmaa	Live in the moment.  Don't worry about the future.  <br>  <br>  It will hurt either way when he leaves, but in the future you'll more likely regret what you didn't do, not what you did do.
mJbwemH8aa	yr cute and he looks like a wrestler, lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ...|`|IPS3hWweaa	He does look hella old. And you look hella young.

The few, the proud, the BUTT pirates are lame. ARMY INFANTRY ALL DAY! <br>  <br>  Now to answer your question, it shouldn't matter what people think, it's about how you feel. If you're concerned about how others feel about YOUR relationship, you're either insecure, or the relationship is weak.<br>  I'd also like to point out that he looks like a gorilla. He looks horrible. I'm glad we don't have to have those ugly hair cuts in the Army. I like my hair, and I suggest he tone his muscles a little more.....EW that head is horrid!|`|OyWVqe23aa	damn with a body like that you should ravish him!!! have hardcore sex with him!!|`|PWN5rqgxaa	you wear too much makeup|`|S4VVE0onaa	if your happy with him that is all that matters|`|RyYV3aXlaa	I don't see the problem
Xu71saGaaa	Shoot him a message on FB.. see what he says.
RvddYKqjaa	I think that if you care about yourself, you will not just get used to him making comments about other women. He is rude. When he's with you, if he's more concerned about other women, let him have them. I wouldn't be jealous. I just wouldn't tolerate it. Comparisons that make you feel less than you are, are just unnecessary and uncomplimentary.|`|AMTYPir7aa	it depends is he commenting about this hot woman to his friends or to you. i mean of course guys are going to say that to each other when they see a good looking woman and they will think it when around you. only a dumb *** would mention that he thinks another woman is hot in front of his girlfriend he needs to keep that **** in his head.|`|uBssj3Znaa	it depends on what he is commenting on and how he says it. <br>  <br>  Probably it is something you need to let go. Jealousy is unhealthy and will destroy a relationship quicker than anything.
PWN5rqgxaa	be genuine and real... let people know whats inside you... what you think feel dream about etc...  its called inner beauty and everybody has it|`|JCdBSULraa	There is NOTHING that can make up for being overweight for every guy.   Fortunately, everyone can lose weight.   It just takes time and discipline.  The idea that "looks matter more to guys" is only a half-truth.  Slenderness matters to us, yes, but we don't pay that much attention to the rest.<br>  <br>  I will say that I'm willing to date overweight people who are very much like me - into the same video games, have the same religious and political views, etc, but attraction is still very difficult.|`|LeIS45Ekaa	well i have noticed from experience that guys love to see your face so pull your hair back make sure you put foundation on any acne or blemishes i us a lot of eye liner because i have really nice as or as every one says you don't want to cover up your Natural beauty you want to Enhance it.|`|QaOj0nQLaa	Be sweet, caring and loving. Be outgoing, be something someone would want to have in their life and of course, be yourself, duh :)|`|oSkcbg0Uaa	Personality is a huge role. Be really sweet and kind. Have manners and good personal hygiene. Looks isn't everything! I hope I helped :]|`|AA10873763	Start with the realization that "attractive" doesn't mean physical beauty.<br>  What you mean are ways to be attractive despite physical appearance.  <br>  Confidence, sense of humor, and an easy-going (undemanding) nature seem to be key ingredients, judging from my guy friends and their "less than beautiful" girlfriends.|`|GhETSRdUaa	Just take good care of yourself, and be confident. Believe that you're pretty, you know? Just be funny, be cute, be yourself.-
mJbwemH8aa	Stop thinking of them both and go out know someone better than both, u deserve that.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ...|`|5aXKo6uCaa	is this a poem?|`|k1AZtmM1aa	It sounds like you fell in love with their looks.The first guy sounds like a jerk.It does'nt really sound like you like them.<br>  Love does'nt always come with feeling,it's when you would do anything to make them happy and want the best for them.you would'nt care what they looked like,and you would give your life for them anyday.
S4VVE0onaa	no i think she is giving the hint for you to ask her out|`|9QZ9Ie1Jaa	you will never know until you ask her out <br>  just doooo ittttttt!|`|06ed225c555fb7afe18161cf019ce5ffaa	You should try and notice how she interacts with her other guy friends. If what you described is similar to how she interacts with other guys that you know she only sees as friends then your answer would be no. If its the opposite and its only you she acts that way with then the answer would be yes.
62gMbgb1aa	i think you are either not sure if you love him, or not sure if you want to break up. How can you love him (i mean being in love with him) and the only thing that you think about when talking about breaking up is not hurting him, you are talking as if you dont love him,. so please decide, and in case you do love him, why you wanna break up!!|`|v96pYAg1aa	Do u really want to know that?...there is only one answer and the answer is there is no answer it will always hurt there is no way to not hurt the person u love its all about choice in words or confuse him that works at times to the point where they dont care but the truth is u want him to care as much as u dont want to hurt him|`|rjeiGam7aa	There is no way, love doesn't work that way.
8mR3Kchnaa	Tohelp them out and give them a better life..its our duty as humans to help our fellow bros and sisters.....
WY7HJDpgaa	yes - u have a crush on the two of them at the same time??
mJbwemH8aa	Because the moment u think about him and what u have done u will feel bad, so u dont let yrself<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ...|`|QaOj0nQLaa	Because youn don't really care about how them and how they feel. (Reason for cheating) - My guess
7o3DMzXQaa	call her once you have calmed down, ha... really there's no rule, but if you want to give her options don't call her an hour before you go out to see if she wants to go, plan something|`|oA8fEliTaa	LUCKY YOU HA WELL I THINK YOU SHOULD CALL HER NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hit her up this weekend to see if she wants to meet for drinks or coffee or something.|`|AH3wnGbcaa	hey heyy your about to get yourself a girlfriend! ;) <br>  haha jk, ok dont call her to late either, so you should call her...4 days after. so lets just say she gave the # to u yesterday. then you should call her on sunday! and since its the weekend you should ask her to lunch or coffe or something.<br>  <br>  good luck buddy!

But its really when you think its right because to some people that can be a scary thing.
twVyisGnaa	Because they're so damn beautiful.  Plus, they have the wonderful features of the countries of origin they are mixed with.  I don't know, it's hard to explain, and I'm a dude.

62o2OdSIaa	The first thing i look for in a guy is an automatic first connection and a great personality. I look for someone who has some of the same qualities in me you know like trust, honesty, someone you can be yourself around. If i feel weird around them, then i know that their not for me. I like a boy who can be himself around me too as well as iam around him and a boy who doesnt take you for granted or use you. If you cant trust him and if he is not honest with you then theres no point in dating him. Another plus i look for is that they can show you off in front of their friends.... another words... their not scared or embarrased to be seen with you  by their friends. The perfect boyfriend to me is all that plus supporting you for whatever you are going after and just overall... making an effort.... a fun boy who yes, is fun and also has a soft and serious side!  =) hope this answers your question!|`|Pe1gHUMbaa	Lisa:17<br>  <br>  The first thing I look for in a good is a good personality. If I get a weird vibe off him, its not going to work. There has to be some type of physical attraction of course so a nice smile and pretty eyes are a big plus. I look for an athlete kind of guy because I'm very athlete. My boyfriend right now is a totally gentlemen but has a mind of his own. I'll drop a guy if he becomes whipped and can't think for himself. I like a guy that acts like a guy but has a soft side too. Hopefully that's enough to answer your question. :)|`|pVOG0yAYaa	I guess you wont get many answers though. <br>  Girls this age group have a lot of other things to do on a friday night !!! <br>  lol !!<br>  <br>   I am just killing my time waiting for my date to show up ;)|`|LJkw276Laa	skater and tight pants and nice bootyy and cute teeth and amazing hairr|`|BgzVBclBaa	1 that loves me and i can be myself around and whoz fun (very very very important) .|`|Xd0jFZhDaa	If you want me to be honest, then so be it.<br>  at this age, I don't even look for boyfriends because you have to date someone in the same age group.<br>  And since I matured really quickly, Boyfriends of this age aren't very appealing because they are all so immature and childish.<br>  Personally, I'm into older guys and serious relationships so I'm gonna wait for some time.
AjPbtm7oaa	A big dick & a bigger wallet.|`|Ev4kifIOaa	lol you dont pick them up they pick you up.<br>  <br>  besides the hottest chicks are the ones with the most problems so i would steer clear from them. i know i wouldnt want everyguy in the world trying to hit on my girl. lol id rather be safe with average and cute

It's true there will always be liars out there, but there are plenty of attached guys who will tell you straight out!|`|PWN5rqgxaa	stop looking for guys in bars because thats the kind of guys youll wind up with... go to church|`|TBZK5q78aa	Maye you are attracted to well established men...

Focus on you career and out of the blue God will bless you with the man of your dreams! God is epic!|`|JCdBSULraa	You sound interesting, shoot me an email.
IPS3hWweaa	Don't worry too much about it just yet. Give yourself some time and just try to do what you can to attract a boy's attention, but don't overdo it because the boy will think you're annoying, and you don't want that.<br>  <br>  Having red curly hair is not something to worry about, the boys your age are just barely starting to notice girls, so take your time and don't rush into something.|`|I40iBJdHaa	awww, sweety! don't worry. it'll happen when it happens.|`|2f7MEQMiaa	Girl, your only 14- hold your horses! <br>  Guys will come.

VV7bpOXuaa	Yes ask her out!<br>  She is obviously just playing hard to get ;)<br>  That is just some girls way of flirting, by pretending they don't like you. But really, they want all of the attention from you. So it is a high chance that really she does like you. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!

e2HW9iQ5aa	"and i know guys dont like girls that they know are into them ... "<br>  <br>  You're misinformed.  You think guys like women that are NOT into them?? Any guy worth their salt is going to like a woman that is honest and straight forward. Don't profess your undying love and scare the guy off, but tell him you like him, would like to talk with him more and maybe see if there's "something there", and ask if he feels the same way.<br>  For all you know, he could really like you, and is distressed that YOU are not showing more interest. Only one way to find out...|`|6sTsDvKmaa	The fact that guys don't like mystery and don't like girls that are into them is a stereotype, and not all guys are this way.  If he has any interest in you, then he will be really happy that you like him back.  <br>  <br>  As for the mystery, if the friend already told him that you like him, then he already knows, so why not pursue it and see what happens?  Maybe find some kind of common interest through facebook and meet him in person.  Or hang out with him and the mutual friend so it'll be less awkward at first.|`|AA10586456	instead of facebook why dont  you just try and give a call or tell him to hang out with you.....|`|Cx2XfDiIaa	what you need to do is to talk to him he might like you

Sorry, but she sounds very shallow and you don't need her or people like her in your life.|`|Zm3QIw4Taa	just dont be too obsessive. like play hard to get. let her text you first. for some reason us girls like what we cant have. so in my opinion be super sweet but dont always nag her about hanging out. then if it doesnt work talk to her about it and say you know we cant have a relation like this and then move on... shell see whats happening and come back to ya... trust me!|`|IWO1GTpGaa	First you have to calm down and stop thinking so hard.  Then, yes you need to play hard to get just a tad.  This is a stage where in the relationship you have to play a game.  The game could be metaphoric as chess or checkers.  Think, if you all of a sudden stop messenger so often and asking her out so much she will begin to think why? Stop being so persistent and craved because you are the one looking like the DA.  Do not try so hard to please her because she is playing the game with you and as of now you are losing.  Become more laid back and start making plans with someone else (boys) maybe a girl.

Can you two afford daycare? If you two can't afford daycare, will one of you have to quit their job to raise these babies? Can only one of you work and still pay your bills and take care of these babies without living off the government or the grandparents? If either one of you was in school are you dropping out? The list of questions can go on. If you answer them honestly you will have your answer. And if you have to live off te government to raise them, give them up for adoption for a better life.|`|nWUJgykxaa	well it depends.  I was 19 when i got married (he was 21), its 14 1/2 years later and we are still happily married.  The only difference is, I wasn't pregnant when we got married; we had our first child after 3 years of marriage.

AA11263103	here follow these steps!!!!!!!!<br>  French Kissing tips<br>  <br>  This is a guide to basic kissing, i.e. you learn the basics and get the basics right, then experiment and try different styles and more advanced techniques. <br>  <br>  The basics <br>  <br>  1. Brush your teeth, get a good bath, nicely groomed and clean and fresh, before meeting the other person. There's nothing worse than kissing the rear end of a garbage truck <br>  <br>  2. Get into a comfortable position - you can't kiss if your back feels like it's gonna break. Suggestion - Sit side by side on a comfy sofa. <br>  <br>  3. Hold your lover , firmly but gently - don't cause pain. Suggestion would be to hold the shoulders, the neck or gently on the side of the face, one side or both sides. <br>  <br>  4. Move your faces closer. Don't bump noses. Suggestion would be the guy angle his face slightly so you don't bump noses. <br>  <br>  5. Kiss gently, normal closed lips kissing, and close your eyes. Closing your eyes increases the sensations you feel, and also sets the mood. <br>  <br>  6. Continue kissing gently. Get comfortable with simple closed lips, lip-to-lip kissing before going anywhere else. <br>  <br>  7. If fine till here, tentatively, slowly and lightly draw your tongue across the other person's lips. <br>  <br>  8. Chances are from here, if the other person lightly parts her tongue, slowly explore the other person's tongue in a light licking motion. <br>  <br>  9. The tongue has a very sensitive surface, which is why tongue to tongue is the essence of french kissing. <br>  <br>  10. After you've tried lightly licking the other person's tongue, you can try sucking on it, wrestling with it ( see if you can hold it to the floor of her mouth ) and other things like that. <br>  <br>  11. Explore the other areas of the mouth. Especially the roof of the mouth. Lightly lick, or tickle the area with your tongue. <br>  <br>  12. Don't bite. whatever you do, don't bite. <br>  <br>  13. Don't swing your tongue round and round like a windmill. Explore lightly, don't drill your way through. <br>  <br>  14. Breathe through your nose. Breathe through your nose. I say again, breathe through your nose. <br>  <br>  15. Follow so far? You can lightly use your hands too, lightly rubbing the other person. Suggestions, along the waist, along the back, the arms, especially the inside of the arm, the neck, maybe running your fingers through her hair. Again, don't cause pain. <br>  <br>  16. Continue kissing.|`|AA10447831	let him Fr kiss you first then do what he does. Only follow him if he doesn't jam his whole tongue down your throat tho'|`|i5tbDTcQaa	i think french kissing is slightly over rated, its basically what everybody calls a "pull"<br>  "Kissing with your mouth open"<br>  <br>  The guy would usually lead you anyway, starting off with a kiss on the lips, and then gently opening his mouth, you just go with it, who ever told you that you didnt do it right is an idiot, you can't do it wrong <br>  hope this helps xx|`|HRT37fkFaa	first of all make sure the mood is right,<br>  the lights arent to bright but not in complete darkness, yet<br>  make sure you have nothing in your mouth<br>  and dont use gum, cos it makes your breath worse<br>  use mints ;)<br>  look deep into his eyes<br>  like yur getting him hypnotised<br>  lean in slightly tilting your head to one side, makeing sure he goes the other way or you cud be in for a collision!<br>  lean in<br>  dont use too much tounge or slobber<br>  jus go with what you instincts tell you ]<br>  you will be fine (:<br>  good luck<br>  oh and dont bit<br>  and then smile at the end <br>  <br>  xx|`|wilZqg7Laa	French Kiss is the most popular type of kiss.

R1ecMOO8aa	ok.  she likes your behaviour.  good luck.
0nW8wMBdaa	The problem could be that she is probably sexually inexperienced/shy and probably thinks once you sleep with her you'll get bored and dump her. The other reason is that she's interested in someone else and is keeping her options open

SyTM5anVaa	YES.
I40iBJdHaa	you sound like a decent guy, but your views on women aren't too great. we're not all sl*ts. and how do women insult you? you didn't mention anything about that. you can't really think that all women are going to spend your money and then cheat on you, i mean come on. there are many independent girls who make their own money, and don't have a need to spend their boyfriend's money, like me.<br>  basically, girls are looking for excitement. not to be mean, but you don't sound very exciting! <br>  <br>  "woman waste you money"<br>  with that kind of attitude, you're gonna be alone for quite some time.|`|o1rzGR8kaa	You sound like you need special bus|`|8MpnQSe0aa	what kind of insult are you talking about?|`|S4VVE0onaa	i think its decent folk like you that are insulting women by calling them sl*ts|`|oyi2Fw5Waa	It's not out of common what you're feeling. You're right. Nowadays it happens that dating gets another meaning, for some of the people it's only for fun, or to have somebody. I detest these ones. Like you (only that I'm a girl), I never had a boyfriend, but I'm okay with it. I have more important things to do,like studying, finishing school etc. When my time will come, then I'll face that too xD How to say... to have a girlfriend it's not as important as your future is. So, go on with your studies or whatever you're up to. You will find a decent one.<br>  Oh, and I like classical music too. I'm playing classical music. And I think it's ridiculous from somebody to say to a boy,who likes classical music that he's "gay". Well, it tells a lot about that person. And I'm not saying this,because I like classical music. It's just the matter to accept the other, even if there's a difference between tastes.
7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	She's decided you are a friend.  You will never change that view without some super heroic event that you can't plan to happen.<br>  <br>  Once you get the friend label, you aren't going to find her wanting to date you.  She doesn't see you as a potential mate/partner.  It's just the way women think.<br>  <br>  Write her off as anything but a friend, and move on.  The only way she may see things differently is if you stop being there for her all the time, being an emotional crutch for her.  If that absence makes her upset, you may have a small chance.  Doubtful, but small.|`|RGxqhxDdaa	Perhaps you can still find a way to her. It is a good sign that she said you are special in general, that has got to mean something... maybe it's a cruel test she's putting you through. I know that if you were to show affection to another girl around her and that other girl flirts back, then she may get jealous and will try to get closer with you in response. Try that out. Also, use your mind to find ways to get with her|`|4RiziMD0aa	The same thing happened to me and i'm still friends with him. IT still hurts but everyday i feel better. i think the only thing that can really heal is time becuase there is this other guy who is interested in me but i just can't see myself dating him. We can't help who we like. and we just have to try everyday to feel better. time heals tho and my feelings for my crush are slowly dissolving. hope you feel better :)|`|aKvxy3xBaa	If shes not interested in you, then move on and find some one who is.|`|Y8IgaNp5aa	Have FUN!<br>  go have the time of your life and forget her.<br>  I mean don't forget her but at least keep her off ur mind for a while.<br>  You'll prob find some other girl who loves u and is better than the one u liked.|`|T2o9ptUlaa	You need to give it time. It will hurt for a long time, and you might not ever forget her, but you have to accept the facts.<br>  <br>  Feel better bb. xxo|`|sZ1vyyiQaa	Date other girls to make her jealous|`|KZGGPMTuaa	forget her|`|5aXKo6uCaa	she will come around|`|ABWQgoDtaa	get a new crush|`|0F8hauikaa	Just act like it doesn't bother you, and eventually, it won't. Live and learn, you can't always get what you want.|`|RvddYKqjaa	There may not be better girls out there, because there is nothing wrong with the one who rejected you. There will be other girls though. If you see her everyday, be the person you have always been... Friendly. Like you treat everyone else. The heart can take awhile to heal, but it always does. You're doing the best thing you can do by trying to cheer up. Remember only one person has "rejected" you. Most haven't. Don't allow your feelings for that one to overshadow all of the others who think you are a great guy. Don't waste life carrying this burden around.

gXcQa8qLaa	no he is an *** dump his|`|6jXuUCdraa	if hes calling you bad words and verbally abusing you, its time to go. he has no respect for you and his addiction to porn is disgusting. you shouldn't have to watch his porn just because he wants to and he shouldn't be making fun of you and calling you "big" when your probably not. a boyfriend should not purposely try to hurt his girlfriend's feelings.|`|7ba850c5470a8525c6ddc547c80d809aaa	First of all, if a guy is willing to say those things to you just to hurt you, he isn't worth your time.  That isn't even a discussion.  He's a jack-butt.<br>  <br>  As to his watching porn, get over that.  First of all, do you realize that 95% of all porn actresses are really not pretty at all?  Too many have fake boobs, and not pretty faces.  Acne is common from their drug use, and they probably have the conversation skills of a gnat.  And you feel threatened by them?  For a guy, they are the visual equivalent of a bowl of ice cream with lots of sprinkles.  He's looking at fantasy.<br>  <br>  But no matter what he says, he isn't worth your time.  No man that really cares about the woman he is with would say things like that.  He deliberately tries to ruin your self esteem, so you'll think you can't find someone better than him.  Considering how worthless he is, it wouldn't be hard to find better.<br>  <br>  In this case, having more self respect means dumping him.  You'd be better off with a battery operated boyfriend than this loser.|`|9hreptv4aa	u r not being a bad gf he is being a bad bf if he really likes u he would relize how much this hurts and he would stop|`|VFdC2wPlaa	I don't think you should feel bad. It's his fault that you have a lower self esteem, so it's good that he is going to help you not feel so insecure.|`|uTNKfpV6aa	Okay, you two really sound like you have problems. And I'd suggest, for your sake, and your son's I would get out of that relationship. Your boyfriend is mentally abusive to you, saying things, just to hurt your self esteem, so you're think you're worthless, and won't leave him. And the worse part, is by you staying with him, you're allowing him to mentally abuse your son! And take it from my, my stepfather was mentally abusive, it make the child feel like ****. I was told he never wanted me to move in with my mother, and little sisters. He would kick me out all the time, and scream and yell at us. It was bad.<br>  <br>  Also don't feel bad that you talk to your boyfriend and told him how you were feeling. Communication is important in a relationship. But putting a lock on his porn? Seriously. It's not like the b--ches are going to climb out of the television and f--k his brains out! And aveyou ever heard of the internet?? FREE PORN EVERYWHERE!! Seriously, you have major self esteem problems. And only you can deal with that, and it's going to take a long time to do so, not over night, or in a month.|`|9fEeteY0aa	The porn thing...it varies guy to guy. I'm completely happy with my girlfriend. I'm madly in love with her. The sex is amazing! But I still look at porn, since we have odd schedules that keeps one in class while the other is at work, or vice versa. We both look at porn, actually, to satisfy ourselves.<br>  <br>  Now, to move onto the real issue:<br>  <br>  He's an abusive asshole. Kick his *** to the curb.|`|tZkHHy5jaa	Nothing is more important than your health! Nothing. Not even a porn watching, hurtful boyfriend. If he knows this makes you feel bad and doesn't care, then either leave him alone, or get an extra boyfriend to make bf feel bad.

0fVtHNtmaa	Break up with him and start spending more time learning to spell.|`|MRpSUNNhaa	No one deserves a heartbreak.<br>  But its better to do it now than later.<br>  Don't wait if you dont feel yourself around him.|`|JxNDTbS4aa	when someone breaks my heart, the only revenge i can get is if they get their heart broken in the future. when they come crawling back, i say "lol told you to stay but now it's too late"|`|gXcQa8qLaa	only murders and rapists and hilter deserve to have a broken heart don't do it on purpose,break up with him but not just to hurt him
prkyT6l3aa	I am 14 also, and your not moving too fast unless you are feeling uncomfortable, ask her if she feels comfortable and ask yourself if you are. If one is not then just slow it down. Talking will help alot but don't sound like you don't like her just make it sound like you want her to be comfortable.|`|zUetzCFraa	i am 14 tooo and u are jus enjoying the realtionship... btw **** HER ON THE 10TH DATE..  jus don't get her pregnant.. kk trust me 14 year old girls want action after 10 dates.. kk and u aren't going fast its called a REALTIONSHIP WITH A GIRL.. btw are u hot.. u wanna **** me instead and i am fast like u too...|`|9aBKmhbZaa	yeah i think that you do need to slow down for only being 14....it is nice to go on dates but it is better if you go once every 2 weeks or so and you don't want the fun to run out so fast either...|`|0JqF493Vaa	Is it dates or just hanging out??  Either way girls love both.<br>   Also im sure if she had a problem she would speak up..|`|vJGeOvQxaa	that is not too fast or not too slow.<br>  <br>  that is about an average of couple having dates.(who loves each other really much...)<br>  <br>  you guys will be a great couple|`|sooNO69Naa	you guys like spending time together theres nuthing wrong with that thats actually a good thing...<br>  just dont do things you knwo you shouldnt or could jeporadize the fun times ur having.......(like have sex)|`|0NW8qFKTaa	take it slow you have time|`|vHxauOyeaa	95% chance you don't know what love is, just keep doing it, just don't have sex till one of you has a car.<br>  <br>  What? That is what generations have been doing for as long as cars have existed haha... I lost it when I was 17, and I'm well adjusted. <br>  <br>  Just use a condom, don't have sex till you are ready, that is key... and no you are not ready before 16-18 ... nothing will mess your life up like a child or abortion.|`|vwuMTm7Saa	Sounds pretty normal.|`|SZzASlujaa	You're young, you are only going to fast if you're sexually active. Dates are just fine kiddo. Can't have too many. Keep her happy and I hope you guys end up being a success.|`|1WG0iCQWaa	Don't be alone so much.

ml2FDYECaa	Are you crazy? Look back at your question...you are a fool to give him money...even when he throws a fit. Who's the dumb one, you or him? I would actually think this is a joke. On me or you...GLJA|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You're mad allowing yourself to be used in this way, i'd be embarrassed to have such a man.|`|spWtg1Cmaa	Look it don't mind helping my boyfriend out every so often because he does the same for me. I helped pay to get his car fix, last year he payed for my dorm housing. I don't mind because i know he would do the same for me. But your guy is acting like it's your job to take care of him! I would definitely set boundaries. No more buying him cigs or weed or paying his bills. Tell him money is tight for you too. You are not being stingy cause he is not your kid. He can't always get his way.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	what he really wants from you is for you to make him a sandwich...most guys want money until they get a sandwich|`|NxBYuOzbaa	Okay, you might not want to do this because you feel you love him, but LEAVE HIM. He's just using you for your money, your his sugar momma, love. <br>  <br>  LEAVE HIM, LEAVE HIM, LEAVE HIM.<br>  <br>  If you don't think you can leave him, stop paying for all his crap (canabis, cigarettes, bills, gas and everything you buy for him), and chances are, he'll leave you and if he leaves you, he didn't love you. <br>  <br>  You have to fend for yourself, save you money, get your own home, EVERYTHING will be better. Find a guy that is fair and that loves you for YOU not for your money.<br>  <br>  LEAVE HIM, LEAVE HIM, LEAVE HIM!!!|`|uTQCKQQ9aa	MOVE ON he is using you, a real man would never ask you for money in lets you were living together and your money and his was together. But if your own your own and him the same move on. think about it if he is comfortable in asking you for money then why are you not married. you have to take care of yourself right now things are to hard to keep someone else up. and if you don't have the money he should understand that and not have a fit, that's why i think his using you
uBssj3Znaa	he probably thinks that you are blowing him off.|`|RLoilwCNaa	You're way to sensitive. That kind of attitude will drive him away.
uBssj3Znaa	either one of you needs to move or you need to break up. Not living your life at college age is a waste! You are young, go do things, experience life, make some friends and have some fun. After college life starts.

AMTYPir7aa	well perhaps you should have given more time to getting over the ex before you acquired a new girlfriend. whatever you do do not act on those feelings for the ex they will pass sooner or later and you will be glad. i know how you feel i have fell for men who were nuts and it took me awhile to get over it even though i knew leaving them was the best thing for me.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	yeah....you can't control your THOUGHTS. If they come, they come. Acknowledge them, then let them go. As long as you don't ACT on them.|`|30BcAMXYaa	Maybe life with her is too simple maybe you like to spice up your life with fights and stuff LoL this is my first time giving a answer like this LoL.<br>  what i mean is that maybe things are too simple and you don't like them to be simple and perfect...<br>  it's not your Ex That you want. its the simple and perfection that you dont want|`|oB20ZS8Vaa	It's perfectly normal to still be thinking about your ex.

As for NOT knowing the reason... perhaps you really DO know the reason.<br>  <br>  A man who loves you won't mind that you are a virgin and will LET you be til your wedding night... one who does NOT love you will say he does if it gets him in your pants on THAT night.  Follow?  <br>  <br>  It's up to you and only you when you decide to give it away and to whom.  It shouldn't be some sort of contest as to who loses theirs first and I'll share with you something my great-grandmother had shared with me... those in a hurry are sure to have goods for every man in passing.  A man on a conquest for a wife... he'll only want the best for himself and not someone who has allowed herself to be used merely just for pleasure.  Just something to think about.<br>  <br>  I hope your first time is with someone gentle and kind and full of love for you... someone who can see his unborn children in your eyes... someone who desires strongly to live in your heart, always.  He's out there, somewhere.  You'll find him or he'll find you and neither will have expected but you will both know.|`|VnCEjThKaa	I'm 19 almost 20 and the same applies for me. My friends think this one dude likes me but I only consider him as a friend. Perhaps your kind of picky [i know that's my problem], which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you know wat you want. Don't stress over it. I assume there's a larger female population than males anyhow. (If guys hit on girls as much as they do on the internet i doubt you'd have a problem.) My friend is the opposite of me..but a lot of guys she meets from school or through other friends. If you really want to date someone maybe try consulting a friend...i dunno. I wish you the best of luck and its not an abnormal thing.|`|DLAkIHsDaa	Me also man I studied in Sainik school its only for boys so my whole school life went waste.

jzpKHdjsaa	Nope, the flaw is the lie not the photo. If someone does not want to be judged by their appearance that's fine, don't exchange pictures right away. But don't lie about it...
wnXyTiP9aa	Ignore him. See if he really is sorry if he tries hard. But really... this guy will do things like cheat on you if he thinks he will get away with it. The real determining part was that he lied to you for the first hour, that tells a lot about him. He is a liar, and he will cheat when he can.|`|5yINCMjZaa	if your Bf have never done it before, i would forgive him, and if his really sorry i would forgive him, <br>  <br>  But if this friend is a TRUE friend and you trust her i would belive her BUT still forgive the bf and NOT break up.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	sounds like he messed up and got caught, and it worked out well for the both of you. sound to me like he should buy you a new car to show how sorry he really is.|`|WO3dtNB5aa	you just said it yourself. he denied kissing her for over an hour and then admitted to it. that proves that he's a liar. this happened to me before as well, and i know it was terrible trying to decide what to do when you're with someone that long. but the point is, that he kissed and another girl and lied to you about it, so you have no idea what else he's lying to you about.|`|RLoilwCNaa	You're getting flat out played. Once a cheater always a cheater. Don't let him off, or it will happen again.
wnXyTiP9aa	YOU'RE THE GUY! You have to GO TALK TO HER in real life!! If you continue being a wussy talking to her on aim, for sure eventually, she will become interested in guys who are more 'man enough' than you are. Time's a wastin', and it might even be too late, but you better quit your aim thingy and ask her out to a movie.<br>  <br>  DO IT!|`|FgxQVeitaa	You took a really long time. I did that too and now im screwed bcuz the girl i ike i think has a bf. but im trying really  hard to get her back!!! so just go for it|`|WpBiIkh6aa	omg! i think b/c u guys have this 'shy-thing' going on in person, she confused on how outgoing you can be (especially by her being popular), she's probably finding the relationship to be a bit awkward. my advice, she probably really is over you... i encourage if things continue on the way they are you, you should move on too, and she's a flirt, girls like that can only lead to heart-break!|`|789f107bf33cc266890c3cc36a929b8baa	She may be just teasing you.<br>  Don't let your heart get broken over something that was never there.<br>  <br>  BUT, she may have feelings for you. Maybe you should ask her out.

3L68leaHaa	it sounds to me like he's trying to make up reasons to be mad at you, so that he doesn't miss you as much when he goes away.  that is a mean technique & only makes things worse for you.  <br>  let him play those games, and give him his space.  he can leave.  go out with some friends to cool off, and just give him the cold shoulder.  a taste of his own medicine might help.
CYwha8Baaa	I meet my bf from online and we have been together for 2 years and now iam pregnant with a little girl<br>  <br>  I have social anxiety to honestly  just keep searching but dont seem desperate because guys dont like that<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK
xzTIB57eaa	wow. you actually think woman choose to be in abusive relationships. hah are you serious? Some woman are not emotionally strong or have very low self esteem and find it hard to leave such relationships. I can't believe you would use words like "stupid".|`|3e657243a606e14632ec806cc8f3adf1aa	I agree.|`|a6Sok7pmaa	Sorry but have you ever been raped? Have you ever been abused in any way its not that easy when you're in a situation like this and until you know you have no right to say these things.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Like I said, have you ever been abused? No I didnt think so.
wH9EdF7naa	well depends on how many people they slept with themselves, etc, i guess.<br>  <br>  i guess if she asks u cud be honest about it, but if she doesnt ask, dont bring it up. just make sure ur safe and tested for std, and so forth.|`|AA11501437	some women, yes - i think some men have unrealistic expectations of womens pasts also.  Not just with sex...in many aspects.  We expect our partners to be near perfect (or what we think the perfect partner would be) in many ways - even though we ourselves are not.|`|AA11447210	Possibly, which is why such things as past # of partners should never be brought up. Talking about past sexual partners and experiences tends to lead to jealousy and insecurity.<br>  <br>  All one need know is their partner is or is not a virgin...if not, have they been safe, tested for STDs, and are on any form of birth control or will use condoms. Beyond that, it's not a good idea to talk about sexual pasts but in the most general terms.|`|cdy5uIE5aa	Yea they definitely have some unrealistic expectations.  Ideally I think women would rather have the man they marry not have any (or maybe 1 or 2) previous partners.  Which I think is totally unrealistic.  I used to date a very christian girl who wouldn't have sex until marriage, and she couldn't stand it that I had been with women previously.  Needless to say this relationship didn't last long.<br>  <br>  I like to think of it as, if I were going in for surgery, I don't want a doctor with only a few notches on his belt.  I want a surgeon with experience and can handle himself in the operating room, I would want the chief of surgery.  As long as the guy is clean with no diseases I think it would be beneficial for him to have plenty of sexual experience, and of course no kids.<br>  <br>  But with that said, I wouldn't want the woman I marry to have more then 7.  I know it's a double standard but I'm a guy and that's the way it has to be.  Besides, I've done some research on the matter and most polls indicate that most women have less the 5 sexual partners in their lifetime.  I figure 7 is being generous.|`|d8uJaLXYaa	No... most of us just don't want to know about your past sex-toys.<br>  Especially if it was an emotional involvement.<br>  Tends to lead to insecurity, like someone already said on here.<br>  Does depend on the person, though. Personally, I'm quite bad for the insecurity thing, but a lot of women are more relaxed haha.
b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	You're kidding, right?<br>  <br>  Guys don't have to be in love with you to want to cuddle, or kiss, or have foreplay. They don't even have to like you or know you. They want sex. <br>  <br>  He's telling you about having "feelings" so you'll kiss, and cuddle, and foreplay with him. Why? To get to the sex.|`|71EwzPSlaa	just cuz you guys fool around doesnt mean he has to love you....love is something that i think you have to work to ...like you cant just love someone once you have sex....i think there is a lot more that goes into love than just kissing and cuddling and foreplay...|`|ZoajuFv1aa	People will say whatever you want to hear so that they can get some.|`|syKIxX45aa	Red alert, is it not obvious he wants in your pants.  If you don't want this then tell him, No|`|763ce153f7628cfd4764c25b6a7ce844aa	Sex and cuddling is not love. Being in love means you can't see your life without the other person, it's to be completed by your partner. Many people mistake lust for love. When you meet someone it starts as lust most of the time and grows into something more with time. Anyone who tells you they love you after being together for less than a month (minimum) doesn't know what love is. You can really like and lust for someone but until you've been with that person long enough to let the lust fade and really get to know and appreciate them it's not love. I didn't tell my wife I loved her for a long time which bothered her. Then I explained that anyone can say I love you even to a stranger but I won't lie just to please someone. Get to know your partner, see if you work/play good together and if you can handle each others bad habits. If you can then it might turn into love. Remember there are allot of players out there that just want to get into your pants and they'll say I love you to anyone as long as they get layed.Hope this helps.|`|ObZChw3paa	1) A guy wants sex.<br>  2) He may like you but doesn't love you yet.<br>  3) Wanna meet up and have sex?|`|u7o75zipaa	'Cause he could just be in it for the sex....|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	guys have no problem having sex with someone they have no feelings for.<br>  <br>  that's one of the awful differences between male and female biology.  When a woman orgasms, her body releases hormones that cause her to bond with the person who gave her the orgasm.  It doesn't work like that for men.<br>  <br>  So as long as you are aware of the fact that a guy will have sex with you and then go home to a wife or girlfriend (or even a boyfriend) and not give you a second thought, then you can make sure you are highly selective about who you choose to engage in physical play with before you play.
KRJ7h8MYaa	I don't think this has anything to do with you. Of course, we can ask the question of why do you date girls who cheat and "play on" you. What attracted you to this girl in the first place? Where did you meet her? Sometimes, you can just tell if a girl is going to act in a brusque manner only a few minutes into a first conversation...judging character isn't that difficult sometimes.<br>  <br>  The thing with me is that I prefer to be friends with someone for a long time before asking them out on a date. Partially to avoid an occurrence of something like this. If you had been friends for a long time, it would have been much harder for her to end the relationship the way she did. People look at friends in a different way than they look at romantic partners. <br>  <br>  Ironically, I think it's good that the relationship ended so abruptly. You didn't want to be involved with her in the long run, even if you did lose some $$$ by spending on gifts and meals. You could have gotten married to her and 5 minutes after the wedding she would have said, "I'm done with you peace yo." Now ultimately you don't want that do you?<br>  <br>  Ah don't be upset...just learn from your mistakes and move on. She wasn't worth it, be lucky that you don't have to deal with her anymore. As I always say, you are the primary, if not sole, creator of your own happiness. You don't need anyone to do it for you. Good luck!|`|707gOCvbaa	She is a disgusting excuse for being a human being. She was using you and the gifts and paying for everything sealed the deal. Trust me when I say whether it's  man or woman if they are the spawn of satan they will do ya dirty. Not all women are like that and just learn one thing from this. 3 weeks is to soon to lavish a woman with gifts and to get stuck paying for everything. You will move on and find someone that will make your heart flutter and the gal in question will have to answer to karma when she comes a knocking. You'll be okay.|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	no man, your going for the wrong type of girl. You gotta meat a real lady not some hoe|`|8HQLhCI0aa	well..<br>  maybe she is also confused so give her some time and if calls back she did have some type of like for u ..<br>  come on dude your going to turn to a jerk ..<br>  yes i so understand your hurt ..<br>  but its life .. <br>  maybe u'll find someone that will not treat you the way this girl did so ..<br>  so think about it ..=)<br>  best of luck ..<br>  don't give up|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Don't stop being a gentleman. thats just one b!tch. Not all girls are like that. But for her..........did you hear about chris brown did to rihianna??? Well, some girls need a lil some of that. Go get her tiger.
t7jiSmjVaa	I would like to have a fling with my wife's boss. Damn the lady is hot !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|aboQfYqeaa	None, they're all male wh@res.  Great friends and I know most of their families, but they just looove to screw around.  I have never been attracted to those type of guys.
G0mtkuDvaa	he isn't trying to be someone that does that he actually likes you|`|JOQtdp9qaa	He probably likes you and is shy around you. I know that if I was around a girl I liked and she tried getting me to look down her shirt I would turn away too, out of respect and more so because I would be afraid you would catch me looking and get pissed. If you keep harping on guys for being pigs they are afraid you will think of them as one, at least the kind of guys worth getting to know. You should be happy that he isn't one of those *** hole type guys. Seems like he told people he liked you and now that its out in the open he is more in tune with you. Try flirting and see what happens.|`|vEiaoR3Saa	Female I am.|`|5Bp6H9dwaa	He might have just been wondering what your group was talking about, maby he was interested in the subject.

But I would call the clinic and see if you could get in.  go to the same clinic cause the more people you go to the more it will get out.  but i would recommend keeping the baby and if you don't want it put it up for adoption.|`|t5N9QQntaa	you two should learn how to have protected sex, or not have sex at all it ridiculous that this would be your 5th, you two need to grow up. but to answer your question man up and go to the same one if you have had no shame going to their on your 4th then what does number 5 matter?|`|XJSOToRGaa	Try buckling your condom, putz.<br>  <br>  Abortions are not a form of birth control.

ifC1aFHxaa	Don't kill this relationship because you "only" have six-seven more months. Think about it. Most relationships when you're fifteen don't last half that long anyway!<br>  I do agree with you on the not having sex decision - being in a sexual relationship clouds your judgement tremendously and you are awfully young for that. <br>  Go through the experience and enjoy TODAY for today.<br>  Good luck, honey!|`|30BcAMXYaa	2 points?

Dont have regrets but dont have sex out of desperation you wlll only hate yourself,|`|gebIjqnWaa	I fell in love many times before I found the one I married. Your age is a vulnerable time in your life. Don't make a lifetime commitment on just two months of knowing someone. Never sacrifice your virtue on hopes that things will be assured. It seldom happens. True love doesn't die because of distance. If it's real and the same for both of you all, then a way will be found to make it happen. Have a happy life.|`|AA10966794	this is basically the same with me and my girlfriend... it has also been about 2 months for us, i am going to college at the end of the summer, and i like her so much, (of course there is a small possibility that i might stay in town for college) but our relationship is great so i think it will last till then too, and i really don't want to hurt her a lot when it might have to end, but i don't want it to end. You both kinda knew wat you were getting into when u started going out, so in a way i think you both will be ready for it when the time comes, even though it will be really tough no matter how ready u are. Just go with ur heart, u really like him and he really likes u, i think it might be harder to end it earlier seeing as u will still see eachother around whereas when he goes to college you won't so it might be easier to get over him...
rh3RNM5faa	A lot of guys out there never tend to say what's on their mind only due to the fear of rejection. You see if you approach the girl the wrong way its obvious that she will indeed reject you but in order to get a yes response and get her to like you back you need to do it in the right way. Read on to discover some of the most earth shattering ways using which you can tell a girl that you like her and at the same time get her to like you back......<br>  <br>  First just be friends- Now this does not mean you should start hanging around her all the time. This only means that get her to know you a bit and open the doors of communication. You see the major mistake a lot of guys make is that they tend to tell the girl directly that they like her and she often ends up rejecting them right away. You see this is the reason why you must protect yourself first and be friends with her.<br>  <br>  Do things which she would love- Be the man she would love to be with. When you are around her do all possible things that any girl magnet would do and let her notice you a bit. You see often you don't even directly have to tell her, when you do the right things at the right time she would start liking you herself.<br>  <br>  Say it in a way as if you are complimenting her- You see when you do it this way she simply can not refuse the proposal. Tell her that she is a great fun person to be with and you truly enjoy her company and like her a lot. You see you said it and she wouldn't even mind when you say it this way.|`|CYwha8Baaa	YEAH she likes you still, you totally can tell, and also<br>  I think I have answered your question last time<br>  <br>  SHE LIKES YOU DUDE<br>  <br>  so if you like her tell her...<br>  <br>  Obviously she has a crush on you and I CAN TELL BY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING HERE<br>  <br>  GO FOR IT<br>  <br>  YOU KNOW YOU WANT<br>  <br>  lol your cute
8o1ZdCkuaa	There is nothing you can say and the more you try, the farther away you will push him.  In all honesty, you cannot TELL people what or how they should feel and you cannot TELL people the answers.  People need to realize things for themselves in their own time.<br>  <br>  You can tell him how you feel about him but don't get all psycho, needy and clingy because that, is a BIG turn-off to a guy.  <br>  <br>  If I were you I would make yourself less accessible, and leave a little mystery.  Keep him wondering.  That will peak his interest and when he doesn't see that you are all over him every minute of the day then he will start to miss you and perhaps realize for himself that you are the one.<br>  <br>  Remember the old saying . .   "If you love something let it go.  If it comes back to you it was meant to be yours."|`|QHnS31Scaa	dont bug him to much just show him you care but not to much|`|ekrTfdFlaa	surprise him with whatever he likes to do. bring him to the beach or somewhere "romantic" and whisper the sweet nothings in his ear until he just wants to be with you... idk.
AROX6og0aa	I have never ever told a woman "I love you" just to have sex with her.|`|Smv1pNk7aa	Yes, when I say, I love you, I mean it everytime. Now, if I just say, love ya, as a closing in a message then it may just mean I'm being over friendly.|`|BkA6xGXzaa	personally i do ... i mean it from the heart ...<br>  mostly .. and i hate to say this ,, men dont mean it TRULLY ,.. they do .. but not as much as when a girl say it ..|`|kHLwlNA5aa	When I say it I mean it, completely. Never said it unless I meant it.|`|uhZneNORaa	I mean it 100%.|`|hBDwpwvKaa	when i say it i mean it.
QieRAMLkaa	You are NOT wrong and I am so sorry you go through that.  What an awful woman, she really needs to get over herself and perhaps talking to her is the best idea for you both.  Maybe have him tell her that the further she pushes you away, the more likely he is going to reject her  tell him not to yell but to be firm about it because she is so disrespectful.   <br>  Maybe even try to talk to her yourself, take her out to lunch and explain you want to be PART of your fiances family not steal him from his.  That maybe if the two of you got along better you would love to have weekly dinners or something where you can try to include her in the relationship.  Its hard for mothers to think that they are losing their children.<br>  <br>  I to have a severe food allergy to Lemons and Limes.  My mother in law  is so sweet about it, IF she makes any food with lemon sauce or anything of the sort she actually lables it AND makes me an alternative meal just for me and my hubby to be so we can enjoy dinner with them....she has also done away with lemon flavored iced tea and Sprite even though I have told her I don't mind drinking water, she told me that it wasn't fair to me  so now she only buys peach iced tea and coke.<br>  <br>  I get on so well with my mother in law, sometimes I hang out with her for hours and my fiance is getting mad at his mom for taking me away from him! lol|`|bmP4NdKuaa	She's being a big huge spoiled brat baby. She's not being deprived of his company. She's not being deprived of anything. He's still going to be there, just not for dinner. Somebody needs to stand up to her, and that someone is her son.|`|EFYkci30aa	No, you're not wrong.  It's just a difficult, odd, situation that is awkward to deal with.  I have a similar problem with my MIL.  I'm a vegetarian and she can't go 30 seconds without eating a piece of meat.  She just doesn't get it.  In YOUR case however, it IS life or death that she gets it.  And either she's going to be a good person and go out of her way to make sure the foods she makes are safe, or she's going to be thoughtless (which she's chosen to do and makes her the bad person, NOT you).  In her defense (well, kinda), it can be very difficult to cook for others with different food habits/allergies/lifestyles than your own.  Maybe you could offer to cook a couple of dishes that are safe for you that everyone can eat.  Bottom line, you're right, she's wrong (and ignorant).  Try to blow it off and not worry about it.|`|gSBco9oaaa	If you were a brittle diabetic, and she cooked with sugar...<br>  No, you are not in the wrong. She is. She is using this as an excuse and as a means to affect your relationship.<br>  <br>  As hard as it may be, your fiance will simply have to explain to his mother that she is his past, you are his future. He has to make it very clear that your life is more important to him than a family dinner at her house. <br>  <br>  Why don't you offer to have them over for dinner? YOU cook, and control everything you eat. Ask them to bring the cards and the wine.|`|s7seaaPkaa	your fiance needs to put her in her place.<br>  me and my husband dont talk to his parents AT ALL.<br>  because they think i stole him away.<br>  and blah blah.<br>  so they treat like im crap.<br>  so i choose not to have any relationship with them at all.<br>  and so does my husband. he will always no matter what be on my side.<br>  and i love him for that.|`|Ww7CyyALaa	upset because "you are taking her son" and she just needs to get over it<br>  <br>  If he really wanted to go eat with his family he would have but he wants to make sure your safe|`|QJslTCUBaa	Your future MIL sounds like a really mean and jealous person. You don't owe her an apology, she should apologized to you.|`|7NqIVXIlaa	No you are not in the wrong. I mean if you just didn't wont to go then i could understand her begging mad. But you have a food allergies that she doesn't seem to understand. If she wanted her son and you to be there then she could respect you allergy and not cook with any nut products plain and simple. Go and play cards but in less she learns to cook food where it wont kill you then stick to your guns and not go over.|`|Drw4Gg1Daa	That's just ridiculous of your mother-in-law.  Rather than blame you, she should be on the phone double-checking all of her ingredients so that you and your fiance can eat with them.  Especially since you've given her at least 8 chances!  I also have nut allergies in addition to many other allergies (eggs, raw fruits and vegetables), and my fiance's mother always calls to make sure I can eat what she is making.  Maybe you should bring your own food to eat, so at least you can eat WITH them...one of my friend's who has celiac's disease does this (allergic to wheat, gluten) everywhere she goes.|`|FaFJoWGyaa	No, you are not in the wrong.  I also have food allergies - to shrimp, but my mother-in-law is luckily for me, very sweet.  If I were you, I would go with your fiance to the dinner, but why not bring your own food?  Maybe pick something up from a favorite take-out place and reiterate your problem.  This isn't just any allergy, this is serious and life threatening...  Take control of what you eat and if she is like you say she is - then I wouldn't take any chances eating her food!|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	I understand why you feel guilty and I think that it is honorable that you are still trying to compromise and let your fiance have time with his family even though it is apparent they don't approve. That said, I think that maybe you should think of a way to compromise. When they invite you over for dinner, make your own dinner and bring it in a tupperware. Warm it up when you get there and eat your own meal, that way no one can try to kill you lol. I know it sounds a little ridiculous, but I can't see any other way. The other option is to have dinner at your own house and you cook the meal. Then you have control of what goes into what. <br>  <br>  For his mom to have tried to kill you eight times now, I would be pretty p***ed off. This is no longer an accident but it's starting to sound intentional. Hope this was a little helpful|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	It sounds like she is the usual mother that can't cut the cord and let him be a man.  That being said your fiance needs to step up like a man and defend you.  It sounds like he is just trying to play the neutral role and keep the peace.  This will never work and things will only get worse.  She will never stop acting like a little baby as long as she knows she can get away with it.  You are a package deal and if she wants a relationship with him then that includes you.  He needs to be a man, and no you are not wrong here at all.  Don't blame yourself.|`|gtunOva2aa	You are definitely not wrong, Your life is more important than your in law's feelings. What you could do is offer to bring a dish from home (that you know would be safe) and eat that for dinner. Your mother in law sounds very stubborn and immature, and it sounds to me like she needs to grow up a bit. Children grow up and get married and move out. Big whoop. Has your fiancee talked to her about it?|`|xNylDuEuaa	I think if you have already explained to yout MIL that you are dangerously allergic to nuts, she should not be making a nut filled recipe if she has invited you. I think its insensitive or rude on her part not on yours.<br>  <br>  You should explain to her that u can only have her food if she avoids nuts.Otherwise just dont go.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could send your fiance there and abstain from physical contact with him for a couple of days.|`|FXeuwkX0aa	Your fiance needs to stand up and tell his parents straight up that unless they can be sensitive to your problem the both of you will not be there until after dinner. Thats that!|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	you are not wrong and if she wants to spend time with any grandchildren she'd better learn how to cook or she could risk killing them as allergies can be hereditary.<br>  <br>  you've got a great guy who stands up to her for you.  You're just going to have to look at her as a nut (in more ways than one) and modify your life so that you don't have an allergic reaction to her.
LVlS4y7Caa	It really doesn't matter whether you're married right now or not, the intention is TO marry and soon you will be...Your motherinlaw is a walking nightmare and it does sound like your fiance already "gets" that about his Mom and you...This isn't really about the peanut allergy dear, its about YOU and your motherinlaw to be is already being a "monster motherinlaw" clearly.<br>  <br>  The game plan should be not to eat there if you can't TRUST her NOT to cook with any peanut product <pathetic>  The other part of your future?  LIMIT your time/interaction with the woman - BOTH you and your husband.  Make sure you discuss this before holiday season(s) so you aren't locked into them with her continually.  Moderate all time spent as a couple with them...This is all you can do in forecasting and watching out for her animosities that will continue, until she gets the message:  a)  you two are a COUPLE   b) marrying <hopefully> for LIFE  c) you're NOT going away!   d)  IF you have children, you may very will limit THEIR interaction with her, and unless your relationship improves dramatically?  I certainly wouldn't leave an infant/grandchild in her care...That's the way it goes...This is your reality check.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|eoQoCcz5aa	Myself one would get a dog turd wrap it up next time this old boiler of a future mother in law tries to give you something to eat that may kill you tell her you will eat her food if she would eat the dog turd . That should put an end to this problem . many thanks , cheerio .|`|m81dfyOYaa	Take your own food, a small pizza or a salad, etc. that's not hard to do. It's not a good idea to have your bf and his mother arguing over this, it will lead to bigger and more problems once you are married.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	No pun intended, but this is nuts!  Staying away from these foods is a must.  This is just another reason for your mom in-law to-be to dilike you.  She is being very rude, insensitive and out of line.  How are you taking her son away?  Even if things didn't work out with you two, would she ever be happy with anyone for her son?  Does she expect him to single his whole life?  What happened to a Mom wanted her son to be happy?  What a very  selfish woman.  <br>  <br>  You said that his mom asked him to reconsider and think about what he is giving up.  What is he giving up?  A meal ?  I do believe family dinners are important and you can't avoid them.  <br>  <br>  Have you ever thought about bringing your own meal?  Prepare a plate for yourself and bring it with you.  Your fiance can enjoy the family meal that mommy cooked, you have your own.  No biggie.  How long does he have to wait after eating nuts before he can kiss you?  You might just have to hold off kissing during these times.<br>  <br>  What  are the chances of passing this allergy down to your future children?  If you can, I'm sure she loves that too.    <br>  <br>  I know this is different, but many members of my family are vegetarians.  At family dinners, we have lots of veggies and some protein other than meat.  We make sure their are no animal by-products used in the preparation.  This woman has to come to terms that you are part of the family now.  What a witch!  Good luck.|`|7edl5u1oaa	Wow, you have a solid reason to not want to eat at her house. It's your life on the line for goodness sake and she needs to understand that. I have to definitely applaud your fiance b/c that's wonderful of him to look out for you. <br>  <br>  Maybe you can bring your meals to her house or just eat elsewhere and then go. Either way when she sees that you or your fiance won't bulge and she really wants him over for dinner, she will start cooking more allergy-friendly meals. She's just acting out because-as you say-her son is leaving her!!!|`|goY0JHzlaa	She sounds like a nut job. Nut allergies can be life threatening. I wonder how she would feel if you ended up in the hospital or worse because of her stubborn stupidity. I wouldn't worry about her. Just keep the open communication going with the sweetie. Let him deal with mommy. It's his problem, not yours.|`|AA11506593	Wow! If you do get married, be prepared for a BUMPY ride. Your future MIL is not going to make your life enjoyable.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, your fiance sounds like a keeper. He has his priorities right -- YOU!|`|AA11646252	no you are not wrong and the future mil has problems and will always be this way so do not expect her to change and be prepared for how your husband will put up with this.<br>  <br>  rd|`|7eaf5c689c77b9c042b4be96ab16b8abaa	Your fiance is doing well, but could be doing better.  He needs to sit mommy down and let her know it is not what he is giving up.  If she cannot accept you, then she is giving him up.<br>  <br>  That cannot come from you, that must come from him.  If you say it then you are just the evil daughter-in-law.<br>  <br>  He has to man up and put mommy in her place.<br>  <br>  (I did the same, only it was my dad who didn't like my wife.  Time changes things and he realizes how good she is. )|`|ze7xiJwTaa	If you can be 'near' food with nuts then I would recommend bringing your own food and joining them for dinner. If not, she's going to have to understand. It doesn't matter if you are married yet or not. <br>  She sounds very controlling and not very understanding. I'm sorry that you are going to have to deal with her if you spend your life with this man. But take the high road.

She probably has no idea that you could actually DIE from a severe allergic reaction.  Her son needs to sit down and talk to her in detail about this specific issue.   She really cannot expect you to literally put your life in danger, she needs to consider your allergies when cooking.   On the flip side, I am quite sure that each day you may come into contact with nuts here and there and you need to be prepared.   Carry an epipen with you if you dont already, it could save your life one day

Yes, they will be given their meds again, but, they will be punished just the same.<br>  <br>  In the case of Pilcox, they guy knew what he was doing, what he wanted to do and why.

But i think the question you should be asking is, if your ex is ready to jump into a new relationship, obviously he hasn't moved on from his ex yet, otherwise the photo's etc wouldn't still be all over the place, people take those down & if he's telling you it's because they're still friends, or he likes them, or whatever... its just because he still hasn't dealt with the breakup. But to your question, jealousy is total normal, just don't let it rule your life & your relationship, try talking to him, he should be making you feel secure & comfortable that he's over her, so that your jealous ceases to exist.|`|EqG8KMQOaa	Extremely normal. Baby girl, don't be in a relationship where this fool has NOT let go of his ex. You're the one getting hurt in the end. If he doesn't know that he's lucky to have you, then drop him. Why does he need to keep the memories of his ex? Because he has yet to let go. Just be straight up with him, you or her. Obviously she doesn't want him for a reason, so maybe it'll be good for you to find a guy without all the baggage. Good luck!|`|5e14c31a3045fe59c0b780a5ca6b7a9daa	ABSOLUTELY! if he still has pictures of her all over the place then i don't think he is over her yet...<br>  i would be concerned about that...<br>  some people just jump in and out of relationships too soon and that's not healthy or fair too you...<br>  their's nothing cute about carrying baggage from a previous relationship...<br>  tell him how you feel... i'm pretty sure if you had pictures of your ex all over the place he wouldn't like that at all!|`|t5N9QQntaa	Yeah it would be normal maybe you should talk to him about it, and depending how long you guys have been dating maybe you two should start taking pictures and starting your own memories.  or maybe he still love's this girl and could be comparing you to her which is not a good thing.|`|h03FTbXLaa	of course it is!<br>  you like him, and you're worried that he'll want to go back to his relationship with her. but you just need to realize that he is with you now, and he wouldn't be with you if he didnt want to. so don't even worry about it.<br>  hope this helped! :)|`|BDjBVdtRaa	Yes that is VERY normal.

It's only natural for you to be jealous- anyone would be in a situation like this but you should not have put yourself in this position to be in a relationship with a guy who is still hung-up on his ex.  It also doesn't speak very highly of him that he would flaunt pictures of his ex-girlfriend all over the place while he is in a relationship with you.<br>  <br>  Don't be his rebound girl.  Get out while you can.  Let him heal from his past relationship and then if it's meant to be, you and he will reconnect when he is actually ready to be in a relationship and when he's ready to appreciate and respect you.|`|0fQYHgr0aa	you can hate her....but keep it to yourself.

If you love dresses & all things weddings, then it might take you a while.  I just wasn't really into it & didn't stand in the mirror for a long time.  I went to 3 stores I think before finding the one I wanted online.  They happened to have a store by me so I went in, tried it on, it fit, and I bought it.  I guess it depends how upscale of a store you're going to, but I don't think they would rush you out at your exact 1 hour deadline unless they were overwhelmingly busy.  They do want you to buy something & I found most of the girls to be really helpful & accommodating.|`|kfgx4PjUaa	I think you will definitely need more than an hour, unless you find "THE" dress first off.

That means it should only take you 6 minutes to get undressed, put each dress on, check yourself out in the mirror, get opinions of whoever you came with, and take it back off (not to mention the time it takes to come in, say hello to the sales people, etc.)  In an hour, I would say you can try on 4, maybe 5 dresses.  Try on the 5 you like most and if you still haven't found one you're thrilled with, then make a second appointment.<br>  I went shopping for dresses 3 times and on the 4th found my gown.  First time with my mom, once with MOH, once with a bridesmaid, and the final time with my mom again.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|q8eue7CRaa	How my visit worked was that I was allowed to first pick out 4 dresses then try those out. (The dress I ended up getting was one of those 4!!) I then tried on probably 10 more dresses!!!! But I ended up with one of the first I tried on, like I said. See how it goes - if you don't find what you want in an hour, just don't buy yet. The amount of dresses you try on in an hour depends on how busy the store is. I wasn't allowed to get in/out the dresses without help so had to wait for the consultant a lot (which added to the time)|`|AA10861417	Honestly, when I went in the store and had 5 or 6 dresses to try on.   I took the one that I liked the best and tried it on first.   From that point on, I just compared the others to it.   After days of looking and trying on - I went back to get the very first dress I tried on.   But I continued to look to make sure I got the one I liked the best.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	I visited 3 different stores and spent 3 hours at the last one (david's bridal) before picking the right dress.

I ended up finding my dream dress that day - totally surprised myself.   I was there for about 3 hours.  I think the experience of the shopping should be really fun for you and don't put a lot of pressure to find the one right away, and if it happens it happens.  Also, I would recommend setting up an appointment that same day at another bridal shop in the area as well - that way you know you are getting the chance to really see your selections.  I found my dress the first day, but waited a week to buy it because I wanted to go to another store first to try on a specific dress I had seen - I went and tried it on and all I could think about was the dress from the first day.  That solidified it for me.|`|nsWkuoVpaa	Maybe I was lucky, but I picked out the second dress I tried on at the first bridal shop I went to.  There was just something about it and I didn't need to try on any more gowns.  I knew it was the one.  <br>  <br>  I guess it would depend where you go and how many other brides are there that day.<br>  <br>  Either way, good luck!|`|gKuHTs1Caa	you have to have an idea of what you want, take pics w/ you from magazine & then they can help you match it. i found my dress the 2nd shop i went to. $500 7 yrs ago., in pasadena.|`|0jUGSaZPaa	Wow, only an hour?  That's silly...  You should be able to take as long as you want, if they want your sale!!<br>  <br>  Anyway, besides the point, I went to two stores.<br>  I fell in love with TWO gowns... One at the first store and one at David's Bridal.<br>  <br>  After deliberating (while in gown #2!!), I thought about my wedding atmosphere...  It's a summer wedding and outside.  The 2nd gown was much more practical and LIGHT for a summer wedding, so I bought it. :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Both days were at least a couple hours...|`|hkwBR1moaa	I fell in love with my dress before I was even engaged. We were dress shopping for my sister in law and I saw it in a window.  When I got engaged a couple of months later, we went to a few different stores and finally back to David's Bridal where I tried on a bunch of dresses.  The dress I fell in love with months earlier was the last one I tried on and that was it.  That's the dress I ended up with.

Cv2h6n1Raa	The line that I use is when it is silent for a little while say "you know, You can really tell when you feel comfortable with someone when its silent, and it doesn't feel weird". This will get you guys talking to each other about how comfortable you both feel around each other and maybe even deeper feelings. It also sets the tone for when you guys don't have anything to say later on, then you kind of know your both fine with it.

Dont walk out alone or return home alone, get a taxi please (and not a mini cab), i'm in Kent, not London, and there must be a ton of places you can dance near you home.

You don't want him to see a lazy slob [and i'm not trying to be mean] but you want his eyes to pop out and be like, wow and you can finally say to him "eat your heart out" cause you're over him.

Just get over it. I know it sounds harsh, but that's all there is to it. He obviously wasn't the right guy, and if he comes crawling back to you, he's a stupid pansy and I hope you say no and explain to him how much he hurt you. My advice is to go out and get a job and start over. Just forget about him. He's not worth it.|`|i54Qzohyaa	you should stop thinking of him.<br>  and you know.<br>  try to make a NEW you.<br>  you deserve wayyy better than him.<br>  find someone else.<br>  dont hold on to him.<br>  also, i think that you cant get over him because you miss all the things you guys do.<br>  so yeah.<br>  also, be dependent. dont let him see you living in a miserable life.<br>  it'll make him think that you're a desperate woman.
CYwha8Baaa	WOW.... he is presisting to meet her, because he probably wants to introduce to his family... which is really sweet...<br>  <br>  I wouldnt bother asking him again if he is the type of guy to make plans and stick with maybe he is busy doing something at his place or homework, or planning something special for the dinner.<br>  <br>  Honestly that is really sweet that he is putting this effort into it... i think he is a keeper
qDpFSqn4aa	Consider him coming at the time you set.  He probably took the time as conformation.  It sounds like something I'd do.  If he's always shown up then take it for granted he's going to this time.  You asked why he'd want to meet your mother?  Many guys want to know what their girl will look like when she gets older and the best way to see it is by seeing her mother.  In most cases the daughter turns out just like the mother.  There are a few times when this isn't true.  I once dated a girl who was skinny but her mother was a little large.  This is my guess on that one.  He must be considering making you his total girlfriend.  If that's the case then you're in for a pretty nice future.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question, have fun.
71EwzPSlaa	this is the problem with texting lol...you need to call him if its this important...next if he is insisting on meeting your mom then that means its prolly a big deal and he might want to go farther in ur relationship like maybe hed like you to meet his parents so they know who hes dating you know....id call him and find out what his plans are thats the only sure way you can know cuz if he "never gets the text" then he might just be blowing you off....call and confirm and see what happens then...|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	They aren't answering because <br>  1) the question is too long<br>  2) You said yourself he is the type to keep plans, so he is coming.<br>  3) No one knows the answer to why he wants to meet your mother.|`|e98RKB35aa	You are putting too much into this. Just wait and see. If he is one of those guys that say they are coming and follows through then wait and see. If he does a no call no show then try to find him and try to get it out of him why he did that.|`|g1OoQPraaa	if you dont' get an answer from him and it will end up giving you anxiety the rest of the day so that you can't even enjoy the time you have with your mother who it sounds like you don't get to see that often, then isnt it worth it just to get a confirmation even at the risk of 'annoying' him?|`|5ZwuIVPdaa	maybe he really wants to meet her but worries or not that she will exept him dating her daughter... dont worry like u said he will show up.|`|PY160XO7aa	DONT want to read a book 1 paragraph would be nice|`|jAQVFrvOaa	I have no clue on why he would be insisting on meeting your mother so soon. but some guys are like that for some reason. I think maybe you should wait a lil while to c if he responds. Dont keep textin over and over he may think your pushin the issue or being clingy (even though it was his idea). If he misses the dinner then thats when you can start and wonder y.. If he always comes then he'll prolly come, but if he doesnt then be4 u yell or accuse ask y.
52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Men can separate emotion and the physical act.  It feels good, is the correct answer.

Seems pretty obvious to me.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	Babez you have to understand Men by nature, at their Core, are Polygamous. That's just the way God made Men. Don't believe me ?? Look at every historical writing from dawn of time from the book Gilgamesh to the Holy Bible. Men for thousands upon thousands of years had more than 1 woman *at a time*.  You can't just take that out of Man's psychology because modern society makes it trendy to have 1 woman in your life. And to answer your question more directly for a Guy to have meaningless flings esteems his Pride/Honor/Ego.|`|JCdBSULraa	Well men need sexual release about 15-30 times a week, when women only want it at most 3 times.. do the math.. how many women do we need to meet our needs?<br>  <br>  I'm not saying it's right, because it's clearly not, but that's the biological explanation.|`|CtJeNwu8aa	Well I need sex whether I'm in a relationship or not.

I think you just like him a great deal.|`|ktE3fETKaa	see your only 16 dont rush in to things just yet u might get hurt|`|AA11289793	Just like flirt with him a lot and suggest things to him so that he thinks that you care about him, and like try to get him to ask you to go out on a date.<br>  <br>  If I were you I wouldn't tell him that you love him, because if anything, after that amount of time, it will just scare him away and it will make you look like an immature little girl. So I would try to hold off telling him that for a little while...
8o1ZdCkuaa	A lover is just someone that you hook-up with. <br>  <br>  A boyfriend or girlfriend is someone who is both your lover and trusted friend.  It's someone you can confide in, feel passion for, feel love for and someone you can trust.  It's also someone you are in a monogamous relationship with.|`|AA11447210	Lover is primarily a sex partner, you may occasionally go out with but aren't in a commited situation.<br>  <br>  Boyfriend/girlfriend is someone you may or may not have sex with, but are seeing each other exclusively and date and participate in various activities together (often, fairly frequently).|`|L0Hz227xaa	A lover is just a sex partner that you may date occasionally but really only are friends with benefits. This usually never goes into a relationship or commitment. <br>  <br>  A girlfriend/boyfriend is someone who you are seeing exclusivly and care for. You put their needs before yours and spends alot of time with you. They do not see other people and claim you as their partner. You make future goals and plans together for maybe a larger commitment if it is a sucessful relationship.
tIez5HWBaa	whats so wrong with hugging? its a sign of friendship and caring, which a person can feel towards friends and family, it is not an exclusive gf/bf gesture<br>  <br>  kissing however... is an issue|`|5ZwuIVPdaa	i think its perfectly fine to hug another girl if ur in a relationship. sure it could be akward for u but hugs isnt such a serious think like kissing and doing IT. and if it reallly bothers u just start huggin some guy friends and think wat the guy thinks about it.|`|uhZneNORaa	I'd get mad as he doesn't have any girl friends that he has told me he was close with!|`|4YK4tBW5aa	It depends on how serious the relationship is. If you are an adult and are married or in a long term committed relationship, then he shouldn't be hugging anyone secretly that you don't know he is close with. Ideally any other woman he is on a hugging basis with, you are friends with her too and approve of her.<br>  <br>  If you are not in the kind of relationship I just described, or you are still in jr. high or high school, then back off and stop being so controlling. There's nothing wrong with hugging other girls as friends, as long as he isn't doing any actual cheating with them.|`|kHLwlNA5aa	I see no problem if he is just hugging another girl.

axCFlk5Zaa	Your attracted to how they act, their personal hygiene etc. I doubt you are attracted to them solely based on their sexuality. <br>  <br>  You just not as attracted to the muscular, stupid, arrogant type guys that most girls fall for. Nothing wrong with that. <br>  <br>  Your just looking for a more feminine guy. You sort of answer your own question. <br>  <br>  Would you really rather be attracted to the normal guy?|`|xXGn1zfsaa	Because gay guys are generally more feminine than straight guys, they "get us" and understand more where we're coming from, they actually take time to make themselves look good (hair, personal hygiene, style, etc.).... it's great! I wish there would be more metrosexual guys|`|2hLMsZueaa	because they are so feminine and they understand woman well :)<br>  probably thats why you like em|`|kpKlXWVkaa	Sounds like you're a subconscious "F.A.G. hag".|`|awskuSGBaa	Because they are Fabulous.|`|AnfbrZFuaa	Maybe cuz you feel safer with them.

jnIGCkawaa	you'll find the perfect one<br>  don't worry.<br>  you'll deserve her when you do as long as you treat her right|`|NgUbzaF9aa	"Bad Guy's", aren't as alluring as they may seem...<br>  <br>  Let me give you an example. I had a friend who is really nice. She's smart, articulate, caring and an all around friendly and outgoing person. Every time I would catch up with her on the phone or go out with her, I would see her getting with a seemingly nice guy...Okay, so he drinks, he might have had a lot of partners before, loose morals...<br>  <br>  All the men she's gone out with I would describe as "bad boy's". I'm not sure if that necessarily means that they're getting into trouble with the law; just that they live a life of debauchery, if you will.<br>  The problem is, bad boys never like being with one girl. They can't take that type of commitment or deal with the complications of love that they can't comprehend.<br>  <br>  I am and was always a girl who seeks for a honest to goodness relationship, and when I finally found it, and always wonder why so many girls fall for jerks. I like the nice guys. Hell, I love the nice guys. My boyfriend is an extremely nice guy. Nice guy doesn't have to be that they are overly sensitive, or that they can't protect the one they love.<br>  <br>  Nice guys try to understand a woman's feelings. The might actually listen to what a woman has to say. They're supportive of what you do in your life...And so on<br>  <br>  Don't ever try to be someone you're not. If you're nice, be nice. Don't try to act like a jerk because that's what some women are attracted too. I think most women would rather have a sweet charming man, rather then someone who will most likely never mature.|`|w29tsXLUaa	I think what is happening here is you are not forward enough with the girls. Somebody else beats you to it.<br>  <br>  My advice. Stop standing back, when you see a young lady you like, don't hesitate, ask her out for a date.<br>  <br>  The bad boys are not for me. I would go for a loving fellow every-time.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Hope you soon make that step forward and find a few lovely girls to date.|`|CEKAqtB1aa	It doesn't matter, everyone is different so just take your time and find the right girl for you, who knows your first girlfriend might turn out to be the one and you won't ever have to worry about heartbreak.<br>  Girls don't/won't care if you've never had a girlfriend.|`|fG1MiW5maa	im 23 never had a boyfriend.. always been a friend but nothing more.. bad boys can be fun until the fun wears thin and they get bored, then they head off after someone else, ive seen it happen too many times to friends.. <br>  ya id be delighted if the right guy comes along but for the minute im happy single... dont worry too much your time wil come...|`|06c2b2bf8d25233ed0327b25ec9921e0aa	I hung out with a girl last week, eventhough she is not really my type, she initiated the friendship, and her ex-boyfriend, she told me that she was his first girlfriend and he was 24.

As they get older, they grow into themselves, and are likely to to find of others of substantial character to be friends with.

So just play it cool, if you like a lass, make it known to her, gauge her reaction and then act appropriately. If they find it weird that you like them, then just back off and move on. If they seem vaguely interested then maybe ask them to a party you're going to. try and avoid awkward one on one situations where you're going to have no mates to fall back on when the conversation gets a bit strained. <br>  <br>  Mainly, keep it cool, dont be calling or texting em every 5 minute. and to start off with always try have a few mates (and other lasses to make her feel comfortable) there to talk to as well.

Just keep it low key. Don't be "too nice." It's a sign of insecurity. Insecurity in the sense that you're trying to hard, and failing each time before them. Don't be the one to offer favors. Relax a bit...go out for a beer, and be a good listener, but don't be a problem solver. Give good advice, but don't act like you're smarter than them. You can talk about your experiences, but don't give away too much. Your private stuff always keep private.

Honestly, I appreciate guys who hold out on that for awhile, because then I feel like we would be on equal terms. It's just my opinion though. I've noticed that a lot of guys can get clingy when they think you like them, so just be polite, and  give her some space at first. Chivalry, protectiveness and a good sense of humor are very important. Those are some of my favorite characteristics of a guy :] I think that's universal though. I'm sure you'll find someone, you seem to be overall concerned with it, so that shows you care.

jJZz2U8Gaa	If he is getting all of the benefits and you have no expectations, I find it hard to believe that he will just commit to you one day if he doesn't have to. I personally would take sex out of the equation and see what he wants to do. Does he still want to be friends? If yes, then he genuinely cares for you and wants you in his life and maybe someday you can be in a real relationship. Get the sex out of it. It's not going to help him decide how much he likes you.|`|Lt03NhXPaa	i was in the same position for a long time it was about 3 years and it is still sometimes like that and we still care for each other... but i think if he hints around that you have a nice body and all then he likes you and you should keep going with it and maybe he will ask you out...
kbiwj6qdaa	Well first of all i think guys need to be just as obvious as girls, how else would we know , if we are going to cut them a break then they should cut us one too, If you really like this guy I would say flirt with him , do something nice to him. Point is to let him know that you see him as more than a friend and you treat him differently than you do others, at some point he has to step up and make a move to, don't do all the work!!!|`|GFiKQIGpaa	tell him you've got nothing to lose and give him Delicious food when you tell him|`|ekrTfdFlaa	bake him a cake. men love getting fat|`|6286059824182c4e7ff0e287e5969887aa	Ask him out on a date...but don't really ask : would you like to go out on a date with me? ... you could ask him : how about we have coffee sometime? or : why don't we get ourselves a nice drink at the ( good cafe or bar whatever place you choose). this way you're asking him on a date without actually asking for the date, and it's fairly obvious that you are interested. if he doesn't get it then you should find yourself a real man :) best of luck to you.|`|zVjCUUAmaa	I love the food comments. mostly because they're usually true ;P<br>  <br>  some guys pick up on body language, depending on the guy. If he's typical though, it usually takes a direct approach.
tY4hOjqdaa	Not enough info but if u have been texting him and now you are on the phone with him next, he could be reserved, especially when on the phone with someone he likes - might not want to say the wrong thing. Just talk to hm in person soon and u can tell from his mannerisms and demeanor as to whether or not he is into u....|`|tIez5HWBaa	see there are so many problems with texting. you should call him, and see how that goes, it will give you a better indicator of what his feelings are.
uBssj3Znaa	maybe you should suggest talking a shower together ... turn clean time into fun foreplay time.|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	ask her if she wants to foreplay in the shower|`|9hreptv4aa	this is a very sensitive subject to some woman so one thing you can do is take  a shower with you that is the best way to get rid of the smell if it is that bad|`|xQnkYyocaa	Maybe you should start your foreplay in the shower. Tell her you want to wash each others back. BUT- IF SHE NEEDS TO SHOWER FIRST YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT THAT DOWN BELOW!!!|`|Xu71saGaaa	Tell her you want to take a shower first and ask her to join you.. Best way imo<br>  <br>  Edit: Gah Morb you beat me to it lol|`|PWN5rqgxaa	yeah after you start kissing and getting naked... whisper in her ear... lets get in the shower|`|IWO1GTpGaa	There is no nice way to put that a girl stink.  My girl was allergic to soap that has smells and chemicals that produce those smells.  Every time I went down to lick it I smelled an aroma that just turned me off.  I wasn't gong to beat around the bush, but I didn't say "Damn girl you need to o wash that thing."  All I said was, "Baby I do not have no problem pleasuring you because I like making you feel good, but if you want to me to continue pleasuring you your going to have to suffer the allergic symptoms or buy soap with no smell because it don't smell to peachy down there."  Of course she bought the soap and of course she was a little mad and embarrassed, but at least I told the truth rather than completely stop pleasuring her and make excuses on why I stopped.|`|YkLAFRAxaa	shower together:)<br>  me and my boyfriend do it all the time:)<br>  funnnn!!!!!!!;)
C9QQPROkaa	He/She wants to be able to have "dealings" with not only you but other people. If that's what someone wants you to deal with don't its not worth putting your heart into. If your ok with it though that's what it means and have fun.|`|U8rtc4nIaa	It means that they want the benefits of what comes with a relationship but they don't want the obligation of being tied down. They want that freedom to do as they please and if they don't feel like hanging out with you for a week then you can't get mad at them for it. No strings attached.|`|5ZwuIVPdaa	u dont want to be married because that would tie u down and u wouldnt be able to flert around, hang out with friend, etc... as much as u used to..|`|uBssj3Znaa	that the person wants to be free to date around|`|7ko9czaaaa	thay are not wanting to be with only one woman or man, thay are still looking,
CYwha8Baaa	Strings attached....<br>  <br>  Girls like that are impossiable to be with... honestly because they have the freedom to do what they want when they want...<br>  <br>  Afraid of commiment is like saying he sign this contract and that means no more boys or girls to flirt or date again<br>  <br>  I see comminment being a MARRIAGE<br>  A realtionship and TITLE of bf and gf is no really scary<br>  <br>  If you really like this girl I wouldnt be friends with benefits<br>  <br>  Because you will end up getting screwed and honestly I know you dont want that<br>  <br>  If you want friends with benefit with her then make sure YOU WEAR a condom you dont know who and what she is SCREWING<br>  <br>  AND GET TESTED<br>  1 and 4 people have GENTIAL WARTS<br>  <br>  SCARY I KNOW!
GkPeIQ9Maa	It is Very Appropriate to ask where this is going.. You need to for you and have every right to know for yourself..<br>  <br>  Don't wait to do it either..<br>  <br>  Do It Right This Second..|`|EQP8VZwiaa	Wow, I'm in the same situation currently. I talk to the guy I'm seeing everyday but he's never referred to me as his girlfriend. I've been wanting to ask him how he would "classify" our relationship but I can't get up the nerve. I don't know why, I can talk to him about everything else. We've only been seeing each other a few months but he knows me better than anyone. Sorry, I didn't even answer your question. It's just nice to know there's someone out there who gets where I'm coming from. Guys say that girls are complicated. I think it's the other way around! Good luck.
Un9CElCaaa	if u have been friends with this guy a long time it makes sense. however if this is not the case than that is just weird
uTQCKQQ9aa	as long as there are feelings its not over you just have to figure out what the feelings mean.|`|lpaUM0ceaa	If it keeps going on and off, then its time to move on.

OFJFLs2Paa	If he can get any girl that he wants then he might like you, but the thing is if he is asking what you did with your exs then that means that he wants to sleep with you. He just wants to see how far  he can get with you if he really did get with you. He is trying to trick you with his charm. What ever you do don't fall for it at all. If you like him then I would go for him and see if for a fact that is what he wants. Also if you find out that is what he wants then I would leave him. Good Luck and I really hope that it is not because he wants to sleep with you! =D

MjK9hkyGaa	yes. I'm a girl and i have a boyfriend and it is waaay easier for girls to cheat. Its not nessicarily cheating all of the time but its extreme flirting/leading guys on. I stoped my extreme flirting maybe a month ago because i started to notice how much i loved my boyfriend and if he was doing the same thing i was doing...i would raise hell and i would be hurt but in the end i would be doing the same thing. Girls are very...slick when it comes to cheating. Girls are natural flirts, and trust me...its waaay easier.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	I've found that to be true from personal experience.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	yes girls do|`|9fEeteY0aa	A recent Cosmopolitan Magazine poll had it that about 45% of women under 35 will cheat on at least one of their partners.|`|s8yCwPedaa	More than guys do.
112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	Difficult one, such an old rule every religion says it.  can you just stop & still not do any other sin because you no longer do this one?<br>  <br>  I know you love Allah, but Allah gave you your body and gave you the right to pleasure.  Just as other Gods give to the people.  I don't know, I felt I was missing out a bit by following religion all the time.  Plus there were so many things that I thought were wrong - such as women being inferiour to men.<br>  <br>  Many things were taken out of the bible to keep women under mens control.  Not sure if it's the same for Muslim?  <br>  <br>  Good luck with allowing complete control over your life!<br>  <br>  I hope you are blessed by Allah whatever you choose to do & I hope yr blessed by Buddha & Christ as well xxxxxxxxx|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Who ever told you it's wrong is out of their flipping mind.  If God didn't want people to masturbate he wouldn't have given us the tools to masturbate.  If I were you, I'd get some truth instead of those BS lies.|`|JCdBSULraa	It depends on where you are and what sect of Islam.  Many Muslims will insist that you undergo a female circumcision so that you can never feel the bliss of orgasm again.   Islam is an extremely cruel religion for females.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of man-made control in Islam, and without the evil desires of priests and clerics holding it together, telling everyone what to do, most Muslims end up converting to Christianity, which is only subjected to the Bible, without human influence.|`|PdItdJkKaa	Stop, <br>  <br>  Pray about it.<br>  <br>  If you find you can't control your desires easily,<br>  <br>  And if you are of marriageable age and have a favourable suitor you should marry him so that your desires are met.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|H4bYFqwPaa	there's nothing wrong with it. keep doing it if it feels good. do you really trust a god that would prefer you to eat filthy little animals like chicken but not a clean healthy one like pork? if it feels good then why is it wrong?|`|GVlzdZKsaa	It is NOT WRONG.  Keep doing it.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	ask for forgiveness but don't put it in your mind that your never gonna do it again. it's like saying god forgive me for being rude to my parents and i am never ever going to do it again. it's impossible. your going to be rude to your parents again and your going to masturbate again. Don't be hard on youself your a human being .And your going to mess  mess up a thousand times. the important thing is you give your best effort to do what is right and if you slip. not a problem, just get back up, dust yourself off and keep doing your best to do what is right. remember God is Most Merciful|`|9cPZDkhpaa	Everyone does it, just except that.|`|4P7N6XULaa	carry on regardless, your god doesn't want you to be happy? you're not hurting anyone|`|hIwJxNVkaa	ummm.. well your human.. so .... ya.. masturbation is actually quite healthy..|`|TB0p2sZkaa	idk|`|wLwtUzqKaa	follow ur heart

So there is nothing wrong in YOU approaching him.|`|2aE0BxfFaa	Make him feel bad and ask him does he like you and if he says yea, then ask him why doesn't try to talk to you.

I think the question you should be asking is whether or not this guy is worth your time. If you come to yes as an answer, don't let him chase after you, ask him out on a date. That whole "men should ask the girl out" and "men should do the pursuing" nonsense is machismo Bull S*** that only gets in the way of a healthy functioning society, not to mention a healthy functioning relationship.
qDpFSqn4aa	After dating a short while he will see you as HIS "hot chick".  I once dated a girl that was so beautiful, I didn't think I had a chance in the world to be with her.  She was a Goddess in my book and she asked me out.  I thought it was just a pretty girl wanting to get a fee meal or nigh out on the town with nothing to come of it but she really floored me when she kissed me goodnight.  I couldn't figure out why this beautiful young thing could ever want to be with someone that was twice her age but she did.  She was my Goddess, all mine and I didn't ever want to lose her so I got jealous which drove her to cheat on me after about two years of being together.  I brought it on myself and I don't blame her for it.<br>  <br>  When you've been together for a little while you'll know that you're not just another "hot chick".  Just stick with him and you'll make him the happiest guy in the world.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|dsphYli4aa	you can tell by  wen he flirts with you and then goes off and flirts with some other person and has had a lot of gf's, and wen he asks you out and then you find out he;s asked sum1 out just hours b4 he asked you! trust me been there and done that! Dont let him control you, if you think he's playing you PLAY HIM BACK!|`|CtJeNwu8aa	He actually listens to you.
uTNKfpV6aa	Not only would it hurt you, but the sex will not be good, at all. You're first time, he should be taking charge, so at least someone knows what the hell they're doing. Talk to him, tell him you want him to take charge, cause you don't know what to do. Tell him to stop being a lazy a--hole and get over it, you'll be on top soon enough! USE A CONDOM!!!! I can not stress this enough!.. And tell him to start slow, only putting a little bit of himself inside you at a time, and slowly entering you more. Use lube, if you need it, some girls do. Keep in mind, if you need lube, it doesn't mean you're a "dried up old hag" it mean that that's how much your body lubricates itself, and everyone's body is different.|`|Lt03NhXPaa	i would tell him that you dont think you can do top because i cant and i just told my boyfriend and he does top so just tell him...|`|tIez5HWBaa	tell him, communication is the one of the most important things in a situation like this|`|ekrTfdFlaa	pay a hooker to put on a strap on and do you missionary...|`|JAzYCgkCaa	Question : Is your guy a virgin - Cause if he is...chances are he is just as nervous about it as you are. Even if he has had sex before he may not be comfortable with what he has to offer. If you really don't want to be on top talk to him about it and reassure him or explore other positions you could try. Also, your finger isn't a good representation of what it will be like. Take it slow and find out what works for the two of you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|O97IVzIhaa	A lot of guys are obsessed with women going on top.  A lot of guys do missionary anyway.  Since your a Virgin your really going to have to communicate if one of your fingers hurt you.  Just hope he knows what hes doing and don't hesitate to instruct him a little.|`|AA11447210	That's "lose" (not loose) and plenty of guys still do missionary.<br>  <br>  As for top, many women find being on top the first time easier for them because they are more in control of how fast and deep the penetration occurs...on bottom, you are completely subject to his movements.<br>  <br>  Your finger and his penis are not the same thing (hopefully) but no matter what direction you are penetrated from, chances are the first time (or few times) will be very uncomfortable. Best to put yourself in control of the discomfort though, instead of relying on someone else to stop when you say so...<br>  <br>  FYI: If you aren't at least 18 and legally responsible for the possible consequences (pregnancy, STD transmission, etc) you've no business allowing a penis near your vagina.
R3OV3TJeaa	It's hard to find lobe online because you truly don't know the person. I've had friends that said "oh heck yes I know them well, we've been online dating and chatting for 2 years."  Well then they move in together and within 2 or 3 months it falls apart.  People can act a certain way online, they can tell you anything they want you to believe, but in reality it's usually not as it appears.  Good luck.
C9QQPROkaa	Only the really mature guys for some guys its an attraction for a girl to be virgin for others its like putting a target sign on your back. If a guy really likes you he will respect your decision.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	In general 'd have to say no but I'm not like most guys.  Yes I respect any girl who wants to save herself for marriage.  It's a very honorable thing.  It shows me that she really cares about herself.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|GVlzdZKsaa	NO they want a girl that will go to bed with them 3 times a day.|`|NJv2zKxnaa	Depends on how nice, thoughtful and deep they are. If they have a good heart, they will respect your decision.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	That depends on how they are. Some no, some yes, you need to talk about such things.|`|QHnS31Scaa	depends|`|Xu71saGaaa	Thats a tough one.. Yes and no.... would be a great thing to have on the honey-moon but can you go out with a girl for sometimes up to a few years before you get married and not have sex???? Thats the tough question lol
4IFXHz80aa	im an advocate of dating older men; not too old, but older. i was 18 when i started dating my husband who was 24. we are 5 1/2 years apart and we are both on the same maturity level.  this is why i like dating older guys.  i would suggest getting to know him a little longer before you move in. im not saying you have to get married to live together, but get in a comfortable routine before making that step. work on your communication with each other. this will save you later in life. <br>  <br>  but i will caution, you have to be in a stable relationship with yourself in order for the relationship to work. one reason why i was successful in my relationship is b/c i went through a lot of hard stuff growing up. i matured quickly, not all women will. take it slow.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|N9WzNLsRaa	I'm assuming you haven't known this man for very long because you two have only gone on two dates... What also worries me is the fact that you're still VERY young and VERY impressionable. You two are already telling each other you love one another? Wow. What gets me about young girls dating older men is the fact that older men can put whatever he wants in your head and you all will EAT IT UP. Yes, they can be VERY controlling but they will say it's because they love you. Don't fall for it. <br>  <br>  You don't sound very mature, so don't move in with him. That is the BIGGEST and DUMBEST mistake most women make PERIOD! Regardless of age.
bmi4Xlbfaa	You shouldn't say you regret not going out with her, since you were young and it probably wouldn't have worked out anyway. But if you really like her now, first make sure she doesn't have a boyfriend. Then ask her if she would like to grab lunch or something sometime to catch up, as friends. Once you start hanging out with her it will be a lot more easy to get a vibe of whether it is heading towards friendship or more. If it's going well, just go with your gut, and ask her out on a real date. Your instincts are usually right, and as long as she isn't seeing anyone she is most likely interested. Just don't rush things.|`|Xu71saGaaa	Heres what you do.. get into another conversation with her. Than casually ask her if she remembers asking you out way back when.. tell her you would like to answer that question now :)|`|JDiHhUeGaa	she might just think of you of a really good friend, but you should try flirting and see how she reacts. <br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|NviCwaroaa	I guess you have to ask yourself do you want her friendship or do you want to be her lover? <br>  As for the other..<br>  <br>  " The only thing we have to fear is fear it self"<br>  Girls do not like a man to be unsure nor do they like to be lied to. If you chose to take this relationship to the next level.Make sure you are crystal clear on your intentions. Do not tell her it is the "real deal" when it is just a "thing". The reason why women get so mad or become psycho is when they are lied to. Maybe you should ask her some basics meaning the "W'S" who, what, when .where, why. Then you will know how she feels. I found the biggest mistake people make is assuming and not asking. Good  luck
oOMWYEyaaa	you just sit down with her, like big adults, and have a serious conversation and express to her that you know of her decision but unfortunately you don't agree to it.

They could mediate and talk to your mother. <br>  <br>  She's probably just scared for you as she does see you as her little girl and know how teenagers can rush into things if they feel pressurised. <br>  So, if you could reassure her in any way, that may help. <br>  You can show her how responsible you are, that you are not drinking, or do go back home in time when she asks you to, etc... <br>  I think that she'd be bound to reconsider and see that after all, having a boyfriend is only natural and also that her teen daughter does have a good head on her shoulders. <br>  <br>  So, just start by not arguing with her when she does forbid you to do something you want. Instead, try and explain to her very patiently why it is important to you. <br>  I'd avoid the "all my friends do it". That has to be the last point in your argument to defend your case. <br>  <br>  And also, maybe you could ask her to take you to the doctor so that you know what to expect. <br>  You need to show her that you are trying to think things through and are not going to act like all those girls who don't think and then behave like idiots. I'm sure you know what I mean. <br>  <br>  Reassure her that you want to get informed, so that when the time is right for you, you know how to react. <br>  <br>  She's bound to be shocked, but at the same time, she'll be impressed. <br>  <br>  Good luck darling. <br>  Remember that if you do have sex with someone who's 16 or over, they can go to jail and will be placed on a sex offender register. <br>  Tell your mum that you're not into rushing things, but it's only natural to have someone special for you to do things with. <br>  And take your time babe.|`|KM50wTbHaa	haha im exactly the same! 14 parents overprotective yep! anyway do what i do... hidden!!! don't lie to your parents just don't blurt anything out.

uTNKfpV6aa	It depends on the person, not their gender... Some bisexual girls are just more comfortable speaking with other girls. My sister is bisexual, and she to me she tends to be a little less nervous with girls, cause she has a basic idea of what's going on in their head. And with guys, she's just lost!!|`|NgUbzaF9aa	I think most bi-sexual women are more comfortable with the same sex. I'm hetero, but let's say if I was just making friends; I would always be more comfortable with women because women understand each other better...<br>  <br>  That's my guess.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	It is easier with both sexes.|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	i am not an expert because i am a girl who is a heterosexual!!<br>  no it isnt that easy <br>  reason: more people are heterosexual so its not that easy for girls to hit on girls or guys to hit on guys. the guy----> girl thing is difinitely easier <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  maybe u should listen to that person who said:<br>  head on: apply directly to the forehead!!!|`|AA11447210	For bisexual women, it may well be easier as women tend to be less intimidated by other women and less likely to suspect ulterior motives.<br>  <br>  However, since more women are straight than bi or gay, in general it doesn't apply.|`|30BcAMXYaa	I Would Have Slaped The Shi* Out Of A L Trying To Take My Number.<br>  Sorry But I Don't Like That Same Sex Loving Shi*.<br>  And It Depends From Women To Women.|`|w782rcwraa	maybe...alot of men seem to be scared of rejection an so girls never get asked out...they then feel lonely and turn to other girls... it could happen...

by0bLBy5aa	Hi, im a student social worker, and am wanting to go into this area of work, i can't see why this would go against you, but as you are probably aware social workers need to know EVERYTHING! With the Victoria Climbie and recent Baby P case they really need 2 b thorough in their work!<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything, i'm sure you'll make wonderful foster parents!|`|3FmO9ACaaa	no this will not go against you but they have to be sure as there is a lot of people that take this care and end up pregnant so reject the foster child.Just be honest and be proud that your doing something to help a child to get on in life.|`|D8Zbijxaaa	Shouldn't be a problem as long as you don't smoke, drink,or are obese, and don't  mention smacking .|`|TCqrS8Vqaa	HIYA, i should think you will be accepted as nearly all the children are either problem kids,teenagers.and kids with a disability.no one does not want these children.my friend and her husband are foster parents.one girl they had come to stay with them,went to school every day, first week they had her.at the weekend she went out to meet a friend,that's what she told my friend,the police brought her back to my friends house at 10 pm.it all came out that she was not going to school,she was going to a older man's house 54yrs old,she is 13yrs old and he was giving her drugs and drink,and she was giving him sex/oral as well.he is in prison now.not all teenagers are trouble,but you can't pick the child you want.its very hard work,looking after them.but if that's what you want to do,make sure you find out all about the child you are having.good luck.x|`|150esu4Daa	I don't think it will go against you. And I wish you good luck! What you are doing is such a wonderful thing and something I hope to do later in my life. More people should follow your example! Good luck!
5c29536e08a5b98c6451c88a20d06461aa	Start walking...  this can only get worse.  No one deserves to be treated poorly.  Sure once and awhile someone will be in a bad mood but it is not right for them to take it our on you.  What is next?  Hitting you then saying "oops... it will never happen again"?  Complete BS.  Tell him to stop it or you will walk.  <br>  <br>  It seems to be mind games that he is playing to have more control over you.
ekrTfdFlaa	ask questions about what she's interested in.<br>  tell stories (real or what you imagine)<br>  mainly the first one though, lead her into saying something.|`|YAplkfZgaa	Ask for her number, and call her.  It's easier to talk on the phone, and if you run out of things to say, well you or her is obviously just a boring person.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Ask her opinion on the news, talk to her about anything. Just think about it. You know your interests talk about them. And find new ones. Just ask her hey what do you think about this or did you see that and keep the initiative. Find the things she likes to talk about and you will be going on again.
rjsfiWt9aa	tell her a funny story about your day (even if its not true, i  mean dont lie about somthing that she might get mad if she found out) just say somthing like "my friend slipped in the cafeteria and got applesauce everywhere!" haha ok thats a lame example but you get the idea. Then create new questions off of that story, idk u could get into a whole conversation about school lunches, then talk about your school, what classes she likes, does she play any sports? All you have to do is come up with one interesting story that could lead to hours of conversations. <br>  <br>  Or, send her a link to a song you like, ask her if she likes it and if its worth making your profile song (if you have a myspace or facebook) ask her what other music she is into.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|JbZInGg7aa	ask her totally random and phiscological questions. like what she thinks about abortion, obama, etc. or ask other random questions like "if you wished on a star right now what would you wish for?" or something like that.<br>  if you guys are friends then just talk.<br>  hope that helps!|`|sMfDrCt9aa	You ask her questions like wanna go to the movies? and things like whats your hobbies and what you been doing recently and then when you get into a conversation, lean in and snog her faceoff.|`|uV9Jvbr8aa	Keep the conversation going by asking things like "So, how was you day?, Doing anything fun later?, Ect. Or try telling a funny story to her.<br>  stay away from questions that can lead to a one-word answer.|`|CtJeNwu8aa	Just be more original bro. Ask her what she's in to or if she ever tried something than invite. I asked this hot chick if she's ever surfed before, she said no, so I took her and we dated for awhile.|`|AuzT4xeGaa	talk slower
fLU63N4kaa	You were totally right to be yourself! And Sarelizabeth is right, if she doesn't want to be your friend for being yourself than she's not a real friend! <br>  <br>  I presume you're in highschool? I find many friends in highschool end up being false anyway. It's all about the popularity. Don't be a sheep and follow the crowd. Be yourself! Be unique! :D|`|CU6HowiVaa	Don't even think about it. You did the right thing. Everybody thinks that they need to change to "fit in". Honestly, im really sick and tired of it. Being your self is the best thing. That way you can make a point about how you wont change unless you think that it's the best thing for you.|`|ntef2sPMaa	Diffently you should make that club. I was going to do that too. i just never had a name and no one seemed interested. and that sucks you lost a friend over that. If she doesnt want to be your friend for who you are then screw her, she wasnt a real friend anyway
IO8INC21aa	sounds like you have a really good relationship..... this might sound cringy for you but sometimes as you would obviously know girls get grouchy for a reason!!! maybe something has bugged her and if she is grouch because of her monthlies get blown into a whole different perspective it might not even be you that has annoyed her!! try talking to her face to face it might sort things out :) hope i have helped xx|`|7EDGtYVoaa	i wouldn't over think it bud.  it just seems like she is going through a mood swing.  let her have a night out with her girls and relax.  sorry I can't help more, but your information was a little confusing<br>  <br>  PS please answer my question<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ame3XX3LJAFruH7tAaWkKAQazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219213039AAM6mG6">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|PVsKQAVEaa	theres a possibility shes thinking over the whole sex thing. shes 16 years old, there that possibility she is nervous about it and maybe doesent want to do it? or maybe she does but shes thinking about it. About her going to a party tonight, she could have forgotten that you had plans today, you should talk to her and remind her that you had plans with her, when you love someone, they are your priority, so iam sure if she loves you, she would rather spend the night with you. remind her... hope this helps bro.|`|bmi4Xlbfaa	Maybe she just needs her space? In my opinion it's not easy being in such a "committed" relationship at 16. She's young and she wants to spend time with her friends and go to high school parties. She's probably not very mature, either, and relationships can get pretty boring at that age if there's no drama. Sounds like you might be too much of a decent guy for her liking. Just talk it out with her and see what's up. You might be overreacting.|`|9hreptv4aa	she could be going through a rough time in her life... i would get her alone and just talk but be gentle bc it could be a sensitive subject to her|`|4P7N6XULaa	She was testing you, she knew that you two had plans to go out (girls never forget). Her friends or she decided that they all had to go to this party, now she either wanted you to get mad at her for her changing the arrangements then she could go to the party "guilt-Free" or her friends made her go and they were testing her to see if she would break arrangements that she had with you to see them. if that makes any sense.<br>  Its all very silly and girls love to play games, almost at much as boys.<br>  Let her go to the party you go to a bar and then you will be even.|`|E7fO9c24aa	Hey<br>  <br>  Okay, it might be that shes met someone else but she feels to guilty to admit it to you.<br>  Or it could be something you said to her.<br>  Its probably something thats going on in her life ... one of the extremes could be shes pregant .<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to talk to her in person and tell her you care about her and you care about her life too.|`|KYJDjEcoaa	In my opinion she's too comfortable, you need to make her work for your affections a little, it sounds to make like she's taking you for granted, she thinks you'll be around forever & so she can talk to you how ever she wants, so make her work for it, be busy, or spend a little more time with you friends the next couple of weeks, be available for her, but maybe don't say i love you so much, or i miss you, make her realize what an amazing boyfriend she has & then she'll stop acting up. & you'll get your girl back. People get complacent all the time in relationships, sometimes you forget how good what you've got is, because you get used to it, you just need to remind her.... but not in a smothering way... what she's got & how lucky she is. Best of luck!|`|Lt03NhXPaa	i think you should tell her that you wanted to spend tonight with her. and dont be like an *** about it just be nice and say baby or w.e. u call her i thought we were going to spend time with each other tonight?<br>  and just go from there.......|`|xzTIB57eaa	she honestly might just be in bad mood and needs some alone time...sometimes its annoying to always have someone texting you and she might just want to breathe a little. Usaully if i'm in a bad mood i am very kurt with sentences and words. Don't let something this small put a strain on your relationship just give her a few hours to snap out of the mood :)|`|xgJbxZgfaa	i wouldn't let my boyfriend go to a party with just his boys after i made plans with him.|`|tPRRUs4Jaa	"if you go out don't act stupid. When you do... you get me mad and I want to break up with you. Then I'm telling her yea I'm not going to mess around don't worry and shes like good boy or else."<br>  <br>  ...did you cheat on her before or something? cuz that's what it sounds like to me is the only issue here. & the fact that she's going out with her girls when you two had plans. i would say talk to her about it. just say "um, i thought we had plans??" it's not a big deal, don't make it one. just bring it up casually and you guys can always hang out like tomorrow or something too if you just want it to be a girls/boys night for each of you. and make sure you guys are okay. sounds like you are other than the breaking plans thing. <br>  <br>  anyway, good luck! :)

You can change your expectations to accommodate him, but would you feel like you were settling?  If you would, then you should move on so you can give yourself a chance to find someone that lives up to your expectations, or is so wonderful that you don't mind adjusting your expectations.  In the end, I don't know why people stay in relationships when they aren't happy with it.  It's one thing if you are married and/or have kids, but if you neither of those is the case, go find something better.

CKd4bnV7aa	This question is a singles and dating question because?|`|L3DlYjWEaa	HARRY POTTER all the way!!!!!!<br>  Twilight sux its too pre teeny<br>  if u want a real vampire series check out <br>  Anne Rice's Vampire Cronicals|`|Efn4lj5vaa	harry potter, definitely|`|qwhI0AZXaa	twilight|`|qwvijKexaa	harry potter|`|Xu71saGaaa	HP|`|B83DTe78aa	Oooh... the burning question.<br>  <br>  I love both. I think many people prefer Twilight because of the satisfaction with the ending with Edward. I mean, everyone is in love with edward.<br>  <br>  But, the difference with HP is that the ending is about his fued with voldy...not with ginny. Oh i know "the 17 years later" with ron and hermione and Harry and ginny with thier little children is love but it's not the raging passion that bella has for edward.<br>  <br>  <br>  They are both so totaly different.<br>  I love twilight but HP has a little place in my heart.|`|TfHdQHR7aa	Harry Potter.<br>  i was the biggest twilight fan since the book first came out but they really dont have anything on hp & the twilight movie was possibly the worst thing. <br>  twilight is just popular with girls, and harry potter is literally a classic.<br>  <br>  tell you friend that rob pattinson WAS IN harry potter 4 & they only reason hes cute in twilight is cuz he wears more makeup than a prositute.<br>  hope this helps lol.|`|Dp11yGi9aa	In my personal opinion... twilight!|`|DYoyrsT3aa	harry potter|`|KaQ2h8LOaa	twilight|`|Ctq3pcIsaa	Harry Potter wins by 1 point|`|j0EmrNOlaa	OMG TWILIGHT !!! <3|`|AlezPEcYaa	twilight is way more better than harry potter!!!!!!|`|V3NQKYzdaa	twilight|`|fjZ8FVdeaa	harry potter|`|LFd0Mprtaa	I think it is harry potter|`|FkJgd8o4aa	I'm sure there's a reason this is posted under "Singles".
0fVtHNtmaa	Use your intuition, watch for red flags.|`|ff545BLyaa	Well I don't know exactly but I like to think that I am a gentleman.  I do not think it can be so hard perhaps you are just looking in the wrong places, that being said morales have completely gone out the window in most of america.  Most of my good friends are all really great guys, and gentleman.  That being said we are all army guys....|`|AMTYPir7aa	it is difficult you have to look for the signs. what does being treated good entail? if your man is going days without calling you (text messages need not apply) then he is doing other things with his time like seeing his other girlfriend. <br>  <br>  there are books that will help you see the warning signs of many different types of losers and it helps to understand these things early on in a relationship before you start to fall for a chump.
tYO2Ir1oaa	It's down to preference.<br>  <br>  I like my man to be a similar height to me, or a couple of inches taller, not much more. I like to be on the same level and don't like looking up to men|`|Un9CElCaaa	i dont think there is a perfect height. either u are good for each other or your not. height should have nothing to do with a relationship. ive dated girls that are taller and girls that are shorter. its much too hard to find the right person when u worry so much about something like height|`|YPCFzVMfaa	there is no real "perfect" height for a couple there is about 4" between me and my bf....so dont worry bout it :D|`|NxBYuOzbaa	My huband is about 6 inches taller than me, but then again EVERYONE is taller than me. I'm only 5 foot tall, and he's 5 foot 6, but I love it because I can wear 2, 3, 4, 5 inch heels and still be shorter than him ; )<br>  <br>  Anyways it's all preference.|`|ZAvV3WfLaa	The height doesn't make a difference, aslong as they like each other thats all that counts :]|`|PDffAFf3aa	when shes 5ft and hes 6ft5!! lol|`|j0EmrNOlaa	does it matter when your in love ?<br>  but id say hed have to be a little bit taller than her<br>  <br>  xx<br>  x|`|uTAiLcPTaa	too tal
YbwDFvEaaa	This may sound insensitive but...perhaps you should sell the ring on eBay or something of the like. I would suggest giving it to another friend but then that runs the risk of you seeing it all the time, and that can be pretty painful, seeing the ring meant for your ex on the hand of someone else all the time.<br>  <br>  If the ring is engraved or something like that which makes it too personalized to sell to anyone else, then you may want to consider actually giving it to her, but when her birthday comes up or some other occasion where giving her a gift would be appropriate. THis places a little less pressure on the gift, but at least it gets into the hands of who you intended the gift to originally be for.|`|ff545BLyaa	Don't give her the ring.|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	Get your $ back. If its over its over and your giving her this ring will make her think your trying to start something back up. If you can't get your $ back save it for the next hottie that will be using your heart as a doormat.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	if you need cash... sell the ring<br>  she wont be swayed back in your arms just because of a ring|`|S0UatyU3aa	give it to her
S4VVE0onaa	its not healthy and its illegal it can also cause many disorders in children born to parents of the same blood|`|Y2sDswLBaa	That it is wrong and should not happen.....|`|uTNKfpV6aa	It's disgusting. It causes physical disabilities, it causes health problems and it's just weird and wrong. It doesn't do anything positive, it just f--ks up the human race! It is the fastest way to destroy the human race, and leave the world as empty as we found it. If not, the inbreeding could cause mutations, and we can all come out looking like the flesh eating zombies from 28 Weeks Later.|`|fqboOITjaa	WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG!..........unless they're very hot ;)
jzpKHdjsaa	You don't have to set date, time, and place, but you can always say that you would like to see her again, and then set up the details in the next day or 2

B1sT1t44aa	Live like an average person for awhile and when the right woman comes along and you marry her then bring out your fortune for the two of you to share and have a great life together.|`|NgUbzaF9aa	Why not worry about that when you actually are rich.<br>  If you're poor or rich I don't think a woman who loved you would care. After all, the woman isn't in love with your money. If you're still a caring, understanding, charming person with love to give in return, it won't matter.<br>  <br>  It would be better, when meeting women to not tell them that you're rich. If that's possible at all.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	Don't brag about how much money you have.  Drive a car that isn't quite so noticeable.  Once you find your true love, you can buy whatever you want.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Sadly it will be harder.  The easiest way to find true love when you have money is not to flaunt it.  Say drive a nice car, but not a Bentley.  See?  Just don't advertise, "hey I'm rich" and chances are the gold diggers won't catch on.  Most of them are stupid anyway.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	Here's a clue how about you don't tell any potential girlfriends that you're the hot young inventor of a multi-million dollar invention?  Then you'll know if they love you for you?!|`|7eaf5c689c77b9c042b4be96ab16b8abaa	You're screwed anyway you cut it.  No matter what they say, chicks want $$$.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	If I was a guy and I was really rich, I would continue to live normally. Don't change anything, and try not to tell anyone. Save your money, or buy a vacation house somewhere far away to have your hot sex with hotties. Go there and show off your wealth, be normal at home. That way, when you meet a nice girl, you will know that she likes you for you before telling her that you are actually super wealthy. She will be overjoyed, and you will know for sure that she is genuine.|`|T272vObnaa	Among the other advice of not flashing your money, try not to have a complex that every woman you meet automatically wants you for your money.  Don't push women away due to paranoia that you're only good for your money.  Remember your redeeming qualities minus the money.  And besides, gold-diggers are fairly obvious, you should be able to spot them a mile away and tell them to eff off.|`|gjaPNWbTaa	If it's true, the best thing to do is continue living a modest life until you find the woman you want to marry.|`|fnBPI4OAaa	Just don't brag. And don't spend too much on the first few dates. Meet girls at "not-rich" spots. Do tests to she that she doesn't WANT you to spend money on her.|`|tZkHHy5jaa	Rich men can find good women if they are looking for them correctly.
M2dr9Ykzaa	I dont know what it means, but if you asked him and he didnt tell you then DO NOT let him bring a bunch of friends over. It sounds like it might be something sexual and I dont think that you want to be put into a situation with a bunch of guys and only you. In that case, i would recommend that you dump him. Sorry, it just doesnt sound right to me.Good luck and remeber to ask him what it means, otherwise,you might find yourself in an uncomfortable situation! :S<br>  good luck|`|DsK9lyt7aa	well that means they tape a bag over your face and tag team you.. its awesome, trust me you should do it...i once almost killed a girl. it still turns me on thinking about how her face turned purple.|`|rPT4J5YLaa	Anything that includes do you is something sexual Dump him and Run!|`|W0qFAIVuaa	If you are serious and want the meaning e-mail me.It is not very kind.If you are kidding can I be in.
5OVXO4lNaa	yes you're still a virgin until u get your cherry popped|`|uBssj3Znaa	nope ... once you have had a penis in you, you are no longer a virgin|`|O97IVzIhaa	Afraid not.  I don't know why he would want to do it anally anyway thats just nasty.|`|CtJeNwu8aa	It's until your cherry is popped in my opnion. It's what you think is right. And screw you guys who don't like anal it feels so damn good and tight! I did this chick in the *** all the time so she'd remain a virgin. Just be careful, use lube, and hope he doesn't give you a pink sock!|`|9fEeteY0aa	"A virgin (or maiden) is, originally, a young woman characterized by absence of sexual experience"<br>  <br>  Sounds like sexual experience to me, so no.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	nope.|`|G0mtkuDvaa	oh god you are nasty and why would you want it up there man i'm a guy and mine ain't going anywhere near any girls
rjsfiWt9aa	yeah if you like him, i would text him, he obviously wants to hang out if he went through that trouble. Although he may not be acting to forward because he doesnt know if you really like him, he may not want to do allll of the work. Go ahead and text him
WP36jh6Zaa	nope. dnt. itll cause major problems between u n urfriend.. unless u cud care less about her or the friendship. cuz shell prolly nvr speak to u again|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Of course you should date him if that's what you want.  The moment they broke up he was a free agent.  If you talk to your friend, she will probably tell you all the bad stuff about him.  Go for it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|BlMfOIBCaa	No you shouldn't date him. There is a code that you go by when you have a best friend, you never date a best friend bf or a best friend ex-bf.You should never break the code because once you do you have just broken up you friendship.
e98RKB35aa	It might have been someones laundry got mixed with his. Just watch him. Spend every waking hour with him. Just in a nice way just get out of him where he is going or up to. Just watch him, he might really not know.|`|FAQnVhH9aa	the only thing I can think of is that maybe he has a fetish.. cross dressing. I know that sounds like a joke but seriously he'd be to embarrassed to tell you. OR if you're sure that's not the case then he probably cheated. talk it out and trust your gut on whether to trust him or not.|`|gbCBo6ZDaa	well i think that it could be anybodys. i mean you do share washers and driers  so he could have accidently grabbed it thinking that it was yours. i wouldnt sweat over it. if you dont think that he did anything then he prolly didnt.|`|6fa2568b75c06da2670c61858c9441ceaa	It might have just been left in there by someone else. I sometimes forget clothes in the dryer, especially if its communal.|`|jzpKHdjsaa	It could have been stuck in the washer from a previous user...maybe...|`|L0Hz227xaa	Yea i would be pissed! Well first off do you trust him? You have to consider that. Next did you ask him where he thinks it may have came from? Make sure to pay attention to his responses and actions toward you. If he gets mad, thats a huge sign he may have done something wrong (guilty consience). Next, do you think he is that stupid to let a chick leave her clothes at your apartment? If you love him, i would let it go and just keep your eyes and ears open for any other signs of cheating. If this is something that has happened before or you have had other ideas that he may have been cheating, then listen to your mind. I think it may just be a mix up in the laundry based on what your telling me but again dont be a fool and not keep your eyes open. GOOD LUCK.
NxBYuOzbaa	4 years is a very long time to be mad. He's a jerk. Take it to heart. Walk away.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	I think he acts like that because he's mental.  You need to get rid of him ASAP!  No one deserves to be treated like that.  You deserve much MUCH better.  Dump him and find someone who will treat you right and love you the way you should be.<br>  <br>  Hops this helps, find a new guy...PLEASE!|`|C9QQPROkaa	How could you take that for 4 years of that honeyyyyyyy. That's not being mad or joking he REALLY does not care about you at all. I had a guy like that once and trust me he IS NOT going to change so if that's why you're in it leave now. You cannot stay with a guy like that unless you constantly want to have your feelings hurt and you don't want that to lead to physical abuse either.|`|BDjBVdtRaa	You need to break up with him. He doesn't even care about you at all!
QHnS31Scaa	no he wants you hes just nervous<br>  but ask him if your ever gunna date
AA11309717	he probably does think that. take your g/f with you and tell him what happened.
q2POh1dEaa	hell yeah man.<br>  <br>  nothing good comes out of face to face talks like that.<br>  <br>  be prepared.

It's just that women tend to have this some kinda lovey-dovey imagination in their minds of what their relationship should be. All these imaginations lead up to us falling in love with those perfect guys as portrayed by the media (why?because they fulfill our standard of what quality our guy should possess,of course).<br>  <br>  Most women might not openly admit it,but we know deep down there we always have our very own standards in men that some are almost impossible to be achieve.<br>  <br>  Hon,wut you should do is start enjoying your life with real man.<br>  Stop comparing everything your guy did with any character associated above. Try not to be judgmental,this will likely to increase your frustration in guys,thus leaving you pining over those dudes, again... But if it doesn't hurt you (and you didn't end up like some kind of crazy fan),i guess it's ok,ryte?<br>  <br>  after all,it's like having a secret lover to vent up our angst towards the mankind|`|GkPeIQ9Maa	Why talk in terms of Normal?<br>  <br>  Whats Really Normal..<br>  <br>  You Accepting of your own fantasies is Normal and Healthy..|`|cOBsDBgqaa	ok nathan scott from ONE TREE HILL?!<br>  omg you need to find someone quick!!!<br>  try real people that you can actually have a chance with.|`|EqG8KMQOaa	Eharmony.com, at least there are real people there.
CktiV6KJaa	Short guys are fine. I'm a short girls myself at 5'3.<br>  <br>  I just automatically assume short guys resent short girls. The taller guys are always much nicer to me. But this is just my personal outlook.|`|SyHmExgtaa	I can see how you would feel that way because you didn't choose your height anymore than a tall guy chose his but it is all based on individual attraction so if a girl isn't into short guys just move on because I'm sure you have things that you like and don't like when you look at females and that is your choice just like it is theirs..Just remember that you can't change the opinions of others so just focus on you and what makes you happy...Best Wishes...
52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	You say, "No".  It is a very simple sentence and it conveys a complete thought.|`|cI19nesraa	Two letter word: NO!  If he persists call his wife.  This is bad medicine that you don't need in your life.|`|jXD8eBFgaa	Date him ,make him pay for everything,then tell his wife .Have fun doing it|`|GkPeIQ9Maa	Girly..<br>  <br>  Have Complete Respect For Yourself And Other Women..<br>  <br>  Respect For Yourself That You Don't Want Tp Be A Sloppy Second..<br>  <br>  Respect For Other Women That You Would Never Want To Be The Wife Of The Cheating Man..<br>  <br>  Tell Him In Simple Words..

If he can't commit to his wife - he won't commit to you.
tIez5HWBaa	your very lucky, she must really love you, she realizes that you made a mistake and wants to try to make things right.<br>  <br>  However she may not trust you again, on the bright side, you coming clean was a good choice, it sends a message to her saying that you messed up real bad and want to try to fix things.<br>  <br>  cheating is always bad and always complicated, good luck|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	jerkkkkkk omg . maybe she wants to talk or something or kick your *** lol|`|SweWC8p1aa	because she probably still wants to make it work.|`|PK5Elowdaa	Good. I hope that *** is worth it. Considering you cheated on her, thats  one favor for me. My girl just cheated on me so thanks for evening out the scores. Believe it or not, females cheat more. <br>  <br>  Anyways back to your question. She still wants to see you on spring break? I'd be careful with that. She could possibly be sharpening her machete as we speak.|`|PxLhryHyaa	Maybe she wants to talk it over with you. Maybe she wants to forgive you because she cares for you that much. Maybe she wants closure of some sort? It could be anything really.....ask her! lol|`|CS6lcyBpaa	Too take you into a dark ale and kill you.|`|2aE0BxfFaa	I seen this in a movie. Don't go!

t7jiSmjVaa	Dude,this is what it would be like if you married the ********* . So if you have a problem with it now then call it quits and walk away now.  I bet you live at her place but she doesn't complain about having to clean up your  s h i t .|`|QcbgIBghaa	no its not ur responsibility...you got a life 2...just tell her about it, her friends could take her, her mom could drive i mean seriously they can make an effort once in a while, not just you...your not married!|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	No, you're not wrong.  These are  big responsibilities.  Kids are a lot of work and it is unfair of her to turn you into an instant dad at this time.|`|WZe1D2jaaa	No you aren't wrong for feeling that way. Talk to her about it and set some boundaries. That is, if you feel like staying in the relationship.|`|6286059824182c4e7ff0e287e5969887aa	Yeah it's a bit too much. You should evaluate if she really loves you and if she's interested in you for something other than rides. She probably likes you but you should talk to her about it but please...always mention how you love her daughter so she won't jump to wrong conclusions. Good luck...and remember one thing...there's nothing sexier than a soccer mom ;)|`|EayT8T5Gaa	AWWW HOW KIND ARE, BUT HEY SHES A SINGLE MOM AND SHE HAS HER OWN APPT, CMON NOW I BET YOU, YOU BE STAYIN THERE TO, BUT WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN WITH HER AND TALK TO HER ABOUT THE SITUATION MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY TELLING HER THAT YOU NEED YOU'RE SPACE AND YOU'RE OWN TIME TO YURSELF, JUST TALK TO HER AND BE LIKE YOU'RE PUTTIN TO MUCH WEIGHT ON MY SHOULDER WHEN ITS NOT EVEN MY KID. BUT DON'T SOUND TO DISRESPECTFUL.|`|6BlEjLZAaa	Naa you are not wrong and i couldnt do it myself , im 22 and it might sound harsh but i would never have a relationship with a girl who has a baby from another man ......well not at the age i am now. maybe you need to have some time to yourself|`|ZpDUQhu2aa	No, it's fine to feel like that. Just talk to her about it. If she understands, great, if she doesn't then you probabaly need to have a think about the relationship.|`|T5S7gnUlaa	The pussy just aint the same after kids, and kids are a hassle and what single male would go for ***** with baggage
71EwzPSlaa	um....if he wants time to get his head straight then you guys are broken up...basically what hes wanting out of you is to wait for him and then hell do whatever he wants while hes "getting his head right" and then when hes bored hell come back to you ....dont wait forever if its legit then wait but if hes just doing it to get with some other chicks then you need to move on|`|112aa4d1238ca81c154d56b623aec1dcaa	Well I agree with him in some ways.  I love my man, but I have to focus on work - if I think of him all the time I can't think of work. <br>  <br>  So, when he started saying don't phone or text if yr not going to help me.  In a way he was helping me out because it meant I could have a break from him without finishing with him.  I said ok I am NOT going to help you out.  So that meant I gave myself permission not to constantly phone & text.  But I do still love him.<br>  <br>  You can give him the space he requires & carry on loving him or you can go crazy & say it's finished just because he can't give you attention the whole time.  Your choice but it doesn't mean he doesn't love you and it doesn't mean he's finished with you.<br>  <br>  People that say it does are over reacting & maybe they just like to leap from person to person. That's up to them.  <br>  <br>  So what do you want to do now...................................|`|0q5Z5zxIaa	if he's your ex-boyfriend then surely haven't you broken up? i suggest that you just give him some space and get on with other things in your life. if he really isn't leaving you then he'll let you know and you can make a decision from there.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)
grPckwSsaa	i do know<br>  <br>  i know that when i find it, ill know that i want it|`|8j7FCEOraa	Not really.<br>  <br>  We figure it out eventually!|`|r2bbLMUZaa	Oh yes they do, but the complexity of the thing they want is so great that attempting to explain it to us men would cause instant stroke.<br>  <br>  Thus, to protect us, they try to edge us in the right direction with vague and (seemingly) conflicting sentences.|`|5ZwuIVPdaa	most of the time...i dont think they do..... like they want a good man but at the same time are with a hot guy that is mean to them and even hits them at times.. I got it!!! they want a hot boyfriend!!!|`|2aE0BxfFaa	No. They all want this perfect guy who is like their fantasy guy. Then they find a guy and and he doesn't meet their fantasy standards and they get fustrated. Even though he probably is the right guy.|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	They'll realise it when its tooo late and thus lose the person they really after|`|AA12199727	What they say they want and what they really want will always be two completely different things|`|IjkJVJNCaa	yes i do. i know what i want out of life, work, my man etc
d8uJaLXYaa	If he knows you don't like that, he shouldn't have asked. Has he said he's going whether you want him to or not? He really needs to listen to what you're saying; I hate all that Open Relationship stuff, too, so I know where you're coming from.<br>  Tell him firmly that you don't want to go, and you don't want him to go either.<br>  If he doesn't listen to you, he's not respecting you at all, so I'd say the relationship needs a re-think.<br>  Sorry =/<br>  Good luck <3<br>  Also, you do not seem closed-minded at all. Just because you actually see the value of a 2-person relationship? You sound down to earth to me.|`|KcK8W40faa	tell him noo.. and if he gives u problems.. maybe hes just not right...<br>  tell him that ur uncomfortable with him going.. just tell him the truth and what ur feeling and why<br>  if he really wants to stay with you he'll listen and understand why you think that...|`|YlBLz9lTaa	tell him no thats pretty much him trying to get permission to cheat|`|d057d4b205afdf38f32252a846ee418baa	yes|`|d1a7edebc33c3995ba43b888a1d936abaa	yes you should tell him that|`|8j7FCEOraa	I dont think its closed minded, some people just aren't into that<br>  If your boyfriend is pressuring you into doing things you dont want to do, and doesn't have enough respect for you to not go, or to be honest with you; Then Why are with Him?! He sounds like a total jerk!|`|grPckwSsaa	just tell him you arent into that sort of thing... a lot of people arent|`|eVK2zZsOaa	Yes you should tell him and if he cares about you and the relationship he will respect your request. I personally wouldn't even continue a relationship with somebody who was even considering doing something like that but it is your call. If he is into that and you aren't maybe you need to really think about if the two of you are right for each other. It sounds like he wants to take the relationship somewhere that you aren't willing to go and that is major grounds for a break up.|`|PY160XO7aa	YES and FIND ANOTHER|`|AA11447210	First off, yes. Why wouldn't you tell him?<br>  <br>  Next, most clubs are off premise (meaning sex doesn't occur at the club).<br>  <br>  Also, a lot of couples that go, do so to flirt and dance and maybe do a bit of touching, but don't do anything sexual with others. They just like the atmosphere and open-mindedness of the types of people in the lifestyle. <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend may not realize that in general, men unaccompanied by women aren't allowed in most swinger's clubs (unless they are good friends with the management or a highly valued couple who will vouch for them).<br>  <br>  I've had fun going to those types of clubs, when no sex occured (between my partner and I, and others). It's just a fun, sexy, atmosphere and can get a couple really wound up to have some fun of their own when they get home.<br>  <br>  However, if you aren't interested then tell him so. You are not obligated to want to share your partner with others sexually, or to even go to a club where others are doing that (even if you don't). It's not necessarily closed minded, it's your preference and your comfort zone.<br>  <br>  If you two can't communicate about things like this, and come to a mutual agreement about what will occur, then why are you together?|`|mZlPj8Guaa	He has issues. And not digging you is one of them.<br>  <br>  If he is not into you, then why bother with him?<br>  <br>  Hate to be blunt, but dump the Bloke.|`|PK5Elowdaa	I went to one in San Francisco. Its not what you think. Its optional. You won't have to feel obligated. You can either stand around and look at other couples or just enjoy them music. Wasn't my thing but I did watch. Didn't even turn me on. Well the girl that came up to me and rubbed her breast against me sorta did but in all,  it was a unique experience. <br>  <br>  I say go and see for yourself. Your boyfriend should make you feel protected and not obligated to join. Hey, its a free show!|`|4DDSD9Syaa	You need to drop him. Cause that is what his interest is and not yours and it will never work. Not sure if he is willing to give it up. Doesn't look like it. You need to be straight up with him and tell him that you are NOT into a swingers club and never will be. The end. Then you make your decision from there. Be miserable or move on and be happy not worried about who your man will be sleeping with.|`|Dw4jXVnHaa	If your not into it tell him, and I hope this isn't a new development I mean seriously why are you dating him without knowing these things and or allowing them to happen since the get go.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Dump him and move on before you get some kind of venereal disease.|`|JRRsjByCaa	if he wants to go to a swingers club obviously he wants more than just you. get rid of him.|`|l2iqJbZKaa	Either leave him or tell him straight up.

Several ways...<br>  <br>  Best: Just deal with it. before you know it, you'll be ungrounded.<br>  <br>  Better: Try to make up for it, maybe do a few extra chores, wash their cars or things like that.

But, you need to set a limit on that time for yourself. No sense in leaving you hanging high and dry. It's not fair to you. So, you need to figure out how long you are willing H wait on his decision of wether he wants to be married or not. You need to get your affairs in order and make sure you can make it financially on your own. Take care of yourself first. Because if he chooses not to come back, you will still have to be able to support yourself. Do not call anymore. Let him make that first move. And why in the hell would he have his mother call you? Is he that much of a momma's boy and coward that he can't tell you this himself? That's not fair to you no matter what type of problems you had in the marriage.

That's one thing you don't have to worry about, because you two have already met.  Congratulations!<br>  <br>  You also say the girl knows you like her. Good! That's Step Two. You don't have to work at impressing her or getting her attention.<br>  <br>  The last step is Step Three, which is actually doing the asking, so you're almost there. . . .<br>  <br>  Here's your clue and suggestion:<br>  Whatever it is you two talk about, now, I assume, must not be very personal in nature but rather superficial, like, about homework, teachers, cafeteria lunches, or the new president. You need to make your conversations more personal. For instance, if you talk about homework, tell her how you do your homework while listening to music.  If it's about a teacher, tell her how you think the one teacher seems to have a lot of patience with you because you just can't seem to frasp that algebra. And if it's about cafeteria lunches, tell how you wish they had more choices because you would like to lower your caloric intake. The new president? Maybe tell her how you're glad he's not you because all those problems the president  instantly was confronted with, would have made you a nervous wreck! (These are just ideas)<br>  <br>  Once you learn to converse in a more personal manner, the asking for a date thing will become much easier to slip into the conversation.<br>  <br>  Good luck cause you're almost there!|`|iGxEExUhaa	Take a look in the mirror and try to boost you confidence yourself before hand.

150esu4Daa	First off, I'm very sorry for everything that your mother put you through, you deserved better! I can somewhat relate, my parents were abusive alcoholics who got sober some years after I moved out. Regardless of what you decide to do you need to remember that this woman is not a mother in the same sense that you are to your child. You are a mother, she is just a person who gave birth to you. Any relationship that you choose to have with her now cannot be a mother/daughter relationship. There is just too much damage there and it doesn't sound like she ever had that kind of relationship with you when you were growing up. <br>  <br>  I understand that you feel like you can't trust her, but you don't need to. You have done fine without her and you don't need the same level of trust from her that you needed as a child. You don't need to have a full blown relationship with her. Maybe start with regular phone calls, then maybe casual meetings. Make sure you are comfortable at the pace the relationship is progressing. I do think you should at least try talking with her, you must have a lot of anger and pain associated with her (I would) and it would be good for you to meet with her and kind of deal with it in a sense. Good luck sweetie!|`|RPa1LhNqaa	give her a chance shes ur mom|`|3FmO9ACaaa	you have to understand that drugs take over and if she has been clean for a year then suport as much you can so she doesnt think this is a waste of time and go back to it. but i do agree you need to keep a safe distance so write her a letter once in a while or phone her, and if you do meet be in the public eye so you no you can just walk away.|`|gtunOva2aa	That's a tough one. On one hand, she's your mother, on the other, she's put you through a lot of stuff you shouldn't have had to go through, I personally would stay away, if not for your mental health, then for your child. Do you want you toddler to grow up seeing grandma like that? (Though, it could keep him or her off drugs when they grow up.) I would say that it's really your call.|`|AA11207703	I totally hear what your saying. I think going back in time just depresses you, and who wouldn't feel the same way. I wouldn't jump at the idea of seeing your mom right away, at least until some time has passed, and she has been clean for a very long time (yrs.) Yes its a sad situation but now you have a family to think about and anyone would want to be cautious exposing them to this drug problem. I can imagine in the passed while growing up, it must have pretty much destroyed you as a person. Its your call now, but don't feel the least bit guilty because its your mother. You must have all kinds of resentment built up inside of you because of the passed. Talk with a professional person on this and take it from there. Good Luck|`|Ww7CyyALaa	My father was a druggie as well when i was younger and i told myself i would never talk to him again because of what he put us through. But you just have to remember everyone make mistakes, some people just make bigger mistakes than the rest of us. And let your mother know that you will only talk to her if she is clean and everything should work out eventually... Make sure if you do decide to start talking with your mother again that she knows what you are ok with and not ok with, since like you said you haven't spoken in a while i am pretty sure you have changed and she won't know that unless you tell her

Obviously, it'll be for a booty call or better yet a one night stand.<br>  <br>  To find the person to spend the rest of your life with could be in a book store, church, mall, ect.

I think there are a lot of people that do just go to the bar looking for a one night-er but there are others that are just out to have fun. When I go it is never to look for a guy, it is just to get out with friends and let loose.<br>  <br>  Just be cautious if you meet someone that "everyone knows there name", then they apparently don't look for new and different things to do and just may have a drinking problem or are just a flat out player.|`|AA10950966	There is no answer to this. Whether you believe in God or not, you can meet them anywhere. If you follow religion, then chances were that you were fated to go there and meet them, if not religious, then encountering anyone anywhere is a big deal, for your life partner that is. A bar, a school, a library, it doesn't matter where, as long as it happens.|`|T272vObnaa	I did.  However, I do think it's rather unusual.  People in bars usually are young people looking to party, or older people who are lonely and just need some social interaction.  Even though I met my husband in a bar, I wouldn't recommend it as a prime location.  I had to weed through 99.9% losers to find him, and I think it was pure dumb luck that we hooked up.  But, stranger things have happened, I'm sure.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Unlikely. Most men who hang out in bars are not looking for a life partner but looking for fun.... They tend to just want casual sex. There are better places to look for a life partner. A new hobby might be a good idea.|`|6gPCA7jHaa	Sounds more like a one night stand partner.

m7VMwAplaa	You should absolutely be trying dresses on in the store. There's no way to know what will look good until you try on every style (not to mention the fact that you're wedding is in 5-6 months and you haven't even starting shopping, you really should be buying now!) The dress can take a few months to come in and then you'll need alterations done. <br>  <br>  BUT with that said.. I suggest a A line - they look GREAT on hourglass figures. <br>  <br>  examples: <a href="http://www.sotteroandmidgley.com/dress.aspx?keywordText=A-line&keywordType=exact&page=0&pageSize=12&style=ASM3297" rel="nofollow">http://www.sotteroandmidgley.com/dress.a...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.sotteroandmidgley.com/dress.aspx?keywordText=A-line&keywordType=exact&pageSize=12&page=1&style=JSM1244" rel="nofollow">http://www.sotteroandmidgley.com/dress.a...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?keywordText=A-line&keywordType=exact&pageSize=12&page=1&style=JD1233" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a> <br>  (sorry I don't know your style, these are just EXAMPLES of a formal A-line)|`|EHQCkDaqaa	The best thing to do is to make an appointment and try some dresses on.. I am 5'9 and 170 lbs.. not fat, but lots of muscle & curves. For me, I found that the most flattering dresses were the strapless ones.. and stay away from the mermaid/fitted dresses. The dresses I liked the most had a high waisted band or ribbon around them, I found it made it really slimming. Check out these dress links:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?langId=-1&catalogId=10001&storeId=10052&catentryId=1000381" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a><br>  <br>  and here's my dress.. i found it online for half the price i found it at in the store:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?langId=-1&catalogId=10001&storeId=10052&catentryId=1000094" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/s...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

Stay away from anything that has puffy sleeves or anything that accentuates the shoulders. Things like puffy sleeves or bows or flowers on the shoulders make them look bigger. <br>  <br>  Also, with a curvy shape, you may not want something that cinches at the waist line too tightly. This may give your rear a larger appearance than you are comfortable with. Something that has a smooth transition from top to bottom will show off curves, but still hide any imperfections you feel that you have.<br>  <br>  With a curvy figure, try to stay away from anything that cinches just under the bust. These dress types will sometimes give the wearer a pot belly look, and won't show off your pretty curves.<br>  <br>  I hope these suggestions will help. Best wishes.|`|b06d2752947c332133b3d703ba6e1c3faa	I think the strapless dresses make a big bust look even bigger, and I think they tend to make the upper body look larger in general. I'm a 40DD and the strapless gowns made me look positively bovine. <br>  <br>  If you look at women with hourglass figures in the past, you'll notice they wear a lot of halter top style dresses. Think Marilyn Monroe in that white dress over the heater vent. <br>  <br>  I linked one for ya, sort of what I'm talking about. Has enough coverage up top but not too much, and the smaller waist with the moderate flared bottom accentuates the hourglass shape while hiding any problems you might think you have, like big thighs or hips or whatever.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	im almost the same as you are. im 5'3 and 140. i find that strapless dresses look best on be, and ones with pickups on the bottom. liek this:<br>  <a href="http://davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplayView?storeId=10052&catalogId=10051&categoryId=-49995498&currentIdx=72&subCategory=-49999486%7c-49995498&catentryId=1000195" rel="nofollow">http://davidsbridal.com/webapp/wcs/store...</a><br>  i tried that one on at the store and it looked really good on me. it made my waste look small and it was so prettty. i dont have the pic of me in it anymore, i dont know where it went, but go to davids bridal and just start trying things on. the people that help you usually know what looks good on certian body types. also when you look at the link scroll down to the bottom and people have pics of them trying the dress on, so you can see how it looks on different woman. i ultimately didnt pick it because if fell in love with this dress:<br>  <a href="http://i43.tinypic.com/14ie61w.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i43.tinypic.com/14ie61w.jpg</a><br>  <br>  good luck!|`|kfgx4PjUaa	Hi I am not sure where you are located, but try this link.

1F6KJt0oaa	She is into you because you are mad at her.  Meet her for drinks meet her away from the bar.  Meet her at your place (probably won't be as hard as you think) and that is it.  Don't over plan it, don't over think it, and don't rush it.  If you aren't into her then move on.  If you are then wait it out.  Sounds like you don't so much like her as you want to bed her as soon as possible which isn't really the foundation of anything worth her time.  If you aren't willing to give her time to really get out of that last relationship which even if she left him she isn't fully out yet sounds like then you don't care about her you care about curves.  She likes you but she can see that you are pretty much just the same road with different scenery.|`|jfwmelYgaa	Nope...you should go after her, but then again her old b/f may become jealous and kick your ***, and he may be part of a gang, and then you would have a gang after you, I still say go for it though.|`|5sCpMpbWaa	yeah defo make a move.!|`|oA8fEliTaa	well if you really like her take her out but dont let her use you ,even just have a bit of fun and maybe not take things so seriously <br>  xxxxxxxxxxxx|`|cL05NtA3aa	keep staying friends for a while till she is ready then you'll know when to make your move...gud luck!!!|`|6yXlP6kfaa	move on|`|Q2idNMmLaa	Well maybe you need to give her some time if she just broke up with her boyfriend.<br>  And try to spend as much time with her as possible, and drop a few hints that you like her, and hopefully she will come to you when she's ready, but you need to let her know that your not going to hurt her.<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope everything works out for you!(:|`|NXJDsVfNaa	She needs her space after a tough break up. Give it to her. <br>  She clearly likes you a little bit, but she can't handel it now. <br>  <br>  Move on. If she wants you, then she will come to you. But don't waste your time waiting. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|cJXUFV59aa	stop being so dramatic! stop getting mad at her! she seems sweet, and just got out of a relationship. be patient, and maybe things will work out :)|`|WU7xMQCyaa	Only move on it there is no chance, you never know what could happen if you don't.|`|KcK8W40faa	wasn't this already a question?<br>  move on dude
Ww7CyyALaa	I had the same problem, and grounding her isn't going to do anything i was grounded for a year straight and i still barley passed freshman year<br>  <br>  <br>  so the thing to do is have her put sticky notes everywhere reminding her what she needs to do like after you are sure its in her backpack make sure she has a sticky note on her binder saying don't for get to turn in __________ assignment|`|qNJVn6N4aa	I would sit with her and take away some privileges.  She is old enough to take responsibility.  Parents cant always spoon feed their children.  Put your foot down and let her know that until she takes responsibility, some strict changes will have to be made.|`|m8iMAPueaa	Smack her!|`|kcSZ03TLaa	maybe she has a little ADD|`|4WlkDzLeaa	You can ground her all you want but if she has absolutely no interest in the subjects or in doing well in school then she will never find the right motivation to hand in her work and organize herself. <br>  <br>  I was like her a few years ago but I suddenly wanted a successful future and realized that I had to get my act together and do well in school and get organized. Have a talk with her about what she wants for her future, what kind of career etc. and then see how you can change her habits for the better.<br>  <br>  Tell her organization isn't just about not flunking school but it's really important for anything she will want to do in life and the sooner she starts learning that the better! Take it easy and treat her as an adult and hopefully she will realize that high schooll is something you have to just grin and bare and you might as well try and do well!<br>  <br>  Good luck, and write me if you need any more help!|`|tG61PaHqaa	color coordinate. <br>  like all blue binders, folders, pen for math<br>  red for history.<br>  green for science.<br>  and she can write her name with a pen if it has to be done in pencil. <br>  it worked for me!|`|c2faaed487e37842ff3532bde2bc56a7aa	wow...<br>  Okie I'm 14 and I'm very organized. I think it's because the consequences were so great when I was a kid that I just grew up putting everything back in it's place...and now it's pretty natural to me. <br>  <br>  When I say "consequences were so great" I mean ...teachers NEVER let us turn stuff in late, you just got a 0. My dad would yell about the messy room...like all parents do..and would force my to clean mine...AND the living room since I already have the vacuum started >.><br>  <br>  So your question is what to do. She's 14, TALK TO HER...from a caring parent perspective, not from controlling/nagging mother way.. Give her some advice. Buy her a planner with a calender *although most schools give students one* tell her to use it! <br>  For example: On the weekends I get a whole hell of a lot of homework/projects. I make a list and plan how I'll do it in consideration to when's it's due. <br>  Try to establish some sort of routine. Before I go to bed everything is already in my book bag for the morning *I'd freak out if I had to pack my bag at 5:30 am lol* , except for maybe some notes I was studying. Just so I don't forget it I put right by my bed so I see it when I wake up. <br>  <br>  About the algebra thing..are you sure it's just about the turning in assignments late? Talk to her teacher, talk to her. Work with her. Maybe she needs more work in Algebra. <br>  <br>  Ultimately it's about your daughter being more independent and successful, you can only guide her.
tIez5HWBaa	I hate to say this, but if you really truly love her, than you will never get over it, thats the point of love, its a feeling that never goes away, and if it does it means you never really loved her in the first place.<br>  <br>  it may never go away, but you can still move on, look for someone else, find a new interest, even if its not a serious one, just find someone to let you move your mind to somthing new|`|2fW267GMaa	It sounds to me you aren't ready to be her friend.  It takes time before you can be friends with an ex again if you ever can.  Some people are able to brush off the past easier then others.  Personally I couldn't be friends with someone that dumped me.<br>  <br>  If you continue to hang around her then it will just be reopening old wounds.  Eventually she is going to be with someone else and then how will you feel?  You don't have to be rude about it but explain to her that you still have feelings and respect the fact that she doesn't.  Tell her you can't be in contact with her at least for the time being.<br>  <br>  Now you move on by doing things to take your mind off of her which is much easier when you aren't in contact.  It will take time but eventually the pain will go away.  You will meet someone new someday so don't fret.  Everyone deals with this and its a very tough but needed life lesson.  It will make you stronger.|`|NgUbzaF9aa	What can you do except for lose the feelings you have for her. I had a similar situation in the past. With all due respect we weren't a couple, but I loved this person dearly, and when they didn't reciprocate, it was just the most awful feeling. Though, through the years, I've learned that not everyone I meet in my life will always have the same feelings for me.<br>  <br>  I do have a boyfriend now, who I've been going out with for 2 years. The man I did love, well, now I'm just hoping wherever he is, that he's doing okay. He was a really great person and all I can do is just wish him the best in his life. <br>  <br>  Losing feelings for someone isn't easy. Dare I say it's one of the most difficult things in life to get over. It may take some time, but if you choose at all to keep those feelings, then you will have to live with them for your entire life. So be careful, and just try to be happy for her.<br>  Try to be her friend, so that even though you aren't a couple, that you can still support her and love her; just on a platonic level.

Yes, you can stick around and hope that he changes. Sometimes it helps to let him be "very loud and angry" in order to let him express his frustrations. But this might help only if you are able to express your feelings of anger also. In other words, you would have a screamfest.<br>  <br>  Chances for change are minimal. So consider the options I have laid out.

Let him know you mean business, tell him you love him too much to sit and watch him kill himself. People are dieing everyday from problems associated with drinking. I have stood by and watched people pass bowel through there mouth because of there liver had been cooked by drinking. Perhaps he should go and visit some people that are dieing from cirrhosis of the liver. I assure you its not a nice situation to be in or to see a loved one in.

I can't tell other people how to live their lives, and I really don't like to judge people and tell them how I think they should live their lives.<br>  <br>  But in my life, for me, yes its necessary for ME to be married to the man that I am having children with.

And even being a single parent, if it's by choice, won't necessarily negatively affect the child. <br>  <br>  Marriage also isn't a guarantee of stability and support for children. If a couple gets married for the sole reason that they have a child together, it's often much worse for the child than if the parents had stayed separated and lived separate lives but still been equally involved in the child's life. I would know.. I was the reason my parents got married and my dad never let me forget I was the reason he didn't get to do what he wanted.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	Necessary? No, but it confuses me when someone can say "you are good enough to be a mother/father to my child and we will raise the child together for the next 18-21 years, but you aren't good enough to be my life partner...How can you think they are worthy of being a good parent, but not want them to be your spouse? I realize a lot of marriages don't work out, but at least they gave it a shot....|`|TczFL0p0aa	ABSOLUTELY NOT. in fact no one is ever 100% ready to raise a child. think about it if you asked someone at any point in life "are you ready to be fully responsible for another humans life and your own?" most people would say no. <br>  some however are more ready then others.<br>  but when your ready you'll know, you do not have to have a ring on your finger and some kinda license saying what ' i have a partner so i can raise this child and be responsible for everything it does for the rest of its life'.<br>  its no ones decision but your own.|`|14929d050f0d4920cb09fe344ab094b9aa	I think it is necessary, and in the olden days you would never get pregant unless u were married. I like it that way. I don't have kids , I wanna have them when I'm married. But, it doesn not mean than when you are married you must have children. Dont have kids when u are not married, but when you are married you don't necessarly have to have kids.|`|EJubUoifaa	This is a personal question but I'm going to answer anyway. So this depends, if these parents are mature enough to own a child and stay together for the rest of their life's.  Now if they are a couple that always fight and always threaten to break up with each other than no.  So it really depends on what kind of couple you are. You have to have the patience to stay with your boyfriend/girlfriend. So if you have all of that with your couple then go ahead and have a child.|`|AA11315360	Yes. I would never have kids without getting married. It is trashy to have kids not married. I want my kids to have the same last name as me. And many insurance companies do NOT cover pregnancy if you are on a single plan. You have to get married to get on a family plan and have to do that BEFORE you get pregnant for the pregnancy medical care to be covered.|`|uVv8lsgxaa	Yes this way you have standards for your children so they are not fourteen and pregnant. Also this makes it harder for a man to back out of the situation. Not saying that he will but guys like to throw in the towel on things they don't have full control over! Good luck and I hope you make a wise decision!|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	Perhaps not necessary but it is a commitment to be true to the other person, and if the commitment is not there, then it is unwise to have children by  someone who isn't willing to make that commitment to you.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	no anyone canget pregnant. i do think it is smarter to be in a commited relationship and married with a stable place to live before having kids. it is just easier that way. Two parents are better then one.|`|AA12382198	I think it's a very very good idea.<br>  <br>  It shows the children their parents are legally committed to each other.<br>  <br>  2 of my daughter's friends thought  it was awesome that her parents are married....LOL|`|7edl5u1oaa	I believe it's 100% necessary!|`|wmOgseCgaa	We have two kids, been together nine years and still not married|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	Unless you want to raise bastards, I would think yes.|`|4POGapREaa	No I don't.  Of course women shouldn't be getting knocked up without any stability in their lives though.  I think it's fine for 2 adults to make a decision not to be married but still have kids.  Not to go all Hollywood on you, but Brad & Angelina aren't married and they seem to be fantastic parents & a truly happy couple who cherish their lives & their family.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	No but it is smarter than being a knocked up single gal.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	As Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears has noted, children born to unmarried women and to those in cohabiting relationships “must often overcome increased risks of poverty, education failure, child abuse, delinquency, emotional distress and mental illness.” <br>  <br>  A single woman’s income is part of the reason, but the lack of a father’s guidance in children’s lives is a major cause of their suffering. “Marriage is the best child welfare, crime prevention, anti-poverty program we have,” Sears said in that same speech.<br>  <br>  The focus of all law and public policies really should be reoriented to children. They desperately need protection from self-centered adults who casually create life for reasons that are frivolous and self-indulgent.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	If it were, our bodies wouldn't become able to reproduce until we said I do.  <br>  <br>  Marriage is a man-made institution.  Reproduction is inherent to our species.<br>  <br>  Children need parents who love them and are committed to them.  Marriage does not guarantee that will happen.  So no, marriage is not necessary to have children.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	I think biology works without that knowledge. It does make child rearing much easier. In today's society, people are more accepting of single parents and there are more mechanisms in place to accomplish the task.|`|7royFhIgaa	No But think about your kids future.
RKhSRMlZaa	Got married to a man with HORRIBLE credit and I had to take on all of our loans (2 car loans, etc).  It weighed on me heavily.  But it hasn't affected our marriage because I understand that he made mistakes in the past and is working as hard as he can to fix it.|`|MuVKeK8faa	My husband has perfect credit and no debt.  I made sure to do my research and studied his spending habits.  As far as how much money he made I didn't care..he just had to be responsible like me.  When your in a relationship..their money problems become YOUR money problems.  It was a lesson I had to learn from previous relationships.  Love is great but also you must consider their financial situation, health, habits, goals...everything! I mean your spending the rest of your life with this person...you dont' want to be miserable!|`|uVv8lsgxaa	Well that tells me that he is not a responsible father and you should question if you are the next baby momma drama who is fighting for child support?!?|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	i dont have that problem but i agree. i would wait until he catches up on his back child support.|`|wmOgseCgaa	I agree. My debt is 2000 and so is his, but we don't want to get married until it is all paid off.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	Yes, we went into our marriage with big dreams... only to find out that he owed 3,000 to the IRS, another 1300 in credit card debt.<br>  <br>  We got through it, but our bad credit has kept us from getting a home, or even a nice apartment, and I wish that he had taken care of his debts before we got married, and it started affecting me, too.|`|OKKfyLnlaa	My husband owes over $100,000 for school.  Paying off his loans each month costs more then our house.  I had no debt when I married him, and we still joke about how I could make it just fine without him, but he needs me.  It is a sore point sometimes, but if you really love someone you can make it work.  It is just money.|`|ByUS0k8waa	I don't think that marriage and debt have anything to do with each other. My friends and I make the joke that if we ever re marry we will check the credit score. Honestly if you love someone you don't care what their debt is. However not paying child support says something about him. I personally don't think I could be with anyone who doesn't find it important to pay for the child they created. Don't seem important that they are cheating the child. That says alot about the person he really is.
CM1dfztQaa	No, this is not rude. Inviting them is a way of letting these people know that you think enough of them to include them in your big day. Whether or not they can attend, they will be thrilled that you thought of them too.<br>  <br>  I had a friend who desided that because I moved to a different state, I wouldn't be able to attend her wedding. I was really hurt by this because I would have gone in a heart beat.|`|0Id85yiYaa	i think you should invite them. they should feel flattered that you thought of them. plus, there isn't anything that says that they have to give you a gift.<br>  <br>  help with mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Am7wVq3Mr9Kd4YZ8HnFhZ87sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220110931AALjkuZ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	it's never rude to INCLUDE someone.  It's a nice way of letting them know you were thinking of them and you never know, maybe some of them will surprise you and show up any way.|`|yQdA5rHnaa	it would be rude to EXCLUDE someone just because they can't attend.|`|l43NSgHyaa	Invite Them!!<br>  <br>  I'd like to meet the person who thought that sending an invitation to someone is rude.  You're right, sending an invite is polite and lets the other person know you're thinking about them and really wish they could come.  Like you, when I receive and invitation to a wedding, I'm flattered.   I would never view it as a way to get gifts, that's silly.<br>  <br>  Listen, I think your 85-year old friend would be beyond flattered to receive an invitation to a social event.   So, send one.    And, by no means, does it make you look like you're fishing for gifts.  That's absurd to even think that.|`|AA11380378	Meeooow<br>  <br>  Nowto answer your question, invite everyone that you want. I invited a dear friend of mine that was very ill with cancer, and another one that had recently went through a painful breakup and financial loss. They were very happy that I thought of them and extended the invitation to the wedding. I never expected a gift from them and they did call me and tell me that they were very happy that I thought of them.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AW1dCzH0aa	I have been invited to weddings where it was clear that I would be unable to attend.  It always made me feel honored that I was invited - I never felt like it was sent as an expectation for a gift.  Of course, I sent wedding gifts, but I would likely have gifted them anyway!  I think that it's important to honor all the people you care about by attempting to include them in your big day.  If they can't attend, it doesn't diminish your effort to make them apart of your wedding!|`|55zWUXcUaa	A friend of my fiance will be is Germany at the time of our wedding so we are getting his address in Germany from a family member of his and we are sending one to him there.  Even though her can't come we want him to know we wish he were here!  Send your friends the invites anyway I am sure they will happy to be included.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	You've got it right - YOUR FRIEND IS WRONG!<br>  Because you would want them there, you should invite them.  It is up to the invitee to accept or decline.  And who knows, perhaps the bull-herding woman likes you enough to make a special effort to attend your day?  YOU might be surprised!|`|sGP6s7uraa	They need an invitation regardless.  Like the first post; it's rude to exclude.|`|7efe69c2d9a0b4d3a0798d71a2f5ea43aa	I have an elderly aunt who is almost 90 years I had invited to my wedding a year and a half ago. I live in Idaho and she lives in New Jersey and I had a feeling she would not be able to attend. I sent her and invitation because I wanted her to know that I was getting married and I wanted her to share my joy and happiness. I was not expecting a gift from her. She was unable to attend, but she was so grateful that I had invited her and wanted to share something special and important with her.<br>   If I were you I would send her an invitation and if possible a picture of you and your fiance so she can see what you both look like together.|`|J5zj8dWRaa	While I personally find it obnoxious to have to buy presents for showers and weddings, even when I can't attend....  <br>  <br>  You were right to invite those people, anyway.  As you said, it makes people feel left out and unwanted otherwise.  Sending them an invite tells them how much they mean to you, and that you truly want them there - you aren't pretending not to be indifferent.  Don't completely count them out, though; they might pleasantly surprise you by finding the means to attend.<br>  <br>  Congrats to you and your fiance!|`|vtW3qPZmaa	I sent invites to my grandparents knowing full well they wouldn't be able to make it due to ill health (they're in the UK and the wedding's in Canada).  I added a handwritten note saying that I realised it was unlikely that they'd be able to make it, but wanted them to know that they were very much wanted and, although we completely understood that often circumstances are beyond our control, they would be missed if they were unable to attend.  I also did the same thing for an aunt & uncle who I knew wouldn't make it due to his extreme fear of flying.|`|80b3fd718cbac3bab6c1365ad47cd447aa	People will think of you as very kind for inviting them even though they won't be able to make it. I would appreciate it if someone I knew invited me to their wedding, even though I was not able to make it (I would feel bad at MYSELF for not being able to make it!!!). If they are not close to you, you probably won't get a gift from them, anyway.|`|wADnvKGFaa	Yes invite them!  They will be touched that you want to share this day with them.<br>  The only caution I can tell you is when you're working out the budget, don't assume that they wont come.  Make you're budget as though every single person on there will show up (cause the might!!)  Then you will more than enough.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Drw4Gg1Daa	I would invite them anyway.  It's the thought that counts.  One of my friends is due to have her baby a couple days before my wedding, but I'm still inviting her.|`|q8eue7CRaa	You're right! Your friend is wrong.|`|AA11315360	Invite people you want there. Dont assume they cant come. Some people will surprise you. My dad invited a man to my wedding that he assumed probably wouldnt come because the guy is sick and very old. However the guy DID send the reply back that he would come! (I didnt get married but all the invites and replies from my side had come back). The point is that some people my family and I assumed wouldnt come planned on coming!<br>  So just invite who you would really like to be there and they may surprise you and show up!|`|76nTvO4iaa	Your friend is WRONG.<br>  <br>  It's rude to assume that people can't or won't attend your wedding - they may surprise you and come!   Send them a complete invitation (including reception card and any inserts) and let them make the decision on whether to attend.<br>  <br>  Just remember how you felt!
jDT8yH7Raa	you did too much too soon.  i guess no one ever told you not to start anything you can't finish.  my husband has a bad habit of throwing his dirty clothes on the floor.  i never pick them up, but make him.  he has gotten into a pattern now of picking up his own clothes or not throwing them on the floor in the first place.  i might offend some, but men are like children.  if you teach them a pattern they will stick to it.  since the two of us where dating, he always took out the trash, washed the car and things like that, he is use to the pattern.  start slow but stick to your guns andd don't start nothing new you can't do for the rest of your life.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	I have the same situation and my husband has ADD so its even worse cuz he forgets and stuff. Talk about it and tell him that if you clean this, this and this and he has to clean this, this and this. I told my husband if i cook then you clean after and thats how it is with everything. i clean the kitchen he does the bathroom. good luck!|`|T272vObnaa	Yes.  My husband is so in his own world, he doesn't notice the trash overflowing or the dishes piling up, or all the junk he just leaves sitting around.  If I ask him, he will do things, I just sometimes wish he'd take the initiative, so I don't feel like he's my child or I'm nagging.|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	Relationships always seem to go this way.  You have to sit him down and talk to him about it seriously. If he doesn't want to listen just stop doing things that have to do with him.  Clean up after yourself and do your own laundry but let him do his own things.  He will learn real fast that you aren't playing around.  Just stick to your guns|`|kcSZ03TLaa	depends on what your role is. are you a stay at home-maker and don't work outside the home? if so...you take out the trash.|`|PN7XMglOaa	yeah , me .|`|ze7xiJwTaa	That's a toughie. I'm in the same boat. My partner doesn't seem to do anything unless I specifically ask him. I can't stand for things to be a mess and I hate fighting over it so I have always just done it. In my last marriage and current relationship this has been the biggest issue and I always come out sounding like a nag. I've never figured out the right way to approach it without pissing them off (which of course makes me so mad cuz I'm doing all the work). It sucks feeling taken for granted when you both have full time jobs or responsibilities and you are taking on all the house work. <br>  I have learned: don't wait till your frustration builds up to bring it up or it will turn into a fight and you will somehow end up the bad guy (no idea how that happens but it does). <br>  Try bring it up gently when you are in good moods, do it in a joking way if possible (my therapist says humor works great, but I can't seem to pull it off). <br>  If it causes fights for you, ask him how you can best approach the subject with him, so that you don't upset him. See what he comes back with (mine tells me that I have to assign him stuff, which I hate but at least it's working). <br>  Or if all else fails go with a job list. I know it sounds juvenile but it truly works. List out all the house chores. Sit down and agree to who gets what and hold each other accountable. <br>  Good luck, and no, you are definitely NOT alone :)|`|zL1sggpCaa	I asked my husband (when I had ENOUGH) that if he thought he had a good wife... he answered yes... I then asked why he is so selfish and lazy - we both work full time, we have two children and yet... all of the cleaning, cooking, errands, etc. all fell on my shoulders. Forget asking him to take the trash out or even putting his dishes from where he sat into the kitchen so at least when I wash them I didn't have to look all over the house.<br>  <br>  Bonus - I'm in physical therapy for my back, so doing things like sweeping and mopping, scrubbing the bathtub, etc... all hurts. And hurts for days. <br>  <br>  So, when I told him that I wasn't going to be a door mat any longer and he could either do his part around the house OR loose me... he said I was right, that he had been slefish and lazy... my mouth dropped!! I asked him why - and he explained that he knew that I would take care of it any way. He knows I'm a good wife and mom to our kids - so, if he didn't do it when I asked, he knew it wouldn't matter (other than me getting mad) because I would just do it if he didn't.<br>  <br>  I'm no longer doing it.... and he is starting to pitch in. Today for example, he put our patio furnature out, took a load of broken items to the dumpster and took the trash out. So, all I have to do tonight is hit the grocery store, pick up our children and then make dinner. :-) I think its getting towards being fair. :-)|`|VkzmH1GKaa	AMEN from a man's point of veiw and previous experience that really lets you know how someone feels about you doesn't it. I think your first step was correct stop. Hope it works out or you get out.|`|KWaTuVpqaa	I did do that for almost 2 years.  I tried to sit and talk with him, but nothing helped.  That situation on top of every other little thing really did our marriage in, and we got divorced.  <br>  <br>  I wish I had words of wisdom for you, but I don't.  All I can tell you is try and talk to him and understand his perspective, but don't forget to tell him that him not helping is making you feel like crap.  Hopefully he will see the light when he hears that it's making you feel the way you do.<br>  <br>  Good luck with it all.|`|e2099d20a6fdd2c84c032e222b17db4faa	After 13 years, my husband and I have established a pattern on things.  I do most of the housework, all laundry and finances.  He cooks and cleans the kitchen, does household maintenance, and takes care of the autos.  Together, we raise the children, shop for the houshold and do the little extras needing to be done.  <br>  <br>  It was not always like this, at the beginning, I performed all household chores and took care of the children.  When my job became too demanding of my time, he stepped up to help out.  We have had our problems and still are working to straighten some things out.|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	You are not alone. <br>  I think it's just easier to keep asking than it is to get mad and go silent. Especially since the not getting done part is more frustrating than the asking. I don't care if you are a stay at home wife/mom or not. Everyone should do their part in keeping the house, not just you...|`|3a0d6717f085518722c0b3739942ccc2aa	Ahhhh... the ultimate question.  Welcome to the club.  My husband was brought up in a typical Greek home.  The mother does everything for them, not only the boys but the girls as well.  This can carry on up till the time they get married and move out... if they move out.  Once they are married, the mother will continue to cook, clean, iron and raise their grandchildren.<br>  <br>  Which leads me to the men.  My husband took a 180 turn when we married and carried half the load with me.  Saturdays we got up and cleaned the house together.  Forget ironing or loading the washer.  That's an impossible thing for him to even think about.<br>  <br>  I stopped working for quite a few years and didn't think it fair that he come home tired after a long day and have to help with chores so I took on all the apt myself.  That includes painting, fixing electrical appliances, etc, which I admit I love doing.<br>  <br>  Even though my mom kept saying that I was spoiling him, I ignored her only to find out that she was right.  Now I work, leaving the house at 7:30am and returning 12 hours later.  My free time is used catching up on cleaning, washing and ironing... and guess what?  I get to do it all by myself.<br>  <br>  He now refuses to help out with the exception of helping out with the cooking, once in a while.<br>  <br>  We argued a few times about it but he made himself very clear on the matter.  He does not want to spend his free time cleaning.<br>  <br>  It's as simple as that.  Other than this flaw he is the man of my life and adores me.  So, stupid or not, I finally accepted it as a fact.  I see it that we have 2 options.  One is fighting all the time about this matter and the other is accepting it, for better or worse.  I accepted it.<br>  <br>  He's not demanding and is always telling me to take it easy.  I suppose if he expected everything of me I might then very well have left him.
85yI99bGaa	I think you should go where you think you would be happier.  If you think you would just be miserable without your family, then it'd probably be better to go to Michigan.  If you'd like to not have freaking miserable winters, you might want to go to California.<br>  <br>  Also, your family isn't "sacrificing" anything.  It's your life and you need to lead it.  And if how you choose to lead it conflicts with what your family wants, well tough cookies for them.  They need to learn to let you be your own person.<br>  <br>  Also, graduate school keeps you pretty busy so the only real time you'd have to spend with your family is during holidays anyways so you wouldn't be seeing them that much even if you did go to Michigan.  Maybe you'd only see them once a year vs 3 or 4 times a year, so I don't think that should be a major factor in your decision making.<br>  <br>  Anyhoo, good luck with everything!|`|x2l1sK5waa	Institution ranking isn't extremely or sooo important. the thing is, it should make u feel comfortable,easy and as long as you're working hard with ur studies, everything will be fine.<br>  <br>  and it's the environment of our institution that is more important than the rank.whether it will make us feel happy, etc<br>  <br>  gud luck~ =)|`|ZqfupVuxaa	you have to go to the one you feel most passionate about !!!<br>  and that will be easier for you to adjust .<br>  but also keep in mind that California Institute of Technology is a great school and that if you can get in you should take the opportunity of going there and keep in mind it will look good on a job application too ...<br>  but go wherever you feel more "safe "|`|AA10104291	Even though CIT is "better", they are both great schools.

aiogS1Pwaa	Personally I wouldn't want to see the death penalty brought back to the UK.<br>  In cases of wrongful conviction an innocent person would end up being killed for a crime they haven't committed. You can't give someone their life back once its been taken from them.<br>  I feel that the death penalty is somewhat like "playing God". Nobody has the right to take someones life.|`|LijKVPUYaa	If I, or someone I love were the victim I would rather they die, frankly.<br>  <br>  For a start "life" in the UK is not actually a full life sentence.  And from what I hear and see on TV about the prisons here it looks like a holiday camp with pool tables and SKY TV... call that punishment?  I think not<br>  <br>  So in short, I 100% agree capital punishment should be brought back|`|U8JZra5Zaa	I'm not sure, i would - for the simple reason being jusrice.<br>  <br>  On the other hand - i would not because they die then that is that wheres the punishment and morale? they wud be feeling guilty anyway so its an easy way out of it. <br>  <br>  I think they should be locked away in a cold dark room NAKED with no warmth and no food and just literally left to rot - yes that is dying but it will be very slow and long and painful. that i would say is justice.<br>  <br>  BUT what if they got the wrong person. I dont know! Its a tricky question but i found it interesting! time for a gold star ;) x|`|i4bjQbPcaa	No, I don't believe in an eye for an eye.  If you lock an innocent person up its easy enough to rectify.  You use the death penalty on an innocent person then there is no way of sorting that out or taking it back.<br>  <br>  Killing someone for murdering someone else shows we are no better than they are|`|Ek0eDO00aa	There's a few murderers out there that have shown no remorse whatsoever and launch an appeal the minute they are sentenced. String em up I say!|`|Y5jiOlAUaa	I can accept and understand most sides of the argument, however, i believe that the death penalty is an unspeakably uncivilized course of action, and we are supposed to be a civilized society in the West. Finally, i wish you would all try and put yourselves in the shoes of others, how would you like it if your life had been abjectly miserable and you were at a significant disadvantage in life-there is no choice, these sort of questions require solemnity and sensitivity in considering.  Too privileged and unsympathetic, not just to other people's suffering but to the human condition.|`|cf2c7a928eb151f3dc7e67af8dc5ee43aa	Yes, for parking offences.|`|96ndKQncaa	yeah for pedophiles, murderers, cannibals and serial killers<br>  I think the participants in gun crime/knife crime should get 90 years to life.|`|61f6e6f435d7885eb7d1dfffa67bff6daa	No I would lock them up for life & i mean life.|`|gTWgbpNFaa	i would love to be the hangman|`|2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	I think that people in the UK have the advantage of being able to look at a death penalty system in action, in the  US.<br>  <br>  First of all, homicide rates are higher in the US than in the UK and, within the US, homicides rates are higher in states with the death penalty than in those without it.  It hasn't made us any safer.<br>  <br>  In the US, innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people.   And, in the UK, there are documented cases where innocent people were executed.<br>  <br>  These two things should be enough to make people question the death penalty.  <br>  <br>  In the US, however, we do have life in prison without the possibility of parole.  It means exactly what it says and it actually costs much less than the death penalty.  The high costs of the death penalty are for the legal process, and the largest part of these costs are at the pre trial stage and at the trial level.

Dk8ro0a1aa	You need to say something and soon. It doesn't have to be an all out approach, but you do need to let him know you are interested in seeing each other to see how it goes. His reaction to your indecisiveness shows that he is someone that may be worth going for. I don't think he has stopped liking you, I think he is just backing off so as not to come off as a pest.

ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	These are all very good questions, so I will try to answer them the best that I can...<br>  <br>  1.  Ask yourself what you truly want out of life.  What are your dreams?  Do you want to have a career?  Do you want to travel to other countries?  Do you want to have kids, and, if so... do you understand that having a child is basically putting your entire life on HOLD for 18 years?<br>  <br>  2.  Life has been bittersweet.  It is hard, but we try to hold on to each other.<br>  <br>  3.  Financially, we have struggled.  Neither of us finished college, and we had a baby before our first anniversary.  Those medical bills - and the massive life change of becoming parents - literally shattered all of our dreams and plans that we had made together.<br>  <br>  4.  In financial crisis, we have struggled, sold our belongings, moved far away from home, lived in a torn-up-run-down house, gone without little luxuries (like conditioner, internet, or date nights), and we have made many sacrifices in order to get ahead.  When a good job finally came along, we were sooo grateful.<br>  <br>  5.  Regret is sort of a yes-and-no for me.  We struggled, but we are so much happier, closer, and more thankful for it...  I do regret having a baby so early.  I regret not finishing college.  I regret not DOING all the things that we said we'd do together (taking a motorcycle road trip, taking a dance class together, going to Italy, etc).<br>  <br>  I hoped I helped a little.|`|bSiNAsHJaa	you are way too young.  just stay together for a while and see if your ready and still in love by the time your like 25. you dont have to be married to be together cuz marriage is so definate. you are just now old enough to have fun and enjoy life. if you dont then you will regret it and blame him later. trust me doing it to young will end up in heartache right around 7 years.. i been with mine for 12 years and i still refuse to get married cuz i just dont believe it will last forever. and i really dont want to go through all the stress of trying to divorce.|`|lY2XI8kUaa	i got married at 18 my husband was 29. it is hard at times but most marriages are. life finacially is pretty good, we own our own home, so we are only paying bills and car payments.

Sure - you can MF me all you want but 99% of the time that's how it goes down when you get married in your teens.<br>  <br>  I have been with my husband since I was 14 and would have done anything to marry him when I was 15 - 16 - 17 - 18...and so on...but waited. Waited until I was 21 and done with school and working full-time and able to support myself and us if it came down to it. I even bought my first house before we got married - all me! We'll be married 13 years this summer solstice...still going strong!<br>  <br>  If you both really love each other - it will last - without having to married right away. In the interim - finish school and stay on birth control!|`|Po1QAWTnaa	i got married at 19 he was 21. the only way we made it including a baby too, he grew up and took responsibilty and joined the army! i lost him in 2006~!

Deft enjoy yourself and you both finish college and then get married. some many people change during college and theyre relationship doesnt last, not saying yours will but you never know!|`|cdQryr7paa	By the time I was 21 I was married and had 2 kids to take care of.<br>  We couldn't afford much.<br>  We drove junk cars and had to work full time and part time jobs to pay the bills and take care of the kids.<br>  All we could afford was crappy apartments and a trailer house.<br>  We got some help from family, but not much.<br>  It's no fun struggling for money to buy food, diapers, gas and keeping the lights on.<br>  We were broke, ALL the time.<br>  All you can do is just keep on going forward.<br>  It's not easy.<br>  You will find it is much easier being responsible for taking care of just yourself until you are ready, both financially and maturely to combine responsibilties with someone else.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	Who you are when you are 18 and who you are when you are 21 are to completely different people.<br>  <br>  I'm 23 and getting married. I think I'm a bit young for it.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	My advice is to finish school first and get a job before living together and getting married. This way you have experienced what it is like to be on your own before you become a partner ship.|`|fnBPI4OAaa	It doesn't work. Why can't you just wait. Why is the solution to all young people "marriage". Wait till you can AFFORD a life together.|`|LJ2OqF1saa	Don't get married until you have passed the age of 24.  This give you time to get out of college and establish a career, and experience some of what life has to offer.  both of you will be different by this time, and both of you will have grown.  You will know who you are as a person, and you will also know what it is that you want out of life.  So many marriages end in divorce when you marry young.  You  have unrealistic expectations of one another.  If you wait until you are 25,26,27, this will give you the opportunity, to go travel places in the world that you may never have the opportunity to go if you were married, these travels help to define who you are, and make you independent to where you do not have to rely on a man, not that there is anything wrong with that, because we all need someone....but it is so important to grow as a individual, and having that freedom to do so.<br>  <br>  Please wait, and enjoy life and live b4 getting married.|`|rawz0RJuaa	i got married before i finished college and my guy had been out for a few years (he is 5 years older than me)<br>  and let me tell you- we struggled DAILY with money! <br>  you really cant know how much the cost of living- especially if you are totally on your own and married- until it happens.<br>  you are asking for advice from people who have experienced it so listen to this- wait!<br>  wait until you graduate and find a steady job.<br>  money problems are the number one cause of divorce<br>  and at this age, you are even more likely to end up that way. i mean you cant even buy a house or sign a lease for renting an apartment unless you can prove you make a certain amount of money at a steady job- otherwise you have to have someone co-sign! (like a parent) and that is unlikely when you are two 18 year olds in school wanting to get married.<br>  if you really love each other, you will still be together after you both graduate.<br>  we are still happily married, but not without our problems, number one being money. <br>  and he is in the Marine Corps so we get a lot of benefits, yet it is STILL a big problem and very stressful.<br>  what you are talking about is like committing relationship suicide
E8aYI0lKaa	If you guys can't communicate, it will more than likely not work out, I'm sorry.<br>  <br>  Being able to talk to your significant other about anything and everything in a good conversation (more than "yeah" or "im sorry") is a HUGE part of a relationship.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I'd let him go. I wouldn't be able to stand feeling like I'm talking to myself.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|jMGyLvNsaa	you deserve way better!

You deserve better|`|LS8LcuRaaa	Saying "I love you" is a big thing for guys and you can't expect him to say it after just 4 months. It can take a year or two for some guys to say "I love you". Often if men aren't able to hold hands in public, or kiss, etc... they didn't see this at home. Ask him about his family. If he grew up in an environment where there wasn't much love he may not know how to show his affection for you.|`|TrEYixLXaa	Move on, girl.  You can do so much better.|`|tJ6N1IyZaa	Its only been a couple of months give it some time...Maybe a year or two|`|ze4Gt1araa	I'll say move on.<br>  <br>  Move on and find someone that will love you and will care about you and won't ignore you because obviously this is what this guy is doing ignoring you and letting you be the guy and the girl in the relationship he doesn't take his part in nothing just in bed.<br>  <br>  Appearently, he just wants you for sex and as much as you may care for  him or love him DUMP him he's not worth it and if he hasn't love you in 4 months he's not gonna love you at all.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps! :)|`|d61eBHs2aa	For starters, almost every man is "affectionate" in bed. You can trace this back to cave man days. If he is not giving you the affection you are looking for by this point in your relationship, it's not going to happen. If you feel like you need more affection, then you have to leave him and find someone else, because you are not going to get it from him.|`|4kLBziHdaa	move on hunny its only 4 months ugh ive been dealin with my situation for 3 years and i feel stuck take my advice hunny get out right no|`|fLU63N4kaa	You sound like a good person.

He just wants a **** buddy. You deserve better email me P_spire@yahoo.com|`|1F6KJt0oaa	I am glad my wife hasn't come in here asking advice.  Here is the thing.  He isn't comfortable with PDA Perhaps he just isn't comfortable maybe quiet a little bit introverted which doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't get loud and rowdy with his friends.  When you back him into a corner he has two options lash out or retreat into short responses.  He cares about you so he doesn't want to lash out.  When you confronted him last night he was afraid you were trying to leave him.  Probably you are the stronger personality and sometimes can be a bit too direct.  He is having to adjust and work around that but he doesn't know how.  It isn't cool that he can't open up.  I am working on that myself and it isn't easy especially when you don't feel like anything going on with you is worth mentioning.  As to I love you he isn't sure.  It isn't that he doesn't love you but he doesn't know what to do with it or if he really can if that makes sense.  I never had a relationship that worked out very well.  When I felt like I was in love I always had my heart broken.  It took a while for me to feel ok about being in love with my wife.  We still have a lot of fights about me not opening up and with her being high strung and me having a hard time getting overly worked up about anything we have different ideas about what is a big deal.  <br>  <br>  If the only problems y'all have is that he won't say I love you and he clams up when you confront him about either not being at the same place or not acting like he is at the same place then I would say chill out a little.  Give it some time.  Get a feel for what is going on.  Chances are he loves you but he feels like you are putting a lot of pressure on him to respond or feel the way you do.  He probably does but he takes a little longer to express himself or more to the point to get comfortable with it enough to let himself express it.  We deal with things differently and we take a little longer to process deeper emotions and even when we process them we aren't always great at expressing them properly.<br>  <br>  Either that or he is having an affair.|`|95Ep5l38aa	I'd wait a little longer. Saying 'I love you' is hard for a guy and so is being open about how they feel. I'd give it a couple more months. =)|`|omzrFh1Iaa	Don't bring it up anymore. He might come around. Some guys just need time to feel out what they are feeling. If you push it, you will push him away. Don't worry about it! Just enjoy the now. It took me a bit longer than a year to get that "I'm his" reaction if you know what I mean. Just let it happen. Don't try too hard. It will be if it's meant to be.|`|XI7yXINjaa	its very interesting because im going through the same thing right now and all i can say is just do wat ur heart feels..thats what ive been doing. my heart is telling me to stay...but i want to leave because i dont think that he's gonna change. so my advice to you is to just do what you think is best for YOU.|`|6pfW0v3eaa	You deserve so much better. Why be with someone who doesn't respect or appreciate you? Move on. It is easier said than done but you deserve to be with someone who appreciate 100% of the time not just when we wants something.|`|Sr1kywKFaa	Clearly you know the answer, but are too attached to think clearly. If he doesn't want to go out in public with you, that is a huge red flag that he is not that interested in you, because he doesn't want anyone to see you two together. If he isn't taking any interest when you are being emotionally open and talking about something truly deep, then he really isn't interested. Guys may not be "good at" feelings and such, but if he cares, then he'd at least listen. The fleeting good feeling he gives you when you are at home is just not enough to sustain a relationship. If you aren't getting what you want from a relationship, then you need to leave.  I'm suspecting he doesn't care that he's in a relationship at all, otherwise he would be more active in it. So do yourself a favor and leave, and find someone worth your time.|`|d2pohmjEaa	For some reason this sounds oh so familiar with me and the guy im talkin to and my friend and the guy she's having problems with.  TO BEGIN, U should look up the song Never Ever by Ciara....if that boy dont love u by now...he will never ever love you.  For the most part, guys tend to be more emotional or affectionate in bed or behind closed doors. That makes u think, Are they comfortable with this relationship period? If they cant even show affection in public.?  Maybe you should pretend there's someone else rather than him....this would create jealousy within him and he might show how much he "loves" you....(you can only try that if u want...I do not want to ruin anything). Overall girls will be more comfortable displaying affection than guys, so thats something u have to keep in mind.
1f93fe056a8941a67a5c0373d1ae4e0baa	Yes but it might mean something totally different then you think. Dreams have their own way of telling you things and letting you vent.|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	The meaning is mainly up to you. It helps to write down your dream and share it with other as sometimes one can be too blind about self awareness. Some people neglect their true feelings and thoughts, and when they come up in dreams, they do not understand their meaning because they do not feel a conscious connection to the dream.<br>  <br>  Dreams tend to reflect what we are dealing with in real life. For the most part is a way for us to manage uncertainties, possibilities, etc. Like a coping mechanism. So usually the meanings will have connections to what is going on with you in your life. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|MC5ppLIsaa	Dreams always have meaning..... dreaming about your ex means that you have a great relationship coming soon or that you miss something about them but don't exactly want them back. There are books about what dreams mean. Hope this helps :)|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	majority of all dreams have a meaning behind it|`|ZGertwvdaa	I can only wish some of mine did. lol

UZWCn63Vaa	Tis your hormones. You're growing up, getting pissed off with your parents until you've had enough and walk out. Then you'll make your own course in life and learn to live without them.<br>  <br>  It's all part of growing up! XD|`|kafQ6AJBaa	You kno, I wasn't going to respond to this one, but decided against it.Right now it's probably because you need more space away from them.If your parents haven't done anything to you, then it's probably just annoyance.But let me tell you this.At the end of the day, when all is said and done, your parents are the only one's who will be there for you 100% no questions asked.Tomorrow is never promised, and God forbid somethhing bad were to happen to them, and your last thoughts of them was about hate.So just try to distance yourself a little bit.Maybe join a school team or club.Do other activities, so that you aren't spending all of your time being near them,But never say hate, it's such a strong word.|`|qNJVn6N4aa	Its all a phase.  During you teen years, you tend to really want to break free from your parents and just grow up.  Try to keep a positive attitude and  whenever you feel like they are bugging you just take a deep breath and remember that as much as you want to scream and yell they are still your parents.  Keep quiet and let them ramble on because eventually they'll get tired.  Parents will always be annoying but we gottta love them anyhow!!|`|m8iMAPueaa	It's all apart of growing up into a braty teenager. Onces you reach puberty and if your a girl.

Because you never know how great they are, until there gone. So respect them always|`|3a4c2d0397cc1dfb34193eac79a81bf5aa	Your at the age where whatever they say or do is annoying to you .It is natural your a typical teenager that is what they do be rebellious.It would pass though it doesn't last forever but try your best to not be that way.|`|zBioLZ9Saa	probably something that they are doing to you<br>  punish you never letting you go anywhere.<br>  and cause your a teen. all teens think they hate their parents. but you'll get over it when you get a little older|`|PHaOjcuhaa	because your prefrontal cortex is going through some major changes!

You might experience mood swings - I know I did! - which make you short tempered or sad, and likely to blow little things out of proportion. Its normal so its nothing to worry about. If something particular they do makes you angry eg. not giving you enough freedom, then take a few deep breaths and realise that they do what they do because they love you and want you to be safe. Yelling at them will not help you get your own way. Instead, sit down with them and calmly explain your point of view and let them know that you respect their opinion, but that you disagree. Its the best way to get what you want - kicking and screaming is not!<br>   Make sure you are getting enough sleep, as we all know that lack of sleep makes us moody. Also, make sure you are eating a healthy diet, as the types of foods we drink affect our moods in different ways.<br>    So relax, you will grow out of this stage - just try not to be too hard on them!|`|UHTcpdkVaa	Everyone at your age hates their parents.  It's usually because you think they are over protective jerks, and they think you are still a stupid unappreciative baby.<br>  <br>  Both of you are right for what it's worth.<br>  <br>  Only after you accept responsibility for your actions will they begin to treat you like an adult, and only after they treat you like an adult will you start liking them again.

But when I do use it, I feel my husband ALOT better.|`|T272vObnaa	You might try a nice large dildo/vibrator.  I know it's not the same, but we have to take what we can get sometimes, and compromise, especially for love.|`|pRZ0YviYaa	Your options<br>  <br>  -viagra<br>  -lots of oral or digital stimulation <br>  -a penis cover, which goes over your husband's penis and severs to lengthen it by a couple inches, they are real and can be purchased online (a good sex therapist will know this)|`|lY2XI8kUaa	have you tried some tighten up shrink cream. it will make you feel like a virgin again. here is the website, and it costs 9.95 <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.christiestoybox.com/tighten-up-shrink-creme-p-427.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiestoybox.com/tighten-u...</a>|`|9t1taTCtaa	Well my ex was small, I never dared to tell him cause I did not want to hurt him. I have heard of a pill called extenze, try that...|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Have you ever thought about abstaining for 2 weeks?  I have been where you are and it is tough, but you may be having sex to make up for something you lack in your relationship that truly matters.  You see, a man can achieve a hard on, but when he feels that there is something missing, his manhood won't perform up to par.  That is because men have emotional needs too.  And from experience, I can tell you, a man can feel used too.  He may not be responding to you sexually because there is something vital missing for him.  Also, you can do Kegel exercises to tighten the vaginal muscles.  That will help immensely.  As far as abstaining, that will help you both to step back and tease each other, thereby, building anticipation that will assist him to a full erection that is tremendous.  He can also see a urologist who can help him.  There are also, medications on the market that alleviate male size and functional problems.  But honestly, what are you doing that you have gotten too big to accomodate him?  Have you ever thought about that?  Kegels girl, Kegels.  Good Luck|`|AXbdNdPzaa	I have been there.  The only thing that worked for me was a vibrator while we were being intimate.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Instead of throwing him out in the cold because of his lack of equipment size, take him to the sex shop and let him purchase the largest strap on that you can find, then when he has competed his needs you can have him put the strap on and give you the thrill you have been waiting on.  You could also suggest one of the machines that does all the work, while you service him with your mouth.  If all else fails you can always invite another man into the bedroom and both of them could please you until you could not walk.  Have fun.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Well, personally size does not matter to me because I cannot have an orgasm with intercourse.  Oral only for me!<br>  <br>  Maybe he should just please you orally?<br>  Would that work for you?|`|sGP6s7uraa	Have YOU tried doing Kegal exercises?  It could help with tightening you up so he feels larger.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Ok,<br>  <br>  1. Try abstaining a bit. You may be literally be wearing the thing out. Switch to cuddling for a few weeks. <br>  <br>  2. Check his blood pressure. This can cause ED...but it can also cause smaller erections in more minor cases. <br>  <br>  3. Is he a vegetarian? I've had a few male friends who gave up red meat and had similar issues. Get him a steak every few days.<br>  <br>  4. Does he exercise? Proper circulation is required to become fully erect. <br>  <br>  5. Stress, exhaustion, smoking, caffeine, drugs? <br>  <br>  If he's got them, he needs to lose them. Especially the drugs. Pot smokers have performance trouble.<br>  <br>  You might, on your end, start doing Kegal excercises.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	HOney don't stress. Go to your local adult novelty store. They make toys that fit onto your mans Pen*s that will make it appear to be large and in charge. you can get them with attachments on the end for your pleasure as well. The fact that he is so open to fix the problem is great, i am sure he ouwld be willing to ear this contracption to benefit your needs. Try a co*k ring to those help keep him nice and big for you.
9AobEMysaa	You might not be over our ex because you have been with him for so long and it takes a lot to try and move on and try to lock away special memories in which you had with him both romantically, and unromantic (being that u guys were friend b4 hand) To be honest I don't think you will ever get over him your just gonna have to learn how to work around your emotions and try to move on to even get close to getting over him. Its normal for you to feel that way but you should start to see the good in other guys and try not to compare ppl to your ex. Bing that you do compare ppl to ur ex i can only imagine that you still think of him and wonder how he is or what he's doing....You leave the past in the past and if it's meant to be the past will come back to you. As for now just have fun and try 2 put it all behind you....<br>  <br>  <br>  If not then try to find his number or find out where he is at and give him a call...remember where there once was fire the ashes will still remain.|`|FUcYuZ8saa	It may have been a year, but to your heart it's hasn't been very long at all.  You haven't moved on.  And you have forgotten the reasons why you left him.  You will be over him only when you decide to be.  You have cheated yourself out of meeting a lot of great guys this past year because you are still stuck in the past.  How much more time are you planning to waste?<br>  <br>  Get out there.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|HjXTkHK5aa	Of coarse the reason you still aren't over him is because you still have feelings for him.If you really cant get over him then try to see if you can work things out and get back with him ... but if you cant its your decision to stop dating forever and be lonely or find another companion.If i were you id forget about him.Don't let this brake up get in the middle of your happiness.<br>  I hope this helps.|`|q9n6qaUxaa	Sorry if the following is a little personal! Well if you ever had sex with you set of chemicals in your body that connect you to your partner. And maybe that's the reason why you haven't got over him yet?!|`|fLU63N4kaa	Does he love you?<br>  <br>  If not then stop living in the past. Move on. Don't waste your time on anyone who isn't willing to waste their time on you.<br>  <br>  But if he loves you, then go for it.|`|axCFlk5Zaa	The only way to get over an ex is to find someone else.|`|jAQVFrvOaa	Maybe you feel a little guilty about something. U may not have been ready to break that relationship off, so now your beating yourself up with the wat ifs. I think you should concentrate on you right now, and getting yourself together. It doesnt sound like your ready to jump in another relationship. You might need some closer. Think about some things you can do to keep your mind off of him. Go hang out wit some friends have a little fun, minus your free time..when you have to much time on your hands your mind starts to wonder. Good luck|`|snzMW46daa	memories never fade when it comes to situations like these. they can be as vivid as yesterday (seems to be especially so, in your case). i've been in your exact situation. every time you're reminded of your ex, it brings back all the good memories you have of him, and with the memories come the feelings. time and space for me was the only thing that stopped all that. if it's you who left him, maybe you should really think about why you did in the first place. if it seems like a mistake to you, try reconnecting with him if he's up to it. see what happens. good luck hun, hope this helps!!!|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	You need a rebound guy, that will clear your head.

zzAprLEQaa	he's trying to play games. he wants you but at the same time he doesn't know what he should do. your both probably about the same age and if i think about it people often have a relationship like yours at least once in there life. but don't get confused he says he likes you and also that he doesn't wanna get back with you, guys are weird and they usually listen to there friends if one friend says play hard to get and another says try to get back with her he will follow both and confuse not only you but himself.<br>  Ask yourself tho do you love him still?<br>  <br>  sometimes the best relationship comes with a challenge|`|39abb5b2896cf0dc5417324d95a3a1deaa	That kind of behavior should make you want to run the other way.  Trust me on that one.  I wouldn't put another ounce of energy into trying to figure him out.  Just respond back with, " well good I'm glad you don't want me back, cause I don't want you back either.|`|axCFlk5Zaa	Move on. <br>  <br>  Long distance relationships don't work.

Tell her you want to clarify something and mention the comment to friend made. Say " When she said that it made me feel like maybe you were trying to tell me through her ( the friend) not to crowd you and I just wanted to check with you on that rather than to assume anything. I want to know how YOU feel about it"     How can she not admire you then for 1. wanting to know and respect how she feels 2. Double checking the truth with her. Message: You are a caring communicator and are willing to let her have her space, but are DEFINITELY still interested in her.
xZG0q6vXaa	it's just one of those things you will have to answer for at the Pearly Gates of Heaven.<br>  <br>  Why did mom give you an eye?  She answered that - so you could see the whole picture & not get teased in school.<br>  Why did she leave you a note?  She had motherly instincts that you'd come; & she knew her time was almost up & it was time you knew what was what.<br>    Now what are you going to do?  Sign a donor card?  Apologize?

fZfVM1unaa	One thing long distance relationships have going for them is verbal communication.  Unfortunately, they become more theoretical than practical.  It's like the process of writing up blue prints.  You can't anticipate all the problems, and possible victories, that will pop up during the building process.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No! Because you can't see the other person all of the time and it's best to find somebody that you can be with for real life!|`|eqLFfXfyaa	My best friend and her bf started dating in high school and made it all the way through college still together and are currently living in the same town. It's a lot of work. Think of how much work a serious relationship is, imagine not being able to kiss and make up. It's that much harder.|`|F89MNQheaa	Depends on the person. My mum and dad was long distance. Mum lived in scotland and came to work in a village hotel in cumbria and thats where she met my dad who was a local, they fell in love and when mum had to go back home as the "season" ended they stayed in touch, he rang her every night from the local phone booth. Then he proposed after about 2 years, she got ready in scotland he came up and married her, they had their honeymoon in edinburgh, then dad went back down to cumbria until they could find a house, which took about 2/3 months and they have been together 26 years. Yes it can work, you both have to work at it though.|`|pJ7icz0taa	Long Distance relationships rarely work..maybe 2 out of 100.<br>  I was in one for 6 years I was 22 he was 20  it was great for the first 3 years and then we grew apart..he wanted marriage..I didn't.. he needed to grow up.  we are both in our late 20s and he still hasn't grown up and i caught him in a lot of lies.   Living a long distance is toooo hard. We are not even friends anymore and that is still painful.<br>  I put thumbs down on it.|`|GhsqaXsdaa	Yes. But it's very hard :(|`|R5Dl17Draa	They can be tough, but if both people really care about each other enough and are willing to make it work, then they can work out.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	Yes, they are very possible. I have been involved in two successful LDR's. The key is being good on the phone and some kind o fan end date on the horizon.<br>  I am married now for ten years.

We dated long distance for eight months, got engaged while I was visiting on a weekend and finally got her moved up to my new city three months before our marriage. <br>  Don't let time, distance, age, income, school or any other thing keep you from the one you love!|`|3USNsjlTaa	Nah|`|9t1taTCtaa	If you are both willing to do it if you are both on the smae page than yes it is possible.

I have been with someone for two years who lives across the country, and it works for key reasons. For one, we are both very busy, we are both trying to form futures for ourselves, and neither of us are very clingy or needy. We are both patient, and we are not superficial. Neither of us really needs that constant attention, we are both intellectually stimulated, so it is fulfilling just to be able to communicate and share ideas. We don't need constant human contact, but eventually we both know that we will come together in person, so it makes it even more incredible when we do. <br>    Its like.. waiting makes it more worthwhile.|`|wa18Uyeuaa	No, I don't.<br>  They just wouldn't work for me.<br>  I need my boyfriend there with me.|`|6r6s5AfXaa	No|`|hLmtDkU5aa	it is but beware a lot of things get lost in translation|`|bNuuxJv1aa	Yes I think that they are possible because me and my boyfriend only used to see each other about once a month cause he lived in a completly different county then I did and we also never had the time too see each other.|`|P3LwYllFaa	nope<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&cp=6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  <br>  please answer!|`|JRizSTYdaa	yea they can work me and bf lived 5 hours apart train journey we now been together almost 3 years and living toogether and expecting our first baby in sepptember it can be hard but if you really like each other you make it work|`|TyXTeMlraa	i did it for 7 months there he lives in glasgow and am 60miles away, and hes a police man and it stressed him out so didnt work for me|`|Q6uA8t9baa	If you are both equaly committed then yes it can work.|`|bnNcPAknaa	They could work as long as you BOTH put effort into it.

I'm in one right now, I have been for almost 11 months. April 6th will be our one year together.<br>  <br>  If you honestly love the other person, your love will give you the ability to span the miles, and it'll be that much greater when you finally get to see that someone.<br>  <br>  But there are also many hardships along with it, you may worry if they're cheating. That's the point where you just have to trust them.

Very Possible!|`|Q2idNMmLaa	Well they can be really tough, but if you have strong feelings for the person, than it will more than likely work out in the long run,<br>  and besides, some things are worth waiting for(:|`|jzoaRsV8aa	hell yes do the best you can i mean it work hard|`|d5ioXi5Aaa	possibly,  it could work out for you both,  depending on how much you are committed to each other.
9RAFabFEaa	I totally agree with others about you being wayyy too young to be even thinking about stuff like that. Its ok to have a boyfriend but y are u rushing to grow up so fast. When you get older you will understand and wish you were younger. Take it slow and make the right decision. There are too many young parents out there and you do not want to be one of them.|`|NgUbzaF9aa	You're 14 and giving oral sex? Yes, please grow up first. 14 year old boys are also turned on by blowing up there toys and picking on small animals too. Please don't think they are so serious about relationships, like you obviously think you are.|`|hnhb119Laa	Guys are very VERY visual.  Go down that path. And braces don't get in the way at all when you are giving oral.|`|DErBSfZgaa	Suck and lick his neck.<br>  GUYS LOVE IT. and nibble on his ear too. i never thought it would<br>  really work but guys seriously love it :)|`|RPa1LhNqaa	try a sexy lap dance or wear something very reveling|`|QJslTCUBaa	Please grow up first. :-(|`|3a4c2d0397cc1dfb34193eac79a81bf5aa	Wait don't rush into things grow up first.
Efq8J20eaa	Hi, you should speak to her about how you feel tell her shes a good friend if you dont wanna be more then friends. she may like the attension, and she might have the wrong idea about you calling her babes back. good luck x|`|ze4Gt1araa	Lol wow she's totally into you! <br>  <br>  Yeah she is making you slowly her boyfriend or that's just part of her flirting. My advice will be you should ask her what she wants and if she wants you than ask her out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)|`|HOVvKqxsaa	she want you to ask her out!|`|KcK8W40faa	she can't make you do anything that you don't want to do<br>  talk to her and ask her what she wants<br>  and decide what you want <br>  its not anything until you say it is|`|bNuuxJv1aa	She is trying to get you to ask her out. So if you like her then ask her out.
Q2idNMmLaa	Well i think the first step is for her to try and get out of "shyness" like getting out more and meeting new people.<br>  cause its not going to work out very well if she's that shy.<br>  <br>  good luck and i hope everything works out(:|`|KK718Xxaaa	yeah you can guys are everywhere the people on free dating sites are looser she dont want one of them!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  juggalette 4 life<br>  much love to the juggalo family<br>  jamie madrox and violent j and shaggy 2 dope r hot lol<br>  sexiest killa u know<br>  peace. im out.<br>  bloody B
CYwha8Baaa	wow thats a tough one <br>  <br>  I would tell her <br>  <br>  or say hey you know how you said you liked me last year<br>  <br>  when she replys yes<br>  <br>  Tell her well I liked you to then<br>  <br>  then in a seperate text say and I STILL DO like you<br>  <br>  I wish I would of know that before because I would of loved to have you as my girlfriend....<br>  <br>  then if she replys REALLY?<br>  or says wow me to<br>  <br>  then your set<br>  <br>  but if she replys with something like well I have a boyfriend now and sorry i should of told you then I would move on<br>  <br>  BUT <br>  <br>  I will give you advice that ALL GIRLS KNOW<br>  girls dont tell you information like<br>  <br>  " OH I LIKED YOU ALL LAST YEAR " for no reason<br>  <br>  she did because she wants you to make a move<br>  <br>  really and honestly <br>  <br>  GO FOR IT
IeeaLYubaa	suprise him by driving to see him!!! he will be amazed and feel very special and cared for|`|83TkWic3aa	See him! Don't waste money on material crap, go see your man!|`|qGOxMYpHaa	send him a ham|`|BJuyUnfDaa	send him an e-card<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ecards.myfuncards.com/myfuncards/splash.jhtml?tp=ZUxdm458YYUS" rel="nofollow">http://ecards.myfuncards.com/myfuncards/...</a>
T72COWC8aa	I know it is hard to trust anyone after what happened to you. I think you need to go on with your life regardless.... You cannot treat every person like the enemy because of what happened, it was not they're nor your fault. You will have hurtful experiences but they will be new & you are more mature now to cope with them..<br>  <br>  Live for yourself & not your past ;) <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ze4Gt1araa	I'll say when he approaches you like kissing you and you know that he wants to be sexually with you don't pull away. Keep kissing him and let your feeling lead you on. And I'm soooo sorry to hear that I really hope you can move on and have a happy ending.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|bnNcPAknaa	Tell him that you've been hurt in your past, (you dont have to tell him how unless you want to) & you never want to be put in a position where you could be hurt again. & give it time before you let it down, If you let it down to fast he might take advantage of it. & if you trust him then thats a good sign, depends how long you guys have been goin out cause it might be time ta let it down (; !|`|HOVvKqxsaa	if its this hard for you start texting him about it and he'll start a conversation with you
wKbRwH3haa	Its a strong man who can put his pride aside like that.  It wouldn't stop me dating him.. unless of course he lived with his mother :)|`|YkseyT7zaa	the person is making a living which is more than you can say about a lot of people.<br>  I have a lot of respect for a person that can overcome their pride or ego to do what they need to do to make it work|`|AA10873763	I can't say that I'm a typical female, but I don't really care what a person does for a living or how much they make, or even if they work at all.  What matters is responsibility - live within your means, don't abuse the unemployment/welfare system.<br>  Some people (women, traditionally) are wayyyyy too concerned with material things.<br>  In the above scenario, the guy is working, bringing in income, making a contribution.  Who cares if he doesn't have to get out of his pj's to do it?<br>  I have a job.  I don't need a man to support me or buy me crap.  If I want crap, I'll buy my own.|`|E23PtUEtaa	I say as long as he is being a man and taking care of his family then it doesnt matter whether hes flippin burgers or a ceo..its responsibility and hard work that I respect|`|1o3OqSioaa	McDonald's etc. won't hire 3 piece suiters, because they are over qualified for the job. They know that someone with a white collar background won't stick around for long, and will not be happy with minimum wage. <br>  As far as a 40 yr. old man or woman working for fast food establishments, I respect anyone willing to humiliate themselves by doing so. I had to once, when my husband walked out on me.  I had two young children and did not want to resort to welfare, so I reluctantly put on my paper hat, and "flipped hamburgers." <br>  You don't understand humiliation until you've adorned a paper hat in public, and everyone that you know comes in and see's you in all your glory. That takes guts, and no one should judge other's until you've walked a mile in their shoes, or flipped hamburgers in their paper hat.|`|AA11447210	In the present economy, I wouldn't look on it so harshly as when better jobs were easier to come by. If I lost my job today, I'd be working fast food or retail tomorrow if that's what it took to bring in a paycheck, rather than sit on my butt and complain I couldn't find any jobs "good enough".<br>  <br>  So it would depend on the circumstances. If that's what he desired to do and had no greater ambitions, I wouldn't be attracted to that. If he was doing what he needed to do, to get through hard times, I'd respect it.|`|EpqSDAGyaa	A husband and wife are supposed to support each other! If you really love someone you will know that times aren't always going to be peachy! I say if you get laid off, Go get a job doing SOMETHING, I don't care if its mcdonalds or selling oranges off of the freeway! I mean no woman really wants a lazy man..But as long as hes trying is all that matters!|`|eWMn7dhKaa	My take is that they are a bunch of hypocritical women that need to have their jobs removed from them and put into the laboring workforce of the hospitality system.  Then we'll see what they have to say about that.<br>  <br>  Unless you've actually worked in the industry, you have no right to complain about the industry.|`|dkzsbUy9aa	im not a lady but this is pretty silly, i mean, its not about where the guy works or that because it doesnt matter...<br>  <br>  If he is a nice guy and is lovable then somebody will date him, personality and looks can cause a relationship, not where they work|`|kcSZ03TLaa	it would be ok only if it was the only job he could find.  If he was just a 40yr old slacker living with his mom and working at mcdonalds: LOOOOSERRRRR|`|PVb3iiaAaa	that hes a e'ffin bum!!!!!! get a better job!!!|`|p3szz8g2aa	i think its sad and just...damn sad|`|2Y0WXtyNaa	You do whatever you have to do to put bread on the table. I think if you called him a bum you deserve to lose your job and be faced with the same decision. Let's see how you do.<br>  <br>  ALSO: I have never had to work in fast food but I'm sure it's not "easy" and I'm sure there's nothing "lazy" about it.|`|TeXaZaW3aa	...just cause u work at a fast food place isnt  a bad thing...some ppl go to school for mangement an work at mcdonalds an get really good money...an some go to school for business an have corporate possitions an thats major...so yeah there nothing wrong with it unless ur fry boy...lol.. also the woman should be glad u have job ..but it is kinda said for a middle aged man to work there unless he got a degree for that...or just got out of prison|`|axCFlk5Zaa	What if that was the only job he could find in this economy?<br>  <br>  The economy is fine for those who know what there doing. <br>  <br>  Go to college. Get a job that is in high demand, even in this economy. <br>  <br>  The problem is most people don't have an education to find a job in this economy.|`|JgM0Dwfraa	WELL ITS SIMPLE GEOMETRY<br>  <br>  HUBBA HUBBA YOUR IN TRUBBA|`|d61eBHs2aa	I personally would not be interested in dating a 40 year old man who worked at a fast food restaurant. I have put a lot of work into getting my college degree, and want to be with someone who has done the same. That's not to say that NO woman would want to date that kind of guy, but I want someone with similar goals and accomplishments as myself. If he has a college degree and is working at some "crap job" to make ends meet in between finding a "real" job, that's a different story.
BgRGlU9jaa	damn hate dealing with this<br>  give it time thats what i had <br>  to do. Her mom will eventually<br>  let it go, dont worry.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	No you're crazy for having your friend go behind her Mom's back and she's getting exactly what she deserves!
yLAwXs4vaa	Please for the love of God and the English language, stop typing like an uneducated ghetto rat. <br>  <br>  Secondly, loose this girl's number. She's obviously stated that she doesn't want your attention. Move on. Girls are very feelings oriented. She probably didn't want your attention/text messages in the first place, but rather than being "stop talking to me!" she decided to deal with it. 30 text messages when her phone was off? Dude, you have issues and you might want to see somebody about it. You'll NEVER get a girlfriend like that. Yick, just reading that gives me the shivers. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately it wasn't cool about the lack of directness on her part. It's a shame that it got to the point where she feels she has to call the police to get you to stop. But do yourself a favor and accept it as a flaw of the female race. Loose the chick's number and dodge a mark on your record.|`|ktRoqxXRaa	erw shes abitch for saying that to you, she's not worth it, yeah you may have texted her alot but your right she answers so its not harassment or stalking, unless she was texting you back telling you to stop texting her.<br>  <br>  and tbh i dont think there is such a thing as a number harassment list, she may be saying that to intimidate or threaten you.<br>  <br>  if i was you i just wouldnt text her anymore but its your decision. also if you have proof that she was answering your texts then you shouldn't be in any trouble x|`|CvkuzcpDaa	i dont know if its illegal or not...but she doesnt sound like a very good friend/person to talk to!!! so i wouldnt text her anymore....i dont think you're 'harrasing her' but why bother with her??<br>  if she doesnt want u to text her i wouldnt !!!<br>  good luck,.,.xxxx
E8aYI0lKaa	A wedding ring? Or do you mean an engagement ring?<br>  <br>  Our wedding bands only cost about 200 each. My engagement ring was 600 though.<br>  <br>  However, the price should be what you can afford...the price doesn't compare to the meaning behind it|`|4POGapREaa	Whatever is reasonable to you based on your finances.  If you're struggling and $300 would put you behind on your electric bill, then that's where you're at.  If you're making 10k a month, then 3k is probably reasonable.  It just depends.  My set was around $2,500 which I honestly thought was too much but my boss's ring was $75,000.|`|l43NSgHyaa	Reasonable really depends on your income level and the amount of disposable income you have.   You should buy the very best ring you can afford without going into debt and without depleting or overextending your savings/emergency fund.<br>  <br>  If you sit down and look at your bank account, you should be able to come up with that number relatively quickly.  Ask yourself, "How much money can I withdraw and spend from my savings, without feeling like I'm compromising my future?"<br>  <br>  Usually, you can get a decent engagement ring and wedding band (bridal set) for about $2,500-$3,500.  But, that might be too much money for you.   So, adjust it according to your needs.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	it depends on what you want. plain bands are pretty inexpensive, if you want diamonds in them the price goes up. or you can go with cubic zirconia if you are tight on money but want the diamond look, and those rings are usualy very inexpensive. for guys rings like titanium and tungsten are usually less expensive than gold ones.|`|ODYrypwaaa	So say you should spend about three months of your yearly salary.  However, if you make $24,000 a year it is probably not a good idea to spend $6000 on a ring.  Make sure it is something you can afford but at the same time remember you have to look at these rings every day.  So it's ok to splurge a little.|`|Drw4Gg1Daa	My fiance's wedding band (14k white gold) was $400 and my wedding band (14k white gold with diamonds all around) was also $400.  However, my platinum engagement ring (2+ carat sapphire + smaller diamonds equally 0.90 carats) was $4,000.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	Wedding rings are pretty affordable - its the engagement ring that costs a bundle.<br>  <br>  Simple/basic wedding bands start around $100 to $150.<br>  <br>  If you go for bands with stones in them, the prices go up.|`|AZcxKGDZaa	In 2007 the AVERAGE prices in the USA were<br>  <br>  engagement ring (with diamonds) $3500<br>  wedding ring $700<br>  <br>  since then the averages have come down as people are not feeling that wealthy!<br>  <br>  You can get a simple (skinny) band for as little as $50 in 14 K gold!<br>  But you can splurge too, specially if you include diamonds on your wedding bands. In this case greater than 70% of the ring price will usually be for the diamond(s).<br>  <br>  Another way to go is to select hand-crafted jewelry. You can get a good price and you will have something very special and personal.  I suggest looking at <br>  www.etsy.com <br>  or<br>  <a href="http://www.maidstonejewelry.com/bridal" rel="nofollow">http://www.maidstonejewelry.com/bridal</a><br>  etc.<br>  this may also be of interest to you:<br>  <a href="http://maidstonejewelry.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://maidstonejewelry.wordpress.com</a>|`|SVuYaK8maa	My wedding ring will only be about 100.00.  We are going to look hard for one under that.  I don't like wearing ring's.  Or anything that is jewelry.
grPckwSsaa	yes, <br>  <br>  but if she gave you her number, you shouldnt have waited 2 weeks... girls dont like that|`|lGclixPuaa	YES you should. You'd be lucky if she even picks up the phone. 2 weeks is a long time to wait, buddy. She probably thinks you have no interest in her.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220104108AAysVGx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|ac8dc80e2b62f00106cc277f1c707213aa	Am I the only one that thinks he shouldn't?<br>  <br>  Dude, it's probably a lost cause. Find another girl at a different party. Trust me, there are no shortage of women in this world.|`|ze4Gt1araa	Yes you should call her, but why did you wait so long?<br>  <br>  Most likely, she's thinking you weren't into her. Call her and make it up!<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|Un9CElCaaa	go for it but u shouldnt have waited so long. youll be lucky if she answers the phone. if she doesnt just leave a message. and next time a girl gives u her number dont wait more than 4 days to call her|`|5sCpMpbWaa	Yeah go for it hi!|`|AarbyJRSaa	YES. If you liked her you should have called her a LONG time ago. But everything will be fine, all you have to do is make up some cute reason you weren't able to call her, but make sure you dont make up some ridiculous lie that she wont believe, try something like you were getting up the courage to call her and your really sorry it took so long or you didn't know if she felt the same way and you were scared to call her I know most guys dont like to fess up to being intimidated but after 2 weeks of not calling that's pretty much your only option but please, please dont say something stupid like, I had work, I was out of town, or you lost her number. Good Luck!|`|nJ9lGMmQaa	Yeah, I would call her. Why did you wait so long?? If you plan on doing it at all, do it soon. 2 weeks is a long time.|`|KcK8W40faa	call her right now! and tell her something really cute about why you haven't called..<br>  like you were really nervous or something...|`|EcSbNWMbaa	She probably thinks you don't like her :( call her ASAP!!|`|Efq8J20eaa	yes you should just casual convosation to see if she remembers you good luck x|`|XI7yXINjaa	yes. you should've called her at the maximum 3days later.. i hope she remembers you.|`|WDS2DASnaa	well no offense but i think you sort of blew it by waiting so long. i bet she's forgotten|`|WU7xMQCyaa	Yes please do
Gt8NoO2waa	Yes, pulled down my shorts in gym class, unfortunatly he grabbed my underwear in the process, and I was standing in the middle of the gym butt naked, with the girls class watching from the other end of the gym.<br>  All turned out well though, as some girls felt sorry for me, and thats when I got my first gf and kiss, So all turned out well. By the way that bully is now a homeless druggie.|`|Rj3epU5yaa	i've never been bullied, i was bigger than all the bullies and most of my friends were band geeks.  it seemed to work out good for everyone.  i was also a middle linebacker on the football team.|`|661f39420372e21b090f02f05da73dfaaa	Yes, its happens a lot, the worst thing is letting it continue.|`|NjL6UlRwaa	whatever everyone who says no is full of crap,everyone has at sometime or another.|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	yes in middle school i was he use to trip me in the hallways call me names have others beat me up all because i liked him.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	When I was 9 years old. I was chased home. I told my dad. He told me if I didn't go out there and fight he was going to beat the crap out<br>  of me. So I went outside and knocked the kids front teeth out . The police came over. I had to go before a judge. I had to do 25 hours of community service. 34 years later I still have a nasty scar on my <br>  hand from his teeth. But I was never bullied again.|`|lBKfmRWCaa	Yes I was bullied.<br>  <br>  And no, I did not "let" myself get bullied, I was a young child and was told to always turn the other cheek and walk away. Looking back I wish I had been stronger and fought back but hind sight is a great thing.<br>  <br>  It dented my confidence for years, I thought I was fat and ugly but looking back at my old photos, I was not. It took years to stop thinking of myself like that and be happy with myself.<br>  <br>  There is a special place in hell for bullies.|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	I was bullied when I was a little kid because I was in a new school and this guy kept belittling me and laughing in my face in front of the whole class.<br>  <br>  I opened a can of ##### $$$$ and I was never bother by anyone ever again.

XI7yXINjaa	maybe he did love you, but deep down inside loved his wife more. also it sounds like he wanted his cake...and wanted to eat it too. the advice i have for you is to just leave him alone, because if he really cared about you he wouldn't have disowned you so suddenly just because she needed his help...and if you ask me if there married and have a baby..(that isnt his) then he should've been left that trick..well all i can say if goodluck in your next relationship..n take your time.|`|V6CFNRRvaa	what does love got to do with it?|`|T1SmVFwCaa	wait until everyone is asleep and burn his house down
Rf34tR4Saa	do something personal to her. Like loads of pictures of you and her together in a book or a photo frame|`|x2l1sK5waa	lol. all i can think is..how on earth u don't know her bday? no offense but just wondering. <br>  <br>  anyway, just give her something that u know she really likes it, or nvr expect it (but of course,she'll luv it) etc. it's kinda hard whether you can top off her BF's present bcuz trust me, she loves u both much. so, in this case, there's no winning. she'll appreciate all the presents from u both.
hy8PbMj6aa	oh god no.!<br>  you definately made the right choice. you're not a skank.<br>  and don't ever let a guy make you feel like one.he was stupid for doing that. and plus if you really need the money for school you can find other ways to get it then lowering yourself to taking money for letting a guy feel you up and stuff..<br>  <br>  if it was me i prob. would have let him get the money. and give it to me and yell rape really loud and run away. lmao.=] i'm just funny like that. but yeah you made the right choice. ?|`|y9TUWrjIaa	Good for you hon. You're a young woman with common sense and ethics. How you handle these things will change as you mature with age. ( I should know :) ) You did the right thing. We all need to be able to respect our selves.
0nR2Rsj7aa	I am sure they luv you both the same at times parents go about showing this the wrong way. I have an older brother who was and still is a pain in the **** lol. he was always in trouble and my mum and dad seemed to favour him all the time its only know i see that they didnt. they just needed to spend more time kicking his ***|`|a20KcBqdaa	i cant believe that your parents could love your sister more than you. thats just wrong! but look, even if they do, you know youre good for something, so dont get yourself down about them not liking you as much. dont you go thinking that you are a disappointment. show them the respect they show you. if they have those kind of feelings against you, they are hardly worth your time. keep your head held high and smile :)|`|kcSZ03TLaa	Learn to live with it.|`|sA8fkTlhaa	Don't worry, she shall mess up one day =]|`|7PbJWEo1aa	Welcome to the real world. Parents are cruel and fickle sometimes but don't mean to be nasty with it. You need to try and do something constructive with your own life - don't live up to your sister - live up to your own expectations.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	You don't - because they don't love her more than you.  Love has nothing to do with how much you like someone, it has to do with how much they want the person to succeed and thrive.  I guarantee you, they want to to succeed and thrive as much as your sister.  They want to protect you as much as they want to protect your sister, and they will celebrate your success just as much.<br>  <br>  What you might try is to stop focusing on your sister and focus on your own life.  Instead of comparing yourself with her, compare yourself with the you from yesterday.  Only by consciously improving ourselves can we truly make a difference in our own lives.  But regardless of how much they may like you - they still love you deeply.<br>  <br>  My parents didn't like me for a long time, but neither did I.  Trust me, all things change in time.

It breaks the ice right away, gets you laughing a little, there's some banter, and you also learn a little about that person.  <br>  <br>  Not that these are the best, but these are the a couple things I heard recently that sparked some interesting and humorous conversations:<br>  <br>  "I think Shakepeare must have been gay.  He cast men in womens' roles.  What do you think?"<br>  <br>  "Who would win in a fight?  Abe Lincoln or Barack Obama?"<br>  <br>  But above all, just be yourself. :)  Good luck!
E8aYI0lKaa	Okay...? <br>  <br>  So don't ask him out. <br>  <br>  Guys aren't worth losing friendships over. Consider her feelings.|`|g26li8Neaa	screw her get him! ?|`|lY2XI8kUaa	i think that if your friend likes him to, then you probably shouldn't date him. it may cause a lot of trouble between the two of you.|`|nJ9lGMmQaa	Ask him out before she can. lol. It's a jungle out there.
dkzsbUy9aa	it means he loves you but has personal reason why you either cant be together or that, he means that he is not ready for a relationship<br>  <br>  give him space and talk to him or you will lose him|`|kafQ6AJBaa	That's a tricky one.Sometimes it could just simply mean get your **** together.Guys don't like all of the petty stuff that we women sometimes throw their way.Little stuff to us, may be a big issue to them.So when he says that it just means I love You, but we are having problems, and until you can be mature enough to stop accusing me,then maybe we can pick up where things left off.<br>  <br>  Now, on the other hand, it could mean that he is really doing all of those things that you suspect him of doing, and he doesn't want to get caught.So every little thing you do, he thinks that you are overreacting, when in reality you aren't.Maybe he wants to take time away form the relationship and do his thing, and when he is done playing, he wil come back,It's what guys do|`|71EwzPSlaa	um...it means that you probably have some problems that he feels need to be addressed before the both of you can continue with your realationship...it seems to me that your a little jealous cuz you went and made a fake account to see what he was doing ....and you found something that you didnt want to see....this stuff can be really touchy because it can end a relationship cuz jealousy leads to trust issues and you cant be with someone forever if you dont trust them....|`|ifC1aFHxaa	Please give us the gift of punctuation to make your question more clear.<br>  What this all means is hes not that into you enough to focus on you and not on whatever this Website had. <br>  You shouldn't need to sneak around on Websites to see what your bf is up to. And he shouldn't have turned it all around to try to make you feel guilty for spying.<br>  Good luck with this guy.|`|Qlo4ZWGraa	It means that he cares for you deeply, but that he recognizes that he is unable to solve all of your problems for you.  And that you must address some of those unresolved problems to continue your relationship.<br>  <br>  In other words, love alone is not enough.|`|0pAczRv2aa	it means that<br>  you need to shape up man<br>  and if you love him back you better do it fast before he falls for some1 else and you miss your chance|`|axCFlk5Zaa	Your question is made up of your answer. <br>  <br>  It means get yourself together.|`|cL05NtA3aa	I would break up with him if he does love you y would he even say that how gay!!!!|`|f4keqWZfaa	you both need to be dating other people - it shows in the way you relate to each other..|`|V6CFNRRvaa	it means get your act together|`|fR2Geezcaa	He actually sounds mature and knows he can not fix your problems for you, that you have to work on them for yourself. <br>  <br>  If your setting up fake accounts to snoop on him you have major insecurities issues and he knows he can not fix them for you. It is up to you to work on your self esteem and trust issues, for a healthy relationship.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	It means he is out of Funyuns.|`|fvuEtkROaa	Your run-on sentence suggets SOMETHING is wrong: most people would use punctuation.  Get some counseling.|`|jK5FXm6Naa	Sounds like you both need time, age and experience|`|AA11631715	variant on "its not you its me," the brushoff.|`|sGP6s7uraa	It means exactly what it says....
fR2Geezcaa	Don't walk away, RUN AWAY!!!! He is lying about the website and you know it; how do you post in a site and not know it? <br>  <br>  There are plenty of good guys out there that won't abandon you and your child to do drugs and look for sex on-line. You are alone in the relationship and he is only worried about his own self gratification. You deserve better and if you have a hard time believing it, then do it for your daughter. She needs a better role model or else she is going to end up in the same boat as your in now.|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	You don't have any right to stay with him when he is on drug.  You do have the right to keep your daughter safe from someone even it that someone is their father.  This will not get any better you can not change him.  Please think that you need to have your daughter in the best environment.  This of her first.  <br>  <br>  I support you leaving 100%.  You seem strong enough to do this.  Raise that girl like she should be.  Show her you can be strong.|`|jfwmelYgaa	He's totally lying to you, My brother did the same kind of things to his g/f, I would say leave him and let him be a loser.|`|7SzADsVSaa	Leave him, I don't normally say upfront to just leave someone, but this man is no good for you. He will lie, cheat, and steal. I know another drug addict who would tell multiple girls how he cared for them and loved them. Its almost like they want you to find out about their other relationships, almost a form of self sabotage, and self destruction. Just like the drug addiction, they don't want whats good for them. They want turmoil and drama. Drop this man, hes no good.|`|b0g9hOdjaa	Walk, no RUN.  Do you want your daughter thinking that your relationship is a good one?  Children often follow in their parent's footsteps.  YOu deserve better.|`|1U8f6m2Paa	personally, i would not want that type of person around my children! <br>  <br>  you owe it to your daughter to get out of that situation!|`|cJhfSRn6aa	Probably that you turn to the internet and strangers to solve your personal problems.|`|XI7yXINjaa	well if this has been going on for a while now, then i advise you to just walk away. with your daughter. he knows that you'll put up with his $h!+  that's why he keeps doing this to you..and for starters no one accidentally puts there profileon a sex site...he looking for some *** that he doesnt have to commit to ...so good luck with that....and try moving on before things get worse. and you dont want to raise your daughter in that type of environment seeing her daddy take advantage of her mom, becasue when  she's older she'll think its ok for guys to do that to her...and the both of you deserve bett.(you and your daughter)..your boyfriend will realize that your no longer gonna put up with his BS and hopefully get his act together if not...atleast it'll no longer be a concern of yours.

d61eBHs2aa	You are both too immature for a relationship worth wasting any time or effort on. How do I know this? For one, he is acting like an 8th grader (maybe he is an 8th grader?). Secondly, you are questioning what to do when he is telling other girls the same thing he is telling you. Here's what you do:<br>  <br>  FORGET ABOUT HIM. Forget you ever met him, do not talk to him, don't answer his calls/texts/emails/IM's/whatever, just completely kick him to the curb and be done with it. Because if he is telling these other girls that he loves them, he is already done with you.<br>  <br>  The truth hurts, but a few years down the road he is going to be wishing he had been a better guy to you! Good luck!|`|707gOCvbaa	If he uses the word love so loosely then obvious it has no real meaning to him. So I assume he likes you  but he's not in  love with you and he also like these other girls. What he's doing is obviously flirting and it's disrespectful to you. Ask him to stop because it's harmful to your relationship  and if he keeps insisiting it's no big deal then I suggest you leave him before he dumps you. good luck.|`|AA10950966	Easy, ask him to stop. In a relationship the first thing should be respect. If he can't respect your wishes, then why would he respect you? If he says he's just "playing", then simply say "Oh so it's a game to you, then end it or I will." No need for him to whore around with girls, call him out on it and demand the respect you deserve.|`|AA11315360	Yeah if he is throwing the word love around like it is nothing then you cannot trust him! Break up with him. He clearly likes to flirt with too many girls and he probably doesnt know what love means and doesnt really love you. If he loved you he would reserve the word LOVE ONLY for you!|`|6286059824182c4e7ff0e287e5969887aa	i love u shouldn't be used so lightly and easily. you should dump him. he seems very immature...and if you got a boyfriend, surely you'll get other boyfriend easily. best of luck to you.|`|tJ6N1IyZaa	Yu need to get him in check cuz if he loves other girls then he has no feelings for you...You need to check that stuff out...For your own good|`|ze4Gt1araa	Break up with that guy he isn't worth it.<br>  <br>  He sounds really childish doing this.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|SNMgxLi9aa	Depending on how old you guys are, it shouldn't matter at all, just have fun and enjoy him with the time you all have.<br>  <br>  It takes people a long time to fully overstand what the word is, and heck,.... some people die without ever knowing a true meaning.<br>  <br>  If you all are young, let the young man learn, and don't hold him accountable to your expectations (even if you feel that you  personally understand love).  You'll only hurt yourself.|`|XI7yXINjaa	if he really loved you then he wouldnt be telling other girls he loves them. and if he tells you after telling them then he doesnt love any of you..not trying to be mean but im being honest..i say you move on before feelings get any deeper and he tries to walk all over you.|`|b9rDbQkQaa	i use to  do that, and after  a boy does that, is really hard for a girl to believe him, so,, . just talk to him, try to make him open up, and  ask his wut does he  really feel about u,,|`|hLmtDkU5aa	just ask him about it <br>  or start saying love you to other guys and see his reaction, if its bad then he means it to other girls, if hes fine about it he doesnt mean it|`|NBEuxzDBaa	maybe he LOVES them but he's IN LOVE with YOU|`|OwqIhc3Uaa	He sounds like a dumb little boy who tosses the L word around too casually.

ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	Honey, we all go through it.  Buy yourself some stretch mark cream, and use it EVERY DAY.  It will help.  Also, when you're home alone (or just hanging out with the baby), put on a pair of heels and do a booty dance in front of the mirror.  Five minutes EVERY DAY.  It will help you tone your legs, lose a few pounds, and most of all, you will FEEL sexy.<br>  <br>  If your husband SAYS he is still attracted to you, then he IS!  You have a man who thinks that you are BEAUTIFUL!  Just the way you are!<br>  <br>  So do something every day that makes YOU feel beautiful, and I promise, you will start to feel like a goddess, all the time.|`|7edl5u1oaa	I agree with the others who have said-don't let your confidence/positive attidude go down b/c that's what MAKES you sexy, girl. Not every man who has sex has a women with a perfect 10 body(and you know men like sex) but you know what---the woman has confidence and that's what makes them sexy to their man!! <br>  <br>  You know what---I've heard some men like a little belly! lol<br>  <br>  Start having confidence and show your husband how sexy you really are!!|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Yes I did think my wife was sexy after giving birth, but just like you she did not believe me.  The sad part is that our sex life went to zero and our relationship was destroyed.  If you love your man, do not let this happen to you.  Take your child for walks and get your figure back and confidence back - believe and trust your man.  Good Luck|`|fznvQptlaa	im also not a man but my husband would say much of the same as the nice Lady's husband.i also was small(108 lbs. 5'1") when i got pregnant and gained WAY more than the recommended amount. he loves the fact that after two children i am accepting of the changes that occurred with my body. i lost almost all of the weight but just don't look the same.i am left with quite a bit of stretch marks and a belly that isnt nearly as flat as previously. if u r confident in yourself he will find u much more sexy than if u always have something to say about ur belly being too big or u wish u could lose 10 lbs. due to the confidence i portray in my relationship, my husband always wants to be near me, touches me almost every time i walk past him and compliments me all of the time. he finds me very sexy and it does wonders for our marriage. if u at least portray confidence u will, for 1, start to believe it urself, and he will totally notice a difference in u.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	My wife has had eight babies and we are the parents to the seven remaining children.  I think she is more beautiful today than when I first met her.  She is amazing and I would stack her up against any other 30 something woman out there.  So stop doubting your husband, he does not see the stretch marks or loose skin, he sees the most gorgeous wife and mother in his life.|`|7LJ2Tx2Yaa	I am a married man.  I could care less about any weight issues or stretch marks.  Like the person before me said, it is all about attitude. <br>  <br>  Most guys are just happy to have sex.  I know I am not thinking about the looks of my wife, just trying to make her feel good.  <br>  <br>  It seems to just be in YOUR head.  It may take time to get over, but try and work on it.  He seems like he doesn't care about what you are obsessing over.|`|k4mGOlwsaa	sexiness isn't always the cover being confident is also sexy my husband has always told me when i bash on myself about my looks he says it very unattractive and hun ive had 4 kids so i know all about stress marks you just keep focused on losing the weight and toning your muscles i got bog with all my children and im a size 3 just eat right and exercises.|`|AA11646252	Yes just work your way back down so that you are happy though.  You worry a lot more about yourself than he does.  quit worring but still try to work back down to what you like.<br>  <br>  rd|`|IKXZZDH9aa	In the words of Kat Williams, "if your man has a problem with your stretch marks, I suggest you stop messing with B*******."<br>  <br>  You had a child so it's understandable that you gain weight and such.<br>  <br>  I love my wife, and 3 years after the baby she still is in need of losing some weight, but my love for her is nothing less. My concern for her health is greater because she does need to love weight and get in better shape, but the love doesn't change.<br>  <br>  Now if she just didn't give a damn and wasn't trying, that's a different story.<br>  <br>  Keep your head up and do what you can to lose the weight, and if throughout the process your husband loses his love for you, he never really love YOU to begin with, he loved your physique.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Allison, the first chic that responded should definitely get best answer!! She is VERY on point!!|`|gjaPNWbTaa	I know I'm not a man but I can tell you what my husband's answer would be.<br>  <br>  We all know what childbirth does.  If we weren't prepared to accept that and love you for who you are, we would never have children with you.  Sexiness is more about attitude than how tight your abs are.<br>  <br>  Seriously.  The most unsexy thing about you right now is not stretch marks - it's your attitude.  Being uncomfy and not wanting sex is going to drive a wedge between you and your husband.  Don't let this happen! Note Tony's answer below - seriously - DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN!<br>  <br>  Jump him tonight.<br>  <br>  My husband is an expert (trust me) on what makes women sexy... and he knows that a 50-lb overweight woman who's comfortable with herself and struts her stuff is FAR sexier than a bikini model who's worried about every little mole or imperfection.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	this was no reason to yell at u, shows he has no respect for u. his friend had no right to even be in the conversation. he must be hiding something from u.when abuse begins u kind of get a glimpse of whats in store for u in the future with him if u stay. maybe the friend u called knows something on him and he was afraid the friend would spill the beans. i would get out of this relationship, u don't have to put up with this from anyone.|`|SsfnitjXaa	I don't think you are in an abusive relationship.  You will have to ask them why it was such a big deal.  I would make myself scarce until they get a grip on reality.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I think your avatar is properly named, because you are flirting with disaster.  He obviously has some issues, I think you really need to evaluate this relationship and end it before it get violent.  Good luck.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Something is very wrong here.  Why didn't you have your friend's phone number?  Why did they have it and you didn't?  Is this friend his old girlfriend by any chance?  <br>  <br>  Maybe he thought you were going behind his back or something.  Something is not right here.|`|cdQryr7paa	I would say trust your insticts.<br>  So many women don't and pay dearly for it.<br>  Should you stay in a relationship when you are afraid?<br>  Time to go.<br>  Time to go, now.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	Get out of there before something bad happens.|`|lzooHi0Baa	I think you are too young, immature and naive.   There is no reason why you should allow anyone to act like that, unless you have strangled their pet.   Learn now that you are young that mental and physical abuse starts by using controlling behavior and yelling.  Do not tolerate it nor give anyone ever the power to do this to you.   You are in control of your life and they have to respect you.  I would consider changing boyfriend and roommate|`|AA11315360	Yeah that seems odd of them to treat you that way. Do not be with a guy who yells at you for a stupid reason like that. AND do not be with a guy who would let his friend scream in your face! That says that they have no respect for you.<br>  Dump him and tell him off. Tell him that clearly he has no respect for you if he would yell at you for asking someone for a phone number and to allow a friend to scream in your face!|`|jDT8yH7Raa	first of all, his friend had no business yelling at you for that.  if your boyfriend had an issue, he should of been the only one addressing you and you need to make that known to both of them.  as far as him getting mad, men are stupid sometimes, i can see my husband getting mad over something like that, but you know what he will get the fk over it, if he doesn't leave him behind, because he seems like the type that will get on your nerves over time|`|LJ2OqF1saa	say buh-bye......This was wrong of them to do, and your best bet is not to take it, if you let them get by with it now, they will do it again.<br>  <br>  This should be a warning sign to.|`|AA12382198	That's 2 different issues.<br>  <br>  If someone is yelling in your face....that's abusive.<br>  <br>  If he's acting irrational about something innocent....yes he's hiding something.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Sounds like something is going on.

Does he blame you for things he's done wrong? Are you afraid of him? If so, leave him. Get out while you're still mentally stable enough to have a successful relationship.|`|MZbQ5MPdaa	I think you'd better take a good look at this relationship.If he got this mad over something so small, what would happen if something important comes up? Take another look at this situation . I think you'll realize it's not a good relatonship at this time.|`|fef2399896e2e080792c38d047a07298aa	That is stupid. He's weird. I don't think you should see him anymore. Being married now, that is the dumbest thing to get mad about. You were just asking for a phone number. If my husband did that to me when we were dating, I'd have left him. Too much drama.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Why do people think it is ok to get in other people's faces like that when they have a problem with them?  I have had my share of that and I cant stand it. <br>  <br>  I would be concerned where this is headed.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|goY0JHzlaa	Run! And do so fast. Sounds crazy.|`|fznvQptlaa	VERY BAD SIGN! break it off. these things have a way of continuing if no control over your own self isn't taken...|`|RLoilwCNaa	Not cool. He should trust you more than that unless you've given him a reason not to in the past.|`|DtUy1IFmaa	I think you should be the one infuriated.  It's up to you what you want to do..I'm not sure if this kind of thing has happened in the past.  But personally, I never let my boyfriend raise his voice at me.  The one time he dared do that I was the one that let him have it.  The fact that his best friend got in on it is really messed up.  It's one thing for your bf to get mad and yell at you but for him to allow his best friend to yell at you and get in your face shows a complete lack of respect.  He's obviously ok with his friend getting in your face too.  If it happens again I'd leave his a**!

Maybe she's just shy. I'd go with her because you seem to have a strong relationship.

Don't risk breaking her heart on a chance.|`|bmi4Xlbfaa	If something isn't working anymore, you can't linger on it forever.

AA11315360	Find a nice old picture of her and have it blown up (make a bigger print of it). Or find a picture of you as a child with your mom and then make that picture bigger and put a frame on it. <br>  <br>  Or find an old picture of her husband (if he is dead) or her parents or anyone she loved a lot and then get a reprint of a good picture of them and frame it. You dont have to make it huge.<br>  <br>  OR if you have siblings get them together and go and have a professional picture taken together (get all dressed up). So she will have a new adult picture of her kids.<br>  Or if you are married gather your own family up get dressed up and have a professional picture taken.<br>  Here in the US we have department stores that will take professional pictures for very little money.|`|4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	<a href="http://www.iwantoneofthose.com/racing-grannies/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.iwantoneofthose.com/racing-gr...</a><br>  <br>  has to be one thing to get her. lol<br>  <br>  but theres some good stuff on that site, might want to go through it and have a look at some of the other stuff. that suggestion is more of a joke present. lol|`|6d6f8d43cca3847c2d3ce85aee05b599aa	It is my 60th next year and I want my family to recognize that I may be old, not dead.

nxEoR9CEaa	Wow my EX sure does get around.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	It would be wrong for you to get her fired just because you don't want to look at her anymore.  I can't believe you're old enough to drink with that attitude.  You  have to grow up and learn to choose your friends wiser.  Revenge is not the answer just move on without her in your life.|`|16vMIGPiaa	Get this:  you are in control of your own life.  <br>  If this other person is making messes that affect you, get away from her.  If that means changing jobs, then change.  Your sanity is more important.  If it means rebuilding your social network by picking and choosing those folks that will not invite her along, do so.<br>  <br>  You are not trapped.  You don't have to "always" have contact with her.  She could become just another person that you never see.|`|b0g9hOdjaa	You can't get someone fired.  My suggestion is to get a different job yourself.  <br>  <br>  As far as having the same circle of friends, you can always make separate arrangements for your weekly social life that don't include her.  If there is a party now and again, you'll just have to suck it up and stay in another room.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	So how long did you know Ashley before you got her the job and the boyfriend?  It doesn't seem like you would go to all that trouble to help her and make her happy if you knew her for a long time. You must have just met her right?<br>  <br>  If you didn't, you knew what she was about and you put her smack dab in the middle of your life.  Now you are having regrets.  How do you think it is going to be if you get her fired?  WW III.<br>  <br>  Don't ever mix business with pleasure.  First mistake you made.<br>  Good luck.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Everyone has a choice about with whom they choose to associate.  You could talk with your bf and agree that if she shows up at a gathering, you leave.  You may discuss this with other friends that are as sick of her as you are.  Generally ostracize her.  I would have to conclude that if your friends choose to continue to associate with her, they enjoy the drama and abuse.  Your choice - their choice.<br>  <br>  As for work, you can't get her fired.  She'll have to do that on her own.  You can be polite but not friendly at work and leave it as a professional working relationship.<br>  <br>  Next time, get to know someone better before insinuating them into your life to the extent you did with this one.  FYI she was an acquaintance, not a friend.  Learn the difference.|`|htWw0OlCaa	Funny, I have a devil in my life too, she is called my sister in law....<br>  Sounds like you have your hands full with this girl, I mean devil...LOL..<br>  I would start a rumor about her at work. She slept with the boss, or with some guy on the job. Put it in people's ear that she is a thief and will steal anything and everything. Some of the rumors might get back to her boyfriend and will cause problems for them as well.  Just say anything mean about her and let the rumors fly..LOL... I don't know if this has helped, but at least its something. Best wishes|`|wmOgseCgaa	You can't get her fired only she can do that. "Good things come to those who wait." She will get what is coming to her, people can't live lives like that and expect no reprocusions. <br>  Ignore her like she doesn't exist. You have to work together so keep a working relationship only, but if she comes to you with something non work related pretend shes not there.

It's a way of control for them, they obviously don't have it anywhere else in their life so this is their way of getting it. As much as you hate her have you ever thought of talking to her about it. Maybe she doesn't realize it or she's pushing everyone's boundaries seeing how far she can get. I sat down w/ my friend and told her how i felt, it got better for awhile but slowly went back to the way it was so i kept my distance, but we don't really share mutual friends so it was easier keeping her away. If everyone doesn't feel as though she's a true friend and after you talk to her she doesn't change then just leave her behind. She had her chance and screwed it up. You guys don't have to deal with her ways b/c of this. She can find a new set of friends if she can't respect the ones she has. For the job thing, you can't control that. you can only tell your boss to either put you on different shifts or quit your job but don't get her fired, tha'ts just going down to her level.
2JJLYSAKaa	If you look in your phonebook, you should find a number for AA or Al-anon.  Give them a call and talk to them.  You might want to go to a meeting and see what it is about.  These meetings are for family members of alcoholics.  There are many different ones and check to see if there is one for teens.  Go- even though you are not diredtly affected, you could gain some insight into what she is going through.<br>  <br>  You are a good friend and are concerned.  Just read 1/2 these posts here and you will see that girls are bff one second and hate each other the next.  What if she thinks you will spread things around school?  She is probably terribly embarrassed and would be humiliated if everyone at school knew her personal business.  <br>  <br>  After a meeting or two, talk to her about what you experienced and invite her to the next meeting.  It really helps.  The families & friends suffer so much from an alcoholic in their life.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Without knowing specifics it sounds like she needs professional help.  You might try talking to her and saying what you did here, omitting the part about your parents.  You can't make someone seek help, but you can lay the facts out straight and let her know you care and are there to help any way you can.  She's lucky to have a friend like you.

ODYrypwaaa	It is usually not ideal to have kids around for a lingerie party.  However, as a mom sometimes it can be hard to find a sitter.  She probably wants to be at your shower but cant get a sitter.  If there is no adult language or toys the child probably won't even notice the weird underwear.  :) Remember it is your shower but choose your battles. Plus she will probably bring a gift!  Don't miss out on a gift.  :)|`|9AobEMysaa	A lingerie shower is off limits for kids under 18. Her kids should not be anywhere close to the party. Also, she must not be a very good mother to want to take her kids to stuff like that. You tell her plain out that its your party and you invite who you want to and you don't think kids should b in the party and if she don't like it then that's on her she's just not a responsible as you are and clearly not ready to be a parent.|`|Fc4IySYjaa	First of all... it is inappropriate for children to be at a lingerie shower... also it is YOUR shower and you should decide on who you want there. <br>  <br>  I would just say, "you know, I love your kids and I cant wait to be there aunt but I just really want the adult ladies at the shower". Tell her that you can have two showers. One for the children to be there and one for the adults. <br>  I am having a shower in Vegas with just the adult women and then I am having another shower at home with everyone.|`|Drw4Gg1Daa	I would tell her it's inappropriate and it would make you feel uncomfortable if children were there watching you open thongs and sex toys...even if it's not going to be TOO risque, make it sound like it will be.  Have your fiance talk to her.  If she still wants to bring her children, maybe your fiance can babysit or take the kids out for awhile.|`|b06d2752947c332133b3d703ba6e1c3faa	Uh yeah that's kinda weird. Tell her that you will be VERY uncomfortable looking at thongs and bras with her kids watching.<br>  <br>  Or even better, tell her that there will be one of those ladies there who does the sex toy parties, showing off all sorts of toys, so as long as she doesn't mind explaining what a 12 inch silicone super veiner is or why that lady is wearing nipple clamps, you're cool with it. hehehe|`|o1Gg8HOOaa	I would just say, I would love to have them there but I am sorry this isn't really a kid-friendly party. Tell her you would feel a little uncomfortable with it and you would like to include them but if you do it for her you have to do it for everyone and you are considering this party to be adults only.<br>  Good luck to you!|`|J5zj8dWRaa	Tell her it's a lingerie party and you don't want young kids to be exposed to that type of thing.  That's part of being a good parent (or aunt, as the case may be).<br>  <br>  Can she afford a sitter?  ...If they did go to your party, is there another room they could amuse themselves in?|`|AA12150589	Maybe say something like, It's okay by me if the kids come, but maybe unwrapping kinky lingerie in front of a bunch of adults will lead to adult conversation! If she is okay with that happening, then it's okay by you if they come!|`|hKss8M9Raa	The only way it could possibly be ok for her kids to be there is if they are all under the age of 3 and would thus most likely be clueless as to what is going on.|`|AA12044219	Its weird. Why not just tell her that you told others NO children and that it would make them feel bad to bring hers. Assuming you told others anyway.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Tell her you wouldn't feel comfortable with children around during that sort of shower and that you hope she understands why!|`|aipChC3haa	Tell her it's kinda innapproriate for the kids, so maybe she'll understand?<br>  If not, tell her to kiss your @ss because w/ kids there it will be NO fun at all!|`|9tf9VF9naa	tell her on the face that kids are not allowed . if she creates a drama  warn her never to repeat it.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	tell her you don't want to traumatize them.|`|80b3fd718cbac3bab6c1365ad47cd447aa	Maybe you could provide her with a sitter for the duration of the party?|`|mCbhjcLuaa	That is beyond weird.|`|7S1bMK2Caa	Tell her it's adults only!|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Totally inappropriate party to bring children, even if they are put in another room.  It sounds like your SIL wants to attend and may not have somewhere to leave her kids or is one that won't leave them somewhere.  I would just tell her plainly that it is not an appropriate occasion for children and that you and the other guests would rather no children in attendance.  She will have to get a sitter or stay home.  And no, it's not just you, it's weird.|`|4POGapREaa	Text her back & say that because of the nature of the party (sexy lingerie) it's not a kid friendly environment & nobody else attending is bringing kids & they had to make arrangements around that so it might rub some people the wrong way if she was the only one allowed to bring them.|`|hLohtlPEaa	Lingerie shows are where women get together and talk about everything but the kids. It's not appropriate. So what if she makes a big deal about it. None of the other guests called and asked if they could bring their kids.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	It's definitely weird.  Hopefully the kids can play outside or in a bedroom - somewhere completely out of sight from the lingerie party.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Yes just say its not appropriate for kids and you would rather no children were there due to the nature of the party. Say you would understand if she could not make it but would she want a brochure etc.,|`|uBssj3Znaa	tell her no as a lingerie shower is no place for children. Who cares if she makes a big deal out of it. She should be adult enough to know better|`|R7b150Iyaa	Completely weird AND inappropriate.  And obviously, she's not a very good parent if she's even considering it.  Common sense, even a regular bridal shower with toasters and towels as gifts is still not a child-friendly activity.  Not to mention a lingerie shower.  Definitely tell her that there will be no kids there and it would be inappropriate to have them checking out the bedroom goodies you wind up getting.  Is this your fiance's sister?  Maybe he can advise you on how best to answer.  Or just pretend you thought it was a joke, text her something like "Lol!  Getting your kids started on lingerie early, I see! (hopefully she has a daughter for this to freak her out).  Sorry, no kids though =)"  If you say it in a joking way, she can't really get offended.<br>  <br>  I still can't believe she even asked though!  How rude!<br>  <br>  Good luck =)|`|c7c42fcd2fd4b62ba49207bebbdb931daa	Yeah, that is a little weird.  What you could do, is message her back saying that you've already said no to somebody else that is coming (if that's applicable), and tell her that it then wouldn't be fair to say yes to her.  If you can't use that as an excuse, then you probably should just tell her that it's more of an adult thing, with adult jokes, so you don't feel it's appropriate to have them there.  If she gets all dramatic, too bad, lol.  It's your party.  Be strong!  : )|`|l43NSgHyaa	I would tell your sister-in-law that this is an adults only event.   A lingerie shower is no place for children and I would let her know that.  Also, emphasize how uncomfortable having children present, for an adult-themed party, is going to make a lot of people feel.  <br>  <br>  A dramatic family or not, your SIL is crazy for bringing her kids along.|`|sGP6s7uraa	It's a lingerie party.  It's kinda inappropriate to have children looking a thongs, teddies, pastease and bustiers.  Not to mention the other bedroom 'goodies.' I would text her back and say that exact thing with a smiley face at the end.|`|zmqN0M86aa	Um, yeah that's very weird and totally inappropriate.  Tell her to get a sitter.  Even if she makes a big deal out of it, she'll look like a fool.  Who in their right mind brings kids to things like that?|`|AA11380378	Tell her that it would be an adult environment and adult conversation and items will be around and that it will not be the appropriate place for children.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	A lingerie shower is something that kids don't need to attend.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	Simply say "the LINGERIE party is a ADULT event, sorry" that's it. If she has a huge problem with it, she can just not come.
Jo2DfRzaaa	friend is an umbrella term for me.  <br>  at this point in my life - i have my sis, my mom, and my neighbor in terms of active friends.  i do have other people who i know i could turn to should i need them and they could turn to me as well.  that number brings my total to about 6 friends.  the extra 3 are the ones who aren't like me - not married, no kids, no mortgage.<br>  its circumstances for me.  its harder to relate to people who aren't like me at this point, at least i think so since i'm still up to my elbows in poopy diapers and they have never been there.  my life revolves around my kids and this life.  i'm hoping once they get older i can be more social again and have all kinds of friends.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	all of them.<br>  <br>  I'm the odd ball and everyone else is alike|`|2LpWgU20aa	ironically the friends that share similar interests/traits as me are my casual friends i dont really hang out with but talk to in school. my best friends are the total opposite of me yet we get along best!|`|Krs6O0T7aa	one, and his name is timmy. hes so quiet and yet extremely funny, but im really talkative and i dont care abt making ppl laugh much. but hes a good friend.|`|PN7XMglOaa	All of them .

I've known her since I was 16, and honestly we have kinda led different lives since I became a mother...even though she was already one at that point.<br>  I can make friends with just about anyone honestly..but I just can't stand it when people act certain ways when they have kids.|`|vbedfwsuaa	All my friends r completely different personalities but we all seem to get along well. but occasionally there could be small fights or misundestandings, which r sorte out easily.|`|UvHn5u3Yaa	I benefit greatly from others' points of view on different projects, as in work and on different life experiences, as in friends. For example, you may enjoy a chat with a friend who doesn't have children with her point of view career-wise.  Others who don't have children enjoy point of views from mothers about family and life values. I have a few friends that are very stern about some opinions which is interesting to have another point of view, but it is also hard to work with and be friends with people who are just too stubborn to compromise.  I have seen couples and friends work out because they are polar opposites. I have quite a few friends that are not much like me at all, different points in their lives and careers, opinions, but nonetheless I enjoy conversation, experiences and discussions with them, no matter their age, career choice, etc. It helps give me perspective in this world and life.|`|x2l1sK5waa	well, as i'm only 19 this year, my experience with people differ than my age is not much. =) usually, im surrounded by people who are around my age. but i'm doing my hospital training now, so i'm living in this kinda boring state.<br>  hmm..how to say. their way of thinking is kinda conservative (not all of them but mostly) n lotsa more.. but still, i manage to fit in 'tho not 2 well. it's kinda hard for me at first because i feel like totally opposite, n i dun wanna be a hypocrte. <br>  but then, i figured out that in order to b friend, i dun have to imitate them or try to think like them. as long as i care about their feeling and and be a gud friend, i think it's ok
NuUdCz0Laa	Okay, my last answer for the day and I saved it for you.  A date festival could be romantic, as long as there is lots of wine and fair maidens dancing in toga's.  Although I draw the line at the hairy old men dancing in toga's, plus I hear that dates cause gas, so beware.  Hopefully this will be a weekend full of wine and young maidens and maybe you will join in the dance, I hear table cloth make good toga's.  Have fun and a great weekend.  Hope to see you and your zany questions next week.  Give Skippy a big kiss.|`|uBssj3Znaa	oh dates as in the fruit ... I was slightly confused. Why not go and have a good time.

You should have kept quite and eventually 'B' would have found out. Because its seeming like your a bad friend if both of them were your bestfriend and then you turned on one for the other. I would know because this has happened to me before but I stayed with the person that was talking mess and got in a fight with the other. To keep this from happening to you I sugesst that you talk to both of your Bff's and try to have them work it out. Do not chose sides that will just make things worse.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped =)
bhRuOeBpaa	He probably likes the other girl he sits with and doesn't want her to get the wrong idea about his friendship with you and your friend.  Give him time and space and I'm sure he'll come hang out with you again.|`|UF9MVdSXaa	He more than likely likes that girl. My ex guy friend stopped hanging with me and my friends when he started liking this girl. But now he doesn't even hang with us anymore.|`|lH2UOet1aa	My opinion; grow up. <br>  It isn't that hard to figure out that he's interested in another girl...<br>  very possibly the one he leaves you two for at lunch.<br>  No lie. I wouldn't even consider that he wants to be your friend anymore. Make new friends?|`|Ukw1JUNcaa	It seems as though it's because of this girl he's been hanging out with lately. She could be telling him she doesn't like him hanging out with the two of you (girl conflicts... you know how that goes), or he doesn't want to look like he chats up lots of girls and look bad for this girl he probably likes. You can either talk to him and tell him to explain to this girl that you guys are just friends and have been since when you met him, or you can stop interacting with him and give him time to sort it out on his own. Good luck!|`|811ea9ca2ab8061aef7359c396ed9139aa	maybe he likes the other girl. he cant always be with you two. but talk to him. communication is key.|`|I3jYOT9haa	Talk to him about it.

ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	LOL, I read an answer the other day.  Someone had asked a serious question about a rough relationship and a possible divorce...<br>  <br>  And this girl gives a bizarre, long-winded answer, and at the end of it, she writes: "But I don't know what I'm talking about, because I'm only 15."<br>  <br>  I was trying to figure out WHAT she was doing in the "Marriage and Divorce" section!<br>  <br>  So, yes, I think knowing a person age will help you to gauge how seriously you should consider their advice.|`|yotUSWcIaa	No, I don't think so at all.<br>  <br>  Surely if people take the time to read your question and answer it, you could have the decency to read it and form your opinion on it. You could get a more sensible answer from some twelve year old than some twenty-eight year olds [as an example]<br>  You can rule the answer valid or reliable or whatever else without knowing the age.|`|peybb4Foaa	If advice is good , why would you care?<br>  Im amazed by how even some 13 year olds can give nice advice lol<br>  I remember when my mom was crying about our dad leaving ( i was 8) and i was like " dont cry mom , there are thousands of them out there"<br>  lol|`|3ee8101ef611dcb2fe20c82dfe728d6caa	If they ask, I tell them, but who's to say I'm not lying?

I'm going to be 44 next month.|`|4POGapREaa	I know it's annoying when the teeny boppers want to intervene but we (as adults) complicate things so much that sometimes the kid with the innocent perspective has the answer right away.  And some of the older people on here are just douchebags with zero intentions of helping anybody.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I appreciate hearing from people of any age.  All advice is worthy of listening to.|`|zL1sggpCaa	Well, you can receive all the advice in the world... its what and how you use it that matters.<br>  <br>  AND, to be honest... some of the things my children say (who are 5 & 3) make more sense sometimes because its so simply honest - than a lot that comes from us.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	What's the point? They can lie. The best way to guesstimate people's age (at least their maturity level) is from the answers themselves. If a 14-year-old Jonas Brothers fan gives good advice - who are we to bash them?|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Sure but how would you verify the information?|`|u1uECuFNaa	Hey, one of those guys is kinda cute!<br>  <br>  :)|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Usually it is pretty easy to figure out their age by the way they answer your questions.  They are either rude or have no f-ing idea what they are saying.  Although, I have been surprised at some of the older answers and the lack of experience and knowledge that they have, giving the same off the wall answers.  So I guess you just have to read them all and use the ones that help you the most, with age not being a issue.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	I think it is very easy to tell when someone is not old enough to give that type of advice. As a matter of fact, it is easy to tell if someone is under 25 years and their logic and approach. Therefore, I dismiss those answers when asking mature questions.|`|gfHutvEFaa	it's just advice you're looking for, not absolute science. Doesn't matter if someone is 14 or 40, take the advice for what it is.|`|uBssj3Znaa	no not at all ... experience tends to lead to better advice, that is true. But there are plenty of people who are older that don't know sh*t|`|UgcPxd4maa	I think so, for sure!!! These teens on here think they know everything!|`|oojO4WAraa	It is an open forum.  No.  People shouldn't have to give their ages.|`|ByUS0k8waa	lol... that's so funny. I agree though. I don't want my questions answered by teens either.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	hey, i belong to Jonas Brother's fan club. <br>  <br>  i guess that explains my answers.

And enjoy ur time being young since we all only have one chance for that =D =P<br>  <br>  Anywayz, best of luck to u!!!|`|nfBr2dpZaa	First off, im a 17 year old guy whos been to places in his life where i felt the exact same way, although luckily not any more.<br>  Hey come on, is life that rubbish?<br>  <br>  <br>  First off, ok, so youre failing all your subjects, but are you going to just sit on the computer complaining about, or are you going to make a resolve to work harder after the half term. Youre clearly clever if you were 'meant' to be an a grade student, maybe you just need to apply yourself more.<br>  On doing virtually nothing this half term, thats not your fault if you feel like you have no friends, honestly i empathise with you so much because a couple of years ago i was in such a messed up situation getting bullied horrificly at school, no friends, knew no girls, no real interests, went to these rubbish camp things in the holidays, had loads of spots too therefore zero confidence was such a messed up situation, ive been there and done that when it comes to this, and the memories of it are still there, though fading slowly, all I can say is, Hang on in there!, things do get better you dont think they will but they do and so what about this guy? if he thinks your boring and weird why do you give a f*** about him, let alone 'love' him, you should forget about him and concentrate on finding a guy who likes you for yourself, also, someone whos boring wouldnt be on here asking these questions, its because youre thinking about things that you are<br>  Hope this helps|`|r8hF8Z7Daa	Heey dont worry i got that feeling it goes away to be honest its mostly hormones just keep your chin up, we all go through rough patches, thats life try and think positive keep your mind on positive things|`|A3BoPYM0aa	yeah seems like you need a visit from mr. razor...
JEg9THbNaa	The only thing i can tell you is to try and move on.  if he doesn't want more that's his loss.  if i were you i would get out of the house and do a lot of fun things with a big group of friends.  smile and laugh a lot too. it's corny but laughter really is the best medicine.<br>  <br>  this is a tough thing you're going through right now, believe me i've been there. but don't worry it really does get better. hang in there and remember to laugh! :)|`|xHvfOSlKaa	if he dont want a relationship dont force it apon him. if he say he loves you and he really mean it he will want relation. dont rush into it cause  yall relationship will not last long.|`|G2QNC22eaa	you cant change the way you feel about some one it can only change by it self if you find some one different that your interested in your feelings will not change you cant make them like another guy
sr7jX2wYaa	The  reason  many cops  get divorced  is  because of  the hours  they work, & it  leaves very little time for a relationship, or home life. You have not been with this a guy for any real length of  time, so if you are  really interested in him, & I assume you are  by asking  what to do, Then  Just text him, & tell him to have a fun & relaxing trip, & You look forward to hearing about  it when  he gets back & has time to get together with you. Don't push anything, basically just let him know you understand how hectic  his schedule can be, & just  let you know when it would be a good time for him to get together with you, & you will try to make sure  you clear your schedule  to make the time to be  with him. <br>  It gives him space, without pressure, & lets him know you are interested enough  to try & make  the time  to see him when it is good for him. But that you are not just sitting around waiting for his call. which will also be a relief  for him, & makes you a little more of a challenge & guys like that*|`|1F6KJt0oaa	Go with a dream.  Tell him you had this crazy dream about him (sexual in nature of course).  See how he responds.  It sounds like he is at least interested by no means feeling exclusive to you but has a busy schedule with not as much social life and a hard job.  Not to mention being a little older (even though not so much to be old and gone but enough that almost no sleep the night before going to a tough job in the morning is a lot harder).  Try to work around his schedule I think he is into you but he isn't just head over at least not yet.  If he was he wouldn't be going to Miami alone.  Patience is key at this point even if that answer sucks to you right now.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	He is obviously interested.  You asking him to confirm this is crazy.  You want to ask him if he is interested in you?  Don't do that.  Then you will be needy, clingy and need reassurance when it is perfectly clear.  If you keep this up, you will push him away.<br>  <br>  You want to move on?  What, are you looking for a committed relationship after 3 dates?  I'd back off and chill out.  He is going to be there when he has the time.|`|CFFxtileaa	I don't quite understand what the question you are asking is but it looks like you are both very interested in each other and I think you should start dating! (My opinion) You obviously aren't too 'clingy' or 'annoying' because he texts you aswell as you texting him, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about as he did say you weren't annoying, maybe you should move onto the next level and start communicating with him in a different way, for example calling him, instead of texting. It looks like you both really like each other and I think it would be good to take a chance and ask him if he's interested. <br>  He said that he's 'crazy about you', I think that is great!<br>  <br>  I just realized what your question is.. I'm not really sure.. Does it really matter what you say? I suggest saying something along the lines of   'Good, I don't want to annoy you all the time by texting you' or 'Good, I thought I was being a bit annoying by texting you all the time'<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with this guy and hope it all goes well<br>  <br>  From Kitty xx|`|hp9RGv7iaa	You need to take it for what it is. Sounds to me like you want something serious and he doesnt. He is a man of course if you threw it at him he wasnt gonna turn it down. Be his friend while you still can be and nothing more unless he stats that he wants more.|`|fb5d7O6Saa	Well bottom line, people make time for what they want to make time for. If I were you, I'd ask straight up if he was interested. You're a grown woman and if you want an answer, then ask. All he can say is yes or no. If he says yes then see how it goes from there. If he says no then move on. Don't ever make assumptions. You know that saying, right? When we assume we make an *** of ourselves.|`|ooXzW8Hdaa	sorry, but i was too lazy to read all of that but from what i see is a crush since you're too nervous about being perfect, BUT, SMS dating from my point of view is worse than online dating and that's not a good way to get a boyfriend and besides, 4 years difference in age is ok, but 6?! I say move on.|`|fR2Geezcaa	He sounds like he is concentrating more on his career right now and not looking for a committed relationship. His concentrating on his career may just be temporary, he sounds like a great catch!<br>  <br>  If this is what you looking for then great. If you require someone there everyday right now he might not be the right one for you. I think I would be more patient and see what develops.

Learn to be comfortable with yourself.  You're not yet.  It takes some doing and personal security.  You may be looking at friends as validation of yourself.  It's really not necessary.  There are loads of things that you can do alone and happily!  For me, restaurants - eating alone - is a thing I don't like, but even bringing a book helps that!  I value sincerity and people that I love.  I'd rather do things on my own and cherish the time with those I love than fill my short life with drama and insincerity.<br>  <br>  Learn to be comfortable in your own skin :)|`|s3cvyLYtaa	loneliness.<br>  <br>  why be "friends" with people who don't really care for me|`|SOx6VwYCaa	Loneliness because then you know you have people who love you , and then that feeling of being lonely goes away.

U1BHQYngaa	First off, thank you for answering my question, i really appreciate it.<br>  <br>  Now, I HAVE been in this situation before, last year. I started to like this guy who was dating some girl, and he was telling me that he wants to be with me, and he wants my affection. And i told him that, "you need to be faithful to your girlfriend, you don't need sh*it from me, if your girlfriend wont 'put out' or isn't showing you love or affection, dump her and find someone else".  i talked to him a week later and he told me he cheated on his gf, and "did" some other girl... i told him he was a low life, and now his ex-gf id suicidal and depressed. i feel so bad for her...<br>  <br>  Guys do this because some of them are just with us girls for a little, "getting jiggy with us"... girls do it to... But anyone who would cheat on their bf/gf IS a lowlife, and are so sad with themselves that they need to hurt other people, even the people that "supposivly" mean the most to them.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  also my boyfriend always makes me feel beautiful inside, and i adore him with all my heart, and he tells me the same. he's always telling me he loves me, and how much he cherishes and adores me, he tells me he'll give me the world, and i agree and tell him the same. i have fallen head over heels and i'm scared of getting hurt.<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  btw, my name is Kelsey, and if u'd like to talk, email me: xxalicexxcullenxx@rocketmail.com|`|lSGNCKitaa	he's playing with you. if he liked you he would be a man and break up with his girlfriend.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Everybody wants people to like them, and they feel flattered when given attention by someone else.

I was single at the time and not really looking to date because I was heartbroken.. But I was showering a female friend of mine in affectionate action, because...mostly because I was desperate.  I just wanted a girl to realized 'hey, you're a nice guy'.  <br>  <br>  Why he would be doing so...maybe his relationship is very rocky and he's not getting the attention he craves from his girlfriend, so he's looking to you to get that.  Maybe he's just a really nice guy and wants to be acknowledged as such.  Either way, his intentions are probably pure.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Affection from a friend is different from affection from a boy/girlfriend.<br>  <br>  The fact he wants your affection doesn't mean he wants anything more than your friendship.|`|E4BCJkWYaa	he's sleazy and is taking advantage of your close friendship.|`|qkuMPSczaa	He wants you to make more moves towards him first.

He doesn't need your affection, as he has a girlfriends who can give it him.  Instead he WANTS you affection as he has true feelings for you.  But the problem is he wants it both ways, and you seem like a good upstanding woman who wont settle for his cheating ways.  He doesn't sound like the kind of guy you want a relationship with.  sorry|`|lUuxrGAtaa	It sounds like ur guy frriend didn't neccesarily want you to fall in love with him, he may have feelings for you but he DOES have a girlfriend. Just don't get in between them, but make sure this guy knows that you have fallen for him and that he needs to stop making you feel like this. Either be a best firend, or be a boyfriend. Its hard I know......its happened to me, and i chose the worng way out. Good luck|`|ukmtA1dHaa	Its sounds like he is just as confused as you, but does like you, cuz like you said, why would he look for your affection when he has a girl.

He is afraid to tell you because of how you might react and/or what you might say.<br>  <br>  And he is a little confused.  He obviously has feelings for both of you.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would only want affection from one person, my fiance.  Affection like what you're describing should only come from one's mate.  Everyone else can give me a handshake, or a hug at most.  (I'll still accept kisses from my mother and other female relatives lol!)<br>  <br>  If I were you, I would have a polite talk with your friend.  I would tell him that he needs to get his head screwed on straight and decide who he wants to be with.<br>  <br>  In a way, this is not fair to you.  It kinda keeps you hanging while there are probably other guys out there that you might want to date.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, no matter what happens, the two of you can remain friends.|`|sItCfd7Qaa	If he is will to show affection to you and still be with his girlfriend it not right. It is not worth getting affection from someone who is not willing to but the time into the relationship but have the rewards. I would keep him as a friend and find someone else that is willing to be in a relationship.  He has to choose who he wanted to be with more.
f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	All it comes down to is what both people are looking for at that time.   Dressing like a whore and hanging out in bars doesn't give off a "relationship material" kind of vibe though.|`|POHWTDPRaa	There are no right or wrong signals. What went wrong was that your friend somehow failed to realize that the guy was only looking for Ms. Right for the Night.

It's what insecure girls with no self-esteem *think* to do to "get a man". <br>  <br>  Acting is the opposite of the signals that call bf material.<br>  <br>  Next thing is that girls don't "get" (compete for) guys - that whole idea is biology upside-down. <br>  <br>  Girls *select* from among the available suitors. The lucky suitor gets to become immortal, in a manner of speaking, when he passes on his genes. The girl is nothing less than guardian of this "gateway to immortality". <br>  <br>  The girl's JOB is designer of the next generation of humanity through her *wise* selection.<br>  <br>  There's a concept called "value attribution" - means if you're selling hard, you must not be worth much. People get that intuitively. A BMW sells itself - a used jalopy doesn't. <br>  <br>  Which are you (making yourself into)?<br>  <br>  There's an idea to "get" a bf - as if the bf is a pair of shoes - a commodity - a thing of value. In that equation, you're a consumer and you are trading something - what? And, he's the value and you're - not.<br>  <br>  That's called being underdog and worthless and it goes places that aren't fun.<br>  <br>  Or, you could be the commodity - and the bf could be competing for you because you have value - which only works if you don't abuse the attitude - but I think you can get the idea...<br>  <br>  You start a relationship by bringing something to the table - by being worth something to begin with - in your own mind - and because you're ABOUT SOMETHING more than "gotta geta bf".<br>  <br>  What's your HOBBY? What do you KNOW about? What ACTIVITIES do you do?<br>  <br>  If there are already some good answers to those questions, then LOOK THERE for guys who will have some substance and already share a common interest. If there aren't any good answers to those questions, then get busy and make some.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

J5zj8dWRaa	Your ideas are unique - in the best possible way.  You've really thought this through (which is much better than some people I can name).  I'm assuming this fits right into you and your fiance's personalities.  Good for you!  It's "your day", so it should be something YOU enjoy - not necessarily something you're paying off for the next year.<br>  <br>  *  The sitting-on-hay-bales idea - You might want to give the female guests a heads-up, since hay isn't all that great for certain materials.  You could always have other seating options available, or have a few blankets ready just in case.  How about picnic blankets for those who want it?<br>  <br>  *  The music - Have a decent speaker for your ipod, and it should be perfectly fine.  Put the ipod on shuffle, play the music you like.  That's all that counts, in the end.  Nowhere does it say "you must have dancing at a wedding"...  But don't be surprised if at least one couple spontaneously decides to dance along to a song they like.  : )<br>  <br>  Entertainment - Since you're going to be outside and you'll have the room, why not set up horseshoes or croquet or other lawn games you like?  Depending on the dress code you choose and the likes/dislikes of your guests, you could even consider putting up a volleyball net or having a soccer ball ready to kick around.  (Go as all-out as you and your fiance are comfortable with, not what other tell you is appropriate.)<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|2zHxgg5eaa	I think you can set up some games for any kids that are going, and the adults can have a try if they feel like. Usually (I think) the adults prefer talking to one another, so the kids (if any) would be busy eating and playing and the adults eating and talking.|`|AA11603468	We had something kind of similar because we had a destination wedding, but then had a big party a few months later at home (I mean locally, not at our home)...we served a similar menu, including wedding cake, but because it wasn't an actual wedding reception (just a celebration of our marriage, if you get what I mean), we wanted to make it more of just a fun party then the typical wedding reception.<br>  <br>  Besides the food, we did offer games for people to play. They were a huge hit! We had musical chairs for the adults and another round for the children. We had a water balloon toss, and also a free throw contest (2 groups again for kids and adults) and we gave prizes to the winners. The games were a ball, and those who chose to participate really got a lot of laughs out of it. We also had something we call Tricky Trays (I know it goes by lots of names elsewhere) where we brought back a bunch of stuff from our honeymoon, and as each person came in, we gave them tickets (gave, not sold) they could put into the cup beside these prizes. We made sure we had things for the kids and the adults like Crayola kits and bottles of rum and all kinds of things. I could not believe how well that went over! I never had such a captive audience before!!!! We had a dj, so people danced, but it was also nice just for background music. Besides that, we had one of those inflatable bounce houses delivered fro the kids to jump around in. They sure loved that one!<br>  <br>  We decorated by blowing up pictures from our wedding and placing them all over the venue so people could see the wedding even if they couldn't be there in person. We also had some small pix of the wedding on the individual tables. <br>  <br>  No matter what you do, your guests will enjoy themselves. They're there for a party, and it sounds like you're on the right track. I hope you get at least some useful ideas from this, but either way, have a great time!|`|n1AIrlfbaa	That is such a wonderful idea!  Fun, cozy, relaxed atmosphere- a perfect way for both families to get to know each other!<br>  I would suggest the type of games that you would see at family reunions, but I'm not sure how your guests will be dressed.  You don't want them to ruin their nice clothes.  Maybe suggesting that they bring a change of clothes?<br>  <br>  Tug-of-War (bride's side vs. groom's side maybe?)<br>  That one game where you have people spin around with their forehead on a baseball bat and then race to the finish line<br>  Corn holes<br>  <br>  Ever think about a bonfire at the end of the evening?|`|4POGapREaa	I've never even been to a place like you described with barns & horeshoes but it sure sounds FUN!!  I don't normally like a huge deviation from a classy wedding & I can't stand themes especially but for some reason I totally love where you're going with this.  It sounds really cool, and laid back, and warm, and inviting.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of the galvonized tubs for drinks & the tablecloths sound perfect for what you're going for.  My ONLY problem is the bales of hay.  I've only sat on one of those one time (at a weird horse racing thing) and immediately got bit by a spider.  Plus, it was poking my butt & sticking to my pants, etc.  Not good.  <br>  <br>  As for the food, I'm a big fan of BBQ & I grill all Summer long but I think you might be going just a little too simple for a reception.  Hot dogs & burgers are more birthday party to me.  You can do grilled shrimp on skewers, various sausages that can be cut up & plated with toothpicks for appetizers, have some dips like spinach with a baguette, grilled fish is always amazing, grilled potatoes with a rosemary garlic marinade, grilled asparagus with butter sauce, skewers of steak with onions, mushrooms, tomatoes.  Do some fruit & veggie trays for snacking too.  You have lots of options with grilling.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	Food:<br>  Get some chicken or beer-boiled (substitute half the boiling water with beer_ ribs on your menu.<br>  <br>  Flowers:<br>   depending on how many tables you have, it actually might be cheaper for you to get flowers wholesale online<br>  <br>  Alternate gingham and white table clothes.<br>  <br>  Setting up games is perfectly fine<br>  <br>  ipod is fine too
naequcqlaa	Your atty. is absolutely rite!  You CAN serve him w/a letter requesting he remove them w/in 30 days & he has to comply w/the request.  Things that are requested legally have to be abided by, & this certainly is NOT a request of something that's not impossible for him to do.  You KNOW he's just doing this as some kind of a "pay back" & just something he knows is getting under your skin.  I would say that's the ONLY reason he's going against your wishes.  No one has to accept the unacceptable & that's about what it all boils down to w/him.  In this case, your soon to be ex is totally wrong in his way of thinking.  Just stay strong a bit longer & know that they WILL in fact be removed soon.  Also remember, with His help, all things are possible!  That I KNOW you have...:)|`|C6lHPX25aa	I would do the letter like your attorney suggested --- sure, give him until the end of March, that's no big deal.............<br>  <br>  If he doesn't get his stuff by the first of April --- put it outside (letting him know in that letter this would be what happens if he doesn't get his possessions, of course)............Since you have been waiting this long for the divorce, your estranged husband must realize your marriage is 'over'...........No reason for his belongings to keep taking up space in your home - not really..............<br>  <br>  You can always ask your attorney about this suggestion................<br>  <br>  Hope it helps................|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Your attorney is right. You have to give him a notorized letter stating he has 30 days to pick up his belongings. If he doesn't, then you move them to a storage unit and make sure you put his name and your name on it.. (since your both still married wink wink)...and then give him the bill to pay....If the bill isn't paid...the storage unit will keep his items and then auction them off. He will have to go pay the storage fee's to get his stuff back.<br>  <br>  Make sure you give a copy of the storage papers to your attorney and your ex. That way you can say.. Look.. I was upfront, I gave you time to get them, you didn't, I moved them for you into a storage unit so you didn't have too and now your own your own...|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Move them all into a storage unit and make him pay the bill if he wants his stuff.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Is this the biggest issue you have in your whole life?  Storage?<br>  <br>  Good grief.<br>  <br>  Until the marriage is dissolved and property divided, he is entitled to HALF the house.   Be grateful he's not actually using his full half.
kq5ZNYNVaa	you shouldnt be a sl*t. now pay for it.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	yes. stalking. nip it in the bud.<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Call the cops!|`|jvvTybx4aa	Whoa he is really weird! Since your're going on a double date next week, your guy friend to talk to him and tell him to back off cuz its wayyyy too muchh.|`|dsf5hGGnaa	Damn maybe start ignoring him and start going around one of your guy friends alot and this guy will back off he sounds creepy. Just keep your distance and stop talking to him he will get the picture.|`|TAS1vdr9aa	tell him that you're not ready for a relationship. don't answer him as often when he texts you, and i'm sure he will get the hint. If you are scared for your safety talk to your parents an adult figure at school. DO NOT let him pressure you into doing anything that you don't want to do ! Maybe he thinks if he tells you he loves you, you will be willing to take the relationship to the next level. You're very young and smart for realizing he is being strange ! <br>  <br>  Good luck hun ! Be safe !|`|YFTZM86maa	You need to be honest and tell him your feelings.  DO NOT continue to flirt and make him think everything is ok.  If you want to still give this a try, he needs limits like 10 texts and 5 calls a day, or whatever you are comfortable with.  If you do not want to continue, say you are sorry but you can not continue because you are too young and not willing to have such a serious relationship.  you can still have the option of being friends and talking at school.  If anything else happens and you need to cut ties all together, then make it very clear to him.  Use parents and teachers etc as support when you need it.  Do not try and get your friends in the middle of the situation.  Do not try to make him jealous nor lie to him as that will make it worse.  If he "loves" you already, then he is either insecure or wanting to use you for his benefit alone.  He does not seem to have your needs in mind at all.<br>   Being honest is always your best course of action in life....start now!|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	Go with the Flow!|`|cLGVSuFqaa	tell him to calm down<br>  and sort himself out<br>  he sounds really weird|`|8vfCRg7Caa	tell him you wanted his avice on another guy that you like. And ask him if he thinks hes worth dating or something like that. Then he know you banished him to the friendship level and he wont call you anymore. And when you see him at school ignore him. he will get the point.|`|BeLcoS6Aaa	avoid him. if you know he walks a certain way to class, you walk the other way. when he calls you, answer and say, hey im really busy right now, ill call you when i get a chance. dont respond to his texts or emails at all. and if he keeps blowing up your phone, as a friend with a real mature voice to act like your mom and say that you are grounded from the phone. and if he does catch up to you at school, just start walking fast and say, oh im running late, we'll catch up later. bye and speed off|`|LmFGYK7laa	calmly tell him how u feel and that u think its going too fast and tell him to back off a little ... i mean ya it does seem like it's going a little too fast ... if u like him then tell him that and see wat he says ... if he keeps pressuring u then tell him u don't want to see him anymore .... but if u like him thats fine but tell him wat u really think of wat he's doing and don't pretend ur okay with it cuz he might want to do other stuff that u dont want to do or arent ready for ....|`|x1VLBHOJaa	Oh dear it does sound like this guy is going a little OTT. I hate it when guys do that, its so creepy and off-putting. You need to tell him straight that its going way too fast and you're not interested in being his girlfriend. 60 texts and 37 missed calls, wow, he is obsessed! Tell him to back off immediately. DON'T go on the double date, that is a disaster waiting to happen. I hope all goes well for you, at least you are sensible and can see this is all a bit too much.|`|811ea9ca2ab8061aef7359c396ed9139aa	why yes, its your fault. why lead him on? no point, really. just tell him to stop, because you need your space. tell him how you really feel instead of flirting back.|`|Rodj52Swaa	well you should avoid him and if he does anything to your pretty little self you should get your friends to whoop his @$$|`|iByp9i2Naa	Walk up and knee him in the crotch.  Should work perfectly unless he likes that sort of thing!|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Can you talk to his friend and ask his friend to pass on your feelings?<br>  Can you just tell him over the phone next time he calls?<br>  If these easy way outs do not work, talk to some one (cops,whoever) who can set his butt down and make damn sure he knows this has got to stop and what the consequences will be if he does not.<br>  PS If he sends you any gifts make sure you do not accept any of them. Good Luck Hun|`|vPD4s1pMaa	poor you. take this a professional. don't leave your situation in the hands of people like us! we are bored people that either don't have jobs or are skipping school! (at this time)|`|AA11758925	Your 15, This sounds like a crazy boy who isn't in love but lust. Leave em, learn and get a education. All the parties and men etc. will come back around-they will always be there. Just step up to the plate-invent something- tell em your parents are not alowwing you to date anyone and if they find out your in the dog house. that might help him from calling so much :)|`|836vtf9Saa	let him down gently|`|yKLBdoigaa	Get out now. It's like a hole that he is digging and your in the hole with him. You still have time to grab the edges and climb out before you're in too deep. You can get better than this.|`|d2FJBJ8baa	why would you lead him on if you don't want anything??<br>  <br>  STOP LEADING HIM ON|`|AA11564046	hahha u lost me at 37 missed calls,<br>  crepper 101|`|1R4x0CRdaa	he wants to take u all the way|`|y2nC8BUGaa	You have to tell him he's going way too fast.  If you don't things will get way out of hand and you'll end up hurting him worse than just telling him this now.  If you need to do it in a text or something go ahead, just do it.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Call your cell company, and have that number blocked. Don;t go double dating with him. Don't go anywhere with him. He sounds dangerous. If he follows you places, call the police, tell the school.|`|MQ1QVNXbaa	I had a boyfriend like this and trust me IT GETS WORSE. Wait till he gets a car. He might come to your house (Like my ex) and lurk around.<br>  <br>  Get away from him fast!<br>  Trust me you want nothing to do with him|`|ul2zaaPNaa	Drive to mexico----oh wait yer 15? Drive to mexico in a golf cart.|`|mCQx7Co5aa	im 16 and my boyfriend told me he loved me the minute he asked me to go out with him, it didnt freak me out, but for you! i think you have to tell him, dont be affraid, tell someone, like an older sibling  so someone knows about the whole thing, if you just keep flirting back and then tell him to stay away from you, it's going to drive him crazy, stop flirting back and tell him that you want him to stop flirting with you as you dont have much feelings for him<br>  goodluck|`|3USNsjlTaa	Well first, get a knife. Second tell him straight up what's going on. Third, judge whether or not you need to use the knife.|`|9maQMHXFaa	only 15 hes probaly just infatuated with you|`|qoxAmc9Xaa	tell him the truth and then when you go back to school watch out for him and if you see him you turn the other direction and if that dont stop then the next time he calls have your dad answer the phone and tell him that you are no longer allowed to date or something. or you could just start talking to someone else in front of him. if none of those work i am sorry.|`|yUgGedQpaa	u r just gonna have to tell him how you feel...that is pretty much your only option....unless you want the stalking to continue|`|KuVQF4fMaa	You are still at a young age so i think that you should talk to him gently. by saying," It's really nice that you care for me a lot and i understand that but don't be too much like that. i like the real "you" better,"     and if he judges that then compromise with him to see if anything will change.|`|iatrGyHoaa	well the point of dating is to eventually get married. and what hes doing shouldn't be tolerated.. tell him to back off a bit, and your not even dating.but he doesn't seem to know that. as hard as it may be just tell him how you feel about him, good or bad. just say it, you will feel much better afterwards.|`|sdprDmbUaa	Puke on his shoes,,,NOW !|`|ik5jPtraaa	hmmm..... u can tell he's obviously stalking u! if you dont want to face him then u should tell him that u are not ready for a relationship through text or fone calls .... but in another case if u have a little something for him (since you mentioned quite alot of good points about him) u should talk to him and tell him to slow down.....<br>  <br>  hehe hope it helps!|`|PGv2DMiZaa	look dont be scared if you like really like him just tell him i dont want to make this go really fast but say it in a nice way like time goes fast and dont you go along just keep our relationship at step 1 <br>  <br>  don worry it is really strange to tell someone this when you you in *****<br>  <br>  bye<br>  hope it works|`|EawixQx4aa	You have to sit him down and talk to him face to face. tell him that this is going way to fast and you want to slow down. you also can not lead him on anymore in anyway, you must be straightforward. If you lead him on or flirt back he will get the wrong impression.|`|xIq0M27zaa	Talk to him & tell him how you feel. It sounds like your something special to him so instead of ignoring him and possibly breaking his heart tell him that things aren't that serious & you want to get to know him first. Trust me seeing a boy cry is NOT a pretty  sight! <br>  (Email me the results {if you take my advice} @Mellisapenya@yahoo.com) <br>  Good Luck!|`|TWV0DT9kaa	you should def put out straight away. have a few kids and move to the suburbs. ahh young love|`|MTSg2dkDaa	Firstly, you need to end this. Full stop. Tell him face to face - or via text if you prefer - that this behaviour is driving you away. Tell him that if he doesn't back off and act civilised, the "relationship" will end. If he takes no notice - get a restraining order.|`|AA12040366	you really need to ignore your feelings about him. it is hard but you must try. when he texts you respond by telling him that it isnt working out. compliment him on his good aspects but be blunt when you tell him that it is over. if he does not get the hint have your parents change your number and tell your friends to keep it secret. if your friends dont know what he is doing-fill them in maybe they can do the texting for you.  choose someone that you feel that you are strongest with and have them stand behind a door at home or around the corner and invite him over to talk . with the friend nearby but out of sight maybe you can get the courage to stand up to him more and they can step in if he doesnt listen. worst case scenario let your parents know they can talk to him or his parents or go to the cops and report it. it works as a guy i have issues with women the same way.|`|E4BCJkWYaa	omg i know this situation all too well. the quicker you get rid of him the easier it will be. so you  know how when a baby is old enough to stop using a bottle, so you have to ween them onto a big kid cup ? ween yourself from him. text him back less and less, NO MORE FLIRTING, use short words like.."okay " "sure", but don't seem like your angry. at the movies, corss your arms across your chest and DONT kiss him. he'll get bored of you if you become uninteresting.|`|WsNLjEByaa	Pesonnaly if its becoming physical like hitting or even sex i say you should break up with him if hes just an annoyance talk to him if he shows to be threatened when you mention slowing down or breaking up i would get help because he could be a danger. Good Luck!|`|zIma8YWYaa	Get out asap!!! I could get worse. Really worse. You don't wanna know. So tell him you just wanna be friends or if he could tone it down a little. Break it to him easy. It'll work hun.|`|EqmklxLqaa	Either be with him or don’t be with him.  If you tell him to back off and he doesn’t, that’s stalking.<br>  It’s your move.  More than half the marriages end in divorce.  How many of those that stay together are dysfunctional, miserable?  Is it a win situation?  Depends on who gets the money.  Be free... be happy... hang on to your assets.|`|GQbH0whQaa	It'll never get better if you keep sitting around. You need to go to him IN PERSON and say it clearly. It doesn't have to be insulting, just make sure your serious or he'll just think you're joking. Be like- Listen, your a cool guy and cute and everything but i kind of want to slow down okay? I'm not ready to do all this so fast, so i would really appreciate if you could help me out. Something to that effect, in your own words, whatever you wanna say. You're going to have to face him, but when you do you'll feel sooo much better. then you can just hang out with your friends and try to keep your mind off him. Also what's the L word? ha|`|O5KOwhovaa	Tell a teacher and your parents.<br>  <br>  Do not respond to any messages or telephone calls he makes.|`|hW9Kv59Iaa	Ignore.|`|YtDp0wjdaa	change your phone number.  your cell company will change it if you tell them whats happening.  then avoid him at school.|`|BnPe68lmaa	Wuts the L word? and talk to him and say u want to be just friends with him and if he dosn't u will ignore him ok<br>  <br>  plz answer mine|`|ntfOcTnWaa	Um, wow, what a freak.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just tell him if he wants to continue seeing you, to just chill out.
giHHZiL7aa	be like.. theres fun in everything when im involved ;)<br>  ahaha|`|gCptw4gMaa	Try 1 of these: <br>  what r u trying to say? lol<br>  where's the fun in u? lol|`|wcDy86xuaa	Like has 1 "e"|`|w5ZJqatXaa	just tell him theres alot of fun in the sport and maybe he should try it and you guys can play together.|`|aehDH3Maaa	boy that sees no fun in sport = GAY|`|xqan4ChSaa	i dont get it at all|`|PGv2DMiZaa	tell him that ther must be somthing you like|`|w3T7veX8aa	u can say **** up
R5ILa4Imaa	Maybe you are just growing up and ready to leave all the silly bitching about other girls and girly talk about boys behind. You should be OK soon and will find new friends at collage. Good luck|`|32lv9NmKaa	your growing up.. seems to me your more focused on school and not so much in boys and messing around. there is nothing wrong with you..|`|gKZQXYzWaa	i think u have found yourself <br>  im just the same i dont go out and i prefere being inderpentant <br>  i just put it down to finding yourself|`|OBklo7D6aa	hormones|`|5NhartQ3aa	I am so sorry that you are going through this.  It's totally normal too......I think every girl feels that was at some point or another.  Don't let other people stop you from doing what you want to do.  I felt the same way at your age and the best thing I did, was go to college! most of the time, the people that you know in High School start to disappear when everyone goes off to different colleges and universities, you're lucky if you have one or two friends that stick from high school.  Life begins in college and there are so many people to meet and so many things to do, you will really learn alot about yourself and the type of people that you would want to associate with.  Just go and see what happens and I can guarantee that you will have the best time!!!!  Good luck to you and your future ahead!|`|asAWGIgnaa	i dont know why your acting like this, but i wouldnt worry. maybe the people who were your freinds, you didnt really like them and so arent freinds with them now. at first i was nervous about college, but everyone is in the same position about not knowing anyone, you will make friends in colloge, trust me, there are so many different people ther, even if it takes time you will. one of my mates had no freinds in her classes untill the 2nd term, now she has loasda mates. you just have to work your way through this, find out what you want ect..|`|8b777bb7241207abbd23a09b05127a4caa	i don't know.<br>  i act the same way as well.<br>  i have friends but it's like i feel better on my own. i'm less jumpy, and i'm more comfortable. i get told i'm depressed all of the time, but i'm perfectly happy.<br>  don't worry.
nKSmgjylaa	Music is always a hit with my mates. :)<br>  Call some other friends and if they can't sleep over have them over for a few hours before bed. Play a truth game where you have to admit what guys you fancy that you know, but you're sworn to secracy and nothing said leaves the room! Haha, me and my friends do that very time we sleep over. Try kareoke, I love that. Watch a movie, eat popcorn, talk guys, do each others hair and makeup, there's loads you can do.

m81dfyOYaa	Yes it does make me shut down and I don't like it. Another one I don't like is when I'm telling my husband about something that happened and he'll say, well you should have said ...|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I agree with you. People have a right to their feelings, even though their feelings are a result of perception, it's still their feelings. It's inconsiderate to say' you shouldn't feel that way' or 'you should feel this way'. In a nutshell, it's called 'altercasting' and it' s a form of manipulation that goes against a persons right to freedom of choice.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	well, you shouldn't feel that way.<br>  the society sometimes dictates what we should feel and we shouldn't feel.<br>  so again, you shouldn't feel that way.<br>  <br>  jk.<br>  <br>  lol.|`|gfHutvEFaa	I absolutely agree.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	There are two wrongs in this situation. First is the "should" statement. Just because someone feels that something should be a certain way does not mean it HAS to be that way. They need to learn to be more accepting of the reality of life. The second wrong is you insisting on feeling a certain way. You do not HAVE to feel a certain way; it is your choice. Granted people can say and do things to influence the way you feel, but when it really comes down to it, you have the option to make a choice to feel differently than you normally might in certain situations. Learning to exercise this ability is a powerful step in taking control over your life to make it more enjoyable. It's up to you.|`|8a8e5dcc284740df009d2405e628cc0faa	While there is some truth to what you said you will admit that there is a middle line as to emotions in general. emotions are personal yet many people drown in a glass of water or are overly emotional for things that are insignificant and others have no emotions to things that would raise ones hairs up.<br>  There is however something called psychology that tells you how to manage and deal with your emotions.<br>  If you thing everybody at the office is against you because they whisper when you are around (or so you think) and you get upset and angered and emotional about it when you tell your husband ... that is not emotion that is being paranoid.<br>  There are many examples like that. So you see emotions are good and part of you ... but emotion are valid only when they are confronted with reality and truth. Anything else triggered by your mind or your interpretation of things is not an emotion it is an illness.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	yeah my husband has said that before. I don't think he was trying to dictate how I should feel, he was just saying (in a weird way) that he wasn't trying to make me feel that way. That I took it wrong. That the way I was feeling he didn't intend.<br>  Everyone has a right to feel how they feel no matter what.|`|79wOWoM0aa	I see what you mean, but if I feel that your question is racist or something stupid, wouldn't you tell me I am wrong to feel that way?<br>  <br>  If someone's reaction is grossly out of proportion to a situation then I think it's fine to tell someone their brains are out of whack.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	Yes, my husband doesn't understand how i can be depressed and need medication for it despite not coping with my dad's death a long time ago, and us having many problems over the last year. it's not a helpful attitude.|`|AFQmwv54aa	You bet it does. And another one is you  don't know how I fell. That one drives me nuts.|`|uwxezFHjaa	yes my husband says that all the time and it drives me CRAZY|`|i15KoiJhaa	My Hubby used to say that to me... but since we had this discussion SEVERAL times LOL he has since changed it to "Well, I'm sorry you feel that way"<br>  <br>  ^5 To my Husband!|`|d29acb440da58208c80cddd2837899e5aa	Well, I don't think that a spouse is trying to mislead you. But possible may not know or understand your view totally. That is where your communication is needed. You should be able to listen to each other views and empathize on how he/she feels. I don't think that a spouse is really trying to dictate your feelings but needs to know where you stand on a situation. If it is a mother in law or a relative, then I would say put them in their place and keep them out your business, but you are grown sugar, so you can feel what ever your heart desires. God gives us those emotions to deal with and allows us to react the way we are. So noone can take that away from you.|`|3wl27GF1aa	You are right. Our feelings are one of the few things that we cannot control. If you feel a certain way. That's that.|`|wqchA8B7aa	No, but I tell my spouse that.

I am upset..I'm angry...and he will tell me... No your not!!<br>  <br>  Yeah.. I hate that.

Only do nice things for people that appreciate you and what you are doing for them. Don't just give away your time to just everybody. They have to earn you generosity. Period.

My cousin who will be our coordinator on the day of the wedding will be putting the centerpieces together on the day of the wedding and she's charging us $200 for working on the day of the wedding.<br>  <br>  Our DJ is a professional dj that has done work in nyc radio stations and because he's my mother's neighbor he's only charging us $800 dollars which is an amazing price. <br>  <br>  Our photographer is also a professional that has been doing work for 30 years and i got him at an amazing price of $1500 and he's giving us a great package.<br>  <br>  The hall is a hall which i have to rent everything my self. The hall only includes tables and chairs. After renting everything china, glassware, table linens, chair covers, waiters, bartender, alcohol and everything else it will be about $10,000. This price is alot less than what it would be because i have an aunt who owns her catering company and she's doing our food for our wedding at a great price. She's giving us apps for a cocktail our and a complete sit down dinner. My budget is $20,000- $22,000 and because of the diy projects and the help that my aunt owns her catering company we will be able to stay in budget.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Florist: $150 (but we are doing non-floral centerpieces).  So it's just my bouquet, my 2 bridesmaids bouquets and 3 boutonnieres.<br>  DJ: nothing, we are hooking up a laptop to the system and saving the money. BUT the DJ's around me are going for $500 - $1200 per night. Depends on what you want and who they are.<br>  Location: $475 for the location and then $12 per person for food. Drinks are charged on Tab (we only pay for what they drink).  Open bars generally run about $25 - $40 per person.<br>  Photographers: for a good one around me you're looking at $1500 - $3000. Anything less is cheap and crappy.  However, I got my cousin doing mine so it's free.  <br>  (yes I'm pretty lucky with that. lol)<br>  Check out www.theknot.com  They have a great budgeting tool.

I spent 600 on my dress, 1000 on my DJ, 1600 on my photographer (not including prints), 300 on my cake, 2000 on food, 600 on open bar, no champagne toast.

hUHwf0hmaa	If I were you, I would only tell him if you truly plan to be abstinent until you are married.  If you blow it and have sex of any kind with him, you could be endangering his entire future, depending on the age of consent in your state (statutory rape laws).<br>  <br>  I heard a story about a man who was incarcerated for a couple of years and now must register as a sex offender because he had sex with an underage girl.  She was 17 and he was 18, and they are now married with a couple of children, but he still has to register everywhere they go, he has a very hard time getting hired if he needs a job, and they are looked at like criminals and perverts as soon as their neighbors find out he is a "sex offender."  It has ruined both of their lives, and the lives of their children, because they're poor as dirt due to his being unable to overcome his felony conviction record for "rape."<br>  <br>  So please, be careful.|`|xrsAGqb7aa	just tell him!|`|OgkGsCkvaa	Just be like.... hey dude, ill show you mine if you show me yours.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Don't tell him!

AZ6Z0pXJaa	It's a 'chick' thing - you know, best friend gets engaged, they get all the trimmings and they look around and think "hey - I want that too"!<br>  <br>  Seinfield once said (remember THAT show?), that people in their mid to late 20's, just BECOME engaged - doesn't really matter if they love the person or not, but once 2 or 3 or 4 of their friends become married - they simply look at the person they've been dating for a while and get married to that person, irrelevant of whether they are compatible or otherwise.<br>  <br>  On a more serious note, it probably has something to do with our biological clocks and the male needing to "propagate the species" - by the way, I don't feel that being married is all that important - to me it was simply a ceremony.|`|SmFVG8eXaa	I think ultimately thats the purpose of dating. If you have no interest in spending forever with a person, why waste time with them?|`|TOSeJQJnaa	Women desire commitment through marriage because it is within the very fiber of our nature to care for a husband and children and to be loved and protected in return.  It isn't a fixation or an obsession, it is the way we were designed.  Men and women were created to be together and compliment each other, but we have fallen into disharmony with the laws of nature and therefore, have little to no understanding of what real love and commitment is. I have included a couple of links which explain the nature of the relationship between men and women which you can view if you are interested.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you in finding the answers that you need.|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	So we want to be committed more than being used as sex material.|`|AA11315360	Because most women want to get married. It is normal to want a wedding and to believe that that man only wants to be with them for the rest of their life. And by getting married a man is showing his family and hers that he is going to be there for her forever. He is announcing his love for just her and no other.<br>  Also to have kids it is trashy not to get married before having kids.<br>  <br>  There are very legal rights if a couple is not married. Such as if the man dies his benefits would not go to his GF, because she was only a GF. Also many insurance companies DO NOT cover pregnancy unless you are on a family plan. And to be on a family plan with an insurance company you have to be MARRIED.<br>  <br>  It makes legal matters and insurance matters less complicated if 2 people are married.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	So many assumptions, so little time...|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	you're the one obsessed with NOT getting married so you wonder why women want to get married. I bet you're a commitment phobe. women just want to be loved. Instead of being the fish that a guy throws back into the water, she wants to be kept. Sometimes we just need reassurance. Guys that think women want to trap them into marriage or who think women just want to get married are freaked out of commitment, I think. All of this stuff is underlined by all of our fears. A women's fear to NOT get married and a man's fear to commit forever to one woman. Some women don't have this problem and some men don't have it either. It all depends. Women want marriage because it is traditional and they want the fairytale that includes a prince who wants to shower her with true love. Does it exist? Hmmmmmmm|`|OntO6wE4aa	change your pool. There are women who think like you.|`|JDUhhAQyaa	As a beautiful women I have said no to marriage many times and do like<br>  going out to dinners and a dance.<br>  The trouble is men want the benefits of bedding a women and running off to see other or more, till their run is over ,then they want a good wife to settle down with in the end.<br>  As for me it's I have trouble making it known I just want to be friends <br>  with no sex.So why do men date a women and expect to sleep with them when all we want is a nice date with no strings like sex and marriage as a nurse I have my own money house and everything I want <br>  but it seems like a man can't date a women for a good conversation and a nice good time with out sex on their mind or looking at the nice house and money they have.But I'm happily married now to a man that waited and has works for The Catholic School Board and had his own farm when I met him.To answer your question don't pick easy women to sleep with and then you wouldn't have any problems.|`|ppF6oSCQaa	Getting engaged and married is pretty normal..if it weren't hallmark and the flower industry would be broke.  Look, most people who are truly in love, do want to get married.  So, if you're not in love, perhaps you should tell your girlfriend this directly.  If you don't have a girlfriend, you should tell the one you're dating right from the beginning that you don't intend on getting married or engaged.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	Honestly I don't understand that either. When my husband and I started dating I had every intention that he'd just be a summer fling..I didn't want anything serious. That made it easier for us to just have fun and get to know each other...and lo and behold but we've been together almost 12 yrs now. I firmly believe it's b/c he didn't feel any pressure to do more than what he wanted. I think too many women try to put the cart before the horse and so they quite often just end up miserable and blame it on the guy for "being afraid of commitment".|`|Dg5qbQtJaa	Cuz that's what dating is for.

Most people like the idea that someone is willing to commit to them forever. So when you begin dating someone of course there is a hope that they will be someone you can share that with.

I am not saying all women think this it's just my perception. I wanted to get married but i got hurt in the end and am now divorced. Long term relationships can continue without marriage in my eyes. two ppl cam be committed without being engaged or getting married. But as i said thats my opinoin|`|2gTgw9o9aa	its because they dont want to waste there time with something thats not gonna have any meaning later on in life.|`|1pK1Sd0Gaa	They are not obsessed by that and they do some thing else to think about.

But i have commitment issues of my own.  So that could be why.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I think it's a holdover from the 20th century.  In the past women had to get married in order to have any kind of life, remember we were second class citizens at one time who couldn't vote or own property.  This mentality has been passed from mother to daughter for centuries.  You can't expect it to just stop in a short 70 years.|`|wqchA8B7aa	Because that's the purpose. Are you afraid of commitment or something? Or just looking for someone to be your masturbation toy?<br>  Show some respect.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	I wouldn't generalize all women that way, but I can see your point... especially with the responses you're getting.<br>  <br>  I too understand the concept of simply having fun, and it's not about a masturbation toy, it's about what you want out of relationships. Some men simply want someone they can hang with and then send home without worrying about the drama of being in a committed relationship.<br>  <br>  I'll tell you for a fact, if you've ever been through a divorce and got cleaned out because you were the man, it'll change your ENTIRE perspective on marriage and how jacked up the system can be for a man. I went through a custody case and by all means, I'd rather go to prison than go through that again.<br>  <br>  Fact is, some people are too busy looking down their noses at those who wish to remain single and date rather than be married, as if there is something wrong with that lifestyle. Stop sitting here judging the man and telling him to show respect, when in fact it's YOU that's being closed minded and disrespectful.|`|l43NSgHyaa	Well, once a women reaches a certain age, dating is about finding a life partner and not about messing around.  So, women are looking for valid relationships that are actually going to grow and mature into marriage.  It's not like we're obsessed, but we know what we want.  We want to find a life partner and someone to settle down with.  So, yes....our intentions going into a relationship is that this person will end up being "the one"<br>  <br>  If this person is not "the one" then the man needs to make the women clear of that.   Don't waste a women's time, if you feel like you could never marry her.    <br>  <br>  If a women has been in a relationship for a long time and her boyfriend hasn't committed, she has a right to press for an answer.   She has a right to ask, "Are you going to marry me or not?"<br>  <br>  It's not that she's obsessed, she just wants an honest answer.  No women wants to waste her time, beauty and youth on a man that doesn't want to marry her.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Yes, long-term relationship without committment are a waste.   Yes, marriage does show committment.  Not getting married,  just shows you're too chicken to commit.    Try to justify it all you want.    But, if a man really loves his girlfriend, he'll marry her and make it official!     Any man that says otherwise, is running scared.|`|kIblsxJQaa	men do this also.  Every man I have dated has asked me. Its nuts.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	I hate it when girls want to be all serious<br>  <br>  what's wrong with having fun?|`|7b6177ffccd38a7fe7428a728f8a79c1aa	As men, we have played a contributing role in this by creating a disparity between the pay men and women receive for doing the same work.<br>  <br>  As women, they have played a contributing role in this by preferring to have sex with men who are better off financially, thus encouraging men to engage in pay discrimination (so that men can enjoy sex more often).<br>  <br>  Cham hits the nail on the head.  Marriage is one solution to maintain societal order, so that people aren't killing each other over love triangles left and right, and so that children can be brought up in stable family structures.  Unfortunately, given that marriage only lasts about 50% of the time (and 25% of those aren't happy ones), there has to be a better solution.  Being married does not guarantee happiness, and there are certainly relationships which have plenty of happiness without requiring marriage first.<br>  <br>  Given that marriage has yet to magically transform irresponsible people into responsible ones, and that people aren't naturally monogamous anyway, I think we should just bury the concept altogether, and move on.|`|AA11705300	Because you only have so much time in life to 'screw around' and frankly, my dear, there are more men running around when they are 53 thinking they are still 22 than there are women feeling that way.<br>    I advise you to always seek the 20 year old or at most, the 23 year old for your adventures. They will stick with you for a year or two and then get distracted. Then you move on to the next one.<br>    Oh, yeah, only marriage shows commitment. When you've been with someone for 40 years and you never bothered to get married, the only question anyone has is: why couldn't you bother? Had to have the illegitimate children on your way to your 40th anniversary? Couldn't look into the benefits of marriage? Wanted the freedom to take a 4 year separation break from each other? Even though you never did? Pretended you were rebellious adolescents for 40 years?<br>    I guarantee you - the reason the starlets stay with the guys they refuse to marry (Susan Sarandon, Goldie Hawn, Angelina Jolie, for example) isn't because they are such free spirits. It's because they trust their financial advisors and their lawyers to protect their interests - all the way to the grave!|`|vyNlyfczaa	some are romantic, some are crazy but at least we have more on our minds than sex:D <br>  we like to know that relationship what we are in is going somewhere so we don't waste the time:D|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	It's part of our nature.

If she did it before what makes you think she won't do it again.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	So, basically what your ex did to you, you are about to do to your girlfriend?   I would think twice about this girl.  Do you really want to set yourself up for heartache again?|`|rAeJ74Neaa	i feel it may be where from when she broke up with you was maybe because she had feelings for some other guy, but felt harsh to break ur heart. But perhaps she still has feelings for you so she wouldnt want you to really be with any one else so she wants to keep these feelings from you for her. As she may get jelous if she noes you have another gf. She may feel she wants to get back with you but there may be some one else for her thats holding her back and shes confused who to be with , but at the same time she shudnt lead you on. From what i have read it looks like she wants you to keep the feelings for her and everything but on the other hand she may just generally want you back .|`|sr0vZPQqaa	What's her game? she dumped you and she's now playing with you.

I think for both of you it is highly unfair for you both to have another partner and be messing around with your exes.  Either ditch your gf and get back with your ex or tell her to take a hike.<br>  <br>  If she really wanted you and vice versa you would have ditched your current partner and be asking her to come back to you.  It sounds very much like you both want your cake and eat it.<br>  <br>  And if she says she 'can't have other relationships' cos of you, then how come she has someone else?<br>  <br>  The pair of you need to stop being dishonest and selfish and let the partners in your life free to find someone who DOES 'give a f**k' date them for a change.

He should be proud to have you, not keeping you hidden.<br>  <br>  Other then that, I suppose you shouldn't feel bad.

Love happens over time, and it's so incredibly strong and means so much. I think lust is also a part of love. It's the part of love that keeps you sexually attracted and gives you the sex drive- mainly lust.<br>  <br>  I agree with your penultimate paragraph.

My man and I are emotionally connected and that in turn drives the lust up.  We can't keep our hands off each other, but we connect on every other level: emotionally, spiritually, and soulfully.  We laugh, talk about everything, and when he touches me....oh Lord, the enormous feelings I have for him take my breath away and I just want to throw him down and make him see stars (which has happened, LOL).

FNJCHQalaa	Yes. Love and lust are VERY different things. Love is a willingness to stay committed to someone regardlessof the current or future circumstances. Lust is a blind passion for something/someone with no thought for how they/it might feel. I can see how you might get confused in this day and age, due to the complete misuse of the word love(I love this candy, I love this song, etc.), but the two are very different.<br>  <br>  "Love doesn't 'beat' lust. Lust, and sex, are a PART of love"<br>   <br>   In reference to the quote above-<br>  I can't believe society has sunk this freaking low. Lust is one of the seven freakin' deadly sins!

bb06GQ5Paa	I'd say 28.   Get another haircut, one that makes you look a little more youthful.|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	28.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	You certainly do not look 40. Maybe mid-20's, late 20's at oldest. It's a really good picture of you! :)|`|g5RS83paaa	you are so handsome and probably look older because you don't have a babyface. I would guess 26 or 27|`|4fC6EJWfaa	30, shave and get a new haircut.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	you don't look 40 at all, i would say more like 28 but that might depend on what you're wearing, etc.|`|tmckNa4baa	I'd say around the 30's no way 40!|`|kERP7zAhaa	i'd say 35 max|`|3tnVVFjHaa	you look like you will about 22 in march.|`|71VRvldJaa	About 25-28.  I think the pose, the setting and reading the newspaper make you look older.  You look your age in the picture with the girl|`|gYuJUyvvaa	20-30|`|iTItI0VXaa	Bigger question is how old do you feel?  I feel younger than I am and I act younger.  It all depends on how old do you feel!|`|hL57d1MNaa	From that view, you're pretty cute.|`|QE2GKQWkaa	i say 35 max too|`|vMKEg29kaa	First off why you so concerned about the age? Its how you feel more than you look. Besides, its true i wont ever believe that you'd turn out to be 22 ever ... if you go for my personal age anticipation in regards to your pic .. I'd give you 30 maximum.<br>  <br>  Cheer up ... u look cool ... again, age means nothingness at least to me.|`|gCptw4gMaa	I'd say 25-30, ain't no way you look 40!|`|zRUEKKH5aa	21|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Don't  know but i think i fancy you lol|`|QS3PtXg8aa	u dnt look 40 no way!! bwt 27 or sumthin max|`|cJooDZpnaa	It's hard to say from a side view but you do look in you're 30's maybe you spend to much time in the sun|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	I would say 25 max.|`|roQIRcZVaa	No way, not 40.<br>  Yes, you look about 21.<br>  <br>  that picture just makes you look older because of the angle <3|`|LmFGYK7laa	u look ..... um .... about 31 ??? 33 max ...|`|lY2jWW9xaa	I would guess you are in your late 30's judging from the profile.|`|Rodj52Swaa	around 22|`|f3a69d4445ff73558288c867d72cb3f8aa	maybe late 20s...<br>  mmmm.. you look like a celebrity... are you by any chance? :PP|`|xqan4ChSaa	2 tell u the truth yes im not trying 2 be mean|`|AA12218857	I would say 25-30|`|8vfCRg7Caa	judging by your avatar you look like you 16.|`|PVfymAdgaa	yeah 35 max.|`|b3586153c230af1842263c5f9b44fa97aa	In the starbucks photo you could pass for a handsome 40. I looked at the other photos and I think its the hair cut. Also the dark facial hair<br>  growth pattern. Keep clean neat facial shave and a hair cut and you'll drop 10 or 15 yrs of your look. Nice physic. Some women prefer<br>  a mature look to go with a great body.|`|4df83be0019a0ea6fe9f976e4fa7915aaa	33, I'd say.|`|HOVvKqxsaa	34|`|5kl3yGRnaa	no older than 30|`|jXndHFm3aa	25-28|`|2n3MTJgraa	i say early thirty's|`|46fouwFfaa	I think that a picture that shows your whole face would be better. You look like you're in your early 30s. Maybe an unhealthy lifestyle is what is making you look older.|`|nukqnS6Eaa	Lol i would be 22 in october and i always get that "you look older" crap. but you do look like your in your 30s which is not necessarily a bad thing,just means you got a mature look about you|`|7586a5fb518ea697aa3522e5672f338daa	i'd say you look around your early 30s. <br>  tips:<br>  -straighter hair<br>  -get skinny jeans(not tight ones)<br>  -nike/converse/vans<br>  -no beard/mustache(shave)|`|6gdEKcehaa	26 or 27ish<br>  <br>  however old u are u look good|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Whoever told you that is a BAD judge of age!!!!! You look like your in your twenties. My guess is between the age of 25 and 30. You don't look bad at all. Don't get wrapped up into that opinion.|`|a0Pa51z1aa	I'd say early thirties.  Maybe get a more youthful haircut, you've kind of got a dad one going on.|`|PwQLpawkaa	i think you are hot!! <br>  and you dont look 40, u just have that handsome cheek bone look going on!!!lol|`|ee5MawLdaa	its a bad pic. ur at n angle.

xXyy51Efaa	Tell Matt to not tell Kate, because she will be really mad with you if she finds out. <br>  <br>  But to me, I think that Matt is just a waste of time. I mean seriously, he called you a f***** animal??? I think that he is just a waste. But that's my opinion.
G2QNC22eaa	sounds like hes feeling really secure in the relationship hes having with you so hes not that at all bothered what he looks like anymore ....<br>  its the saying when some people say when there in love they let them selves go they don't care because there so in love only you matters to them ....<br>  <br>  i would just tell him you like him better the way he used to be tell him how you really feel about him being the way he is now tell him your not happy and you want the old person back you were attracted to him more than a shaggy haired man make a joke of it too to make it not so tense <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped :) <br>  <br>  <br>  please go on mine and answer some of my questions please :)<br>  <br>  <br>  thank you for the last comment on my asked question really helped me a lot im still in the middle confused as much <br>  thanks for the help though :)  xx|`|ZAz7SEcfaa	This is better than when a girl stops having sex with you. why? cuz this is a guy and now you think you control everything.<br>  <br>  Quotes!!<br>  <br>  "Because he's in a relationship, he's too comfortable!!"<br>  <br>  "tell him go to the gym!! screw the cut."<br>  <br>  "Okay have a serious talk with him. Even get his freinds to do something about it, do anything you can to get your man back!"<br>  <br>  "You are not shallow for wanting him to take better care of his appearance."<br>  <br>  ---------<br>  double-standard anyone???<br>  <br>  BUT the answer is the same. Have standards and stand up for yourself. it's going to be hard for him to lose weight in a snap but maybe it's the winter in him right now.|`|cd3d6652026769d6c622057ae1142194aa	It sounds like he's feeling secure in the relationship with you, which is great, but you got to let him know that even though you still love him he needs to start taking care of himself again.  If you think he's this bad now.... well if he starts a family with you then he'll get to the point where you're doing everything, including working, while everybody suffers.  Time to step in girl!  Otherwise you'll be a hurting unit soon.|`|VrJ0H6OGaa	He may just be depressed.<br>  My hubby does that sometimes.<br>  <br>  I literally drag him into the salon to get a hair cut.<br>  It usually works best to make a day of it.<br>  Get his confidence back.<br>  Take him to get a Hair cut, out to eat, you know wine and dine him a little<br>  Make him feel special and appreciated|`|rYvK1qGoaa	Well it seems that hes trying to get a new look or something,  keep asking him to shave and all. And if he doesn't do it himself, tell him that your going to end up doing it, and at the end he'll appreciate you. and you'll end your sexy man back!|`|roQIRcZVaa	hmm it seems like you just got with him because of his looks :/<br>  <br>  let him do what he wants ha|`|08ff27fe3110ddd7da36736daaf4c2dfaa	tell him go to the gym!! screw the cut.|`|giHHZiL7aa	maybe hes getting so comftorable around you that he doesnt care how he looks.. idk talk to him without being mean ..lol|`|AA12226878	He feels comfortable around you. Maybe you can start working out with him, it can be something you two can do together. That way it doesn't seem like your calling him fat. Alot of times when you tell guys to do something they tend to do the opposite. My brother would grow his hair out just because everyone told him to cut it. It wasn't pleasant. Eventually after a year or so, my dad had to pay him big money to get it cut! BOYS!|`|LJik2RjRaa	Best case scenario: he is becoming complacent and taking you and his looks for granted.<br>  <br>  Worst case scenario: he is suffering from depression and his favourite activities have are now watching tv and eating.  <br>  <br>  40 pounds in one year is not too rapid a weight gain but as you haven't specified how much activity he get into his typical day I can't comment further.|`|iwvRBeXOaa	He got comfortable. It almost always happens in every relationship. You've been with him a year, by now you should feel comfortable enough with him to communicate how you feel. So hurry up, go talk to him. You are not shallow for wanting him to take better care of his appearance.|`|581d3e6d1f6271aa31d16117d9703a38aa	Okay have a serious talk with him. Even get his freinds to do something about it, do anything you can to get your man back!|`|YtDp0wjdaa	he changed it happens.|`|EIsnATLxaa	He wants to see if you really like him for him and not his looks|`|GvBtoKsqaa	Because he's in a relationship, he's too comfortable. If he were to find himself single again he'd probably be motivated to take better care of himself.|`|RS9mkTlvaa	Haha. =DDD <br>  Just remind him every now and then about it and by the time he's really irritated by that, he'd do it himself.<br>  Or just compare him to a guy saying he's more fit than he is now and he'd get jealous and cut it so he'd get over it. xD|`|Eug52iQDaa	Could be he was tired of being labeled as a 'good looking guy'.  That alone has a lot of pressure associated with it.  Maybe he was tempted by other women and wants to be faithful to you and this is his solution.  Try talking with him instead of molding him :)|`|xqan4ChSaa	ew um well i heh im not sure about that uh i guess nope i dont know how to help you sorry|`|dQCZDAqgaa	you can't change someone unless they want to. either accept it, or move on.
fR2Geezcaa	If this is a NEW attitude of his, I hate to say it but it sounds like he is cheating. Most men when cheating try to find fault with their girlfriend and they start fights to reflect their own guilt. To put it midly, they don't feel so guilty if they are cheating on someone that is a b**ch, etc.|`|K4Fnbvjuaa	Yu need to have a serious conversation about this with him. <br>  <br>  If he still doesn't care about what you think...then you need to re-think what you are going to do about this relationship...cause this is not a good sign.|`|hUHwf0hmaa	You are not doing anything wrong.  He is an insecure boy, trying to become a controlling man.<br>  <br>  Young people who are insecure form a need to control the person they are with, so that they can be sure at all times that they are the most important person in their lives.  If you try to "change" to please him, watch for him to do the following:  he may start to tell you he dislikes your friends or family members, or that he doesn't feel comfortable around them, and if you want to spend time with people other than him, he may accuse you of loving them more than him.  The more you try to prove to him that you love him more than anything, the more isolated you will become.  He will be the center of your universe and you will be dependent on him.  Watch for him to become more jealous and possessive - he may accuse you of flirting with other guys, or not allow you to do anything without him, even go to the store or the post office for fear you'll flirt - he may disguise this by saying he is worried for your safety, etc.  If he starts doing any of these things, you will have a hard time getting away.<br>  <br>  In short, this is the beginning of a controlling, manipulative relationship, and if you're smart, you will not allow him to treat you this way.  Part of control is making you believe you're the one doing wrong - this is how he will ultimately take control of this relationship, and you.|`|QHnS31Scaa	he wants attention and or all of your attention  or you blow him off for your friends and only want to be with him when you have no other plans|`|bHcjc9Q0aa	guys are weird like that and ever relationship will go through a time like that just talk about it with him.
TIqFAXo1aa	Volunteer!  in the field of work you are schooling for.  It will look good on your resume and help you get the job when you are out of school!|`|CdYgP1pyaa	Can't you find some hobbies?  Hang out at the library or bookstore and read books?  Do something artistic or social?|`|6359LQLNaa	hang out with friends?<br>  if you have any...
ptcaSfFsaa	Personally I think it's when you take a girl home and cook her her favorite meal. Rent a romantic movie so she can cry on your shoulder or maybe a scary movie so you can hold her tight. Tell her everything she wants to hear. Tell her how beautiful she is and stare into her eyes.(note: don't say shes hot or sexy because girls don't like that) Buy her her favorite flowers. Do everything in your power to make her happy.|`|Dl9a08Rxaa	movies are good depending much on what you want though you wont have to do much talking so theres no worrying about saying the wrong thing and you can get all cuddly<br>  <br>  go ing to a restaurant is also good but you have to be able to keep the conversation going<br>  <br>  you can also try doing something more creative and fun maybe hanging out at a park or going for a walk or ice skating, roller blading, or try playing a sport<br>  <br>  chilling out at home is also good cuz you can get cuddly and watch a movie there or do whatever you want|`|HjXTkHK5aa	Something romantic and Intimate.Ive had a date on the beach only the two of us having a picnic.Very romantic.|`|g5ZkO2fKaa	SOME ONE WHO LIKES YOU!!!|`|fR2Geezcaa	Dinner and some sorta activity were the two of you are interacting, like dancing, put-putt golf, playing pool. You should try to end the evening with something romantic like a walk on the beach or if you know of some place for a carriage ride. <br>  <br>  Movies are great later on just not for the first couple of dates. I never liked the movies when first dating because it is two hours of not talking and getting to know the person.|`|8Y9timR4aa	doing something that i don't usually do but it has to be fun|`|BKr3y30maa	Take her watch Friday the 13th that way she can snuggle up on you during the scary parts.  Then bring her home and just talk about anything and everything. And then after all the talking is done, whatever happens after that is up to you......<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and bring her some pretty flowers (like tulips!).....all women love flowers.|`|ouh5eXcmaa	ITALIAN HIGH CLASS RESTAURANT. Movies are a nice place if u go alone. out to any place she likes to eat and the mall show her u like to do what she wants and ur not like every other guy who does wat they want and does not care.|`|ee5MawLdaa	Take her to dinner and a movie or something. . . most girls love that. Or if shes not the movie kind then do something you know she likes. Take a walk or go rollerblading. Ur best bet would be dinner tho lol :)|`|ze4Gt1araa	Go to a restaurant and then hit the movies or make her favorite meal at home and rent some horror movies :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!
ae0e9c023d5f99fb81b9436f0becc392aa	Baking. I had a very strange conversation about baking once haha|`|OimS5wBJaa	just go for it pick one of the girls up carry them to the bedroom drop them on the bed then just strip her clothes off and urs and then get partyin|`|PArlaKwTaa	um....why would girls think sexually when u mention the jonas brothers??<br>  <br>  i just think of annoying little disney boys|`|ASLbRwQ8aa	ur mom..|`|bS7DN85Qaa	For me, it's Joe Anderson, blonde hair, (on boys), and phone calls.
YnBqQsNdaa	I looks that this guy likes you a lot and that he sees you in his life for a long time. I think that if the card fits perfectly with how you feel for him then yes go ahead an give it to him. He will probably wouldn't expect that but I am sure that he will appreciate it and love it. Good luck and remember, follow your heart it know best and it will guide you through the best and worst of time. =)|`|f1fYwYMVaa	he sounds like a really sweet guy so if he is then its perfect he will love it|`|SfludeD5aa	You never know with guys:) But the way you describe him' he'll find it really sweet of you. So yes give it too him.|`|TWV0DT9kaa	ya it def is. but considerin wat hes been sayin it fits id say|`|x1GlXJK8aa	Mm, just be careful. It's not like YOU wrote that, it's just the card. He obviously likes you. It's not too much, just don't rush and say you're in love when all it really is is just infatuation. Take things slow. That definitely isn't too much. At least you've gone out more than once. Just show him how much you care about him just as much as he does for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck tonight(: <br>  He seems sweet, don't be shy with him.|`|m5K9U8s8aa	Aww! I don't think so at all!<br>  The fact that it says "I don't know what the future holds," gives the sense that you really are happy that you're dating him, but doesn't impose a real commitment, which is what he/you might be unsure of at this point.<br>  <br>  But I personally think it sounds perfect<br>  and whatever you get him, he will love it<br>  <br>  (not to mention he said he hopes for many more v days to come!)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|deEWD1k3aa	I think he seems just as "into you" as you seem into him.  If he's taking time to give you an early morning call just to say hi and let you know he's thinking about you, what that card says sums it all up.  He thinks about you just as much as you think about him.   If you don't think the card is sincere enough or is just too much, write something from your own heart.|`|j7P5QAt7aa	well it depends. Is he a sensitive person? if he is then yes. Most guys dont really like stuff like that, but it depends on him. It also depends on how old you guys are :\ (don't judge wat ur gonna do by that) I think you should give to him tho. Just make sure he doesnt get the wrong idea becuz he may think u wanna do "it" becuz of the "ur touch exicts me part" but i think its sweet that ur letting him know how you feel :)|`|JBTYfyleaa	given the fact that u forgot ur VDAY Card on valentines day i would say it is not that serious and a card with that sort of notion may not reflect your current feelings for him. I Am sure he would love the card but dont give him false hope if u dont feel that way.|`|snzMW46daa	yeahh it's a little over the top. find something that's still meaningful to you and to him but less deep. that's more for someone who you've been dating for longer than a month. good luck!|`|OCTvfDsxaa	No. Not if you truly feel the way the card states. It's not to much for a guy to hear. I'm sure he will find it touching and very clear.|`|CwjDROl9aa	Aw that's sweet! I like it. But it sort of sounds like a physical sort of thing. You have to consider if you guys have become physical, if not are you ready to become physical?|`|EKoRHgdgaa	I think it is a bit much since it has only been a month...I mean you really do not even know this guy!  Keep it simple.  :o)|`|ES8af3HQaa	omg that is ssooo sweet! no its not too much its also gave me a great idea !! :D thanks :) x|`|ee5MawLdaa	If thats how you feel then no. Plus he hinted on being with u for a long time so why not ??? He sounds romantic and very thoughtful/mature. Good Luck!|`|1M9KdGuYaa	You guys have a great connection. I'm a guy and I would enjoy receiving a card like that. =)|`|0QO90jVMaa	well not if u love him a lot  but ur second guessing yourself which makes me believe u don't like him that much?|`|mJ5JzuPUaa	it dependes on the guy honestly but.i dont think so if hes a sweet person and says sweet things to you most likely he want mind hearing them or in this case reading something sweet.i think its okay/safe its not like it talks about how much you love him or nothing because some guys get scared but im sure its safe.|`|fLHg08cFaa	Under normal circumstances I would say it might be a bit heavy but given that he seems very keen, I think it's appropriate.<br>  <br>  Do not be put off by the speed of feelings...some people have been engaged after dating for only a couple of months!|`|wC9ZMPyGaa	Nope! (:<br>  With all that he said, and giving you, nope. If you can buy roses, or a box of chocolate attached to your card, that will be even better. (:<br>  Happy Valentine's Day.<br>  -LolitsLexie|`|aK4KwkwIaa	Well, I love romance and think that that is the way to go. He will appreciate that you care about him  like that and he might take ur relationship to the next level. It will be better this way for sure.|`|VeW9PjoVaa	No that's not too much. Your not telling him oh let's get married and have a baby. No your saying wow thank god I met you you make me really happy. Props for you he seems like a good guy. Much luck with him. :)|`|aWriTVhLaa	Eeeps, ya, that's a little much.  That's more like something you would give a long term bf.  I think you should go for something a bit shorter, more cute, and simple.|`|laHLW1yQaa	Is that how you feel?<br>  <br>  He is into you so don't worry about scaring him.  But don't promse what you don't want to do.|`|7e6b2cb58b00a396c428dad58f96e483aa	As the card stated: 'and for now' which for now that i how you feel.

It expresses your true feelings obviously.  Plus, it's not saying "i'm going to be with you forever."  It basically sums up that you are enjoying the time you do share together right now."  I think it's sweet and appropriate.|`|1c98ba0da76082f194ab437ed318f277aa	As I was reading it, thought you were really level jumping the relationship, but the lines that say:"I don't know what the future holds", and "...and for now" made it appropriate for your situation.<br>  <br>  Go ahead and give it to him!|`|TrEYixLXaa	He seem's like and amazing guy and it looks like he really likes you.

i6p9dJOSaa	I have to say that if I were truly honest, I sometimes wonder if I made the right decision.  The thing is, I realize no one is perfect, so changing might change some things, but would still be no guarantee of perfection.  And, my husband is a wonderful man.  It's just that sometimes our differences bother me a lot.  I wish he talked more.  I would love to have an hours-long conversation with him, but he doesn't think a lot about the same things I do, so it's hard.  That "spark" is missing with us.  We really love each other though.  <br>  <br>  When I think about leaving, I think it would be awful.  I've done it before and don't want to do it again.  It would also be very difficult... I need the help he provides.  And it would really hurt him too.<br>  <br>  I don't think either of us has any plans to leave.  But things get boring between us sometimes, and I think there's only so much you can do about it... working in the limitations that we have.|`|bSiNAsHJaa	i feel the same way but yes i stay because i know it will hurt him and i have kids now so i think of  their happiness not mine. it sucks sometimes but i figure i will probably leave once the kids are older and not so dependent on the both of us to be there all the time.  i kinda got in this relationship too fast cuz i was with my first love and he hurt me really bad by getting another girl pregnant so i just got with this guy to get back at him. now its been 12 years and three kids later and i cant find a easy way out/ i love my kids but i cant say i love him. i just get by and ignore it. and it really sucks so dont get caught up if you still have time get out..|`|AA11315360	I was with the wrong man but now Im not. I actually thought he might not be the one but I ignored my feelings and was eventually proved right in the first place, that he wasnt the one. <br>  <br>  I planned on sticking it out because I thought he was such a nice guy. And I figured I was crazy to think anything else. I thought that he was a guy that any woman would want. He was loyal, cute, and so nice to me and everyone else. Sadly I found out just before our wedding that he wasnt a nice guy. It was all fake. He was controlled by his mother and turned against me when she came between us.<br>  Also I did think he was the best I could do because I had gained weight while I was with him. Because I took care of him and not myself. And he brought a lot of stress to my life.<br>  <br>  And it turned out that I could do better than him and I did. Thankfully I have nothing to do with him now.|`|L0Hz227xaa	If your not happy you should leave, but make sure this is what you want to do first.

You may be able to find it for sale by a previous owner.  If the photo is a good one, and shows detail of the back and front then it's totally possible to have it made.  Your other option is to go into a bridal salon with the picture and let them suggest something similar.<br>  <br>  Have you actually tried this dress on in the past?  If not I'd highly recommend that you go to a bridal salon and try on some very similar styles to make sure you'll look good in the dress you have your eye on.  I'd also recommend being open minded and trying on lots of other dresses while you're there, just to see if there's a style you find that you prefer yourself in.  I ended up with the complete opposite gown of what I thought I wanted, and didn't like my dress at all when they showed it to me on the hanger... but it was a whole different story once I'd got it on.

P0Fjh59Eaa	WOW! Your boyfriend's mother has some serious issues. and i can tell you it has NOTHING to do w/you as a person and everything w/her perception of her loss of control. <br>  she cannot handle that her son is a grown man. she wants to be the center of his unniverse 24/7 and to hell w/anyone that gets in her way, be it a girl friend or a child. how very sad. <br>  <br>  He needs to grow a back bone and put his mother in her place. He needs to realize that the ONLY ONE making a miserable mess of things is his mother and only his mother...that if something did happen to her it would be her own fault that she had no contact w/him. what she is doing is emotional abuse plain and simple. <br>  you need to have a serious talk with your boyfriend and tell him that under no certain terms will you allow this woman to destroy your family. that he needs to make a choice, life w/you and his daughter, or life catering to his emotionally unstable mother. <br>  <br>  she needs to be unwelcome in your home or around your child until she can behave herself, PERIOD.<br>  <br>  I would suggest to you, that you DO NOT speak to her, be around her, talk about her etc. you set the task to your husband to handle her then let him take action. if he does, back him up and support him...if he doesn't...you need to prepare yourself to cut your losses and build a more stable environment for your daughter. cause i can tell ya now, if your child grows up hearing the things your boyfriend's mother says about her...she will have MAJOR issues!<br>  <br>  and then maybe a paternaty test would shut the twat up for a while!|`|kbz5S3waaa	oh, i think we have the same mother-in-law.

His Mom, however seems to be dumping all her pain on you, since you 'took him away from her'. This is a serious grief issue on her part, she blames you or at least dumps on you. If she could only divide you and your bf, she could have her son back, and that in turn, would make her pain (grief) go away. Well, thats probably what she feels anyway. It's a transferrance and projection issue as well as unresolved grief. A trained counsellor can help, if your bf can get her to talk with someone.<br>  <br>  I wonder if your bf might have anyone in mind, a pastor for example, who might be able to offer Mom some support and counselling.<br>  <br>  She is in pain, lots of it, and she is acting out as a child would. It would really shock her if you suddenly became supportive and understanding, although, I doubt that even comes close to what you feel like doing. But that is what she needs.|`|bO2rzfISaa	It would be better to BE married than to have the perfect wedding. My wedding was at City Hall because it's all we could afford.<br>  <br>  That being said, she is totally toxic.

Getting a paternity test just reinforces her power. What a b*tch.|`|JiMG2iYjaa	Maybe she thinks like that b/c you guys had a daughter before marriage.

Your boyfriend should too.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Yes, of course, you must take the bull by the horns and insist that you will not stand for your mother-in-law's visits unless she behaves more civilly. Most likely your husband will object but you have little choice but to point the way for your husband to free himself from the motherly bond and act like an adult.<br>  <br>  Yes, this takes strength on your part. But, let me assure you that it won't take much for your mother-in-law to destroy your marriage. Check out my source for more info on "The Great Fallacies."|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Sounds like there may be some truth to what she is saying...<br>  <br>  I don't agree with the prejudice part but you did not get married, you did have a baby out of wedlock...I'm guessing you are either uneducated or still in school - state covering what the both of you can't afford...I mean it just doesn't look good.<br>  <br>  All that said, it's up to your boyfriend to put her in her place.  He's obviously not doing that so you'll have to live with the fallout...|`|goY0JHzlaa	You will not change her and it's not your place to do so no matter how wrong this situation is. This is a battle your boyfriend needs to deal with. If she feels that way about her grandchild, then, I wouldn't let my child around her. Why put the child threw all those hateful comments that spew out of her mouth? It's not the baby's fault. As long as you have given your best effort to get along with this woman, then, that's all you can do and stay away from her. Racism is a horrible thing. People become so consumed with hate that it takes over their lives. And in the end, they are the one's who truly suffer from their own behavior. Move on, keep your child away from her, and remember that you are in love with your fiance, not his mother.  Good Luck.|`|s7seaaPkaa	he needs to just stand up to her and say.<br>  that this is his family and if his mom cant except it then she cant except him as her son.<br>  thats what my husband had to say to his mom.<br>  we dont talk to her at all me and my husband only need each other.<br>  its nice to have family but if they cant get over the fact that we are going to be together.<br>  then they dont get the priviliage to be apart of my or kids life.<br>  plain and simple.|`|CjFH2Gq0aa	I know it’s hard to do, but just ignore that big *****.

Let me tell you something, ok. Hold your head up high, do not feel bad about who you are. You have opened your heart up to her son, and you are his woman, not hers. You do not need to live for her, she is like an asshole and we all have one. She is not the one that you have to please. Its not about her, it is about your relationship and your daughter. For one, she is really straight tripping and makes me question her love for her son in the first place. If she loves her son, then she should respect and loves what comes from him. Prove to him that your daughter is his, take a DNA test so that he will choose on his own what is more important to him. His daughter or her. You don't have to put up with this! DO NOT under any circumstances.If he wants to listen to her and put up with it then that is on him. But do not stress on it. Life is too short, if he feels the same as she then let him be with his mommy. What should be important is what he has with you, a beautiful daughter with a wonderful future. Let also tell you this, your baby does not, repeat, does not have to and should not have to deal with this. Life is hard on little black girls- technically she is mixed (but she is black). So his mother needs to get out of your lives. Honestly if he can not be a man and put her in her place you need to move on. I think that you deserve and your baby deserves love, and joy. It is mixed babies like her that make great people like Obama and like me.Stop worrying about that B and start thinking of your future- GOOD Luck!|`|qf0kuMCiaa	This is so sad. I am mixed and The white side acted this way. My mother mom said I will not have anything to do with those ni... kids... It still hurts me at 28 but I am happy to be both black and white.  Don't kiss your mother in law as.. Let this be his mom lost she is missing out on her grandbabys life. It takes some people sometime to let something like race ago. It was not until I was 15 yrs old until I met my grandmal and she died when I was 21 no time for me to know her at all it's sad to say but it is life. I think she will come around. Just keep being the better person and she will see what she is missing.
qPfhXZw0aa	ughhh...men. Im sorry hes confusing you sweetie. Im sure he likes you, but guys are always all over the place and dont know what they want especially when they are young! He may have told his girlfriend that he was into you before they got back together and now he knows that she would be hella jealous if she saw the two of you talking.... or he probably just doesnt want you to get in the middle of the relationship...either way hes just being respectful of his girlfriend, and thats a great quality! Im sorry hes not with you though :( That blows! But everything happens for a reason hun... just give it time and if you 2 were destined to be together it WILL happen! And if not it just wasnt meant to be. Just keep your head high and show him that your strong enough not to need him, and he will respect that about you and probably get even more attracted to you. Good luck!!! :)|`|KVFYJrDJaa	OK, I'm a guy, but I am not usually a "typical" guy, so I'll try to give you my best generic guy answer. <br>  <br>  I was with the girl of my dreams once upon a time. I screwed it up big time and she left me. At the time I was working at Hot Topic and I had a legion of groupies who used to come in and flirt with me. I found one that I really liked but I would never have cheated on my girlfriend (and never did), so we just flirted. To be honest, I dont; have it in me to act on it, but I have a low self esteem so it wen a girl flirts with me it makes me feel good about myself. Anyway, my gf left me and I continued flirting with this other girl, even almost dated her after the break up. But if my ex had called and given me even an inkling that she wanted to get back together with me, I would have dropped that chick in a second. <br>  <br>  A guy will get back together with his ex because he knows her, knows what she likes, knows what to expect, and new relationships are almost entirely filled with unknowns. Plus, make up sex is awesome. So a guy may like you, a lot, but when that ex comes knocking, it's hard to say no, especially if he's not the one who did the breaking up. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is not let him think that he has any chance with you. If you continue to show interest, he'll think that you'll be there when/if it doesn't work out with the ex. You don't want to play 2nd banana, and you shouldn't - you're better than that. Never be someone's second choice - being first does wonder for your self esteem, even if you don't have a low self esteem to begin with. <br>  <br>  I wish you all the best and I hope that this all works out for you.

(:|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	I think you guys have grown accustomed to the same thing and never came clean.<br>  <br>  So maybe it is time to come clean and find out if there is magic in the air or is it only friendship. Ask him.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|nUIe5ZdEaa	Aww. I went through something like that. It sounds like he likes you. Men are sometimes hard to understand. Its all part of growing up. He may be too scared to ask you out. Do you like him? The way you're asking "Why hasnt he asked me out yet" makes me think you like him too. And if I'm right, let him know. That will make things easier for him :)<br>  <br>  Good luck babe.
uBssj3Znaa	it sounds like he doesn't want to be with you any more ... it's kind of hard to be with someone who doesn't like you, your best bet is to move on|`|lSGNCKitaa	Even if he's your true love, doesn't mean you cannot love other guys.<br>  You may love him, but he may not love you. & you CAN find a guy who loves you back. it just takes time. Your first love isn't always the one that lasts forever, it takes a couple of trys to fall for the right one.<br>  <br>  (:|`|AA12398373	Don't mistake this guy for your true love. Your true love will love you back as much or more as you love him.<br>  If this guy doesn't love you like that then he isn't your true love, he's just a distraction from your search for your real true love.<br>  <br>  As long as you remain as courageous as you are now when you give love, then you WILL find him. Just learn to know the difference between a lover, and a distraction.|`|nCWjdyddaa	If he's not that into you any more, then I guess he isn't the love of your life. Trust me, there will be others. Just don't let this guy string you along.

P0Fjh59Eaa	So do you want to be his girl friend or his child? Your acting like a child.<br>  <br>  Your a grown woman, get your own ice cream..good lord. he's not choosing sides, he's a daddy! course his girls are old enough to get their own crap, but they are still his girls.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Can you spell JEALOUS?<br>  <br>  He does special things for his daughters because he has a life-long, loving relationship with them.<br>  <br>  If you feel like there's a double standard, talk to him about it, but remember these are his children, and children will always come first.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Are you a girlfriend or one of his kids? It sounds like they do not live with him, so would it not make sense that he would want them to be happy when they visit? When people divorce, they feel like they failed the kids, even though his kids are older, and they want to make sure the kids know they are important. <br>  <br>  I do think that he should allow you a compromise with the heat. Sit down with him and explain your discomfort. Basically, you are freezing your butt off and do not understand why that is okay with him. Do not make between you and the kids---you are supposed to be the adult. Tell him that you need him to consider your feelings and little acts of kindness go a long way. Make sure you are doing the same for him. Like, be considerate of how he must feel about his kids!|`|hO0CyOkAaa	Grow up.  You need to quit acting like a child and make a good example for his daughters by acting mature and like an adult.  If you want to act like a child and not a girlfriend then you are doing a wonderful job.|`|rx20pKgOaa	Stop spending the night and get a new boyfriend.  It doesn't sound like either of you know how to work a relationship.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Of course you must ask him. What are you afraid of? That you might get into a fight with him? But tell me, how else can you resolve this matter? Having disagreements is part and parcel of living together. How can you hope that two people, coming from two different worlds can live together without having some disagreements?<br>  <br>  But more than not being afraid of disagreements, you must also reach some sort of compromise. Isn't it possible for one of you to watch television outside the bedroom? Consider all possible solutions. Don't be afraid to suggest them. For more info check out my source and find out how to resolve disagreements in a relationship.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	Tell him how you feel.
Maepb9yraa	Me and my husband were the same as you are describing to me now. My husband works 12 hours a day is 6.5 years older than me and didn't want kids. I was 19 and he was 26 when me met. That was fourteen years ago. If he is what you want and you are not going to want anyone else, than find a way to make it work. <br>  <br>  By the way, we are still very much in love. It is being so different that has kept us together and we have two boys ages 11 and 9. So kids ended up being there anyway. I am artistic and still as vibrant and childlike as I was at 20 and he is a serious type. I love him for it and he loves me for me. If he doesn't love you for you than bail out now. <br>  <br>  The father things would bother me as well and I really don't have anything to add about that. Not being in that situation myself is hard to comprehend. Best of luck to you.|`|AA11356977	What does age have to do with any of this? If you want out get out.|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	I think you should wait rather than marry now, especially if you will be going to school.  Studies show that in some fields especially law and medicine, the divorce rate of those who marry before graduation is extremely high, and it is high as well in other fields after graduation from a college.  You will meet new people, find new interests, do new things, and reach a new level of success and you may well find someone new who you will love more because of mutual interests and desire for children.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	You are too young to be thinking of marriage right now.  Go to school, stay with him if you love him, and in 3 or 4 years if you're still together and love each other, THEN start thinking about marriage.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	I think he's gently telling you that things must happen FIRST, before you can truly be together as a couple and succeed in a long term relationship.  I suspect you're a "young" 20 and should pursue an education and more life experience - he recognizes that and I believe you should honor that as it is most respectful of him.  I ALSO think he wants more space, time to decide his future, and you have no choice BUT to give it to him - and you should, out of respect for him.<br>  <br>  Feelings aren't wrong on either side, they just are...accept that and be proactive in setting some goals for yourself in the hope he is the one and someday you truly will be together.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|AA12382198	What's going on with BOTH of you is....neither one of you is ready for marriage.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter how many years a couple are together......what matters is if they're on the same page......and I think you and your BF are in the same book....just not on the same page right now.<br>  <br>  Wait.|`|AA10684513	The age issue is nothing but him not sure if he wants kids is a major issue.  Don't marry until you are both on the same page.|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	so you were 17 and he was 24?<br>  And you are still with him?<br>  Run away and make up with your father!|`|196b73911133c4d75053bfa6ae887857aa	I don't think there is anything wrong with him, I think he just wants to be sure that it's right for you two to marry,just because two people love each other it doesn't necessarily mean that they would be right for each other to marry. He might also be thinking about that fact that you are younger and will want to party and do things that he might not be able to do anymore or he might not be into and he doesn't want to feel like he would be holding you back.
vp4xjqbLaa	If you love her you will wait until she is ready.<br>  Never force it because there is no better time then when she is 100% ready to be with you in that way.<br>  It can be hard but if she is willing to be intimate in other ways then that should fill the void you feel a little.<br>  The magic word is PATIENCE ! try not to make her feel guilty because you are not getting any! because that may either put pressure on her to take the next step when she isnt really ready to or it may make her see you differently and she will run the other way.|`|zeUcqGGjaa	you know you can still be fulfilled in a relationship and be happy except without sex and sexual thing? why dont you try making out and just kisssing for agges and ages and just being touchy with each other. by this i mean kissing, holding hands,being intimite liketuring the lights out at night and just kissing and hearing each others lips kiss and breath. thats soo hot and sexy and for me gives the intimite feeling and fullfilled without the actual need of sex. maybe iam just speaking from a female point of view?? so i dont know maybe for a male its different. lol<br>  <br>  but its also about creating tension and passion between two people. you dont need to have sex to create tension and passion between people. passion for me personally is the way the guy i love kisses me and i kiss him passionately. he can just feel my body. seriously one time we were out in the harbour, having a outdoor picnic in the marina and there was alot of people around us and we just kisssed and uno wat? we did it for 30 mins and suddenly you forget where you are and you just lose yourself in the moment and seriously at that moment just by him kissing me, i was soooo close to going off right then and there just by that!!!!!!! lol he wasnt even touching my body!!!! LOL|`|FNJCHQalaa	Dude, you're in a tough spot. Don't do anything you'll regret later! I can't stress that enough. You need to take a minute to think hard about your current relationship with this girl, and whether or not you and her are ready for sex. It might be hard to hear, but your best option could be to stay out of sex with her. Don't let anything your feeling currently sway you too much into a decision.

You and your ex had a fight and it seems that you aren't completely ready to get over that yet and the other guy is with your friend.

xQJjTuEWaa	My Husband and I do not have a Prenup.  Neither one of us got one cuz we felt that it meant you weren't planning on spending your whole lives together which is what marriage is suppose to be.  That is reason we didn't get one on other hand I can see why in this day with divorce rate so high some people would choose that.  I think it is a personal preference.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	I am a professional. I studied and worked very hard to get to where I am today. I also put my ex through school and payed for everything including at times working two full time jobs to do so.<br>  <br>  I made a ton of money and that leech (she was and still is) expected me to pay for everything forever even though at the very beginning of our relationship, I made it very clear what my expectations were only to have her tell me that because I was a man, I should pay for everything.<br>  <br>  I wound up suing for custody, I have my little girl and my career, and she can bugger off.<br>  <br>  So many times women want to make us men out to be the bad guys, but when we fulfill our part i.e. being faith full, a good parent, and hard working, loving etc., they at times think that they have put their lives on hold which is a F**KING excuse for failure if ever I have ever heard one.<br>  <br>  GET A PRENUP and if she gets offended, just ask her, why the offense if you are planning on divorcing me down the line?<br>  <br>  I will never ever put myself at risk this way again.<br>  <br>  You seem intelligent. Do some research on statistics and regardless of the biased lies that you will see here, you can quickly discern the truth for yourself.<br>  <br>  When it comes to marriage, it isn't we men that usually win out.<br>  <br>  Prenup.

I would not marry him.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Pre nups are good per se in their own right but one huge factor; majority of family courts do not recognize pre nups so they may only be as good as the paper theyre written on. So you may be upsetting your future spouse for nothing, think about it|`|p75ZEmjXaa	My wife made me sign one.  I hated the idea, I was very committed to the idea of sharing and growing together, taking a risk, and never divorcing.  My wife was less idealistic.  We got in a big fight about the whole thing and I was very offended and scared... ie. how did I get involved with someone so self-centered, etc.<br>  <br>  Finally I gave in with a compromise idea, we both listed our assets at the time of marriage and the prenup says that if we ever divorce, we each get back our original asset value.  Everything else we split per the divorce terms at the time.<br>  <br>  I had figured out on the side that we both had almost equal assets (which were significant) and so if you do the math, it's a wash and the agreement is almost irrelevant.<br>  <br>  Married over 10 years.|`|KK07gPipaa	I think a prenup is a terrible thing. When you get married you are making a promise to your partner and to God that you will stay with that person forever...so why would you need to have a prenup if you do get a divorce? If you think you might get divorced you should not be getting married. People take marriage to lightly these days.
4fc129ccfffdb16cb2d28a6fe0c55cdeaa	I'd say you should be with her, after all there is already a lot of confidence and respect if you are friends with her. however, never be too mellow with her and remember to state clearly what you like and what you don't, to stick to your own opinion and generally don't always suck up to her.<br>  She might be the type who likes strong minded guys and is just looking for a guy to protect her. <br>  <br>  Don't act like a wimp, act like a real man [it might be okay to be a little mean] and respect her in the same time! She likes you because she trusts you, so don't betray her.<br>  <br>  I give you this advice, because I like arrogant assholes myself and if I didn't have someone with whom to argue, I'm afraid I might lose interest in them.:(|`|v2D4Sao5aa	thts a really big chance well if you do love her to them give it a try but thees alot of condintion she your best friends she knows you more then any one and anybody in the whole world so take aa chance with her and see if you dont feel uncomfertable...if she says she loves you than shes not going to get bored with you ...|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	Be careful.<br>  <br>  when you say she goes with crappy guys but not you then either one of two things is true...<br>  <br>  1) She likes crappy guys and you are not her type and may soon dump you after she doesn't find you are crappy enough.<br>  <br>  2) You have delusions of grandeur and maybe in reality you are crappier than the crappy guys she sees.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, you fall under #1.

TeNIStN1aa	Some guys including myself are like that. To me, a marriage certificate is just a piece of legal document for tax purposes. Commitment is not putting your name down on a piece of document nor is it the ring on your finger. Real commitment comes from within and I don't need any documentations or rings to prove that to the world.<br>  <br>  Being divorced yourself, you should understand how difficult and how painful it is to go down that road. For guys, going through a divorce could be even harder especially if he must go through custody battles. I would be afraid to put myself into any situation that have the slightest possibility of forcing me to go through those painful process all over again. You mentioned your relationship is good and you two don't have any problems being together. If I were him, I will try not to add in new elements to this relationship because it is already running smoothly. It is a good working formula and I will try not to do anything to disturb the balance. At least not yet.<br>  <br>  You don't need to be too concerned about the situation. His willingness to have a baby with you said a lot already. You will have a place in his future and he is committed to you already. Of course, the situation could improve a little bit with legal documents. But, that's just a matter of time (or a test of time).<br>  <br>  PS: Commitments from within will out last any paper. Guys like me  take commitments very seriously.|`|jDT8yH7Raa	you have decide what things you will not give up on in your life.  if you want to get married, don't give up on that, if you want to be married before you have children, don't give up on that.  don't settle for less than what you feel you are worth.  if getting married is important to you, you need to find someone else who it is important to as well.  if you start giving up what is important to you now, will your feelings or opinions ever really count in this relationship?  Good Luck|`|xQnkYyocaa	My situation is VERY similar! I have brought up the subject a few times with him, and found out is just makes things worse. Let him decide when he is ready, don't push. I was very upset for a couple days, then it hit me, I would have to just wait. I would be much more miserable with out him than waiting to see what the future brings. Good Luck!|`|ppF6oSCQaa	He's either not into you or he wants you to stop being controlling and pushing.  You can either wait until he's ready or leave and find someone else.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Sounds to me like he had such a bad experience before he has decided not to try it again. You are paying the price of whatever issues he and his ex-wife had. Sorry!<br>  <br>  Chances are he means what he says...Don't expect him to change his mind anytime soon. When a man says he doesn't want to get married, he means it! <br>  <br>  Besides, if things are good between you two and you are living together as a family, chances are he considers himself married to you already. Why should he risk making things legal...and possibly ruining what he has already? (This is from a man's point of view...)<br>  <br>  I think you should talk to him and ask him to be honest. If marriage IS important to you, you shouldn't have to pretend it isn't. <br>  <br>  And in my personal opinion, having a child with him- without a marriage license- is not a good idea at all. Be careful here.<br>  As things are right now, nothing stops him from walking away.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|L0Hz227xaa	Girl look, do not settle. Why buy the cow if you can get the milk for free. Do not bear his kids without a marriage commitment. Make him work for it. That marriage excuse of the loser wife is an excuse to have you wait. He may never marry again. Do not give him an ultimatum but do not give him what he want s until u get what you want. Never settle. Its already a big step living with someone and not being married but kids just makes you another satistic, single mother syndrome. sO BE SMART AND JUST WAIT IT OUT, OR IF YOU GET TOO TIRED OF WAITING FIND SOMEONE ELSE. If you love him you can wait, if he loves you he will compromise.|`|hWd50Lk8aa	Becca,<br>  <br>  If that is you in the picture, I want to have an affair!!!<br>  <br>  Hey, you got to break it down for him.

Why should he risk his assets, worry about divorce proceedings, and potentially be on the hook for alimony if he doesn't have to?<br>  <br>  When you moved in with him and started sleeping with him....you really lowered your chances to be wed. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Some things just might be to good to be true. In a sense he's right, you don't have to be married to have a child, but at the end of the day, if you're good enough to live with, you're good enough to marry.<br>  <br>  Then again, some things take time ;-)|`|7UFta5tcaa	Your being played|`|IvMPh09baa	he's just not that into you.  tell him now, or never.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	You're living with him, having sex with him, and taking care of his child.

If you want him to but the cow, you're going to have to stop giving him the milk.<br>  <br>  I have answered thousands of Marriage & Divorce questions on Y!A.  Every single one that starts off, "Why won't he commit?" includes living with the guy in the details.  Every one!

Maybe you should talk to your parents first, they can offer you the best way to approach your sister.|`|EpzbqDVdaa	im sorry sweetie that's messed up. that is a unwritten rule. i don't know what you can do other than tell her how you feel and if you did that to her how would she feel. i don't know im sorry. good luck|`|LTs9nzVTaa	ok well something simmilar is happening to me but hes older ok ummmmmmmmell ur sister how weird it is and if she dsnt understand then talk to ur ex.. maybe hell unsterstand|`|LtHSMeRqaa	did she even ask if you were okay with it? You really need to just sit her down and explain how you feel about the situation.|`|BnOrf9nGaa	She likes sloppy seconds.|`|AA10873763	Unless she's evil, she's not doing it TO YOU.  She's probably doing it in spite of you.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Tell his parents. She is an adult, he is a child. They can have her arrested.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	ew. skank.<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	There's not much you can do, except to find ways to heal and cope with your pain.<br>  She's not "doing that" to you...she's doing it for her.  She doesn't care about your feelings.  Sadly, this may be a taste of what lies ahead.<br>  <br>  Very sorry for your heartache.  My sister has burned me as well (I won't trust her again and don't introduce many friends to her, definitely not men).|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	she's not doing it to you... she's doing it to herself. It's not uncommon for sisters to find the same guy, or type of guy attractive.<br>  <br>  let it go, it's not worth the heartache.|`|pYKRoKK6aa	somebody is jealous simple as that. this is not a matter of betrayal, she is not doing it just to hurt you, get over yourself and stop being so selfish|`|Z3wg4Z3daa	Ask her how your vagina tastes|`|pRF5LLloaa	he is your EX boyfriend.  You gave him up.  YOU no longer have any control over his life, and you never did have any conrrol over your sister.<br>  <br>  If he is such a good prize, why did you dump him?  Why didn't you keep him for yourself?<br>  <br>  if he is such a$$whole that you dumped him, why do you care if your sister sees him or not.  SHE is the one getting hurt, not you (and not him)<br>  <br>  this type of stuff should be filed under "Major Stupidity".<br>  <br>  Grow up.|`|XnYVzetcaa	that's a stab in the back if she hadn't spoken to you about dating him.<br>  TALK TO HER first about it and voice how it hurt you and see what she says. if she truly cares she's explain to you.<br>  <br>  now that doesn't mean she's a bad sister if she chooses to stay with him... you have to listen to her feelings about him, and judge whether you can be a good enough sister to HER to be alright with letting her be with him if her feelings are genuine.<br>  <br>  yeah it's sort of an unwritten rule to date someone your best friend dates, especially if your best friend is your sister, but what if this relationship is truly heading somewhere... i think you owe it to yourself and to her to find out the reasons for this... and she owes it to YOU to explain it.|`|AA12398373	Well I agree that your older sis is a bit selfish, and insensitive to do that. But that is your sister's issue.<br>  <br>  Your issue is how YOU are handling it, and I am afraid it's not very well.<br>  <br>  If he's truly your EX boyfriend, then get over it as quickly as you can, and move on.|`|811ea9ca2ab8061aef7359c396ed9139aa	well, maybe she liked him for awhile. probably even before you did. imagine how hurt she felt then && you dont see her all butt hurt.<br>  <br>  ...but then thats just a possibility. anyways, you guys broke up, move on. your sister && your ex arent even gonna last.|`|FdY5qFE7aa	did u share this problem with ur sister??? wat she said???<br>  yes... u should ask dis to ur sister ASAP....just be frank...<br>  she is ur sister....she will sort this out and just chillax...and Just forget abt ur ex... Its time to grab some new... dont u??<br>  all the best..|`|AA11706291	It'll all blow over soon enough, they'll split.<br>  <br>  You're right the age gap is to big for such a young age which is another reason why it's obvious it won't work.|`|8HDQMkSBaa	get ovet it....it is really worth getting THAT upset about...He dumped you so why would you care who he goes out with...In time he'll dump her too and then you'll feel better|`|SOx6VwYCaa	Well your sister should find someone her own age , so tell it like it is!!|`|v0MGb17Saa	your ex and sister are weird.. your life sucks|`|1R4x0CRdaa	fact f life|`|M2dr9Ykzaa	wow, thats low, your sister is being soo mean! im sure you have already talked to her before, but you should really get your point acroos to her again. I dont even understand 1) why she would want to date a 16 year old and 2) why she would do that to you??<br>  i feel really bad for you, and i think that if your sister continues to do what shes doing, you should make her feel really terrible about herself,i know that sounds mean, but look whats shes doing to you! she should feel horrible about what she doing to you<br>  stay strong, good luck :D|`|goY0JHzlaa	There's just an unspoken rule to not date your family's or friend's ex. Number one, it's gross.<br>  Number two, They both must be desperate.<br>  Number three, if your sis knows this hurts you, then shame on her.<br>  <br>  Just stay away from them both. Neither one of them is worth it. The best thing you can do is act like it doesn't bother you. Your sis is going to get a kick out of your jealousy and so will the ex. So don't give them the pleasure. Don't worry. People like this are usually their own worst enemies. Karma is a *****. What comes around goes around.|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	My sister did this to me when we were in high school (we're twins) and I was so upset because she chose herself over me. But the fact is, he was my ex and she was my sister. I had to decide if her dating my ex was big enough of a deal to ruin our relationship. And honestly, it's not. He's an ex for a reason. And she's your sister. Maybe tell her how you feel about it and talk it through together. That way you both can understand each other better.|`|dkzsbUy9aa	I think the only thing you can do is talk to your sister about this, your have to tell her she is being a ********* by doing this to a family member, you must tell her that she is really hurting you on the inside and she will understand, 16 to 20 isnt right|`|AA11506593	I thought there was a rule about siblings dating exes! Seems like your sister missed that memo.<br>  <br>  Look, your ex bf obviously thinks your sister is hot. Who can blame him -- she's 20 and he's 16.<br>  <br>  But what does your sister see in a child? Why would she date a kid? Answer -- just to tick you off!|`|iW9GBrg6aa	I would be pretty pissed too. A sister going out with your ex-boyfriend? That is just wrong.  Well hopefully your sister will realize what she is doing is not right.  Maybe she's desperate to go after your taste in guys and she can't find anyone else either than your ex.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	It was wrong of her but there a tons of guys out there and chances are it won't work out for her either.  The age difference is enough to make it not last long unless your sister acts like a 16 yr old.|`|dYa5AEwSaa	jajajaj it is bad for you, but you should have careful with your sister because that, can continue at future and, won`t you never have a boyfriend, due at her sister|`|zFZ2EAsmaa	Its okay, just dont worry about it. Get over him.. things will be okay. I know it's hard but you can do it. Apparently he is a jerk and would rather hurt you then love you.. he's not worth it<br>  <br>  <br>  [xX.Hailee.Xx]|`|epywmmHjaa	She can do it too you quite easily.

tU5NJVL3aa	Because of what was done to you, it won't be easy nor can it "just happen" -- if your bf is patient then you can just keep going as you have... just take your time and eventually the barriers will become less an less significant.  By the way, does he know about your past and what that means in terms of your ability to "let your guard down"?|`|T1CuRwm3aa	I hope you will report your father.  that will be a good start|`|0le6RYndaa	You're 16, you don't understand love.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Find a support group to help you get through this.  What happened to you will affect you for the rest of your life.  You will always have a suspicion and will mistrust men.  For the rest of your life.  You need to learn how to try to live with it as best as you can.   There are others that were abused too and  only someone that went through it will be able to understand and help you.  Good luck.|`|CQnlxYk4aa	It's understandable, you need to start living. Meaning you have to get up again and start living your life. There will be bumps on the road and learning to unjust to them is part of life. Life will not be perfect for no one, just be carefully to not repeat your mistakes. Your a young lady so don't rush into love. Love is a powerful word, try to be best friends first so you can build with trust issues. Good luck.|`|v96pYAg1aa	U could just hug him for a long time and hope for the best u trust him then let him get close to u kiss on the cheek any thing or just let him know what ur feeling|`|lywRBk4Kaa	One day, you will look back on the feelings you're having now from a different perspective.  Any time I know I need to make a tough decision, I ask myself how I would make that decision ten years from now.  The world is an ugly place in which every step you take must be carefully placed.  Feelings are fragile things, a wise person would handle them as such.|`|jXyYgpFHaa	Being only 16, I honestly think you should be working on yourself before working on any type of relationship. You will have plenty of time for relationships in there future but if you don't concentrate on yourself now, it will only get harder with time and it will continue to affect your future relationships. I'd say seek professional help for yourself, not for any relationship.|`|B5zoRUYWaa	hey i know EXACTLY to the T what you are going thru!!! im 16 as well and from the time i was 3 to the time i was 8 i was sexually abused by my 17 year old cousin.. and from him doing that it has made me abolutely PETRIFIED of sex or do anythng physical with a guy becasuse i honestly dont trust them even tho they didnt do anything wrong! but im in a relationship with a guy who is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! we have been datiing for 2 and a half years and we havent had sex yet but im always thinking about it because i want to show him that i love him and i want to share that special connection with him but im way to scared!! but the only thing i can tell you because i can totally relate is just sit him and down and explain to him why you have youre guard up and tell him that you really do love him but something like that is really hard to get over and if he loves like he says he does then he will inderstand and he will stick by you thru thick and thin! i hope everything works out for you!|`|qf0kuMCiaa	At 16 you do feel love just in a 16 year old way..So you do know what love is..You have every right to keep your guards up because you been hurt. Don't let them down just yet until you know and sometime we never will know when it is safe to do so. Just take your time and listen . DO you believe in god? the reason why I ask he can heal your broken heart, you do need it healed  you can email me if you ever need someone to listen to you, because I feel your pain I know people say they do but really I do I been to hell and  back so I know.
509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	I think he is cheating.  You don't hold off the trip for both of your birthdays and the Valentine's day.  All important days were together, it is like nothing else to celebrate until Christmas.  If a guy cares, he wouldn't treat you that way.|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	Leave and be done.|`|1F6KJt0oaa	Sounds like you need to settle down.  I know that sounds like such crap but you do.  There are a ton of reasons that trips will be put off.  So far he hasn't given you a legitimate reason to worry so just roll with it.  He may be cheating but if he isn't then spying is just going to end it when he finds out and he will.|`|C9QQPROkaa	I know its not easy and is this a log distance relationship? If so i would suggest finding someone a bit easier to get to. If this guy truly loves you he would reassure you that nothings wrong and not be so quick to say you need to take time and find yourself. It seems like its a way to break up with you when they play the blame game. I would suggest leaving him.
AA10874773	oh girl, it sounds like you got a real situation.  tell him if he's not attracted to you anymore to leave, or you could leave.  the point is, absence makes the heart grow stronger.  If he misses you, he'll appreciate you & want you back.  If he doesnt miss you - atleast you didnt waste any more time on him.  he'll always be your baby's daddy, but he doesnt always have to be your man.  remind him of that!|`|79wOWoM0aa	You married the wrong "man".  This is a risk you take when you marry when you are nearly a child.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but like all 19 year olds you also are a poor judge of your own maturity.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure you just think I'm a butt hole here, but one day you'll understand.|`|AA11315360	There is something wrong here. If a man doesnt want sex or harass you to have sex frequently then he is either cheating on you (meaning he cant have sex because he has no desire because he is getting it else where) OR he has a series porn Obsession.<br>  <br>  You need to get him to stop the porn and see a couples counselor immediately.<br>  If he wont change sadly you will have to divorce him because he sounds obsessed with porn.|`|jDT8yH7Raa	sounds like he is taking you for granted and he is no longer attracted to you for some reason. some guys don't think mothers are attractive.  sounds like you are also doing too much, maybe you need to back up and do less and he just might raise an eyebrow.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Well, sadly this relationship sounds a bit immature. What grown person would use the words - cry baby. <br>  Any man that would hurt you like that isn't worth it. Obviously people think you are an attractive girl, but what do you think? Personally if I were you I'd leave this guy and start over. First thing is to figure out who you are as a person, do things for you, build some confidence on WHO you are not just what you look like. And the next guy that comes around will respect you a lot more.|`|DvnOIx1laa	Oh my god, I feel for you!!! Porn is responsible for the demise of many many marriages!!! I was married at 19 too, and the very same thing happened. My now ex husband was completely addicted to porn, I too (not to be cocky) am a very attractive woman, nothing worked to save our marriage, even counseling, so I left.<br>  I am now re-married to a wonderful man, and we have my son from the previous marriage, and a daughter together.<br>  I am not saying you should  leave, just saying, maybe get some counseling, and if that doesnt work, then you might need to cut your losses and find someone who can appreciate you beauty (the inside and the out)<br>  Sorry your going through such a rough time though hun, hang in there!!|`|AA11705300	Only your husband has the answers to 'why' and what you can do. I suspect that it has little to do with sex, though. If you are committed to making a marriage work, you adjust expectations, try to talk things through and you are a whole lot more specific about your complaints than he is. <br>    Marriage counseling would help get to the true issues. In the meantime, if he doesn't want the marriage to work, you could be Pamela Anderson and he would still reject you - but he would pick a different reason. Then you might seem TOO slutty. Ms. Anderson doesn't succeed in her own marital life so go figure.<br>    He's using the porn to avoid you, not because that is the only thing that he likes in the whole world. He's determined to use that as a reason and the obsession makes it seem like he can't control himself when it comes to porn. He wants out of the marriage and he's looking for something he knows you can't handle. Making yourself into a porn star isn't going to change the situation - he'd suddenly decide it's something else or worse, someone else he wants.<br>     Marriage counseling seems to me to be the only option. If he won't go, there's very little you can do.

It won't work out in the long run if he's going to fuss and not be supportive about something that is important to you.|`|cLGVSuFqaa	if he wants to leave you because you changed your religion<br>  then you have no other choice than to leave him before he leaves you|`|bZGv0dvnaa	nah he was cheating on u.....|`|uQDh86A1aa	I am sorry you are in this unfortunate situation.  Life may feel lost without him, but if he is leaving you over your religion, he would have left anyhow.  Such a man is shallow and not worth your time, however much in love with him you are.  Your long term happiness with such a man is short lived.  <br>  <br>  However, your happiness in the religion that you feel is best for you is going to be far longer lasting.  How can we be happy if we are not serving our God to the best of our abilities anyhow?  And if forced the choice, is it God or our boyfriends we want to serve?<br>  <br>  Take hope.   God knows you are hurting and surely has a plan for you specifically that will bring love, joy and happiness.

0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	This is a bit tricky. You have a legal right to see your Dad, and your Mom has a legal obligation to allow it. If she stops you, your dad could make a case for 'parental alienation' or 'alienation of affection', and that's not good. <br>  <br>  Try this, sit down with your Mom, and let her know that you are thinking about seeing your dad and would like to know her side of it. Let her know that you want to do this because you miss him.<br>  <br>  From a fathers point of view, regardless of the tension or resentment between parents, it's in your best interests to maintain a healthy relationship with both parents. It's the responsibility of both parents to encourage this. They seriously need to take into account your feelings.<br>  <br>  Mom might be protective for some reason. This will show itself in defensiveness. Try to encourage her to inform you of her reasons.<br>  <br>  Be patient and try to be understanding. It's probably not easy for either of your parents, or for you either.|`|QzWHMGHJaa	You don't have to ask her, you have every right to see your Father weather she like it or not!  It's against the law for her to keep you from him anyway!  If he gave up his rights to you, he wouldn't be paying child support and there would be no reason for them to go back to court!  So someone lied to you or you misunderstood!  Just inform your Mother that you are going to start seeing your Father and that you don't want to hear anything about it!  What a horrible woman to keep you from knowing your Father!|`|peckUVpzaa	Its the opposite with me i cant stand my dad and I just recently said i didn't want to see him anymore.|`|AA11706291	Just sit down and talk to your mom, tell her what you want.|`|cLGVSuFqaa	guilt trip her into it<br>  say you really miss him and its not fair<br>  you have a right to see your own father|`|8IHfytEvaa	How old are you?<br>  <br>  There might be a reason why you should not see him which has not been told you.<br>  <br>  You should ask your Mom what happened and why they were divorced.<br>  <br>  You might remember what happened.<br>  <br>  Some times Moms tell the truth about this type of thing and sometimes they don't.<br>  <br>  I know in my case my wife tried her best for 7 years to convince my children that I am evil.<br>  <br>  This was after she was accused 2x of abusing our children and then she was sent to a shrink and then to a mental hospital.<br>  <br>  One of her accusers was a social worker who called 911 and sent the cops to our house on a rare evening when I was not home and they were.<br>  <br>  The 2nd accuser was our Pediatrician, a lady MD, who accused her only 16 days after the first incident.<br>  <br>  About the time one of my children were about ten years old, I learned from that child how Mom was trying to poison their minds against me.<br>  <br>  I would eventually file for diovrce to prevent the abuse and the brainwashing and the courts agreed and awarded me sole custody of my children.<br>  <br>  My children did see their Mom every other weekend by after six months she only wanted to see them once a month and by 3 or 4 years later she moved away and has rarely seen them since.<br>  <br>  While still in high school, my now ex was attending a different church and she told the pastor of that church that she was divorced from an abusive man and she has sole custody of her children.<br>  <br>  She went on to tell this new Pastor, the reason you've never seen my children is that they are away at college.<br>  <br>  This was while my children lived with me and the oldest was still in high school.<br>  <br>  I said all that to say this:<br>  <br>  Ask your Mom but don't be surprised if you don't hear the truth.<br>  <br>  If you are scheduled to be in court, tell the judge you want to see your Dad.<br>  <br>  Unless there is a lot of history of abuse, abuse you may be too young to remember, the judge will probably allow it.<br>  <br>  Then ask your Dad for his version of the story.<br>  <br>  Then you'll have to figure out which one to believe.<br>  <br>  See if there is a church in your area which teaches a Divorce Care Class.<br>  <br>  There is a Divorce Care program of children of divorce.  See if you can take that class.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.divorcecare.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.divorcecare.org/</a>|`|goY0JHzlaa	You need to talk with your mom and be honest. Ask her why she is against you seeing him. SHe may have very good reasons for doing so.|`|yZVJaHt4aa	I would say just talk her. She has to understand that he is your family and you just want to see him..<br>  <br>  Im sure she will understand<br>  <br>  Hope everything works out okkayy
axCFlk5Zaa	For some crazy reason, girlfriends want you to look at them like that and no one else. <br>  <br>  I wonder why?|`|AA10873763	Maybe you need better porn.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	Most women see it as an unrealistic expectation to live up to.  Let her know that she is what you want, not the so called perfect girls from the porno.  She might come around.  Also, if you do talk her into it, it would help if you rented a porn that was directed by a woman.  They are a little easier on a girls first introduction.|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	She probably feels that if you find those girls and what they do interesting, then she doesn't quite qualify, so that's making her insecure. Don't ask her about it, and don't compare your last gf to it-that will make it worse. Your last relationship has NOTHING to do with your current one so don't bring it in. If watching porn is such a big deal for you, then I feel bad for the girl you're dating. Maybe you should give it up for a bit and concentrate on her. If it's still a big deal, maybe she'll try it out one day. For now, let it go, because it's not a big deal.|`|fFpQWwRbaa	dude, look at what your saying. for one it makes no difference what u and ur last gf did if she doesn't want to do it don't make her and second of all, most girls don't like their bf looking at naked girls, i suggest u take ur eyesof the porn and put them on ur gf.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Because she's insecure and feels threatened by a bunch of silicone air-brushed fantasy girls. <br>  It's pathetic really.|`|xVah6Etoaa	bec. ur only supposed to be looking at her...she's jealous clearly and extremely insecure|`|5mTKspfYaa	some people like it and some people don't...  in your GF case it makes her feel inadequate.<br>  <br>  what if you accidentally found a sex toy that was 10 times your size and ran on a gas powered motor...  it would make you feel inadequate as well.<br>  <br>  So put yourself in her position.  Find a compromise.  Maybe she would like SOME form of pornography, just not the kind you like.  So have open dialogue with her about it.  Tell her that you think she is sexy and that the movies are just a part of what turns you and maybe she could try some form of it to see if she feels the same way.  Then you can share something together.|`|9AobEMysaa	I would only guess that maybe its a big turn off for her. She might just want to hang out with you and not sit by the t.v watching others have sex. Also she might feel like your tryingg to get something out of her by watching porno with her. She just may not see it as romantic and more as a turn off.|`|vRKVatcwaa	For me personally, I don't like watching porn mostly cuz it's super fake and stupid. It doesn't seem hot or sexy to me at all. Now... I do enjoy amateur porno with real couples. Now that is hot! My boyfriend doesn't like porn (really) but I'll watch sometimes before he gets home from work and then pounce on him. The "real" porn is way better for girls. Try that.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Probably because she feels inadequate because she thinks that you watching porn means that she isn't satisfying you. I think you should dump her and get back with your ex girlfriend, because she sounds very open minded and perverted.|`|dOb3OMWTaa	you do no girls do not like looking at other girls naked and stuff and you can not force her to and if she said no the first time don't ask her anymore|`|ze4Gt1araa	Because why should she watch porn when she has a boyfriend which is you! Don't make her watch porn do it with her!|`|ooXzW8Hdaa	Because that means your perverted|`|YRYyZQoDaa	she feels that she should be enough and by you checking our porn it is a form of betrayer to her.

After all, bigger is better! And, I'm sure you don't want to ditch her, because you really care about her, but in order for you to feel sexually attractive to her, she needs those big racks! But, forcing her into it, will only make matters worse. But, since I'm a breast man as well here are some suggestions:<br>  1)give it to her as a gift. That way you don't have to be rude, and shallow. But of course, you may have to pay for them. IF YOU WANT THE BEST OF THINGS, YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE.<br>  2) convince her that this will make her the perfect woman for you!<br>  3)be fair. Come to an agreement to change something about yourself, and she will do the same. Understand? Having a better relationship with someone involves some give and takes--agreements!<br>  4)Here's a little secrets about women..women by nature are jealous creatures...women are always attempting to outdo their rivals in areas they feel they are lacking. So use jealousy. Express how you feel about women with big racks, like Carmen Electra, Tara Reid, Dolly Parton, or any other female celebrities on T.V., or on the magazines in front of your girl. Good strategy?<br>  5)convince her that it's for her self-esteem. Do it as if you care about her appearance, not for a selfish reason. Use articles on celebrities, and real-life people to prove how it improve their confidence, and self-esteem to get more out of life.<br>  6)buy her clothes to express how amazing she would look with for her big racks!<br>  7)If none of these ideas work, falsely, tell her that you will ditch her, or get friends that she doesn't know to approach her and make fun of her raisin size ****. It's wrong, but there are some men that are still dogs! LOL|`|fb5d7O6Saa	You shouldn't force her. If you don't like her the way that she is, maybe her breasts aren't the problem. It may be that you are superficial. Looks are a help but they aren't the most important factor of a person.

bqkfu6Diaa	Only if he and his wife are mature enough to be okay with it. Being married for 15 years, that should make them each at least 33 years old, and I would HOPE that maturity kicked in by then.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Of course, why wouldn't it be?  As long as he can afford it with out the rest of you suffering.|`|zL1sggpCaa	Are these buddies males or females? Where is he going? And why isn't his wife invited?|`|MvC6n3DWaa	I would not like that his buddies are single. If he occassionally went away with his friends, big deal, all of us are entitled. If it is frequently, more than once a year, I would question his priorities. Time away can be healthy, constant time away is trying to really get away! <br>  <br>  The tone of your question tells me you are not okay with it. Has he given you reason to be conerned or do you tend to be clingy? That is something only you can answer. Everyone needs some space. Just make sure you know what kind of space he is seaking and that they are not doing single guy things, like girl hunting. If it is limited to the fight, take the time to pamper yourself!|`|tCiVuFK9aa	Sure, but it mainly depends on what type of trip you are planning.  Like are you going on a hunting or a fishing trip?  That would be fine of course.  Are you going to someplace like Vegas where you plan on going clubbing and drinking your eyeballs out.  No of course not, this type of behavior could lead to something that you couldn't take back.  So I guess it all depends on the type of trip you are planning.<br>  Red|`|ByUS0k8waa	Well I guess it would depend on what is going out of town for. I personally trust my husband and if he wanted to I would let him. However, my husband and I are joined at the hip so we wouldn't take trips out of town without each other.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	yes<br>  <br>  He needs time to pursue his hobbies<br>  <br>  Golf, Bowling and other out of town outings will make you grow closer.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Why wouldn't it be?   Since when do you "own" all the time of the person you're married to if they have a special and rare opportunity to see old friends and do something like this?  Of course, the "door swings both ways" should the wife want to do the same once or twice a year with friend's and there is someone to watch the kids, etc., why not? <br>  <br>  My husband and I did this for years with no problems, we had one son. What's the big deal?  He did ski trips, camping and rock climbing trips, sailing, etc.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|pRF5LLloaa	if he is not going to be "messing around" then sure.  Why not?<br>  <br>  it is ALSO OK for his WIFE to do the same with her buddies.  Make arrangments, let HIM take care of the kids and the house, and SHE takes a mini=-vacation.|`|fysEkCIUaa	The answer to that question is inside you.  Do your trust your husband enough to let him out of your sight for that long?  And if not, then  you have some serious problems in your marriage that need to be addressed.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Sure, why not?  Aren't we all more than just spouses and parents?  It's good to have some time to regroup your true being - and what better way then with the company of friends?|`|ikXRqWxUaa	depends on what he is doing while out of town.  you have not given anywhere near enough info to answer this.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	Yes|`|EX3xAtoWaa	Does not seem like a bad idea to me, you DO trust your husband right?|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	sure!|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	I agree that we need more info.  As a general rule, I think that married men should never spend the night without his wife...<br>  <br>  Except in work-related cases.<br>  <br>  Or hunting trips.<br>  <br>  Or various other manly-man activities...<br>  <br>  So I need more info.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Ah, a fight.  Yeah, I would let him go.  Just because his buddies are single, doesn't mean that HE is going to act like he's single.  I am a strong advocate of husbands being allowed to have male-bonding.<br>  <br>  (And maybe you can go to an overnight spa with your girlfriends sometime later?)|`|ODYrypwaaa	The way you set up the question, my answer would be yes.  Married men should have friends and an all guy weekend is great.  However, if there is a trust issue then maybe not.  If you are suspecting it won't be an all guy thing, or maybe the friends are not responsible.  Also as long has the husband is not trying to abandon responsibilities at home... Is the wife being left at home with many small children?  Can the family afford this trip? Is the wife being neglected? and so on...|`|4JrDGW7Taa	No! Unless you are going on a business trip!|`|93ix6nyvaa	Depends on how often these "4 days, 3 nights" trips happen. If it's once in a while, I think it's acceptable. But if it's pretty frequent, then it might pose a problem...|`|yotUSWcIaa	Its perfectly fine. Look if he really must, and is bound to tbh, but no touch. And make sure of that.
Eug52iQDaa	They understand exactly what they're doing.  It's all about them.  Limit the time you spend with them and take control of your life back.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	No..they don't.<br>  <br>  They just "think" they are always right and everyone else is wrong.|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	I think most folks like that have been told, whether they believe it or not, so they're certainly aware.  Why, even silent responses (the "look") make their point.<br>  It's not easy ignoring other's looks and comments...it's an art.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	Nope, they have no idea.|`|z4V9kdR8aa	Yes.|`|kANR98tIaa	nope|`|CmFldVDHaa	mostly they don't know, but they will realize it.<br>  <br>  but remember:<br>  *not all controlling people are selfish<br>  *they just want everything is set and all right<br>  *try to understand why are they controlling-maybe theres a reason<br>  *minimizing time with them is not a good solution<br>  *your friend and your mother loves you and take time to realize its all for you|`|5iyeZFtHaa	I would say yes. They probably wouldn't be controlling if they knew they couldn't do it successfully.
lkhCeAdJaa	*friends* do not talk about making love together.  If the discussion has turned to that, you have already left the realm of simply *friendship*and entered something new.<br>  <br>  If there is no hope for a relationship, then its time to end this *friendship*.  if there can be a relationship, then be honest about your feeling to him.|`|Eug52iQDaa	OK so you're both married and have been friends for years.  Started talking over the internet.  Safe, right?  No.  It's completely unrealistic.  You have no family pressures, daily grind - it's not reality.  It's incredibly romantic, but it's a fantasy.  Get back to real life, sweetie.  This is a huge mistake.|`|PN7XMglOaa	I fell in love with my best friend and next week we will be celebrating our 17th wedding anniversary .
ek1193Qiaa	just ask him where he is from....what he wants to do when he gets older....where he works.....his hobbies.....what he does for extra activites....stuff like that<br>  <br>  <br>  or just make corny jokes.....they may sound stupid to you but to some guys they are cute|`|dhDuhtxAaa	Ok I can help you here. I am a guy, so I know what to say!<br>  <br>  1.Ask questions. This is an easy way to start convos and find out more about him. <br>  2.Dont talk too much about yourself. <br>  3.You dont need to impress him, always be the one he is trying to impress<br>  4. Listen to him and boost his ego with compliments. But always throw in some cheeky put downs to make him feel a bit on edge. You want to stimulate the side of him that makes him want to earn your respect.<br>  5. Learn how to tell funny stories. People love a good story!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, check my source for further reading.|`|RsDAGnBhaa	Well i love talking about random things haha. You could be like, i love chicken nuggets haha do you? random stuff or maybe like what's his favorite color, little stuff that make up a person, what does he like? hate? =] i never run out of stuff to talk about haha<br>  <br>  hope this helps =D good luck|`|GsSRY7quaa	try asking about his family, heritage, what his likes and dislikes are. Music, movies, artists, hobbies...there are so many questions to ask and so little time to ask them. does he have any birth marks / tats?|`|LJik2RjRaa	Ask him what interests him.  Seeing as you've just met him it's not too surprising that you can't have a long detailed conversation.|`|S0f1au1kaa	just let him start the conversations. or talk about current events like at school or in the news or t.v. <br>  <br>  trust me there are tons of things to talk about.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.<br>  <br>  miaSue:)|`|HNQU9V6Haa	yu just needa chill wit him and see if yu can hold a convo with him because if yu cant then yu cant be wit him|`|qf0kuMCiaa	Are you a shy person?|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Stop talking and listen to him.

Follow his lead.|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Ask him out lol, if you really can't talk then go see a movie.|`|PNnYTqyzaa	Well, it depends where you know him from.<br>  <br>  If it's school or something education based then ask about schoolwork, lessons, students etc.<br>  <br>  If from some other situation then ask about his personal life more. Friends, family, hobbies etc. (this also applies if you know him from school)<br>  <br>  The conversation should be fairly relaxed, don't stress about it! The more you talk, the more comfortable you'll be and the conversation will flow.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|0e89f52b231c48ad3d0c71d28feee3bdaa	Ask him to hang out...go see a movie or something and see where a conversation or things go from there!|`|I80ozj3kaa	try thinking of things before u see him so when u do u have something to say.|`|6X2p6Zkwaa	same situation on here!!!!!! i no how u feel!;-]
dIYgPp5Iaa	Ok so everyone is gonna tell you that its stupid for her to have sex and if she gets pregnant and stds and so on and so forth... but all you can really do is tell her to be safe and to use protection if she doesnt then thats her choice|`|5P3Y5CyHaa	You need to make sure that she knows that if they do this he could go to jail and be labeled a sex offender.  <br>  <br>  Sex is a very personal thing, she needs to make sure that he is the right guy.  She will always be tied to this person for the rest of her life.  She will remember it and always have feelings for this guy even when they break up, if they do. She can't forget about all the STDs that are out there to.  If she does get pregnant then they will be tied by that and if that happens then it will come out that they had sex and the guy will probably end up in jail and labeled as a sex offender.  Birth control and condoms are not full proof.  <br>  <br>  If she decides that they can't wait at least until she is legal, they need to know the facts of what could happen.   <br>  <br>  i would urge her to talk to her parents or a responsible adult (a counselor, pastor, minister, or doctor) about it before doing anything.|`|qpMX2Mhxaa	She's going to do it no matter what, and it really shouldn't be such a tainted subject. It's her choice whether she tells her parents or not, so I'd just step out the way and let her get on with it. <br>  <br>  She's in a relationship, and both parties have agreed to it. There's no pressure. If they're both happy with their decision, why stand in the way? Sex is normal, and people make such a big deal of it nowadays. <br>  <br>  Don't feel that you have to get involved. Offer her support, make sure she truly wants to do it, and make sure they're safe. There's a greater risk of her parents finding out if there's a preganancy involved...|`|Vvecns23aa	do not talk to her parent unless you want to be a bad friend.<br>  you need to just stay out of it.<br>  tell her exactly what you think about it then just leave it.<br>  you cant make decisions for her, so don't try.<br>  she will do whatever she wants in the end anyways.|`|e98RKB35aa	she fell right into the trap of the guy charm.

Its not like she is going to listen to you is it, I mean if she has made her mind up she will do it. Underage or not virginity seems to be something that has to be got rid of as quickly as possible.<br>  I would tell her to do what she wants, you on the other be sensible and take care of your emotional and sexual health until you are old enough to know the meaning of love and sex that go hand in hand.|`|AA12135516	She's young & crazy & you are in an awkward situation. Being underage is bad news to start with but on top of that she should be thinking about pregnancy & std's. People think it won't happen to them but it very easily can. The trouble is if you go to her parents then she'll probably never trust you again so, unfortunately, sometimes in these situations all you can do is try to make her see sense & if she doesn't listen then just be there to pick up the pieces cos she's liable to need you if something goes wrong. Good Luck!|`|AA11230878	Firstly it illegal for him to have sexual intercourse with an underage female and she should be open with her parents who should advise her to visit her GP and also use some form of contraception if she must indulge in sex|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Tell them it's illegal but to use contraception if they go ahead.|`|3tnVVFjHaa	tell her its a mistake.talk it over with her parents.
nCWjdyddaa	If your current arrangement works for everyone involved, then that's fine. Just be sure that you are good guests, which means you help out with the expenses and the work. Keeping a house for four people is a lot harder than keeping it up for one. Maybe when your husband isn't working, he can do some housekeeping and maintenance. Also, talk openly with your Dad about the length of time you may be staying. Don't tell him 3 months if it's going to be 12-18.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|AA11706291	If you think you and your husband can deal with living with your father and he can handle you guys living with him then I don't see why not if its going to build a better future for you and your family.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Your dad clearly has the space and is willing to house you, so I don't see the problem. He probably likes the company and especially enjoys having his granddaughter around. <br>  So, if it gets you on your feet faster, I say stay there.|`|lSGNCKitaa	Live with your dad, it also gets the men time to bond. hahah. <br>  <br>  (:|`|FyN7U0p9aa	One thing you have to be aware of is that when you borrow money or live with a parent you are giving them permission and some authority into your life and finances.<br>  <br>  I am someone who has lived with my parents as an adult and had our adult children live with us.<br>  <br>  My warning would be to not to get settled in and comfortable which can cause a person to not keep the goals that were set in the beginning.<br>  <br>  Stay focused on getting moved out within a year and half or sooner.<br>  <br>  Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University is a great teaching and helped thousands get out of debt.<br>  We went to it at a church and it only cost us $30 to go through the course.<br>  It helped get us on the right track at the beginning of our marriage and we still use so many of the principals.  Very easy to follow.<br>  We were surprised how much money we were able to gain.|`|pRF5LLloaa	If it is OK with your Dad, then do it.<br>  <br>  In order to improve your credit, you MUST pay him some rent, and he MUST give you receipts for it, since he cannot report it to the credit bureau.  if you live "for free" or don't get those receipts, then this will NOT help your credit.<br>  <br>  If you have bad credit (like those car garnishments) they WILL stay on your credit report for 3-5 years -- period.  There is NOTHING you can do to remove them.  Staying with Daddy won't help that.<br>  <br>  What it WILL help is to allow you to SAVE up and make a sizable down payment, thus reducing your monthly payment and possibly your interest rate.<br>  <br>  So if it is OK with Dad then move in.  but PAY RENT and SAVE for a down payment.|`|goY0JHzlaa	As long as you contribute to the living expenses that will be incurred with you staying there. I don't see a problem with it. Money management seems to be a problem. Times are hard. Maybe you should try some financial counseling. You could find something free and set up a plan to help you out of your debt. Just don't let you dad foot all the bills for ya. At least pay rent and help with the utilities.

Eug52iQDaa	Friends are not about playing word games.  When you see him tonight, ask him how he took the phrase 'it's a date'.  You can laugh then at your freaking out or deal with him assuming that it was a date and go from there.  If you aren't honest, you'll get caught up in all kinds of neurotic thoughts.  Get things out in the open and be better friends (or more if that's your mutual decision).|`|BMEMH7JLaa	YES he does|`|1f93fe056a8941a67a5c0373d1ae4e0baa	He will get over it. Just make sure everything you do that day is sooooo not date like.|`|jztZxJ5paa	ask him even though you might be scared don't be i d k if he is a nice guy but trust your heart listen to it ok and add me|`|811ea9ca2ab8061aef7359c396ed9139aa	i dont think he was freaked out. people get busy, you know?
uBssj3Znaa	yes|`|UgcPxd4maa	My sis in law almost left my bro while 5 months pregnant due to that shady a** s*hit!!! He should not be txting another girl what so ever!|`|xGofrX5Iaa	No, don't worry until he starts texting her 200 times a day.|`|fR2Geezcaa	Did you really have to ask this? You know the answer! <br>  <br>  He is a dog and you need to drop him asap!|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Hell, YES!! >:(|`|T1CuRwm3aa	Yes you should.  He's a player|`|AA11988604	nah, I'm sure they are just discussing how much he loves you.  in depth apparently....|`|8vfCRg7Caa	depends on how you know about these text. are you reading his text messages? i would suggest not to. Or is he telling you hes texting this girl when you ask <br>  "who are you texting". 100 times a day is a lot. i think you should have gave the real amount you think it is. If it bothers you tell him. Dont go reading his text messages or anything else. And i would focus on if you guys are spending time together and are having fun and rarely argue. if not, you might want to fix something in your relationship and quit worring about who hes texting.|`|SIWAL8TSaa	ea u should be worried shoot he not testing you, he need to come to his since u need to tell im how u feel, because thats just aint right|`|6286059824182c4e7ff0e287e5969887aa	yes. he's your bf. he should be texting YOU everyday and not some skank who can't get a boyfriend of her own.|`|fysEkCIUaa	I would be if it were happening to me. In fact I would probablty break up with him, and call that one a player.|`|N28zLxtpaa	Unless it's his mom, yes be worried.|`|AA12069899	Ask him if she gives a better BJ.|`|fj1Tk8Nyaa	you shouldn't get in his business. Your job is to make him happy! Do that!|`|hSY0LuCOaa	You obviously already are. unless she's his sister in the hospital dying of liver cancer, what he's doing is something very close to cheating (emotionally if not physically) the only person he should be texting 100 times a day is you, anything else shows a big crush on another woman. NOT ok.|`|bHcjc9Q0aa	yea.my boyfriend did that to me and i knew who he was talking to and i told him that i had a problem with him and i was really pissed, and eventually we broke up because he was still talking to her.we are back together now but it took us a lot of time to talk about it and work things out|`|UrE9xvliaa	Yeah u should definitely be worried..he shouldn't be texting another women more then he texts u..did u find this out by snooping or was he honest about it..? if u were snooping then u must have some trust issues with him already...and if he was honest with u then it "could" be harmless..but he may not be cheating physically but is sounds like he is cheating emotionally..be honest and ask him about it...|`|jXndHFm3aa	Um yes you need to step into this situation and see what he is sending her saying in the text messages if he isn't willing to give up his phone, end the relationship he could be cheating on you.|`|1939a4787cfedfac7deb18c16c99dde2aa	What are you doing looking at his phone?  Sounds like you already have trust issues.  You need to confront him and decide if this relationship is working for the both of you.|`|Iyv8WTTOaa	Not necessarily, most of the time he could be texting his freinds and you just catch him texting her  dont be worryed unless there flirting to a sexual level.|`|sLSBROqUaa	you shouldnt worry because you can always get on my team lol. jk. about 100 times is a hell of alot of text message he could be sexing her.|`|cwtRqiM7aa	You should already know the answer to this one + if a man takes the time to spend on a woman period...he's into her in some way. You should be worried|`|KMmsj9ccaa	not only should you be worried you should be livid and single:)unless the woman is his mother....well....thats even a lot to text your mom....|`|1F6KJt0oaa	Yes it doesn't matter what it is about be worried.|`|vRKVatcwaa	I'm sorry hun but what a stupid question! Does he text you more than 100 times a day? I'm guessing no.|`|yUgGedQpaa	heck yeah....what do the messages say?...i mean..if it is just buddy stuff..then i dont see too big of a problem...but that is kinda wierd|`|hIzQyflqaa	of course! id be worried if mine texted them once a day!|`|x2kqq0IJaa	yes, of course. who is that woman? not normal|`|V6MdE2mDaa	yes.|`|FQxUpc9baa	if u had to ask the question then what do u think??!!|`|6otZ5lwYaa	is it for business? if he seems to be enjoying these texts with said woman, the HELL YES!|`|g9TxgMlwaa	Uh.. duh! what do you think?
yUgGedQpaa	camping, reading, swimming, movies, shopping, archade, mall,|`|Eug52iQDaa	Read.  Books are incredible.  Your imagination can take you places without leaving the room :)|`|HIILWvnpaa	Just attempt to have fun?
c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Is there a reason they don't like him? Are you giving up college to do this? If he loves you now, and it is real, it will wait for a year. Families are not likely to be disliking him without a good reason. You are very young, the rest of your life (until death do you part) is unimaginable right now. Do you have jobs? Budget? Apartment? Plans for family? differences in religion? How was he raised? How will you raise children? Who will discipline? How? What would happen if he was offered a job far away? What if you were? What would you do if you became pregnant and the baby was challenged in some way or handicapped? <br>  My point is that there is a LOT that I am SURE you haven't discussed. Just a physical attraction does not mean you are in love or could live together successfully!<br>  Talk with your parents, find out their concerns. If you are ready to marry, you will be able to convince them.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Why don't they like him?  Sometimes family can see things that we can't when we're in love.  If you don't think that's the case, well then just gush to them that so and so proposed and you're getting married in whatever month.  Act super happy and excited.  If you have a venue picked out or anything like that, tell them about it.  It'll be a lot harder for them to be negative when you're being really positive.  You are 18 though and just graduating high school, so be prepared for the lectures on being too young and waiting for after college, ect.  Just take it in stride and understand their concerns.  Good luck!|`|pKzH1cFHaa	You are 18. Wait a bit. Live with him for at least a year. Can you afford an apartment? Bills? Have you really thought this through? Try living with him for a year and deal with the reality of life and living with him.|`|Wd0O06sEaa	I hate to break it to you but usually when family's don't like the boyfriend it's because they see the red flags that you can't see because you are in love. I think you should do what makes you happy, but 18 is a bit young for marriage and the responsibilities that come with it. Why don't you keep dating, just to be sure he's the one?|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Parents usually want good things for their children.<br>  <br>  If your family does not like your boyfriend, it may be because they can SEE things you cannot see...or are unwilling to admit are a problem.<br>  <br>  You are still too young to consider marriage. Marriage is not an easy thing; and even people who are very much in love end up divorced.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you are totally in love with this guy, but your entire life is at stake here. What's the rush? When a man - not a kid- loves a woman, he is willing to wait and to do things to prove he is worthy of her!<br>  <br>  Remember the saying..."Marry in haste...Repent at leisure"!<br>  BE SMART and WAIT !!!|`|IvMPh09baa	stop thinking about it.  its your life, your choice.  if you are happy, it shouldn't matter what anyone else thinks.
5d3cce618f57b550f9f5b932c6752b1aaa	Too cliche? Dude! Not very many guys do that too often anymore. It's always nice to get a surprise every now and then - I'm sure she appreciated the flowers! Good work - you'll go far if you try this hard just to say hi. :)|`|eq820Audaa	Absolutely It's romantic! mainly because so few people do it anymore! And I will guarantee you that you made her day, and made her feel Special, And that was what she was thinking about when she went to sleep that night! Now that's not to say she won't let you down easy.  I mean, She might like someone else that way, there's 1,000 different reasons, and 1'000 different outcomes for this to play out that are totally out of your control. Life is a long pop quiz that you have to learn from to get better at it. When were born were dumber than dirt, Everything has to be learned, I wish i had learned sooner that rejection is part of the process,If you ask 10 girls out and 7 turn you down then Guess what? You've got 3 girls!! And if your to shy or to afraid of being rejected and don't ask at all then you will have no one but yourself and that gets pretty lonely. So congratulations and welcome to the world of dating! You was man enough to start the process in motion so go by the bank when you normally would and get in her line(she wants you to, shes thought and thought about what shes gonna say to you(good news or bad) I mean it's no big deal!! just a friendly gesture to a nice person, Just returning the kindness shes shown you. And remember, Girls like confidence, They like to feel safe and secure with the one there with. Good luck!|`|VeW9PjoVaa	Very romantic. :) Don't be shy. Go back to the bank and see her. Odds are she thinks very highly of you because you took the time to buy her flowers. When you go back ask her if she liked them and if she wants to do something with you sometime. She will think it's worth the try because you took out so much time to do something nice for her.|`|6VaGNhTPaa	well...that is sweet but do u know if she is single because sometimes if they aren't their boyfriend or hubby will get the wrong idea. i think u should go up to her and tell her it was u that sent the flowers. most girls don't like it when guys don't have enough guts 2 actually express themselves or acually be themselves. and if she is single you should ask her to a date odr some thin just make sure ya play it smooth. girls get uncomforable @ times. and if u go 2 the movies make you don't do that arm thing where u yawn and sretch and try to put ur arm  around her. girls don't really like that.|`|G2QNC22eaa	if it was me i would like it <br>  its a nice sweet thought that you put<br>  the effort in to thinking about getting her a gift im sure she will <br>  like it and would have gotten the hint that you like her <br>  dont be afraid to go back in there be confident <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped :) <br>  <br>  <br>  ANSWER MINE PLEASE :)<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqaCuHh7pnZ5z8wUEhZO0Qfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220074548AA3TA4k">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|O32DQvdQaa	that's so sweet and sounds like something that would happen in a movie!|`|B5zoRUYWaa	that is SO!!!!!

I think if she didn't like the flowers than she probably wouldn't be a great partner|`|fQVM8OHmaa	If a guy sent me flowers, I would definitely think he likes me.|`|ntfOcTnWaa	Awwh, that's so cute.<br>  <br>  I definitely think she'll like that a lot, and she will probably think that you do like her.|`|HjXTkHK5aa	Yes i think what you did was really cute.|`|lbEG1WQTaa	go back!!! dont be shy this day and age its rare to get a guy thts romantic!|`|dC7nixE6aa	yea that would absolutely be romantic!! awwhh, that is so sweet!|`|1QURArm3aa	I would love that if i was the girl.Good luck hope u get a date...|`|R6K1Qnosaa	First of all, don't be nervous. If the girl doesn't like you move on, or try even harder. I think she will get a clue that you like her. Flowers is a good way to tell a girl your interested. Ask her on a date as friends and you can get over being shy around her!|`|7Htbfh3Caa	i think it is cute, but u shoulda said something more than hi.|`|4d212271178bbb992af668b3f483f852aa	Flowers are always a sign that a guy likes you, so she'll definatley know :D dnt b nervous, just go to the bank and talk to her otherwise you'll never know what you might miss, bite the bullet and be happy :D|`|1JMaRoyKaa	awwwwwwww thats cute...i think that she will figure out that you like her and maybe she feels the same...i would love a guy to send me flowers sayin hi instead of them being assholes...i think that yu should go see her and tell her how yu feel|`|7UfuqGmcaa	Actually...I think that sending flowers to a girl is amaaaaaaaaaaazing!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't mind it one bit if a guy sent me flowers (even though I'm married) heehehe I would still be flattered<br>  <br>  Hope you two hit it off!!!|`|EhB1Tr3Caa	awwww.<br>  I think that is an incredibly sweet thing to do.<br>  Guys should do more things like that, in my opinion.|`|BQjw14d1aa	I would be soooooooooo flattered!|`|cobGkGC7aa	aww that was very romantic! you had confidence and went after the girl you liked.|`|d5KW3h0Iaa	That is so sweet if I had a guy do that I would feel really appreciated|`|bS7DN85Qaa	Aw, how sweet. Yes.|`|dsf5hGGnaa	I think thats very sweet and dont be nervous she probably really appreciated it.|`|oiNkygNtaa	.....i think i just throw up in my month!|`|uUrJwk7Faa	I think that's very sweet. Hopefully she realizes it's you and she likes you too!! Good luck!|`|TvMiwKjEaa	You should have left your number on the card mate.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	omg thats adorable. if shes not into you she'll jsut make up an excuse, dont worry it shouldnt be awkward to go back.|`|7586a5fb518ea697aa3522e5672f338daa	yes it's romantic.send more but next time give her a hint.|`|qKpgMkjSaa	Obviously I'm not a girl, however I can give you some insight to this. How long have you been talking to her? Does she know who you are? All in all I think this was a very nice gesture! and I think its kind of romantic. I could see myself doing that for a girl I liked. I think if you didnt go back to the bank for awhile it would be mistake. you should stop in and see her again, and casually ask her if she got your flowers and that you just couldn't help but wonder what she might be doing for dinner that night? and if she would like to meet up at a restaurant somewhere in between where you both might live. but be very general so she doesnt think your a stalker.|`|vMKEg29kaa	Gosh! I hope I was that girl ;)<br>  <br>  And the bank's name is? lol|`|SIWAL8TSaa	i think that u maybe lighting that person day and that you should had asked her out in the card and took her too a nice resturant with the same flowers at the table with candles awwwwww that would just beee sooooo nice|`|vuDE5TPbaa	You went through all that now you don't want to see her.<br>  You get your butt to that bank and get some credit.|`|v1xAKwJ4aa	Good Luck Bro! :] If shes any kind of woman she'll be blown away <3<br>  <br>  <br>  :] JC|`|bVRQKOwYaa	thats really cute. but i agree, you should've put your number on the card.|`|GXilXsghaa	Yes.
AA12351337	She took care of you almost 18 years.  I think she has some say in you life.  Whether you listen or not is your choice.  But she took the time to take care of you, whether you were close or not.  Your only 18, she is still wiser than you.<br>  As for the him going to her job.  It's her job.  It doesn't matter whether he is her son or anything.  Him showing up there looking like a homeless person reflected on her....badly.  He doesn't have to impress them, but he also doesn't have to make her look like crap.  Whether you think it truly reflected on her or not.  It did.  You'll see when you get a real job.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	You know she doesn't like him and the way he "sags", yet you bring him to her job?  That is her job.  Impressions are everything.  The bosses pay attention to stuff like that.  Why would you bring him there?  <br>  <br>  Get out.  Get the public housing.  You are over 18 and a mother and if you want your baby's daddy to sleep over, then get your own place.  You don't appreciate anything that she has done for you so just leave as soon as possible.|`|6359LQLNaa	i understand where you're coming from.<br>  and i also understand where she is coming from as well.<br>  she cares about you and the baby, and i think that she's right about you living in the projects. its unsafe for the baby. i think that you should continue to live with her so that you don't have to live on welfare.<br>  and she doesn't like the way your partner dresses because its not presentable and its hard to get a job dressed like that.<br>  i really hope that you get advice from someone close to you who will give you an honest opinion, since i don't know you.<br>  but i think that you are a strong woman who wants the best, and wants to be independant, but i think that you need all the help that you can get right now.|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	Puleeeeeze.  You sound like my sister.  Face the fact your bf is a loser, and you shouldn't have had a baby with him.  Unfortunately you did, and the woman (who is supporting you, btw) is stuck with him whether she likes it or not.  Unfortunately you put her into that position.  Now it's your responsibility to pull it together.  Your "lady who got custody of you", whom you're totally disrespectful toward, isn't the one who needs to change - it's your saggy ***, jobless boyfriend who needs to step up and be a man.|`|TIqFAXo1aa	You should be grateful for all she HAS done for you.   But you need to get out & do it yourself even if it is a ghetto apartment.   <br>  <br>  I would definitely be thankful tho!  Leave in a nice way - let her know you are thankful for her but you feel like it is time for you to do it on your own!|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	If she took care of you for so many years, she must care or you still wouldn't be with her (you and your baby.) She's just looking out for whats good for you. Your boyfriend sagging in her house knowing she doesn't like it is being disrespectful to her. Not to judge him but he most likely wont be getting a good job if he continues to dress like that. First impressions are everything especially in the job world. Why don't both of you try to get jobs so you can rent an apartment together instead of resorting to the projects.
VSVQHKwKaa	What Bella said. She nailed it.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	I think you should concentrate on making a home for your child instead of trying to find your next man.  Try taking care of yourself and treating yourself right and you won't have to worry about choosing poorly in the mate department.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Bella is right!  Set up your life first.  Take care of number one!  When you and your son are self-sufficient and comfortable then you can try dating again.  Just make sure you do not introduce your boyfriends to your son...wait until you are sure he's the "right one" before making introductions.|`|lN5d688gaa	you are fine.  take care of your child and you first.  love comes later.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AA11315360	Be alone for a little while. Then start dating. I suggest you do not introduce your child to a man until you have seen him several times. And be on the look out for men who are sex offenders and like to touch little kids.<br>  Never EVER leave your child alone with a new BF, even if you trust him. Dont leave a man alone with your child until you are married and 100% sure he will not hurt the child. And always ask your child what happened while you were gone.<br>  <br>  I suggest looking for men who also have a child. that way you know they care about kids, have experience with children, and they wont have any negative feelings about you having a child already. Also it helps weed out the possible sexual offenders.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	I agree with the first answer you got.<br>  <br>  Once we have a kid, it's not just about what we want anymore...We have to put the child's well-being and stability first.<br>  <br>  You are still young and you can find a good man to love, who will love you and your child. Of course it's possible!<br>  <br>   But you will have to become more selective and be careful, because it is not a good idea to subject a child to see a lot of men parade as "mommy's boyfriends", either.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Do not settle. Choose a decent man next time.|`|FUMHYrl4aa	Try to marry again right away and find happiness.|`|CCxNiSk7aa	i agrry|`|bSiNAsHJaa	well i have the same problem but i have three kids and i cant leave the asshole cuz he tries to take the kids. although leagally i would probably get them he doesnt work that way, hes very crazy. so i stay until the kids are old enough to make their own decisions. but when i do become single i will not settle down again for years. i rather have my kids and have fun instead of being controlled by a man for the rest of my life. life is too short for all the stress and drama.. just have fun dont worry about another man for a while just meet guys and dont bring them around your kid until you found someone serious cuz thats not cool.|`|xnrGBXHcaa	Bella's answer is a good one. I'm from the other side. I am a male and I found a woman with young children and she is great. She is independent, strong, beautiful, and a wonderful person. We fell madly in love and are now married. We do very well as a family. She had been divorced for 8 years before we met and she thought she would never find anyone. Her aunt set us up on a blind date and we have been together ever since. <br>  <br>  My advice is to be strong and take care of your kids and yourself and if the right guy comes along you will know it. Never give up!
1YdeUn1Caa	Sounds like therapy is needed. My mother treated me like crap, that didn't mean I was going to be out to get her, and be a Lifetime movie of the week.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	sounds just like hes being a dad to be honest. not everyone gets  a good one. just look forward to moving out when you turn 18|`|Eug52iQDaa	Ask them to go to counseling with you and try to salvage the relationship instead of continuing to hurt, sweetie.  Often parents are dolts about the feelings of their children.  Unless you speak up and let them know you're unhappy, but want to make it better for everyone, they probably won't know there's a problem.<br>  <br>  Wanting to hurt them is normal because you're hurt and don't know how to make them love you the way you want them to.  Get some private time with them (or him) and tell him honestly (not whining or accusing) how what he does makes you feel.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, go see a counselor yourself.  You're worth a LOT more than how a parent shows you they feel.  A counselor can help you deal better with the things he's doing.<br>  <br>  (((((((((((Hugs))))))))))|`|AA12398373	The best way to hurt your parents is to never have children of your own, and then later on when they ask you why you aren't making them grandparents, just tell them what you told us here about how your dad taught you what it means to be a parent, and what it's like to be a child in a family of such a parent.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Holy....<br>  <br>  To be honest, it would hurt me a lot to know or think that one of my Kids would have so much contempt for me that they were online asking how to make me miserable.<br>  <br>  Stop and think about what you've said for a moment... if you feel that your suicide would make your Parents hurt... then doesn't that tell you (Because it does me) that you don't really believe your Parents do not love you or care about what happens to you....<br>  <br>  How sad.|`|8HDQMkSBaa	You have some issues!!!|`|goY0JHzlaa	Seek professional help if you are this angry. Maybe the issue is you and not so much your dad. I don't know. I'm not there. But, if you are getting this upset over eating and reading, then, you need to really talk with someone. For your own well being.|`|umUiScliaa	JUst tell him how you feel and then he will understand....dont hurt then they are your parents just be happy and tell him how u feel and then everything will be ok|`|yUgGedQpaa	when you get older you are gonna see how lame you are being right now...i feel sorry for your parents|`|uTIoOa62aa	eek im sorry
NeTNnvSZaa	You have two kids who live with your wife in another state and just got married six months ago?  You don't say if these are your children.  If they aren't your children, then you cannot take the deduction, only one of their parents can.<br>  <br>  If they are your kids, and if there is no court order stating who can claim who on the taxes then you have the right to take the deduction.  What will happen is, when her return is processed they will flag it as incorrect and recalculate her form based on only one dependent.  She can file an amended return or take you to court to have it fixed but it's basically a done deal now.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Yes, you are entitled to claim the children if you are married and provided the majority of financial support for them.<br>  <br>  What part of "marraige" does she not understand?  When you marry, you file as a married couple (either filing separately or together, you are still married).  It's possible that you would have benefitted more as a couple if she claimed both kids; perhaps that's why she didn't want you to claim one.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Huh? You've been paying CS BEFORE marriage? That's a unique arrangement. Why don't you file jointly? None of this makes any sense.<br>  <br>  You can't both claim the same children. One of you will be denied the exemption. One will likely be charged interest on the amount  owed back to the IRS.<br>  <br>  Good luck being married to someone who's already screwing you financially.|`|H0vicK8Kaa	if you are the mojority financial provider then YOU ahve the right to claim the kids and SHE will be the one 'in trouble' - Be sure you ahve proof of what you are claiming.|`|bSiNAsHJaa	yep.  you will have to pay it back. my friend went through that with her ex and the same thing happened. he had to pay it back...<br>  <br>  sorry.. some girls are just haters...|`|P1KbWHImaa	your own wife screwed you? wow. all ive to say. sorry bud....
1PX69cGIaa	give him blue balls a couple times...that'll teach him|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Just cheat on him with a hot guy! That will teach him! ;)|`|LAbQy9d4aa	Girls can't play with mind, they should use emotions.<br>  We are better at mind games =/|`|w6r4U7duaa	start off by going with the flow, if he says well have lunch, then you go to lunch and he says nothing, you also say nothing, just smile<br>  Whatever you do always smile, and use direct eye contact. Flirt, but dont let him touch you.... play hard to get. it will drive him nuts! on topof that talk to another guy, smiling and laughing all the time, act like theres nothin wrong and watch out for jealous sluts whom will try knock you. best revenge ignore them totally but be nice about it. Cause the guy who likes you will immatate you, and also ignore them <br>  The games over when you give him sex time after time.... boring.... thats when you then have to be strong and walk away accepting you gave in too soon, but you still have one more thing on him! Play hard to get, still smiling lol. It is a big risk to take.<br>  Just dont give in to these types of guys, they dont know who they are, or what they want. They are fun, but no good long term really.<br>  Just dont get hurt and dont hurt anyone|`|PGv2DMiZaa	look if you know how to do it then do it why are you putting all you effort in it
71VRvldJaa	I don't think it means anything.  My sister and I do that all the time.  It's can be a habit, like biting your nails or it can be a comforting thing like when a baby sucks it's thumb.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Sorry Eric! It may be something or it may be nothing! A sign like that it's not good enough! Still, that's no excuse for you to not to go on the offensive! Go and talk to her now!! ;)|`|811ea9ca2ab8061aef7359c396ed9139aa	i play with my hair when i get bored...<br>  but thats just me. :p|`|gCptw4gMaa	She may have been giving you a sign but if she was she may be a bit shy since she didn't look at you while playing with her hair.But like the answer above me said, she could've been bored. Girls are nearly impossible to read.|`|pk9mwqYpaa	:OO i do that wen im Really bored :] Its probobly because shes signing Or shes just bored|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	That is a way of attracting.|`|08ff27fe3110ddd7da36736daaf4c2dfaa	nope|`|xqan4ChSaa	yes|`|fQVM8OHmaa	I honestly don't know.  She may have just been fixing it.|`|mCQx7Co5aa	it's funny of her to stop and start playing with her hair, i bet she likes you and she was trying to flirt with you, maybe you should take a step forward and tell her your feelings?|`|uDleWWlcaa	no i like to play with my hair sometimes.<br>  and alot of my friends do it too. <br>  its what most of us do when we r bored. lol :)|`|hmMb2oMOaa	If she wasn't looking at you, she was just trying to create a distraction and an excuse to NOT look at you.|`|SIWAL8TSaa	it  could be maybe she wanted ur attention she wanted u too look  at her because people can feel when some one is lookin at them|`|vMKEg29kaa	Not really. Probably you are the only one crazy about her!|`|AkCY6rVWaa	Ok so shes playing with her hair, but not looking at you. That could mean two things,<br>  1. Shes simply bored<br>  2. She likes you <br>  <br>  I think its a sign that she is interested but she's not looking at you so it doesn't become obvious, and you said she stopped, which definitely means she wanted you to notice. I think you should just go over and talk to her or do something to let her know for sure that you are interested. You can use her dog as an excuse, for example, tell her that it's cute or something like that.|`|DYWytJCJaa	hmm, just stopped?<br>  that seems kinda random.<br>  maybe something flew into it.<br>  cause just randomly stopping and flipping and playing with your hair is kinda wierd. well i play with my hair alot but not just randomly in the middle of walking and just stopping. maybe she was doing that to flirt with you. you might have a good chance with this girl.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :D|`|YRYyZQoDaa	a person plays with their hair, bites their lip, is a sign of stress or just feeling over whelm at the time.  several things people do to calm themselves down, it could be she likes you, so go over and talk to her.|`|sLSBROqUaa	dont get too excited, she might be a weirdo, or maybe she gets nervous around you because she wants to approach you but she dont know what to say. just stop being a punk and introduce yourself.|`|ntfOcTnWaa	apparently thats a psychological sign that girls want the attention.<br>  <br>  she wants your attention because she likes you.|`|zIma8YWYaa	Yep. That's a sign for sure. I'm a girl, I know. So anyways. That probably means she WANTS you to notice her 'good looks'. So yep. Congrats|`|HjXTkHK5aa	Yes that is a sign that she is so flirting with you.|`|PGv2DMiZaa	well it could be one if you play with you hair and look at someone then it is well if you bord then you know byeeeeeeeeeeeeeee|`|lbEG1WQTaa	maybe she had something in her hair! but next time u c her dont just stand there staring go up and talk to her! thts the best way to c if she likes u! good luck|`|aehDH3Maaa	lol. BULLIED. when i get bored hahaha. unlucky lad|`|NRfqivKPaa	Judging by your avatar you are very good looking lol! SO yes yes yes it is a sign haha!|`|g8DqsThiaa	No, sorry I don't think so. I beleive she was either fixing it or something got into it. But hey you never know, people do weird things sometimes to attract others. Just ask her!|`|dC7nixE6aa	Yup that is a sign!!!She is flirting with you!|`|B5zoRUYWaa	O yea!! thats a sure fire sign because thats what i do!! lmao|`|BnPe68lmaa	Yes it is a sighn. This grl always does it to dis boy she liekks so yea|`|E4BCJkWYaa	YUP!|`|GKUme2asaa	i play with my air alot but not down the street if you know her then it could be a sign and if you dont know her and you see her again walking down the street then go over and talk to her.|`|EhB1Tr3Caa	I think it all depends on the girl.<br>  I do that sometimes when I flirt, but I also do it absentmindedly.<br>  So it all depends.|`|dKhFJwiqaa	Go up to her and be like hey you're dog is so cute, and so are you.Or say to her Nice shoes wanna F***.|`|7Htbfh3Caa	ya thats def. a sign. was she looking up at u from under her eyelashes too? cuz thats a major sign.|`|YtDp0wjdaa	ya its a sign that she was walking her dog and u were staring at her the whole time.  creepy
goY0JHzlaa	You need to get an attorney to help you with this. Most initial consults are free to find out if you can do anything about it. They are your children and you should have a say in where your ex is taking them. If you are being threatened, you will have to prove so. Maybe a restraining order? But, this is complicated and I would seek legal counsel.|`|4HoVVCenaa	yes,  you can but you will have to prove your case that the children are being damaged.|`|yJZeRu5Vaa	i think sooo. and if he doesnt stop bringing your kid there he might just get supervised visitation|`|0HUHHzIQaa	Good luck with that.<br>  You might be able to have a restraining order that she can't come around YOU, but it's unlikely that a judge would go as far as stating that your EX can't bring his children there.<br>  <br>  You can't control what HE does with HIS children on HIS time with them.|`|Eug52iQDaa	It's a restraining order.  Talk with an attorney first, but an attorney isn't required to get one.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	You can try.  Check out the websites.  Search on Grandparents' rights.|`|yUgGedQpaa	you will have to have proof
f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Anything under 15 minutes is a quickie. And just a few minutes??? lol that is called a premature ejaculator.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	i know that my hubby feeds off how i am, if i am super intense...its like 5 mts.  if i'm not super intense...its like 6 mts.|`|215646253ac5e0903ab28bc43e031fd3aa	the question is not how long you can last before you come.<br>  the question is why do men stop after they come.<br>  Keep Going ! Just because you came does not mean you have to stop. With proper training and practice you can just keep going.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	i heard somewhere the average intercoursee a woman likes is 14 minutes. So the "all night long thing" is just a fantasy. In some cases foreplay should last longer than the sex. A lot of girls like to be teased and worked up. But id say just get to know the person you are sleeping with, what to say, what to do, when to...... if you know all those things, then you will be fine.  But if its in the 40 minute range most women will tell you thats really too long.|`|pRF5LLloaa	The average, when intercourse (thrusting) starts, is about 3 minutes.<br>  <br>  if you need to last longer, you need to develop some foreplay techniques that don't involve his parts.|`|xqan4ChSaa	whats sex? i need to ask my friend........*laughs* he tells me that they hug each other and jump up an down|`|6286059824182c4e7ff0e287e5969887aa	first of all don't think. thinking will either make you shrink or premature. And the good amount of time during sex is... you make her *** and then you make her *** as many more times as you can. and you got to eat the puss* first, during and after. Wondering how can you manage during? You just need practice and you really have to love the female organ. if you don't love it like I do for example, you just won't be any good. I don't care if my g/f has her period or not...i will eat it with the most pleasure ALWAYS ! If you love her puss* she will love you. But still please try to last for more than half hour...less than that is just unfair for the woman. Best of luck to you|`|qKpgMkjSaa	I usually focus on her, with foreplay and then sex. I always make sure she gets off before me. Sometimes it doesnt happen but rarely. How long? my average used to be like 10 to 15 min. I practiced self control cause I wanted to last longer, now im about 20 min. you really dont need much more than that (at least my girlfreind doesnt, cause once I get her she'll usually c** again right before I do so its win win for both of us) if so, do it again :)|`|IeeaLYubaa	for longer than 3 min!!|`|V3LUv44Naa	I doesn't matter how long you last as long as the girl is satified first...<br>  Make sure the girl gets hers first if you want a good rep.|`|V6MdE2mDaa	Um...<br>  <br>  not longer than 2 minutes|`|PGv2DMiZaa	dont know why dont you ask one
fb5d7O6Saa	Here are some questions that you can ask. Not exactly in this order. Hopefully this can get you a little more familiar with the type of person he might be. <br>  <br>  1. What does he like to do for fun? <br>  2. Does he have a current interest in anyone?<br>  3. What are his life goals?<br>  4. What are some of his desires(sexual or general)?<br>  5. What type of females is he normally attracted to?<br>  6. What are things that annoy him?<br>  7. What are some of his strengths/weakness?<br>  8. Is he an open or private person?<br>  9. Does he drink/smoke?<br>  10. Is he more of a home body or does he like going out?|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	say, "i'd like to get to know you better, how do i do that"|`|xqan4ChSaa	im dont understand your question|`|jXyYgpFHaa	Tell me what you think about this: ask him about what it was like growing up for him. For example, if you ask what he wanted to be when he was a kid...  it may sound dumb at first, but maybe it could lead into funny stories and even an insight to his personality. let me know what you think...|`|w5ZJqatXaa	say "you seem like a pretty cool person, i was wondering if i can get to no you more" and then the girls gnna say "of course, i'd like that idea to"<br>  Lol|`|PGv2DMiZaa	look just do thing together like going out and you will fing out yourself or ask him about himself

His heirs would include is now wife and all of his children.  He should have a will specifying this.  If he does not have one he should get one.|`|AA10065812	Actually, she could make a claim, and I will give you an example of a similar case in a moment.  <br>  <br>  First, he needs to remain current in his child support, and have life insurance to cover what's owed after his death, otherwise a lien on his estate will take precedence.  He needs an attorney to create a detailed and well crafted Estate Will.  Make sure there are no loopholes, and yes, attorneys will do that to make more work for themselves, later.  I would recommend using an attorney that does both Wills and family law.<br>  <br>  In Springfield (Mo), a police officer, whose wife had passed away from cancer, remarried.  He brought into the marriage two children, and had two more with his second wife.  During the marriage, he left the Springfield police to take a newly created position of Police Chief in an Ozark Community that to switch from County Sheriff patrols to their own police force.<br>  <br>  The marriage didn't last, ending in divorce in 1992.  As usual, she got custody of her children and he was paid child support.  A year after the divorce, the father was shot in a hunting accident, losing a leg in the process.  In his position, this did not create a problem, but when the economy dropped the community decided to return to county protection, resulting in the whole police force being laid off.<br>  <br>  With his missing leg, he was unable to get another job with a police department, and ended up working as a bartender.  He filed for a reduction in child support, but it was denied.  Even with his older children going to live with the grandparents, he was unable to keep up his payments, ending up in jail.  While in jail, he was not allowed to use his artificial leg, which became a problem when a fire broke out.  He burned to death.<br>  <br>  As he had no life insurance, two years after his death, the grandparents were served with a child support enforcement papers.  They were being notified that a lien was being placed on their estate, in the event of their deaths, for any child support their son owed and still accumulating, as death is not a cause for non-payment.  The grandchildren from their first daughter-in-law could not receive any part of their estate until the child support obligation was met.<br>  <br>  So, stay current and make sure his has life insurance to protect you in the event of his death.  Once the children are of age, you and your children can be added to the policy.<br>  <br>  Now, if there are any other issues he's dealing with, such as custody and visitation, go to Dads House in Yahoo Groups.

Then the 1st wife is not legally entitled to anything due to the divorce but the children could possibly lay claim due to being blood related. 2nd wife thur current marriage is legally entitled to whatever he has and current kids would be next in line.

And you WILL know, you won't have to ask strangers...|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Wait and see.  It sounds like you're not ready and if you both aren't, then it won't work.  See how you feel in a year or two.  You're both really young still and have plenty of time to start a family.  You'll know when it's right.  When I first started dating my husband, we had only been going out for a few months and we were talking about marrage.  Well we both starting laughing and were like, no way.  A year later he proposed and we were definately ready.  We were both 22 when we got married and have been married for 6 1/2 yrs and have 2 sons now.|`|2eoAqicdaa	Sounds like he's the right one.. hold out till you are abit older and more settled together<br>  <br>  Me and my fiancé got engaged at 5 months of being together lol and getting married next year <br>  I guess its just a gut feeling you'll know when your ready and have a chat with him. hes already told you that hes being serious so why not :)|`|rlUUaSgqaa	Just talk openly about the future and your plans- your hopes and your doubts for the future.

Just relax and be gratefull he feels that way.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Talk with him and ask him what it is that is making him feel so rushed.  And I can tell you that if you have doubts, than wait.  You see, it takes your heart, your gut, and your mind to all agree when something is right for you.  And if any one of three doesn't agree with the other two, than wait.  When you know it's right, then it's right.  I know it is hard when people bring up how young you are, but you have your whole life ahead of you.  And ask yourself, is your boyfriend feeling insecure or lack self confidence and that is why he is rushing?  And if your boyfriend has your best interests at heart, he will put you and your needs above his own.  That is what love is.  Sacrifice.  And are you ready for that?  Never settle!|`|AFQmwv54aa	Forget him, if you don't think you are ready then just keep it the way it is if you like it that way.

If I had I might still be there.|`|Wd0O06sEaa	I don't think you ever know for sure. You have to follow your heart. If you are this hesitant then take your time & don't rush into anything. 20 &21 is too young to make these decisions. You are not today the person that you will be 5-10 years. That's why so many couples end in divorce.|`|xQnkYyocaa	You will never know if a man is ready for marriage! You get all the signs that he is ready, and then BAM- your wrong. Just be cautious!

You missed your chance, bub.  Try to move on.<br>  <br>  I was in close to your situation about 10 years ago. Quite frankly, I wasn't exactly meeting people at the grocery, church or even the hardware store. LOL.<br>  <br>  I put an ad on the Yahoos personal website.  Since I'm a girl, I expected the men to initiate contact.  To me, it was all a numbers game.  And I decided that my dating strategy was a game called NEXT! If someone didn't pan out, I simply moved on to the next person.  I did not let it effect my ego; we just weren't meant to be.  NEXT!<br>  <br>  I cycled through people quickly. I only looked for people who were within a certain age range and driving distance.  I wasn't going to waste my time.  I would probably have 2 or 3 e-mail contacts going at a time...I couldn't keep track of 10 different people at the same time.  So, within those 2 or 3 contacts, I would probably give one of them my phone number within about 2 or 3 weeks of meeting them online.  Within another week or so after that, we would have our first date.  Unless the guy was a total loser, I would usually be open to a second date.<br>  <br>  If that guy turn into a dating partner, I was on to the next person.  NEXT!<br>  <br>  I had a bunch of one date wonders and some guys I dated for awhile longer. NEXT!<br>  <br>   In all, I was only doing the online dating for about 2 1/2 years start to finish including about 15 months when I dated another man exclusively .  At the end of the 2 1/2 years, I met my husband.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|189233d5651c6d19d5903bb45454ecd9aa	This is a tough one.  On the one hand, I don't want to tell you to stop being a nice guy.  (We need more of you in the world!)<br>  <br>  On the other hand, it sounds like you really need to start having some... you know... "fun."<br>  <br>  So, as a woman, here's my advice.  Don't worry about girls.  Worry about having an awesome, fabulous time.  Go out with your mates, go fishing, go to nightclubs... basically, fill your life with joy, and treat yourself REALLY well.  New haircut, new watch, maybe take yourself on vacation. <br>  <br>  The great thing is, if you do all this, you WILL find a girl.  She may not be perfect, but eventually you'll find the right one.<br>  <br>  If you are depressed and sick of being alone, girls will smell that on you... the same way dogs can smell fear!  It doesn't exactly turn them on.<br>    A guy who is happy and does whatever the hell he wants is VERY attractive.  One day you'll just be hanging around having a laugh, doing what you want to do, and the next thing you know, you'll be surrounded by cool girls. Trust me!  Confidence and happiness are extremely attractive!<br>  <br>  So be nice to yourself, and try to do things that you truly love.  Forget the girls.  They'll come to YOU in the end!<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I wish nice guys didn't finish last, and I truly hope the advice you get here helps you.  All the best!!
xI3T8N6Zaa	If you really like her as a friend, then I don't think you should go out with her. I think this because if you split up, it can make your possible friendship after the split awkward. You sound like you have known her as a friend for a long time too and it's best to not take risks with it. <br>  However, if you really want to go out with her, then it is worth finding out about how many men she has been out with and for how long. It could give you an insight as to how long you think the relationship with her is going to last. You could ask her this yourself if you start up a conversation about people you have been out with in the past. If she has been out with a lot of men in a short period of time, then it shows she gets bored quickly and doesn't like having the same boyfriend for long. If she has had many long term relationships with people then you are more likely to be going out for longer, which makes it worth asking her out.<br>  I think you should only ask her out though if you feel like you couldn't stand being friends with her while she was going out with somebody else, or don't enjoy being friends with her, because you feel like you really want to move on with her. If you decide to as her out, then do it when she is in a good mood, while you are both on your own, so you're both in a good, positive frame of mind and don't feel under-pressure from other people.
gCptw4gMaa	She's insecure so she can't really help the way that she feels. Next time she says that, ask her what she doesn't like about herself and tell her what you don't like about the other girls or yourself. It will show her that everyone is insecure somehow.|`|811ea9ca2ab8061aef7359c396ed9139aa	ughh, one of my friends are like that. everytime she got bored with her boyfriend, she comes up with a excuses to break up with them. like your situation. but thats just her.<br>  <br>  talk to her, ask her why she's thinkin like that. let her know what on your mind.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	She sounds insecure. You either deal with her insecurity, or you drop her. Find someone who is much stronger. Someone who won't stress you out so easy.|`|7fdeTRhPaa	You really should consider dumping your girlfriend or else you're going to have to deal with this for a long time.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Consider not talking with other girls so much?? Everyone just assumes it's her that is insecure but maybe you are giving her reason to be that way. Next time she says there are other girls better than her, tell her there are also other guys who are better than you then ask her if she would prefer one of those guys.  Tell her you love her but this stuff is making you crazy and just because she feels a certain way, it doesn't make it so.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend she read a book called "the four agreements" sorry i don't recall who the author is but it is quite usefull in building confidence and self esteem. She needs to learn how to stop those negative thoughts.|`|ZAz7SEcfaa	Ignore, ignore, ignore. and act unaffected. when she compares herself to others say you don't care. why? the more you talk about it either make you say 'I like you, I like you' 24 7 and makes you seem weak or your telling her she actually has something to worry about. when ever she starts talk about that, interrupt and ask her what time it is? when ask asnwers say 'oh' and on to the next thing to talk about.|`|PGv2DMiZaa	just say why are you so negtive be a bit pround of yourself you loved and that important|`|uBssj3Znaa	tell her that if she doesn't stop with all of her insecurities and jealousy that she will eventually get what she wants and you will leave her. <br>  <br>  Jealousy is such a HUGE turn off

I don't think you will find the answer to your relationship online, you two probably need to see a professional, or at least discuss all these issues with a cool head.  things will probably get intense so do everything you can to not be accusative and keep your cool.  remember, in most cases, both parties have done some things wrong and some things right.  good luck to you|`|dsf5hGGnaa	Only one thing to do....Spy on him!|`|Rf2r23sYaa	It's hard to say if there is cheating.

Especially with his actions and<br>  the way he treats you.|`|G7RCYINQaa	First, this is ayhoo answers. I wouldn't put much into the replies you get. But to answer the question, people get bored of things when they are around them for too long. Is he cheating? He very well could be. You should just ask him. As a male, I like woman to be straight with me. I don't know him, but if i had nothing to hide, I wouldn't be offended by your question. To help your relationship out, you need to do something new. Maybe that can be just going out for a dinner and movie. Maybe you guys need a vacation. Do something that you haven't done in a long time. good luck.|`|JiMG2iYjaa	You missed Oprah with Dr. Newman about "why men cheat".

I saw the second airing on Oprah with Dr. Newman and he had a strong point on why men cheat, but he also has an insight on" why women cheat?" as well.

"I'm not in love with you anymore." <br>  <br>  If you hear these words, a big warning bell should go off. This is one of the most consistent things a cheating spouse will say. Your spouse may have a deep, loving bond with you but, intense feelings of passion can override the bond with you and cause your spouse to loose sight of his/her true feelings. The cheating spouse will develop what I call hormone - induced amnesia. The surging hormones and passion they feel in their new relationship can cause some very skewed thinking.<br>  <br>  2. “We are just friends.”<br>  <br>  This is also another very predictable statement that will come from a cheating spouse. If your spouse is spending more and more time with this new “friend” then there is probably more to it than mere friendship. Your spouse may feel they have a lot in common with this person, that this person understands them and things they are going through. Whatever the reasons for the friendship, it’s a big warning sign and one you should take seriously.<br>  <br>  3. A sudden need for privacy.<br>  <br>  If things the two of you used to share openly suddenly become private pay attention cause something is probably up. He/she may start password protecting computer activity. Cell phone and credit card bills may be hidden. If you ask why or attempt to find out information that used to be common knowledge between the two of you, you will be accused of snooping or trying to control your spouse. Big warning sign!<br>  <br>  4. “I need some space to figure my feelings for you.”<br>  <br>  Men and women who are involved with someone else will request more space, time alone or away from the family. They may say it is due to confusion over their feelings or stress at work. This can be a sign that there is someone else and the spouse is trying to figure out ways to have more freedom.<br>  <br>  5. Regular work habits change.<br>  <br>  Working late, going to work at odd hours or, putting in more time than is normal on work related issues can be indications that a spouse is cheating. <br>  <br>  6. Spending a large amount of time on the computer.<br>  <br>  In today’s world, with modern technology, a person looking for an affair doesn’t even have to leave their home. The ease of internet chat rooms, online dating sites and secret email accounts has caused an alarming increase in emotional affairs.<br>  If your spouse is online more than usual, hanging out in chat rooms and visiting pornographic websites then you have reason to be alarmed.<br>  <br>  <br>  7. Secretive phone calls and more time spent on the phone.<br>  <br>  Emotional affairs occur primarily via the phone, especially cell phones. If you find your spouse hanging up suddenly when you enter the room or erasing the history on the cell phone and becoming defensive when asked about it, then you might want to check your phone records.<br>  <br>  8. Behavior that just doesn’t add up.<br>  <br>  Not being where he/she was expected to be. Missing time they can’t explain. Money that isn’t accounted for. Receipts for things you don't have. Missing clothing. Clothing that does not belong to your family. Being caught in little lies about the details of the day.<br>  <br>  9. Your Own fears and suspicions<br>  <br>  If you find yourself looking for excuses for your spouse's behavior or trying to convince yourself that they would never cheat then that is a warning sign. <br>  <br>  Your intuition is frequently one of the best indicators that something is wrong. <br>  If you suspect your spouse might be cheating on you, do some investigating and then confront him or her with what you've found.<br>   Do it in a way that is calm and courteous. Ask for honesty. Be prepared for lies. It is a sad fact that people having affairs become excellent liars. People who never told a lie before in their lives. <br>  <br>  Trust your gut instinct but get hard, cold proof also.|`|L0Hz227xaa	Oh yeah, there is some cheating going on. Well if your gut is telling you, than there probably is. Usually its right. Signs are all there. You sound unhappy and like things are changing around you. When you try to talk and aask him about it, and he gets mad, than yes he has cheated, if he talks calmy and tries to reassure you there is no reason to worry, then maybe he is innocent,but base don what ur saying, he has lost interested in you, and is not innocent. Look, no sex, coming home late, other woman in email, arguing, travels alot, girl wake up and smell the coffee. You should do some things for yourself. Tell him you have tried to talk to him and now since he is not trying to work on things, you need some time to yourself.

And I want to know why it is that people have to have a video tape of the actual act of cheating before they will believe it.  You need to ask yourself whether you really believe he is cheating or if you are just feeling insecure with yourself and it is making you paranoid.  It is a harsh reality.  And when a man pulls back from having sex with you, that is the writing on the wall.  He has pulled away from you emotionally and sexually.  I feel for you, having been there myself, but girl...have pride and find yourself again.  Love yourself.  Good luck|`|GZn5VNlSaa	Those do sound like bad signs!<br>  Ignoring you, fighting w/ you<br>  Lack of sex<br>  Trying to get in good shape, those point to him trying to impress somebody and it is definitely not you if you hardly see him.<br>  <br>  Maybe during one of your fights you should bring it up. Maybe during his rage he'll cough up the truth!<br>  <br>  It's best that you know, how you find out really doesn't matter at this point.|`|wxggEPLNaa	okay...after reading this i feel as though he is getting alil too ahead of himself...but, i think that to get over it, you have to put your trust in him and go out and have fun with a close friend of yours...and have fun and get it out of your mind...and initiate sex more with him and see how it goes from there...like see if he gets alil more closer after you guys have more fun at night....good luck...btw, always keep an eye open and an eye on him!|`|oPYhUi8baa	From the way you describe you, he probably is. The best thing to do is too confront him about it. No offense, but it sounds as if you have nothing to lose and this might be what can save your marriage or damage it. Hope that helps.<br>  (=|`|G3LpGWXbaa	Trust is a two way street. You have to give him the benifit of the doubt.<br>  BTW- If you only have sex when you initiate it and you want to have sex everyday, then initiate sex everyday.|`|6NgDHZEEaa	This does sound suspicious.

WHY? Who knows. If you are constantly on edge looking for some hint that he is cheating on you your relationship is going to be a constant fight. The things you are noticing could be innocent, or they could mean something. But the only real way to clear the air is to be 100% honest with him. Sit him down and flat out say. Look, I've noticed these things and it makes me worry something is going on. If he says there is nothing going on, than trust him. You really have no reason not too. If you simply explain to him how this is affecting you, maybe it will help.|`|AA11803994	There are a lot of questions I would like to ask but since I can't, I will go on the information given above. Here is some advice from someone who can relate to your situation. <br>  <br>  I will assume that you and your husband married each other because you loved each other. What has happened between the time you were married and now? Have you had children? Does he focus on his career too much? Have you both not worked at keeping your relationship romantic and interesting? When two people get married they go through the honeymoon phase. Everything is wonderful and then after time, the realtionship begins to get, pardon the description, boring. <br>  <br>  Since you cannot really be sure if your husband is cheating I wouldn't focus on that right now. What I would focus on is you. Are you creating a home that he wants to come home to? Are you putting a little lipgloss on before he gets home from work, have you cooked him a delicious dinner with candles recently...maybe greet him at the door with a smile and a hug? <br>  <br>  It is very easy for us women to say...well if he's not going to make the effort, why should I? The fact is...if you really love this man and want this marriage to work, you are going to have to work for it. I have seen tired marriages turn into wonderful marriages because one spouse took the time to make the other spouse feel loved and appreciated. Love is medicine for the soul and I recommend loving on your husband as much as you can and being thoughtful towards him and his needs. The efforts you put forth will not be wasted. You'll be surprised by his reaction and he may be home before 9pm in the evenings if he knows his wonderful wife is there to greet him at the door with a hug and a kiss instead of a mad wife ;) Give him something to come home too!<br>  <br>  If he agrees, I also recommend getting into a Marriage class together...My husband and I took Marriage 101 at our church. It was 6 weeks and we learned so much on how to treat each other lovingly and unselfishly and we learned lots of good tips. <br>  <br>  In regards to his cheating, I would definitely keep my eyes and ears open for anything that looks or sounds like cheating. Even in a great marriage, it is always a good idea to be cautious. You can trust your husband, but just keep your eyes open just as a precaution.|`|AFQmwv54aa	More than likely the reason you can't find the proof is it is not in the house. Does he spend time in the garage, or do you find him offering to go places for you, just so he can get in the car. Who knows that just might be where the phone is. It's either that or he has a lot of control. And as a man I doubut that he has that much control. Let me give you a simple suggestion: PUT A SMALL TAPE RECORDER IN THE CAR ONE OF THOSE THAT HAS THE SOUND STARTER. WHEN HE CALLS HER FROM THE PHONE HE HAS HIDDEN IN THE CAR YOU WILL KNOW FOR SURE THEN.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Hummm......this is a tough one. But, I'm a firm believer that if you suspect something isn't right, then 9 times out of 10, you are right. As others have suggested. I would keep my eyes and ears open. I would be more intune with what he's doing. Now, let me also say this, if he is not doing anything, then you could also push him away by accusing him of something that he is not doing. SO, you need to be very careful in this situation.|`|i6p9dJOSaa	Speaking of trust, I think you need to trust your intuition.  Your post is pretty clear that something is wrong.  Has he mentioned this woman (or a different one?) before?  It sounds to me like he is.  I have some experience here.  He may not have actually slept with her yet.  You need to catch it before he does.  He works 9 AM to 9 PM every day?  Why?  I would spy if I were you.  But you probably need counseling too.  Good luck, and sorry, because I know how hurt you are.|`|pbsasBZJaa	So I am a male who has cheated. Not too long ago I was cheating on my gf. All of the signs that you mention were displayed in my situation.  <br>  BUT that doesn't mean that he IS cheating. There is the possibility of stress from work causing these same things. Before you go any further you must figure out what you want out of the marriage. If you found out that he is cheating are you willing to go on in the marriage and work things out, or is it just over? The way my gf handle the situation with me made a big difference. She "spied" on me to get the facts but when she found the facts she won me back over by her love and forgiveness. It wasn't easy and I still haven't completely got her trust back. But I love her more than ever and proposed to her on Christmas and we are now getting married in July. So, i don't think that anyone can answer whether or not he is cheating on you, though the likelihood is high. But my advice would be that before you go any further, figure out what you want.|`|3wl27GF1aa	Sounds like there may be something to be suspicious of.|`|AA10021991	sounds like he is cheating. but first find out. don't accuse him of cheating without knowing.|`|hhmDxnrDaa	yes it sounds like cheating to me
OkCrlU7Aaa	Ugh you have no idea how negative my parents are. And they also put me down a lot, which makes it worse. But what I do is try to get out of the house as much as possible. Hang out with your friends, on weekends plan sleepovers, not sure how old you are, but if you're at least 16 try and find a job. I just ignore my parents when they get negative and tell myself that it's just how they are and it's their problem and I shouldn't let it get to me. Find positive people to substitute for all the negativity you're surrounded with.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Pretend that you are adopted.|`|HFn8M2KDaa	hehe were just the same^.^ my family is neg too..but i ignore it by drawing, listening to music or going outside to take a long walk without distubances^.^ but if they keep talking **** to you & being neg say," yes mom" "yes dad" whatever y'know? write down your feelings on paper & then bury it^.^it's esy
B2FdoEYAaa	Communication. Tell your husband exactly how you feel and that it is important to you. Then together sit your MIL down and tell her how it is...you guys are doing her a favor and if she continues on, then you have no choice but to leave. That is not a good situation to be in especially with a new one on the way...much luck to you!<br>  <br>  ....if you have already discussed it with him and he will not listen to your concerns and take them seriously then you have a whole nother situation there as well.

So I take it that your husband works all day and you guys pay rent to supplement her fixed income?<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you are in a pickle.  It is her house.  Even though she would have lost it if you didn't come live there, it is her house.  She is family.  In-laws have to poke their noses in everyone's business.

Sorry. But, it's the truth.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	You definitely need to get a place of your own with your husband and children.  You can contact the county that you live in for social worker help for his mother. They can give you options on housing that is available for no or low cost.  Once you have the support of the social worker she can tell you all of the programs they have available to assist people who are unable to care for themselves, or would be homeless without other people's support.  Don't live (and let your children live) in a situation because of worrying about what she is going to do after you leave.|`|PkjZA2o9aa	omg. wow. i'm in the EXACT same boat as you are in. my mother n law is the same way. If she is like my mil then being honest with her want even help. My mil does the same thing, like last week my baby was sick and every 5 mins did you give the baby her meds today, or when she comes home from work and the baby is already in bed, she'll ask did i feed the baby, and wash her. and after i told her yes, i can hear her askin my husband " did she feed the baby and wash her " like im a bad mother or something or i dont know what im doing. i hate it. but thank god my husband just got a new job 3 hours away from here !!! whoo hoo haha, she is completely pissed about it, but it made my day lol .. good luck girl. only thing i can say is get out that house as quick as you can or she will run over you forever. her bills is her own businesss. she should get off her butt and work and make payments on time, its not your husbands problem.|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	Are you so crass with your friends, that you don't want them to speak about things that bother them><br>  <br>  My suggestion, start getting your own alone time, if your not around she can't talk to you. Go to the park with the kids and say your doing something else... or keep HER busy out of the house, there must be errands you can send her on or a place that will watch old people for the afternoon. You could also ask her to watch the kids while you go out.<br>  <br>  Your MIL is just trying to feel useful and apart of the family. You have to realize that she was the care taker and now she has no one to care for. She wants to feel useful and the only way to do that is BUTT IN.|`|giW8ANN7aa	^ Shes right.. She isn't going to butt out until you move out! I know that its a difficult situation but your husband has to realize its effecting you and possibly ur and his relationship. If his mother will lose the house if you 2 leave then maybe looking into an assisted living facility is the best option? Not a nursing home.. Its kind of like a nuring home but not really.. or you might know them as independent living facilities.. Either way its a place she can afford to live with nursing care and sturcture to keep her ocupied, meals cooked for her but with the freedom of coming and going as she needed. They offer different levels of care if she needed that.. In my opinion it sounds like the best idea.. Newly married with a 1yo AND another on the way.. The 2 of you CERTAINLY don't need the added stresses of a "know it all mother in law".. Maybe its just somthing for the 2 of you to discuss and look into.. most insurance companies pay on that as well i beleive. <br>  <br>  We put my grandmother in one when i was 18..  she had already gone from my mother to my aunts and back to my mother haha.. And at 18 i was stuck at home taking care of her.. she didn't need 24hr care but she needed 24hr attention which actually started to effect my going to college and my mother going to work.. it was our last option. My grandmother didn't like it at first but, after a little while she was fine with it.. she actually made friends there and she had the freedom to come and go as she pleased (even though she never did!). <br>  <br>  You and ur husband are tryin to start ur family and ur life together.. don't think of it as "putting her away", because honestly it might be best for her as well... small children running around the house and her paranoia about this "evil" cop.. haha this might be what she needs.. <br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful and encouraging... Its not an easy decision but, something has to change.. God Bless!! and Good Luck!!<br>  <br>  PS: Props for lasting 2 YEARS!! :)|`|zvZnH2rRaa	i'm so sorry it is stressful enough being newly weds, not to mention the stress of raising babies.  lets just say you are a very strong woman lol<br>  <br>  i am truly sorry to tell you this but if she is not quite at their up stairs, then there is prolly nothing that you can do, the only solution i can see is to move out.  as you said your husband isn't open to that idea, but maybe you could move her into an inexpensive apartment and help support her financially.  or maybe a nursing home or something similar.  if she owns her home maybe she could sell it and use that money to help her get the apartment?<br>  <br>  sit down and talk to your husband (again).  really stress what this situation is doing to you, and how the stress has a big affect on your relationship with him.  maybe if he sees that you are that unhappy and that you don't want him to just forget his mom, he will try to find a different solution.  <br>  <br>  does your MIL have any other relatives that could live with her, or that she could live with?<br>  <br>  as for all the "advice" that you get.  just tell her that it is your life, your marriage, your kid, your time, and you will do as you please with it!  go and see you mother and tell her if she doesn't like it well that is just to darn bad.  maybe if she saved some of her money instead of buying expensive supplements she could afford to live on her own lol. <br>  <br>  i know that you prolly wanted a different answer, but that is the only solution that i can see.  i hope you find the answer you wanted, and i wish you all the best.  remember "this too shall pass" lol.

We have always been faithful to each other and always will.  Now that a child is in our life, you see your own life in a different way.  We never cared about traveling or us time b/c we had the us time for many years.  About being financially set, you will never be.  It's all about how much you both want one, b/c it takes two instead of one wanting one.  B/c when you do have a baby you need both parties for the help, support that you both are going to need.

If he is not ready don't rush him. But make sure that its something that you both really want. If you do, make sure that you are ready and prepared to do it alone if he walks out. Basically don't push him into and circumstance he is not ready to deal with. For him, you could argue it out and tell him that there is never really a right time. God gives us kids when he is ready for us to have them. You need to also redirect your focus on something else,live a little and just know in your heart and soul that you are really ready for the long haul. (9-10 months is a long time to carry a baby),staying up late nights or waking up in the middle of the night is not fun. Be Prepared for the whole process.

When he is older his back may hurt sometime but that is how far it goes. You can relax, your baby brother will be okay and live a happy, normal life. <3|`|1UEB5mnyaa	Everyone's spine has curves. These curves produce <br>  <br>  the normal rounding of the shoulder and the sway <br>  <br>  of the lower back. <br>  <br>  A spine with scoliosis has abnormal curves with a rotational <br>  <br>  deformity. This means that the spine turns on its axis like a <br>  <br>  corkscrew. <br>  <br>  Scoliosis is a curvature of the spine which may have its onset in <br>  <br>  infancy but is most frequently seen in adolescence. It is more <br>  <br>  common in females by a 2:1 ratio. However, when curves in excess <br>  <br>  of 30 degrees are evaluated, females are more frequently affected <br>  <br>  by a ration of approximately 8-10:1. <br>  <br>  The cause of the most common form of scoliosis -- idiopathic <br>  <br>  scoliosis -- is unknown, but there are certainly hereditary <br>  <br>  factors that are present. <br>  <br>  Scoliosis causes shoulder, trunk and waistline asymmetry. In mild <br>  <br>  forms, the condition may be barely noticed; whereas in severe <br>  <br>  forms there is significant disfigurement, back pain and postural <br>  <br>  fatigue, and it may be associated with heart failure. Fortunately <br>  <br>  the majority of scoliosis cases need only close follow-up to <br>  <br>  watch for worsening of the curve. Some cases require more <br>  <br>  aggressive treatment which could include surgery.<br>  <br>  Orthopedic surgeons are best qualified to evaluate and treat <br>  <br>  deforming spinal conditions like scoliosis|`|qf0kuMCiaa	Well Don't let a Doctor put this condition on him. If someone says something and we start to believe it. It is said to say it sometimes come to life.  I would just pray for him and don't worry about something until you know for a fact he has it and then you still shouldn't worry. Be strong for him worrying won't change a problem.|`|HWcfmg8Maa	Well, I feel so sorry for you!!! I mean it. I don't think he will die because i don't know what scoliosis is and I really don't give a crap what it is, but I think he will live because you don't see  1-2 year olds dieing often... So I very much do feel really sorry for you a lot!!!! Best of luck to your brother. Trust me i know how hard it feels to lose a loved one....|`|pKzH1cFHaa	I have scoliosis and I live a normal life. It is treatable. Scoliosis is non-normal curving of the spine. Don't stress so much about it.|`|K6fasl6kaa	this simply means curvature of the spine.  it can be anywhere from not serious to potential problems.  the dr only said might, not would.  i guess you overheard this and no one explained.  your mother would be the person to ask about this.  she probably has no idea how this has worried you. if it were explained to her correctly, she should be able to make it clearer and ease your mind.  i hesitate to suggest searching the internet without some direction.  each case is individual and there is too much information to digest.  i know you love your brother and are scared by this, but chances are he will be just fine.  no dying, no wheelchairs.  you need to talk to your parents. i hope all will be well and that this may help in some way.
AA10874773	file joint - or buy a tax program that determines the best filing status for you!|`|AA10873763	You can file Married Filing Separately or Jointly, whichever works out better for you.<br>  It doesn't matter when in the year you got married - you have to run the numbers to see.  A lot will depend on whether your incomes were nearly equal or if one was much larger than the other.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	You'll want to file joint, especially if you have children.

AA10500618	The biggest problem is that he is the cook!!  Whether you call him or not if anything goes bad at any point... well he could spit in your food (or worse)!!<br>  <br>  If he is hot enough go for it... if not then just talk to him and say something like "it's not allowed to date people from work" then start inspecting your food or better yet start packing your own lunch! LOL!<br>  <br>  Good luck, don't get food poisoning!|`|bd54OdkDaa	I say call him if he's cute and went out of his way for you then give him a chance.Talk about anything and don't be afraid to speak to him in front of his friends im pretty sure he needs you to be comfortable around his people.Tomorrow make sure you talk to him and pull him to the side if need to be.Have fun!|`|YW74O9aNaa	what do you mean you know him from a distance and the again you say you met once or twice? kind of confusing !<br>  <br>  hmm... if he sent you a gift on valentines and you have the number , just give a call to thank him for that :) and if he's interested let him make a move.. let him ask you out. Otherwise thank him and forget it all :)|`|I80ozj3kaa	yeah call him but keep the conversion simple|`|w5ZJqatXaa	you should just call him and ask him about himself and maybe you both can learn more about each other. Calling him would be a good idea because you can have more friends at work and that would be a good thing to also have a connection with each other. Although you think he is cute and you like him i dont think you should start a relationship with him as in dating because its not good to date your co-workers because in the end you never know what might happen.

What a great opportunity!<br>  I would totally have fun with this.<br>  <br>  My advice, send him a note, <br>  Age is just a number, honey. <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|wBy6QIElaa	CALLLLLL :D doooo ittttt!!!|`|bS7DN85Qaa	If he doesn't call, he's just not that into you.|`|zr5WwMwVaa	what i think is that you should call him and meet up somewhere like a coffee shop or something and learn all you can, but be careful with your questions, you don't want to scare him of........

It's a little childish but most people I do it to think it's cute and sweet.|`|9oTQpf3daa	say  "as much as you love me"
gXlT2cBkaa	yeah i did  and i was really happy with myself too :S  I was 15 he was 21  and couldn't understand NO  I did make it clear to him I wasn't interested  but in the end i kicked him where it hurt  if only he had listened|`|WWNWtzvDaa	i suppose in self defence i would but i wouldnt just knee a bloke down there for nothing =)|`|l0oDymHYaa	Hi Dear    You got your answer.

WOMENPOWER HURRAY|`|ejSoKvLkaa	what the hell is wrong with you women. You realise that when you knee a man in the privates you can ruin his whole life, he might not be able to have kids. Seriously i dont know how you could cataogrise that as defending yourself. He didnt do anything to deserve that. Sometimes i wonder why men shudent be able to hit women. Because thats assault what you did and that could affect a man for his whole life.    You should be disgusted|`|2XTkSV4daa	Not myself that I remember...but I was walking with my brother and this random guy starting following me and my brother elbowed him hard in the stomach and the guy doubled over...|`|OE8r1VtRaa	I had a boyfriend who used to be violent towards me, one day he attacked me in public (im a fully qualified kickboxer) i was always cared of him for some reason and he''d never let me leave. so when he attacked me outside a pub i kicked the crap out of him, i broke his wrist and his nose.  The way i see it, if they can push you or be violent towards you give it then they should be more than capable of taking it back.  I prob wouldnt have kicked him in the groin though as that can damage a man for life..  You did what you needed to do so i'd say self defense.|`|PhEl5Lyiaa	No but i would like to...x|`|R2mNsqSHaa	hehe good lass :P|`|72UNDrwkaa	You had every right to hit him if he didn't get what no meant i have punched a guy for the same thing and i didn't feel guilty at all, saying sorry doesn't change anything|`|bS8Lzb9caa	he did wrong, and you corrected him.  he apologized later.  if you   were really wrong, he wouldnt have apologized.      if you dont stand for something, you will fall for anything.  stand up for yourself, and people will respect you, and you will like yourself better.    you did the right thing.  dont feel guilty about that.|`|PoVODmciaa	i did, yes it hurts them alot. But sometimes thats the only thing that will make them understand the word 'no'|`|cc80d847170a495a764c6d5cbc7ce1b6aa	I would never kick a guy in the tenders just for the fun of it, of course. But I did knee a guy in his tenders once cause he was literally trying to rape me. =\ Needless to say, he never did that again. To me anyway.|`|TkWf8Ywmaa	Yes!!  Last year i weighed a unhealthy 7stone and a guy called me a "fat slag" so he got quite a few smacks across the face.  If my boyfriend makes a horrible comment or hits me i slap him or kick him in the groin!    They need to realise they were out of line hope you don't feel bad for it! x|`|PyGKLPy7aa	It was a good lesson for him and maybe for you too. Never be afraid of stopping a bully|`|rB8jM04Laa	erm i dont have the balls myself to do something like that , i have never hit anyone and evan if i was drunk i just coulndt, wether thats a bad thing i dont no. if guys are bugging me , i walk away or just shout at them , oops
gK0vcdnDaa	I would not say +1 at all.  Find out the name of the other person and address it to them both.  I was the +1 at a wedding recently and they went out of their way to include my name on the invite, my boyfriend even said that it was more special that way (this was before we were engaged)  Make it personal.<br>  <br>  Make your RSVP clear only have room for one name, or __ of 1 attending -or- do it by phone so that you or the person designated to handle the RSVP can tend to anyone who plans to bring a "date".  I'd say if they have been together longer than six months it is safe to assume they will come as a pair.<br>  <br>  We are handling our RSVPs personally by phone and e-mail, that way we are able to handle all the issues at once without including a lot of extra crap in the invite (registry, children, dates, directions, attire, etc).<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  -Elle|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I agree with Sarah, allowing all single people to bring someone is a very nice courtesy.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	I got the solution<br>  <br>  For those not married: If they haven't been seeing them for a year or more (or a couple living together), not invited.<br>  <br>  If they have, find out their significant others name, and invite them.|`|AA11380378	Etiquette wise, fiance's, spouses and serious long time gf should be included in the invitations. <br>  <br>  Gf and dates are optional, if budget/space permits and if you do not have an issue with a bunch of strangers in your wedding. <br>  <br>  If they are members of the wedding party, it's polite to include "plus guest", even if they are not dating anyone as a courtesy, but it is not an obligation as the rule above still applies.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|l43NSgHyaa	Only serious relationship.   Normally, I would say every single person should have a date, but your wedding is very small.   So, it's understandable to only include those in serious relationships.<br>  <br>  However, make sure you include couples who aren't nessacarily just married or engaged.   If a couple has been dating for 1+ years, then they should get a +1 invite.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Nope. Just address it to them. If they ask  then say "We aren't inviting dates except for people who have been in serious relationships for more than a year" Or something along those lines.<br>  No big deal, very few people allow dates anymore at weddings.|`|AW1dCzH0aa	It is not necessary to send them allow them a +1.  It would be great if you could do that, but if you can't afford it, don't.  It's 5 hours of their life... they should be able to make it through 5 hours without having a date there.  :)|`|VWLtJoX2aa	If you know that they are in a serious relationship you should use their name on the invite as opposed to a +1.  If you want a small wedding them don't send out any invitation with a +1.<br>  <br>  If they are living together then put then together on one invitation.  If you know they are in a relationship but live seperately then send them each their own invitation.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	If the person coming won't know anyone else at the wedding then give them a +1... if the serial daters are all known to each other than they can come alone and sit together.  We only invited the partners of friends in serious relationships to our wedding, the rest of them came stag and hung out with their friends. The only mystery +1's we allowed were for people flying in who didn't have a significant other and weren't friends with other guests.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	For those folks, it is not required.<br>  Etiquette indicates spouses, long-term BF/GF, and fiances should have their "other half" invited.  Otherwise it is considered optional.<br>  <br>  If you know that these friends will know someone else at the wedding, then don't bother with a +1.  If you know that they won't know anyone besides yourself & the groom, then I think you should try to give them a +1 just so they have some company for the entire time.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I only addressed invitations to those that were invited...I think only two of my 200 guests got a +1 invite, and only because I knew that both of them had just broken up with their significant other. I don't think you are required to send a +1. You're the ones paying for the whole thing, and it could end up costing you a lot of money!|`|EKp4Cg0vaa	It doesnt matter really. just be careful of the pictures. You dont want to see the day a good friend of yours wants to burn pics of yours because of his/her mistake.<br>  <br>  Here is how you would address it though<br>  <br>  "and Guest": Address invite to your single friend.He doesn't know who he's bringing.<br>  Outer: Mr. Leonardo DiCaprio<br>  Inner: Mr. DiCaprio and Guest|`|q8eue7CRaa	It's not required, and since you're doing a small wedding, they shouldn't be offended if you don't invite their current boyfriend/girlfriend.|`|562qoBUUaa	It's nice to allow all single friends to bring a date.|`|QFCYfJ0caa	since you are having a small wedding you may want to call the 'professional daters' . I am assuming since you are having a small wedding you are very close to these people and can be honest. Please do not do the rule if you live with the person yes they are invited if not no because how can you validate how iimportantsa mate is to someone. I do not live with my fiance  because i want to wait until after marriage. However My friend had a  wedding of less then 50 people she called the'professional daters'  and it worked out well, i ended up nat bringing my fiance neither because i just hung out with my friends. Now if none of the 'professional daters'  are friends with each other it becomes very akward, as I was invited to a wedding and was told i could not bring a date and i did not know anyone.

hH1lWHL4aa	If this someone is a self-centered person.. Who thinks that the world revolves around him/her.  You wouldn't notice it right away, but time will show you.. Like when you're talking to them about a problem you're facing, they manage to turn the whole things about them, when it's obvious that you need to talk or you need a solution.  That's a major turn-off which eventually leads to me not talking.. Thus the demise of communication in that relationship.. Thus: THE END.|`|YMnTveWuaa	Another woman?

That's what a real friend would do.|`|v2D4Sao5aa	sit with her or call her up and tell her how you feel about her bf bc in friends hip there is nooooo secerts tht waht frienship is alot about....telling the truth even if the truth hurts ok good luck|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	You can keep being her doormat or you can get some dignity and make new friends. Tell her if she insists on blowing you off like this that you won't be there for her when she needs you. Everyone should have a balance of love and friends and she is putting all her eggs in one basket. When they break up she will find herself alone with no one to talk to. Yeah she thinks they will be together forever but it isn't going to happen. Go make friends, and look for the kind of people that do not dump you when something else comes along.|`|CFwAgPFDaa	i have been in this situation before but i was in your best friends position i was the one with the boyfriend. My advice to you is to give her some space but dont ignore her or anything,or go and talk to her about how you feel but dont confront her angry just talk. If you two are as good of friends as you say she will understand. In my case im still with my boyfriend for now over a year and sadly me and her are not friends anymore we were best friends for 2 years.|`|JXeppqfHaa	Well if i were you i would just plan a girls night out for the two of you, as a little reminder of why you guys are friends. Then i would just tell her how you feel. If she is really your bff she will understand. Hope i helped=)|`|Ukw1JUNcaa	This can be difficult because your friend may not know how to best balance her time spent with you and time spent with her boyfriend. For a lot of people, getting a boyfriend will take up a lot of their immediate interest and they may overlook things like how they aren't spending as much time with their friends. Talk to her about it; tell her about this guy's nicknames for you. Be open though and say that you want her relationship to work if she's happy and you want to be there for her, but in order for you to do that she needs to not spend all her time with her boyfriend and hang out with you as well. If he is respectful of her he will have to understand he can't keep her all to himself. If he isn't and refuses to change, that's kind of a red flag in my opinion. Just let her know you're there for her and be open and respectful. When her boyfriend isn't (since you say he's a jerk), she'll realize what a good friend you are. Good luck.
jDOeA6wtaa	think of another way of comunication|`|3y0w1qIBaa	You may find another way of communciation|`|KPXwwwMMaa	you're being a bit lazy. You can find five minutes in your schedule to write your friend at least a short email every week.     When you have time to write longer letters, you can. Otherwise, just make them short and simple.    You can also try texting each other, or calling each other via cell phone when you have the chance.
pIKPFpbiaa	Everything is wrong. Join the circus.|`|Scupj6XVaa	every guy is different.  maybe try dressing up a little or putting a little (dont over do it) make up on....|`|pRTFjaK4aa	no, that's not always the case.|`|MEZ9hoRTaa	Nah skinny girls aren't my thing. I need some curviness, that's a woman right there. I go for intellect and talents over looks, because it shows she has a good character and is thinking outside herself.|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	No. There is nothing wrong with you. At the age you are; most people are just starting to find out about themselves sexually. Boys of that age are very visual. Do not act; dress differently to attract anybody. Be who you are and stay true to yourself. Putting on an act is covering up the inner you and NOBODY (no matter what age) loves a fake. Besides, you're still growing and your body will continue to change. The right guy will notice you and not what you display on the outside. Give yourself time.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	concentrate on studies and wait for the boys to mature. tough!!|`|JkTGq2BJaa	Most of the time the saying "birds of a feather flock together" will hold true. There is probably nothing wrong with you at all. You may just need to widen your social circle. Remember variety is the spice of life you may just need a wider variety of friends. You may want to include some of the people you feel you want to hang out with,( maybe show up at a popular hang out spot) you may need to just dress more like them to get noticed. If they still don't notice you ask yourself 1 question, do you really want these people as friends, they may be more shallow than you know.|`|6wYD6Z7Faa	Guys look for all types of girls ok and no all guys don't like skinny girls.  Matter of fact I don't like skinny girls cause having sex is painful I need some padding some meat/thickness.  You need to get out there and be open minded and have fun the right guy will notice ok.  Good Luck|`|og3Tmn0saa	You sound a bit pretentious, and matter-of-factish.  You probably scare the hell out of guys.  Maybe if you lighten up a bit? You need to laugh a lot. Guys like girls that laugh a lot.
GHZnLiYvaa	A person looses his/her virginity only if he/she has intercourse(sex) with someone. Otherwise, he's a virgin. You can find some information about intercourse here-> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_inte...    You have no reasons to worry. It's just that you need some sex education. Read out some magazines, ask your friends if they have proper knowledge about it or ask your teacher in school or college. Cheer up! Your absolutely fine and a virgin.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	just tell him the truth he will understand i hope ..|`|Hn3aBIb1aa	You ARE DEFINATELY stil a virgin so no need to worry, scratching or masterbation or anything of its type is not Sex therefore you are stil a virgin, you only lose your virginity when you have SEX and been as you have never had a physical relationship with a guy then there is no possible way that you could have lost your virginity so stop worrying everything will be fine. The blood when you scratched probably wasnt even your hymen breaking as the hymen is quite far into your vagina and im assuming the itching was more on the outside. Also not everyones hymen bleeds when it breaks or it may even get broken from sports or vigourous activities such as horseriding or gymnastics.     When i lost my virginity i did not bleed nor do many girls so this is not a sign that you are not a virgin it just means you did not bleed its perfectly normal annd definately does not mean that you are not a virgin. hope this helps.|`|zt1z52Wxaa	I don't think he would mind if you explain. Especially if it's someone you trust and vice versa. You will only loose your virginity after having an intercourse. There are many things that can happen to the hymen. Yours is an example. Others, some athletes tear their hymen while running or something like that. An accident happened to tear it. You used a tampon and tore it by accident. And I'm sure there are many others.    Sometimes, it's even possible for the hymen to stay intact while having sex. It is just more common for the hymen to tear while intercourse. If your husband does not understand this, you should give him an education. All you need to do is calm down. And enjoy life. Just forget about it. Only when he asks, tell him the truth. No point bringing it up unnecessarily and fighting because of that.|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	Thats totally not right, if the blood came out after yr scratching that area they call it a semi hymen and that doesnt mean yr not a virgin, dont worry about that and dont think that way, there is nothing wrong and u will still bleed when u get yr first intercourse and make love.    The other question here for u if u can answer it, Where do u live and why yr parents wants u to get married while yr still a student and 22??    _K_|`|mJbwemH8aa	i think yr not, so live with that...|`|nfacxGq4aa	This is DEF NOT TRUE! Some people are not even born with a hymen! Or some tears theirs without even knowing it.. Believe me you can't lose your verginity by scratching! It sounds like it was irritated, and you prolly just scratched it with your nail or something.. Please don't worry about this, Its so not true! The only way your nonvirgin is by having SEX with a guy... And a guy will be able to tell if you have ver had sex before.. Don't worry about it, you diden't do anything wrong and YES your still a virgin!|`|j106rv2Haa	no you do not lose your virginity... it's the fact that you scratch yourself at this specific part that caused the bleeding , because it was hurt.. you are not the only one that was afraid of that.. i suggest you to buy some medicines whether you get the inflammation.|`|fc4qv3vPaa	sounds like youre very controlled. Theres really no way we can help you other than to be honest with your (future) husband and tell him what really happened. He will either beleive you or what... divorce? i doubt it, so you should probably not worry so much.
zj4HeXEvaa	If you've already got a couple of girls in mind the only way you're going to get with them is to ask them direct. Just decide who you like most and go and ask them out. I know its not easy, but it really is the only way.  If i was you i'd wait til after valentines day, it'll be cheaper.|`|iU8pIf35aa	Go and ask the girl out. Maybe she is waiting a call from you.    Good luck!|`|TBTYCDhVaa	Depends how old you are, if you are over 18 I would say try dating sites, may take a while though. I was on there for nearly 9 months before I found that special someone but if you are just looking for any old girlfriend then that should not be a problem. Otherwise I would just suggest joining clubs and going to events in your local area and see if you find someone that way.    Good luck hope you find what you are looking for. If you want any more advice then just e-mail me.
DJMPQlFDaa	It was the other way around. When I was 18 and pregnant my husband said it was a bad idea for me to go to school and get a degree that a woman a mom was suppose to stay at home and take care of the household. My husband didn't want me to work he wouldn't even bring me to get my license. The thing is I always wanted a career. I felt isolated being a stay at home parent.<br>  <br>  But yes in the event of a divorce I will go after full custody of my kids, right now they are 8 weeks old, 2 years old, and 4 years old and the 8 week old is nursing. My boss allows me to have a 2 hour lunch to come home and nurse my baby. I will go after the house since the down payment was a gift to me from my father.<br>  <br>  He can take any furniture he wants. Most of it was free, given to me by my friends or my father. My children came from my body and I love them and would never be able to stay away from them. I think my husband knew that for me when ever I am broke all I have to do is pick up the phone and call my dad and I will have cash with in the week.|`|bO2rzfISaa	It doesn't matter whether you forced her to stay home, it mattered whether she did.|`|22479221292188a6607f3f3cc2c2b5a1aa	Okay so you are divorced cranky and we get it. You definitely didn't get what you wanted.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Get over yourself already dude. Not every stay at home mother is a money grubbing beeotch! LOL|`|6dd9f8d90259c24d923f08e0666b6bcdaa	I didn't think I got what I wanted at the time, but FREEDOM is worth a lot more than what the divorce cost|`|sMssDP1Xaa	I got divorced which is what I wanted.|`|8PDzaAJcaa	let it go......... no wonder she's done with you
9b46fa1bcd4de3f2eed9af5a9e409c3eaa	fumbly,quick and awkward.embaressed.got it right in the end.still together.|`|p8nDiI3Vaa	I never had sex with a woman to this day at the age of 23 but I remember when I masturbated. It felt so divine and it felt so good that my knees buckled and I almost hit the floor in the shower. Till this day I've never busted a nut that felt even near that good. I can only hope being inside of a woman feels even better.|`|lM6vnhEraa	no|`|wqdA2LWRaa	No nervous at all , any man should be calm and kind to his woman to be able to please her , instead that woman got nervous and scared , man should deal with this to make her enjoy .    It was very good feeling that night|`|hod4jwHkaa	I really hate the one-lines here on some questions...    I found a neat little site who has real people giving real advice about these issues. just post your questions there and see the difference.   have fun.        http://www.GuysTeachGirls. com
DESWKtdgaa	I am that shy guy too, it turns me off, and I am sure it does for girls! You know the answe they don't think your mysterious, just a freak! Mu sympathys brother, if you meet someone you connect with then you won't be shy, if the chemistry is there. I just say in my head 'go for it' sometimes it works sometimes not. Speak clearly and don't mumble that will stop her saying 'what' which makes it worse because then your not sure if she misheard or didn't like what she heard but you have to say it again! Also avoid fashion and politics! Just talk about . . . I will leave that one with you!    As for the awkward silence your on your own!|`|ZfWMnvW7aa	depends on what you doing during that silence, for example when there is that awkward silence do just sit and stare at her, that would prob freak her out. Dont feel pressured to always say somthing interesting or clever, you'll end up appearing boring and stupid. Rather just ask simple questions about her, any general topic. Also what helps for convo is not asking close ended questions, rather ask her something she will have to elaborate on, like if you ask where did you grow up, then ask ask her in response to her question, how was it like growing up there. Once shes done you could always just start talking about where you grew up etc. She'll prob ask you a question in return, just try it !Hope this helps!|`|b7dzGmTHaa	i would be thinking     "god when can i get to my next class!! im so nervous" (if im shy)    "what would be good to talk about next??"     "dude this guy is boring...."    "probably he's to shy, a joke might work!"    that kind of stuff.....hope i helped!! ^^|`|lM6vnhEraa	asasdasd|`|SQyVBEIwaa	I'm not sure. Shy guys can all be so different!    My advice for you is to be confident and friendly, and be happy to get to know her. Ask her plenty of questions about her and don't be afraid to throw in some(but not many!) compliments.|`|EmX453LMaa	No way! My boyfriend is a shy guy and I find it adorable. It takes 2 to have an awkward silence, so don't blame yourself for them.    But because you are so quiet, it might take longer for her to get to know you, so she might not know how she feels about you yet. If she is meeting with you, that's a good sign :)|`|NXA4fJbTaa	i try to think of things to talk about but then my mind just goes all blank so i start freaking out and usually tend to forget to watch where im going and walk into things :|  so dont worry we dont think of how strange you are, we just wish youd say SOMETHING to break the silence.
0OO7G859aa	If he jokes about it and you reject him, then he can say "well why? i was joking anyway"    but if he jokes and you say you like him, chances are the joke will stop being a joke :)|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	It depends on who he is. Does he seem like the person to joke about it? Why not just confront him?|`|X5F7h3l4aa	i think you should tell him how you feel about him.|`|m5aenb6qaa	He likes you but he's not serious yet because he might be afraid of commitment and he might be afraid that the friendship between you and your family will not be the same after you get together (or maybe brake up eventually). as you said, he is smart so he may be thinking in advance.    so take it easy and take it as to how he is taking it like a joke and maybe someday when the right time comes, he will ask you out.|`|M5mXuWLZaa	If your ready for a commitment only you will know. It's hard.  If you like him, then ask some questions about him, see what he's about.|`|rItaulkDaa	He may you never know....you could always ask him about it...they say over half of what is said when you are joking is the truth...|`|j106rv2Haa	i think you should ask him|`|25HBvSxGaa	it sounds like he likes you to be honest.|`|nfacxGq4aa	Well you should be careful, being that your so close he might think of you as a the dreaded F word.. "friend" Just make sure he likes you, if you already know this then go for it!
E7LQp6VRaa	I  like dress 2 and 3...    There is nothing wrong with wanting colour in your wedding gown...  I am having colour in mine as well.. (burnt orange)    You wedding and your gown should be what YOU want and what YOU are comfortable wearing, not anyone else.    Whatever you choose, I am sure you will make a beautiful bride!|`|hYohgOcAaa	HONESTLY   i don't like any of the dresses you have picked out, i understand that you respect the traditional white dresses but still want some color.  The dresses look like they are for prom, a wedding dress should look amazing, u can put flowers (color) in your Bucky or a pretty flower in ur hair but white wedding dresses are awesome and very special in the wedding  because your heaving a country wedding your dress should be long, beautiful and very elegant  here is an ex:  http://photos.precedentproductions.com/h...|`|YgggHhwuaa	I say blend the two traditions and pick  2! I love the color sash. It screams wedding but is unique. The first one is a little too "prom" and the last doesn't incorporate the color.    2 is great! I have seen the same style dress with a light blue sash and it looks amazing!|`|u8xyue3taa	i love the last one!!|`|z2lKqIODaa	It is your wedding, do as you want. I like the second dress.|`|7CKipTZOaa	I'm wearing a lavender dress, I adore it, I think if you are not entirely sure number 2 would be a great choice, traditional with a twist of colour have you checked out the alfed angelo dream in color collection? http://www.alfredangelostores.com/Collec...|`|W58zAH8waa	I totally understand. If I were you I would go wit dress  2 or dress  3. I hope your wedding rocks.|`|sIV2SFFGaa	i love the second one. i think having a splash of color is a great idea! the colored sash is beautiful... maybe have it match whatever your colors are.    and congrats!|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Okay the white virgin thing is a load of crap.  The first bride to wear white was Queen Victoria, everyone thought it was gorgeous and started to copy the idea then the church took it over.  Did you know blue is actually the colour of purity NOT white?    Anyways, I absolutely LOVE coloured dresses.  If you can pull it off.  Try them on (I'm sure you would anyways) but I know some people who had their hearts set on them and ended up not getting one cause it looked aweful when they tried it on.  but I LOVE that first dress. what about something like this as well:  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...  http://i194.photobucket.com/albums/z15/s...    I think that is my personal favourite way of incorporating colour into a wedding gown.    Good luck finding your perfect dress:D
dHDYiHJ8aa	just tell him the truth..    you gotta stand up for yourself and do whats right for you. if you want him to leave you alone and stop annoying you. tell him..    email him back something like the following.    listen. i know you like me. your making it really obvious by sending me heaps of emails. and i dont want to date you. your to far away. or. im in another relationship..    and tell him you dont want him talking to you because he is annoying you. it might sound mean but its the right thing to do. he sholdnt be emailing you so much. he is obviously a weird person. and deserves to be rejected so he can realise what he has done wrong and change it.. or still be a weirdy.    but do whats right!    good luck :)|`|pIKPFpbiaa	Tell him you like to smell farts.
JtEBaOdjaa	Nah you aren't bridezilla, she's trying to steal your thunder.<br>  Don't tell her ANYMORE details.  If she books a reception location tell her yours AFTER she put deposits down. lol.<br>  <br>  As for the church, don't worry. Your wedding will be completely different than h.rs. It'll just happen to be in the same building.<br>  A girl I worked with is actually having hers at the same place her brother did 3 years ago(and yes she checked with him first and he was okay with it). It would've been nice for her to give you this courtesy AT LEAST. Anyways my point: my friend's wedding will be COMPLETELY different from her brother's, just the same 4 walls around them.  Don't worry too much. From the sounds of things she is just getting married for attention cause she was jealous of yours.  She'll get all the attention she wants in 5 years when she's asking people if they know any divorce lawyers.|`|FnskUYpqaa	Yes I would be so annoyed if I were you. Did she already book the church? Because if not then I would say something to her about it. If she has and even if she hasn't then I wouldn't tell her any more of your ideas. If she has booked the church maybe you should even try looking for another one. But 667 mom is right your wedding is second which means that you will get to do things even better. If you decorate it nicer the family might even like it on your day better, who knows.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Change the location without telling her. You are within your rights to be annoyed at her, but to keep peace in the family you need to bite your tongue.<br>  <br>  Keep the rest of the details as quiet as possible, so she can't do any more copy-catting. She sounds like a total attention whore and a bltch.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	Starting right now....All your wedding plans are gonna be kept to yourself. WOW what a pain in the butt!<br>  <br>  That sucks and I feel really really bad for you. Tell her strait up " I think that sucks your picking the church I did because I really want our wedding s to be unique in their own way"<br>  <br>  So sorry and good luck!|`|QenW1Ok7aa	No, you are not justified...<br>  <br>   You don't own the church. If it truly is the BEST church[I mean, you picked it for a reason, right? Because you love it?]then why shouldn't she also see that it's the best church available?<br>  <br>   I understand she's getting on your nerves right now, but you are family, and families should want whats best for each other.So try to be happy that the future aunt to all of your children will be married in as beautiful a place as you will. She's going to be part of your life FOREVER if you have kids :)|`|R6TFrDtxaa	I don't think the family will think"oh just another wedding". Your decorations and flowers will be different, SHHHH don't let any secrets about your wedding decor out to her or anyone else. You can most likely come up with something BETTER after her wedding. You are special. You will be THE BRIDE. Don't worry about it.|`|44Sj3bsZaa	Who CARES?! You are being a bridezilla... your not the only one that is allowed to be happy. Take it as a compliment that she is copying your ideas because they are great. Confront her about your church idea and tell her that it bothers you that she picked the same place and stop telling her all the details.|`|aipChC3haa	You're not wrong AT ALL!<br>  <br>  You should do things w/o her finding out what you are doing.<br>  That's totally stupid if she does that.<br>  You have to make your wedding stand out.<br>  Do a brunch before the actual wedding.<br>  Or have a "wedding weekend" or something, with brunches, golf, sports and a barbeque.<br>  Trust me, that's ALWAYS a winner.<br>  <br>  She's trying to play you up, so don't take her sh1t!|`|61fb89834de2b2aea37292f2afc9ca65aa	Unless the both of you plan to invite 100& of the same guests, no, it will not be another wedding at that church, even to your future shared family. If that were true, all three of my sisters would have had the same reaction when they all married at (horrors!!!) the same church, albeit over 6 months apart. Their wedding plans were all so different, that no one noticed, and members of my family were just happy that we did not need to learn last-minute driving directions to the church.<br>  <br>  Just because you got engaged first does not give you first dibs. Here's another thought; TALK to her, see if the two of you can make the most of it, even help each other out, especially if the only thing the two of you will have will be the same place where you get married. You might surprise yourself and find out that she's not that bad.|`|QFCYfJ0caa	i am going through the same exact  thing. I really do not care because we are all members of the same church. Also all of her guest will not be at my wedding. I do not tell her that much. She even wants to steal our reception hall, i am trying to help her find one of her own. Since we are getting married after her but really i do not care. Most people who know me know i am planner and know she is a last minute person, so she is copying me. I just do not care what their side of the family thinks if they think i copied her. I rather just have everyone getting alone.|`|VaZGN8P9aa	You are completely justified. I would feel the same way too. Actually, my fiance and I have friends who are getting married next month, and another couple getting married in June, and I'm glad that I will be able to see their weddings simply because I don't want ours to be like theirs! <br>  <br>  I would pick a location, or pick colors (or whatever else) without telling her. When she asks if you have chosen anything, just tell her you are still in the planning stages and haven't figured everything out yet and that it is all still up in the air. Or, you can suddenly say that you HATE that church (the one you want to be married at) and that you like all the churches she's looked at. Then when she switches, keep your date. =) lol Don't necessarily know if that would work, but you can always give it a shot!<br>  <br>  I will say, though, that I wouldn't share a whole lot of information about your wedding with her. Just inform your fiance about the situation so that he is aware of it and just make a mutual agreement to not talk about the details of your wedding. That would probably help best. =)<br>  <br>  Good luck, and congrats on getting married!|`|nqINitkmaa	I understand where you are coming from. I would be angry too if she choose the same venue as me. Its important not to make a big deal in front of family about this. You don't want to start off on bad terms. I think the only solution would be to change your venue. Choose a really neat place, and make your wedding over the top, and don't discuss wedding plans with her.<br>  <br>  People will not think oh just another wedding, your decor will be different, and so much more will be different. Here is an idea to make people talk about your wedding after they have left, and it will set you apart from your future sister in law... follow this link.<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqiw-Kqtlr0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqiw-Kqtl...</a> <br>  <br>  This will set your reception apart from theirs, and the guests will love it, you can try to come up with more creative things like that to do to really WOW your guests! Good luck!|`|IQ50BJ0Waa	I'm from a small town that is predominately Catholic so 95% of the weddings I've been to (and I've been to a lot) have been in the same church. Each was different and special for their own reasons.
8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Ah bless you, maybe the law would be better that daddy never left in the first place and then the poor kids would not have to watch mummy heart get broken so many times and be hurt themselves too.......?    Sorry to hear you are going through so much sadness.    I will pray for you x|`|wpi36XBAaa	So wrong. The dad that is dead isn't coming back, no matter what.  And who says that the Dad that is "just gone" was any better a father than the boyfriend? Why is he no longer a part of the kids' lives? If he went by his choice, dragging him back isn't going to make for playing "happy families". And if he makes the Mum miserable, or she him, (and that's why they split) its not going to happen either.  Far better would be for it to be compulsory for parent who chooses a partner who abused their kids to be made to go to mandatory counseling to find out why they make such bad choices in their lives - twice.|`|VlzlPAEwaa	The main law here, should be that the mom doesn't let this a-hole stay long enough to do it too her kids...what kind of life would it be, for the family, if the real daddy doesn't want to be there anyways.. I know what you want, and it would be heaven, if that could take place..but I have seen both sides before, and well, we just do have enough room, in the jails, or in our hearts for this.|`|e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	wishful thinking.  what if its vice versa?|`|XAfzIBjdaa	sorry but you lost me on this one  *** MILDRED IS MY LEADER***|`|21Wk2mu5aa	There is a law about assaulting people.

Then get a restraining order.|`|EENUWAP7aa	Responsibility and assigning blame is the key to this episode and not necessarily law for we have laws right now that burn heavy on abusers of children and wives even if the wife doesn't want to press charges...the State will and she has no say so.

d2359ab4ecd6093abc8a4a670574eaa4aa	It sounds like you two have dated before?<br>  <br>  If you're not dating and he's not interested in you, you should let him go.  It's not a matter of not wanting to or not being able to.  You can do anything if you really put your mind to it.  If you don't move on, you will only hurt yourself.  There are plenty of other guys out there.  You'll find the one who will treat you right, but only if you look for him.|`|ixHwF4apaa	knowing fully about his relationships with so many girls, if you want to continue the guy still further, it is upto you. you have to decide|`|xOX7yMczaa	whoa! i want bill clinton to answer my questions!! lucky!! I think you should try and trust him as much as you can. i know in my last relationship i freaked out abotu dumb things a lot because i didnt trust him either.......if you just cannot trust him then i dont think hes worth it.maybe take a break from him completely and dont talk to him for a little bit then see how things go with him after the break..? i'm sorry you feel this way. it really does suck!|`|sxJgu3C9aa	LOVE is about TRUST, first and almost.<br>  <br>  If this isn't...you should ask your heart if YOU REALLY LOVE HIM !<br>  <br>  Why don't you talk directly to him, this means LOVE, TRUST AND OPEN COMMUNICATION ...?!!!<br>  When you LOVE you should share everything, meaning your thoughts too, with the one you love, not making assumptions.<br>  Living with suspicious mind...damages love, or there is not LOVE there, from the beginning.|`|zxVfTFoEaa	i know how you feel because i'm the same way with my ex. <br>  i live three hours away because i moved away to school and we kept in contact throughout the first semester, but now we barely talk. you just need to be patient, and if it's meant to be it wll happen. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|C9QQPROkaa	If you guys are not dating you cannot expect for him to not see other people. Now if he made a promise or something to prove he could be trusted then thats different so just wait and see how he does.|`|P5PkfDiBaa	its insecurity, hold your jealousy and don`t show it to him, because this shows your not confident. If you act like your not jealous, then it may seem to him that you don`t care, then his insecurity will kick in. That way he`ll be more attentive towards you, then your trust would start to build up|`|dJoE8yedaa	How would you feel if he didn't trust you? Don't have any drama in your life and he'll be begging you to be exclusive.
AG3dYL84aa	Zach, first of all not problems.  You've done the right thing already even though you didn't know it.  You don't need to tell her until dating is off to a good start.  Now that it is, I don't think you need a sit down with her.  I think she will figure it out by herself when the 2 of you start spending a lot of time with her.  If you want to you can just tell her by casually mentioning it in a conversation.  She's going to be angry.  But not with you.  I think it's your girl who might need the help, not you.  Good luck!
nEjeAUmqaa	i have 4 kids and that never changed my sex life in ny way..the only thing is u cant do it when the kids r home or awake..but my husband and i still have it and most of the time it is very exciting as well..as to the few that sex was best while woman is pregnant, well u got that right..it makes a woman hormonal and that is just the ice burg...the one guy said his wife was more hormonal with a boy in side, i was way different it was my girls who did that for me..I didn't get hormonal at all with my son at all but that was a physiological reason..i misscarried 3 times before my son so i was kinda scared to loose him so i stayed away from the sex thing but when i had him things went back to normal and still after 15 yrs with him still have great sex even with 4 kids..So yes you can..|`|HnGAxJ2uaa	sure, just not with the wife|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Even after six kids, hon - even after six!|`|z4byzsGLaa	Yes- you don't have it quit as often as before but I think that it makes it better!!!|`|EENUWAP7aa	You should listen to my wife tell you stories about the sex when she was pregnant.

Especially when carrying a male child and that extra testosterone in her system,  She was insatiable - needed it several times a day, anywhere, anytime, and anyway, would wake me up to get her off, even stopped to have orgasms on the way to the hospital in early labor.      As far as afterward, yes it is fine, although nothing compares to pregnant sex!|`|THWHHHRWaa	oh yeah!|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Most people don't|`|eG53oROJaa	we do have the most amazing sex... we have to work at it and i'm not always in the "mood"  but as soon as i let him start thing up i always get in the mood and it's always worth it.  the sex is mind blowing...|`|pOCabUMvaa	OMG, yes! yes! yes!|`|BItkg1f0aa	oh wow....those are answers i didnt want to see, i just had a baby three months ago, my husband doesnt come home from iraq till august, i hope our sex isnt screwed  :(      ok wait scratch that...1 and a half answers i didnt want to see lol|`|Zjo0ownraa	of course, sex has nothing to do with age. it has everything to do with mind. its all in your hands. you can make it hell or heaven
cc80d847170a495a764c6d5cbc7ce1b6aa	Wow. I've never known a man to complain about it being too loud. He's strange, lol.     Just keep assuring him that it's not fake, and if you could be quiet, you would. Then tell him why should I be quiet unless we could get caught, you make me feel so good that I just go with it, baby. You know, most men would take it a compliment that they make me get so loud.     Or, if you want to be quiet, bite your lip or put your face in the bed or put your face in his shoulder. Though, when you're in the throws of passion and it's amazing, it's hard to be mindful to be quiet. But I don't see why you should have to. If it's good, it's good! Enjoy it! Tell your man to shut up and enjoy it as well! Also, tell him if you were being fake - chances are you wouldn't be so loud. ;)|`|abx5VNsOaa	As Madonna once said,"express yourself".!!|`|WWNWtzvDaa	you could try stuffing socks in your mouth =/ ....|`|MrGaUKIVaa	try kissing and moaning instead. that's what i do with my gf when she gets too loud and instead it adds to the intensity of the sex|`|IQq0wNqQaa	Just put your head in the pillow like I do. If you are in a situation where being loud isn't a good idea, then just keep your face in the pillow, lol.|`|tg9D0tVGaa	put ur head in the pillow/bed  take deeper breaths  put something in ur mouth|`|2TiwAfPvaa	let me come over and stick something in there that will help you out|`|GZfzVRykaa	hell no girl!! keep it up    dont feel embarrassed to express ur sexulality    most women would pay massive money to orgasm like you    hope this help honey|`|0oiAQ4jvaa	Your partner should feel happy and enjoy the sex. If he dont, something must be wrong to him.|`|Okg1QD1Haa	Be loud and proud!
oFUqegjfaa	This is incredibly petty.  If this chick won't speak to you because she dropped the ball and you didn't, she's not worth it as a friend.  Don't worry about this one.  There's nothing you can do because it wasn't your fault. She needs to grow up and get over it.  Next time she should be on her game like you were.|`|fs8wMQLFaa	You shouldn't have done that, sweetie. I'm glad you won't get in trouble and of course your friend will still be your friend! She convinced you and she should have thought of the consequences before doing anything. I don't think you can do anything, right now, but support her. If you have another card, then just say that your friend also left it there, blah blah blah. Good luck, if you need it and I hope everything turns out okay! <br>  Hugs, Smiley!

e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	So there is no harm in knowing her better, c her more often and have some chats, no harm by getting her a nice meaning card on V day and plant a small kiss, the thing is maybe u both need each other and there is nothing here to harm and no problems, sometimes that help both to get really over something else, good luck with her, from what u said she is really cute and nice and worth to try, maybe u both need each other.    _K_
K2QwEM4raa	Sounds like she is interested in you to me and you maybe over your old girlfriend but she may not be yet. So I would keep going to see her but not everyday and just be nice, not pushy. I think she is just taking her time to get to know you. I wouldn't buy her anything yet accept lunch, coke, etc. In a few weeks you can ask her if she would like to go to the park,skating,zoo or out to eat. I'm not much into taking someone to the movies on a first date because you really can't talk and get comfortable together.|`|wjS3GtOYaa	i think she does like you but she doesnt want to be the "rebound". even tho its been two months...    My advice is to listen to her and take it slow, become really good friends.

Is it cruel to put posoinous objects on an animals face that it can eat or absorb into skin and cause serious illness or death?  If you want to make them be nice for an occasion give them a bath (if cat or dog) and put a nice accessory on them, like a new color. My dog used to have nice smelling dog shampoo and a black color with a chain on. But normally she didn't wear a color.|`|k2vvT6glaa	it's stupid and cruel.

af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Tell your parents how you feel. They probably will let you skip it if you don't want to go.|`|bge945ytaa	Honestly, if your whole reason for not wanting to go is because you're upset about not being in the wedding, then you sound quite immature.    Just go.|`|Rr0ph7zTaa	Go! Who knows, you might regret not going and you might miss out on it.|`|8ygky5g4aa	Usually only the bridal party and out of town guests/family are invited to the rehearsal dinner.  If your aunts are hosting it and are paying for it, then it's your decision.  If you do not want to go, then don't.  You will se everyone at the wedding.    If your aunts are not hosting, then you may not be invited so then don't worry about it.    Good luck!
cQiNs0yRaa	mm your boyfriend sounds like he is much too wrapped up in his own view of his sentimental life..  tell him that life is a short journey  it needs to be magical and love is the only thing that can do that  asking if you're  being "too happy"  is just like being too sad  to  people who just don't let themselves enjoy the gifts of love    why is he running scared away from love?  make him see there is too much pain in the world  too much loneliness and fear  and he should cherish all the love he can find    sometimes we are just trying to beat ourselves up  and make ourselves feel horrible out of guilt/shame/you name it  just to feel in control or just because it feels natural  because the life we live can be disrupting our inner peace|`|shvhgzXeaa	He is messing with your feelings.

We were in town. sitting down at the food court, and a bunch of slutty dressers (mini skirts or shorts the size of my undies).. And they said 'aren't they cold? They're not impressing anyone!

You may tell yourself you're happy because of all the other great stuff (wonderful personality, sweet, kind, funny etc) but you will always feel something missing. A great person you love but are not attracted to is a FRIEND, not a sexual partner.    Having said this - it is definitely possible to start finding somebody attractive after you have known them for a while. So I wouldn't advise DATING somebody you don't find attractive - rather, you could spend time with him, hang out as a friend, and get close to him on a platonic level and see if any physical attraction grows from there. This has happened to me twice in my life, and both turned out to be incredibly strong physical relationships because I was already in love by the time I fell for their looks.|`|EGoLQyOtaa	sweet, cute, good personality, good boyfriend and the most important: i love him.|`|DxYwNFdhaa	His personality !!!

RkNIs0rSaa	It is totally normal for your parents to continue to protect you at this age.  Especially when it comes to boys!!!  But as for friends maybe you can convince your dad to take you and some of the girls to the movies or to play some miniature golf and he can see how you guys are together.  Sit down and talk with them CALMLY it is important to be calm otherwise you will sound like you are whining and complaining and that won't get you anywhere.  Whatever you do... don't give them a reason to not let you.  Try harder to get better grades, ask if you can volunteer somewhere like a animal shelter or nursing home.  They will see that you are making good choices and the freedom will come.  I was 16 and flew to Europe with my 18yr old BF and lived there for 3 months in the summer...  Anything is possible!|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	You have a good dad.

All the preschoolers that i know are even aloud to do that.<br>  <br>  And a boy can't come over, now that's pretty harsh. I mean even I'm aloud to have a guy over and my parents can't trust me at all. Their super strict on me too. He just can't come up to my room. <br>  <br>  You should tell him that you think you deserve some more freedom than this, especially being in 8th grade. I am too.<br>  <br>  Listen to kris, she's got some good advice|`|t7YMEcRYaa	It sounds like he is really getting to you. I would suggest talking to someone at your school, a teacher or councilor for advice, they might even be able to bring your parents into the school so you can have a meeting with someone else there to make sure he listens. because i doubt he would listen to you at home. if your a good kid then im sure all your teachers would be more than willing to help. and your dad is most likely to listen to them|`|LC3TGSr3aa	They're being too protective. <br>  The boyfriend part I can understand.

He may have anger issues and it's not safe. - not to scare you- What if he snaps one day? <br>  <br>  And talk to your mom about going to friends houses and stuff when your dad isn't around.

fMEypXDYaa	Each day we wake up and first we thank somebody for being alive, but as time goes on, we have new, different needs, in a relationship, that means that the partner has to change with us, if they don't then there is a distance that grows with each day there is no happiness, that will always cause unhappiness, if after say 27 years, then sometimes that is a sign to move on with life on your own.It can happen as soon as your man and wife or after one of them start taking each other for granted, once the partnership is taken for granted, then it is doomed.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	I think it's similar to when I've chugged a 40oz of Mickey's malt liquor.  <br>  <br>  Although, now that my kids are 8 & 10, I have enjoyed seeing them accomplish things and do interesting stuff.

Trying to convince myself that if I had a busy social life or a high paying job, I would be finally be truly happy.  <br>  <br>  Needless to say, all I was doing was keeping myself so busy that I couldn't sit down long enough to actually realize that i was lonely, unhappy and actually just plain miserable.  Honestly, a few years ago, I could not be alone for even a few minutes.  i would go stir-crazy and have to find something to do....something to occupy myself to keep my mind busy....to keep myself from actually looking at my life and realizing just how unhappy I was.  <br>  <br>  It took losing my job, my boyfriend of 6 yrs dumping (who i lived with) and in turn losing my home all in one day, to make me take a LONG hard look at my life and realize that in my attempt to chase happiness, I didn't pay attention to the things that truly mattered and the things that always did make me happy.  I found my way back to church, I found my true friends.  I found a job that actually made me feel like I had a purpose again and that I don't dread going into work everyday.  <br>  <br>  Yes, life sucks at times.  But seriously, look around you.  Look at the husband who has been by your side for 27 yrs.  Look at the father that has taken care of you and see the man that you saw when you were two again.  Don't look at him with sorrow and sadness.  He is still your daddy......he is still that man that picked you up after you fell off your bike.  Everyone goes through difficult times.  Everyone gets fastballs thrown at them, and most of the time you can't even possibly imagine why all these things are happening to you, but they are.|`|65ojSBXgaa	To be Happy means love, peace, tranquility etc…, Happy means all things that are positive but in this life nothing ever is.  What’s wrong with you is that life harshest blows are headed your way.

Your body is exhausted and tired of dealing with it but be strong “only the strong survives”<br>  Right now your loved ones need you you are very strong and don’t even now it. (amazing) for someone to go through all that and still is standing! You are a great example to many woman out there and you should be happy you made it when others don’t and get lost. Don’t loose your sanity don’t give up life is hard but think happy be happy nothing is easy no relationship is perfect ok. Think of the positives around you! Don’t get stuck on thinking negative.

If your not happy on the inside it won't matter how wonderful anything else on the outside is in your life. You need to find some inner peace. Im not pushing you towards any religion but i would suggest a book, 'Peace is Every Step' by Thich Nat Hahn. It is based in Buddhism and usually available in the chain book stores or your local library. It really helped me at a difficult time. You can find excerpts online to see if its something that would interest you. You have made the first step by realizing your not happy and reaching out to do something about it. If you continue to look you will find peace. Good Luck.|`|NGKwsawdaa	You will be happy when you stop looking at the imperfections in your life and accept things for what they are.

You yourself are not going to be "happy" at this time because you are going through a lot and a sick parent is a very hard time. I wish you the best at this time. Happiness needs to come from within. Not what you have or who you are married to. Happiness is not what you have monetary wise or what you have done with your life. To me, to be happy is to accept the way my life is..go with the flow of it and make the best out of what I have been dealt. Not to look down on everything as an "I wish things were.." situation, but to say I HAVE SO MUCH IN MY LIFE TO BE HAPPY WITH SO I NEED TO ACCEPT WHAT IS REALITY AND LOVE EVERY MINUTE THAT I HAVE WITH THE ONES THAT ARE IN IT.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|U5KIOutnaa	live life enjoy it<br>  smile a lot<br>  crack jokes while talkin learn to stay happy|`|dr8BREXLaa	Peace of mind!

It means that you've decided to look beyond the imperfections.”  <br>  <br>  A lot of people think that to be happy they must have perfect lives.  Perfect marriages, perfect children, perfect jobs, perfect - perfect - perfect.  The problem is that none of that exists.  All marriages have problems that you have to work thru or learn to deal with.  All children are learning and make mistakes.  All jobs have good and bad elements to them.  What the quote above means to me is that you learn to focus on the good parts and live with the bad.  <br>  <br>  Happiness is something that you decide to be and it starts with your basic attitude toward life.  Do you ever stop and look at a flower, tree, bird, etc and think, "Wow, that is so beautiful!"?  Do you play with your husband, kids, pet, etc?  Do you have fun even when doing something that you didn't really want to do?  These are the sort of thing that I believe shows a basic attitude of happiness.  <br>  <br>  Of course when something happens like a loved one getting cancer you are sad about that but you can still have a core of happiness on the inside that helps you get thru tough times like that.  <br>  <br>  I've known several people who always say they'll be happy when... it's always something.  When they move to a different town.  When they get a different job.  When the find a man.  When their kids move out.  You say you aren't happy, sit down and get specific about why you aren't happy.  Are you an I'll be happy when... person?  Otherwise fix what you can control, let go of what you can't control and decide that you will be happy from now on.
QgaMoGjdaa	If they are intrested they are sure to ring or text you asking if you want to meet up.

You ok? x"|`|RoEyFm5yaa	WHY WOULD THEY GIVE YOU THEIR NUMBERS IF THEY DIDN'T WANT YOU TO CALL THEM?|`|dCMi5rjdaa	k, well, if we weren't interested, do you really think we would give you our phone numbers?|`|YgZDXDgFaa	It really depends what you do with the numbers you get.     I gave my number to a guy who i just wanted to be mates with, i thought he was really cool and what not and now we are really good mates.  But then i gave my number to someone i was interested in and i have a date with him.    Both of them have developed differently because of what's become of the 'number'. So what im trying to say, is that the only way to find out is by getting in contact. I think that being casual and cool is a good idea so you don't get embarrased if they're just looking to be mates.

dFE1MVU2aa	So you've only met her online? I would recommend taking a friend with you when you first meet (preferably tough) just in case she does turn out to be some psycho killer, and if it turns out she says who she says she is, then *score* if not, and she turns out to be a fat computer nerd, well the internet is a very hard place to trust.    And I would recommend you see her on webcam, give you more trust that she does exist.    And these days, age seems not important, I have 2 friends that are going out with guys pretty much 10 years older then them. And they're (my friends) are only 18.

Then if you do decide to meet her make sure its during the day and people know where you are and who with, make sure you have her mobile number (and it is hers) and give it to someone who knows where you have gone. Have check in times with a friend so they know you are safe and make sure you arrange to leave at a certain time and stick to it.    Yeah it does sound a little fishy.

LOL !|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Lol.. you are making my day.. and it's only 7.15 a.m in Canada...and I had a great laugh.. thanks for that..    Actually some do and some don't... for example my best friends sister just kept her name and added her husbands name .. the two names hyphonated.. the problem with that is, they now have been married for over 1 year and just had a daughter...the daughter only has the dads last name.. not the long double name.. A husband is also allowed to take his wife's family name.. I remember when I got married that I did want to take my husbands name.. after all I had lived with my boring family name for 25 years and I wanted to take his name.. I was told I could keep my own name.. or hyponate my name with his.. which would have looked totally silly as my last name is of Germanic origin and my husbands name is of Slavic origin.. due to the fact that his father.. was from Serbo Croatia.. but my husband was born and raised in Great Britain...plus my real name is Vera Gabriele really.. and Vera is a Slavic or Russian name.. so people actually rather believe that my surname has always been my family name.. my husband has a British or American first name.. Andrew..so Vera sounds more Slavic than Andrew.. We got married in Germany.. and things may have changed.. I could have kept my name.. added his name to my name.. he could have taken my name.. but they told us.. at that time.. that any children from that marriage would bear the name of the husband.. so of course I chose his name.. and with a hyponated name it's all nice and well.. like with my best friends sister .. but a lot of people don't want to have two long family names to speak.. so often she gets called by her maiden name only..  and they leave out the hyponated part.. that makes her look the odd one out.. her husband and her daughter only go by his name and some people just call her by the first part of her name.. I find that too complicated.. That is the same thing or similar as if you give a child a long hyphonated double name.. what if I loved the name Evangeline-Beatrice... not many would call her Evangeline.. they would call her Evie or Angie or Angeline.. nobody would ever call her Evangeline Beatrice.. that may be ok with a very short name.. to have it hyphonated.. such as Cindy-Ann...people just don't want a mouthful when they say a name..|`|spXPpyP0aa	THEY DONT HAVE TO.

GY6F3UrLaa	Dont worry or get pannic,try to remember when did you had unprotected intercourse first.    If you had unprotected inter course in between 8 days before and after your periods then just relax you are not pregnent.It is very safe to have sex without a condom between 8 days before and after your periods.As the sperms does not reach the overy or your egg cell as the passage is completely blocked with the impure blood before you get your periods after the periods for next 8 days the passage is still block as it takes time to clear so there is no threat of getting pregnent.    Periods might get delay by 6 to 9 days also duse to harmonal changes or due to tensions.  on the 10th day you can check by putting pregnency test strip which is available in any medical trore for which you dont need any letter from the doctore .You your self can check it by putting the prenency strip into your vegina.All the prescription is mention as how to put and check the results for the pregnency.    You can also eat or dring pappaya juse which has lots of heat it it. if atall you are pregnent it will disolve the formation of egg.    last but not the least you can take a tablet to avoide the pregnency which is also available in the medical store.|`|TPKWwRsiaa	MONIKA  YOU MAY TAKE ORAL MEDICINE AVAILABLE IN MEDICAL SHOP.|`|AA11441704	you really need to see a doctor.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Now you know first hand why unprotected sex is a bad idea.

Then please go and get a home pregnancy test.its cheap, easy and 99% correct.  once you did the test, check out for the result.the result may  be negative.but again try it on the 15th or 16th day after you had sex.that would give you a sureshot result.  Don't worry and don't panic.  I WAS ALSO IN THE SAME SITUATION LAST NOVEMBER.I even went to a gynaecologist and got my self checked up, got all the tests done.I wasn,t still sure and finally went to my sister who is herself a gynaecologist.She told me to do the above things and nothing happened.  I would alo like to add that you should start having contraceptive pills if you did not have an I PILL.  Get many home pregnancy kits and test yourself every 15-20 days if you are not sure of yourself.    Best of luck.   Stay calm and don't panic.things will be fine.
xhxnvPczaa	yes because i dont have enough true friends- maybe none|`|pIeKQy0Yaa	yes, because I have no friends and none of my friends ever come over to my house.|`|7dPwXcItaa	No-I have bout 5 or 6  groups of friends. maybe even 7 or 8.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, because many people betrayed my trust.|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	No  I'm a loner by choice.  I have so many friends but when they call i would rather not hang out.  I just like chillen|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	i'm a loner cuz my bf pissed on me, i liked to be with him.. but now i prefer to be alone LIKE HIM... n that's wat pisses him off, he doesnt agree to the fact that i too wanna remain lonely.|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Yes. But it's been like this for so long that I cannot bring myself to believing that I have a place in "normal" society. I think too deeply and none of that is valued. Plus what I have seen so far of it leaves me feeling more empty because it is all just an illusion where people pretend that they care about each other, but they really are doing so out of self-need, self-preservation.|`|URsRqqCcaa	U DONT HAVE TO BE A LONER  THE BEST WAY TO MAKE FRIENDS IS  TO TELL JOKES  IT WORKES
ivUgPdIyaa	By "traditional" I'm assuming you mean "devout Muslim."    The usual understanding is that a Muslim man may marry a non-Muslim woman so long as she's Christian or Jewish. (However the opposite is not true, ie. a Muslim girl may only marry a Muslim man. But that wouldn't apply to this situation.)    This is in theory. It depends on what you mean by "traditional" and just how "traditional" a family you have in mind. In practice I'm think that many families would be proud to have their son marry a fair-skinned Westerner. On the other hand the parents could object for any number of reasons, just as in any other society!    There's one thing you won't come across in this context, and that's racism. It's not like in the West where a white family might object to, say, an Indian daughter-in-law simply because she's Indian. As in most of the Islamic world, religion is usually more important than race. And as I say, Islam basically has no objection to a marriage of this sort.    If you're looking for a general statement then I can tell you this: There is nothing in Turkish culture that automatically rules out a marriage of a young man to a Western woman.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	I think the turkish guy should make his own decision on that one don;'t you think?????|`|HiHQvqodaa	I think you mean "Western", not "white". Conservative families may show some resistance, but most families would be OK with it, as long as they like the girl and they think that she would make a good wife. It really depends on the family.|`|m86H7GRSaa	if they want wats  best for their son, they would.|`|ZjrFsYz5aa	Only a Turkish person would know that.|`|spXPpyP0aa	THEY SHOULD|`|uYusBR6paa	Yes but they would not let their daughter marry a white man.|`|fI0RpOigaa	im one of the balkan turks my cousin's married with an hungarian girl they're going fine so far also his family as conservative as my grand mother :) its not about being white or black mutual trust, feelings, culture etc. are more important than anything but not all parents are same i do not think their parents'll separate you based on your color still it depends where they come from eastern part of turkey could be different
9hHHU6QGaa	well it seems like girls can be picky sometimes and all the guys that are jerks know what women want. its a game to them... the "good guys" are more themselves and arnt as appealing  to women because there usually a bit shy and different. so alot of women are partly at fault for being so closed minded when choosing a guy and being shallow choosing some jerk.   and alot of the "good guys" are actually alone/single wondering why they dont have a girl friend    anyways dont believe me? try dating a really ugly guy lol im sure he wont cheat on you|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Yes but they are all ugly ROFLMAO.|`|I9LTTno2aa	Because there are only a few and they are all taken|`|f55mQq7taa	Ive never cheated... Iv lied a few times... but i was lied back 2... also they dont break up bcus of the thrill of cheating and not getting caught, Its kinda like screwing in ur parents house, only more extreame, like stealing. Well there are good guys out here.. just keep your eyes open 4 us :P|`|R0U4qy6haa	oddly enough men feel the same about women- where are the good ones hiding|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Its really not and I think you know that, its just hard to find an attractive good guy.|`|iKl67l7jaa	I know!!! If your getting a wondering eye then you should just tell your partner. You can't trust anyone these days. There are too many fake people around|`|6b8vuD14aa	You fall for the wrong kind of guy, I guess that's just your type ..  (there's plenty of good guys out there)|`|iDTrTvg4aa	there r very less good guys plz try to understand he is the good or bad  & ask there friends & test him  by sending ur friends to that guy|`|CZVf1AZOaa	well  men are like kids they only grow from the outside. the only time they grow in the inside is when they find a true reason to do so. and that reason is when they find the right person to make them change. after a long relationship they become children again in a way to challange their parteners to help them become a man again. and if that doesn't happen they seek other ways of getting your attention. however sometimes there are girls who need to mature up, but there are people who are just fine with each other, but there are no couples in the world that are perfect for each other.     romeo and julliet do not exist on this world. for true love there have to conciquenses, which you are going through now. So if you do go into a realtionship why don't you be honest and tell your date that you have been cheated before so its hard for you to trust. One thing is that you should stand up for yourself and do things your way because this is the real world not a fantasy.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	We're not all the same.  Some of us take our committments seriously.  Some of us go to work and come straight home to our wives every day.  Some of us tell our wives we love them at least once every day..  We're out here, but it seems to me you're expecting us to screw up before you even know our name.  It's a sort of catch-22.  We're not going to be trustworthy if you don't trust us.
afkygHMgaa	Your choice of words is repulsive, self degrading and makes you look low class.|`|PoVODmciaa	boys probably wouldn't because it would be kinda messy and tad distasteful.  but then again, with all the hormones, it would probably be more "intense" for the girl.|`|Yl4iHHBqaa	no if i was a guy because its kinda of yuckky to most guys would if it was with their wive or something like that|`|PXkuBM2Faa	giggity giggity gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... *pause for breath * OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH... no serisously i dont care|`|22247c23a55dead202cad38509a7aee0aa	billie interesting choice of words. some men prefer not to  have intercourse with  a woman who is menstruating. Other cultures have taboos on this too.    It is something you  would discuss with  your partner before going ahead. some find this a pleasurable time and some women report having less painful bleeding time cramps after sexual congress!!|`|j106rv2Haa	root???|`|X4U36dHzaa	get ready to rumble,it doesnt bother me as long as i know she is clean,yeah go the whole nine yards mate!  yewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	only if i could have a wash after  .it ..ok|`|K2QwEM4raa	Why wouldn't you?
dZxjXHA2aa	Ouch!  It really stinks because you don't know what happened to end the friendship.  It could have even been that he started liking you and then got all weird because guys do that when they're clueless about girls. Or one of his friends may have teased him about you two being a couple and put distance.  Guys are so weird sometimes, there's no reading them!  I would make my name "Missing Old Friends" or "Missing How Things Used To Be" or something like that because if he gets weird, well it could be about ANYONE or ANYTHING...it could even be about like your cousin or your parents or something if you wanted to spin it that way but he should get the idea if he's just seeing it.  If he's MEAN to you to make you cry, I'd pull away and hang with other friends and hope that he begins to mature a bit and then start asking his friends to hang with your group until you all mesh back to friends.  But if you cry because you're no longer friends and he ignores you, you could be a little more aggressive about it.  Next time he says something rude or ignores you, just ask him "Hey, when did we stop being friends?" or "Did I offend you or something? I thought we were cool" and maybe he'll tell you what happened and you can try and fix it or apologize.  And I'd still try and get his group of friends to do something with your group of friends so maybe you can get talking again in a way that's not awkward and not at around the whole school.

Maybe she just doesn't like it, but most likely if you get her to feel good then she will.  Since you've dated 20-30 women I'm gonna assume your experienced, but probably you just haven't found out yet what gets THIS woman off.  Take your time mate, and use your tongue, very lightly - make her want it!<br>  <br>  BTW, try not watching porn for a week to help bring out your inner animal.  Whisper naughty thoughts into her ear at a dinner party when company is over.  Afterward, she'll have been thinking about it and want to rip your pants off.  A glass of wine helps!  Get her off really good once and shes yours.  I've got faith in you and your wife to have a healthy sex life. Good luck :)|`|LzJJn1m7aa	maybe they dont wanna have sex cuz you arent loving enough? women naturally respond to sex when they are feeling loved..are you doing your part for her to do hers??|`|KAoNgzcFaa	Hey pal it was a trick and you know it my wife loved sex while dating now she's a dried up tomato.|`|T272vObnaa	Masochist?|`|JiMG2iYjaa	Do you think was karma?

MEZ9hoRTaa	I personally enjoy laying on the couch against a couple pillows and she sits between my legs and rests her head against my chest but facing the ceiling. In order to kiss she has to reach up and turn her face, this is great because I feel the warmth of her body pressing against me and I have my hands free to caress her body.

GOOD LUCK!   ^  ^|`|JbVyFcJjaa	Thats pretty hard because you already have an established reputation as quiet, but its not impossible!

Also, remember that not everyone will like you. Sometimes you will probably dislike someone for no real reason. Its the same. You can't like everyone and everyone can't like you, no matter how nice you are. So just try to join clubs etc and make yourself known.

The only problem then is he over worked it. and thats why he kept losing it.    I feel bad because my boyfriend doesn't want to use a condom so he doesn't come at all, but it feels like he doesn't enjoy it. I get where your coming from. =)|`|B7nzW4Mcaa	He doesnt know better, i think u need to teach him..|`|ZNqYA6FVaa	it happens to males you need to tell him to take it slow and not to be so nervous tell him it is ok and just make him relax and then he will be fine|`|V3UsTvUsaa	Maybe he was having a bad day and just wasn't in the mood.|`|72UNDrwkaa	He probably came too quick the first couple of times because he had never had sex before and most guy's do there first few times and on the third time he was probably trying that hard not to c*m too early that he couldn't keep himself erect and enjoy the sex as much
rItaulkDaa	They are all jerks, self centered, egotistical, cheaters, liars, abusive, crude, rude, uncouth, smelly, why the list goes on and on...

Its just that when you want to touch into scientific studies that prove such facts answers get reported women tend to get b*tchy, and you look sexist.

kWjy7uzAaa	If you are gunna be a man then be "hard" and leave your lads at home and tune him up by yourself. This guy is acting very immature you can tell your girlfriend left you for a little boy, so that's her loss. Don't fight over women, it makes them fell even more special and big headed. Even though they have no idea it has nothing to do with them we are just establishing our dominance.
KPXwwwMMaa	Well, if you don't want to lose him entirely, you can always mail him letters. I had some friends move away from me when I was in school. I started writing them letters, and some of them continued to write me for several years! We would draw each other pictures, and talk about life. It was great, and I kept those letters for years!    You could try the same thing on email if you younger folks aren't into postal letters. Set up a schedule. Email or chat with each other every sunday evening or something like that. You could also Skype-chat with each other.    It's not the same as being there. You are right. But it is nice to keep communication open. Also, it gives you somewhere to go visit when you get the chance to fly to New Zealand.|`|PyRxe9B2aa	The change in his living place says nothing about the way he feels about you.  I am sure the email will flow and probably time will tell. You will get closer or you will find each other slipping away a little at a time. At some point  you will each go your own way because one or both will find new love interests or you will be together forever. Only time will tell how it is to work out  Sometimes absents makes the heart grow fonder and sometimes out of sight,  out of mind. I wish you the happiness you desire  however it works out.|`|FmBuFsnfaa	dont worry. we can b good friends..
DMpVSHvXaa	Good attitude!    If I like someone, they'll look good to me anyway.    If I dislike someone's attitude, I'll want to punch them in the face.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	I would prefer both(good looks and good attitude) but since we can only choose one. I would take the bad looks with the good attitude. I can't take somebody who is nice looking on the outside but ugly on the inside. I can dress up a person who is ugly on the outside but you can't change somebody who is ugly on the inside, they have to be willing to change.|`|AA10852244	Me i would prefer good looks.      why?

And attitude is not bundled with looks, so I find this question a bit drastic. Thus, I'll find them both in one.|`|jLpAtzS5aa	definitely the good attitude.. as we get older the lasting memory about a person is their attitude - not whether they had supermodel looks... give me an ugly guy with a great attitude any day!!|`|08a48zP9aa	Good Attitude all the way!!

They like you and are trying to get your attention. 2. They are just being nice and it is a compliment.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	They are saying your hot.

All throughout school, I thought all the girls I liked already had boyfriends.  They were all very pretty.  I didn't realize that most guys thought the same thing.  Needless to say I never dated in school and if I knew then what I know now (after our class reunion) I never would have been without a date on the weekends.  I found out that there were a lot of girls who wanted to go out with me only I ignored them.<br>  <br>  You must be really pretty to have had two people tell you that in a week.  You shouldn't have any problem finding a date any night of the week you want.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|gC7OMToraa	They mean that you're really hot/pretty and they can't believe you don't have to fight boys off :) aka that you don't have a boyfriend.|`|fF9uTSmpaa	because they probably are interested in yu and think yur cute and they cant believe that someone as cute as yu (in there sense) doesnt have a bf. its rele that simple|`|35c3df911f84beff6b1fc6dff3df6190aa	They obviously like you|`|scnW0Wzeaa	They are checking you out to se if they have a chance with you .|`|rV8aWISGaa	they are wondering why a pretty girl like you does not have a boyfriend already|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	They want to go out with U|`|TiOsIfi7aa	it means ur hottt and they want to go out wt u|`|1acc6a03dc8acb93ccd9b56b409139d2aa	they probably are attracted to you and want to date you.. isnt it obvious lol? <br>  <br>  just because two guys say that doesnt mean the whole male population thinks your hot lol.. some peopel are just drawn to certain people.. you probably are a "really cool girl to chill with" so there saying that in reference to that.. as in "who wouldnt want to date a girl like you, you have an amzing personality" .

You have looks and personality. So they are surprised that no one has snatched you up because you are so obviously great. Its like when us girls see a hot guy with a great personality, we assume to ourselves that they have a gf or are gay, because they seem to good to be single.|`|QCF9nHDLaa	It means that they are a little uncomfortable with asking you out because they know that you don't want to see anyone right now.It also means that they really like you and their trying to give you a hint for you to figure it out.And it could also mean that they respect you enough to not to go ahead and ask you out.|`|GKGQQaObaa	Yeah I would say if they are surprised that you don't have a boyfriend then that means your cute. Like some of the other people said they mights want to ask you out or maybe not, but generally it just means they think your cute and are surprised no ones asked you out.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I would think that would mean that whoever said that to you thinks you are definetly girlfriend material. He can't believe someone hasn't snatched you up yet! That's a compliment!|`|AA11346438	they share the common false belief that all cute nice girls already have boyfriends and it's hopeless for them. you're shattering their belief system.|`|Vcm0rnWjaa	they mean that you are really pretty and they probably like you and you are probably great person aswell|`|yEHdJwVGaa	that means u have a good personality or a good looking|`|vkPlX2Y4aa	You're a hottie and they're nervous about asking you out. Plain and simple.|`|P8n8QNoTaa	it means your hot and you should have a boyfriend because hot girls usually have one and they prob want to be yours|`|s43R1jUiaa	Thats what they mean, they both are wondering why a pretty girl like you isn't with someone|`|93CVX6Jwaa	they want you|`|l5uVtefLaa	they just guese a really cute girl has a boyfriend if u dont they get surprised|`|Wo4Gxtduaa	we are trying to complement you the best way as possible. for being a guy its very hard to tal k to a gril every second that we are chating or next to a beatifull girl we feel intimidated. so we tend to say things out of the ordinary. its very hard in our cases to impress a girl. we are like a child to a parent. all we want is our mother to appreciate the grades we give them so we want love in return. thi is the best example i can give you. i have been giving adivce to my close ones for about 7 years. and i havent been wrong since

your find someone better who will treat you like a princess and you love him and then think back about your ex and be like " what did i see in him that wasn't true love"   just keep yourself busy go out with mates don't let him see you upset!

You should ideally cut all contact with him, but then again I thinkt he reason why his new 'pal' is acting the way she does is that she sees you as a threat and wants you to go away or feel intimidated so that she can snag him. So gather up some courage find him when he's alone or resonably alone and just go up to him and ask, do you want me or not? is he says no then say fine thats all I wanted to know, if he says yes then say so why are you acting this way and if says I dont know then he is more than likely trying to take you on for a ride so just laugh and walk away (it will hurt his pride/ego) unless of course you think he is being earnest. If you can't gather courage start to ignore him and this new girl, if you hear people making comments and they know you can hear just laugh at them, they will honestly begin to think that its a joke and its not getting to you. The stronger you appear the more people will avoid hurting you.  But my opinion is from reading what you're saying, you're concerned about him, you're jealous of this girl, just as she is of you and you both feel threatned by each other. But he needs to step up and take responsibility, but if he doesn't then just walk away because it seems like you're going to get hurt. If he loves you back he will run after you. Simple as.

I will not bad mouth you for your age ever, but you are still way too young to be all crazy for one guy.... you shouldn't be. You should be meeting as many people as possible and involve yourself in activities that are fun and good for you at school........ college clubs, fund raisers, volunteering, helping other, working out, improving your self image... personally and physically... once you start to see how beautiful YOU REALLY ARE.. then you will see that other people think so as well. Then you will smile and see that there is a bigger world than the one you thought you were in.... I give you this advice because it worked for me. I used to be in love with a girl who didn't care as much for me if at all............ she broke it off and the very next day she was with some dude...................... some next guy... I was shocked... I wanted her back and made things worse.... i wrote her, emailed, text, left messages, etc... The only time she came looking for me was when she needed the assurance that I still wanted her... when she got her FIX of this, she would disappear from me again........  guess what... only in loneliness and solitude, do we find how wonderful we really are and how beautiful others think we are as well............. some times we are blind to other people.........but if we open our eyes we would see that there is more fish in the sea and that we are in their dreams ... that we are not alone... so when I worked out and rode my bike and jogged and drank like 10 bottles of water and drank juiced mix drinks from the juice bar and I started to glow... the uglier she seemed and now she is not unimportant, but I am not after her... she looked for me a few times and I said that I would get back to her and never did....     Moral of the story, involve yourself with other people and do nice things for others and work in yourself and your mind will expand and grow with experience...       . best of luck to you and I hope this helps........ kindly let me know...

Not being rude, but you need to respect and value yourself before they will respect or value you.  If you want love, he's not interested. And no guys like this will be. Love isn't saying 'I love you' or sex, or a feeling of attraction. Proper fulfilling love is patient, kind, it does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.  Love is commitment. Sure, attraction comes in there too, as does sex, eventually. But if you want a guy who values you, you need to put away the sex, the willingness to give yourself away. Because they're things which just attract boys who just want those things, nothing more. A guy who really cares will love you for who you are, without needing sex, or any of that.|`|PrpLmZoRaa	alright, so here's what you do....try to forget about him because obviously he's an ******, and he's making you feel miserable (so that ain't love)....try to find a new boyfriend and just forget his sorry @ss....he's a prick, a jack@ss, he doesn't deserve your attention and love|`|1dfd90ec99e7ca43256c4d9f2f92f46caa	hmm seems like hes a bit of a player, and hes been using you !    try and ignore his pathetic comments, its shows hes an insecure loser nd he'll soon grown out of it. also, dont let him get to u because soon ur gna be off to uni with a hole new world and you'll find some1 right for you    not a moron like him, it may be hard but your gna have to try and move on    hes a player, and hes good at his game  hmph  gd luck :)      xxxxxxxx|`|AA11089526	Ok, now your being childish.....Stop worrying with this and spending so much time on him or these thoughts.....kick him to the curb....you deserve to be treated like a lady that you are and respected as such....who cares what he does or says.....drop him like a dynamite stick.    GOOD LUCK.......your endorphins spot in your brain needs you to get over this...|`|Jnz7yiZtaa	most guys are the same.   dont begin "hating your life" cuz of him. life is beautiful no matter what. things like this happen all the time, & you just have to accept it and stay strong. pain is like a puzzle piece. what makes life beautiful.  honestly, he is stupid. DO NOT FALL FOR ANYMORE GUYS THAT INSIST ON HAVING SEX SOON OR TRY TOUCHING YOU.|`|1RnWLGnmaa	your too attatched to this guy, forget him!    theres no reason to want to end your life, everyone has really hard things to deal with in life, some is when their whole families are killed, others their lives may have been struck by a disaster, and honestly, compare your situation to theirs, it seems kind of wimpy compared, right?    are you really going to let a GUY make you want to end your life?!!!!  you only get one shot at this life, don't give it away because of something as small as a relationship! things may seem horrible and or unbearable now, but in the future time will heal your emotional wounds, but how can life do that for you if you've ended it! you could grow up and become pretty much anything you want to become, and when your older you'll look back and think "oh my god, i can't believe i considered ENDING MY LIFE for some guy that i barely remember the name of now!!"       so even though i know its hard, and you may be suffering depression (?) don't ever let this boy control literally whether you live or die, clearly he needs some serious growing up to do aswell!        BE POSITIVE!!!      hope i helped!    :D|`|EtOdOTmyaa	Just calm down.  Everyone, normal people have thoughts like this all the time!   Don't worry about boys, thats the least thing that you need to worry about.  I've wanted to kill myself too, I felt like I couldn't take the pressure, that there was too much to worry over, nobody cared and all that crap.  But people DO care, you need to understand that much.   I'm can't even drive yet and I've delt with several suicides and self mutilation problems and eating disorders and everything else you can think of.   Most of it was over problems that could have easily been solved.  Problems with boys, parents, money issues, etc.   Don't even tell yourself that you even wanna think bout suicide.  That's where it all starts.      Boy Issue Part:  Guys are butt holes.  As they get older, the ones who you should consider going with get a lot more mature.  Love is the strongest feeling, even tho some ppl claim to not feel it, they do.  It's something you can't ignore and not many people know why.  It's just how we're made.  If you really love him then just let him know you're there.  If he loves you back, and is just trying to make you jealous, he'll realize that he NEEDS you.  Start going out with other guys, that will really make him know who he needs.  Don't beat yourself up and rip open wounds that are trying to heal.  Thats another big part to suicide.      I know it may not have been on topic...at all.  But I really don't care.  IT was help on boys and suicide and it seemed like that was what you needed.  Always remember tho, someone loves you no matter what you think.

dZxjXHA2aa	Even though you're going to feel like mush inside try to start acting really "whatever" when you're around him.  When you come in and sit down at math just say "Hey" really casually, if someone says or does something funny in class look him and laugh, if the teacher says something weird, look at him and roll your eyes and smile.  He'll start responding and soon you will be both saying Hi when you see eachother at school and become math class friends that chat before class.  If you can get to that comfort level with him you'll be able to be like "Hey we should hang out sometime" and get him to ask you out to a movie or to the mall or something.|`|a1b7e7748fe864b4bfe2e265ef2514c6aa	Relax and just say simple things like - hello - after a few hello occasions  - add perhaps we could sit near each other - then later say I am having my lunch at ... would you like to sit with me and so on - simple steps leading to friendships and maybe later relationship - ha a bit of poetry here -try it and see what happens   Good luck
AG3dYL84aa	I think the answer is tickets to his favorite sports team.  Tell him you don't want to go.  The thing is to figure out which guys he will want to come with him and make sure you get enough tickets.

QjIhIFnPaa	honesty as they say is the best policy.    And with guys, hinting doesn't work, they don't get them.    You have to be straight out with men.    Your best bet is to find a time when you are both alone and say it casually.  Tell him that you don't want it to ruin your friendship, but you couldn't hold it in.    And you know that if you never say anything you will never find out what may have happened if you did!    So go for it girl    I wish you all the luck =]|`|og3Tmn0saa	I think you need to worry less about ruining your friendship and more about what kind of lost opportunity he is.

cdQryr7paa	I have never cheated, but I have come close.<br>  Temptation is a MFer.<br>  But in the end, I was able to control myself and tell the other woman it wasn't going to happen.<br>  All I had to do was think about everything I was risking for one night of indulgence.<br>  Why I almost did? <br>  I guess it had been a long time since a woman showed me the attention and flirted with me in that way. <br>  It's easy to get settled into a marriage and take each other for granted.<br>  My father cheated on my mother and they divorced, breaking up our family when I was a kid.<br>  That's a good deterant for me.|`|IFd94XDkaa	After we had been married 12 years my husband cheated, he spent one night with a woman he'd met at a bar while he was out of town working.  He confessed to me a couple of weeks later.  He felt terrible about it and begged me not to leave him.  He was devastated when I moved in with a friend. <br>  <br>  I stayed with my friend for a couple weeks while I thought about it and made a decision on what to do.  All my friends were telling me that I should divorce him but after I had calmed down and was able to think rationally I decided that I wasn't willing to throw away 12 years of my life on one stupid mistake.  After all, I'm not perfect and I expect him to forgive me when I do stupid things - I've never cheated on him but still, I've made mistakes believe me.  <br>  <br>  This June will be our 24th Anniversary.  We're very happy together.  I think the reasons we made it thru are that we talked about it and then put it behind us.  I didn't obsess about it.  I never threw it in his face when we were arguing about something else.  I've seen other women say they forgave their husband but then they never quit thinking about it, they never quit bringing it up.  I think part of forgiveness is letting it go.  I watched him pretty close for about a year but I trust him completely.  I feel honored to be his wife.  He's a wonderful man and forgiving him was the smartest thing I ever did.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Wife cheated and I divorced her.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	She cheated, I divorced her.

We both have forgiven and looked past it to the root cause of what happened and now we are in love and doing great and would never dream of hurting the other like that again.<br>  The secret was to put God first, open up communication and remember why we fell in love and are together in the first place.<br>  You have to want to make it work and honestly be willing to move past your own, and the other's indiscretions...|`|Kg5KX432aa	I cheated on my husband when he was out at the bars every night because I felt alone and met a guy that adored me and gave me all the time in the world. My husband found out, but wanted to work it out because I felt awful and cut the other man completely out of my life. <br>  then my husband cheated on me. We separated, but he came crawling back begging for forgiveness. I took him back but with the stipulation that we would no longer have alcohol in our marriage. <br>  Our marriage is amazing now. We're stronger than ever, but it is still a continual fight to trust eachother and keep working on the marriage|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	My ex and i didn't cheat on each other.

Ukw1JUNcaa	I don't think either of you should "step up" until you know for sure that he is interested, and if he is, she should tell him. If he tries to make a move on her this weekend, she needs to simply tell him "Hey, I'm sorry if you got the wrong idea or something, but I really only like you as a friend." If you were the one to confront him, it might cause tension for you both with him as a friend and in your band. He also might get a bad attitude of "well she didn't tell me not to" and think it's okay to approach her when you aren't around." If she wants to just be friends with him (if he really is interested), she should tell him.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I don't think that anyone should say anything to each other just yet because neither one of you really know how he feels or if he even likes her. If he is starting to show a major interest in her then she should probably address it only if he talks about how he feels with her. Don't get your self involved because it isn't really your place.|`|HjXTkHK5aa	She should be the one because the drummer boy is having a relationship with her not you.|`|lSGNCKitaa	Don't confrot anyything without knowing for sure from the source. if he tells her he likes her, or makes a move on her.. then SHE should set things straight with him, she should be like "woah, i don't like you that way.." & if he doesnt stop then you should come in.
fTVU0sP1aa	I dont think a five year age gap would be the cause of your problem.  And if you are intimidated to him, why would you get involve with him in the first place?  Is it really him that's making you feel that way, or is it because of you and your own insecurities? Life is too short to feel bad all the time. The difference in age should be no hindrance to a good and satisfying relationship. Ask yourself why you feel "so inferior" to him. If it's because of you and your past experiences with men, you can take measures to boost your confidence and self-esteem, especially if you still love your boyfriend. If it's because of him, it's better to re-start thinking what is most important in your life, and you should always safeguard your own peace of mind and move on.|`|Cf8GBWTkaa	According to marriage research... the most successful of all marriages (long term marriages) are the ones where the male is around 5 years older than the wife.  It is even more successful than women 5 years older than their husbands.     If you are intimidated by the most successful of all age combinations, I'd hate to see how you are with the most failed age combinations like 40F 23m etc.      You didnt mention your age though. If you are a kid, I can understand your feelings. But if you are an adult, you are crazy to be intimidated by that. Thats the best possible hook up in terms of long term marriage.|`|haCssg2Laa	of course its not    are you clutching at straws, for a reason  rather than facing up to what you REALLY already know??    my OH is 10 years older than me  the age gap is NEVER apparent  if anything I appear the "grown up" at times, LOL    if you feel intimidated by him, its because he IS intimidating  and that is NO basis for a relationship    you have to assess WHY you feel this way  and either sort through this with him, or leave  you CANNOT & SHOULD NOT live life feeling intimidated    its your choice how you feel  not someone elses|`|4qL7oRrVaa	You probably can't get over the fact that he's older that makes you feel intimidated - if you didn't care that he's older you wouldn't be intimidated.
KSK22vHUaa	I agree with ouragon.  Anything your daughter tells the MIL will be used against her.  I have a very similar step-mother.  Advise your girl to change the wedding date and not tell the MIL.  Have someone else (a trusted cousin?  a friend?) invite the MIL shopping, and then brought to the courthouse if her presence is really wanted.  After this, it might not be.<br>  <br>  And this grandmother's time with the child should be limited if she's that immature about things.  She'll just teach the little one to pout and b*tch until she gets her way (which is what she's trying to do by threatening not to come to the wedding).|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Both your soon to be SIL and your daughter need to tell her directly - <br>  <br>  "If you do not rescind the invitations to the people you invited ubeknowst to us we will change the wedding date and you will not be invited nor will you be privy to any of the details.  It's our wedding and our choice as to whom we invite."<br>  <br>  See what she does...be prepared to follow through.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Ignore those first two answers! Some people! <br>  I think that you do need to respect you daughters wishes and try to stay out of it, but the only way they will not have what the MIL has planned is by cancelling and going ahead with rescheduling for Monday :( It will mean the MIL prob wont show, but if she doesnt it just goes to show how selfish she really is.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Your daughter should change the wedding date to Tuesday, or whatever day she can get off work, and not tell ANYONE.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Simple: Send her away on a Spa-Cruise!<br>  It's easy. Call her and tell her (disguise your voice or use a friend to do it) that she's just won a weekend trip to Scenic (you name someplace about 300 miles from where the wedding wil be,)<br>  to make it sound official, give her phoney confirm numbers and such.|`|FzFSzilmaa	their wedding, they should deal with the problems... it isn't your place to take over...|`|bO2rzfISaa	If the MIL is a nut there's no way she should have her babysit.<br>  <br>  You daughter would be making a smart move to get married without telling anyone.<br>  <br>  Your daughter needs to never tell the MIL anything, ever.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Sorry but your future son in law really needs to cut the apron strings NOW and tell him mother where to put it.  If she un-invites everyone and also herself, then she's being a drama queen, and will only make herself look bad.  <br>  <br>  Sorry for your daughter.  Tell her to just go along as planned, but stand her ground with MIL before things get WAY out of control (more than they already are).  Give your daughter and her fiance as much emotional backing as you can muster.  <br>  <br>  So what does your daughter going to work have to do with all of this?  If she canceled tomorrow, than it's HER fault for letting her mother in law get to her.  She should really get her date back and stick with the original plan.  If a bunch of uninvited guests show up, they should just be asked to leave, with the mother in law's apologies for overstepping her boundaries.  Put it right back into the old battle axe's lap right where it belongs.
4POGapREaa	No.  I went through a huge rockstar phase where I only dated super hot & intriguing guys.  They're all a bunch of losers now who never made it anyway.  My attraction to hotness faded after years of being with crappy self absorbed men that were pretty only on the outside.  I fell in love with my husband before I even met him in person, as strange as that sounds.  I just wanted normality & a deeper connection & I got it.  The physical aspect took a total backseat the more I lived & learned.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	Yup, she is the best.Physically and spiritually.Looks are superficial, spirit and personality are real.|`|FoDGuLemaa	this should be best answer<br>  "About 99% of the English speaking world, when they hear "the best you've ever had" refer it to satisfying intense pleasant intercourse.<br>  <br>  Learn to phrase your questions better."<br>  AHAHAHHAAHHA|`|asxqampCaa	About 99% of the English speaking world, when they hear "the best you've ever had" refer it to satisfying intense pleasant intercourse.<br>  <br>  Learn to phrase your questions better.|`|DvnOIx1laa	Yes!

I hadn't seen her in a long time and I was in town for a business trip so I asked her to meet me for dinner and we could catch up.  Turns out she was modeling and she was such a knockout I almost could not concentrate on eating.  I had to recheck my DNA that I was related to her.|`|79wOWoM0aa	Honestly, no... but that's fine.

Some of the hottest women I've been with have been boring in bed, like they think their looks are all they need to bring to the table. <br>  <br>  I can only think of one truly HOT woman who was also dynamite in bed.  YOWZA.|`|jDT8yH7Raa	my husband is fine as hell and knows how to satisfy me in the sack.  he also treats the best out of all the other guys i had, so i guess he is the best!|`|AA11460234	I've never given that any thought as physical is a state of mind. Its the personality that matters. Can I live with you in harmony?<br>  <br>  That's the key to everything.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	I think so, yes. My hubs is my best friend not just my life partner, father to my kids and my lover. it's a package deal for me.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	No, some woman I ended up meeting at a donut shop before I was married. She was an aerobics instructor. I ended it a month later because she was bipolar. She was very sexy. But my wife is more beautiful.|`|88bDvyiwaa	Hell no.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Yes he is.

You have family and friends who all need to see you. Tell her that you dont want to get caught up in the middle where everyone is pulling at you, because you will end up resenting it. You both appear young, and on her part, it is natural to want to be with you 24/7. But realistically, thats not possible. If you dont see her today, then when you do see her, make an effort with her and be exclusively hers (ie turn your phone off and dont txt friends ---- too much). That way, when you ware with her, she gets your full attention.|`|PoVODmciaa	no its normal. most people get really annoyed if they spend every waking moment with their girlfriend/boyfriend.
GaVKozTJaa	When they made the alphabet they should have put U and I together.         How was heaven when you left.         Is your dad an alien because their is nothing else like you in this world!         Do you believe in helping the homeless? [If yes] Take me home with you.         The only thing I want between our relationship is latex!         Hi, I just wanted to give you the satisfaction of turning me down; go ahead say no.         "You look like my first wife" "Really? How many times have you been married?" "Oh I'm still a bachelor"         "I know why Soloman had 600 wives, because he never found you."         Was your father a thief? 'Cause someone stole the stars from the sky and put them in your eyes!         You look like the type of guy/girl who's heard every line in the book...so what's one more?         Is it hot in here or is it you?         Screw me if I'm wrong, but you want to kiss me don't you?         Do you know the essential difference between sex and conversation? (No.) Do you wanna go upstairs and talk.         Hi, I'm not trying to pressure you, I don't want to have sex without mutual consent; and by the way, you have my consent.         As she's leaving.......Hey aren't you forgetting something? She: What? Me!         Didn't I used to always pull on your ponytail in grammar school?         What's your favourite colour?         I miss my teddy bear. Would you sleep with me?         Excuse me, do you mind if I stare at you for a minute? I want to remember your face for my dreams.         If I said you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me?         I'm not looking for a relationship, I'm looking for an experience.         Do you have a map? Because I keep getting lost in your eyes.         If you've lost your virginity, can I have the box it came in?         Do you sleep on your stomach? If not, can I?         I know milk does a body good, but DAMN...How much have you been drinking?         Are you free tonight, or will it cost me?         I like maths. You want to go to my room, add the bed, subtract your clothes, divide your legs and multiply?         I'm new in town, could I have directions to your apartment.         If you were a pair of pants I'd wear you out!!         I've just received government funding for a four-hour expedition to find your G-spot         You might not be the best looking girl here, but beauty is only a light switch away.         I may not be the best looking guy here, but I'm the only one talking to you.         Do you believe in love at first sight...or do I have to walk by again?         "I want to check your shirt label to see if you were made in heaven."         If you are what you eat, I could be you by morning.         I was just curious? Are you as good as all the guys say you are?         I'm a great swimmer can I demonstrate the breast stroke
8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	If I were you, I would let him move into his own place and get his head together.  And start to get on with your own life.  Dont wait around, dont be there for him, dont be predictable.      [Eg. tonight dont be in when he gets home, dont leave his tea out, go and visit a girlfriend or your mum, anything!!! - that will shock him!]    It will be HARD and will take a lot of decisive action but when he eventually makes up his mind what he wants - whether its being with you or not - you will be a better stronger person!    I wont say all men but some men will take advantage of you in this situation.  A friend of mine just waited around for her ex to make up his mind and in the meantime was at his beck and call, and he never got back with her, he just enjoyed 'using' her.    Remember, you are SPECIAL there is no-one like you and you deserve the BEST and to be treated the best!  Not to put up with someone who is messing with your head and your heart.  You don't need to look for 'signs' you KNOW what if feels like to be loved, dont sell yourself short!|`|ppF6oSCQaa	Don't bring up heavy topics.  Just chill and let him enjoy your company and tell him you love him.|`|Mal66j0kaa	Don't be selfish listen to the man and give him what he wants.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	I think these signs are a cover up to what is really going on here. What is wrong in talking about what the problems seem to be in the marriage. You can go on like this for awhile. But eventually, things will turn around again and the trouble will be brewing AGAIN. You can only AVOID your problems for so long. DEAL WITH THE ISSUES!!!!!!!|`|RAGAcJV7aa	give him doggie points sounds like he strying to make it work. take one day at a time but you try to  make it work as well and you should be okay|`|spXPpyP0aa	JUST TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL|`|pOCabUMvaa	The way things are going now for you, I would not call it normalizing.    I would say that he is still confused and that he does not know what he wants, and you should just let him go.    I would tell him that he needs to find out what he wants in life and until then, he should not keep in contact with you.    If and when he finds out what he wants in life, he will let you know.    Until then, let him go.    Life is too short for all the stress he is giving you.    I suggest you both go your separate ways.

ub2Dtzn0aa	I would say things are pretty bad between them. There's likely a fundamental lack of honesty in their communicating that is keeping them from ever arguing/disagreeing. Even if one person is submissive and another dominant they are still going to find points where they conflict. It would seem immensely boring to be sharing your life with someone that never had a differing point of view or opinion on the world and you weren't able to discuss it and both learn from each other.|`|189233d5651c6d19d5903bb45454ecd9aa	It depends on how you define "argue."<br>  <br>  My husband and I do not argue.  We make the same amount of money, do equal shares of the housework, and have equal interests and education.  Neither of us has more "control" in the marriage.<br>  <br>  We sometimes disagree, or misunderstand each other slightly.  Usually, discussions on these misunderstandings last about 10 minutes max, and we move on.  We never raise our voices or behave unfairly.<br>  <br>  Frankly, I DO think my marriage is better than most, but that's because we work very hard on it.  We want to be together, and we are willing to talk things out.  It probably helps that we married later in life, and both have a good knowledge of counseling and psychology.<br>  <br>  I think it's good for couples to disagree, and no marriage is perfect.  If someone is bragging about the fact that they don't fight, then they probably are lying or dealing with "secret" issues.  <br>  <br>  However, if YOU ask someone, and they say "no, we don't fight," you should believe them.<br>  <br>  It's rare, but it does happen!<br>  <br>  Good question... thanks for asking!|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	LIE<br>  Everyone argues. It's healthy to argue. It's helps you figure out the needs of the other person. If you are in a relationship and NEVER had a fight, someone in that relationship is holding back a WHOLE lot of stuff, and I don't want to be around when it all comes out.|`|i6p9dJOSaa	It depends on how it's put... like, I would say, my husband and I don't fight.  When I say that, I don't mean we never disagree.  I mean, we don't yell at each other, and we don't say hurtful things.  We DO disagree and we occasionally snap at each other.  I think my husband doesn't disagree with me enough (or I should say, he doesn't SAY he disagrees).  He really hates confrontation and hates to be embarrassed or look bad in any way. <br>  <br>  Actually, people need to disagree and they need to air their disagreements.  But you can still do it respectfully.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Hmm...<br>  <br>  I would think that they:<br>  <br>  Don't live in the same State, or Possibly Country<br>  <br>  Don't have ANY means to communicate with one another while living in a different State or Country<br>  <br>  Don't speak the same language (Literally!)<br>  <br>  Are incapable of writing nasty notes since they cannot speak the same language...<br>  <br>  LOL Everyone has disagreements and arguments|`|bqkfu6Diaa	It could be a dom/sub thing. But I think it's more of a matter of flat out lying. People get on each other's nerves after spending enough time together, no matter how much they get along, have in common, or like each other. If they haven't fought yet, step back and hide because the explosion is coming. Do not get caught in the crossfire.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	That person is either full of crap, or gets the crap beat out of them, and is afraid to say different. <br>  I love my husband to death, and wouldn't trade him in for anything, but to say we never argue or disagree is asinine.|`|79wOWoM0aa	One of three possibilities...<br>  <br>  1. They are lying.<br>  <br>  2. One of them calls EVERY shot and the other just goes along with it.<br>  <br>  3. They are that one in a million.<br>  <br>  The number who claim to be this kind of couple is much more common than one in a million.|`|jDT8yH7Raa	i would think they were lying.  i can see where the radio person is coming from, one is a door mat while the other is doing what they please.  sounds unhealthy to me.|`|jBigEy0Caa	I would have to somewhat agree with that.  I tend to be very dominant and we do not fight very often.  I don't like to fight so, we try to discuss and move on.|`|L0Hz227xaa	I thinks is untrue, everyone has differences and disagrees at times, so they probably arent communication there real feelings, and this will soon cause problems in due time.|`|PIQeh6kCaa	Probably true.<br>  <br>  Just say, "Oh you're so lucky to live in Stepford-ville", and then walk away.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	I think it's an outright lie that they say to look superior to others. Everyone argues with their spouse at some point. It might not be a knock down drag out fight but they still argue.|`|goY0JHzlaa	I always think of two things.<br>  1) they are lying<br>  or<br>  2) what a freakin boring relationship that must be.|`|xQnkYyocaa	I would say that someone is full of it! Everyone disagrees and has a heated conversation in the least|`|e1658dd6f8cadd2baaecc6d6db216dfdaa	I don't think my wife and I have argued in the 17yrs we have been married.  Disagree on things daily.|`|VtoHoEN5aa	I would think they are lying, however when my mom was alive, we never saw her and my dad fight. They were both very humble and laid back. They might have fought when we were not around, but I have to think that I guess it COULD happen.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Although that is NOT the way my marriage was.|`|bfb1c5edf7977808d60f58ff9b05e9d6aa	I agree with the guy on the radio. I also feel that two people who never argue or disagree have a relationship with no communication.|`|XwxuGMTDaa	I think they are lying ...|`|u1uECuFNaa	I think they are lying...or they have different views on arguing and disagreeing.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	I think they are talking about my relationship. We just don`t argue!|`|IvMPh09baa	I think its not a real relationship then.  Everyone should express their thoughts and feelings, and its impossible to agree on everything.  So if they are not getting into any arguments and always agree then one or both people are not fully expressing what they feel in the relationship. <br>  <br>  Its lacking real communication if there is no argument.  I think one of the things that holds a marriage together, is even though there are arguments and disagreements its how both people work through them and solve the problem.  It takes 2 people to solve the problem... but if there are just no problems then its impossible to have a real relationship.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	hell no way ....... all you have to do it talk to each other .. and work things out .. its so easy .. to do .. just talk ..|`|AA11705300	People do say that. Then they have kids. And that changes.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	That they are lying!!!|`|p75ZEmjXaa	What you heard on the radio is exactly what happens in my marriage.  We rarely argue and my wife is totally dominant.  I like being submissive but it's gotten out of hand and I'm trying to reverse it somewhat.  <br>  <br>  My wife has a "my way or the highway" personality, however she does a lot of things that I like, and frankly I rarely disagree with her, so the lack of fighting isn't that superficial.  On the other hand, if I oppose her in any way she gets extremely angry and defensive, and years ago she would totally stone wall me with silent treatment for days.  So I got "conditioned" to agreeing with her.  It's not good.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Bottom line not all couples argue, but all couples do disagree. For the people who say they don't then I feel sorry for them--they must be living with a clone of their self. Some couples even have other means of debate rather than arguing--but even these people do not agree with each other all the time or else they would not have an alternate way to deal with the issue.|`|2b0a3200c0db672cf39c688cc41d456caa	If someone said that to me, I would think they were uneducated because of their horrible grammar, and then I would think they are full of crap.  Either they're full of crap, or they're in a terribly unhealthy relationship.  Married couples will never agree on everything all the time.  If that happens, someone is hiding something, or subduing their own feelings, and it will eventually get to be too much.  Unhealthy.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Well i agree w/the guy on the radio. my hubs is more submissive and i'm more dominate but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. my hubs is just really laid back, and i'm very outspoken. opposites attract!<br>  <br>  we DO have disagreements, but we don't "argue"- meaning we don't yell at each other, we don't call names. my husband has never raised his voice to me, nor me to him...it's called respect....but i get what you mean. still we must be doing something right, 8 yrs of marriage, known each other for 10yrs and have 4 kids.....and we are both still sane and have a great relationship. hmm.....yep! <br>  <br>  course i never say this thinking it's all "fairytale" or perfect and never to try and act superior, it just is what it is.|`|94gC814Eaa	To me it sounds like some one is holding back their feelings and opinions just to keep from conflict. I've heard of couples hardly ever fighting but never? Someone is full of it or has a really unstable relationship. Its healthy to release your feelings, you don't always have to be on your best behavior people.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	I think that sounds strange.<br>  <br>  It isn't normal....IMO.<br>  <br>   (( I'm sure that if we had heard the second part of Cinderella's story, we would have found out that her marriage to Prince Charming WASN'T perfect at all...! ))|`|uuMCGT9taa	i think they do bicker but dont think its arguing or disagreeing.  <br>  <br>  i use to be one of those  but at time went by it wasnt a fairytale  after all !<br>  <br>  <br>  they lie !!!!!|`|5MAx8mHxaa	if they never argue one of them is probably in a coma

This is really serious.<br>  I am so sorry that your parents are so horribly ineffective in handling this situation. There is so much your mom and dad could do, but it seems they are in denial, and they probably believe that their golden boy can do no wrong, so they do nothing.<br>  <br>  The next time your brother "accidently" leaves his computer in the bathroom, I recommend that you pack it up, and take it to the cops. They can search his hard drive for any illegal pictures, and then intervene on your behalf, if you are right.<br>  Please don't think that you are doing anything wrong, or are the one getting your brother in any trouble. He knows what he is doing, and you have given your parents plenty of chances to take charge of this matter, but they ignored you, and now there has to be a consequence for their ignorance.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to go to the police, then find an adult you trust to follow through, and take the computer to that person.<br>  <br>  If your parents won't protect you, then it will have to be up to you to find someone who will.<br>  I don't want to alarm you, but I know that there are websites where idiots like your brother have posted voyeuristic pics of their wives, female friends, and yes even their sisters for the world to see. I hope your brother hasn't done that to you, but if you wait any longer he may go ahead and do such a dispicable thing. So speak up, and get some help.<br>  Another resource might be the Kid's Help line.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://kidshelp.sympatico.ca/en/help.asp" rel="nofollow">http://kidshelp.sympatico.ca/en/help.asp</a><br>  <br>  Above is the website for Canada, but if you are not in Canada, then search out one in your area, I am sure there will be one available to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope you find safety and security real soon.|`|TIqFAXo1aa	1 Lock your doors & talk to your parents again<br>  2 talk to a guidance counselor at school- they may have a suggestion<br>  3 call children services- they will scare the sh*t out of that perve brother of yours and your parents will take it seriously, knowing that it is bothering you that much|`|Ay7Fkvd4aa	You need to continue to talk with your parents this will not stop.

No, I don't mean to spy on his naked butt in the shower.  Use his stuff (or get your own stuff) to keep an eye on your privacy.  If you catch him on video doing something, mom and dad can't plausibly deny it happening.<br>  <br>  Third thing that comes to mind is telling your brother to stop.  Do it in front of your parents.|`|kuBBzXtiaa	aww sweetie, It sounds like this is really bothering you. I'm 13 too and I know at our age you kind of want your privacy, b/c your changing and all that. What your brother i doing is wrong and disgusting. You should sit your parents down and tell them seriously that your brother has been being a creeper and touching you in a way that makes you uncomfortable. You also need to talk to him and tell him that it has to stop and that what he's dong is wrong. If that doesn't work, tell your parents that you no longer want to stay there with your brother and that you would feel much safer and be happier if you stayed with a friend of relative for a while. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps and your brother stops touching you.|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	Tell your parents again...tell them if this does not stop - you will call the police on your brother (and then call them)  What he is doing is<br>  very very wrong and you do not have to put up with that. (If possible, hide a camera of your own and catch him in the act)|`|nKEKG0Cqaa	that's really crazy.  maybe you should let the camera record you (maybe not naked though) and somehow keep it and show your parents and prove it to them.  if they still won't listen, go to the police.|`|3i1lxvjsaa	he's older than you? than you really need to tell him to grow up and stop being a pervent towards his own sister, there's no excuse for doing things like that even if he is a teenager|`|2sdDQBV7aa	Talk to a counselor at school.  They can put you in touch with the people that can help, and make your parents see that it is effecting you,|`|FbNDv10caa	Oh my goodness. That's terrible. I know it's hard to wrap your head around but your brother is actually sick. As hard as it may be you should talk to a guidance counselor or even the police. They can help your brother get help and you to feel safe again. No child should ever feel unsafe in their own home.|`|e44CXZauaa	That is totally inappropriate! Keep a diary of anything he does which disturbs you in ANY way. Talk to your parents about this or if you want evidence first then you could set up a camera in your room at nights. Get a lock for your door if you can. Don't you have a lock on the bathroom door? If not you could jam it with a chair after checking for cameras whenever you shower.<br>   Your parents should listen to you if you feel so uncomfortable... if they don't try another relative or if necessary- the police.|`|w6qg2Hlgaa	The only way to stop his pranks is to go up to him personally and tell him how you feel. If this doesn't work, you have to fight fire with fire. Prank him back. Stick a rubber spider next to his pillow at night. Put peanut butter on his sheets, and cover it up with his comforter. If your parents ask, tell him he was eating the peanut butter out of the jar and you saw him. If it doesn't work, go to a counselor and talk to him/her about this situation. I hope that helps!|`|zvZnH2rRaa	whoa sweetie!!!!<br>  <br>  your parents don't WANT to believe your brother.  it doesn't mean they are bad parents, it just means that they don't want to think of one of their children doing something like that.  <br>  <br>  what you NEED to do is think of some way to make them believe you; keep the camera and show them the film, keep telling your parents over and over again everything he is doing, eventually they will believe you.<br>  <br>  you also need to tell someone outside of the house, like a trusted family member, a friends parents, a teacher, or prolly the best idea would be to tell your guidance councilor or the police.  they will get something done quickly if you tell them, it you can prove it that would be even better!  <br>  <br>  in the mean time you need to protect yourself!  lock your door at night, if you don't have a lock put some loud bells in the middle of the door so he wont be able to reach in and get then off.  it sounds really stupid but this way you will hear him in the middle of the night.  the nest time he puts the camera for the laptop in the bathroom, take the tab out and then drop it in the toilet, or smash it one the floor.  you may get in trouble for it but then you can just say "i didn't see it i mean why would he even have left it in the bathroom in the first place".  or the nest time you get in the shower and notice that he is recording you haler for you mom, real causally like you need her to get you a towel or something stupid, and when she comes in show her the camera and how it is recording you.  the next time you go to the store get some pepper spray and keep in near your bed, and it he ever tries to touch you again use it on him! and don't feel bad about it either!<br>  <br>  you are very right about it not being safe for you,  you need to tell the police or children services, and they will take care of it.  in the mean time protect your self.  <br>  <br>  you are getting a lot of really good answers so i hope you listen to us and do something about it, stay safe sweetie i hope you get some help.|`|zzvDybEiaa	You should put your thoughts on paper./ Daily Diary.<br>  <br>  Give him a note and keep a copy and date it, saying that his actions (and insert them here) are unwanted.<br>  They are of a sexual nature, and you consider it Sexual harassment and I'm am a minor, which means serious consequences, for him.<br>  And that you will be documenting every event.<br>  As well, give a copy to your parents, so that they cannot say that they were unaware.<br>  If your parents fail to intervene appropriately, all of the information will go to the police.<br>  You might also confide in your school guidance counsellor for support.
CqQ1DaKDaa	Ignore them, the only reason divorce rate is so high is because men and womens standards have changed ALOT since a century or two ago. I know that you can marry in Scotland at the age of sixteen. But I find that it should be easier if you move in together for a year or two to see whether or not you'd be compatible. That is what me and my fiance have done, and we're going to get married as it's proven quite successful. I was fifteen when he proposed and I'm turning seventeen in a few days.   I understand where people are coming from with the whole 'you've just reach puberty' but thats kind of idiotic. Who's to say how old you are when you fall in love? My fiance's parents are proof that you can marry young. They married very young, and now they're in their late fourties fifties and have never been seperated at all. I also know quite a few people with parents similar. Besides it's people who have kids and marry or marry because of kids, or marry without living with each other or marry then have kids too young that break up. So leave the kids until you're at least nineteen/twenty and have money as it puts ALOT of stress onto the relationship, I know from my sister and her husband.  So I hope you and your future husband have a happy life together :)  Raych|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Yes ....|`|AA10610878	why marry with 16th?? there's more to experience in life than to go into marriage soo early...|`|FSl1enpKaa	At sixteen, you probably are at the peak of your infatuation drive. It is clouding your ability to see reason, a quality that will see you through the bloom of youth.    To be honest, no place will marry you at such a young age, and if anyone does, he will leave with the bad conscience for many years to come. Come to think of it, you do not fully understand yourself. How in the world did you work it out that you understand your boyfriend enough to want to marry him? Hmm.|`|Cuvsocjgaa	Dear   Simply i hope that 16th is not the age of getting married.You can enjoy the Sweet 16 age but once you will be married automatically your love will lost in responsibilities and you both are too young to get married .I don't know about your B,Frd but you are too young to get married that for sure.  Another thing is that just play roll for just for a month as a married couple and you will get know the reality of married life.

Some of these factors are that you have lived separately from your parents for a specified amount of time and in doing so supported yourself.

There are States that will make an exception if the bride to be is pregnant or already has a child (which I don't encourage children to have children).  For those who do get knocked up, the bride to be has to go to a doctor and get a certified note saying they are pregnant and she needs to bring that to the office that sells the marriage licenses

Y8MakQ2laa	Miss Hernandez,    I totally understand that you are anxious to get your boyfriend back.  You love him and it feels like you may lose him forever.    However, these anxious feelings can make you act in ways that seem needy and desperate, and this will kill your chances of getting him back.    You see, if your ex boyfriend knows he can get you back whenever he wants, he will have a tendency to take you for granted.  There is no great motivation for him to get back together with you.    Here is what you need to do:    Back off and give the relationship a break.  No contact for at least a week or more.  Give him some time to miss you.  How can he miss you if you're always making yourself so available?    During this break, your ex boyfriend will start to miss you.  He will wonder if you've moved on or if you're maybe seeing someone else.  He will be worried that he may lose you forever.      If you stop making yourself so available your ex boyfriend will be much more motivated to get back together.      The approach I talked about here is very powerful because it works in harmony with your ex boyfriend's natural instincts.    I posted a link below to a very good blog that goes into this in more detail.  I hope this helps... good luck and I wish you the best.    Matt|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	Sounds weird; but have you considered  the possibility that he cheated on you and breaking up was a way of dealing with his guilt? If he wanted you back; why not just come out and say it. On a different level though; if you feel you HAVE TO MAKE someone see breaking up was a mistake or GETTING somone to love you the way you want; then the relationship won't work anyway. Loving you and being with you should be because HE wants to do it; not because you made sure he did.|`|dnGJ5JLgaa	Don't wait for him to realize it was a mistake.  You do it.  Ask him about it and just keep talking.  Tell him everything you just told us.  Tell him  "  I'm confused.  I don't know what you are trying to tell me or if this is a sign.  Can we talk?"  Then just tell him everything you have on your mind.    good luck!
om89gdFIaa	The death of a "relationship".  You mourn and grieve.  You remember the good times and the bad times.  You have good days, bad days and "bloody awful" days, and unfortunately, at first, every day seems one of the latter.  But, gradually, things turn around and the good days outnumber the bad, etc., etc.,  You keep in touch with your son as much as possible, by phone, letter and email.  He will always be your best friend and, from the way you come across, you and your husband both seem to have your son's best interests at heart.  That is what matters most.  You will move on, physically and emotionally; life has a way of doing that, but, naturally your "life" will never be the same as it was.  Be open and honest with yourself; this will impact on your son.  Along with the hard times, just think how much you will look forward to hearing from him, by any means, and vice versa  Holidays will be something to really look forward to, wherever they may be.  Always planning for the next visit etc., will certainly make the time go quicker.  I hope your move goes as smoothly and painless as possible.  Good Luck.  Christine|`|LomICtW1aa	Guess you have done the right thing rather than brooding in a relationship that does not exist.  So start a new life again. find new friends and relationship.    But don't work to a marriage again.  Most who start this way, end up getting married again after a few years and ruin their life again.    Become like a sister to your son,, and your ex-hubby your brother. and you can give good care to your son ..  Shift your relationship with your ex-hubby to the internet, so you can stay in touch for your son's sake.    you can always get back together, if life compels you and probably stay as friends.|`|7609ac7e6e1d1a79b3957504fc7af390aa	I have 2 little girls. I love them more than anything in this world. My marriage is rocky, things are not easy but I would never ever leave them. You will regret it one day when he grows older and resents you for leaving him. He is going to have real problems when he gets older. He will always feel like you abondoned him.|`|wwmArsKJaa	Well, my own experience is that of your husband's, and I've watched my wife go through what you're going through right now.  The fact that the two of you are on friendly terms is a huge plus, and that will make things easier for everybody involved. I didn't say EASY, I said EASIER. The situation you're experiencing is still going to be a tough one.  I can only tell you that at the beginning, there will be many days when things seem hopeless, and you'll feel very alone, it'll bring you to tears. You have to keep moving. Keep living your life one day at a time, and eventually, the pain will go away, I promise.  I can't be of much help as far as your child is concerned, as I have none, but I'm sure it'll be very hard for him as well.  We had several pets between us, and with the exception of my aquarium, I let her keep all of them. From what I could see, and had heard, they didn't take it very well after I moved out. So, I'm sure, for a child, the experience would be magnified. He'll need a lot of love, and support right now.  As I mentioned earlier, though, you have to keep living your life one day at a time. That's all you can do, and don't let go of that.|`|723QHuicaa	I dont know how you can leave your child. Think of the abandonement thats little boy is going to feel. If i were you id move to the next town so as to avoid the ex, but still close enough to see my child every day.|`|AA10461616	Congrats on an amicable split, however, I don't even have children and it is by choice.  Even I find if difficult to go on vacation for a week and leave my beloved cat and two dogs and I am older than you are.  I put them first, as I love them and they are my responsibility.  Did you not really want to be a mother?  I could understand that, as I don't want to be one, but since you already have one, you have to put him first.  You may think you are doing that by leaving him for six years and having him stay w/ his dad for better education.  But, putting him first would mean you staying in the UK, but apart from his dad, until he is out of school.  If you have been living there for 18 years, isn't that your home and why would you need to move to New Mexico?  If it's just you, you can start a life anywhere with your son and the US has a lot of great schools.  I am not really understanding this and since I don't have children by choice and I feel this way, I am not sure others with kids will understand at all.  You plan on giving him the option at age 12 but yet the schools will still be the same in 3 years.      I think you will really regret missing out on so much of his life, even with holidays and summer vacation.  He may not even want to come see you at his age on summer breaks as kids want to spend summers with their friends.|`|3qLIRorjaa	You shouldn't be caring about yourself again. You have a young son, about the same age as my own son who should come first.    How you can leave him behind and only see him a few times a year  is beyond me.|`|f6A6UM2taa	i think you are thinking of ur son u want him to happy and have the best education u can and if that means he should stay with his dad, where all his friends are now then i think u are doing the best for him up until he is old enough to make up his own mind on where and who he wants to live with.    no-one says its gonna be easy for either of you to walk away and start again but i think you have done the right thing if u and ur husband are unhappy its best to change it now as that will reflect on ur child even more in the future.    you have to be strange and i hope it all works out for u all.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	i only wish you well.. i hope your plan works out for you ..lets hope|`|tTf1Zp5eaa	Sorry but you sound very selfish to me. You chose to have a child and that is a decision you make for life. You don't just abandon him when a relationship breaks down. I am a new mum and I could never imagine ever doing this. You say: "How do I start caring about myself first again?" You already are putting yourself first by leaving your son. How do you think he will feel when he is told you have disappeared to the other side of the world and he'll only see you twice a year?   Don't ask people to come on here and tell you what YOU want to hear because that is (how you put it) "bull"   I am in a rocky relationship myself so I am experiencing something similar to you, but I would never put myself before my son, ever.|`|Midbg5BJaa	Wow, first of all you and your husband need to be congratulated in the way you are handling this- in an adult and mature manner and putting your son first.    OK, I am assuming that visa issues are the reason you are not remaining in the UK to be able to stay seeing your son so I'll avoid that alternative.    Now on to you: you have to remain practical right now, you're moving over to the states where you have financial obligations, this means you have to get yourself over there, find somewhere to live and get yourself employed ASAP. These are your basics and need to be your sole focus.    Once you have got these, you can then start thinking about living a little, join a club, take up a new hobby, you'll start meeting new people and developing a social group. Things will blossom from there.    You have to set your expectations though- set goals based on your necessities before you expect too much from yourself.|`|haCssg2Laa	I dont think this is something you can make a plan to set out to do to be honest  you have hurdles to overcome before you will feel any sort of semblance of moving on  you have to face the situation of leaving you r child, and that will be MASSIVE  in itself, then you have to move to another country and find your self the basics, home, job etc, and THEN you have to settle into a normal day to day life, its going to be a very exhausting time for you mentally and i think it will sweep you along, you will have dark days, but eventually it will just feel less hard  you will always have the anticipation of seeing your son to look forward to, but you will also have to deal with saying goodbye to him too. Its going to be very hard  I know i couldnt do it  But if you have made your mind up, you are going to just have to focus on the positives if you wish to regain any sort of life for yourself|`|1kxqzyy9aa	sounds like you,ve gone into this with your eyes open,good girl ,there is no rush to do anything yet just chill for a few months consider your options then. you mind will be clearer|`|zka26204aa	You will do fine.  It will take time, but eventually your life will come back together.  My big concern is for your child.  It is going to be very difficult with you being so far away.  Every child needs a mother to nurture them.   Fathers  are generally not a nurturing as mothers, and boys usually bond more closely to the mother, whereas girls tend to bond more closely to the father.    If I were in your position, I would try to either stay in the UK near your child , at least until he has adjusted.  He is going to need a lot of emotional support while he is adjusting to the break up.  This could take a couple of years.|`|Ga9oCLavaa	I think you'll be in shock when the wheels touch down in New mexico.    you are leaving an awful lot behind, jobs are nearly impossible to find...

How can YOU pick up the pieces of your life? you are leaving your young son, who will forever feel inadequate and abandoned by his mother.     You cannot be a normal mother with normal feelings.  There is NO WAY on this earth i would leave my son.     How do you start caring about yourself first again? sounds like you already do lady, you're number one in your life for sure. Anyone who could live on the other side of the world to their six year old child, puts no one else first.

He can watch sports, hang out with the boys, or do whatever he wants without her nagging at him.

Wow i remember this stage in my life... i had the same fears, diseases, pregnancies, drama , etc.. Dude it' wonderful that she wants it with you... . best of luck to you and I hope this helps........ kindly let me know... Have a great day... BTW, I'm Alex from New York and I'm 31....... just a bit about me... The End....|`|pRTFjaK4aa	dump her.|`|6wYD6Z7Faa	You tell her what you want.  You want a relationship first and then sex follows.  Good Luck|`|9944787f7b97209854b4040a6d619d15aa	if you're 21 or older you gotta get that taken care in a hurry. if your 18 or younger then don't worry about it you'll lose your innocence soon enough. if you're somewhere in between those age groups then you gotta be a man. this is how men step up. you gonna suck at the sex the first time. might as well as to someone who will be good at it.|`|28ace4b478f0d1936cd87055ad9fff5eaa	How can you know that you "don't like girls like that"--if you've never had sex with one? How did you decide what foods you like to eat? By trying them? Or deciding in advance that you'll only eat pie with no top crust?
j3bE41RNaa	Just plan something simple. Think of all the things she likes to do, and just spend time with her.  I have had a boyfriend in the military before, and the easiest way for me to let him go on deployment was just to spend quality time together.     I know guys want to do something HUGE and something incredibly romantic....but honestly sometimes its just the time together that makes it all worth it.     Just make sure you don't do a lot of things where you arent able to talk and be face to face....because that is what she is going to remember|`|ZfWMnvW7aa	do you wana do something at home or go out? thats the first thing you have to decide on. once you've decided that its pretty easy. most girls are suckers for a romantic candle lit dinner (preferbly try to cook yourself) also lots of chocolatey desserts....and champagne ofcoz. If you going out then take her to a romantic spot where you can have privacy, i think you guys need as much alone time before you leave so i think its prob best to stay at home.|`|f8fs6kycaa	A sweet candle light dinner...|`|dBuONrv9aa	sprinkle your bed with rose petals light a Insense stick|`|zka26204aa	Flowers, a nice dinner out, and a romantic night alone with candles, chocolates, and Champagne.|`|OUtYUT8daa	awww. thats sad but so sweet at the same time.    Give her something of yours to keep till you get back?  Buy her something really special to the both of you.    Write her a poem?   Take her to a resterant and the movies/theatre (I dont know if you can do that if you're in the military though)        Just tell her really truthfully. look into her eyes and tell her how much you love her.  Easy.|`|vC2waUCeaa	I don't know what accomodation she'll be coming to but my this was what my husband did for me and I felt SO special :)    I arrived to a small note on the door - it led me to a trail of rose petals, little love letters all the way up the stairs... into the bathroom where a bubbly bath was waiting and a glass of chilled champagne. Clothes were hanging up waiting and the notes said not to rush, to take my time and relax. After I'd bathed and changed I followed the rose petals further and they led into the bedroom where a small table had been set up with candles and further champers waiting. It was then my hubbie walked in with a meal of chicken stuffed with prawns and smoked salmon (don't worry, he hadn't cooked, he had help!) dessert was strawberries and cream and.... well I don't need to tell you any more I'm sure!    It was very special and something I'll never forget.|`|6BhTjwoNaa	Just seeing you will be great. Most women love a complete surprise like a heart chain or something that expresses how much you love her.Also, even if that is possible or not. if you write her a sweet letter of your feelings and make it a Valentine letter saying all the things and many reasons why you love her, she can read it over and over again, and it can sustain her in your abscence.You two seem so in love, I can feel it as I read your words.When you have love like that you are a very lucky person.I suggested a written letter because the power of you written words , she can treasure over and over again.Other suggestions would be a cd of favorite love songs, or a scrapbook you make with your own hands of treasured times youve spent together.|`|e7d8eccb6f819fb0623145f8b7f2099eaa	Give her flowers and make love all day!!!|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Home cooked dinner, candles, soft music, hot bubbly bath, lots of hugs and kisses telling her how much you miss her and how you've so been looking forward to seeing her!    But you never know, you could plan all this and as soon as she arrives she may just want to go straight to the bedroom and make up for lost time!   Still you can eat your culinary delights later......|`|RAVTTlO4aa	candle light dinner|`|EENUWAP7aa	When your in the military it takes a heavy toll on marriages.  While I was stationed at Macdill in Florida, we had a TDY to Saudi Arabia. We were not allowed to tell our wives. It was a Top Secret Mission and so we were only allowed to say were going on a TDY and there's no contact until we get back. If there is an emergency they can call the base headquarters to reach us otherwise, she is alone for just 90 days.      That doesn't seem long, it's just 90 days, but for some it was nightmare.    Returning home to their loved ones was not like some had anticipated.    We flew in early that morning a day ahead of schedule. Some of the staff shot straight home only to find heart aches and pain.    Now your asking on here what is a romantic thing to do and I reccomend that you spend as much quality time with your wife as much as possible because that is all you have and that is romantic enough just being together means so much.    If you do a remote for one year while in Service, the odds of a marriage lasting...100:1    Retired USAF  71 TCF|`|jEU34C9jaa	give her a surprise dinner
TBPzDU2vaa	Hard to give advise, as it is not clear what you have written. How old is he? Is he a student age between 18-40?  Do his parents support him?  Has he a job, making money?  Why not tell him to be more of a positive nature making the best of what he has in life.  When he has the means to travel to Australia .. take the jump!?|`|91W8HrJiaa	Have you seen the movie "The Grudge"?  I'd get him outta there asap if I were you :-O|`|ayPAKhngaa	there must be private schools in austrailia. ask him to aply. if he gets in he can live in a dorm.|`|QJN8JfgDaa	that is a very difficult question. what is the age of your friend. Either way, he needs to tell his parents EXACTLY  how he feels. Then somethings needs to ben worked out|`|lVkcfcy9aa	1) The best i can think is to bring him back here, particularly NSW. If he is not accepted in school, then try tafe, He can learn and earn at the same time. I guess this way he can improve his life style, help his family economically and live happily. I hope it will be better for u as well to get a friend Back. GOOD LUCK

AA11227341	I think that age should not a factor, the age difference is not so far to where there could be room for criticism from others--"he stool her from the crib" which means that the guy is too old for her.    Yet, I see that it is you that is limiting this possible relationship from possible growth so think with your mind not your heart to avoid any possible issues later.  At this age, guys are not that committed to a real relationship but more of sexual adventure (not saying that every guy is like that but a high percentage are and some girls too).    Careful to whom you give your heart to for the pain can be lasting as you have endured before.|`|MC1V0VDuaa	its not the 50's any or you can do what ever you like ill answer you like this why not?|`|og3Tmn0saa	I am 24.  I wanted to go out with a 17 year old.  Age means NOTHING.  Maturity means everything.

I was fifteen when I met my fiance and he was eighteen. Neither my father or mother cared for the age difference. They cared about what type of person he was and whether or not he could provide me with the love and care I needed. Love can happen between two people at any age at any point as it is not limited by age or race or anything like that. So yes I adivse you go for it hun :)|`|6fZzRFIXaa	age aint nothing but a number|`|Cf8GBWTkaa	sorry. I was going to answer this question but I cant stop laughing long enough to think.|`|UZBULUuraa	That is not too many years. You are both adults now and at your age difference of 3 or 4 years is not very long. My wife is 3 years and 3 months younger than I am. I say you should go for it!|`|0qdlNoYJaa	age doesn't matters.......|`|K2h6M1xqaa	I've dated people a lot older and a lot younger than me.  Four years between two people is nothing.    Check your compatibility here. . .    http://pages.infinit.net/garrick/chinese...    Some people don't buy astrology, but you'll find when you meet somebody who is in your perfect trine, it's unbelievably good.  (Every animal sparks awesomely with those born four years before or four years behind it.  Multiples of four years in age difference.)    Every second zodiac sign on the Western charts are also good together as a general rule.  Odds do best with odds, and evens with evens.  Mix the two, and it will be hard.    But usually it's just best to jump in and see what happens!
nJOYHuyZaa	I guess it's different for each person.  For me, It was when I couldn't imagine my life w/o him.  My heart felt like it would jump from my chest when we were together & break when we were apart. You will move heaven & earth to be together. A lot of people confuse lust & love, but when you are truly in love, it's clear which is which.|`|48l0AX9Yaa	always think about him every second.|`|og3Tmn0saa	When, despite everyone telling you you aren't, you still insist that you are.  You just know, 100%, through and through, and no one can tell you otherwise.|`|MOXa0tvOaa	You just know. You don't have to ask this question.

I think you should talk to him about this. Maybe he thinks you's too are not as close anymore.Goodluck|`|m38dNEoDaa	I think it may be the fact that you don't see each other as much anymore, but it may be another reason, maybe he feels that you don't love him as much anymore. You should ask him. Or maybe there is something wrong with his penis?
08LNAL8Saa	well i think he's probably taking it a little bit perverted.. you know the way guys are.. we think in 2 modes.. sexual.. and slightly sexual... haha.. but in all seriousness.. just tell him that all you meant was that you wanted him to come over... and nothing else.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Beware - DON'T MEET HIM - HE MAY BE CREEPY.<br>  <br>  Don't go by yourself, have a group of friends to be safe.<br>  <br>  Safety first!|`|oJORZebKaa	I get so tired of these damn" does he or she like me questions" You childish kids both like each other because if you didn't like him you wouldn't be going to Y!A for answers on this sh*t.|`|ZYONnSk9aa	boys are like that they make crude jokes because they think it will get them a laugh or attention. Just forget him, he is to unmuture to handle you|`|1UDLn1Boaa	I probably though you meant "You WANT him"  not "you want him to come hang out".

Maybe he is too busy to sit at a computer waiting for you to sign on.  Maybe he is over analyzingg like you and thinking he shouldn't always have to be the one to say hello first.  Maybe you should meet in person and have a real two hour conversation!  Then start jumping to silly conclusions about where the two of you stand.|`|aczYezdDaa	Has he come out about being gay?Is he gay?Have you come out?The reason I bring this up is because this information is critical in this situation.If he hasn't come out yet or refuses to he might be fighting with himself about his sexual preference and probably scared about what he's feeling for you.Or it could be that he's just a prick that can't make up his mind.And also, how long have you known him?If you haven't known him long it may just be the post-awkward phase that people go through when first starting to hang out.Has he ever shown interest in public?If not he may just be playing you or like I had said before he may just be afraid to come out to the public.If you need more help or if all that I've just written looks only like MAMBO jumbo and you need my help deciphering it e-mail me!I'm always glad to help!<br>                                               Sincerely,<br>                                                   Danielle|`|DozD8lTGaa	ARGH! i hate it when that happens :( he will probably be like this for AGES! so, don't make effort and wait for him to talk - it may be months before he speaks but, i done it myself and months later he spoke first and we had a long conversation. he was like 'i missed you a lot!' <br>  <br>  then i was off with him because, i wasn't interested in him no more. he called me and texted me but, i just showed i wasn't really bothered... because i wasn't.<br>  <br>  so, ignore him for a bit and wait for him to speak.<br>  i hope i have helped. x|`|o86jUQ86aa	Oh that sucks especially if you have had some good chats. Sorry!!  But I wil have to agree with Rose...just ask.  Something like hey good to see you online...we don't chat like we use to what keeps you these days....Up front and honest that is how I like it anyway.  I am not a relationship guru to be sure. LOL|`|nGdH31Ucaa	i wouldn't get too worked up about this. <br>  <br>  i would try talking to him about it.. bring it up<br>  casually. like, "hey, we haven't talked much lately..<br>  how come?" <br>  <br>  no worries!|`|SL3BFDjHaa	lol... maybe his actually gotta go. His life is probably busier or his REALLY gotta go.|`|gYIdZ8Xuaa	he probably met someone and dont know how to tell you without hurting your feelings.|`|AA11346438	one of you(not sure which one) gave out TMI and now he's scared|`|5MuTwO6naa	hi.|`|ON7F1YRsaa	he lost interest.
ilx6DeVYaa	well, you should ask him that. maybe just split it up more. like an every other time thing. watch his stuff, then the next time, watch your stuff, then the next time, watch his stuff, etc.... if he doesn't like that, then he's just being selfish|`|5d94V16uaa	This ain't hard to figure out.  He doesn't like that sort of stuff on TV.  No big deal, make sure to watch something he likes too from time to time.  Or make him interested in your shows by treating him to some oral in the middle of the show, he'll not mind your shows after that.  Men are so easy to work with.  lol|`|eSx065Jhaa	Simply.. you are not completely good understanding . approach more togather .|`|zkV7BiRPaa	oh, yeah!<br>  i watched the one where asa was bulimic the otherr day.<br>  intervention.<br>  i love that show!|`|AA10199949	He sounds like my husband and I say to him, my brain craves real life situations and I can't help it... his brain craves channel forty-nine.. old movies but do I ask why.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Jen... honestly... he's just being a jerk! Sorry! :(|`|na2axA4taa	ill google it then get back to you in a min as i want to give you the best answer i can<br>  hope my answer helped and have a nice day x|`|CE4hcUmhaa	It may be that those type of shows bring HIM down- he may not like to watch shows about dysfunctional humans because he has had to deal with something similar in his past, or fears that he may have to deal with it in the future.<br>  <br>  Although I have to admit, the girl's answer about doing oral to get him interested is a tough answer to beat.|`|d2359ab4ecd6093abc8a4a670574eaa4aa	Do you always watch those shows when you two are hanging out?  That might be the problem.  You have to compromise for each other.  If he doesn't enjoy watching those shows, then don't watch them with him, or at least not as much as you are now.  Spice things up a bit, ya know?  :)|`|SnTBokvyaa	Well, have you told him why you like to watch those shows? If you tell him he should understand.  Just tell him that its not a big deal, i hope he leaves you alone after that (well.. TV wise)|`|8FqtGEuraa	i told u dump him

Since our wedding is simple, and we know exactly what we want, and are doing things ourselves, it isn't going to take much for planning. Mostly just coordinating everything that we already know we want. The only things that I really felt rushed about was getting the date set. Everything else has completely fallen into place! =)<br>  <br>  But, I believe most people plan their weddings in 9-15 months or so.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I just wanted to say that this is a really fun question!

I never really felt rushed, even though it was only 7 months of planning.  Actually, the week before the wedding, we basically had nothing left to do.

She wants you back.<br>  <br>  Then she'll dump you.<br>  <br>  She feels an empty void where you had dumped her.  Her pride took a hit that won't let her move on until she realizes what she's doing.|`|ewOD5x0taa	She sounds slutty. Steer clear of her.|`|pFwXujSUaa	good for you! girls like that are ssoo stupid!<br>  (i am a girl myself!) she trying too hard! good for you for dumping her! i hate girls (and maybe boys!) like that. eewww!|`|1ynYuF2Jaa	sounds like a ****. if you want to get back at  her then say stupid things about her, if not then walk away from her when she does that.|`|cFsPNXkiaa	Sounds like she's trying to get back with you or she's trying to get under your skin|`|JEg9THbNaa	if you have a new girl then forget about the old one. she sounds like a ho.|`|h9Eg6r81aa	if you like her... that's pretty hot=] haha
GZjFweX2aa	i think that u should sit him down and talk to him. tell him about how u feel and remind him about ya'll plans. but if he really want to go let him go. if u was his real friend then u would want him to be happy. people do go their separate ways and still keep in touch. so,if he do leave ya'll will still be friends. so, don't worry about it. ya'll can still be friends far distance.|`|nUIe5ZdEaa	Does he have to go back to England? Or is it a possibility he might consider? He might be doing what is best for him. Tell him you support him in everything he does but that it will suck without him. Remind him of all the plans you guys had in mind and he might think twice before leaving. good luck!|`|XVDfCFXBaa	unfortunately people grow up and things don't always work out the way you want them to. if you really are a friend then you will support him on whatever he wants to do. otherwise you were not a good friend to begin with|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I know it is hard to see a best friend especially move away for college,but you two can always stay in touch. You could even go visit him in England if you get the chance. After he moves away, the best way to deal with the loneliness would be to get involved with the college you are going to, stay in contact with your friend, join some activities that give you the chance to make more friends because you said you didn't have many. This will give you a better chance to make friends and be able to go out and have good times. This doesn't mean you will forget your friend because I am sure you will always wish he was closer, but for know keep yourself busy with activities and the friends that you do make along the way. Hope this helps you out and good luck with everything!
L0Hz227xaa	Your young, you just think ur in love, Stay friends and wait till you can move back or get ur own place. If its love it will stand the test of time. So just move on, meets a new guy and be friends with hi. Its not the end of the world. Your young remeber that. I really dont think ur in love, just crushing on this guy so u will be okay.
6utUL9Hiaa	I would avoid your family or tell them how it makes you feel when they made those remarks...it's better to hit the nail on the head then bury it under the rug...<br>  Also, with friends- try your best to make some new acquaintences and let the negative ones fade out of your life.|`|X5pFnRZpaa	make new friends and put up with the family.
f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	darn, it all sounded great till you mentiond Ryan Seacrest music.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	"girl of my dreams" does not have to be GF.  Is this your GF.  Otherwise you are really fantasizing.<br>  <br>  If this is your GF, then part of the battle is already won.  However, if the relationship is not sexual, don't expect her to go along with it.  That decision has to be decides between the two of you.  No unilateral fantasy.  <br>  <br>  I am not sure what the role of the uncle and nephews have to do with something so intimate.  I get it what you want the setting to be and I can only hope that she feels the same way about the song.  If not you got some changes to make.<br>  <br>  Just tell her what you desire and give her response consideration.|`|GrtqaUInaa	Just tell her! Girls LOVE to hear guys talk about that kind of thing! (:|`|lSGNCKitaa	TELL HER. that's adorable.|`|Y0IfewP6aa	Damn! if you to shy to talk to her then text or email her, and see what you get back.|`|uAzToWC7aa	in ur dreams. u silly goose!!!|`|bd54OdkDaa	Sweetie I don't know if you can tell how ridiculous this sounds.  Just tell her you like her without all the other stuff, ask her out, and see where it goes.D not start off talking about politics unless she brings it up or wait for a later conversation.That is not what a girl wants to talk about for the first date.|`|4gvw6nayaa	. . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-‘”. . . . . . . . . .``~.,<br>  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-”. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .“-.,<br>  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ”:,<br>  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,<br>  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}<br>  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}<br>  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:”. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./<br>  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .“~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./<br>  . . . . . . /(_. . ”~,_. . . ..“~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/<br>  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .”=,_. . . .“-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~”; /. .. .}<br>  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .”=-._. . .“;,,./`. . /” . . . ./. .. ../<br>  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..“~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../<br>  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-”<br>  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\<br>  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__<br>  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,<br>  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``<br>  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\.<br>  <br>  that would totaly weird her out!! and make her avoid you ...

She may just want the same thing.|`|JEg9THbNaa	keep it simple and just tell her you like her, you don't want to freak her out.|`|jWZ5Odyaaa	Probably best not to go through with it.|`|dthpLcVbaa	i am not sure if her newphew is into this.. maybe her uncle does though.|`|f17RMVa3aa	hahahaha lol wow<br>  <br>  don't tell her you'll freak her out big time|`|k4kxhjkNaa	Random!! you will freak her out.|`|oCaf3238aa	eew stalker much.?<br>  thats just creepy|`|YTHmYqllaa	........thats.....oddly specific........sorry dude i think you might creep her out
lSGNCKitaa	***** at her. tell her off to her face & say her diry secrets to her face in front of everyone. Show her that you're not the person she wants to mess with.|`|A57LMS5Qaa	alright. first off, if you dont want to loose this friend, DO NOT spread her secrets. you'll eventually be able to get over the fight, but that will just make it almost impossible to be friends again.<br>  <br>  slowly let loose some of the secrets into the crowd. make them REALLY detailed so they get all confused and messed up, and by the time it gets to her they will sound WAY worse then the really were said. like telephone. <3 good luck with....whatever you choose.|`|hKax9Jl6aa	Tell everyone she got an STD! That should do it..|`|Ukw1JUNcaa	Confront her and call her a coward for betraying you and spreading your secrets over only one fight. Don't tell anyone her secrets so you can show both her and your friends that you still hold respect for her despite your fight.<br>  <br>  In my experiences, direct confrontation looks better to anyone than spreading secrets behind someone's back. Good luck.|`|0A5Jtzqvaa	well, if you want to stoop as low as she has, start spreading the word as well or make flyers and distribute them, put an ad in the school newspaper or whatnot. As for those friends of yours that listened to her why want them back if they did not stand up for you and by your side?|`|wnr9S9kuaa	Spread a few rumors about her and try to freak her out.  Do it with your friends.  Or put ketchup packages in her locker right under her books.  Maybe even write a fake love note saying it's from the boy that she likes.  But first you'll have to act like you guys made up and that you forgave her.|`|35s330yiaa	you shouldn't get back at her she's just trying to make you mad now if you go up to her and say "you could tell the whole world all my secrets because that's not what a real friend would do and obiously u rn't nothing but a peice of trash on the floor.nobody needs u or wants you"tell her off even if u care alot tell her that she's not a very good friend and nobody wants her it will be hard be the better that way she may feel bad and she may not in the end you won't do anything but get introuble and relize it was just wasting ur time because shes just trying to get you mad so don't show it be strong|`|y7ws0PDIaa	there are plently of ways getting back at the biatcch you could get some of ur friends and go right up to her after school, and tell her off say you need to stop spreading rumers or ur gonna regret it and remember i know some of ur secerts, orrr you can do anthor way my favorite way, find some people who hate her as much as you do get on there side and ask them to scare her, like have them go up to her and say stop saying rumers about so and so or will kic ur butt. or do the same thing shes doing.|`|CS6lcyBpaa	start a fight shouting stuff for no sudden reason like " why did you bonk that old man or sumin " it will work.

nqINitkmaa	They are way too young to do this right now. They need to finish high school, college, then get settled into a career before they think about marriage. No your friend cannot get married with out parental consent until she is 18.|`|AA11380378	Only with parent consent or legal emancipation through the courts<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|JtEBaOdjaa	She will need her parents to sign legal documents allowing the marriage to take place.(because she is under 18)<br>  He is an adult in the eyes of the law and can sign his own documents.  I'd tell her to wait a year, do you really want a permission slip to get married? lol<br>  Anyways, legally speaking, if her parents will both sign off on it then she can marry him.<br>  <br>  EDIT: even in Vegas she'd need her parents. Let me explain why:<br>  18 is the age the law says you are an adult. Until then you cannot enter into any contracts.  Your parents must enter into them on your behalf.  Marriage is a contract, just like any other, so you must be 18 to enter into it. However at 16 you can enter into marriage with parental permission.  Make sense?  I hope so. I tried explaining it the best I could. lol|`|268fbadb7ead2c9b7c16ca2a28b85c7baa	the parents need to give permission!!<br>  it is better to wait!!<br>  enjoy of being boyfriend and girlfriend!! (tell it to your friend!!)|`|eN5xA6RKaa	if the 17yr olds parents sign the papers saying that she can get married they can.|`|0c8b5589d3a30a3b9cd46d4620faeb5caa	the one younger than 18 needs her parents to sign and give permission.. hope they are happy (:|`|3QCpu8EAaa	people here do not seam to know ow much things has changed yeas they can get married without no consent  of no one.<br>  god  bless and good luck..
5r2Csdzwaa	Beat off to her photo and forget about that home wrecking DOLT!|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	stay loyal|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Stop the contact, you're married. Playing with fire usually ends up with someone getting burnt.|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	It would all depend on how happy you are in your current situation.  If your wife if an demanding, unloving cold fish, and I do know some like that - where even her friends tell her to treat her husband better or someone will come along and treat him like he should be treated and he'll be gone, but I digress, -- If that is the kind of marriage you are in, then you may have hit the jackpot if the ex feels the same strong emotions for you.  Life is too short to over look true love.  It never comes for some.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Oh honey it's completely natural!  Time heals all wounds.  You're thinking about all the good, fuzzy times that you and the x had, right?  How you felt when you first met her, before responsibility and life got in the way?<br>  <br>  Wake up, honey.  You're divorced or apart for a reason.<br>  <br>  Splash some cold water on your face and do something nice with your wife.  <br>  <br>  Quit thinking about the x.... it's not going to have a good outcome.|`|gfHutvEFaa	stay away from said person. You're feeling like this because it's someone "different" who you USED to have feelings for.<br>  <br>  Don't mistake "feelings" for love. Can you honestly tell me you would be happy without your wife in your life? Forever?<br>  <br>  Don't "fix" things that aren't broken.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Let it go or try to rekindle the flame with your spouse. Don't let it distract you from the fact that you already have a partner. If you aren't happy with them, then that's a whole different story.|`|LjV0MTQYaa	They are just thoughts from past feelings coming back. You are married. Have been for 10 years. <br>  Get closer with your wife. Realize how much you love her. Be passionate. Do nice things for her and have great sex (seriously, it'll help). If you have kids, spend time with them. The more you spend with them, the more you will realize how wonderful it is.<br>  <br>  This ex is an ex. It's over. It was over for a reason.|`|naequcqlaa	IF you are married, do NOT act on any old feelings or emotions.  Things in the past should remain just where they are.  Some things are better not mentioned rather than to hurt others.  If you were meant to be w/him you would be. I'm a firm believer in that things DO happen for reason even if we know the answers or do not.  For some reason things didn't work out in the past & should be left alone now in the future.  What goes around I've found does come around.  If you do things to please yourself at another's expense, you w/just pay for it in the end.  It's NOT worth it, trust me.  From my own experiences throughout life we do get what we bargin for.  That old saying of don't wish for things because you just might get them is oh so true.  But the thing is, it isn't always for the best.  Be grateful for what you now have, & have an attitude of gratitude.  Think of all the things you now have that you're thankful for & leave well enuf alone.  Best to you...:)|`|0ZTrJaRLaa	These thoughts and emotions shall pass. We all reminisce on the past but that's all it is THE PAST. You obviously chose your wife over anyone else. If she means more to you than a fling, cut off all ties with the ex before you do something you regret.<br>  <br>  Rekindle the romance with the wife!|`|0KLu4hRaaa	If you love your wife move on. If you respect your wife as another human being who deserves honesty and faithfulness then move on. If you just have to have your ex back be prepared to pay the consequences of your actions.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Stop right now and focus on your marriage.  Who doesn't feel a little wanderlust from time-to-time?  It's normal.  If you don't want to ruin your marriage you have to put it behind you and focus on your marriage today...|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Well what you need to do is cut off contact with that person.You are married and you should only be thinking about your husband.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	Yup.  And you're remembering thoughts and feelings from the past.  Get over it.  You're married now.|`|EbYroyhsaa	It is completely natural that even though you are with someone, you might come across someone who you find attractive and stirs some emotions. This is normal and we are only human. <br>  Your situation depends on so many factors- sometimes we are more likely to feel strongly attracted to others besides from partners when we are having difficulties with our own relationship. Are your needs met in this current relationship? be really truthful with yourself here, and bring any concerns to your wife for discussion. she might be feeling the same thing and then you might feel relieved, and be able to work on it. The extent to which you work on it depends on how important your relationship is. You both have only one life and make sure it is a fulfilling one.|`|R1vvH4aKaa	Here I am a person that went thru the same experience. I had both my wife and her at the same time. My wife knew about her and viceversa. It was a situation when a man loves two women at the same time with the same intensity. We used to go out together and we had a blast. But the ex wanted to play the game of for me only. <br>  <br>  My wife noticed it and told me. When I confronted the other all hell broke loose. Under those circumstances where I told both of them that they were non negotiable the other made a decision and went away. Nowadays after 4 years of the event I still miss her. <br>  <br>  My advise do not play behind your wife. If your wife is an excellent women do not do it. As for my experience, nowadays my relation is stronger than before. I have proven to my wife that I will never leave her nor trash her for another women. <br>  <br>  The other is around trying to make ends meet! While we at home are in peace and financially secure. <br>  <br>  Bottomline you two broke because of there were issues and I bet that those issues still around. My experience and advise is, I you do not want to badly crash and burn steer clear of that old love!<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  PS Remember, I went through that road!|`|G2tXZgrPaa	Forget about them. Remember you broke up for a reason...when you are getting emotional about the past, think about the bad times and I'm sure you will forget about the good ones.<br>  Your married, you love your spouse, don't give that up for something that is probably nothing.|`|1S1jbxF6aa	ignore them<br>  you are married!

bvFl873Jaa	Fact is that your mum has had all her life making friends so if she can't afford to loose this one, then she should give you the chance to go out and make friends too.|`|cYsPx9sSaa	you cant you tell her straight up, its you or her, end of|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	Tell your mum it's actually illegal for anyone under 16 to be at home alone or with other kids, fact, then she can't make you do it, I think you should also tell her about him touching you by the way xxx|`|X5pFnRZpaa	why are you looking after someone elses brat anyway. i would say stick it but in your situation thats not possible. Say to her that he is not your responsibility and tell her that he touches you because thats kinda weird.
yYPU8e5daa	well he obviously find you attractive due to what you have said let me explain : well as you said before he kept grabbing your waist so he is attracted to you and he is jealous of you kissing someone else in the play  if he didn't fancy you he wouldn't be jealous trust me ive had a lot of experience as a guy and i was jealous and stuff in the play when my GF kissed my someone else so trust in yourself he has something for you :D|`|AA12218857	He likes you, and by flirting with the blonde girls, he's trying to make you jealous!|`|Jlhti4oWaa	he likes you!<br>  And the flirting with blonde bimbos?<br>  yeah that's him showing off for you..!|`|X5pFnRZpaa	he likes you other wise he wouldnt care if you were kissing someone else.|`|ZkNZuGN8aa	he likes u, but bcuz u dont c it, hes trying 2 make u jealous, or hes a chavy bstrd|`|zTBscfuraa	duh.....<br>   he likes you|`|SI5KRCnfaa	Okay, first of all, it easier to jsut say like... 4 letter word! lol Anyways, it sounds like he's into you and he just thinks you dont like him as more than a friend.... so when you asked him to stop with the hand on waist thing he thought it was like you were rejecting him so just tell him how you feel. he likes you.... alot..... <3
WeSdUJy9aa	I'd say don't fight over a guy.  Just look for someone who is only into you.  Obviously he doesn't like you that much...sorry :(<br>  Probably what will happen is once you stop showing interest, he'll come after you.  Boys are silly.|`|sxJgu3C9aa	Expressing TRUE feelings , shared, is through a direct, person to person way.<br>  Not through intermediaries.<br>  You'll know the right answer is he tells you directly.|`|1Q2nDb8Saa	he likes the other girl more sorry this happens a lot in my school and it's happened a lot in my life but to other people and im pretty sure he likes the other girl|`|5FogPrZaaa	Well if he buys one of your best friends chocolates instead of you, obviously he's leaning towards your friend as a potential girlfriend instead of you|`|9L9g1Jh4aa	if he didn't buy you chocolate and he bought some for her, then he doesn't deserve you. you can do way better than that jerk!|`|fYAjV0GGaa	He didn't buy YOU chocolate. So I guess he likes her more.

Ukw1JUNcaa	The first thing I would do is confront your guy-friend about what happened. Explain to him that you were simply talking about him as a joke, and that what you said was taken out of context. You were joking around because he was as well. Tell him it was a miscommunication; he should understand because he heard from "someone who heard from someone who..." etc. Let him know that there's no need to tell his friends to tell you not to get your hopes up, and that you wish he would have told you that to your face. Hopefully he'll understand.|`|nUIe5ZdEaa	Your friend might have tried to sabotage the chace (if any) you and that guy could have had. (since she might like him too) Dont be naiive, you'd be surprised. Also, make sure you tell your guy friend that you know the guy you like didnt mean he loved you literally. And if you can, tell the guy too. good luck. This will be funny in one month I promise!

bO2rzfISaa	God has no place in our government. Some Americans are Christians (or members of other religious groups that believe in god), many are not. This is not a theocracy. If you want one, move to Iran.<br>  <br>  Some members of the govt may be guided by their religious beliefs when making state decisions (like George Bush), but we are not a religious state.<br>  <br>  Our Constitution and the Supreme Court prohibit it:<br>  <br>  The separation of church and state is a legal and political principle derived from the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reads, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . ." The phrase "separation of church and state" is generally traced to an 1802 letter by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptists, where Jefferson spoke of the combined effect of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. It has since been quoted in several opinions handed down by the United States Supreme Court<br>  (wikipedia)|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	It means that the Government and churches/religions must remain as seperate entities from each other. The truth is that it cant happen and intertwine together somewhere along the line, but in theory it exists for whatever reason other than someone once upon a time had a better idea|`|bqkfu6Diaa	A big part of the problem is that most people have their own idea of what "separation of church and state" actually means. There is no clear description of what all is and is not included by this phrase. Another problem is that the term "separation of church and state" is not spelled out word for word in the Constitution. Though it is implied by some parts, it is not clearly stated and can only be found in other papers written by some of our forefathers, such as Thomas Jefferson.

Eleven years is a huge difference -- she's a kid!

She still has her whole life ahead of her, and if you put the thought into her head that you want to spend the rest of your life with her, you might indirectly encourage her to throw away everything she's worked for to be with you.<br>  Her mom's love life has nothing to do with you and her daughter, she's simply protecting her daughter. My parents have been married happily for 30 years and they wouldn't let me date a guy eleven years older than me either!

Although you may be different most older men who go for younger girls do not have the best intentions.<br>  <br>  Her mother has experienced life beyond what both of you know so she has her own ideas just as you do.  You have no reason to confront her mother.  Just understand she is doing her job as a mother.<br>  <br>  You should at least wait until she is 18 and legally able to be with you.  After all, the mother could press charges out of spite and you want to avoid being in that situation.  Wait til she's legal and then let your actions towards this young lady show that you are the right person for her.

As women begin to internalize the criticism and believe it's valid, self-image sinks lower and lower. They start feeling worthless, incompetent, unlovable. ( After all, when someone who knows them so well thinks they are so worthless and unlovable, then "it must be true.")<br>  <br>  "Sticks and stones ... " and that saying of old keeps many women in place until verbal abuse has destroyed self-esteem, making leaving even harder. They even start thinking that if this man loves them, they should hold on to him.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  About abuse…How are you affected?<br>  <br>  * Are you unable or afraid to make decisions for yourself?<br>  * Do you do anything you can to please your partner or not upset him?<br>  * Do you make excuses for your partner's behaviour?<br>  * Are you forgetful, confused or unable to concentrate?<br>  * Have you noticed changes in your eating, sleeping, alcohol or drug use?<br>  * Have you lost interest or energy to do the things you used to?<br>  * Do you feel sick, anxious, tired or depressed a lot of the time?<br>  * Have you lost contact with your friends, family or neighbours?<br>  * Have you lost self-confidence and feel afraid that you could not make it alone?<br>  <br>  What can you do about it?<br>  <br>  * Realize that emotional abuse is a serious problem and you can get help.<br>  * Recognize that emotional abuse is as bad or worse than physical abuse.<br>  * Take your own safety and the safety of your children seriously.<br>  * Know that emotional abuse can lead to physical violence or death.<br>  * Know that you are not to blame for your partner's abusive behaviour.<br>  * Find people to talk to that can support you. Consider going for counselling.<br>  * Do not give up if community professionals are not helpful. Keep looking for<br>  * Someone that will listen to you and take emotional abuse seriously.<br>  * Recognize that you have the right to make your own decisions, in your own time, and that dealing with any form of abuse may take time.<br>  * Trust yourself and your own experiences.

Remember that you are your own best source of knowledge and strength, and that you already have the tools you need to survive. <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Your husband is selfish and manipulative. HE is emotionally ill; and he should get professional help. <br>  <br>  The problem with abusive husbands like yours is that they can harm you and make you believe that they are OK and you are not.<br>  <br>  Look for help.

I think that just even wanting to get over it is very commendable on your part because many times people throw in the towel.<br>  <br>  I think something you might do is make him be accountable for what he is doing with his time. How long does it take him to travel to and from work? How many hours a day does he work? What is he doing on his off days? <br>  <br>  It's important to understand that lying can become second nature to some people and breaking that may be harder than house training a two year old outside dog. <br>  <br>  Be patient and pray for him.

You also can get the trust back, but one thing, you do not forget.  Whatever the situation was, is always going to be back in the memory of your mind.  But time does heal.  It's too easy to say to get over it & forget it, but I'll bet he wouldn't.  We all have hurts from time to time, yes they do fade, but nothing can totally erase them, I don't care who you are.  The biggest thing is for him NOT to do it again.  When you do regain that trust, he must also change his ways.  By not doing that, you never w/be able to trust him again & all you've done w/just be done in vain.  That too is very important.  So basically it's all up to him as to how soon you can heal & that the wound is not reopened again.  I too well know your feelings but have been able to over come them in "time".

I mean 105 is pretty damn thin!  Maybe try to get help from family or friends to bring up to her also about her rapid and extreme weight loss and how unhealthy it is looking.  If she's not listening to you, try to get a friend or a family member to talk to her about your conerns.<br>  <br>  ADD: wait, I didn't read that you hadn't even talked to her about it yet.  Tell her as calmly as you can, that you are getting concerned about her weight loss and though she is beautiful you prefer her healthy.  Beautiful to you is healthy looking with some xtra lbs. on her.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Don't express your concerns in terms of appearance or the way she feels, but in terms of her health.  She's a little too slender for her height, but not into the dangerous category yet.  <br>  <br>  Why don't you try letting her know that you're concerned for her health.  Women who are thinner tend to be at higher risk for osteoporosis as they near menopause.  Also, if you're thinking about having another baby, talk to her about the risks of miscarriage (which are higher in underweight women).  Talk to her about the risks of being underweight, and suggest that you start working out together to help build up muscle (and also increase her weight, and possibly make her body feel less bony to you).|`|jDT8yH7Raa	tell her you love that she is so concerned with her apperance, but you love her the way she is.  ask her not to lose anymore weight.  if she continues, you need to be honest and tell her you are losing your attraction to her, honesty hurts, but sometimes you gotta be honest.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	Dude, hopefully you undestand that LOVE should be about the PERSON SHE IS, not the body the person comes in!<br>  <br>  <br>  WOW!<br>  <br>  sounds to me like this is YOUR issue not hers.|`|5MAx8mHxaa	wow dude, poor you for not being attracted to her. Did you ever think maybe she's sick or got hooked on meth or something where she's not eating.|`|NGKwsawdaa	So what part of this are you worried about? that you are not attracted to her or that she is getting to thin and you are concerned about her health. If you are concerned about her health then speak to her about it. Let her know that she was beautiful before she got extremely thin. Maybe since she had the baby she doesn't feel attractive enough so she feels like she needs to loose weight. <br>  <br>  If you are more concerned about being attracted to and not her health, then i think that you should reevaluate your relationship with her. You are with her because you supposedly love her, not because of how she looks or how much she weighs.|`|VH4YeaZYaa	I understand why you may feel this way, but you should love her not her body. But then again that is much too thin, I mean I am 5'5 and still a teen, and I weigh 112 and am in no way overweight. When you talk to her about it simply tell her that you love that she is trying to get healthier and loose a little wieght but also explain to her that you are worried that she may be overdoing it. Show that you are concerned for her health.|`|b0g9hOdjaa	The first thing you need to do is find out why she lost so much!!  Was she nursing?  That burns serious calories and if she saw the weight coming off it may have too hard to resist.  Is she depressed?  After having a baby she might feel like her life is in total chaos.  Controlling her weight is something she can hold on to.<br>  <br>  What are her eating habits like?  If she is starving herself (eating less than 1200 calories a day), you might need to consult a professional as to how to deal with her.  <br>  <br>  If she is eating normally and seems happy with herself, let it go for a little while.  People's weight goes up and down during different stages of life.  My husband lost 90 lbs about 4 yrs ago.  He was at the weight the charts say he should be at, but he looked sick to everyone.  He always carried a little weight on him since childhood.  He stayed super thin for about a year or two but then he started to slowly inch his way back up.  He is now at the weight he was when we married which is about 40lbs more than his thinnest.  I was really turned off by his build and sex was awkward because all the soft spots were all of a sudden bony.<br>  <br>  Hang in there, try not to make her feel bad about herself.  If you have to picture her heavier in order to get aroused, do it.  If you have to picture a complete stranger, or watch porn ahead of time, do it.  You don't want to create a rift in your marriage over this.  Trust me, it won't end well.  <br>  <br>  Mind over matter baby!|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	What do you see when you open a magazine or watch a movie. Society has women thinking if your not skin and bones your not fashionably excepted. Case in point Angelina Jolie she is so bony a gust of wind would blow her away but the magazines talks about how beautiful she is. Tell your wife how you really feel and don't hold back most women don't know how bad they really look until a loved one like you points it out. Tell her what you told us sure it will hurt her feelings but she will get over it. We wives want to look good for our husbands if you don't tell us how you really feel then we think you like the way we look. Stop hinting around because we don't take that serious enough plus we can't read minds.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	Not much you can do, just be glad she's not going in the other direction.  I come from a skinny bonesy family and I'll tell you the best way to deal with it is weight lifting.  You don't want people to just put on flab... they need to build muscle and resistance.  <br>  <br>  Maybe suggest the two of you join a gym together.  Not just little weights for the basement... she needs some serious lifting.|`|3b352647c1451744c77be95b0723c695aa	I honestly think that you should be straight with her.

Obviously your feelings are just as important as hers. So you don't want to blurt out, hey I don't feel the same about you. But, at the same time you need to let her know how you feel.<br>  The only thing that I am questioning is why this has so much affect on you. Yes, you should be attracted to your wife, but generally people who are married have a stronger connection with WHO the person is. <br>  Anyway, this bothers you so you need to find a way of telling her gently. Start out with something like, honey....I'm worried about your health. Tell her she has lost too much weight and you are concerned. If that doesn't work, simply tell her she needs to put on more weight. Not too many woman would be hurt by that one.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Pulling away from her emotionally, not having sex, feeling uncomfortable with cuddling and such. All of these things combined will do more damage than could be done by spelling it out for her and her taking it bad. The cold hard truth is that you are attracted to a certain body type and less attracted to another type. It's ok to feel that way. It's natural, and you need to accept that about yourself. However, her weight and size likely have a major impact on her self esteem. Just suppose she gained the weight and looked perfect in your eyes but felt like she was fat and ugly. She may pull away emotionally and avoid sex. Then what?<br>  <br>  Here's the deal. You have more control over yourself and what you do rather than her, how she feels, and what she does. It will be a lot easier for you to change yourself rather than try to change her. That doesn't mean you have to stop liking what you like though. Hopefully you two can meet in the middle.<br>  <br>  Tell her that you are proud of her for succeeding in the weight loss and that her accomplishment is an inspiration to you. Explain to her that even though she enjoys her weight loss, you kind of miss the curves that her body used to have. Let her know that she does not need to stay thin to impress you. Tell her right out that you would be very happy and very turned on if she put on another 10 pounds or so.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Has it ever occurred to you that she might be sick? Or possibly worn out from taking care of the baby? What you are stating is no different than a man complaining about a woman's weight gain after the baby and how he isn't attracted to her. Marriage is not superficial. It is made up of a bunch of components that don't involve physical attributes. Maybe she's anorexic and needs help? Try that one on for size. Talk with her. Get your head out of your butt and quit being so selfish. This isn't just about you.
SsCMH480aa	i don't think she does that because she doesnt like you...at present ur mom jus has her priorities mixed up.... she deosn't kno that as her child, you should be the most important thing to her......... she wants to be loved and thats why she spends all her time with her bf..... she will regret it later tho|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	that really breaks my heart but your your mom is a very selfish person.

Give her a guilt trip that you miss her, and that your getting older stuff like that
FnMH7tREaa	TAKE IT BACK!!!!!! she is just using you because you let her! she is getting all the benefits of having you as a boyfriend, and you are getting none of the benefits of even having a friend. save your money for something else don't waste it on someone who obviously doesn't appreciate what you do for her. and stop paying for her phone, especially if she is only calling you when she needs something.  i had a friend like that and i got rid of her, i am much happier now! you need to have friends that treat you as well as you treat them-that is true friendship, what you have with this girl is completely one-sided, she obviously doesn't care about you as a friend or she wouldn't treat you this way. it may be hard to do, but you should move on and find a girl that really likes you, not one that just uses you. good luck!|`|0A5Jtzqvaa	take them back, cancel the phone account or phone you got her as well and stop doing stuff for her.

She had her chance to accept your gift and she didn't. You being nice to her is just encouraging her that she can act like this around you and you won't do anything about it, you'll even keep paying for her things.<br>  <br>  Since it isn't too out of hand right now, cut back on what you give her but try to maintain your friendship. Maybe she'll realize that you can't pay for everything and blowing you off when you have a gift for her is rude.|`|PIrwKaNWaa	sorry but you should take it back and put your foot down. she might be pissy but get tje hint your not there to be use(which seems like you are)  seems like your her fall back or back up boy you know stop being so nice and treat her as you would everyone else....you will learn time heals and tells all just be strong hang in there and you;ll be moving on in no time GOOD LUCK!|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	take them back because if she nevers gets them--your out that money. I hate to say it, but I think she's using you for money.
naequcqlaa	Do yourself a BIG favor & do not act on your feelings.  There are just far too many others involved that would get hurt by it.  Knowing too that what goes around does in fact come back around & you would never be happy even if you did get together.  We cannot be happy if it's at other's expense.  I too well know, I've been there & unfortunately did go w/my feelings.  Not only did it break up two marriages, but in the end, ours also broke up in yrs. to come.  So everything that was done based on what you think you feel at this time would only end up hurting so many in the end.  Some things are better just left unsaid.  This is ONE of them.  Think of all those who would be hurt by just voicing your feelings.  NO, take it from someone who knows first hand that it just would NOT work.  The do unto others would just come back to you & slap you rite in the face so to speak.  This is just one thing you're going to totally have to keep to yourself & not let anyone know or even be aware of how you feel.  I'm a firm believer that things do happen for reasons.  There must have been a reason in the past just why you didn't get together either.  There must be just something that's keeping you apart for a reason that's unknown.  IF it were meant to be, I feel it would have happened a long time ago.  But, now is NOT the time for it either.  Just feel reassured that if it were meant to be, it would have been.  Somehow someway it just didn't happen.  Try your best to be friends in whatever way feels best for you.  Best to you...:)|`|ev33OxJbaa	Your dealing with your emotions and they cannot be trusted.

If the marriage has run its course and needs to end, so be it, but don't base that decision on whether your friend shares your fantasies or not.

I don't know how long you have been married, but no matter who you are in a relationship with, the spark fades.  <br>  <br>  You think you aren't in love with your husband, but you are wrong.  You've just gotten to that place that couples do from time to time.  You are bored and in a rut.  Talk to your husband and try to re-kindle your romance.  Do things you did when you first got married.<br>  <br>  DO NOT tell your friend how you feel.  You will be screwing up two marriages and affecting the lives of many.  Your friends and family suffer as well.  <br>  <br>  Marriage is hard work and so any people think it's supposed to be easy and stay wonderful and new forever.  It's hard and sometimes really sucks, but staying together and working thru the ruts are so worth it in the end.<br>  <br>  Get away from your friend and focus on your husband.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Wrong. You are so.....wrong. If you are unhappy in your marriage, then get a divorce before you start even thinking about getting involved in a relationship with another man.

Geez!<br>  <br>  <br>  If the marriage is that bad, then, get a divorce. Nothing's worth that.

I would disregard everyones answers who didn't know those details, though its still a bad idea to breakup your friends marriage because you're in an abusive relationship.  <br>  <br>  First, get out of the relationship with your husband now!  If your not strong enough, then do it for your daughters sake.  Otherwise she will seek out abusive men like your husband.  The bottom line is you deserve more, and you will find someone better.  And bring your daughter, if your husband has not changed by now he ISNT GOING TO.  Start a new life, in a year you will be amazed at how far you've come.  It's possible : ) <br>  <br>  My sincerest best to you and your daugter. <br>  <br>  -----------------------------<br>  <br>  Nobodys perfect.  The fact that you say that proves that you're seeing him as larger than life.  You're probably not viewing him realistically.  Think about what your actions would do to the other people involved.  Your husband, his wife, kids?  <br>  <br>  Why don't you & your current husband love each other?  To me thats the real issue.   Maybe it was a mistake to marry him, but you did and you have to live with that choice.  Sorry to sound like that, but its true.  Unless of course, hes abusive, alcoholic, or cheating on you which it doesn't sound like it.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, it sounds to me like you're just bored in your current relationship and rather than put the work into spicing it up, you'd rather abandon ship...which is too bad - if thats true please realize theres a high probability that exact same thing will happen with the new guy once you realize he isn't the mythologized version of perfection you thought.  It may not happen for 10+ years, but you will have ruined the lives of two or more people.  That sounds like a very selfish move to me.  <br>  <br>  Maybe I'm wrong, and life would be perfect...but in reality when you have to pay the bills and daily life settles, are you gonna be thinking of your other "other" best friend then?  Or even more sadly, your ex-husband?<br>  <br>  Stay strong, and good luck to you.  Don't listen to all the people preaching, just make sure you think it through for real long and hard before doing anything.|`|xnrGBXHcaa	The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence. If you left your husband and got together with him, will you be in the same condition with him that you are in now with your current husband after a period of time. When the new wears off, all relationships can get boring or predictable. You should honor your marriage and end your friendship with this person. You should question your judgement about having a male best friend anyway. <br>  <br>  You might think about the laundry list of people that will NOT look on you with favor for breaking your marriage vows. Such as members of your own family, your current husbands family, and your male friends wife and her family. I wonder if there are children involved? Your side or the male friends side. There will be alot of people hurt and alot of collateral damage. What you are doing is selfish. You had your shot with this male friend years ago and blew it.

Don't take what I say as a insult, as I am only telling you like it is for your own good, as many women, myself included have fallen like a ton of bricks for a guy other then their husband, out of sheer need for excitement. Many women tend to get caught up in this emotional roller coaster by their own actions, I believe that you are convinced that this is love your feeling by your own doing, but in reality this is not love, love takes time, love is built and created by two people who have shared good times and bad. No one can love another person while their married, they may think their in love but it is not really love, because when your married and having problems and are contemplating leaving or divorce, it takes many months or years to ever find clarity, as this process is quite draining and can leave many couples feeling lost, their is always a grieving process that follows a marital break up, so to say that while your married that your in love with someone else, is frankly insane, as you haven't even recovered or found clarity yet with your current marriage, to sum it up, you are putting the cart before the horse, so maybe you should be thinking about backing up a little bit here and stop thinking like a little school girl who just found her first boyfriend and be a adult woman. First things first, get some therapy, as you really sound quite confused, and as I already pointed out, I am not trying to insult you, I only want to help you, so before you make any rush decisions, get into therapy and do it fast.|`|Nwp3Ar9taa	It makes sense that you would feel this way if you have been married to the same person for years and then along comes the one who got away. <br>  <br>  Do you have children? Does he have children? How will your actions affect them? What about his wife? Your husband? <br>  <br>  You are obviously not a selfish person and I say that because you said you have not been "in love" with your husband for years, yet you have stayed with him. <br>  <br>  The devil has a way of making the grass appear greener on the other side of the fence, but once you cross that fence you will find out fast that everything that glitters is not gold. Try to remember what attracted you to your husband in the first place. Remember your first few dates, the first time you made love, things like that should help you realize that this recent infatuation is just because he someone from the past that was exciting then and he's exciting now, but beware because nothing gold can stay.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ma36UfpBaa	the grass isn't greener on the other side... it's greener where you water it! Whatever you do make sure it is repectable. We can't help our emotions sometimes, but we should never intentionally hurt others if we can help it!|`|9Ni21lHpaa	Oh for goodness sake!!!He's never talked to you about his wife??Well thats someone you'll get to hear abt when you'll become "the other woman" when he has an affair with you,which considering the fact that he's never told you about his wife means he probably will.....you dont even know "how deep beyond friendship"??what if you tell him what u feel and he tells you he loves his wife?how would that make you feel?dumb and cheap right?what if all he wants is a one night stand or a fling??whats going to happen to you after that,did u ever think about that??would you be able to live with yourself then?Being nothing more than a fling??...Im sorry its disgusting...do you really want to be "the other woman"??Think of your marriage and your kids if you have any....work on your relationship with ure husband,and stop seeing this guy...he's making you think of wrecking ure home....get over him|`|NsUmBGxLaa	I understand how you feel, I have a rocky marriage myself and quite a similar situation, very.  It sounds like you have given your husband years to GROW UP.  Some men never do.  Since you state he is abusive, be careful there.  Talk to your friend, and stress that you don't expect anything, tell him you are just trying to be honest with him.  It sounds like you need a good friend right now, but keep in mind that he is a "Friend".  Don't screw it up with a bunch of emotions that are causing you the confusion.  Good friendships are hard to find.  Always consider his wife in this too, maybe there is a reason the two of you have not talked about her.  Not that I am trying to add fuel, but maybe he just doesn't know how to tell you he has problems in his marriage as well.  Give this time, be friends and things will work themselves out if you are smart, careful of others feelings, and listen with you head as well as your heart.  Do try to find happiness in your life though, it is a nice thing to have.  I hope this helps.|`|ccCOyWq8aa	This is coming from someone who has been in the same boat you are...<br>  <br>  My advice would be to give A LOT of distance between yourself and your 'friend' that you're in love with! Remember why you married your husband in the first place. Many people will fall in and out of love throughout the course of their marriage.<br>  <br>  I was going through a rough patch with my husband when I fell for my best guy friend who I'd known from childhood! He was 'perfect' in every way and I couldn't imagine a day without him. That was until I found out that he was just like my husband (most men are).<br>  <br>  I then realized that I need to give my marriage a chance and I couldn't do that unless I removed this 'friend' from my life. I truly believe that it saved my marriage! I was literally days from filing for a divorce when I realized that what I was doing was wrong.<br>  <br>  Remember - the grass is NEVER greener on the other side of the fence, no matter how much you think it will be.<br>  <br>  Take the time to love your husband now while you can! You won't regret it.

If so then she will have to work on her self confidence to repair the damage he has done.<br>  <br>  If it is just because things have run their course then she can look back on the good times they shared and know it wasn't a waste of their time.

5qW4qnWTaa	If she takes tours often then why don't you ask if you can go with her, this will be like validating her word under the table without her knowing and your way to see if she is really going to this place because if she has she will tell you things like what's ahead or other stuff that she might think is interesting from the place. Don't jump to conclusions though because some things are not what they seem. There are many things that you can do to investigate things under the table without being to obvious, like for example: One day when she goes out on one of her meetings, call her best male friend and ask if he would like to go drink a coffee together or lunch or whatever so you can talk and go from there.|`|2eoAqicdaa	Yes you probally are... <br>  he's probally having a tour of this place of a meeting or something or just at a take away place picking some dinner up for you <br>  it could be anything... you have to trust him more x|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	go after him and see .. you will find him in a bar i guess|`|NGKwsawdaa	weird but that doesn't necessarily mean that they both are up to something, why don't you call your wife and see what she's up to and who's she with.

JtEBaOdjaa	You don't HAVE to have sex that night. You will at some point though.<br>  1. yes it hurts, not a lot though, and it gets easier every time though.  It's a different kind of pain, more of a soreness (like a sore muscle). Not a pain like being stabbed or punched. lol. No worries.<br>  2. there may be some bleeding, don't worry it's normal. It's just from your hyman.<br>  3. Whenever you do have your first time, spend LOTS of time kissing and massaging each other, it will really help you relax and the more relaxed your muscles are, the less pain there will be.<br>  4. Go buy some KY jelly.  The more lube you use on his penis, the easier it will be when he penetrates.<br>  5. Tell him to start with a couple fingers, so you can start to feel good, then when you are comfortable he can replace the fingers with his penis.<br>  <br>  Good luck! don't worry, sex is one of the most natural things in humanity.  Before you know it you'll want it every night cause it's so much fun!<br>  <br>  EDIT: don't worry, being scared AND excited is normal. It is definitely both scary AND exciting.  But don't feel bad if you get to the point and decide you aren't quite ready, that is fine too.  There is plenty you guys can do without actual intercourse. He'll understand!|`|sGP6s7uraa	Whoa whoa whoa.  You don't HAVE to have sex on your wedding night (you might be too tired from the day's activities) and plus, you don't want to feel pressured (if you are, you may not enjoy it).  If you and your husband practice enough foreplay (for you) then it shouldn't hurt.  It maybe  just a pinch discomforting.<br>  <br>  Just relax and try to enjoy yourself.  You don't have to do it immediately.  You can wait a few days (or even a few weeks) and just play around a bit until you are completely comfortable with having sex.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	You go Girl! <br>  <br>  You don't have to cause it's your wedding night and to be honest you gotta be relaxed or it will just be awkward.

Props to you!<br>  <br>  You don't have to have sex on your wedding night. But, if you do, it does hurt a little bit. Most commonly, the first time a woman has intercourse, her hymen is broken - which is a small section of skin. And the other poster is right... it's more like a sore muscle ache than a stabbing pain. And you do want to relax because tensed muscles will cause more aching type of pain. <br>  <br>  Just relax, and have fun! Sex is supposed to be fun, and it does come naturally. You'll be fine! =)|`|268fbadb7ead2c9b7c16ca2a28b85c7baa	i was a nervous as you are!!<br>  but don't worry, i mean when i had it by first time, i hurts a lot, but it was because i was very nervous and i was not getting relax, trust me,<br>  if you relax you won't feel it and eventually you will start enjoying it.

5s3uFazlaa	That's difficult.  I guess you should think to yourself is there anything that you would be gaining by being her friend again.  If not, let her know that she hurt you, and that it would be difficult to try and act like everything is OK when it's not.  Don't feel bad, a similar situation happened to me.  When I thought back, I realized that the girls never were very nice to me in the first place. It was hard to lose them, and I even cried a little, but it was for my own good.

Don't tell her anything personal, don't go out of your way to spend time with her.

What I would suggest is this: Let her know respectfully but directly that you were hurt by her previous actions but are willing to forgive and forget, provided she doesn't do the same thing again. Let her know that if she does, she will have permanently severed your friendship. Hopefully she will come to her senses and become a better friend and person.|`|Qz4n1l0zaa	only time will tell. ive had all kinds of experiences with girls ive been cool with since kindergarten and i still consider them my friends. sometimes friends go through those extremes because they are tests. <br>  <br>  experiences include: backstabbing, fall outs, near physical fights, tons of arguments and disagreements, two faced situations, jealousy of friendship, etc.|`|0A5Jtzqvaa	yup, she is on the rebound and since the other ditched her she went back to you.

She will be with you until she finds another "better" friend to be with.|`|Oq7CAayZaa	using you..........never take back friends that dump you!|`|lvqrtRoVaa	Wow, well first of all, I hate when people label people. For example, you just said that she went & hung out with a 'popular' girl but unless you're in grade 6/7/8 no one calls them popular people anymore. They are not everything.<br>  <br>  Second of all, you just quoted 'But she is a friend,' so I don't really get why you should say 'Should I reconsider her friendship? because to me, it sounds like you already have. <br>  <br>  Thirdly, I don't think that you should become really close with her again because you will find many friends in you're life, but some are just BS, & just want to start crap that is not needed. So, no I don't think that you should become really close with her, but I do think that you should still be her friend, but its hard to forgive someone who would ditch you for someone else. <br>  <br>  Fourthly, did she apologize to you for doing what she did? If so, than that shows that she cared enough to say sorry & wants to still be you're friend. If not, than she is just another person that you want to stay away from. Or, if she thinks that she didn't do anything wrong, or she didn't seem to notice this problem, than you should have talked to her about it. <br>  <br>  Fifthly, if you think she cares about you & you are willing to forgive her and accept her as a friend again, than there should be no problem. Its you're choice of what kind of friends you want in life, & what kind you don't want to hang around. I don't think you should be her 'bff' anymore, but just be her friend. Maybe after a few months you'll get to know how she really is, & if you like how she is than you should still be her friend & become very close, but I'm pressuming that you have other friends whom care about too & wouldn't ditch you for others. <br>  <br>  Sixthly, in you're life you will meet A LOT of new people & some you won't like, but some you will just grow up to love & they will do so right back. You don't need somone who in the long-run will be like: 'Oh, well... I'm just going to hang out with those people because you're pissing me off," you need someone who you KNOW will always be there for you, & never leave your side. <br>  <br>  Anyways, I said everything I need to say. Now its up to you. What kind of friends do you really need? <br>  <br>  Hope I helped,<br>  <br>  =).
R6TFrDtxaa	You are the adult. You are right. He will thank you later. Don't worry you are being a GREAT dad!!|`|hQmZP38qaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  This is no way make you a bad father.  What if he girlfriend decides one day that she doesn't want to be with him and accuses him of raping her at her house.  I don't know why that girls parents even allow him to stay the night with their daughter in their house.  That is more wrong than what you did and said to him.  <br>  <br>  If he wants to be on his own, then let him find a place of his own with his own job and make his own decisions.  <br>  <br>  You have done the best you can in raising your son and learning and teaching him the right and wrong ways.<br>  <br>  In reality, the girls parents are wrong for allowing this to happen in their home.  You should protect him in case she claims that he raped her.  Girls now a days are very spiteful, so just be care full an let him know about the consequence to his actions and behaviors.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you out and have a blessed weekend.|`|dcf6b9a48887396c1f8f5a58eb29d68aaa	I dont think you should let this get to you.<br>  <br>  No your not a bad father, you did what you belive is right for him, as you well know, hes young and doesnt know what the world is about as much as you have experienced in contrast to him. <br>  <br>  Sounds to me like hes just your average teen, hotheaded due to hormones and pissed that he cant get his way, thats just the way the world is mack, not your fault.<br>  <br>  Dont worry though, he will come around in the next 3-5 years as long as you keep a level head and stick to it.|`|GxapFaqtaa	sounds like you failed as a parent, if he treats you like this. Also sounds like he has really bad friends. Where the hell were you while he was growing up! IN the PUB, I think!!!!!!!!!<br>  Now to cure this problem BOX his ears for talking to you like this. YOU ARE THE FATHER, NOW ACT LIKE A MAN AND TAKE PROPER CONTROL OF THIS SITUATION. How I hear you ask, It's simple..... Explain so that he understands WHY. you ALWAYS need to explain in detail. <br>  It's not against any human right, his age give him the human right to make an *** of himself.<br>  Best of luck, sound like you need to explain the birds and the bees.|`|DCwGQDO9aa	You would be a bad father to agree to let him spend the night.  If your not going to get mad when he pops up with the "my girlfriends pregnant" speak then stick to your guns because that's all it can lead to.|`|83zrT0i6aa	Great father, troublesome but naturally defiant and wanton kid.  Same old story, but you are right.  Don't let him sleep over.  Age on consent in most states is 18.|`|c52c780b69eb4e6373e1f3123cb1f3bbaa	Well you've certainly made some mistakes if your son talks to you like that! What the hell's wrong with you|`|lPyhhmRAaa	Nope, you are a GOOD father. You are being responsible and that's what society needs - good on you :)|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	top dad. whether youre right or not, soo hard. I feel your pain. good luck|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Nope, makes you a good father.|`|zQB0kEmcaa	It sounds like you are a very caring and attentive father.  However if he wants to 'be' with his girlfriend he will do it whatever the time of day it is so you might as well let him sleep over.  At least he will be in a home environment and not on the streets or in the back of a car.  Just be thorough in your explanation of relationships, sex, STDs etc.....|`|Eug52iQDaa	Your son just showed his level of maturity.  He's obviously not ready to be making those decisions if he curses at you and storms out.  <br>  <br>  That said, remember that growing up, and especially the late teens are almost impossible for kids.  He's a kid today and grown up tomorrow.  Gradual release of responsibility to him to let him get used to decision making is necessary for him to be a well-adjusted adult.  <br>  <br>  He still shouldn't be spending the night at his girlfriend's house.  I'm with you!|`|4uB0bbhnaa	no,off course you are not a bad father,you are a responsible dad<br>  and your son isn't a bad son,because he is telling you the truth<br>  <br>  he could easily have told you he was staying over at a mates<br>  <br>  At 17, he is still young,but then again if he has been with his girlfriend a while then its probably quite acceptable nowadays<br>  <br>  Just explain to him that you don't want to be a grandfather just yet and that's why you are not keen on him staying over<br>  <br>  I have 3 sons, youngest 18, and I've been through this situation <br>  several times<br>  Reassure him that you love him and have his best interests at heart|`|7PbJWEo1aa	Your his father however he can do what he likes. My parents didnt let me until I was 18 and then I moved out and aint gone back since!<br>  <br>  You've got to get a balance and calmly explain the situation from your point of view. <br>  <br>  He doesn't have to ask your permission HOWEVER have you spoken to the girlfriends parents? If you say to them - "I'm not happy" they might pervent it from happening too.<br>  <br>  United front!|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Well no your a good parent trying to protect him I was stupid when i was younger i wanted the same thing and you know what you can tell him no but he might just sneak out any ways. You have to watch him closely, also tell him if he is going to have sex you and him have to go to the store and buy condoms and be a little loud while your in the store about it making comments. You sure your thing is big enough for that type? You sure you don't want the prelubercated ones? You want thin or thick? You want it for her os his pleasure? Just make it hell and he will yes get pissed off but if he goes and leaves and doesn't buy them tell him he isn't grown up enough to buy them or think about the safety issue in sex he has no need to have sex. Also tell him once he is 18 he can make choices and if he gets a girl pregnant he better pack his s*** and get the f*** out of your house. I know it will be hard but you have to be hard on this issue allot of stupid mistakes out there that happen and we have to live with them and they do weight us down.<br>  Your doing a good job all i have to say is keep it up bud.|`|e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	Hi there it sounds like normal teenage stuff, been there done it myself, i would say if this is a regular girlfriend he has, maybe talk to the girlfriends mother and find out what she thinks about the idea,of your son staying over, and also if the girlfriend is on any type of birth control, speak to your son man to man and make sure that he knows the importance of contraception, if he wants to be treated like an adult then these are things he will have to think about, if he wants to be treated like an adult,and if hes nearly 18 soon he will soon be the age when you say hes not a child, and then he will be wondering why hes still being treated like a child,you could avoid him staying at the girlfriends but threes still a chance that they could have unprotected sex somewhere else at some other time so make sure he knows what he is doing. <br>  I would also have a serious talk about the language issue as he should`nt fly off the handle and treat you like this just because he isn't getting his own way, you are the boss and until he learns to behave like an adult he does not deserve to be given the privilege of staying at anyones house.<br>  Speak to your son and your sons girlfriends parents and make your decision from there really i do not see any problems with him staying at his girlfriends as long as they are both sensible and the girlfriends parents know the situation too.<br>  But good luck and hes just a normal teenager trying to become a man.|`|iRXraQWyaa	To be honest, I personally think that a 17 year old should have the choice to stay with his girlfriend.  However, it depends on how old the girl is, and how long the relationship has been going on for etc.  If she is say 17 and they have been going for say 2 years then why not?  If it is a very new relationship and she is under 16, then that's a different story. <br>  <br>  I think you have to let your children grow up, and as long as he/they are sensible then they should be able to spend time together.  When he is eighteen he can do what he wants, and that is probably not that far away.|`|hfr9rLjkaa	Nope your a good father..But you do know that your son and his girlfriend are only gonna end up doing it in a bush! And if you do let him stay maybe they wont have to think right lets just have a baby to get a place off the council then no one can tell us when we can have sex!!! Letting him stay might make them more adult about it...They wont rush into the whole thing if you let them have there way! xx|`|AA12050428	How sad!  No you are not a bad father you sound like a very good and sensible one. Human rights shouldn't come into it, he is still Living in your home and is theoretically your responsibility,|`|YM1zhtKEaa	You are not a bad father  Live in my house eat my food live by my rules  .If you don't like it get out get a job make your own rules|`|QKs0PFVpaa	I'm 20 years old, and your demands dont sound too unreasonable.<br>  <br>  He probably wants to sleep with her, so good that he cant stay over. no one wants grandkids now do you!|`|4oDn5zIpaa	No he will come around but if you were my dad and he was my brother there is no way he would even talk to you like that.|`|vZMN82U8aa	stand your ground dad... kids need to learn they dont always get what they want... dads house, dads rules... <br>  <br>  and id be phoning her parents and ask what they think theyre playing at... if their daughter wants to be a tart, thats fair enough, but... its not sending a message of responsibility is it?|`|be0YaDUPaa	Tough age.  There is nothing wrong with forbidding your child from spending the night at their bf/gf house.   It really comes down to what you've allowed so far, how close to 18 he is, how rebellious he is, how dependent on you he is, etc. as to whether you can really control much of his behavior anymore.  If he's just going to be mad for a few days but ultimately respect your authority, then great.  Him being mad for a few days or even a couple of weeks isn't the end of the world.  If he's going to do it anyway then come home like nothing happened, then your options are limited.  Maybe you can kick him out if he refuses to obey your rules, but nobody really wins in that case.  You can take away car keys, not pay for gas/insurance, etc. as punishment.  He may or may not respect that.  Or you can just be disappointed and accept that he's going to start doing his own thing and that you really don't have much of a say.|`|xW5q1EXraa	well im 14 and my parents are strict they do regard me as a child we may have our fights but secretly i know they are telling me this with all of there best intentions even if it may sound unfair i still know my parents know best.<br>  <br>  so even if your son is angry at you when hes older you'll just laugh but as long as you have a good reason behind the argument you are always wanting the best from your son and you have a responsibility he is growing up now and almost an adult now so it is normal hes going to want to retaliate now and again but you are still his dad and he has to understand you want the best for him.<br>  <br>  I hoped this helped and your problem should be over soon thanks!|`|RDZzKsflaa	It doesn't make you a bad father at all. You're simply trying to take care of your son.<br>  <br>  But maybe you should let him have her over to your house, compromise. Because then you can keep an eye on them and you won't feel worried.<br>  <br>  In my advice, I wouldn't continue the argument when he comes back, because it's better to let it go after he's cooled down. Don't harp on about it when he comes back.<br>  <br>  I hope it helps to have the perspective of somebody young like your son. Good luck.|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	it makes no difference if he is 17 or 27 while he lives under your roof he should live by your rules if he does not like it then he should move out. to be honest letting him stay at his girlfriends don't seem that bad but if you had a problem with her staying under your roof then you have a right to say no.Also whether you let him sleep out or not it wont stop them sleeping together if they are going to do it they will no matter how strict you are i tried to put my foot down with my daughter and she left home at 16 to live with her boyfriend now she is back home still 16 and 5 months pregnant.|`|cu8fUJbMaa	We raised four teens and our policy was always, "Our house, our rules." When one of them decided to rebel and not follow the rules, they were lovingly invited to get themselves a job and rent themselves an apartment and create their own rules. LOL  ALL kids that age try to demand their rights and convince you that you're a crappy parent for not letting them do what they want. That's the whole point of parenting....to teach,to guide, to advise, to protect......and that's exactly what you're doing. Keep doing it!|`|j7HeuFeVaa	Hmmm, how old is his girlfriend? If she's under 17 then i completely agree with you. He is right that he is legally allowed HOWEVER until he is 18 he is your responsibility and whatever you think is right should go and he does have to abide to your rules.<br>  To your question, no i do not think you're a bad father, he'll calm down soon enough :)|`|F6xRVFVUaa	no, you're not a bad father but understand that your son is growing up and needs some personal space. He may be under 18, but emotionally and physically he is becoming a young man, and as a teenager myself, the more you restrict a teen, the more you will push them away.|`|tw1uePBbaa	your house your rules and age of consent only means he can sleep with her-which it doesnt really sound like he is mature enough to be doing if he still throws a fit like that.  until he is 18 and ready to move out he should have to respect and abide by your rules|`|FJXWanpAaa	im 17 too, only im a girl lol.<br>  I dont think your a bad father at all for doing that!<br>  I see it as you protecting him from getting himself in a mess i.e. getting his gf pregnant.<br>  I think it is responsible of you and he should look up to you and he should realise you are only trying to do whats best.|`|x7z0z0kwaa	i really shouldn't be telling you if your a bad father because i think its rude.  technically you are correct in that he is under age, but i would still offer to say he could go over to hers during the day. hope it works out.|`|JUEkTETAaa	you are a good father not to knock his lights out or to whip that a**...you are never to old for that..and you are great dad..tell him to get a job and he can go live where ever he wants but your door will always be open|`|2SKd9996aa	Nope, you're a good father! You are 100% right in what you said to him. As long as he is under 18 and living in your house, he must follow your rules.|`|LC3TGSr3aa	Of course not. <br>  Maybe he wasn't really planning to do anything but sleep over there but you can never be too safe when it comes to keeping your son safe.|`|AA12397473	You have rules he should abide by them and your beliefs.<br>  In another sense has his girlfriends mother agreed to the sleep over.?|`|Ua1OiWmbaa	You're a great father, in time he will see that and be thankful that you care about him.|`|fox5a3ePaa	No it makes you totally normal

You can create and decorate a nice alter at home and have a civil judge come out and marry you in your home. You can make it a small family gathering and your closes friends, it will be more romantic and more wedding like then to go to a cold court house or a slutty Vegas chapel because remember anything can happen in Vegas.|`|tVQbd5MGaa	I got married in Vegas and it was Fabulous. We went down to the grand canyon for part of our honeymoon in a convertible. We stayed in the Bellagio Hotel in Vegas and got 50 photos and a DVD as part of our wedding package.

5s3uFazlaa	That is mean.  You should talk to her privately, like over the phone, about how you feel when she does that.  explain to her the situation and make sure that you tell her that you felt like crying.  Girls always know that when crying is involved, it's real emotion that is showing through.  If you don't feel comfortable telling her that, then bring it up as a joke when they are talking about it.  like "hey...how come i wasn't at this event...you know that I love (whatever they did) too." see what they say, maybe they thought you would be busy are wouldn't be allowed to go.|`|cDjWONryaa	Ok.. So to begin with we don't do things in our lives to get something back.  Or at least we are not supposed to be motivated by that.  So what ever you did for your "FRIEND" was out of kindness on your part.  Now whether or not she decideds to return the kindness is strictly up to her and in reality she doesn't owe you anything in return.  Would it be considerate and of her to return the kindness yes.<br>  <br>  On the other hand you may be the type of person that gives in the friendship in hopes of making it stronger. I don't know your personal history or how popular you are verses the other girls but sometimes we do things hoping to gain an upper or extra foot up in a friendship when it is someone that we really want to be friends we. I guess kind of like "BUYING THEIR FRIENDSHIP" and in reality this is not something you want to do.  You need to find friends that like you for who you are and what you share in common not what you can do for them.<br>  <br>  And if this girl could possibly be doing the same thing with the other girl that is making your jealous somewhat.  Maybe that other girl is talking your friend into doing the things she is doing and the other girl is more popular than your friend so she has taken advantage of a situation for popularity and what comes with it.  <br>  <br>  Its very hard to say since I don't know how old you are or your status as far as social peers are concerned.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can tell you is be yourself and if it hurts then its not GOOD FOR YOU!!!|`|Qz4n1l0zaa	next time they do that playfully be like "uh hello! what about me?"<br>  <br>  either that or start hanging out with some of your associates more|`|m8C8MU2Maa	Yea it's mean and very inconsiderate of both of them.  You need new friends and put them behind you.  Remember how they made you feel and don't ever do the same.  That's really cold.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Ask them why they always do stuff together and not with you. Tell them how you feel because if you don't how else are they going to know?
Du8MYqwDaa	Well it all depends on the type of guy he is. Some guys are very independent and they don't always like it when you overwhelm them with emotions/love/etc. If you guys usually talk everyday, and he hasn't said anything about the e-mail after 2 days, then that either means that he is freaked out and doesn't know what to do about it, or he doesn't want to be with you and is trying to ignore you. I mean there could be the off chance that he hasn't read it yet because of work, but I doubt it. I know it hurts to hear, but I've been there too where you put your heart out on the line and the other person just doesn't care. I would say since you've done what you've done and there's no going back.....you should focus on whats next and you should try to heal and start hanging out with friends and doing things to keep you busy (so you can stop thinking about him). <br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|ldqQDwI4aa	You done right!<br>  Wait a day or 2 then if he doesn't call you, ring him!|`|1k6UUC8qaa	personal things like that should not be discussed via e mail for all you know his x wife could have access to his e mail read it and erased it. you should have told him in person or at least over the phone|`|PTshTOSUaa	try calling then if he doesnt answer or call back you'll know he was scared away.|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	I'm sorry that you are hurting.  Dry your tears,  you had to tell him how you were feeling.  You can't build a relationship if you can't express your self.

Otherwise it just ends up all confusing and messy, with neither person knowing where the relationship stands.  If you telling him how you feel scared him off, then maybe he isn't ready to be in a serious relationship with you (or anyone) right now.|`|nGdH31Ucaa	i agree with gabby.<br>  <br>  sometimes i look back on my last relationship<br>  and wonder if i should have done anything different.. <br>  should have tried being more like his ex that he left<br>  me to go back to.<br>  <br>  but in the end, i was myself and i was open about<br>  how i felt and i didn't stop myself from loving him <br>  with all my heart.<br>  <br>  and that is always the best way to go.<br>  <br>  why would you want to hide or pretend something<br>  that isn't real?<br>  <br>  however this works out,  you will be fine! promise.
AorhZF06aa	what? forgive and forget.|`|4b7598fb11241e3ead2dd43bfb020adcaa	No. I don't think he should. A true friend doesn't steal and especially don't lie about it. To be friends with someone you should be able to trust them and be honest with each other. In your cousins friends case, he totally disrespected him.|`|ruLqEgsuaa	Learn how to spell before you ask questions. WOW, JUST WOW|`|T7qgrOJzaa	No, his friend is a thief and no friend at all. He should stop being friends with someone who has no respect for him.|`|56n8oUvjaa	No. once a theif always a theif. I don't know where this kid was raised, or what kind of parents he has but i don't think he will stop stealing. Tell your cousin to forget about this punk.

I found this great site — <a href="http://my-song.ca/s/bdo1!" rel="nofollow">http://my-song.ca/s/bdo1!</a> You go on and make a personalized song — I did it for my best friend’s birthday. I had a great time putting the song together. It’s completely personalized, and so cute! It’s something I know she won’t forget for a long time.|`|9PCY2ScMaa	Well it depend on what your budget is but for my friends birthday i got them a present for every year, so like get him 18 small presents that link to inside jokes and stuff, or just get him a small present for every year you have known each other as it will probs be cheaper, like if you have known him for 5 years buy him 5 presents linking to stuff you have done, etc<br>  hope it helps xx|`|aSxMpaF8aa	too mark a special birthday I would go for a piece of jewellery, Silver or gold whatever the budget can cope with.
06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	If he is telling you to go for it and have a long distance relationship then he is not as into you as you are into him. No guy in love or thinking he wants to spend his life with you would tell you to go.<br>  So you should think on that. My own opinion is you should go to Australia. Your life is just beginning.|`|Z2zTCqkZaa	maybe austrailia can wait another year or two so that you guys are so serious that there is no doubt in his mind weather or not he should go.|`|LSMrAfzYaa	What do you want more? Australia? Or your 'Amazing Bloke'?<br>  <br>  Im my opinion long distance relationships do not work, but it is entirely your choice. What are you going to Australia for? Is it just because you dream of being there, or is it because you liked it when you was there and now think you want to live there permanently? <br>  <br>  Also if this man loves you and wants to be with you he will respect your wishes unless he is adamant that he will not move outside of the UK.<br>  <br>  :)|`|AA10267825	If you just started it...it's not serious.<br>  <br>  If you don't think he'd come with you...It's not serious.<br>  <br>  Just go!

And if that dose not work then ask your self would I rather follow my dream or go for the guy cuz remember there is more than one guy out there and It is your choice.|`|czPzAuSAaa	It depends on what you want more: your relationship with this man or life Down Under.  <br>  <br>  Forget about the long distance thing.  It never works.|`|hl6lhuuTaa	sorry but i would ditch him and move to austrlia , i  used to live in aus now i live in sunny old scotland haha   <br>  anyways there are soo many fit tanned guys in aus
iHVU9Ffpaa	try to work it out take  a break from each other for a while|`|838VJJGvaa	Why would you be happy with someone who you don't get along with.  Talk it over with him and if he doesn't wanna be serious or just changes the subject break up before he does.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220131831AA2seHj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|RvSHQtrXaa	Yes, you are fighting too early.  Your guy is not articulate though.  In time like this, if you do not want to part, speak to someone of reputability.  Why not change the usual environment?  Go to some where exciting or adventurous or just new.<br>  <br>  Do things different.  It seems your life is getting quite boring.  Boredom cause many lovers to sever relationships.  Go somewhere fun loving like a zoo, a park, or even church.  Perhaps both in the church under some guidance will make your life fullfilling, especially if both of you are engaged in Christian activities and even choice of the pastor have you in a righteous position.  <br>  <br>  Please, it seems your life is getting quite boring.  Do something.|`|W1hm3SnGaa	Me and my boyfriends had that trouble. We've been together for nearly 3 years, it's quite rare when we argue but when we do we are both really harsh, but still make up really quickly!<br>  It's actually good for a relationship to have arguments then you know each others other side and so on.<br>  <br>  So no, it's not to early, everyone argues|`|7uGMyGn2aa	No - i think ure doing pretty well! A relationship is not a healthy one unless couples argue - u need to do it else the other will realise wot they r doing annoys the other person. It helps make the relatiosnhip stronger, and if u make up that quick and easy it dosent really sound like ure relationship has any problems! =D|`|3ijLQe5laa	move on|`|AorhZF06aa	move on|`|Xc8dd6t4aa	Every couple argues.  I would say, as long as the issues are getting resolved and you apologize for things that you say and later regret, you shouldn't be too worried.  I have to say, my husband and I argue.  A lot.  We always have.  But we always make up.  And I wouldn't have it any other way.  Sometimes people try too hard not to argue in a relationship, and they end up with poor communication, pushing issues away until they just explode.  At least with a couple that argues, the issues are being presented and solved.  Maybe not in the best way possible, but the makeup sex is great.|`|u0eTvggDaa	Yelling, and arguing are normal in a relationship, it's perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  But yeah at times it just feels like that's all y'all ever do anymore.<br>  <br>  y'all seem to be happy and have a good relationship, it's just those dumb arguments that get in the way.<br>  <br>  just next time before y'all are about to argue about it, just think to yourself if it's actually worth getting upset over.|`|ON7F1YRsaa	It's probably OK. If you two feel bad about arguing and make up quickly, then it's just normal couple bickering. The fact that you both really care for each other shows that you two have lasting potential. Hey, sometimes its good to fight just for the make up sex :)|`|AA11982696	Your relationship sounds a lot like mine. I have been with my bf over a year and we argue and yell sometimes. Its not to early and EVERYONE fights in relationships. You both love eachother but sometimes arguing is involved. Dont worry everything will be okay.|`|AA11346438	first off, a year is not too early. nearly everyone has spats, but if you're at the point where you're shouting at each other and saying things you don't mean then you should both examine more deeply what's going on and make the necessary changes.|`|5MuTwO6naa	sounds normal to me.you need to argue to clear the air once in a while,so don't worry you and your partner are in the land of the normal people.be happy.|`|WeSdUJy9aa	I've seen this happen alot.  Sometimes if things are going well, you find little things to fight about.  Almost like you are worried that things are too good...like there has to be a catch.  Just talk to each other about it when you're not in the middle of an argument.  Then you can figure out ways to communicate better without letting it escalate into a fight.  Also remember not to take stress out on each other.  It's hard to do when you spend so much time with someone.  Most importantly, remember that all couples argue and it's normal.  It's comparable to growing pains.  You just need to find a way to cool down and not let it get to the yelling stage.  Good luck.|`|VUYX2zlLaa	Fighting is never fun. No one ever enjoys fighting, especially with someone they care about. But everyone does fight eventually, and I don't believe there is really a set date to start fighting. Actually, the fact that you're fighting, and getting over it and moving on so quickly is a good thing. Learning to forgive eachother so early on in your relationship will strengthen it for the future. It would be a bad thing if everything in your relationship was perfect for a long time, and then later on things started to go south. Arguing is natural, and what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. (AKA what doesn't kill your relationship makes it stronger). Good luck!|`|hGWhzfFqaa	If you're dating a year and you're fighting everything's normal. It's completely okay to fight and bicker. And if you're fighting constantly it's just a rough patch and all you need a bit of space. You'll be fine.|`|03M8UrkRaa	well you can ask this advice at jamrie.com<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!

There is NOTHING wrong with you, love. It's what you prefer, so don't let anyone think you're weird or racist because of it.    We get stares and dirty looks all the time, but it's just what I prefer. No one ever says anything when a black man says he prefers white women, so I dont get the double standard.    Love is love. No matter the race.|`|3HhhHWd4aa	Nothing is wrong with you.|`|ba11546863a841cea0081f35f682a3ccaa	you never tell us why dont you like black man..its kinda weird because you come from the same race..

s6stLtvLaa	You have to bear in mind that this is an emotional time for him.  When I first found out I was HIV+ my husband and I had just gotten married and discovered I was pregnant (last February).  I spent the first month pushing him away, trying to get him to leave.  I was scared he wouldn't be able to handle the pressure.  Then he said the one thing that made me realize he was in it for the long gaul.  He said even if we had known about the HIV before he proposed, he still would have married me.  That made all the difference to me.  Since I was pregnant I didn't really get my "break down"  2 months after my son was born I had my break down.  Now, almost 2 months later I am still struggling.  You have to be ready for an emotional roller coaster ride.  Some days he will be fine, others he will be a wreck and push you away.  Are you ready for this?  Do you think you can face the possibility of having HIV 2 or 3 years down the road?  Can you handle this for the rest of your life?      My suggestion (if you are serious about pursuing this relationship) is to do some research and get some statistics.  Show him that you two can still build a life and a family together.  Then, give him some breathing room.  Let him sort this out, but let him know you are close by, and let him know you are not going anywhere, no matter how much he pushes you away.  You are the one who gets to make the choice about what is best for your future, not him.  I am so grateful for my husband and my baby boy every day.  Without them, I would not have made it through my first year.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	i think you should BOTH go to counselling ..... HIV is a horrid virus and i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy  BUT it can be controlled by meds ... its not like it was 20 years ago when it was an instant death sentence|`|ep8iy5YNaa	dont stay in the relationship. i think you will regret it. sorry sweetie|`|vtm8lpFDaa	First, you should get yourself tested right away.    Second, if he didn't catch it when he was with you (in other words, if he didn't cheat on you), and like you said if you don't care because you love him so much, then stick with him. I'm sure he'll need all the care he can get. But please make sure you are Very Well Protected. I don't even know how that would work.    This must be a very tough time for him and for you. But you also have to prepare yourself for the unthinkable. And keep in mind that if you have decided to stick with him, you have to be commited to the task. Don't ditch him halfway. I'm pretty sure he'll change the way he socializes and he will become more and more depended on you.    If available, you two might benefit from counseling. I know if I'm in that situation I would need it. Good luck.|`|YE0baNYRaa	its a sweet move that u want to go ahead of this relationship. but i think your bf is right.. ull be ruining your life. and its not socially acceptable at all. think practically. you can always provide moral support to tim always as h\e is ur love. think over it again|`|hrdChmu9aa	leave him or die|`|d8d8uYDLaa	explain that to him. tell him you are there to support him and you love him enough to stay with him especially in a hard time like this. thats great that you love him enough to stay with him even though hes HIV positive|`|Hbf5G8C9aa	how old are you?? i only ask as if this is your first relationship the feelings can be so intense - do you think you will be emotionally strong enough for this.

Wish You Both A GOODLUCK for ur future.|`|P5GhUEvoaa	I feel sad hearing this.  But you first have to make sure that you're HIV negative first.  If you truly believe he's  good guy then accompany him,make him happy,he'll need a lot of attention and the feeling of being loved.  But I don't suggest you to have sex with him,whatever protection you guys use.I don't recommend it at all.Just avoid sex. You can show affection without it.  It's going to be hard for you,but love conquers all.  Wish you good luck! take care :)

ichMg9g2aa	Have you thought that perhaps sex just isn't one of those thing's he's 100% into? Just because it's natural for us to have sex, doesn't mean you have to be at it like a rabbit. My boyfriend and I have sex like once a week tops, and we're happy with our relationship.    Has he always been like this, or is it only recently? If he's always been like this, then it could be an after-effect of something that happened to him earlier on in life.    Explain to him how YOU'RE feeling. He might not actually realise, despite all the teasing etc. that you actually want some intimate time with him. Maybe by saying that you want to "feel close/intimate" instead of saying that you want to "have sex" might help him understand your needs as well.    Good luck :)|`|WWNWtzvDaa	tell him to make more of an effort ...a relationship is about give and take ...i dont feel like sex AT ALL with my fella ..but i still have now and again =)|`|e1GCbGrXaa	http://www.google.ie/search?q=foods+incr...|`|DYiQtwMJaa	i think that he needs to see a doctor.....mean no offence|`|ltUzwXZEaa	Once a week is not to much to ask but I think that you guys should go to the doctor and tell him of this trouble because it could really be something that can be corrected.He just may need some meds. or something.|`|m5aenb6qaa	you need to assess his situation, maybe he is always tired or stressed from work.

Probably but no ones know it and thats why we go into relationship to study and observe and then take the decision.    _K_|`|AG3dYL84aa	Sasha the best answer is when you realize you can't see your future without him.   You can't even think it any other way.  You love the whole him not just parts and anything he does for you gives you the good shivers.    When you don't feel this way then you will start to fall out when you get more serious in a relationship.  Be careful, though, because sometimes you think you are falling out but you're just going through a normal relationship lull (you just need a little shake up).  So you break up with him and then a few weeks later you realize that you made a terrible move.  Chances are you won't get him back.  The best way to deal with this is to get away from him, and pretend you've already done this.  That usually will tell you.  Good luck.
hH1lWHL4aa	If you still want her back, go.. Just ensure that you know the worst case scenario: You fall deeper, she doesn't feel a thing, you go in for a kiss, and she rejects you.

8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Its in a lot of people isnt it, 'When you get what you want, will you want what you get?'    I think people enjoy the thrill of the chase and actually find the chase is more exciting than the actual person/their relationship with the person.    Its sad in a way really cos there can be so much joy and fun in a relationship, and if people put the same effort into a relationship as they did into the chase, well the sky's the limit!    The other thing is to consider whether or not there is any fear involved, or any insecurity, or any hurts from the past that you have not dealt with that prevent you from taking the plunge and being willing to take time and the effort to enjoy a relationship with someone.    Remember - good relationships are 'made' they dont just happen.   Like everything, it has to be looked after and maintained to be in top condition - if you did not put fuel in your car it wouldn't work and you wouldn't forget to service it every year, even more important is the time spent on making a relationship work!    Hope this has not made you run to the hills haha!       Whether or not there is a label for 'kind of behaviour' who knows, but who wants a label eh.    Take care and all the best to you, AND remember happiness is the journey and not the destination.|`|EENUWAP7aa	The Ego is the biggest portion of any person's will and anticipation towards what ever they choose.    For example> A male meets a young lady at a Donut Shop. She smiles and he just looks at her and say's to himself, wow, she's cute.    He asks if she has anybody and to his asking she say's no.    They go on a date and he doesn't want to mess anything up, but in the back of his mind he anxiously awaits to have sex and his anticipation has raised his level of excitement at least 10 times the feeling and this causes him to say things and do things with her waiting for the word yes I want to sleep with you.    Now they go to a Motel room and it's time to see what happens next.     This is what happens...he becomes the Bull and drives all his energy into that one sexual session.    When it's over he wakes up in the bed with her in the Motel and she leans over and lays her arm on his chest and cuddles and say's she feels so good.    Now in his mind he is saying, well it's over and I don't want to pursue this anyfurther.    Who's talking here the guy or his hormones?    The answer is his hormones. Once he released all his adrenaline, his testosterone levels change and so does his endorphins and the mental state of mind is not as exctied as before.     Before sex last night he was ten times the amount in anticipation...after sex he dropped from a level 10 to a level 2.    The sex calms the savage beast and leaves nothing else to ravage.    It's like a Tornado that rips through your house and takes it all and leaves you the left overs.    When a man does this to a woman, she gets her feelings hurt. She may begin to look at Men as pigs. She may not trust another guy again.    She likes him so much, but she doesn't want to be hurt because she knows if she opens those legs too early, he's just another Tornado.|`|1kfeghDDaa	The key is to find EXCITEMENT everyday with what you already HAVE!!

So women are seen to be in their "prime" at younger ages... and men at much older age.    However... physically- I think guys are most attractive in their young 20's: 20- 24. Guys are generally fit without most effort. Their stamina is at its peak. They're simply beautiful.    Of course, both men and women can stay fit and  beautiful as they get older- and we tend to chose our lovers based on many things: intelligence, charm, wisdom...

I don't think there is a specific upper age limit (let's not consider the lower limits because that will extend to the opposite sex having deadly bacteria on their lips days, and we didn't think about sexual attraction back then), because attraction doesn't just come from a person's body or face. You can be attracted to a person's voice, the way they speak, how they carry themselves and treat others, their charm, intellect, etc. Some of these things come with time, and so in my opinion, you're still in the game even if you've passed a certain unmentionable age.  Seriously...there's no point in being in your physical "prime" at whatever age if you're nothing but a shell. There are plenty of younger guys who are so cocky and confident about their looks, but can be considered mindless and hideous by their actions.     (In this sense, I would disagree with your comment about range for women as well)

My suggestion to anyone that has been hurt in a relationship is to open your heart quickly to another source and let your feelings flow out and in some cases it takes another woman or another man which ever is the victim here.    Trust me...it works. Once you can release all that you will be start the healing process allot sooner, but do not walk around keeping that tied up inside you.

Take care my good friends^^|`|41NyT8oPaa	Yes, but i will never commit suicide because of a guy, i try and forget about it and i move on with my life and now i'am happy again.|`|2TiwAfPvaa	masturbation and sports....|`|m86H7GRSaa	YES! i really wanted to die, but soon in around 1 month or so i got over him.and now when i look back, i feel so dumb how i wanted to end my life over a idiotic guy who did not deserve me. well i dun really know i really got over him, i cried every night.and could not stand to see his face. but i got myself involved i other activities and kept myself soo busy tt i had no time to think about him. i even tried dating other guys for a while, but now i'm alright.infact my ex came back apologising to me , to get back.but i refused...now he feels the pain i had...|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	I remember when the true love of my life broke up with me - for my best friend, yikes, i was heartbroken, I could not eat for 2 weeks, I felt sick, it was an awful time....but I did get over it!    In fact he later married my son's friend's mum and lives near me, and I'm not in the slightest bit bothered now.    Someone once told me about a book 'When [s]he moves out, I move on', I didnt ever get it but I think there is wisdom in the title.    Forgiveness plays an important role, dont hold onto bitterness as it will eventually destroy you and spoil you as a person.|`|eTO0ZIGvaa	I once liked this guy. He was 25 & I was 15. He was starting his career as a lawyer. Everytime we go out or to his family's home, I feel like I just dun fit in & I was so afraid if he was beginning to feel the same (though he was always so sweet). Then one day, I just felt I don't want to get hurt later on by this guy 'cos I didn't think I was able to handle it, so I broke it off. In the beginning, it was so bad. I could literally feel the pain at my chest & my throat. As years go by, I felt better. But I still could not stop thinking of him. He's doing so well now. I guess, the only thing that helped me get thru it is time. It does not heal, but it definitely makes it better.|`|AFwnNrkUaa	Very courageous thing you have done by forgetting the one who do not care for you.  Continue dear, and it is a good lesson to each and every person.|`|eG53oROJaa	i had a cleansing fire, i burned everything he had given me and everything i had that had been his.    then i did tequila shots followed by beer for several weekends in a row.    oh and i went to my cousin's house and trashed it (she had cheated with him.  stupid *****.|`|57X92zknaa	I have been heart-broken, and I'm right now too. But I don't want to die, I want to disappear.    Time is the best cure.|`|jrqXRqqCaa	my husband gave me the dosage of my own medicine;i cheated him,and he cheated back to marry the wife of my boyfriend,and it causes me great pain,my heart not only broken,i don't know how to fix it,and wanted to end my life as well,but,looking back,i learned my lesson the hardest way,that DO NOT DO UNTO OTHERS WHAT U DON'T WANT TO DO UNTO U...,but the only way to get through it is to FORGIVE and FORGET,just CHARGE IT TO EXPIRIENCE!|`|BC5AzEbAaa	yeah coz we were just not meant fo each other..we'll i just moved on with my life doing my daily activities..going out with friends and keeping myself busy with positive thoughts and engaged on hobbies..|`|c5Ypj1ZZaa	yes.  kept myself busy. focus more on things you love to do,.... any hobby. find a friend talk to them more...  coz each time im idle things jsut go bad... i remmber things... that's why i think the best is keeping myself busy|`|XAfzIBjdaa	yes  i believe so . my wife of 6 years left me because we did not see eye to eye on parenting. she had 3 kids who were my step kids who i do love very much. but she would not discipline them  when needed.she would take it personally  when i would yell at one of them.no matter what happened she would always take her kids side and make me look like the bad guy.about 4 months ago she ended up moving out. it took me a while to get over it but i finally did and now that she is gone a whole new world has opened up to me  *** MILDRED IS MY LEADER***
cidwIuJRaa	I think this question is alot more about yourself than about him.You need to question yourself here.You've been in a relationship over 10 years with a guy,so surely you must love the one you are with.    But,then,you know a guy for 7 months and just about have sex with him.Now,look at it from his viewpoint.Here's a girl coming on to him and being intimate with him while she still has someone else.That would scare anyone.    I've been *the other woman* before,so I know how bad that feels.It would kill a guy inside as well.He's avoiding you b/c you are sending him mixed signals.One day,you're wanting to be friends,and the next,you're wanting to f*ck,and that would confuse anyone,male or female.    I say you need to figure out whether you want to stay with your current boyfriend of all these years OR decide to make the friend your boyfriend.    And,you need to talk this over with said friend SOON,or you may end up losing his friendship.|`|Scupj6XVaa	if he was younger i would just say that he was horny.  but he should be mature by now.  maybe it scared him.. he might really care for you and since you are already in a committed relationship he might figure he has no chance.|`|8rF3wAHtaa	He is probably feeling confused himself, especially if you are in a relationship. He doesn't want to be "the other guy".|`|4uT1awZAaa	because he evidentlyyy loves you up & doesnt want get too excited as your already in a realtionshipp.|`|11c314e85f585a3fdde8a0d1a51af5f9aa	I would say this man friend loves you and want more of you. Much more than you are willing to give him. So now he feels hurt and his way to deal with it is not to contact you.  What should do? If it were me ,I would say we can only have a friendship and thats it.  Unless you want more than a friendship.Ask yourself what you really want?|`|MpaDeBynaa	he confused about him self.. and he don't know what is happen on between u and him.. imagine he just a 23 years boy, play for satisfaction and nothing else...|`|okedJicKaa	this is a very familiar situation for me. i can tell u the most likely reason is that he is in love with you and he wants more then friendship. and when a guy becomes like that it's hard to face that girl to see her with another guy or knowing that you can't have her. we tend to just back into a corner and wait ti out. u have to figure out if you love him and if you want to be with him and tell him that.can reach him through his best friend since u r his best friend try his guy friends.or visit him at his home. that is the best thing.  good luck
KPXwwwMMaa	Well, the first lesson here is NEVER to send very personal photos of yourself over the internet. It doesn't matter how closely you know them, just don't do it.     Secondly, it might be a good idea to talk to your friend and make sure the email didn't end up in her spam folder. That could easily happen if you have a major domain name on your email address. (i.e. if it's a hotmail, gmail or AOL account, it might easily send it to the 'junkmail' or 'spam' folder)    You could also try sending them to me. I'll tell you if they emailed okay.|`|OcwqsXYTaa	dont worry check the mail address..check it now and send it again..best of luck..it happens when we r in tension..
gRsuXxkbaa	I have a number that can help you 1 800 ABC DEFG  -  hooked on phonics ...there's yoursolution|`|b82ybE3gaa	I have absolutely no idea what the heck your talking about.    Its amazing cause I get like every third word but I still don't get it lol.     something about boyfriend, that you wanted to dump but you thought you loved him and now you want to make him cute and so hot happy?? I'm so messed up but i got points what what!!!|`|r1hURLPAaa	i m also in lovewith x standard girl who is 15 year old..she is very sweet|`|c4opXFzuaa	If it we're me, I'd be overjoyed if you'd learn to spell correctly and properly punctuate your sentences.|`|2IMCtD47aa	hmmm.. maybe you can tease him and go for walks with him, go out to see a scary movie and cuddle with him, something like that :]  awh.. i want a boyfriend so bad ]; your so luckyy.|`|KKhc5UiYaa	Housekeeping you want fluff pillow???|`|LdLt0vpRaa	u thot of dropping him but then thot of how much u love him?(doesnt really make alot of sense..not supposed to think if u love a person,u feel it)..forever is a mighty long time(not impossible though).u have to know if he isnt happy now but when u say make him happy wen u r "alone"..u might get a few pointers online but i think ur imagination and creativity has to do some work.wat kind of person is he?what does he like?for somepple a home made meal then a movie,cuddling afterwards or maybe sex might do the trick for others a night out with friends...or just wild n crazy sex...u know him best,use it to ur advantage
vAyvv5ngaa	seems like he doesnt trust you..you've tried everything you can to prove to him that youre not cheating..if i were you ill just let go..how can you go on with someone who doesnt trust you?sooner or later he might beat you up or something coz of he's accusations..dont wait for that to happen..maybe if you leave him he'll realize what a fool he is..but when you do that, make you sure you explain to him properly why youre doing it..coz he might think youre leaving him for someone else..|`|626efa044358e718840b4df8894964f1aa	I would tell him if it doesn't stop your leaving him. He isn't just jealous he is overly jealous and insecure. He probably cheated on you since he is accusing you of doing so.|`|08y217Rdaa	Throw him out of the window. Really.|`|sVkSrUqNaa	there is no way he has it in his head leave him and find a new guy.|`|w9iFqTgTaa	Thats not jealousy as much as it is paranoia and that in itself is usually a sign that he himself has been cheating on you.|`|fc4qv3vPaa	Your bf has so many insecurities with himself, you should just leave the relationship. You should find an equal partner, not someone who wants to dominate your life.
DxYwNFdhaa	Go over and talk to him he may be trying ta get ur attention for u to start talking to him.
DAuVOJXaaa	Whenever I my boyfriend and I get too busy about lives. But I give regards to individuality and being busy is part of it.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Yuppers.    I have a break up box which I put my 'special memories' kinda stuff in (eg pictures, letters etc). Sometimes I look thru it when I'm a bit down, but by physically removing things and puttong them in a sacred box, my 'good old days' memories fade a lot easier|`|jNQbVDHSaa	nostalgia is good. no need to overcome it|`|2Lw6Dozuaa	I'm sure almost everyone knows the feeling. But what I do is I tell myself "I will move on" The past is the past, you don't long for what is gone, you live right this minute. Will hoping for something that happened yesterday do any good? Hold on or let go. Longing for something that you know won't happen again won't do any good now, will it? Live your life right now and don't waste your time! Your happy and sad memories are what make you, it is who you are. Don't forget the past but don't long for it either! When something great happens, live every second of it and squeeze it like you'd cling to your life!
4drQ38qZaa	Just say hi and start a topic like school.|`|ixvzhoGUaa	I think the best way to make a someone comfortable to talk to you is just to smile & say Hi, introduce yourself and try to start casual conversations ! this will send the message to her that she can talk to you anytime & that she doesn't need to be nervous or hesitant. maybe ask her if she likes this class, and offer to help her out with something. You just want to kind of show her you're a nice person and you'd like to talk to her more =) just be yourself and let things happen naturally. good luck ! i hope i helped*
cWy17SRnaa	Ask your friends to ask him if he likes you.  If he does like you, you should take a risk and ask him out.  First, make sure that he likes you.  Hope this helps.  Good luck.
domEftoIaa	well if they are a good friend then its important. but if not then GOODBYE!
7gHnVJpyaa	Cool, you mean we get to choose your boyfriend?    Go with option B    Any bloke with a name like Justine needs to harden up!|`|vkIkFgqiaa	The 2nd, You answered your own question.|`|nRjY9J5Yaa	NEITHER CUZ IF UR HERE ASKN US OBVIOUSLY U DNT CARE TOO MUCH FOR EITHER 1|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	It seems that the secound guy is your best bet, he seems to be more considerate and caring for your individual needs. I have a slight suspicion that the first one, Justine, might just be wanting you because he's noticed someone paying attention to you and he's jealous you've stopped just liking him. Because of this he will more than likely be controling and possesive, and will probably want sex.  Hope I helped  Raych|`|sVkSrUqNaa	guy number 2 he sound  better than guy number 1 guy number 2 sounds like a guy who will be there for you    good luck|`|jg1pbV5Xaa	Smile! Smile at both of them while you keep your eyes open, do not get blinded by love or lust. Justine might love you but do you love him, trust him? No to either of those questions and you should drop him even if you said yes to one of the questions. You can love someone and be very hurt by them because they are not right for you even when they love you. Wrong is wrong and what is best for you must be a priority in your life. You are the only person in your life that will ALWAYS be there, everyone else is there only for a while, years and years perhaps, but only you are always in your life, even your babies grow up and move away. You have to take care of yourself, pick people who care about you, who care for you, who are looking out for your best interests not just what they can get from you. The second fellow sounds like a better choice, at the moment. He may not be the right one either but until you know him better you can not make that choice. He sounds like he cares for you, ask if you care for him.|`|Mq27uY0Maa	the second one cause he is always there for you the first one just wasted your time he just wants what he cant have....hope that helps|`|rM9xrqo1aa	well i think you schould go with the one that is always there for you i had something like this happen  to me before and turned out the guy that was saying he could be the man of my dreams turned out to be my bestfriends boyfriend that i dod not know about and shewanted to know if i would actually do that to her go with the one you think is right for you maby by personality or something hoped this helped you out bye|`|LdLt0vpRaa	go with justine..the 1st guy "could be" the man of ur DREAMS..if he feelsl like it or is up for it and a jerk the remaining time.u're right,it really sounds like he's up to something.do u want one to be always breaking ur heart or one thats there when u need him? cos thats wat it boils down to..doesnt really seem like a tough decision|`|fDCY1iX7aa	sit under a willow tree in a lilac dress at 3 minutes past midnight on the night of a new moon. peel an orange slowly and add a dab of lavender to the juice. the name of your true love will appear as oils on the surface.  hope this helps!|`|bS8Lzb9caa	tell the first guy that you believe him, that he doesnt like you.  tell him to stay out of your dreams, thats your job.    if the second guy is always there for you, and the 1st one isnt,  then dump  1 for  2 (after all,  ! doesnt like you anyway!)    if the 1st guy says he lied when he said he didnt like you, then  tell him "oh!..you're a liar!!..i dont like liars!!"    dont waste your time with liars, they will just make your life  miserable.  its possible that you wasted 2 years of your life.
KPXwwwMMaa	I would say you are a little too young to be worrying about dating yet. I know you're developing an interest in girls now, but you should really wait until you're 16-18 before even thinking about a girlfriend.     Secondly, think of online or xbox relationships as a regular relationship. Would you make guy friends online to hang out in real life? If you played Halo or Call of Duty with the same guy all the time, would you invite him over to your house eventually without knowing him at all? Well, then it's no different than a girl.     You don't know this girl or where she comes from. You don't know what she looks like or what her issues are. You only know she makes a lot of headshots in first person shooters and has a wicked guitar hero score.|`|EvDmgWjvaa	Just tell her you wish to be friends, you play xbox to relax and have fun not to complicate yours or others life.  When its us we always say we know, but this time its a little bit different.Just tell her you like her right now you busy at school, sports something and don't have time for anything but friends which she is.
EMcwjhZ4aa	Um... because he likes you maybe. You keep saying he's cute. You have to be looking at him to see he's looking at you. He might be asking himself the same question about you..|`|AA11289793	Whyyy oh Whyyy don't you try talking to him seen as he obviously infatuated with you but he is too shy...|`|shvhgzXeaa	Why do you think he obviously likes you.|`|189a19b4d9cbfea9513fabb7d3f3984aaa	Have you seen the movie : Twilight? maybe the same thing happened to him :)|`|eVK2zZsOaa	He could be in deep thought and you just happen to be in his stare direction, he could be looking at somebody near you, or he might be interested in you. It is really hard to tell...you have to base what his stares mean on the way he stares. You could also just walk up to him and strike up a conversation but be careful the stares might not mean anything and you don't want to make a fool of yourself. Proceed with caution but do proceed. After the class if over, ask a question about something the teacher discussed to see what the convo turns into, who knows where it might go from there.|`|yGPRntXFaa	He likes you and loves the way you  look or your hair looks and is too shy to tell you... he gets butterflies in his stomach when you look at him back..    My advice, if you think he's cute and you would like to be with him... ask him to meet you somewhere and give him a note like.... WRITE ME A LOVE LETTER... and if she does, then he is worthy of you and back... or you write him a love letter......... make sure, he is mature and kind and not a clown that would make fun of your letter or simple message...      You sound young and love is about trial and error until you hopefully find someone great that you can keep for a long time...... so if he's shy... make him not shy... make the move yourself........... and don't share to much about him with other girls in class, etc You don't want them trying to take him from you... it happens....... best of luck...    . best of luck to you and I hope this helps........ kindly let me know... Have a great day... BTW, I'm Alex from New York and I'm 31....... just a bit about me... The End....|`|dbe0ao9Vaa	He has a crush on you! Why don't you ask him??|`|5sCpMpbWaa	Well i think that boy likes you. If you like him you should get his number and call him.Goodluck..|`|1ZuKz1OFaa	probably rating you. seeing if you could be his potential girl.  just stare back and annoy him back, but he'll probably like it if he does like you|`|AA10669616	Maybe the feelings you're having are mutual.  Maybe he thinks your cute and he cant help but to stare......lol annoying you say??  Maybe deep down you like him looking at you. makes ya feel like your wanted..hehe  Nah, I wouldn't worry bout it.  Ask him if he sees something he likes next time and arch your eye brows when ya ask him..........  You just seem to mention at the beginning and the end of your explanation that he is cute so maybe you like him as well.....|`|fDCY1iX7aa	tell him "take a picture, it will last longer"
pOCabUMvaa	Who cares what other people think about how much attention a wife gives her husband??    If they are both fine with it, then nothing else matters.    If you spend your whole life believing in what other people say, then you will not be able to think on your own and to function on your own.    Just do your best at being the best wife possible.|`|EENUWAP7aa	A woman builds her Man to what she wants.|`|nBQeSu2faa	The first thing you need to do is..learn what love really means. If you think love is all about hugs,kisses, sex, cooking him nice meals, giving him lots of attention...then you have a lot to learn...of course these things are important and they should come naturally, you should not have to plan them...but they are not love...they are the signs of love. Love goes much deeper. It doesn't matter how much confidence the man has..if he love you , he will be faithful to you.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	I say YOU know NOTHING about love if your asking this kind of question???????? You need to learn a lot about relationships and love.|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	There is a fine line!  I know someone who met a guy with no self esteem he felt unworthy of life and love and she spent so much time building up his confidence etc and helping and supporting him that his head got big, he fell in love with himself and met someone else!    Its always good to encourage and support and love but this should be MUTUAL.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	yes, he will shower you with more love|`|uRc8z7gjaa	gift idea      http://www.amazon.com/gp/gift-central?ta...

b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	I had two guest lists: one of people that I definitely wanted to invite, and one made up of people we were not close to anymore.  Count how many people you have on your 'definitely inviting' list and then figure out how many more people can come.  I would keep it simple and only invite the people you really want to spend time with.  So if that means basketball buddies and no friend from high school (or the other way around) so be it.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well there's a good reason not to invite the guy who wants to be invited- it's totally tacky to ask to be invited to a wedding.  he should only invite the guys from that group that he's very close to, and not worry about anyone else's hurt feelings.  guys don't really care about their friend's weddings and crap anyway.  it's all about the bride.  as for your friend, if you got the feeling you were putting more effort into staying in touch than she was, forget her.  I've let tons of people go who didn't have time for me for whatever reason in the past few years, and I wouldn't bother to invite them to my wedding.|`|DCXss6Odaa	I wouldn't invite your friend(s) from high school if you never see them.  Your fiance is different, every few months they see each other to play basketball.  You need to decide what your maximum about of guests is.  Then write down the definate's.  then write a list of the extra's and then with however many spaces you have left, invite the one's you want the most    Good luck|`|AA11603468	You only invite the people you have ongoing active relationships with. Someone you haven't spoken to in 2 years because your friendship fizzled isn't invited, nor is someone your husband only speaks to once every several months, but doesn't really like.     I had someone outright tell me she would pay to be invited to my wedding (totally nuts, IMO) , but she wasn't invited. In the end, the wedding is about the 2 of you becoming husband and wife, and it will be a much more special day if you invite the people who mean something to you.|`|y6gVmhHxaa	I think a general rule should be if it's someone who you haven't spoke to in the last year you shouldn't feel any sort of obligation to invite them.  If I were your Fiance I would invite the guys he sees pretty regularly and not the rest.  If anyone brings it up that they weren't invited in the future just explain you were on a really tight budget and after the family list there wasn't much room.  They will understand.|`|JCAgvgTxaa	Use the "one year" rule.     If you or your groom have not seen or socialized with a potential guest within the last year, then it is not necessary to invite that person.    Relatives may be exceptions to that one-year rule.  For example, you have not seen Great Aunt Sally (who lives in another state) for 18 months.  You know she would be heartbroken if she did not receive a wedding invitation.  In that case, you would send the invitation.    Good luck with your guest list and your planning.
dCMi5rjdaa	how about something like    'hey, how's it going? had a pretty busy week. how bout you?  haven't heard from you in a while, starting to get concerned. everything all right?'    Good Luck|`|a6yPxjYRaa	Be like hey stranger its been awhile. haha    Sorry im really sarcastic and i would honestly say that.|`|og3Tmn0saa	That might be one of those things where you just have to ask her to her face.

Right what you have got to do is go up to her and give her a kiss make sure you can see you phone or reach it. then pick it up and look through your texts and then while you have still got her in your arms say 'babe ive not had a call from you in a while' this is a great way to tell her then she will give you a response and probably tell you the reason why with out you having to ask her any more questions. hope this helps xx
N8DgVu9Aaa	I think that he took it the wrong way & he found it funny. He was inconsiderate to think you would find it just as funny. When it sounds like you felt insulted - although i am not saying that you did feel like that!- cuz i am nobody to say that. -         Just ignore his joke as i'm sure he didn't want to upset you.  Just forget it & move on. Act like nothing happened... BUT he was in the wrong! x|`|WNhQzmo3aa	Sounds like he's hinting something....  He also sounds like the freak in your relationship
eVK2zZsOaa	It sounds like you need a good divorce lawyer. That is not a healthy environment for your children to be in and you need to leave at least for their sake.|`|AA11796667	I have no choice but to tell you that your going trough this simply because you want too, I mean you are earning good money you can simply move out and start your life over, many women in your case stay in a relationship like that because they do not have the means to get out but you do so what does that tell you? OK you also say that he is a good dad but guess what he can continue to be a good dad even if you leave him so what are you waiting for? your situation sounds unbearable, and your man sounds crazy manipulating and selfish. What are you waiting for? get your children out of there before your son learn how to treat women like crap. Do it for your children, do not use them as an excuse to stay use them as an excuse to leave is the right thing. Start over is my advice. Good luck. You can do bad all by your self and believe if you leave  you won't do bad but good for your life and your children lives.|`|seHs6Ec1aa	Well u love him ..    and u will neva eva forgot him ..

This is an unhealthy relationship.  Leaving him does not necessarily mean that he can't be in your children's lives.  Don't let that stop you from regaining control of your life.    Perhaps you guys need to separate for a while first, if you're really hesitant about taking that step to get a divorce.  He is a recovering alcoholic so he is not always stable, but he may be trying to regain stability in his life.      You need to let him know how you feel|`|8NbpkRpEaa	I know you stay for the kids sake, but you can't forget about yourself. When the kids are grown- what will be left of your spirit? Will it be worn down to a tatter? If I was you I'd measure it out. Are you 100, 75, 50, or 25% unhappy? When your reaching 100 and are basically waking up with sadness all the time- it's time to make the break. It's making you sick and you can't raise your children properly like that. The children will adjust and are probaly more resilient than you will be in the end. No man is worth you being put through all that hell! You think you are staying so the kids be with their dad on a daily basis? Whatever. From my experience, guess what? It turns out to be a crock of crap. Kids need to be raised in happy loving enviroment- not one of..... I would start making plans to relocate and only on your terms.
IKXZZDH9aa	If he was like this when you married him, then you have no grounds for complaint now.     Either way, having friends of the opposite sex is not wrong. You forcing your insecurities on him is. You have deeper issues, personal issues, that YOU need to deal with figure out why you are so intimidated by other women.    A lot of my good friends are women, and my wife knows that. In fact, I'll tell her that I'm going to lunch with on of them cause I'm off, and her response usually is to bring her something from the restaurant. She's not insecure, although she used to be.    She realized that HER issues were going to be the reason for the severance of our relationship, and that it wasn't the fact I had female friends. She got over herself, as you should.|`|6wzQhsIkaa	Is there any indication that he is cheating? Some people naturally get along with the opposite sex, me for instance.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Having female friends is fine - but telling lies isn't. The fact that he lies makes me very suspicious of him.. if they were just friends, why would he need to lie?     You and your husband should seek counseling if you can. You have young kids and should at least try to figure out what's going on before leaving - he may be innocent.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Well it DOES bother you him having female friends, or you wouldn't be on here asking this question. BUT if he had a good relationship with you, then I can't see why he would feel the need for female friendship if he was close to you?? I'm taking it as he doesn't treat you the same way??? i wouldn't like it. I think he may be getting off on these female friends. Why would he have to lie about it if it was so innocent?? thats what you need to be asking yourself.|`|8Xu0A70Saa	It is so unbearable and unexcusable, give him an ultimatum to stop the flirting communications with his so called female co-workers immediately, If your husband does not agree with you, then seek a divorce immedaitely.|`|OZFhyEw4aa	Dump him he has huge ego issues. I wouldnt sleep with him as the other poster said, I assume you arent using protection. If you sleep with him, cover yourself with rubber first. No I do not agree with your signicant other having women as friends that he confides in. He should be confiding in you and being a father. We leave these childish things behind when we marry and we show our loved ones one thing he is NOT showing you. RESPECT|`|PyEPbKysaa	Give him the best sex of his life.  And he will never utter another womans name.  Easy 2 points.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	Why don't you give him a chance to get it better before you break up the lives of your 2 daughters?|`|2IMCtD47aa	listen to your instincts, he is obviously doing something and doesn't want you to know. Who talks to their wife about their female friends sleeping with men? I think it's time for you to move on, he is no good. But, it is not my decision, you choose what is right for you, and your family. Good luck.|`|jNQbVDHSaa	if you knew that would you have married him? the guy has issues but which i think you can live with. some men have a weakness for talking to women all the time. the other problem is lying.|`|XoOanmdraa	knock his brains out with some of your magic|`|yd2SP7d6aa	Unless your husband is a metrosexual (or gay) the chances of him really giving a crap about female friends (besides wanting to screw them) is slim to none.  Even if he isn't actively looking to screw them, your husband has some issues because he likes the feeling of flirting (makes him feel wanted by other women) / hearing details of these womens sexual life.    Thats what it comes down to for most men that have female friends.  It's one thing to have a female co-worker and to go out for lunch (while at work) to shoot the breeze (and keeping it professional and asking innocent questions about the kids etc.). However, any man that is running around on his off days to hang out with a female friend is either actively crussing for some butt or he likes the feeling of being "wanted / close" to another woman so he can tell himself that other men find him desirable.  Otherwise why bother with women because outside of "male" likes / dislikes (which is why you have male friends), your wife should be more than enough to talk about all other issues (and if she isn't you got problems)|`|wqdA2LWRaa	Listen dear  To leave your husband is something so hard to do , you got 2 child , All you have to do to let him feel more attracted to you   second prove to him that you know everything he do , and try to let him start a new relation with you and forget the past|`|oeEsnwSMaa	I would not like it! but it looks like he know you don't like it, and he is going to keep it up!!! you need to take care of you!! and the children  only you know what you want  good luck|`|md81qUq5aa	Talk with him about how it makes you feel that he has so many female friends, especially the fact that they tend to sleep with married men/men that are already in relationships with other women.  He needs to tone it down.  Let him know that it's negatively affecting your marriage and your trust in him and that in order to keep your union going strong, it's necessary for him to try to understand where you are coming from as well as be willing to compromise and tone it down.  If that doesn't work, perhaps you need an arbitrator and should pursue marriage counseling.  In the end though, if all your efforts are unsuccessful you should probably separate from him (rather that divorce him right away) so that he knows that you mean business.  Divorce only if necessary after all that.  But that should be the very last option.|`|XAfzIBjdaa	EXPRESS how it makes you feel and you might be surprised of the outcome  *** MILDRED IS MY LEADER***
7q9MN1Wkaa	I LOVE Asian guys!! My BF is Chinese, I'm white. I've dated slightly more Asians than whites. But I think I'm still in the minority in the US. It's changing, tho. I see more & more Asian guy/ White girl couples.    I think most Asian guys are just too intimidated by white women.  They are just chicks!  Ask the out.  Trust me, they would be flattered.  Even if an ugly guy (or someone I wasn't attracted to at all) asked me out, I would be flattered.  Just go for it.    I found that Asian guys are less "proactive" when it comes to dating.  Sometimes I have to do the work!  But it paid off.  My BF is HOT!|`|nod3Ne9yaa	Everybody loves an Asian boy!    Then again, I'm an anime fan..........;)    If whether or not you're asian matters to this girl then you shouldn't bother with her at all. It's about chemistry not ancestry :)    Just go for it like you would any other girl, and see what happens ^_^    Good luck!|`|RvXwjC7Yaa	if its chinese asian, then consider yourself fairly lucky, if you look cute and are good looking then bingo. if you mean brown asian, then your probably not cute, but you have to be very good looking to get white girls that are beautiful.|`|yGPRntXFaa	Asian guys or any race guys are attractive to all kinds of girls... one problem with Asians is that usually you guys only date Asians and everyone kinda knows this and if they like you they may think that you wont like them back or your parents and family wont approve of them... so just go out with her to lunch or something easy and show her that you are open and cool about dating anyone, etc... see how it goes.........    I am latin and dated asian girls before and had exactly those problems I mentioned.. Ive given up on them... sucks but asian girls are so hot and cool and gentle and kind and sexy, etc.. but those mindsets of only dating in their own race sucks for me...but if it works for them then good luck.............. look at that harold and kumar film and see the hot babe he got at the end..... that could be you......     . best of luck to you and I hope this helps........ kindly let me know... Have a great day... BTW, I'm Alex from New York and I'm 31....... just a bit about me... The End....|`|shvhgzXeaa	Try and get to know her more so that you read the signals more clearly of her feelings for you.

I'm usually more nervous about whether the asian guys will like me-as if they're from stricter families their mothers usually (in my experience anyway) prefer them dating girls from the same country. Like some Europeans I guess :)|`|suKoM2owaa	are you like a racist or something? wtf...what do YOU think?
UgZq1pXjaa	Well if its because you are going out and getting wasted and you can't control yourself once you get home and your messing the bedding, then I say lay down and get diapered like a man and wear diapers to bed.  I can understand if it was once or twice but since you keep wetting the bed, you need a diaper, plain and simple.  I was a bed wetter so I know how nasty wetting the bed is which is why they make disposable diapers.  Your GF doesn't want to clean the bedding and sheets everynight so I can understand why she got you diapers.   I wet past the age of 15 and was in diapers every night.    Either know your limit when you go out and party, or go get wasted and know you gonna get diapered when you get home.|`|7UVFSjFBaa	umm..you wet the bed...okay....  well i think you should try to talk to your GF..and stuff...  and if she really want to leave you i think thats not realy love..|`|JexFy4Cnaa	Omg, that is really cruel of her. She will make a great mother some day, but really she shouldn't be treating you like that. If you like the idea wear them (nothing wrong with the kinky stuff) but i would be upset and a bit humiliated. I had a boyfriend once who was ocasionally a bed wetter. I showed him all empathy, never made him feel a tiny bit bad. If it ever got me i jumped in the shower, he changed the bed the hopped in the shower with me and i would give him a big cuddle.    Ask her to wear a raincoat to bed instead of you wearing a nappy.    Lets hope her tampon leaks one time in bed, have a giant sanitary pad ready to make her wear, big deal the whole thing see how she likes that.|`|og3Tmn0saa	I think that's her way of telling you that YOU'RE PISSING HER OFF BY DOING STUFF THAT MAKES YOU WET THE BED.  I think you need to get a clue and learn to communicate better.|`|zka26204aa	You need to consult with a doctor about your problem, unless you are just drinking too much!!!  A 25 year old man should not have a problem with wetting a bed. It is not normal!    My son was a bed wetter too, but the doctor told me that he would grow out of it and he did.  It was caused from his internal organs not developing as fast as they should have.  Now he are perfectly fine, and you should be also.|`|sVkSrUqNaa	learn to use the big boys potty

I know it can be annoying when people want to copy every thing that you do. I would just tell her that it bothers you and if she doesn't mind cutting it out. Maybe give her some tips to have a style all her own. That may help.   Best wishes|`|TJntzGB2aa	If anything it shouldn't make you mad, what might bother her though is that you are taking it as a compliment...|`|jDOeA6wtaa	talk to her. and tell her what you feel.|`|jI4O0eFmaa	Just tell her to stop following you and say that is irritating.|`|700GE22raa	It's nice to have some one around you. You are like a role model to her. You don't worry, she will move away from you soon, when she realizes that it is a bad thing to move behind any one, like iritating.    You don't get irritated to her. I think, she adores you and like to act and behave like you.

umhMpKz7aa	i totally understand and have been in the same situation. what i did was to set my boundaries. I had to say this is the deal...FOR ME to have control i need you to stay away from this line here and this line down here. And if he is the type of person you want in your life for a serious relationship he will understand that what you want is most important and should be respected. no matter what. if he chooses to continue to try to fight your boundaries you may be with a guy who has no respect for you...be very concerned about this relationship. i was with this person for 6 years and we were able to work it out and have fun and be intimate and enjoy each other with out sex...it can be done. the self control is good for him and you will find that if he is a keeper this arrangement will improve other parts of your relationship dramatically. so stay strong...saving sex till marriage is worth every single effort as a teen...best thing i ever did. find out your boundaries. be strong verbalizing them and adhering to them and he will get the picture. good luck and i commend you!|`|qg6Dntq5aa	For me it is not an issue that should affect your relationship if you both love and respect frankly, simply, if he not told you the whole truth, which deserves to hear and evaluate his sincerity. Regardless what the situation, if he has met you and accepted your terms for a serious relationship with you, this should not be a drawback. Deserves that  you understand and forgive him.|`|M5kUNkbMaa	Well, does it bother you enough to leave him?  Like you said, it's not something he can change.  So you can either accept him for what he is--not a virgin, or if it makes you too uncomfortable, then maybe you shouldn't be with him.  There is nothing wrong with either decision--you need to be comfortable with the person you are dating.  If you feel he is trying to pressure you to have sex, then he is not right for you.  It is your decision to wait or not wait for sex, and if he is going to try to sway your opinion, it's not worth the hassle.  Good luck girlie!|`|PyqmgSByaa	He probably just wants sex...u need 2 find some1 that is a virgin 2 & plans 2 stay that way until ur married. Ur still young & have a lot 2 live don't f*** up.

AA11102663	Start off by saying you need some help and ask him if would he be willing to help you.  Then say that you are often bashful and realize that this behavior could have many costs if it continues throughout your life, such as career, relationships, and unrealized dreams.  <br>  <br>  Today you are taking a step to change that - you are talking to him and he is already helping you because he is listening to you.  <br>  <br>  Then say "Now i would like to ask you your name and I will tell you mine.  Then please say congratulations, you completed this important step!"<br>  <br>  Then thank him for helping you and walk away.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, he will be intrigued and you will have this 'quest' to help you with future conversations.<br>  Good luck!|`|4cpeg0dZaa	just tell him hi,and ask his name if you don't know it, try to make a connection.

Don't leave anyone out and don't be confused or upset.<br>  In the end, if they will not understand, even after you explain, well, then maybe you shouldn't be such close friends.

I wonder what she's like? I'd love to get to know her, I think I could fall in love with her. I wish I could meet her..."<br>  <br>  They are thinking "Boobs."<br>  <br>  Porn isn't about finding relationships with other women. It's not about leaving you for one of those blonde, fake-breasted bimbos. It's about the visual stimulation. Just watch some sometime - it's mostly close-up shots of penetration. Porn isn't made to celebrate the beauty and wonderful qualities of the women in it. It's made to visually stimulate the man. It can actually be really good for his libido. Besides, it's better than going to strip clubs. <br>  <br>  Porn isn't necessarily bad for a relationship. He should respect your wishes, of course - if you don't like it then he should lay off the porn, or at least keep it somewhere that you don't have to see it all the time. It only really becomes a problem if he's got an unhealty addiction to it, or won't respect your wishes. You may find it easier to compromise with him than get him to give it up entirely.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	Yes, it is bad for a relationship.<br>  Hun, if he is satisfied by those ******* sluts, than you should dump him asap.|`|x3EPqezJaa	All men like porn.

Because they are visually stimulated.  It doesn't hurt the relationship if you don't let it, and no it does not mean he's not satisfied with you.  Watch it with him.|`|AA11706291	Even a guy couldn't give a specific reason as to why he watches porn.<br>  <br>  It only makes a difference to the relationship if it bothers the partner to much.|`|M627my7Baa	It's bad for the relationship if his partner doesn't like it. It could be ANYTHING--"Honey, I really hate hate hate it when you leave the bathroom door open. Maybe it's a personal issue I have, but I can't stand it, and I need you to keep it closed for me." -- But if the man knows you hate it and still does it anyway, then he doesn't care about your feelings. <br>  <br>  Yes, men are visual creatures. Yes, much of society thinks porn is okay since they Look But Don't Touch. But if a married man is looking at another woman and simulating a sex act using his hand and his wife is not comfortable with that. . .then how on earth is he doing anything but harming his relationship?<br>  <br>  Don't buy into that "Boys will be boys!" B.S. How would he like it if you announced, "I cannot stop looking at this picture of a man who looks nothing like you and has way better abs and doesn't have a hairy back like you. .and I just can't help but touch myself! Man, I can just imagine being in his muscular arms. . " Suddenly, it's not so acceptable! <br>  <br>  Listen to your heart on this one.

3GHXk05saa	Cultural differences are magnified in high school because everyone is so insecure. Since most teens restrict kissing to the one they're dating, I'd back off just for the sake of keeping the peace. I'm not saying it's right to expect you to change but the fact of the matter is with the way the rest of the kids are viewing your actions you are going to get a bad reputation and if someone really takes offense you might get your clock cleaned as well.<br>  Most schools have rules against PDA anyway.<br>  After you get out of high school the social kiss becomes more acceptable, but you should still always greet the girlfriend the same way, even if you know the guy better to avoid hard feelings.|`|GExKoh1Gaa	dont kiss their boyfriends on their cheeks.kiss their lips|`|jvR2HC6Laa	unless your close friends with them dont|`|AA11190264	babygirl, you can't teach the girls the differences in cultures. they're just not mature enough to realize. in their eyes, it's just not right. and you should repect their way of thinking. if you're in europe, then absolutely, kissing on the cheek is the way to go. but you are here with our boring american custom.

It's not normal to ignore you're own child for great lengths of time to chat on the internet.<br>  <br>  Tell her she has to decide who is more important you or the men on the computer.

No one ever feels the "in Love" all the time. It just doesn't happen. A relationship is hard work if you both want to work on it.<br>  <br>  Obviously there's a lack of communication that's been going on for a while.

Are you sure that you like her or is it just the idea of her that you like. If you had her, then weren't interested, then liked her, had her, and again weren't interested It sounds like you like what you can't have. And now that she's completely ignoring you, you think you're in love with her and that she's "the one". You need to take a minute and really think about this. Do you really like her, because if you do this again she might kill you (j/k). To get back in her good graces send her flowers, give her chocolates, and send her notes telling her that you were a fool to play with her heart like that and you'll do anything to make her forgive you.|`|3V6QxYA9aa	its gonna be ok <br>  just tell her that your sorry come out and tell her that you think shes the one and that your deeply in love with her and say that if you give me another chance i promise i will make it right and if she doesnt respond what you wanted her to say then say ok im sorry lets just be friends then i no its hard but if you go into this relationship with her again Dont SCREW it up.|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Keep trying and telling her that you made a mistake in blowing her off. Stress what an idiot you are for doing it lol. Be really sincere and open. She's probably trying to see if this is just a phase your going through and whether you're really serious about it. If you have to tell her she doesn't have to in a relationship with you right out the gate but ask her for the chance to take her out on some dates and show her you can be serious. i.e. punctual, romantic, attentive etc. Good luck|`|STvB9OGhaa	If it helps try texting her or calling her.If you already tried that then its okay.Another thing you can do is try to send her roses.Give her a card & tell her what you really feel about her,Don't do it into an essay.Keep trying that & if doesn't work then just give her some time and hopefully she'll come into conclusion & wanting you back.Girls sometimes need a little bit of time to straighting things out.|`|IGYa2yF6aa	Are you sure you didn't just decide you love her now because she blew you off? Guys love the hunt ya know. And girls don't like to be taken for granted or jerked around. But if you really and truly want her, you have to be patience and work at getting her. If you push, it won't work. Show her you're trustworthy by doing nice things for her without expecting anything in return.|`|6Votx6pfaa	Call her ONCE, leave a voicemail apologizing, say how much she means to you and how you feel about her. At the end, just say i miss you, i really want to talk to you, call when your ready so we can talk.

I will say it's going to be a challenge. Being a woman who has dealt with a guy such as yourself, words are not going to do the trick alone. Action, action, action. She is feeling betrayed and used. After more than one rejection that's when the guard goes up and all trust is out the door. First time shame on you, the second time shame on me. This girl probably doesn't hate you, but doesn't trust you anymore. You have her on your mind like this because of guilt. At least you are man enough to admit you screwed up. I can respect that about you.|`|RxRH3u9gaa	you should tell her how you feel, and you should tell her you are sorry and you are into her|`|2pNUIJ5Jaa	do something that will just amaze her and let her kno your the one for her it doesnt have to be amazing maybe like bring her roses while shes at work or sumting

If you have a really good idea or invention, get a patent and some sponsor to make u rich.

JtEBaOdjaa	OH! link to the dress?<br>  I love dresses with colour in them.  They are so different and gorgeous.  I think they had that look cause they weren't.you, assuming you'd wear white.  It's different.<br>  <br>  Have you ever seen the dresses women wear to weddings in India? Gorgeous, colourful Sari's.  It's all about the colour over there.<br>  <br>  Now do you want the actual reason behind white?<br>  Simply, Queen Victoria wore white, everyone loved it and imitated it. It caught on and became the norm.  It has NOTHING to do with purity, since blue is the colour of purity according to the church.  At some point churches decided "hey if everyone's wanting to wear white, let's guilt them into it".  But before Queen Victoria, people just wore their nicest clothing that they owned, whatever colour that may be. It usually wasn't white because white showed dirt easily and lower classes wanted to hide the dirt on their clothes as long as possible.<br>  <br>  EDIT: OMG I FRIGGEN LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that is so gorgeous!!!|`|TJKvoLeBaa	It is very common anymore for brides to wear alternate colors.  Look at Alfred Angelo, they have a whole dream in color line of dresses. <br>  <br>  Maggie Sottero has:  Gold, Oyster, Scarlet,Rose, Blush,  Silver, Pearl, Champagne  and so on. <br>  <br>  Many many designers are making different color  choices available as it is more and more common for color to be in a wedding.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	There is nothing wrong with wearing whatever colour you want.<br>  I am wearing white because I look hot in it and also because it is the only day of my life I can get away with wearing a big white dress without people looking at me funny.<br>  I think coloured dresses can be beautiful, but I am happy to wait to balls and parties to wear tham.|`|CYcqQb6Caa	i understand where your coming from. i think that most females want a white dress becuz when we all are growing up we think of our wedding day and walking down the isle in white. my dress was white and i loved it. i think that as long as you like the dress then you will be fine. but you may want to talk to your future husband and see what his opinions are. hope this helps|`|EKp4Cg0vaa	The color white has been a symbol of joyous celebration since early Roman times. At the beginning to the twentieth century, white stood for purity as well. Today, it holds it original meaning of happiness and joy.  <br>  <br>  Wear what ever makes you happy.|`|C7wN4NxEaa	you don't need to wear white.<br>  many brides don't wear white. it's YOUR wedding and you can wear whatever you please.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	It is just "in general" that most brides tend to wear a white or cream gown...this is why people are asking about your choice of dress.<br>  <br>  However, you are the bride, and like you said, many designers are making non-white wedding gowns these days.  You are entitled to wear whatever dress (or pants!) you like.<br>  <br>  Fair warning though, if you choose to be different:  A recent US Magazine article quoted Sarah Jessica Parker, who famously wed in a BLACK gown, saying that if she were to redo her wedding all over again, she would certainly NOT wear a black gown.<br>  <br>  Just because the dress and color appeals to you now and reflects your lifestyle, it doesn't mean you might not grow to regret this decision years down the line, when you are staring down at your wedding portrait wishing you chose something different.  You wouldn't want one of those, "what was I thinking?!?" moments.|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	White never meant virginity, that's some crazy talk. It became a fashion statement thanks to Queen Victoria. Before her, everyone wore their Sunday's best!<br>  <br>  Whenever I get married I'm not going to wear stark white. I personally love ivory, it just seems more beautiful and classic. I've always dreamed of wearing an ivory dress at my wedding, and so I shall (whenever we decide to get married that is!)<br>  <br>  I feel you should wear whatever color you desire and whatever color reflects you! Don't wear something you don't want to wear just because tradition says you should!|`|884v4VhGaa	The reason that you're expected to wear white is because everyone does it. People like being taken for upper class (why else would women grow their nails long or wear high heels?). Wearing a white dress was a great way to show that you have extra money. By the time that white dresses weren't impractical, everyone could afford them so everyone wore them. Hence it is what is done. It's the same reason that you're expected to have flowers, and a wedding party, and serve a fancy meal (instead of a normal one).|`|IHUtA8o9aa	PPl think the dress is supposed to be white because it symbolizes "purity".<br>  But its "your" wedding day and you can wear whatever color dress you want.<br>  Some ppl wear light blue, a tannish "off white" dresses. Sarah Jessica Parker wore a BLACK dress! haha<br>  So it's your wedding day and you dont have to be original like everybody else.<br>  Be unique :)|`|mvKDbb2uaa	Bombshell is right.<br>  <br>  Wearing white on your wedding day has NOTHING to do with purity contrary to popular belief.  The white wedding dress was popularized by Queen Victoria.  White represents power and money and that's what she wanted to convey.  Having a white dress made to be worn once was a luxury.  In most cultures actually white represents death and red is a more common color to wear to weddings.<br>  <br>  I say wear whatever you want and what represents you, so don't fall for the whole "white equals purity and virginity" because the white wedding dress did not at all have anything to do with any of that.|`|4POGapREaa	I'm so over all the rules of weddings.  My dress was ivory with black lace detail.  It suited me, I loved it, my husband loved it, and that was that.  I can't believe people are so bored that they have to OMG over a pink dress.  Whatever.  It's pink.  It's not like you're having a Star Trek wedding or chomping the heads off of bats.|`|F4k68ilkaa	Good point - I agree. You're preaching to the choir here. :-) <br>  <br>  You can tell people that their 'tradition' is actually relatively recent. Queen Victoria started the trend, and it had nothing to do with purity. It had to do with show of wealth, and white fabric being expensive. <br>  <br>  So, purity, schmurity. It's totally unrelated. Wear a color you look good in.|`|0Id85yiYaa	like you said, it's tradition. most likely people will be pleasantly surprised. people love things that are different and that makes for conversation. some people, like your parents, fiance and FMIL, can't hide their reactions very well. who cares?! you found the one; quit letting others get to you.<br>  <br>  congrast, by the way|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It's only worn out of tradition. Most people get upset when someone even thinks about breaking tradition and claim that your marriage will be doomed if you do. It's up to the bride herself what she wears, no one else.<br>  <br>  White symbolizes wealth and has nothing whatsoever to do with purity. Blue is the color that symbolizes purity and has since the beginning of time. White in several countries is actually funereal and is associated with death and mourning. I have heard from a few people that black in Hispanic cultures is traditional for a bride. Countless brides in other cultures wear red since it symbolizes love, passion and festivity.|`|8IA3d3NNaa	PSSH it's your wedding (and i think your dress is so pretty (besides, some of it is white). My (future) MIL wore a short (knee length) pink dress at her wedding, (all pink) and it was her first wedding, and she wasn't a virgin, but nobody would have guessed (i mean they couldn't prove it lol). <br>  <br>  Wear whatever you want to (within the law).

Give it time and you'll find someone whose truly worth it in the end. What was horrible was that I did find the one and we ended up breaking up over distance and I hated it because I still loved him and his feelings changed because we didn't get to see each other that often. I hate being single now and had tried to find someone new but the reality is that I should stop trying so hard and let love find me. I'm probably not even ready to date now anyway because love hasn't found me yet.|`|EPfNPWmmaa	Like your insides are ripping apart and you suddenly feel sick.

XNIkS3KNaa	Wow that's some major stuff that went on there!!  This is kind of hard to give advise because everyone's family is different.  It seems to me you mom needs to try and stick up for herself a little bit in stead of others doing it for her, but I think it's very good of you to stick up for your mom like that since your dad won't.  He should also be sticking up for your mom especially since it's his side of the family that's upsetting her!  Although I never like violence, you heart was in the right place.  <br>  <br>  Even though you say that you're the man of the house and that you should never show emotion, sometimes it's very bad to bottle things up.  There's nothing wrong with showing some emotion, in fact it's better if you do sometimes for you and everyone else.  Bottling things up can only end in disaster because it builds and builds until there's nowhere to go but out, usually on the person closest to you and sometimes that person may be yourself.  That's just my experience on that part.  <br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't help really, just thought I'd give my opinion in there at least. :)

But please, don't cheat on ur man. U wouldn't like it if the shoe was on the other foot would u? If u know he's a good man, but he's got problems, u don't cheat on him because ur unhappy. i know talking to him might not be feasable to u right now, and given ur current state of mind, I can see y ur only motive for staying in this marriage would be because of school, but if ur heart doesn't love ur man any more and wants to explore, then divorce first. Dont cheat. If he's a good man, dont hurt him. Don't punish someone for something they don't know how to do. He does, but he prefers cigs n bottles to u now. But cheating isn't the answer. It's only a temporary fix. U'll even resent ur hubby after a while.<br>  <br>  Try to hang in there and finish school, then if ur still miserable in ur marriage, call it quits.

Abuse does not have to be in the form of someone using you as a punching bag and leaving bruises behind as a memento of what transpired. Emotional abuse is worse and, in my opinion, harder to undo the damage when you finally get the courage to leave the relationship - which I sincerely hope you do as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  I would not agree to have a baby with him b/c you would then be "tied" to him for the rest of your natural lives, and there is no guarantee that he will not transfer his abusive behavior to the child. IF you cannot afford to move on your own, check with your local domestic abuse hotline, explain to them what is going on, and that you want to leave. They can help you find a way to get out of there safely, and you can call them anonymously.<br>  <br>  Do not cheat on your husband b/c if he finds out the emotional abuse can easily turn into a physical confrontation when he has a little too much to drink. If you and this other man are meant to be, you will find a way to be together safely w/o bringing the wrath of your husband down on you ... <br>  <br>  If you can't afford to move on your own, try finding a roommate to help split the bills. Even attending school, you should be able to find someone who can make things a little easier on you. You will probably have to find a part-time job somewhere, but you can do this ... You need to take one step at a time ... <br>  <br>  The first step is to leave the husband & get into your own place. Since you are attending school, you should check with your college's counseling center and see if they might be able to assist you in finding a reasonable place that you can afford ...|`|AA12382198	Sorry....you asked a question and I have to judge.<br>  <br>  Your first sentence is a lie.....and you know it.<br>  <br>  He's not a good husband...he's abusive, he drinks too much....and you have feelings for someone else.<br>  <br>  Go back home....finish growing up.....finish school....and then decide who you want to spend your life with. Hopefully you haven't met him yet.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	how can we answer your questions w/out making a judgment? people can do so w/out being rude ya know.<br>  <br>  honestly it doesn't sound like your husband is a "good man" at all. i spent way too much time married to a man that was verbally and emotionally abusive. i left a lot to be w/him, and i lost a lot to be rid of him but i can tell you this much. it was worth it! i'm happier now and i have no regrets.<br>  <br>  your husband doesn't sound like he's providing a very secure environment for a baby to be in...that's just crazy to even think about it.<br>  before you start jumping into a new relationship w/anyone you need to get your own butt in line. get to know yourself first and where you want to head. that's the biggest mistake most women make, they hop from one guy to the next becoming totally lost in the shuffle. then one day they wake up and wonder HOW the hell did i get here?!|`|egpVC6uMaa	You have too many issues and I don't think you have any idea what you want.. your ex probably wants you now because you are taken and your husband sounds like as azzhole, but using him to complete your education doesn't make you any better. Bottom line, you are not ready for a relationship, right now...you have too much on your plate.<br>  <br>  Get a divorce, go home and finish school. It will come to you...there is no rush in love. You have the rest of your life for that|`|rrWhhiMEaa	You could... but think first about what problems in your life it will solve, and what problems it will cause.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have decided to leave your husband but the question is simply when. Have you talked to him about that? Try to distance yourself as much as possible, until you can leave. Don't bring a baby into that situation!<br>  <br>  Make sure you arent running to the other guy just because you are unhappy. If you think things could work out, see what he thinks. Be careful not to get hurt or get into a worse situation than you are now.<br>  If school is the only issue, try to find a solution, like maybe transferring after this semester.|`|Po1QAWTnaa	obviously you have no self esteem or you wouldnt have stayed in the first place! stand up for women and get the hell outta there if you let it continue then your accepting it  leaving the first time! Who in there right mind wants to be treated that way!?! Get out now or you obivously enjoy it and i hope that no kids are involved in such in envoirment bc they deft dont need to be around it!|`|z4iETkpsaa	Have you told your parents about his emotionally abusive ways? Do you have friends nearby?<br>  <br>  Obviously the solution to this problem would be to leave your husband. And not because of some other guy that you had known before and are suddenly rekindling feelings and a desire to be in a relationship with. But for the simple fact that he does not know how to treat you very well. Why settle? <br>  <br>  If you two have only been married for a couple years and you are already having all these problems, not to be a pessimist but- it's only going to get worse.<br>  <br>  I don't quite see the problem here..   you've established what it is you don't like, now you just have to do something about it. <br>  <br>  If you were to leave your husband, why couldn't you just work/ get a full time job.  Get an apt with a roommate? Why go the extreme of moving back in with parents? It's not like you have children which definitely complicates things ( as is in my case) ..   I'm sure you can find a way to make this work and stay in the same state.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	If he is not treating you well, leave him.  Plain and simple.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	I won't judge, although I don't agree with cheating for any reason. <br>  If you really want to cheat, then that there is enough for you to realize that you aren't in love with your husband and therefore you shouldn't even be with him. Why cheat? Why not just get a divorce and be single to do what you want, and whom you want? That's the best advice you are going to get from anyone.

c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	Okay so what you know about yourself is that you are a dancer, and you are sensitive to what is going on in your school, and respectful of someones death. <br>  <br>  What does it matter if someone else says you are something you know you are not? People who know you will know you are not emo, and people are able to see with their own eyes what you are and are not. I mean you don't want to be seen as a scene jumper, but the best thing to do would to just ignore it, and don't show you are upset. <br>  <br>  If he says "ha ha ha you are so emo" <br>  say something like "Okay, whatever you say. Can I get back to my work now?" <br>  or "You interrupted me for that? don't you have anything real to say?" <br>  <br>  Don't show your upset, don't show you care, and next time he goes off for no good reason make him feel like the add retard that he is.|`|3Dhacs6caa	show them ur wrists, and if they're not cut then ur not emo!

qbZKBSFHaa	When I was younger and not married (16-21), I had a band on my ring finger to keep guys from approaching me or to get a guy off my *** who couldn't take a hint! I've never been into the strange guy that I've never met coming over to introduce himself to ask me for my name and number.  It seemed unrealistic to me, I believed in being acquainted more than once or twice for a real, sincere connection, wasn't looking for anyone who thought I "looked hot and wasn't wearing a wedding band!" Long story short, it weeded out the wierdos who were only out to get my goodies. <br>  <br>  Just ask her, you won't know until you do and she won't be offended, unless she has something to hid.|`|TBiQ1CGVaa	Some women do it to repell men. Some do it just because they feel like it. If you want to ask her out, go for it. If she is engaged or married, oh well, move on.<br>  <br>  I don't see why its a big deal to wear a ring on your ring finger if you're not engaged or married. Who cares? It's not that uncommon.|`|G2tXZgrPaa	My cousin wears a ring on her ring finger when she goes to the bar.<br>  She says it's so guys see her finger and leave her alone. Or if they try to hit on her she can just flash the ring instead of making up a story.|`|eWMn7dhKaa	Makes people like you second-guess yourselves before asking them to go out.  ^_^<br>  <br>  Seems to me that you have already answered your own question.|`|LAx5rfm4aa	just ask .she just may say yes .done be embarrassed . if she say no . say sorry . and be happy|`|sA7DuUUBaa	its a common way for females to decive males as its womand favorit confections decite and usery to gain access to there wallets only to move on to the big with the biger dollar and next next etc|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	I've never known any woman to do that. Maybe on their right hand but not their left. <br>  chances are if she has a ring on that finger, she doesn't want to be bothered.|`|49da283ad6f82d6c3ae5e2b5847bbf08aa	I know a lesbian who wears one to avoid men hitting on her.|`|AA10873763	Because they like rings, maybe?<br>  It's not the defining part of a woman's life any more, marriage.  Some women just like the jewelry.  And some married women don't wear rings. <br>  You'll just have to ask her.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	I wear it just so I won't get approached by other men sometimes it doesn't work.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	When I was single and would wear a ring on my left ring-finger, it was because I didn't want to get hit on.  Simple as that.  It would literally go on everytime I went out to the bar with my girlfriends.  I was out to have fun with my friends and just relax/have a couple beers, not get hit on by some a hole who smells of tequilla and can't even stand up straight....or doesn't get the point when I would politely tell him I was not interested.|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Some women do it so they don't get hit on.  Or maybe they're  not married but they are in a committed relationship nonetheless.  You know what??  Honey, just ask her out.  If she IS married, she'll tell you.  Its not a bad reflection on you at all.  We never know until we try.  Why not try?  Right now you're not dating her and if she's single, maybe  you will be!  Just go ahead and ask and respect whatever she answers.  That's all we really need anyhow and want...a little respect.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	To keep guys like you from constantly hitting on them.<br>  <br>  Why don't you just ask her (or one of her friends)  if she's married?|`|f6YsGOynaa	1) She's a nun.<br>  2) She doesn't want to get hit on by creeps.|`|LjV0MTQYaa	Left hand ring finger is the married hand. If she has a lot of rings on, maybe it's just another ring. Look if it's a wedding/engagement ring, usually there's a difference between those and a casual ring. Also, maybe she's wearing it because she's not interested in a relationship. Some women do that.<br>  <br>  Talk to her and see if she mentions a husband or boyfriend or something. If not, casually ask her.|`|FmvnC8keaa	There are many explanations to this question. The ring may have belonged to someone she loved and they passed away or gave this as a sentimental gift; she may still not be over her last divorce and is still in the "denile stage, she doesn't want to get hit on by creeps or someone she just doesnt want to get hit on by, she really is married, she may like diamonds, maybe she just likes wearing rings, or maybe the ring looks good with her outfit!|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Sometimes women are not interested in being picked up by alot of losers that are out there so they wear a ring to avoid having to deal with those type of guys.Also,they just may be content in their lives and dont want to be in a relationship so they wear it so guys will think they are in a relationship.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	I had a ring that belonged to my grandmother, but it only fit on my ring finger of my left hand....i still wore it, course i'm married now and wear a wedding ring. i've found though, that some guys just do not care if you have a ring on they still hit on you! lol<br>  <br>  it's just a ring, if there is a meaning behind it that information will be given. just suck it up and ask.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Honesty works. Just try talking to her (nothing flirtatious in case she is married) and work around to asking if she is married...or just come right out with it.<br>  <br>  I wore a ring on my ring finger for 6 years to keep men from asking me out. I did so because I was focusing on myself and did not want a man interfering. When I was ready to date again then I took it off.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	to awarding themselves of all the good things that they have done and accomplish in their mile stone.  also to show the world of their success.|`|5r2Csdzwaa	Those DOLTS like the green infection that's caused by wearing them.|`|tb0NMaooaa	because we can!
uiQGzWLFaa	Guy that make you laugh are great, it's best when they aren't really awkward around you. Just act funny, or be yourself if that's your personality. Girls like guys who don't need to pretend to be someone else.
ZKcg7YV8aa	This situation can be hard, but sit back and relax. It is very normal for parents to get involved with your marriage and everything else, especially if you live with them. Try to ignore them as much as possible, and don't be rude, as they may take it out against you. Since at this moment you need to live with them, try to cope with the situation until everything gets back to normal and you can move out!<br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11460234	That is an issue for your husband to address. In addition as long as you meet the requirements they've set (rent, utilities, groceries, etc) then you're not beholden to them when it comes to finances or how you spend your money. Unless its recklessly and they can see financial ruin on the horizon. I hardly think flowers will send you to the almshouse.<br>  <br>  However, next time hubby brings you flowers and they make a fuss, have hubby say that they were for nothing. He was driving by a cemetery, saw a fresh grave, pulled in and after cutting off the ribbon that read "Mother" brought them home to you before they wilted.<br>  <br>  that oughta shut 'em up.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	your husband should talk to them in private...just because u live there, doesn't give them the right to dictate how you bring up your children. i live with my mum and my husband and baby, and she helps but doesn't interfere. that's how it should be. he needs to explain that u are grateful to them, and although u love their support with the children, this doesn't mean they have a right to comment on your finances. u pay your way.|`|c696f477a4d1a069e6273b7aae58b19daa	You need to get out of there!  Can't you get a small place with the money you pay them?  Paying them is outrageous if you ask me!  Your marriage is going to go down the drain if what you are describing continuous and your children wont be raised happy either.<br>  Other option...wait for them to die..maybe of sudden death?.. and inherit the house.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Move out.

That's how you should deal with the frustrations: get out. It's hard to pity you when you should never have allowed this to happen.

This helps to start something.  Your husband needs to learn to relax.  He needs to be grounded for you.  If both of you are freaking out like this that is not good.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Well, he ought to be carrying two bowling balls around. How selfish could he be?<br>  <br>  Babies come when they're ready to be born. Who told your husband that your baby would come when he expected it? Patience is a virtue and a newborn requires it.<br>  <br>  I've never heard of such a thing, a DAD who's freaking out. Jeez.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Nipple stimulation is scientifically proven and most doctors will corroborate this evidence.  This will stimulate the production of oxytocin in your body.  Oxytocin is the same hormone that they give a woman (in the synthetic form of Pitocin) to induce labor.  This is the hormone that is released when nursing and causes the uterus to contract.  If your cervix is dilating and softening, then this will help get the process rolling.  (The progestin from your husband's seminal fluid will aid in softening the cervix.)<br>  <br>  Since you're already at your due date, you should see if you can get an appointment with a certified, licensed massage therapist who is trained in prenatal massage.  This will relax you, make you more comfortable and less irritable, and may even stimulate labor.  <br>  <br>  From a bodywork perspective, if you rub the insides of your ankles, this is an acupressure point for stimulation of labor.  This is not necessarily scientifically proven, but the massage and nipple stimulation techniques are.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	Well honestly i think most answer you are getting are from people that weren't that husband. I was my Wife was pregnant and I also had the ability to get paid paternity leave thank goodness. My wife was a WEEK past due when she finally had our daughter and once the day came when she was supposed to be due i was ready to jump in deal with the pregnancy and the child after its born. But its the waiting we have problems with the thinking something is wrong when things don't happen on time.He is going to worry and be foolish when the child is being born as well. He is just being a good husband and soon to be father. Sex 5-6 times a Week lordy i wouldn't have every to be stressed out. Your doing every thing you can to help it naturally progress. If you want to help him relax tell him to stop being worried because every thing is fine and tell him you need him to step up right now to be a sturdy rock i know it's hard to do i was there. But he needs to start keeping his stressed bottled up for a bit or go to the gym (i went to the gym to distress). When the baby is born you will be super tierd and he will have to look after the new one for the next 2 days while you are in the hospital bed. Also you can try kegle exercises.<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/kegel-exercises/WO00119" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/kegel-e...</a><br>  All i can do it just let you know and for you to let him know every thing is alright i am not only a husband, father but i am also a doctor as well. Every thing is fine. I wish you the best and a happy birth.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	You're funny.  First you give me some good answers to my questions over time, now this.  You're too nice.  <br>  <br>  My wife didn't give a rat's crap *** about me during her pregancy.  In fact, I don't think 10 years later she would ever think like you do.  If my wife were to give you advice, she would tell you to take care of yourself, ask him for whatever you need, expect him to guess correctly at everything else, and then just forget about him after the baby comes, except when you need something else from him.<br>  <br>  I don't think I got sex 6 times the entire YEAR she was pregnant with our first kid.<br>  <br>  You're a gem.  Take it easy.  You're husband will be fine.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Well, you can do what my then-wife did to me to get me to relax.<br>  She grabbed me by the collar, got in my face and said:"STOP YOUR WHINING... YOU DID THIS TO MEEEEEEE!!!!"  as she kneed me in the sack, knocking me out.<br>  It worked, and being unconscious is pretty relaxing for everyone.<br>  <br>  Best of luck for a happy and safe birth!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	You sound like a typical first time mom freaking out.  This is one of life's lessons - the first of many you are about to learn...it's called patience.  Work on it because children require a lot of it...|`|rawz0RJuaa	having sex sex sex is the best way to induce labor naturally at this point- plus as a bonus it will relax you both!<br>  good luck and congrats!!<br>  <br>  ADD- k just saw your added details <br>  if sex isnt doing it, maybe there is a reason.<br>  he should be ejaculating as deep into you as possible (semen encourages labor) and you should be having as many orgasms as possible (also encourages labor)
LjV0MTQYaa	it's actually an instict. Boobs show the man that the woman is mature and able to bear children (even if the man doesn't want children). Same thing with hips. The curves are attractive because it means the woman is mature and ready to "mate". Remember that humans are animals, too.<br>  <br>  Also, it gives us women definition. Men don't have hips because they don't need them, therefore women are more like women if they have curves, because men don't. If that makes sense. It's like this: Men don't have boobs, women do. Men who are not attracted to men like the significant difference in the bodies and it's what makes a woman, a woman.<br>  <br>  Hoped that help.|`|3GHXk05saa	They remind them of their mamas.|`|dL2SelcBaa	they're just awesome.|`|YW74O9aNaa	They don't have them :) as simple as that!|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Dunno but not all men are obsessed with them.  My boyfriend is more of a leg man, mind you he does say i do have lovely boobs too, bless him (he is my biggest fan lol).<br>  <br>  I think it's because they can not only play with them they can snuggle up to them.  And ours are nicer than theirs lol|`|2b00d7f4f64f535fc8e847cb8fe3d6e0aa	One cannot explain it just like many other mysteries in life.|`|CS6lcyBpaa	SQUISHY!|`|0lACfoXSaa	They have to be nice boobs.

8FbOtXAXaa	She needs to just stay away from this guy no matter what. If she is that scared that he is going to try to do something with her then she really needs to avoid him. Also, if she wants to go somewhere and she knows that he might be there she needs to bring a few of her trusted friends with her so that she is not alone. Sounds like this guy will just get her into a lot of bad stuff that she doesn't need. Let her know that these type of guys just want to have sex and move on to the next girl. For one thing, its not safe knowing how many STD infected people there are out there and I would really hate to see your friend fall into something horrible like that.Just let her know how you feel and let her read this:) Hope she stays safe and stays around people that she trusts.|`|LaXtzPhPaa	well tell her to follow her heart theres better people then him but my sister said he sounds like her type|`|VeOIX86kaa	DONT GO!!!

b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	With todays society becoming more and more unsure with the economy, protecting one property by whatever means isnt as tacky as it appears. Home robberies and burglaries are on the rise and it wont get any better any time soon so it makes good sense. 6 foot fences are harder to climb over as even here in Florida, alligators can scale 4 foot chain link fences but not 6 foot ones yet. So personally, its better to look tacky then to lose all ones property to someone else. I hope this was a question asked to save your marriage to be asked in this category.|`|4cdq26oraa	Tacky!!!  Sorry but unless you are trying to keep deer or kangaroos out of your yard, a 6ft fence is just going to look like there's something wrong with your neighborhood and kill the re-sale value (if that matters). If he really wants a 6ft fence, put in a wood fence. While it may take a little longer and be a slight bit more expensive, it will look 100% nicer and give you some privacy at the same time.|`|15ad66d7bc3151bfa1bbf08f596456caaa	Tacky - tacky - tacky - <br>  <br>  throw in some pink flamingos and you'll be set|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Not tacky - if it serves a purpose like keeping the dogs in...if it's just for a barrier, there are other (nicer looking) options out there.|`|xzQhXCCaaa	Tacky|`|kNscpF4Faa	I have that 6ft fence around my large yard all the way around with a rolling gate at driveway....I have a boxer and they can JUMP..I don't think it is tacky|`|fznvQptlaa	tacky...|`|YM1zhtKEaa	I love It It will keep out those nosy nieghbors|`|XI74yGYUaa	why not lasers?!|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	There are ordinances regarding the kind of fence you can have and where you can put it, Check with the city to see what you are allowed.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	To each his own. In some neighborhoods, having a fence is considered lucky.|`|OG4410bdaa	not tacky- functional<br>  especially if you have dogs or kids that you want to keep in,<br>  or if your neighbors have dogs that you want to keep out<br>  <br>  there are other options if you don't like the way chain-link looks<br>  but a wooden fence can actually be very expensive and requires more yearly up-keep|`|cGbTJobeaa	Do you mean around the entire house or just the side and back yard?<br>  <br>  I've never seen a 6' tall one; just a 4' tall one.  The 6' tall fences I've seen are the privacy fences where you cannot see into the neighbor's yard at all.|`|AA10986891	Tacky|`|b36106fca96cf87563f99284c771ece2aa	Yes, I think the 6 foot chain link fence AND the green hair are both tacky.|`|29hcn9JRaa	A chain link fence around your home, is he crazy? I am doing a mental visual of it, and what I can picture in my mind is that it is going to stick out like a sour thumb, basically this chain link fence will be the first thing everyone see's when they come over, and first impressions are known to either make you, or break you. A chain link fence around the house is basically to much, it will appear as overwhelming and very unfriendly appearing, as chain link fences are associated with prison and mental institutions. So coming from one woman to another, I am on your side with this one, don't allow your husband to take your home and make it look like the outside of a prison, ugh.|`|m2jeeo4Laa	My dad has a chain link fence in his backyard that he put up in the eighties.  Most of the people in the neighborhood have chain link, so not only am I used to it, but it matches.  In our neighborhood, most of the houses have the wooden fences.  So, my guess would be to go down some alleys and see what is going on around your area and maybe call a realtor and ask if putting one up would affect your property negatively.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	In urban cities it's common.  In suburbs not so.  In my neighborhood there are a couple of homes with wooden fences all the way around and I don't like it, it looks alienating.  If someone is that bent on keeping other people away then I think they should move way out to a farm or something.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, just get an alarm system and put the fence only in the backyard.|`|naequcqlaa	Yes, I've seen it at many places, BUT a nice wood fence adds so much more to a place.  It can be left either natural or it can be stained.  Wooden fences do add so much more to a place in my estimation.  Both of course do the same thing, but I'll go for the better look to me.  Good luck w/your situation tho...:)|`|2d98c2bb1f91687f4c39b7eaa00a89c9aa	I think a wooden fence would be nicer. I think he wants some extra protection and privacy.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Maybe attractiveness, or lack thereof, has nothing to do with why your husband wants it.  I think you'd be doing yourself a favor if you found out why he wants it.|`|5r2Csdzwaa	If you live around a bunch of DOLT dope dealers and crack or meth smokers, its a brilliant idea!|`|iZbgUtxcaa	If you are living in an area of increasing crime, it makes sense.
wb8WwWMNaa	Either bail OR...<br>  <br>  Find games that you two can play together, buy one or two as a gift for him.  Try getting involved in the things he enjoys, but if he's a jerk about it, then you can definitely bail on him.  I hate dudes that play with their video games more than their girlfriends, so lame!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10152966	Just do what I did and explain to him that it bothers you. I did this with my husband and it worked great! Just tell him you don't want him to STOP altogether, but just cut back a little and give you more attention. Hope this helps and good luck...just don't expect an overnight change!|`|kulDK5jsaa	If your boyfriend is addicted to a one player game, he is an antisocial ****** who should be targeted for elimination.<br>  Otherwise, it might just be bros before hoes.|`|ES8af3HQaa	lmao do wht i did get ridda him not the xbox :) worked out well :P|`|ZKLlTxd0aa	You should get rid of him.

But as we've gotten closer and we're getting older, we've talked about it and he said he's not scared of the subject at all.

Good Luck!|`|Qnop8tkjaa	*Make sure another person goes along with you. You'll definitely want an opinion aside from the consultant's. However, don't make the mistake of taking your mother, your maid of honor, your bridesmaid, your other bridesmaid, and your other bridesmaid's little sister. Not only will they get in the way, but none of them will all agree on anything, and mostly likely, at least one of them won't like whatever dress you're trying on. It's probably best to take one person (or maybe two, like your mother and maid of honor), whose opinion you trust and value.<br>  * If you're allowed, take a camera (preferably digital) with you to take snapshots of the dresses you love the most so you can keep a record of them. You'll probably try on many dresses during your search, and you'll probably quickly forget the details of each dress as you try on the next one you love. Having photos helps you remember and compare them later so you can narrow down your choice. If you can't take photos, keep a list of the designer and dress number or name so you can look them up online and save the photos that way.<br>  * Take along a bottle of water or something else hydrating. Trying on dresses can turn into a time-consuming experience, and it can also be a workout, so make sure you bring a beverage. Just be sure to keep it away from the dresses.<br>  * Photos of dresses you found online or in magazines, if you have any. Even if they're dresses made by another designer, the shop you're in may be able to help you look for something similar. A lot of chains have styles that bear a resemblance to dresses by an expensive designer as a cheaper alternative for brides with smaller budgets.<br>  * If you've already decided to wear a certain item (such as a specific pair of shoes, veil, or jewelry) because it has sentimental value, take the item along with you. If it's absolutely necessary that you wear it on your wedding day, you'll want to make sure the dress you choose goes well with it (though this may narrow your options considerably).|`|IDlPFVNDaa	look at dresses u would never imagine wearing its always the one u dont think youd wear.. and yes bring your shoes.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	Definitely bring heels with you.  Also, try on a couple styles completely different from what you think you may like.  You may be pleasantly surprised.|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	I suggest going and finding a style you like on yourself then finding a pattern and a seamstress to do a replica.  This alone saved me about $3,000 in the dress department.  Plus that way it fits you like a glove, you can add details, etc.....  Oh, and don't forget to take pictures of yourself in a few styles you like.  It comes in handy later.

Do you like living with your mum or dad. I know its not as simple as that. And sometimes we look for something we should not know. Maybe there is a reason your mum and dad never told you the real reasons for their divorce to protect you, my dad hurt my mum but he would never physically hurt me although some times its the things that he has done hurts the most. But do not make any decisions while in shock you might regret it later calm down first and really think about it can you live with your dad knowing that he hurt your mum? It will take time.|`|zQB0kEmcaa	It sounds like your mum has a few problems ( depression, abandoning the home etc...).  When people are upset they imagine/exaggerate things - maybe she is saying some things about your dad because she wants a divorce/is depressed/confused !!!  Would she have left you if she thought he was dangerous!!!  I think not ....  It is strange that she left you, though ...  If I were you I would speak to someone outside of the family such as a counsellor or (if you are in school) someone at the school...  What goes on between a mum and dad is often concealed from the kids ( although not always, but in your case I think yes ....)  Your dad may seem gentle to you but he may behave differently with your mum - who knows ?!!<br>  Really, though, speak to someone outside of the family and get their opinion.

If anything starts changing and you get scared, get OUT immediately!<br>  <br>  If your mom didn't offer to take you with her, it may be for a reason.  Try talking with her about why, without accusing.  She respected you enough not to share the details of the divorce.  Respect her decision and make up your own mind about each parent.  I respect her a LOT for deciding not to drag you into it.  If your dad starts in with you about your mom, go live with her.  That's emotional abuse in and of itself.<br>  <br>  Again, don't go into the details with either parent.  Try to remember that they both love you, and have to know how difficult this is for you.<br>  <br>  Because you shouldn't be talking with either of them about their side of the divorce, go see a psychologist - someone who is bound by patient confidentiality - so that you CAN talk this all out with someone.  This is difficult to go through alone, sweetie.<br>  <br>  Hugs!!!|`|ZooFCqMjaa	angel,sweetie if your dad was that bad tour mum would not of left you with your dad (even if it was your choice to stay ) ,the only thing i can advise you to do is ask her ,about it.andther thing i dont understand is how come you didnt even have an inkling about it ? did you ever hear any arguments or anything ? ,you know hunny sometimes grown ups lie to get what they want ,weather its true or not ,dont worry about it ,the only way yo can find out is ask them.do you have an auntie or a nan that you can ask? or if not can you get them to help you ask your mum and dad about it. i hope my  advice has helped you even just a little bit,you shouldnt have to be dealing with things like this at your age hunny,good luck and i wish you well godbless|`|up4CNbs9aa	What I don't understand is why your mom didn't take you with her when she left if your father was that abusive to her. Now I've never read your other questions, so I'm gonna ask... are your parents divorced or did your mom just leave?<br>  <br>  I would say if you feel unsafe and if what your father did to your mom has to that terrified of him then you need to leave that house and go live with your mom. <br>  <br>  If your parents aren't yet divorced, chances are custody of you will be granted to your mother by the judge when he hears your mother's reasons for wanting the divorce (provided she opens up about the abuse). I do know that most time custody gets awarded to the mom anyway, unless there is some reason she is found not fit to care for the child, but I don't know anything about you or your family so I really can't say much else.<br>  <br>  I think you need to talk to your mom, one on one. Tell her you found the word document and that it really scared you. Ask her to talk to you about it... if your father is that bad you need to leave because I honestly don't think you'll be safe there.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, hang in there.|`|c52c780b69eb4e6373e1f3123cb1f3bbaa	you don't know the full story. I intend to destroy my partner over a long period for murdering our child in an abortion clinic, but also be as good a father as i can to our baby.|`|FAIgH1Deaa	im 16 too and it must be hard finding that. i would tell my mum that you've found the microsoft word document and she'll help you <br>  <br>  x <br>  <br>  your mum is always your rock, so trust her.|`|YpPUHw8Saa	talk to your dad about it and see if he denys it but have a friend with you or something incase he turns out to get all mad and wants to hurt you i would say move wit your mom sounds safer there|`|hQmZP38qaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear about your situation, but things will get better.<br>  <br>  I use to be involved with men that were physically abusive and I left them.  I am better than that and deserve to be treated like a woman.<br>  You should be very proud of your mom for making the decision she did, because nowadays too many women stay with men that hit them or are emotionally abuse to them.  All that does it make you feel less of a person.<br>  <br>  Now I don't know the whole story of what you are going through, but from what you are telling me, in my opinion I think you should be with your mother, she needs you just as much as you need her.<br>  <br>  Learn from her situation, and don't allow other men in your life to treat you any less than the women you are now.  You know, some times people don't seem who they are until later down the road they see their true colors.<br>  <br>  Just give your situation to God and let him deal with it.  God will always be by your side no matter what the situation is, so don't ever feel like your going through this alone.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you out and have a blessed weekend.
NQFV2AdZaa	People's priorities change once they fall in love, so i guess it could work out once they got to know each other better. Maybe she is the one for him and would change his life forever, i think he should give it a go!|`|JJMa25NWaa	they have different desires, but you'll never know until you try.
517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Not if they're shy.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	If I liked her,I would pursue her.|`|unlpwEDMaa	If a guy sees any bit sign that a girl is interested, most guys go for it with all they got...<br>  But every now and then you run into those guys that just pursue, persue, persue to the point were the girl needs a restraining order.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	i can't speak for all men, but if we think something is even slightly in doubt then we won't try it<br>  <br>  when it comes to women anyway|`|vwoqIUR6aa	yes I would say most guys do pursue a girl they really, really like.|`|8SKpsVG7aa	no Id just move on|`|D7JZPxDzaa	yah i wouldn't, i'd just order my food and jack off instead|`|tvWm1e4naa	some men pursue the women they really like.  they will really show and tell you that their intention is real. will come to visit you at home and meet your parents and will mention marriage.<br>  some men are not man enough to show and tell their feelings esp. if the woman is  in a better position in life than him. so if you really like the guy, you have to do something about like do the first move. <br>  i want a more straightforward man, if i like the man.<br>  if i don't like the man, he can keep his feelings for me forever and better be be friends with me.|`|b33NeBAbaa	It depends on the guy's confidence level really.  I do have to say that persistence DOES pay off.  If you like a girl enough, and keep showing it, she will start thinking about you and good things will happen. Believe me.|`|ukTR7KNSaa	Personally, I don't like to play games.  If she is already playing games before we even start dating, there would probably too much drama in the relationship for me.|`|773a0ef61688dd825e941d816e68d310aa	To the point of hopelessness.|`|FzFSzilmaa	if she shows disinterest, we are out of there!!!<br>  <br>  if she shows some interest, then there is a possibility of sex... that is good enough... :D|`|dxeOlRBfaa	some guys like the thrill of the chase but once they make the capture sometimes they feel its not worth it|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Yes|`|dfbc3f35da98132143b605b02d89e5b9aa	yes we do|`|YNd65b3kaa	.  It's variously called 'being smitten and 'worshiping the ground she walks on'.  Been there, done that.  Sometimes the woman is flattered and gives in and sometimes the guy is just not her cup of tea.<br>  <br>     Frequently, the woman is simply involved with someone else but likes to string someone else along.<br>  <br>     If the guy can take rejection for a while, a woman will sometimes relent and try to find something she likes about her pursuer and it may eventually work out.<br>  <br>     When to break off?  Generally when you lose that feelin'.|`|fb5d7O6Saa	Very few pursue women they like or even one that they know like them. From my experience with guys, they don't go out of their way to pursue a woman regardless the circumstance. Most of them fear rejection and will let it go rather than go after her. It could be the fear of rejection issue or just lack of drive to put forth the effort.<br>  I think they should put aside the fear and pursue. A lot of good women get passed up that way (wink wink)|`|H3h4j4aKaa	yes they do and they even sabatouge other men to get you just ask my husband lol i was in love with this other man and my now husband told me that this other man had a girlfriend and all this hoopla and i got so upset and he was like it's ok i am here just tell me all your problem... yup that's how he got me... lol and he doesn't care that he sabatouged another man he said he would have done anything to get me :) i think i picked the right guy he really wanted me x)|`|1ixHcHqEaa	Like drag his friends to the same local bar EVERY damn weekend for like three years because he is absolutely infatuated with her?

zWYfAWSOaa	They are excited about the baby.  If your family was engaged and interested sort, you would have a proper measuring stick for your in-laws behavior.  Since your family is so aloof your in-laws excitement is a totally foreign language. Is your child the first grandchild?  Normal people tend to get overexcited about that.<br>  <br>  After the baby comes, you will be so grateful that you have in-laws interested enough to give you a break from being constantly on-duty mommy. (It is exhausting!)  They won't be so interested in you, you are correct it is the baby they are interested in.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest you simply request your mom-in-law to refrain from touching your belly so much.  Tell her you aren't that comfortable right now.
CzS1EiV9aa	Be very careful about girls who give you mixed signals.  But if she comes to you naked you need to respond with action.  What were you waiting for.|`|xAwk4dZ3aa	lol she wants you back as simple as it gets|`|bWgF0NoTaa	hey, i answered one of your other questions.. thanks for the 10 points!..<br>  <br>  first off, with the phone.. she is basically checking to see if you have any new numbers, meaning girls.. but she trusts you enough to look through hers.. she most likely wants to get back together, considering it's been 2 months that you've been apart.. BUT.. i would suggest taking more time away from each other, maybe another few months or so, and just visit occasionally..<br>  <br>  for example, my ex and me see each other once or twice a week and we actually hung out tonight for a couple of hours, but he doesn't want to get back.. we're just friends.. the sad part is we flirt with each other, but that's as far as it goes.. it hurts b/c a part of me wants to get back with him, but another part of me doesn't.. it's confusing.. if he asked me to get back, i probably would.. i don't even know.. but why would you pay someone compliments and flirt if you don't want a relationship?.. <br>  <br>  if your ex is jumping on top of you naked, then i would take that as a mixed signal.. make sure she knows what she wants before YOU get hurt.. mainly, b/c you're the one who wants to get back together..  either she is waiting for you to make the first move on her, or else she is having fun toying with your emotions.. don't make yourself vulnerable and fall for it.. make sure that she is sincere about everything..<br>  <br>  good luck.. hopefully, you'll get back together.. it seems as if you two have better chances at it than my ex and me..

If she refused then his only way is to hire a lawyer...|`|09Y8F6hQaa	You have two choices, hire an attorney, and he gets divorced, or don't, and he stays married.  Which do you choose?  Hiring an attorney, wont be expensive, in this case, because she is a drug user who abandoned him.   Most likely, all he'd have to do is try to locate her, punish an add in the paper, send a certified letter to her address or the address of a relative and with a certain amount of time, if she doesn't respond, a judge will declare him divorced.  Lawyers take Visa too.  So, you make that choice.|`|ppF6oSCQaa	she doesn't have to sign papers for him to get a divorce.  he should know this and if he doesn't, it could mean that he doesn't want to get a divorce at all and is using this as an excuse for you.|`|TPhIWWniaa	He should contact the Legal Aid Office in his state, they could advice him on how to do it alone or do it for him for a small fee or free.|`|AA10199949	The judge can sine off on papers and they can just for that reason. He can go to the court house and get free legal help with the entire divorce and then he can move forward.|`|81wvN8Rraa	He just needs to take the necessary steps to find her like posting an ad in the paper etc. He needs to talk with a lawyer but may not need one to acctually take care of the paperwork.|`|4RgXh3ftaa	He can file without her.. if he tells you other wise than that means HE STILL WANTS TO BE MARRIED.|`|y6HmMl9naa	Get a good lawyer !!!!!!!!!!!!

I should not cost any more than a regular with no children or property to split.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	Join Pre-Paid Legal or try Legal Aid in your area.  I think in this case he has to run an ad in the paper and then he can get a divorce but you are definitely going to need an attorney.  Also, it isn't good that you are calling her a nut job and a heroin addict.  You really don't know her and you are going on what he says, she may not be any of those things.  You never know.|`|bgVYiBHOaa	It depends what state you live in and what court you're going to. In some states, you have to get a lawyer. In others, there are variations to what you can do.|`|LAx5rfm4aa	keep dateing him|`|th7C1aoaaa	Depends on the state. Should really ask a lawyer.
YWib1tlQaa	Be up to date with the language. Try learning 'Net Speak', such as "OMG!" "LOL" or "C U," or "C U L8R" to make you send your messages faster. (Oh my God/Gosh, Laughing out Loud, See you and See you Later) <br>  Use symbols when talking such as  :) - XD - =) -  ;) (Be creative). <br>  Try to make inside jokes between you and the person you're attempting to flirt with. <br>  Connect in anyway possible, example, talk about common interests. <br>  Compliment the other and show off, for instance, if they say "Hey whats up" reply, "hey cutie, im getting ready to go to the gym" (or whatever seems right). <br>  Try to keep the conversation going. <br>  If the conversation reaches a dull point, and you can't think of a way to get out of it. Just say "alright i g2g ttyl <3 or ?" <br>  Say their name sometimes, just not too much or it may getting annoying. EX. "Joe! That's a great idea!" <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't try to get someone to like you just over text messages. <br>  Be constant; don't flirt just over the phone and not in person, because he'll think you're joking. <br>  If they have to leave for a minute, don't keep texting them until they get back; it's annoying and seems clingy. <br>  As with all flirting, don't come on too strong. <br>  Call him babe or babey sum times, <br>  if your saying good nyte to flirt while saying good nite you can say stuff like, "okay babe nytenyte ily babey, xx" IT WORKES TRUST ME <br>  also dont be too pushy and dont sai i like u ova a text that freekes them out <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be careful who you let read your text messages. <br>  Don't just ramble on. Being boring is anti-flirting. <br>  Don't always be the one to text first. Let him text you first once in a while, because he could get annoyed. <br>  Check your spelling and grammar. You don't want him/her to misunderstand what you wrote and take it the wrong way, or not even understand what you meant at all.|`|lokj06Euaa	use exclamation marks and smiles :) they always work --<br>  <br>  exclamations show your excited to talk to them and smiles show that you are happy to talk to them and are being cute/flirting with them.<br>  <br>  say cutsie things like oh bla bla bla would be better if you were there or came with me. or try saying things like i miss you. lets hang out soon! and be interested in what he has to say ... be interested in the things hes doing... youll be fine.|`|t2W9GGjdaa	Always make sure that what you send requires a reply before you hit send.<br>  <br>  Something like 'Yeah, OK" doen't need a response..So he will be left wondering what to say and then decide to wait for you to say something.<br>  <br>  So you will be waitng, waiting....|`|zOrizG35aa	Truth game is always fun.<br>  It's how I got my first boyfriend.<br>  :]]]]<br>  Ask flirty questions.|`|h8mjz3puaa	umm.. say things like soo.. wat are u wearing.. and then when he asks u tell him am getn dressd.. ask him dumb things like.. u lukd hot today or..do u see me as an attractive persun little things like dat..|`|H2tkkWyPaa	I normally do this, ;)  I also just kinda text things that I would say while I was flirting.|`|9d8u0rqOaa	Always put a kiss towards the end like "muah".|`|WRFi5ekaaa	text hey sexy with a wink face..;)|`|ns7p5hBGaa	say you miss them or that you can't wait to see them again. be sweet|`|J5jI6VDvaa	Texting- Always use ;)<br>  <br>  Talking- BITE THAT LIP 'TIL IT BLEEDS!|`|wFWytGlxaa	Whatever comes off the top of your head, do it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|zfKzLFgxaa	use a lotta smiley faces :) or when he asks you what youre doing, say "nothin,  just layin in bed... wanna join me?" lol THEN he'll definitely know you like him and depending on what he says back, you will know if he like you back or not|`|fb5d7O6Saa	Start by complimenting him on something you like about him.

Let him know that you are unhappy and unsatisfied.<br>  Let him know what he can do to change all that too.<br>  Failing that take him to a strip club and help him get horny, then take him home, and find the young stud trapped inside that you fell in love with.  Praise him on his sexual prowess after this event.  Then make sure to turn him on in return he must do the same.  <br>  A good idea is to whisper in his ear if he is in the missionary position, tell him what you want, tease him, make him want the same.  Believe me if his idea of good sex is missionary twice a month, he will be glad that you did.<br>  Good luck|`|FzFSzilmaa	oral is spicing it up??? i must be doing things wrong, cos i consider that THE NORM!!! :D<br>  <br>  and the missionary is the standard??? i hate that position... prefer others... ;)<br>  <br>  sounds like you need to take charge... when he's on the couch, updo his pants and start to take things into your own hands, etc... ;)<br>  <br>  i'm 40 and i always make the effort to make things "interesting"... :D|`|PIQeh6kCaa	Dress up hot and sexy and go out to dinner. Then start flirting with other males. Maybe even walk the edge with a little touching, (or more). Come back to your hubby and tell him you're hot and bothered for HIM.<br>  <br>  Tell him you want him, now. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't respond, ask the restaurant if they have a defibrilator to jump start the guy's heart, (and penis).<br>  <br>  Good luck horny 40yr old. I'm available to help if you want? heh heh lol.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	I don't think that "asking" amounts to initiating.  SHOW him what you want to do.  I guarantee it will be a winner.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	You need to talk to him. Maybe he's uncomfortable and just doesn't want to tell you. The biggest problem I see here is that you are explaining how you feel to us, when you should be explaining it to him. It's hard to be so open sometimes, but it's the only way to go. If after you have told him what you need, and want and feel he still refuses to TRY. Then i would suggest counseling.|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	I think you need to try harder than just suggesting, maybe some nice underwear, dressing up? nice meal cooked, music, maybe a strip or buy some sexy toys and show him what you bought, or you could try send him a suggestive text, telling him what you want to do to him when he gets home? I'd make it clear to him that you are in the mood for playtime.|`|xQnkYyocaa	I am right there with you! I brought up the fact that my boyfriend hasn't been affectionate towards me lately and got this response-"You think about sex 24-7." Go get you a toy and please yourself! When he wants some give him a dose of his own medicine. OR, Pull out your toy at night when you go to bed, and see what his reaction is.  GOOD LUCK!!|`|6NgDHZEEaa	Asking isn't really initiating anything. By initiating you should take it upon yourself to get what you want. So why don't you be the go getter instead of waiting for him to make the move.|`|tdulyzXXaa	You can't force someone to desire you sexually.|`|3b352647c1451744c77be95b0723c695aa	Yeah, well, the answer is : initiate lady!<br>  If you're horny AND are not getting it, then waiting and wing hing is not going to get you anywhere apart from hornier!|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	I think just for once maybe you should take charge and you never know it may turn you on even more!! Get some naughty things and surprise him one night!! xxx|`|8a8e5dcc284740df009d2405e628cc0faa	Lol sorry ... i am 40 and horny too lol that is what made me laugh. anyways on the subject i understand your frustration. Maybe he doesn't like "change" maybe his old routine works fine for him.<br>  The other thing is women in their 40's (lucky you hehe) have a sexual peak that requires more sexual encounters while male when they reach 40 (and no It did not phase me hehe) see a lack of interest in sex.<br>  Basically women and men have a different sexual drive as they grow older. women want more, guys ant less (is that EVEN possible)<br>  So i would continue to suggest it and maybe yes, take the lead and instead of asking for it, do it. You know he might not know who to please you since it is new for him and might be afraid to not do it "right". Anyways, try that and see how it works. I d like to get an update on that I am curious to see where it would lead. Good luck.|`|ZvyndFrcaa	I believe you need to discuss this matter with your husband in a very serious way. you are only 40 yr old and you need to enjoy your fullest. Give him the ultimatum.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	Any man who refuses spicing up sex has a serious problem. We are all made the same, although desire may differ, but twice a month is wayyyyyyy below the national average of 2 to 3 times per week. Is ther a possibility he is cheating? Most men are not wired for twice a month|`|07YBD5mJaa	Many marriages get into a rut in the romance or intimacy department but passion doesn't have to be a thing of the past. Spicing things up in the bedroom can also spice things up in your marriage as well. Follow these tips to learn what you can do to excite your partner and probably yourself in the process.<br>  <br>  <br>  1.First, make certain that you and your partner have some alone time together. If this means getting a babysitter or making sure that the kids stay in their own beds, plan your time and make certain that everyone adheres to your schedule. Make the time together intimate time. It doesn't necessarily have to lead to sex but lay on the bed next to each other. Hold hands. Talk to each other.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.Second, schedule dates together. Although spontaneity is exciting, careers and family tend to get in the way. Scheduling a day or two or even three each week to spend a little more quality time with your partner in the bedroom<br>  <br>  3.Third, leave your partner love notes telling him or her what they can expect during your next "date night." Be descriptive and don't be afraid to use a little imagination and share with your partner what you fantasize about. A spicy little note can keep your partner going all day in anticipation of what is to come. Then tell your partner in person when you meet next or on the phone later that day.<br>  <br>  <br>  4.Fourth, try a little role playing. Dress as a nurse or a doctor and ask your partner if it is time for their next checkup. Make certain that they get a lollipop. Some couples like to meet in bars and pretend to pick each other up. Costumes can be found in almost any adult stores and can be used multiple times during intimate moments.<br>  <br>  5.Fifth, be generous. Feel free to guide your partner and tell him or her what makes you feel best. Give as much or even more than you get from your partner. The key to good loving is taking care of your partners needs and making certain that your partner understands what your needs are.<br>  <br>  6.Finally, break the routine. We get so used to our everyday lives that when we fall into routines it is sometimes very hard to break out. Surprise your partner with an afternoon tryst or wake up your partner with a little morning love. A little surprise can go a long way to spicing things up.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -Try a change of scenery. Rent a hotel room for a night, light candles and try massage oils. Even pop in a video and see who gets aroused first.<br>  -Slow things down. We get busy in our everyday lives and spending time with each other does not mean rushing through sex to get it over with. Linger a little and make it last.<br>  -Always complement your partner. Tell him or her how much you appreciate them, how good they look or how good it was. Positivity can ignite passion as well.<br>  -Leave the lights on. Try using a mirror. Take a shower together. -Explore others ways to increase the intimacy level.<br>  -Don't be afraid to try new things in the bedroom. We don't eat the same food everyday so why always stick with the same positions? -Pick a new position and try it out. You may surprise your partner and yourself.<br>  -You need to make sure that your bedroom is a comfortable place. <br>  -Poor lighting and too much clutter can make it hard to concentrate.
yFMy10CEaa	Dude you gotta break this trend early. You cant be wanting to know where you stand with girls all the time. Your 16, so its time to start being a man and just ask her to hang out. Maybe go to your highschools football game or something like that. But you just gotta ask man, thats all you can do. Good luck.|`|Gk2zDhfSaa	A girl flirting around you would mean they would play hit you, sit near you all the time, call you by your full name, you know the obvious. <br>  But if that doesn't help you, here's a helpful website.<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Girl-Likes-You" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Know-if-a-Girl-Li...</a>|`|DUfx1do8aa	depends on what type of girl she is. If she's outgoing you'd have probably figured out that she likes u already so im guessing she is not so forward. The best thing u could do is ask her to hang out and see what happens ...be observant|`|93Pq7zVtaa	Ask her if he wants to hang out with your friends and she could bring her friends along. If she says yes, you are so in there!|`|Or6mIS96aa	Umm... girls like it when you flirt by talking to them ALOT!!! stop at there locker walk up and grab their sides and all that and she likes you if she lets you flirt or if she looks at you alot|`|ITMUqdzOaa	ask what music she's into, and ACTUALLY LISTEN TO HER!!!!!!!!! and ask her questions about herself, but don't go overboard. Just carry on a conversation, and kinda put a little twist on it by flirting, [such as if she asks you a question, respond like "well, cutie..." or something along that line.] if she reacts to that in a bad way, that's probably a good sign she's not intrested....|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	you'll just know if the girl does.
LC3TGSr3aa	I don't think you're overreacting about this. <br>  It would hurt me a lot if I were in this situation. <br>  <br>  You should talk to your dad about it calmly. Maybe he didn't realize he was hurting your feelings or thought that you wouldn't want to be in the picture. <br>  <br>  It's also possible that maybe since you only visit them once in a while they wanted the people that live in the house only. Which still seems rude. <br>  But still, you should talk to your dad before you feel more left out of things and things get harder between you two.|`|RGcXgjEDaa	It is understandable to be hurt and you should talk to your dad about it and just let him know how you feel.  Just be careful when you do talk to him about it so that way it doesn't just seem like your jealous.  Let him know that the picture made you feel like you weren't part of the family, and now that you have a brother you want to make sure your there for him and he knows it.  In years down the road when he is older he is going to look at that picture and ask why you aren't in it.|`|AA12398373	If you are experiencing those emotions, then they are yours, and you have every right to them.<br>  <br>  I think it would be most fair if you calmly told your father about how you feel, and how you wish that he had included you in those pictures, and why.|`|DwFDF0A2aa	I think you should tell your dad that it upset you or you will always feel hurt about it.

Do you live at home with your parents right now?<br>  <br>  If not, or if you do, you should talk to your dad about this and explain to him the way you feel and maybe he can clarify why they did what they did, and hopefully change it and send out other invitations.<br>  <br>  I hope this some what helps you out.  Have a blessed week.|`|R6TFrDtxaa	I can understand why that hurt you. Don't blame your dad. Men just kinda go along with what the wife wants. Why don't you ask them to get a family picture with you in it. I am sure your dad would understand.<br>  It is always hard when people start "second families". You sound like a sweet girl. Just love your brother and let his second wife have time to grow up!!!|`|IF4ugIYraa	yes, you should be concerned.  Don't hide it when they talk about their picture.  Bring it up.  Why ignore it?  That's not a family!  I get what you mean.  So just go up to them now and talk to them about it.  Tell them that there's no reason to do that.  There is absolutely no reason.  Go up to them now.|`|I3RkQz8qaa	It's totally understandable to be hurt. You should talk to your father about it and see if you can possibly do more things actually as a "family". Become involved and let them know that you want to be a part of their lives.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Tell your dad and your step mom how that announcement made you feel.  I bet they were just caught up in the moment and didn't even think how it would affect you.  They need a wake-up call!|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Tell him calmly how you feel about this and tell him you want to be part of the family too. If you dont speak up no one will know how you feel.<br>  <br>  <br>  No you arent over reacting
GpcbuAfmaa	I'm an Aquarius and my boy is a Leo. That match is doomed to failure. Our signs are the polar opposite of each others but we have lasted two years so far and i can't see it ever ending. I don't like his views on certain issues like: I'm a very world orientated person (social worker) and Leo a self orientated person (not selfish but concentrates how things affect him rather than the big picture?) so he refuses to do charity work but I'll be travelling abroad next year to do it. Things like that but you get over them... I don't believe in horoscopes or anything but I have a firm belief in how personality traits are affected by your star sign.

NGz7R9enaa	We can't define who we are by what we wear, how much money we have or what car we drive. If I were you I would have told them thanks, but no thanks towards putting the suit on. You are family and as long as you look reasonably well, there is no need for the fancy dress up. <br>  <br>  Just be you and if they can't accept who you are, then you break the tie. Let them know that you feel a little out of place or that you don't meet their standards. See what they have to say, but don't let them belittle you anymore.

If you consider him a player, you would probably save yourself some drama and heartache by not engaging him or "going out" with him.|`|NhSSl92Kaa	i feel like he IS just using you, but trust me, i kno how it feels to have a guy like you, but i would just be careful|`|fEgK96Rhaa	he's a player. have fun with him, but he will move on, should he fall in LOVE ( HEE HEE) with someone else. so don't cry when he leaves, please.|`|wn2kGTBeaa	he wants in your pants but he gives alot of hints that he likes you i sometimes do this so go for it and it could work out.|`|8QED2yn2aa	maybe he thinks ur fine and all, but then he'll leave ya, when he gets bored ever watch the movie john tucker must die?|`|ItzmYaEDaa	that happened to me before. a guy gave hints that he liked me so much. we sat beside each other in out creative writing class. we spoke with each other over the phone, and there! he said he loved me. i liked him so bad that he ruined my peaceful moments, and he was all that i had in mind. he looked at me all the times. at the lobby, during the class, at the cafeteria... and the world was sure we liked each other so much. it lasted for a month. he just broke up with a girl and he started sending love notes to me, and even wrote a story about us that made the class go crazy in teasing us! i wanted to start a relationship with him, but he said he didn't want any commitment. wtf, he said he just wanted to have mutual relationships and flings. a reliable source told me he had a fling the previous semester and it just ended so soon. my suspicions were correct, he was just flirting. yet i know he liked me, yes, since he told me he did. but that was just all. some people love liking without having commitments at all. here's my advice: ask him straight to the point what he thinks of you as somebody he can be with for a long time. If he says he'd love to be with you, then that's it. continue having sweet moments with him until he kneels in front of you to ask for your hand. but if he says "i don't know", then just don't expect anything would happen in the future. It's best not to expect, so that if ever nothing will happen between you and him, you won't regret being bothered that much. who knows, he'll change his "player" habits. one good note: i met my husband through flirting and i thought it was just like that. he was a player, and i was his 4th girlfriend. it was surprising when he asked me the sweetest question: "will you marry me?" so bottomline: just balance everything. never appear head over heels on this guy. don't expect too much. stay cool. something might or might not happen. just enjoy his presence. and make yourself open to another guy. he'd get jealous and fight for your love. im a psych grad anyway and i know how guys think. they don't like girls who are too obvious. they want spice of hints coz it challenges them. and they want popular girls, so make sure you have other guys who like you. (coz this is what i did with my husband... lolz).|`|POkOfMSSaa	Hmm, thats tough. And im pretty sure its happened to everyone. <br>  A player that flirts, and youre not sure if they like you.<br>  <br>  All you can do at the moment is wait and see what else he does.<br>  What if you tell him you like him, and hes like "oh, I dont like you like that. and I dont really flirt with you." <br>  Because that might be how is personailty just is, and hes probably like that with girls he feels comfortable around.<br>  <br>  If he really likes you, he will make is defintely obvious.|`|X3hfas5Taa	Your story is very interesting...I feel like I was reading about myself when I was a little bit younger.  I honestly would not bother relationship wise with this guy!  Flirt all you want, flirting is safe and fun but I would not take it to the next level.  By they way you described him and this story, it sounds like to me that he gets what he wants, gets satisfied and then moves on.  If he really is a player, and you're at that age, he might be wanting sex or something else related.  If you do decide to go with this guys, please be careful and make sure you talk to him and really get to know him before you take it further.  Don't get your hopes up if he's not the right guy for you.  Don't let him use you though, make sure you are strong and don't back down on anything you are not comfrontable doing.  Hope this helps!|`|dhrfbfrOaa	Ooh! Sounds like he might like you! Sometimes guys can do things like this just to flirt or lead girls on though, so be careful not to get hurt!  Judging by the way he is acting ( i can't know for sure) he probably does like you but has a girlfriend right now. I would play it safe and just pay attention to what he does and lay low until he breaks up with her, you don't want to get in the middle of a realationship break up! It can get ugly. Anyway hope this helps!|`|tBaUZvaLaa	he is a player, and jerk. He is flirting with you right now and enjoying every minute of it. My advice to you is to stay away from teens like that because he is nothing but heart-breakers. I am sure if you take your time and look around you will find a more suitable boy for you.<br>  good luck.
7YN1MhYRaa	Next time he tries to disrespect your body, you can tell him, " Listen Fu*cktard, my body is not your amusement park, do not touch me!" and if he continues kick him in the balls. grab his hair and yell it in his ears! <br>  <br>  And if your boyfriend won't stand up and defend your honor from some skunk that's groping you, he's not the type of guy you should have. <br>  <br>  Jock or no jock, that's illegal! he can't touch you however he likes. Sexual harassment, tell the principal, dean whoever if he doesn't stop.<br>  <br>  It's not cool.|`|ze4Gt1araa	I'll say put a restriction order on him and when ever he tries to slap your butt or try to kiss you kick him in the balls. Do it as many times as you need to. Eventually, he's gonna stop and leave you alone after he sees how aggressive you could be.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|AdoY6wKZaa	You already told him in so many words to stop, and he hasn't.  The jerk might have done that to other girls. Someone of authority should tell him to stop. Report him to a counselor or someone in the school office. Or tell your parents.|`|zfKzLFgxaa	',:) you can actually get a restraining order. cuz that's sexual harrassment|`|QUFAKk1paa	your boyfriend is a pansy if hes not handling this himself|`|lvBXds5Baa	if i were your bf i'd be doing something about it myself. that's disrespectful...<br>  slap him next time he does it.|`|6TuFqVBEaa	you should leave you boyfriend cause hes a ***** for not kicking his ***|`|zXpbfBcuaa	giv him a slap across da face n tell him to GIT DA F*** AWAY U F***IN A**HOLE|`|8fEeyNMeaa	Your an idiot for letting him do that. Yes your letting him do that. Buy a can of mase and spray his *** in front of everyone. Guess what guys think your a slut for letting him and will try it next. If not tell your dad or and older cousin he need his *** kicked. Your man must be smaller than the perve right. Nothing a louieville bat won't fix.|`|ilx6DeVYaa	well for one, your boyfriend should be handling it himself and telling the guy to back the **** off, but if he won't, girl just slap the pig across the face and yell the you told him to stop harassing you.|`|ljQV36z3aa	That is sexual harassment. Explain to your boyfriend calmly that you do not ask for these things to happen. Report it to your principal or a teacher and tell your boyfriend that you reported it.|`|BxXI9AHcaa	You "expect" that?  Really?  Sad.<br>  Your boyfriend is a puss, by the way.|`|RkzzBKxwaa	booty booty booty booty rockin everywhereee xP|`|lOGHxtoUaa	tell ur boyfriend to take care of the guy.|`|DuP69zNYaa	yo you betta tell a principle parent teacher or dean|`|4X7b0s5daa	you could sue him i think and keep your distance away from him|`|6xiwiiIzaa	Jock should get a sock from your Boyfriend, if he thought anything of you, or a sharpe knee in the ,B--lls from you ok,|`|DLvHWOo7aa	It's already passed sexual harassment and battery.<br>  <br>  tell a teacher, parent or principal|`|K8OjmMUAaa	First, I don't care what sort of stereotype this guy is. He doesn't have the right to touch you anywhere...and no, you should NOT expect it! Next time he tries to touch you, push him away hard and YELL at him - and I mean YELL, so everyone in the hallway looks - "STOP TOUCHING ME!" <br>  <br>  Also, go to your school guidance counselor and tell her/him what this guy is doing, and that you've repeatedly told him in no uncertain terms to stop, but he won't. Make them protect you, if you can't defend yourself from this guy, and your boyfriend won't scare him off for you. <br>  <br>  If your boyfriend is getting mad at YOU, I think you should consider getting a new boyfriend. Why the heck isn't he telling the guy to shove off?|`|APNB4OfIaa	Its already gone too far.  Talk to a teacher, adviser, school cop, anybody.  Just because hes a "jock" doesn't make it right.  Its assault, battery, & sexual harassment|`|lSgBe5bMaa	i say kick him in the nuts. hopefully that will give him the hint!|`|PxMNxytjaa	tell him to get the h word away from you!!!
2vBYTCUDaa	were they shiny? Guys like shiny things. Seriously though, he probably likes you. You were flirting with him and he was flirting back. Just keep talking to him and he will eventually ask you out.|`|yyvcryrbaa	he wanted some stickers.|`|mLU3DkTKaa	it means that if you play your cards right you just might find out that guys love girls that dont mind if they act their shoesize and not their age , especially when they are only doing it because it feels so damn good to have a girl that likes you for you by his side .|`|ptvtGqKgaa	He likes you but he's too shy to say it. Don't exactly ask him if he likes you. It would make him even more nervous. Try to find out without exactly "asking him".|`|xX7EnZsdaa	Maybe in a weird way he was trying to flirt with you.<br>  <br>  If you want to know if he likes you just ask him.|`|VMoDsdREaa	play i kissed a girl by katie perry it may attract more attention.|`|2sgYribSaa	He was flirting may possibly dig you. Be blunt and ask him about it
ifwkYl8Qaa	maybe, shes thinking about it.
62NmYVHMaa	you can turn gay at any time you get people who used to be married to women turning gay. look i am actually being serious here look at some girls see if you find them attractive if you dont then u r gay if u find both men and women attractive then u could be a bi-sexual|`|AnImYu4Haa	Well its not like you reach a certain age and say wow I'm gay. How old are you anyway? The teenage years are the most confusing when it comes to sexual orientation. If you're attracted to him, you could be gay, but it could also be a phase. And if you are gay, its not a big deal!|`|c290b7856214fd8baaebf9e77a554dffaa	I guess you are a guy and are wondering why you find some sort of attraction to this boy. It is fairly common for people your age to experience these feelings for another of the same sex, but does not mean you are gay.<br>  <br>  You will experience all sorts of feelings at your age - you may even experiment with another boy. Eventually you most likely will also find girls as attractive, and experiment with them.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day your preference will become clear to you, but don't worry at the moment, just go with the flow.|`|9WSYMAG7aa	DUDE <br>  <br>  okay PEOPLE ARE STUPID;<br>  <br>  you arent GAY or NOT GAY<br>  <br>  you make a decision; its not like its pre-integrated in your psychology. <br>  <br>  and I would say you want to be gay.|`|dShhCo8yaa	I would say wait until you are in your early 20's (21 sounds good) to decide on your sexuality. <br>  <br>  Loads of teenage boys go through a phase where they think they are gay.|`|ob3WOb5saa	You can think another guy is fit but that doesn't mean you're gay.  Same thing for girls thinking other girls are pretty.|`|BIFO1Vudaa	uh, there's not really an age, but you should be able to have sex or make out with people of both sexes to figure out which you enjoy if not both
YW74O9aNaa	I'd make her shape more realistic... like an average girl. And make her hair brown and short haircut :)|`|a6f8IoISaa	i'd make her fat cause no barbie dolls are fat|`|dwLqreuvaa	A mirror.<br>  <br>  Thats my barbie doll, because girls should love themselves and not follow after something plastic. Let them see who they really are. :)<br>  <br>  Even though barbies were one of my favourite toys when i was a little kid.|`|YRTYXfggaa	The term "Barbie" refers to perfection.  It's not about a doll anymore!  It's a standard.  To think of changing such a thing is opening up a can of worms!  At 50 years old, the girls hot!  I wouldn't change a thing! ;)|`|AA11502346	I'd change her hair color to a medium brown, change her eye color to "blue" and give her a set of glasses to wear.  Now she looks like me, except the fact that I'm plus-size.|`|Krs6O0T7aa	wat the heck?<br>  well my design wud b a regular barbie doll.<br>  then her shirt wud say "i suck" <br>  th end|`|SoR6DQvRaa	Idk the same but look like me? haha j/k never really though bout it
dFHsAXDMaa	okay I am going to tell you as a mother  who has been divorced and has remarried you are over reacting.... when you chose to leave the children's father or he chose to leave and you let him. You knew this would be an issue eventually.... he was not going to remain single and neither will you. The man you date will not be taking daddy's place and the women will never take your place. she is just being nice to her BF or new husbands children. would you rather she treated them like crap come on grow up sorry....<br>  <br>  what you can not do is make your children the information highway... by this I mean asking them when they comes home from being with him say on the weekend.... so what is daddy doing.... did you meet his girlfriend did she sleep there... what does she look like? ... this will absolutely destroy your kids. And as they gets older it will not be him they resents but you, for making them feel like informants......it is unfair to them enjoy them when you have them and when you have free time enjoy that too doing things you enjoy. like hanging out with friends without having to pay for a sitter.... dating....a hobby. <br>  <br>  You need to stop thinking of him as your man or your ex lover/husband and move on for the best interest of your children.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|mbvpWNMeaa	It depends on what exactly she is doing, but in she oversteps her bounds, you have to stand up to her and tell her when to mind her own business.|`|JUEkTETAaa	u have to keep in mind that if she will be in the kids life that u want to know that she is good with them  and will not let anything happen to them when they are not around u ...u do not have to like her but u can respect her|`|LJDiSCCNaa	so glad I dont' have this problem. <br>  <br>  Just be happy she wants to be loving to them and not a hurtful b!Tc}-{
Uj5kuzoJaa	There is no way we will ever be able to tell unless we find someone who has real boobs and a real penis. Other than that it is just a guess on what is more painful. Some women's boobs are a lot more sensitive than others so it might be comparable to getting sacked in the nuts, but whose to say? I personally think that it's worse for guys to get hit in the nuts than for me to get punched in the boob. Good question lol|`|JCVs8W6raa	NONE just in MO VIES!|`|XTj0LP6gaa	Getting hit in the breast is painful especially if you have nipple rings, but it's still not as bad as getting kicked in the nuts from what I've seen.  I've been hit by a speeding racket ball and all it caused me to do was curse really loud.|`|u0eTvggDaa	none, i am sure she was just making that up to make them feel bad for hitting her in the boob.<br>  <br>  but it really does hurt, i don't think it's as painful as for guys, but it's not pleasant.|`|uiQGzWLFaa	When they're developing, they're really painful, but if she was crying for 5 minutes, then she was probably looking for attention or cannot deal with any pain what-so-ever. They don't hurt that much.|`|BIFO1Vudaa	i know somebody who has both<br>  it claims the testis are way more painful
pjggSVKKaa	hey man!!<br>  in my humble opinion i think go for it if you love her then give it a try because if you don't you will always regret it.<br>  <br>  if things go **** ways then you can just deal with it! <br>  <br>  if ye were good friends before then no matter what happens ye should remain friends|`|oJORZebKaa	There's only one thing you can do..Make sure you do new things so she won't go bored, ask what she likes in a guy. Try changing and being different every week or so. Test it out.|`|rAt4wdMyaa	it probably will. dont get with<br>  her, just stay friends... ive been<br>  there done that... she says this today<br>  but will change her mind tomorrow *|`|56n8oUvjaa	if she goes from guy to guy...its a cycle she will not break...don't ruin the friendship... Just because you love someone doesn't mean being in a relationship with them would work. she has issues is all I know. To not love herself enough and be single...she lacks confidence and valuing herself more than just passing herself around|`|773a0ef61688dd825e941d816e68d310aa	Dude, she's pregnant.|`|gNFPy6S0aa	It sounds like she'll probably let you stick it in her butt at least once.  Definitely worth a shot.|`|c2uywBsIaa	I don't think it will because you were friends first..|`|HO9RGUx9aa	if she rely loves you she would stay with you in bad or good times like you were their when she needed someone to help her and been their in her bad time if you love her don't let her go show her how much love u have for and that u care also|`|2SzLx5Knaa	nope.<br>  you don't want to risk that good of a relationship,<br>  also, it doesn't sound like she is that great of a girl to go out with...<br>  be honest.|`|TKIkkZFTaa	thats why friends arent lovers because when you brake up or if you brake up you might not go back to the gd friends you used to be but try and keep the relationship exciting so she won,t get boared|`|DCofdauLaa	if she really loves you, she won't dump you.|`|M5oDWsLPaa	IF U DONT LIKE HER THEN TELL HER IF U R NOT SHAW THEN TELL HER THAT U 2 NEED TO TAKE TIME|`|JUEkTETAaa	then u all need to see what will happen... some relationships start out as friends and grow from there
509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	"let" her?  it sounds like yours and give it to someone.  first of all, he is not yours.  second of all, when did he say he likes any of you?  you must be very young.  it is not up to you, it is up to him.  maybe he likes one of you, maybe he doesn't like any of you.  make it clear to your best friend that you like him, you can talk to him about your feeling.|`|67fc0c30125bac036c6df15bb7b4e5c3aa	Hey im in this same exact position... just make him like you and not her.  Give him some texts or IMs and start getting to know eachother.  The guy that me and my friend both like is finallly starting to like me over her and paying more attention to me.  Trust me just show him your great qualities and flirt alot and show that you care about him.  I know its hard cause of your bestfriend and all and i think that my friend is kinda annoyed but shes not saying anything but oh welll cause you cant just let her have everything while your unhappy and get nothing... Hope everything works out :)|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	Go for it.  Who cares what she thinks?  It's not like she thinks twice about how you will feel, when she wins the prize.|`|62cdabc33de92fc0cab4f5016db9f9bcaa	its what inside that counts, looks are not everything... getting old is hip cause were all doing it . and i bet you cute, no one thinks there ever good looking.|`|Q2G3LHzUaa	be a friend to him..yea become his friend and then something more could bloom from that or u could just b friends, which is still cool!!! ^__^|`|cc0faa60937826078df9839152605c82aa	go for it!!!!! dont second guess your heart|`|ItzmYaEDaa	you can talk to your bestfriend in such a way that it won't appear as though you are competing with her. i had 2 friends who liked the same guy. one of my friends (girl#1) was not pretty, and the other(girl#2) has a great sex appeal. Girl#1 talked to the other in a not-so-nice way, and told her, "please dont make a move." Girl#2 got offended for appearing as though she was a flirt, and so waht she did was do something secretly -- sent love letters to the guy and having him talk to her over the phone. Stuff like that. It was too late when girt#1 learned about that, and she was so disappointed and humiated. They were not in speaking terms right now. I suggest what you do is tell your bestfriend that you really like the guy. Ask her what she thinks of you making a move. If she says it's all right, i'll support you, then you're definitely safe. if she gives  you hints that she doesn't want you to do  it since she has plans on doing so, then don't do anything. After all, she is your bestfriend. You can afford to lose the guy, but not her.|`|b6BvjNrKaa	Obviously you are beautiful in your own way al you have to do is find out what you have in common with the guy you like and fin out before your friend finds out then if he likes you back nicely tell your friend he likes you too hopefully she'll understand if she doesn't maybe she's not an actual friend.|`|evqLlglFaa	Let her have him and next time you and her like the same guy go for it because shell probably have a smaller chance than you will.|`|HjXTkHK5aa	You should try to find out who the guy likes the most.And remember it dosent matter about the outside, you might still have a chance if to him your personality counts more than looks.|`|3V6QxYA9aa	be supportive but if she was talking to him first then let it go <br>  dont start a fight bout it<br>  <br>  <br>  your truely<br>  jennie|`|XjkdUliGaa	talk to her and see if she'll b ok if u go for this guy and more than likely she'll b supportive if not honestly shes not ur friend|`|dfbc3f35da98132143b605b02d89e5b9aa	threesome. that solves it all. haha|`|iy75lge3aa	Be submissive, suck a dick|`|Zqby1cXpaa	hey just talk to her an tell her you like her an see what she does and also remember all is fair in love an war
nCWjdyddaa	I'll tell you what you do: You get on the side of that child. You kiss up to your sister and Mom. In that way, not only can you see what is going on, but you can blunt the impact on the child by intervening when necessary. When your Dad goes to court to get custody, you'll be in a position to help make that happen.<br>  <br>  I know this seems duplicitous. But, remember, you are not MAKING them do anything wrong. If your sister doesn't use drugs and neglect her child, there will be nothing for you to report. And, if she does, then you need to testify in court in order to see that the child is out of that mess.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.
K8OjmMUAaa	Well first, please change your attitude regarding her being "out of order". If she came from a terrible family and had been living on the streets, she missed out on having any sort of normal childhood. Then she got married before she could even sort things out for herself. Maybe she really does love you, but she's only 20 years old. She may be legally an adult, but she never really even got to be a teenager properly. Don't expect her to be completely matured, even though she's had the baby. Look into getting her a good therapist; she probably needs to talk to someone. It sounds like she's had a really hard life, and I'm sorry but sometimes getting married to your "hero" and having a child isn't enough to "fix" all the hurt from the past. She needs help...not to be treated like a wayward child. <br>  <br>  When women have babies, their sex drive can go waaayyy down in no time. Especially with all the other stuff she probably has on her mind; obviously, she's feeling the need to go out and unwind with her friends by using alcohol and drugs as an escape. Yes...she definetely needs some help.<br>  <br>  About that tattoo....that's her choice. And getting her name on you was yours. If it's bothering you so much, get it covered up with something else.|`|4Pa8TnLeaa	yea she is being out of line <br>  it sounds like she is rebelling to the relationship.<br>  <br>  with the going out thing....ask her to tell you where she is going etc so you know she is safe and then promise you wont restrict her or make comments when she does tell you. <br>  just talk...there is obviously something bothering her.. i hope it works out!|`|Hzf3QK9faa	I believe she has gotten married and had a child at a young age. I believe she wants some time of her own now more than ever because she has work, a baby and a marriage and wants some space and needs of her own met. Why is she just doing this going out, without calling and letting you know? That's where I see a major problem because she should be able to have some time to be trusted on her own but do it responsibly and call and let her two responsibilities be covered, you and your baby. Drug use is another kettle of fish as well, it's not a great example for a Mom to set for a child. But she isn't talking this over with you, not even calling to try and let you know. Are you stonewalling her when she has tried? Does she know how you'll react from other situations  so much that she isn't bothering to put herself through the hassle of an argument she doesn't want to have?<br>  Or is she postpartum depressed and behaving out of character as a way to try to self-medicate that problem? Either way it's time to be open-minded and talk heart-to-heart and work something out as adults and get help if needed.|`|WFFXHFfVaa	She is out of order yea for treating you the way she is, but I think , shes only young, and as probably settled down far to early, shes now just doing what normal teenager people do, going out getting drunk and having a good time, and cos shes only young,and your older, she prob sees this as you nagging at her. You need to both have a chat, and find out what she wants, and whether she is really happy with her life. Good Luck and hope it all works out|`|gYWDrHVFaa	She was too young when you got married and you were a father figure for her.  She is living out her youth, which she missed out on bc she was married too young.|`|G6Uy43coaa	I think you should have married someone you own age that you had something in common with.  You were worlds apart five years ago and still are.|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	I think she wants to be single again.|`|AA11706291	To much to young.|`|IFd94XDkaa	Not wanting the tattoo isn't out of line IMO anyway but the going out with friends all the time and not coming back when she says she will, and especially coming back really drunk isn't good at all.  <br>  <br>  My guess is that all the responsibility of being a wife and mother is overwhelming her and freaking her out.  She's trying to escape it by going out with her friends to pretend she's single and childless.  I've seen girls do it before and it's not good at all, not for her, you or the baby.  It doesn't sound like she had much of a childhood and she's still very immature.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest that she find an interest or two outside the home that she can go do once or twice a week.  She might need some space now and then but going out till really late and getting drunk is just asking for trouble, big trouble.  <br>  <br>  Going out with friends is ok but going to bars, partying, staying out till all hours isn't and you aren't be controlling to say so.  No married person, man or woman, is going to be ok with their spouse going out like that all the time.  Once in awhile, maybe but not very often.  I bet she wouldn't be very happy if the tables were turned.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|LVlS4y7Caa	I think you weren't in your right mind taking up with a girl young enough to be your daughter...and now that her youth is taking off and finding how "un-hot" it is to be married to an older guy?  -She sowing some pretty wild oats and then some...One wonders if she can be a "fit" parent at this stage...<br>  <br>  I doubt you can rein her in, I really do.  She simply isn't mature or even CLOSE to where you're at - at this time in life as a 40 year old guy.  Face it.  You goofed.  Goodluck salvaging this relationship...you're gonna need it...<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grace|`|OR8hrr0aaa	Both of you grow up lol sorry but you are sulking because she wont permanently scorn your name into HER BODY and won't have sex with you.<br>  <br>  She is blatantly tyring to enjoy her youth, did you not think that would happen she is tyring to live the young carefree life that she actually doesn't have whereas you are at the stage where you expect her to be as mature as you-not happening.<br>  As for her! sickenning, taking drugs and getting hammered while she has a baby to look after. <br>  This is why people should wait!!|`|e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	ok here we go, <br>  you married someone a lot younger than yourself a teenager in fact, now she is going through the i married too young phase and wanting to party and have the single life and your old enough to be settled down in front of the telly as youve done it all already.<br>  Sometimes women do go off sex after having a baby, i just think youve entered into a marriage here and as an adult you should of seen the problems that you could be facing marrying someone so young, so talk to your wife take her out for a meal make her feel special, you say she says that she doesnt want to speak to you because your jealous and controlling, the idea of the tattoos make me see you as the teenager here, and yes this is controlling, its her body if you wanted to get your body tattooed with her name then thats your decision, and if she wants that, then thats hers, but shes not being out of order by not doing so thats her choice,shes not your teenage daughter shes your wife.<br>  If you say shes had a troubled past, then you being the controlling husband isnt going to make matters any easier, did she leave home before, as you could be going to go down that road again and youve got a baby here, and as the more adult of the 2 you need to sort this out.<br>  In my opinion shes staying out more as she feels uncomfortable at home, as shes said your jealous and controlling, jealousy can occur in relationships with the age difference you have, you need to trust her, and not smother her, shes young and still needs her friends and to enjoy life,you said shes had a bad past so she needs to be treated with kid gloves really and you should of realised what you could of been taking on  in this realationship.<br>  Take her out, give her a little space with her friends, and look after that child together the baby doesnt need a drunken mother or an agumentative family to be brought up in, otherwise your daughter or son will be repeating history here.<br>  Think about it be a caring husband and a loving father youve got some hard work to do.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	So she doesn't want a tattoo. That makes her a bad person? Just because she doesn't want to look like a hell's angels b*tch doesn't mean she is out of line. You think because she is 20 years younger, you could control her. Ha ha, did you call that one wrong. You go girl.|`|goY0JHzlaa	What do I think? I think you, an adult male, at the age of 36, hooked up with an underage girl. Yes, you gave her a place to stay.

It sounds like you think she owes you for you helping her. Give her her life back you don't own her.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Wow you made a bad choice. She was way too young to get married and she really only wanted you so she could have a place to live. You may as well give it up she wants to hang out and be a kid now.|`|NGKwsawdaa	You're an adult and she's still a kid who missed out on her childhood, now she is rebelling againest you and just wants to have fun.|`|850419267f537526b260221ba44cc84faa	I think she's growing up. You dated her when she was really young. At that age girls don't know what they really want. She just wants to hang out with people her own age. She's not being out of line. She's acting her age.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	This is what happens when grown men marry children! ugh!|`|qyMc5yOFaa	ur 40 shes 20 <br>  <br>  <br>  shes still young and trying new things <br>  <br>  try giveing her presnts ans cooking her dinner and help out whit lil thing try spend time together as a family|`|AA10199949	No, she's growing up and you knew that day was coming.

Sounds to me like she just used you for the time that she was homeless and since she has complete control of her life now, she doesn't need your help, therefore she doesn't need you in her life. <br>  I would just pretend like I didn't even care and let her go out and party and see if she cares that you seem like you don't care (if that makes any sense at all). Then you'll know if she even cares at all about you or if she's just using you.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|ASJlcmTgaa	I honistly think as she is 20 and been homeless etc she feels as though she has missed out.  I think she needs to get the 'clubbing' stage out of her system and she will end up not going out so much.  We all go though it and it does seem to be around that age.  <br>  <br>  It is natural for women to go off sex when they have had a child.  I wouldnt pressure her as she will defently come to you when she is ready.  <br>  <br>  I know you are concerned for her, especially with the drugs thing but I dont think that she will ruin what she has got.  She has too much to loose.  In terms of the tattoo it sure takes guts to have a name out on but I dont think there is anything wrong with not wanting your name on her.  She shows she is committed with you as you have been together so long and have a child.  <br>  <br>  Be patent, chin up, its just a rough stage.  Things will perk up, as much as it is hard dont pressure her as it will only push her the other direction.|`|R1vvH4aKaa	You sound like decent guy! However when people tend to be good, they tend to be altruistic. You got involved with the wrong person. She does not value your deeds, she does not appreciate your deeds, she is acting out of her own selfishness. <br>  <br>  She just want to have an easy life without any sacrifices. Now it seems that she got tired from you and wants a new guy close to her age and you out of her life. <br>  <br>  You did a wrong choice, now you will pay for it!<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  People might not like what I said. However, in life when you get into trouble never look for someone else to blame. If you analyze every single instance in your life, you will find out where you made a mistake!|`|d162f121edc74fbff5dcd0d3373d75e6aa	She's still kinda young and she's had a baby so there have been a lot of changes physically and mentally. It is not unusual to go off sex for a while after having a baby. She should be able to go out now and again, but it's not very caring not to let you know she's not coming home when expected....is the baby normally with you when she does this?<br>  Do you think you have been jealous or controlling?<br>  I wouldn't force the tattoo issue.|`|egpVC6uMaa	She is acting her age..you married her before she even knew what she wanted. Now, she is feeling trapped and wants to do the things she never got the chance to do..<br>  <br>  Yes it's irresponsible of her to stay out all night as a wife and mother, but this is what most people do at that age. That is one of the risk that you took when you married someone that young...<br>  <br>  As for the tattoo, I don't see anything wrong with her not getting a tattoo of your name. It's her body and she can do with it as she pleased and your marriage doesn't sound stable enough to last forever...a tattoo isn't something that you can remove overnight, once you have it on your body. What if the two of you were to separate? then she would have to walk around for the rest of her life, with her ex's name stamped on her.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|cuF0pL2taa	if you went up to her and asked her if she wanted a divorce, Im sure she would say yes. She's to young. She did everything to young. She wants to live her life now.

You were way too much older than her, and she was in dire straits.<br>  <br>  I really don't anticipate that your marriage will last. She's a kid, even more so because of her difficult start.<br>  <br>  The whole tattoo thing sounds creepy, immature on your part, and jealous and controlling.
KSUksBZkaa	you should sit down with him and tell him how you feel. let him know that you are leaving the decision totally up to him so that he won't think you are trying to control him, but remind him to plz keep your feelings on the subject in mind. maybe he could be extra careful when he is at the club where girls are concerned. just don't be around them. i mean, he atleast owes you THAT much out of respect for you at the very least. In my opinion, if two ppl are engaged, they shouldn't EVER be in a compromising position w/ the opposite sex other than their fiance, even if it is just dancing. You shouldn't take that and run with it though, because there is a difference in being around other women and being in a compromising position. Whatever you do, don't try to control everything he does. It will make it worse. Although, as his fiance you SHOULD have a bit of a say as to who he spends his time with TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. When you talk to him about this,don't go on the defense or get upset right away, just explain your feelings calmly and rationally. Who knows, he might end up deciding to spend his birthday with you instead.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Sounds like you have trust issues. You better talk now before everything blows up. It's his birthday, if he wants to go out with the guys, he should be able to. I would have no problem with my fiance going out with the guys on his birthday... I just don't see what the problem is. But maybe if the question had a bit more punctuation it would have made more sense.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FnskUYpqaa	Me and my fiance have an agreement wherever he goes I go and vice versa. We also love being together 24 7. Why would your fiance want to hang out with his friends on his birthday and not you? Why can't you all hang out together? Like my fiance says if you are doing something that you wouldn't do infront of your significant other then it's cheating.|`|db67c0941f0845d64edf1a84aa913e6aaa	let the man go.  You have to learn to trust or what you both have is nothing.  Grab a group of your girls and ya'll head out too.|`|MKZHeJk2aa	Let him go and have fun with his friends.  If he loves you, he'll be good and all will be well.  A marriage should be based on trust.|`|R6TFrDtxaa	your fiance should spend his b-day with you. Not out partying with the boys.

I'm sure it's all the rage when you're spotted buying a pregnancy test at the grocery store too.  F them.  Live your life & let your fiance have a party.  And MOVE as soon as possible.|`|nqINitkmaa	I think that if you really don't trust me that much then maybe you should hold off on marriage until you can work through your issues. I think he should invite you to come, and that he should want to spend his birthday with you, I do agree with you on that. But if your worried that everytime he goes out there is a chance of him being unfaithful, you have much deeper problems than this birthday thing.|`|3SSVBJAqaa	There is no room in a marriage for jealousy. Let him go have fun with his friends.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	He's your fiance and you don't trust him?  That's sad.  Let him go have fun.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	Let him go out and have fun.  It's his birthday.  Just remember that if you hear a story it's been twisted so many times it's not what really happened.(you just said so yourself).<br>  You have to trust him to do the right thing.  You say you trust him, but if you really trusted him 100% you wouldn't be asking this question.<br>  <br>  btw, you can't be with him 24/7(as someone else has said) you guys need your own separate lives and your own separate friends. Otherwise you'll get sick of each other. Trust me, it's all "oh i can't go anywhere with out him" for the first few years and then it gets less and less like that.  If you are still in that phase then you shouldn't get married yet.  Your still in a honeymoon phase and not a real life relationship.

Du8MYqwDaa	Well it obviously seems like you're freaked out about it and not ready for the whole "love" thing. If I were you, I would just tell him that you're not in that point of your life where you want "love". If you want to break up with him, then just tell him that you're afraid of commitment. It's not like he can do anything about it, and it won't make you seem like a bad person or anything.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|ESQzBFOraa	tell him that you're engaged  to a service man in Iraq, and are saving yourself for him.|`|FmhUZLgoaa	You have to be honest with him if you don't want to be in a relationship with him then tell him before he gets to attached.|`|9QYAW437aa	umm,<br>  the best way is to pull him aside and just tell him.<br>  be like "i don't think it's working out, and i think it's best if we stay friends."<br>  if you say that bit about being friends, make sure you mean it.<br>  also, i reallly don't like how people going around saying that they "love" other people.<br>  it annoys me.<br>  so....<br>  GOOD LUCK!

I have seen way too many relationships drag on just because one of them was too afraid to break up with the other. One of my friends actually stayed with a guy for a year because she felt guilty for leaving him, even though their relationship had fizzled a while back and she knew that he wasn't "the one" for about half their relationship. You're doing him a favour by telling him early, rather than waiting that long and then saying "I actually wanted to do this a long time ago". Then the person receiving it would think about all the wasted effort they put into the relationship during that time and it would hurt more. I've also been on the receiving end of that and... yeah, not cool.|`|Xc8dd6t4aa	Tell him the truth.  Sit him down, tell him why you are breaking up with him.  Don't do it in a public place.  Don't be brutal or make excuses.  Don't use cliche lines such as "It's not you, it's me", "I don't deserve you", etc.  Just be upfront- even if he "loves" you, I am sure in the long run he will be happy that you broke up with him instead of stringing him along.|`|AA10147673	All you have to do is simply tell him in a nice way that you don't like him any more and you want to break up with him because you just can't be his girlfriend anymore.<br>  :) (Good luck!)|`|ZgMARJvdaa	listen lil pimpin if he's getting old wats the point of wating just go up to him and say dude you got to go period sorryand if he cries and goes on his knees tell him see you later sucker|`|YpPUHw8Saa	tell him its over

And how or what makes him say that his girlfrend may leave him? What is she leaving him for? For all you know he is a player that likes to play games. If you value yourself and have dignity  leave him - You said he talks about them having sex all the time right- that could mean that he is saying that you have to have sex with him or make having sex with him better- he doesn't want you for you...And also what makes you think if she leaves him he'll want to be with you for a while even when or if he move in with you- he may just turn around and get another girl that he wanted to be with and have sex alot with- THINK about it- I may give you this advice but its still up to you to follow it- just don't end up posting another question about how he said he loves you yet he's cheating on you at the same time and your wondering if you should leave him or not.|`|YbnEr1z7aa	he is a user, i cant tell you no, but at least talk with him tell him it's wrong.... and yes that's cheating.... extremely!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|4HoVVCenaa	Trust your instincts, not your heart.

OBwqjS8maa	Ugh! You know, I can be shy at times too and it really makes me angry when people say stuff like "you need to talk more." I don't know about you, but that makes me want to do the exact opposite. <br>  <br>  If they're talking about a situation where you weren't involved, listen and see if it reminds you of something you all did together and change the subject. <br>  <br>  I don't know...people telling me I need to talk more just makes me want to walk away! lol|`|d85c9f54c1789376bcbba63672563679aa	Sure you can join in. If they talk abt party u didn't know, u can ask them how was the party? what's interesting? are the guys charming in the party? blah, blah, blah.... You can even ask them to invite you along in the next party.<br>  <br>  it's abt how initiative you can be. When u started the topic, try not to stop & continue. Sometime, i even talk crap with my friends. It makes the whole conversation more relaxing & fun.<br>  <br>  And a Good Tip for you. Always remember to smile more when u meet ur friends.|`|IsRk5ZoVaa	be outgoing! :)<br>  its hard but just let go.<br>  ask questions.! i think quiet people are wierd. i think they have something too hide.<br>  your friends arent gonna make fun of you for talking.!<br>  just try to make conversations with them you know.<br>  :]]|`|BXd4I9mmaa	Just say, "That's what she said "|`|jeMNcPPYaa	When I was young I was the same. It wasn't that I was shy, just that I didn't have anything to say, I am quite incapable of bull, so if I didn't know what they are talking about and it wasn't appropriate to ask. I said nothing.<br>  <br>  But what one of the others said is absolutely right. You should ask. let them know you don't know the person, if they are gossiping about someone then you actually improve the conversation for them and they will fill in big gaps while all you have to do is listen (or pretend to listen if you are like me and not only can not talk bull but can not listen to it either).<br>  <br>  I lost loads of mates and potential mates through honesty, I just couldn't help myself, if I believed they were making stuff up I would tell them.<br>  <br>  This isn't a good thing unless you are fairly chunky (ok, I admit, lumpy rather than chunky), and anyway it doesn't cost the likes of us to listen even if in our head we are wondering why people make things up.<br>  <br>  Because you I suspect are like me, not in looks (I hope for your sake) but in the fact that we are too real. That is where your quietness comes from, you are not shy, you are real. But do what I learnt to do, listen and make nonespecific comments. Play with it sometimes, let them dig holes and bury themselves never knowing that you are the only person who noticed. <br>  <br>  Life can be a laugh, but sometimes you have to hold it in till you get back home, bury your head in a pillow and laugh at the stupidity around you.|`|rffdGwB9aa	Ha! You're just like me :D<br>  <br>  Anyways: Yeah, ask questions. If you say something like "What is________?", then they will have to tell you!<br>  <br>  **If it's a party you aren't invited to, you probably shouldn't try to drag people down or anything by saying "Oh my goodness that person probably hates me." People can get very judgemental and start talking about how all you do is complain or something.|`|VjgIeIMgaa	lol easy one. ask questions about it. act curious even if u'r not. u learn more that way. thats wat i do and i fit in almost anywhere.|`|AA12148387	Talk about something you do know about it.|`|99teIRU7aa	say o i heard about that but i dont really understand care to elaborate?|`|eCKNRcIVaa	Ask questions

K8OjmMUAaa	Well first, don't feel unsexy or un-needed. It's not like that at all. Guys don't watch porn because of the "beautiful" women, and they don't watch it because they need to, and they don't watch it because their girlfriends aren't enough for them. They watch it because they are visual creatures and they like visual stimulation. It's got nothing to do with WHO they are looking at when they watch it. Believe me, they aren't thinking "OMG she's so gorgeous, I think I could fall in love with her, I wonder what she's like?" They're thinking..."Boobs. Butt." Or something else similar and unintelligble, lol<br>  <br>  It's their primitive brains that like it, in other words...not their hearts!<br>  <br>  It sounds like he's trying to get you into it, and maybe he wants you to see first-hand that it's not about needing to look at other women. You could always go to a p0rn shop with him and see if you can find some "classy" stuff that you might like a little better than hardcore stuff. There is a LOT of different stuff out there. You could agree to watching something with him, as long as you get to pick it out, and if you don't like it, you stop. <br>  <br>  I say give it a shot, see if you can find something you like.|`|81wvN8Rraa	I would only really be worried if he could only have sex with you after watching porn or if he was spending hours on end watching porn. I mean if the only reason he is lying about watching it is because you told him not to then it's not a big deal but if he is going over board then I would worry;|`|AA11969451	You need to work on your self esteem issues.|`|fQYU96euaa	Porn has that effect on normal women, as do the hollywood types...they have had plastic surgeries to get big lips, boobs and basically a body that is not theirs and we as mere mortal women are now having to compete with those images, cause lets face it 95% of women do not look like those women in porn. The media has crammed these images down our throats and now thats the standard most feel they have to be to be considered attractive....which is very sad.<br>  Now, I am not against all porn, I am just saying its normal for women to feel like we dont measure up when we see how turned on our men get from that crap.|`|jKDZlgMiaa	No, this is not okay.<br>  <br>  Every person is allowed to have boundaries and should have boundaries. He is not respecting yours. <br>  <br>  If it makes you uncomfortable to do something sexual, he is EXPECTED to respect that. This could be a huge red flag and an indicator of how you'll be treated after you're married.|`|SIK58haraa	I feel the same way. It hurts my feeling that mu husband watches other women and get turned on by them. To me it's like he is saying he wishes he could have sex with other women. I don't watch other men get naked so why so he watch naked women.|`|ebd01f2a9ac954de0f1feb8fb05fc0c7aa	Its just porn gosh. It never hurt anyone and its not because you aren't providing his sexual appetite. Just guys are horny......all the time.|`|goY0JHzlaa	This is obviously causing problems in your relationship. If he doesn't respect what your feelings are towards this issue, then, it's time to move on.|`|th7C1aoaaa	He's going to be looking at divorce before you know it. Porn is okay. It's not about you being sexy.|`|1epjqrflaa	Yes, your making a big deal out of nothing. Watching a porn together every once in awhile can be fun for both of you! Guys watch porn, hell I do too! There is nothing wrong with watching the act of sex, when it starts to interfere with your sex lives, or it becomes to frequent, then you have a reason to address it. Until then, stop nagging him about it, your not his mom and you cant tell a person they CANT watch something, he is a grown man.|`|kbz5S3waaa	see my husband watches it in "secracy" and I've tried to get him to watch it with me and he won't. I would like to share that with him.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Let me see here, it makes you feel uncomfortable and he lies about it. You're not off to a good start.<br>  <br>  Not 'all' guys watch it, some of us respect our wifes enough not to.
6edczUEBaa	You are over reacting. My husband and I watch porn together all the time and it gets both of us turned on. We have our own movies we made but we like to mix it up now and then. Hell we have more porn then we do regular movie dvd's. Trust me he does not think you are not sexy just because he wants to watch porn. He is right when he said he is a man and all men watch porn. Have fun with it and at least try watching 1 porn with him to see how you like it. It can make your sex life better and you both can learn more tricks of the trade lol. I think if you try it you will like it.|`|CYcqQb6Caa	i think that you should tell him that it makes you feel uncomfortable to watch it. even though you made one of your own that doesn't matter its different. I had this problem before an i told him that i hated it and if he didnt chnage i would leave. And now he doesnt do it anymore. but you should give him some credit for telling you the truth in the end. hope this helps|`|HVcga9UGaa	all guys watch porn at one point in time and if they don't they are lying..<br>  now my GF knows i watch porn  and she doesn't care but i dont think i would watch it with her i think  it is a little disrespectful and i would never make her watch it ..unless she wanted to<br>  but no i dont think your overreacting i think he needs to think about your feelings first|`|u5XEf5Wwaa	watch soft core porn. im sure there is somthing that you like to do that he doesnt, maybe not. i would just tell him end of story if you really dont want to do it. i would doubt that he wants to watch it because of the beuty of the girls. sometimes its just the vidual stimulation.|`|cuF0pL2taa	Just do it. If you can make one of your own, whats the big deal? Its on tv. Guarantee you will be turned on by it. Please the man!|`|th7C1aoaaa	Yes read the answer I put on this same question, in married.|`|Dwdbv9LLaa	I've gone through this exact same thing. I don't think it's a big deal out of nothing, it's a very reasonable concern. <br>  <br>  My boyfriend stopped watching it on the grounds that I...ahem...provide some for him. Maybe you should give that a try.<br>  <br>  And uh...that technicality thing? That's BS. I'd call him out on that.|`|ZAjlZEXAaa	If you are in a serious relationship, then try it at least one time.<br>  If it doesn't work then you'll be fixed.<br>  Warn him that this might not please you, and might not make you want try it again, he has to understand that.<br>  <br>  You have to mutually understand each other.<br>  This isn't a one way relationship.<br>  He needs comfort, he isn't confident enough in himself in bed.<br>  You guys need to talk about his current issues (family? work?) something is obviously bothering him, preventing him to fully recenter himself in your relationship.<br>  He must be saying a lot of weird things to you e.g. It's fun, let's do it, we're not old yet, and so forth. He might not sound serious saying it, I know.<br>  He has to look in your eyes when he makes love to you.|`|LPEWAoWCaa	Watching with him isn't a big deal, you should give it a try. Now if he's sneaking behind your back and watching it that's a big deal!|`|8SKpsVG7aa	yes your over reacting why would he marry you if he didn't think you were sexy|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	Well it depends how he thinks of porn.  If he'd rather watch porn than be with you, then yes it's a problem.  But it's common for guys to want to watch porn with their girls to show them things they've seen in them that they want to try or whatever.|`|blOfX1nhaa	Hey I felt the same way with my man when we first started our relationship becos I would think he was looking at other girls and getting turned on by them but Its not even like that, but seriously you get over it and its only porn your the only girl for him|`|3goALQ2Paa	Pornography is sin.|`|GExKoh1Gaa	just do it!
blOfX1nhaa	ok who cares your grandmother is old and nobodyz gona change her mind or the way she thinks so just forget about it and let her be a christian why dont u just go and buy some christian books and tell her u believe in god atleast to make her happy ****!|`|iD4ejChZaa	Yet one more post that tries to bring down true Christianity in people's minds, remember this; there is 2 sides to every story and we only read one side.  Your father is a grown man and could have all the friends he wanted if he chose to be sociable, we make our own choices in life. I have no relatives in this big state i live but i went out and made friends, regardless of how my relatives are. btw--Jesus is the way, the truth and the life.
1ac39fcfa274ce08e7a2111bc679183aaa	When we first got married I found tapes i the house that he had before we were married. They went in the trash. We talked about how I felt about porno.  (it is cheating, a desire for what is not yours. not to mention that it is nasty to want  to watch other people have sex)  <br>  <br>  What ! he also beats his meat ,oh no not the patty whacker! He needs to stop!|`|81wvN8Rraa	Nope porn is a problem if he is no longer interested in you. But if your sex life has remained the same then it's no big deal.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Watch it with him Girl!<br>  My husband and I watch it together and it gets us both turned on and we recreate some scenes or positions we saw in the movie - very hot!|`|BxXI9AHcaa	Pleasure each other!  Geez!|`|P9wE9XZlaa	I agree with veni....another problem is you dont express your new feeling to him why not do that..<br>  he thinks its still okay for him to be watching.and once you put this in his mind then he should slowly reduse the porn.....|`|iD4ejChZaa	of course it's offensive to me, i'm not a slut why would i approve of sluts?<br>    its extremely degrading and immoral.

I don't like for people to mess with my tummy, and it's even worse now that I am 7 months pregnant. However, it's a lot more common than you would think it is.<br>  <br>  I sometimes wonder if guys like to mess with your bellybutton because it is just another orifice that they can penetrate...lol.|`|mLU3DkTKaa	a clean belly button is almost as fun as a dirty bellybutton . just dont let him retrieve anything from there and put it in his mouth , that just isnt right in any world .|`|7437a3cdb4e7f01087cec9c9c42fcb58aa	Yes, definitely weird, any guys want to touch my belly button, will lose a finger or two.|`|n1MZefbqaa	Maybe he likes the smell of it. That's weird.|`|xmWBzvNSaa	my bf too. he says it's sexy and always turns him on. haha. i guess some guys are like that.|`|2hXteNxOaa	I play with my girlfriends belly button to flirt with her. MAybe he is doing it to flirt with you.|`|xX7EnZsdaa	I don't like belly buttons exactly... but i sometimes do stuff like rub my face on girls tummies...<br>  <br>  You probably think that's weird  :)|`|D5sqQ0HCaa	Yep, my boyfriend does that...its just cute is all.|`|mFGw6zoCaa	yeah mine did that too lol!
Jucak0HLaa	I had an older brother.I saw him like ever day,and we were 11 years apart.He was awesome and I miss him more than words can say.|`|rK1nSum8aa	I have an older brother. I don't know why we are close. I think its because are personalities are the same and we've gone through similar challenges in life and he is very supportive. We see each other  every other month.
cdQryr7paa	Wow, your pretty healthy if you were just out 2 days ago jogging and saw your teenage BF with 3 other girls, like one of  your other questions say.<br>  So go for it grandma, get married and die happy having sex.<br>  <br>  <br>  Everyone check out this person's questions on her profile before you answer this.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Way  too  old. <br>  <br>  You  need  to  turn  up  your  oxygen,  dear.|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Yeah.<br>  Right.<br>  Surrreeeeee you are...<br>  <br>  Any one who reaches the age of 92 ought to be able to do what they please...<br>  <br>  Grace|`|cJooDZpnaa	It's fine if you're not already married but dont have kids|`|iD4ejChZaa	yeah but dont have kids right away|`|NGKwsawdaa	in all honestly, who wants to marry a 92 year old woman?|`|pA6Ntl2Eaa	Honey I don't think you are 92.  I think you are either confused or bored you just asked the following question a few days ago.<br>  <br>  Is my boyfriend cheating on me?<br>  i was out jogging today and i saw my boyfriend with 3 other girls! we just got back together today and idk what is up with him? is it puberty or just him cheating and if it is cheating, WHY !<br>  <br>  Common Puberty you are not talking about puberty at 92!|`|5HoZ3NHeaa	I say go for it, you were jogging two days ago, if you can do that then you can survive marraige.|`|WA8feS8taa	I don't even think this question is funny, people actually use this board for real problems and you're just ruining it.|`|Gv71dW0oaa	la la la|`|QIqPwcH6aa	bored much? or just boring?
2eoAqicdaa	Why??? he loves you NOT his staff!!<br>  you know he can get in trouble for that lol <br>  <br>  My fiancés a DJ and sees hot woman all the time but their all just up their own ar**'s! seriously!! <br>  He has no interest in them at all! I was curious so i went to a couple of his gigs and honestly... I think I can trust him enough not too do anything lol I was the same as you at the beggining and now I dont even know why I was being insecure..<br>  He gets alot older drunk woman who try to flirt with him and I think its really funny coz i know he's mine :)<br>  I sort of take it as a compliment in a way now <br>  Go with him whilst he's interviewing his staff then you will find out the real reason why... <br>  he wants to have his own bar/restaurant, fair play to him! <br>  I wish I had all that! You 2 may end up very rich or have the best place in town :)<br>  <br>  You have nothing to worry about, honestly! x|`|cdQryr7paa	Wow, talk about insecure.<br>  That's what your worried about?<br>  I guess I don't get it.<br>  A man that has the guts enough to risk starting his own business and be his own boss sounds like an ambitious go getter to me.<br>  If you are willing to leave him because he will hire hot waitresses, then maybe you should, because you obviously have some trust issues.<br>  Especially if your biggest concern about the relationship is how many months you invested.<br>  I'm sorry, but you sound kind of selfish.<br>  This man is obviously ambitious, and you don't want him to be for your own selfish fears.<br>  Sorry, I don't mean to offend, but that's what I see.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	No, you should get involved and help him.<br>  <br>  The #1 cause of all divorces related to entrepreneurship are when the spouse has an interest in the business but is not involved.  If you didn't care then it wouldn't matter, but if you are paying attention to what he's doing and you have some interest, you should ask to get involved.|`|AA10197672	The fact that you are very insecure about this means that you do not trust your husband 100%. I dont blame you, there is a chance that he might, I'd feel the same way as you do. Its a tough call since you dont know what he will do. I'd say wait, dont leave. It might be totally different than what you expected. He might  not even do waht you think he will. What do you have to loose if you wait few more months, its good to figure out find out than just leave nad never know what will happen. By the way are you married? or just dating? if just dating and you know tha tyou can live your life w,o him then id say leave him. But if married then you have to give it some time...|`|asxqampCaa	That's "lose interest" - not "loose interest." My god.<br>  <br>  And positioning yourself in the relationship by gauging time and when to dump him? How f*cked up is that?<br>  <br>  Just go the hell away and stop wasting his time playing all these juvenile insecurity games.<br>  <br>  By the way in this economy there's no way in hell a new restaurant will make it past 18 months.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Wow, you sound really insecure!  You need to go see a therapist and work on building back your confidence.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	Well if you're this insecure, you might as well leave now.  Something else will happen anyway to bother you.  He'll be walking behind someone on the street or pull up next to someone at a light and look over at them or answer the phone when a female telemarketer calls.  All kinds of things are gonna happen that are gonna make you jealous so you may as well get it over with now when it's easier.|`|AA10240683	If you do not want to be hurt do not get involved with someone. You base your fear on a two month relationship with a guy, projecting worry about hot looking waitresses. Did you overlook hot looking customers? If you are insecure now, when these things may or may not materialize, then do not get involved.|`|iZbgUtxcaa	You should be considering the fact that the economy is going downhill and less people are going out to eat and drink and staying home.  He clearly does not have a head for business.<br>  <br>  But since you are seriously immature, you focus on the lamest aspect.|`|QIqPwcH6aa	to worry about the fact that there may or may not come a time where you might actually have to worry, is just a waste of time. You don't know if that will really happen. Do you really think he is that shallow?|`|1YdeUn1Caa	Just tell him, it's a bad idea financially. Especially with the smoking bans. He won't make as much. Not until they lift the bans.|`|AA10199949	Start hitting the gym because there is always going to competition.|`|goY0JHzlaa	You really need to go talk with someone about your insecurities. There's definately a problem here.|`|NGKwsawdaa	Wow talk about being insecure|`|HVvkCs7baa	Wow...you should leave him now not because of him but because of you. You cant be happy with anyone until your happy with yourself and it clearly dont sound like your happy with yourself to think that he'll just leave you over random women. There's always going to be someone that you feel looks better than you and someone your more attractive than but that's why it cant be all about looks if you think that's the only reason he's with you then you guys wont last anyway. Also if it's because of something that happened with you guys before than your not ready to be back with him you haven't gotten over the past yet. You should be happy he wants to start his own thing thats really good. You should be supporting him, helping him, and not thinking about him leaving you for some young hot looking chick. The relationship in itself sounds very immature. You wont be with anyone if thats how you feel. Young, hot looking women are everywhere, you dont need your own store to find them. Also relationship, you take risk, you get hurt it comes with the territory. My husband and I been married since 9 Jan 09 and he hurt me on occasions, he hurt me alot before "I do" but (thank you God) we got through it because I loved him enough (vice versa) to work through it but we love each other to death. <br>  <br>  You cant be insecure and be with someone because you'll tear down the relationship a person cant satisfy someone who is insecure because insecurity comes from within and what they do would never be enough to satisfy you.|`|17V8mXFdaa	are you married? well if you leave him then he will end up with one of them and have an excuse to why he did it because you left him and probably be hurt anyway... if theres no trust then why are you with him or maybe you should give him a chance to show you you can trust him... try it!|`|LAx5rfm4aa	no work it out|`|eSx065Jhaa	From between lines I can see that you will be hurt . do not bluff  ur self ...IF ...     u want 2 stay keep ur far look on the possiplities expected ...
MvisyrRVaa	Jeez 23 and 21 and still living with mommy. Either you need to cut the cord. Or if thats not the case then tell them to get the hell out and learn how to live on their own. Lazy Slackers!|`|M5oMYc9Laa	Yes.  You are the cause of part of the problem because he knows you will keep doing.  What you need to do first is get him some counseling.. make sure he has no mental issues so once you know he doesn't have any physical ones.  When you are satisfied that he is in good mental health... <br>  <br>  STOP.  Giving, paying, helping, enabling.  Kick him OUT!  What would have happened to him had the cancer taken you.  You could live 30, 40, 50 more years but when you are gone then what?  Force him to grow up and remove your stress.|`|6ErVPePEaa	He is never going to learn if you continue to let him get away with it. Show him some tough love.. People never learn until they hit rock bottom. Kick him out. Tell him to go live with his girlfriend. You need to stick to it otherwise he will continue to walk all over you|`|KaZTg0Plaa	sounds like someone needs a good dose of  "get out if you think you can do better".  make house rules--pay and stay.  don't let the more responsible kid always taking up the slack for the screw-up.  not fair and you're doing neither of them a favor.|`|Ot2tJXU2aa	I felt your pain!  and the only way he will learn is to let him live on his own so tell him he can live with you as long as he is paying his share of the bills.  No money no room! Oh and thats advance payment for room and board he has no credit with you any more. I mean Really! your responsible son must be counting the days until he can afford to live on his own and not have to pick up the slack for his brother, not to mention you too! What won't kill him will make him stronger. By the way he's playing his own mother and cancer survivor, shameful and congrats on the remission and all my best wishes for remission years ahead of you too! ;-)|`|s7seaaPkaa	i used to be the same way <br>  my mom and dad just let me know i had 3 weeks to get a job or get out.<br>  they said they would only help me if i wanted to help myself.<br>  which is very true.<br>  let him realize that you are no longer respondsible for him he's 21!!<br>  i now have a government job and im able to move out and take of my self it feels better to live on your own he'll see when he does.<br>  {{i was 16 then and now im 19}}<br>  so i learned young.
3Dhacs6caa	no shes horrible to have as a friend. dont let her ruin ur reputation. she wont have many friends when she grows up. just slowly stop talking to her, calling, texting, etc. and hang out with the new friends u made. & if ur tired of her, and dont feel comfortable hanging around her then dont. this girl is not a "best friend"<br>  <br>  hope i helped(:|`|qZ0310yVaa	you do not need friends like that tell her she is rude and to leave you alone her day will come|`|IsRk5ZoVaa	im excatly like your friend or ex friend,<br>  as long as she isnt mean too you or doesnt make you or force you too do something you dont want to or have anything to do with.<br>  i think you should be her friend,<br>  cuz it sounds like she never did anything bad too you,<br>  talk to her about it and let her know your here for her cuz it sounds like shes having issuse with guys and other things.<br>  maybe someones mean to her at home,<br>  but thats no excuse too not be someones friend.!<br>  but um dont even trip about stuff like this.<br>  its their life and let them live it how they want.|`|CvkuzcpDaa	you shouldnt be someones friend because you feel you have to...! <br>  i would talk to her....explain how greatful you are to her being your friend when u just arrived, but you feel like your friendship isnt going very well....you feel like your complete opposites...and its time to move on...you dont have to be mean to her....just explain your situation...good luck!! xx:O)|`|AA11599430	you can stay friends just don't talk to her as much as you are used to|`|Ivwxm3Mwaa	Maybe you should set her straight.If that don't sound good, you should be with your other friends.
KTqdwG3Xaa	Well why do you find the need to even ask this guy out if he does a drive by kiss. How kiddy is that?|`|yyvcryrbaa	say do you wanna go out with me to the movies tonite?
65ojSBXgaa	They want you to ask them out. Girls are always expecting a guy to ask because that what they expect. So go get them tiger!! Remember be confident and smile. Much luck -Gail|`|KxMzBFR2aa	maybe they just want to flirt and have fun|`|OBwqjS8maa	Ask them out and find out. Sounds to me like they like you. <br>  <br>  One at a time, of course. lol
IfOTZhQyaa	Your question should not be how to LOOK happy when you are miserable inside. You need to heal what ever is causing your affliction. Talking to people you confide in can help because often they will be able to see in you what you can not see for yourself. Low self-esteem is a big problem for many people. You need to know that it's ok to love who you are. You don't need to measure up to any body's expectation but your own. When you understand that who you are is what makes you interesting to other people especially if your not like what you would call normal. Why?  Can you imagine if everybody thought the same and acted the same. Being different is what causes other people to seek each other out. When you like yourself you won't have to act happy and believe me when I say that people will accept you as you are. People try to hard to fit in with a certain group because they think that will help them be popular but, what they don't understand is that what makes them popular is not the group of people rather their confidence. You do not need to change who you are for anybody. If you do the people you meet will be around a person who really does not exist. It's like living a lie. Have you ever heard "I thought I knew you" well it's because you changed into someone your not. Be yourself and act, loud, weird, stupid, funny, corny and allow yourself to get angry. It's ok! It's YOU!|`|b6ZMOPdQaa	just BE happy!<br>  Have in your head a funny song/movie/etc. Smiling, make jokes and have fun!|`|wa3AvezGaa	Smile|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Think good thoughts.|`|Hek7MUNYaa	smile<br>  talk like nothing is wrong<br>  try to look confident <br>  <br>  Confident is what makes a person happy, sexy, and yeah|`|eCi4UsCAaa	To Look happy around others even if one's not elated* just try to think about things that would be you laugh, crack a smile. Or do like i do.<br>  If you have moved away from somewhere you love or someone you love,just think about the good times you shared there or with that person|`|N8RKcVGoaa	to really be happy what  really makes you happy|`|IwTnhhJ7aa	if you laugh real loud and smile and are cheerful noone will no, act like a clown if you must try to bring others out of their doom and gloom<br>  <br>  then wghen u go home at night you break down|`|GExKoh1Gaa	drink redbull
5s3uFazlaa	Yeah, she can make you mad...but it's just a pen!  You can't possible say that you hate your sister because she thinks you stole her pen.  Since you said she is younger than you, she is probably just trying to get on your nerves.  When you make a big deal about something small to your parents, it makes you seem immature and always causing trouble. Instead, just deal with her and realize that you, too, did similar antics when you were younger.  Your parents probably let you get off easy too because you were so young.  Focus on bigger things, like school, and not your little sister, who is trying to  get a rouse out of you.|`|prjXvpL8aa	I understand how that could irretate you and i never hate my sister, but she does get on my nerves. I think that you might be making too big of a deal of this though|`|JUEkTETAaa	yes|`|3lXZzK5caa	yes i do hate them sometimes...i have 4 sisters but our arguments are what keep us close|`|xdq8i59Uaa	i dont hate my sis.. but.. like i know how it feels like.. you like feel like killing ur siblings. but u do love 'em but hate them at the same time!|`|NC7xG1njaa	It's a pen|`|KHmaVsA1aa	yea|`|HsWkA8jQaa	yes i know how you feel<br>  but trust me brothers are WAY more annoying then that|`|8DhmRwMraa	bros r even more anoyin !!!
090262824b3fd3b7d4ddf902b6aee070aa	So get off your butt and start asking neighbors for sitting job,  Or yard clean up, man it's not rocket science....
RXI8ImdIaa	Only you can answer this for yourself. Schizophrenia is a big deal, a relationship with this guy is not going to be a 'normal' type of fairy tale story. If you stick with it, you have to be in for the bad as well as the good. It will be a lot of work and patience.|`|YDlfu6AUaa	My ex-husbands father had that problem and made his wife miserable to the point she either wanted to kill him or kill herself just to end the misery he caused her.<br>  He was awfully abusive to his two sons and would do things like say "Your a son of a b****" over and over to himself then turn on one of his family members and attack them.<br>  He did that to me once, I walked into the kitchen and saw him standing at the counter repeating "Your a son of a *****" and he turned to me and said "What did you call me?!!!" and I said "I didn't call you anything your crazy and that's why your not aware you were saying that about yourself."<br>  He chased me out of the house into my car where he ripped the antenna off my car then stood in front of the car beating it with the antenna and screaming like a crazed lunatic.<br>  I backed out to leave but he jumped back in front of the car while banging on the hood and beating it with the broken antenna and I finally thought "Ok, I'll just run his *** over" and I put the car into gear and punched it but he jumped out of the way before I turned him into roadkill.<br>  But that was normal behavior for him I was just sick of it and so I divorced my husband (happiest day of my life) and I haven't had to see his crazy father since.<br>  My ex-husband had the same problem which didn't surprise me because his father probably made him that way so if you don't mind a lifetime of misery and possibly having children who are abused and made into crazy lunatics by their dad then go right ahead and keep talking to this guy and eventually marry him and live the rest of your life in a living hell.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	You shouldn't stay with someone because you feel guilty about leaving. If you genuinely do not get along most of the time and his bad episodes are scary and bad then you should not stick around and try to "fix" him or wait for him to fix himself. If it were me I would probably move on and look for a healthy relationship instead of one that sucked my energy.|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	You're the only person who can decide if your feelings for him are strong enough to stay with him through all of this. If I were you I would try to stay with him, but ultimately it may just not work out because of his persecutions. All you can really do is try though. Good luck.|`|JshtWS94aa	Honey, run as fast as you can,it might save your life.He will be sick the rest of his life even if a med comes out it might not help because some days he might forget to take ,or he just wont take it.Most schizopherenic are like that SO ..RUN <br>  .|`|NDEDBvcSaa	If it is worth it 2 you.....this is a little scary to me, but if you can handle it then go for it!|`|ubbKS6BBaa	Depends on how severe his case is. They have medications to make them more "normal" these days. I wouldn't wait for him but if he comes around and takes the right meds, it's up to you. <br>  <br>  It's very difficult living with a schizophrenic. If I was you I would keep in touch with how he's doing and do some research on the web for his type of case. Find out how severe it is.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear that. Hope things work out for the both of you and his family.|`|mnXFU41Raa	Only  you can answer this...<br>  Do you love him so much that you do not want to live without him?<br>  Do you have the urge to see other people?<br>  Do you want to just be friends or stay with him and wait for the cure (which could take a long time)?|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	I think that this is very weird, and maybe you should not wait for him.|`|64oOqELCaa	yes i would|`|bQR2Ld7Eaa	My dear, "i'm just waiting for some kind of med to come out, or that he has a change in his meds or up his dosages." Doesn't grantee that nothing will happen again. This is a LIFE kind of thing, it NEVER changes, it never goes away, and he will never be better.<br>  <br>  You have to realize that medication, doesn't REALLY work... it only works for a little while, then the person builds up a tolerance and they go through EVERYTHING AGAIN.<br>  <br>  You leaving him, WHEN HE NEEDS YOU THE MOST, isn't a good sign. Because you left, I don't think you're ready for this relationship, so you should break up with him.<br>  <br>  You also have to realize, that him at his WORST will always come back. If you can't deal now, you can't deal in the future, and that means you can't be together, because marriage is for life!<br>  <br>  Plus, if you married him and had kids... THEY HAVE A MORE THAN 75% CHANCE OF GETTING THE SAME DESEASE TOO! IF YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND NOW, HOW WILL YOU DEAL WITH HIM AND MAYBE KIDS WITH IT TOO?
eCi4UsCAaa	Wow. Thats the first thing i can say.<br>  So if she acts like a ***** in front of you then question that first?<br>  If she broke up with you becasue you werent ready to get married then that may be a problem.<br>  If someone loves you or likes you enough, they'll understand how you really feel. No one waits forever, but some people do.|`|YZMdV5Wdaa	She likes you, you like her.<br>  Tell her you miss her and you want to get back together.<br>  Duh! :)

While your mom has a right to do certain things with her fiance, these things are still upsetting.  Tell her how you feel, and tell her that you'd appreciate it if she made sure that she did these things in a more private place.  After all, you respect your step-dad, but that doesn't mean that you have to know every little thing that happens.<br>    But don't make her think you're accusing her when you talk to her about what happened, because then she'll get angry, and the conversation will NOT end well.  Make sure you're doing this in a calm manner, meaning you might want to vent to someone first to get it all out of your system.|`|LC3TGSr3aa	Well, along with the fact that your mom has to respect your feelings you have to understand that it's her life. <br>  You may be in her life but you can't control it. She has the right to do whatever she wants. <br>  <br>  You can talk to her and tell her that you feel uncomfortable when they do this stuff while your around but you have to realize that you can't demand that they not do it. She has her rights.|`|IARYnu6zaa	You have to learn to respect the fact that she wants to be with someone else besides your dad, even if it isn't the easiest thing to do.<br>  But your mom needs to understand that this isn't easy for you either.<br>  I don't think you should be angry, or act like nothings happened, I think you should talk to her about it and say you would rather they were a bit more subtle as it does upset you.<br>  Goodluck honey|`|sTZQWiGlaa	Hmmm.... that's okay to be sad if you still don't know him. Tell her tomorrow. Call your dad if you want. He's still always going to be your dad. Your stepdad is no one to your real dad. Tell your mom tommorow.

Don't make it harsh, or rude, don't seem mad, or it's going to make her get defensive. Try to tell her that it hurt you, and ask her if they are going to do stuff like that to do it while you aren't home or around. Try to make her understand that it DID hurt you, and that she should care more about how you feel, than her sexual pleasures. *but don't say that, lol that would be like upsetting to hear her 12 year old say that. <br>  I hope i've helped you <br>  :)<br>  and I hope everything goes well.<br>  <br>  -chelsea|`|AA10832514	My mom did the same thing, too. It was difficult for me.  I was 13 when she started to live with my step dad (they weren't married yet).  They got married a few months later.  I heard them a few times...it was gross!  I'm 47, and its still gross to think about!<br>  <br>  You just have to get used to it, sweetie.  Sex is a natural part of life.  Just ignore them.  Believe me, when you get older, you wont want your Mom asking you about your sex life!  <br>  <br>  Its part of growing up.|`|ubbKS6BBaa	Stay calm and tell her that what you heard was not for 12 yo ears. And tell her that it bothers you that they're doing that when you're in the house and you're not used to him yet. <br>  <br>  It's not fair to you...and would gross me out personally. But if you stay calm, it makes you sound mature. If she acts like a jerk, then sure, break out the crying but don't scream. Just go to your room.|`|prjXvpL8aa	well i understand why you would be mad. if you are really mad, you should talk to your mom very seriously about this. I would try to get closer to your step dad. Adults do that stuff.... grossly.... So I would keep acting like normal until you talk to your mom and after act like normal... Otherwise it will be extremly awkward|`|NQ2sZku0aa	well it is actually very normal for a soon to be married couple to do that but i know that it may be hard for you to accept that because of your age so you might wanna talk to your mom about that and not only that but also about your feelings toward this situation aswell|`|rffdGwB9aa	I wouldn't do anything.. it doesn't mean it's the right thing, but, she is an adult, so she has freedom to do... things. However, at the same time, if you have an open relationship, you should probably just tell her how you feel about it.|`|scwaket4aa	you should just tell her how you feel....<br>  exactly, and then see what she does....then you would see whats the most important to her...<br>  tell her at least wait til no one is around you know?<br>  im sorry for you|`|mMLci6LSaa	You need to get over it.

But I would expect the anger and understand your disappointment. But your mom has a right to be happy, right? Your dad would be doing the same thing. But the fact that this happened during the day (I am guessing) and that she was loud, it is wrong. You should tell her, but let her know that you are upset not because she was with another guy, but because she was so public with something that you should not have to see or hear at this age. Tell her that that is what worries you. Try to talk to her as a friend and daughter.  I hope everything works out fine.|`|TfcxT0zTaa	Sit down talk to your mom and if this happens again get rid of him lolz|`|vqoQW11baa	This is going to be hard for you and your mother, and even your soon-to-be step father will understand this.<br>  <br>  You are used to the idea of your mother being with your father, who is quite a distance away. You are going to have to talk to your mother about feeling uncomfortable but at the same time, you can't demand she stop doing things in the bathroom or bedroom with her soon to be husband.<br>  <br>  If you talk to her she will be more careful so as not to make you aware of these situations or do anything which will make you uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Like I said though, don't make a scene and be rude to your soon-to-be step father because this will only make things worse.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|W0633l18aa	just tell her that it made you feel uncomfortable and upset and your still getting adjusted to the idea of them being to gether - she'll act gentler and be more careful in future and you'll feel better for getting it off your chest<br>  <br>  everytime something like this happens try doing something to get ur mind of it or calling a friend or your dad so you feel comfortable and iwth your dad you'll feel safer <br>  <br>  finally try and get to know ur moms bf better, just talking to him, askigng what he does, what his hobbies are to help you become more adjusted and used to him, maybe go out bonding <br>  <br>  ur reaction is really normal and understandable so dont feel guilty for crying, tell your mum how you feel becoz its clearly gettign you down and its an issue that needs to be addressed <br>  <br>  gd luck|`|bfCll0q0aa	You should talk to you mom, without your future step-dad around, and tell her how you feel. If you feel like they're moving too quickly and you're uncomfortable, let her know ;; she's your mother and will understand. A 12-year-old should never have to hear two people going at it.<br>  <br>  Don't get angry around your mom/step-dad, otherwise you will appear juvenile. Try to be very calm and collected when you talk with your mom. Let her know what you really think/feel.<br>  <br>  If worse come to worse, and things between them don't slow down and you still don't feel comfortable, you may want to consider living with your dad for a while. However, I can't imagine that a mother would choose her husband-to-be over her own child.
OCMSTxYfaa	Absolutely...you have to let her experience things in life, even if you worry about her. It doesn't matter how old they get, you will always worry.  Have her check in with you and make sure you can get a hold of her if necessary.She is at a reasonable age for this trip, so let her enjoy her spring break!|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	if she is responsable   thats like if i let my child go to  the beach here  id so let her if her grades were good and allow her to have some fun as a child  she will love you totaly for it if she brakes your trust alot then i would say no and if she makes it home on her time and have her call every two hours or so  to check in i would so let her do it|`|8ZmjIYORaa	Um, I would go with them, but split up when they shop.

Some moments call for kissing. Like at the movies, at a dance while slow dancing, sitting on a park bench. Anyway you just have to go for it. Grab her hand and see what happens. Lean in and try to kiss her. You just have to do it to know. Females like for guys to make the first move|`|Yv6pa3QAaa	if you dont know when to kiss her than it doesnt seem too natural.. it should be natural and let it happen|`|ynLWX4s1aa	Be spontanious! If shes your gf obviously she wants to hold ur hand...|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	12 hrs|`|MgMsMExPaa	A lot of this depends on the level of emotional attraction that you feel for her. Kissing is a sign of emotional endearment so it should be used in situations when your emoitions are heightened. Say that you are alone with her and you are saying goodnight then a kiss ont he cheek is approiate. If you fell a deep connection to her and are the type to feel that you  two are best friends then a kiss ont he lips is appriate . French kissing is generally used in passionate situations where necking or peting is involved again this all depends on the depth of the relationship and where the two of you are at regarding your true feelings. It is important that both of you are comfortable with all of this. As for as hand holding generally this is a more symbolic demonstrastion of attachment to each other, this also depends on how you both feel about public displays of affection and and how confortable you are with each other. I would say that you at your age would be okay with kissing on the lips and holding hands as long as this dose not offend her or others that may see it. In the context of being alone some french kissing and necking would be fine if she is up for it. She will know if you really mean it or not when you are kissing her especially french kissing. One other thing  about french kissing is that it may lead to sex. If you get to the point of comfort with this then you need to have some condoms on hand just in case. Know how to use them correctly when the time comes. You do not want to end the relationship by having a baby while you are still in school.|`|uxy4k4uYaa	A girl will usually never reject holding hands with you, *especially* when she's dating you! She's with you for a reason, you know? If you want to hold her hand, then do so. Because, all along she might want to hold your hand but be too nervous. Sometimes that's how it works.<br>  <br>  A kiss.. you'll just know. There will be this appearance in her eyes telling you that she wants to kiss you. This, of course usually happens *after* you start holding hands and all. You'll know when a girl *doesn't* want to hold your hand if she tries changing the subject when you talk about the two of you, or when she turns her head if you lean in, or even if she just doesn't look like she's in the "kissing" mood.<br>  <br>  No worries! You'll know. "When the moment is right" *does* exist, and it's when you're comfortable. You know how guys have to initiate these things ;)|`|V2ZKTMOJaa	hold her hand on the first date, if you are walking or something and you stop talking, hold her hand, maybe massage it with your thumb, she will think it is sweet, dont kiss on the first date, at least i dont think you should, and if you do, kiss her on the cheek when you take her home, or get really close, like just about kiss her, were talking touching foreheads and noses here, and then either say goodnight (u should prolly eat a mint) or see if she kisses u|`|vvVrbB4Daa	your gf wants to hold hands when she looks at you for a long time, or when you see tht her hands are cold, when u 2 are alone<br>  you kiss your gf at cute random times. just make it cute. she probobly would like to be kissed by you if she's giggling w/ you or flirting.<br>  <br>  good luck. all girls are different though|`|mItsW20naa	There is no special moment, just do it whenever it comes to mind.

u7HtSOqtaa	I can totally relate to what you're going through.  It seems like this girl does like you, but she's also taking you for granted.  She obviously knows that you're a nice guy and there's something about you that she finds comfort in.  The fact that she gets jealous shows that there's definitely some kind of attraction there.  I mean, if she didn't care, she wouldn't feel threatened by the possibility of being replaced.  It's important to figure out though what she's really in it for; you or the challenge of pursuing you.  Either way, communication is key.  If she makes you feel a certain way, tell her.  If she crosses the line, show her there's consequences.  You don't want her to think that she can just walk all over you.  You're a person... you have feelings; you're not some kind of game or competition.  If she truly cares for and respects you, she'll take your feelings seriously.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	yes..she trys 2 make u jelous by talkin bout otha guys infront ov ya|`|iNzRRI70aa	SOUNDS LIKE SHE LIKES YOU! ask her out before she can question any further just do it and you will be ok!!<br>  <3much love<br>  LUCkY|`|62axZ9rBaa	Hm.. I can't give you a great answer, but if you ask me, I'd say that she likes you. Also, people DO act different around their friends than they do one on one, so keep that in mind. Especially because it's often difficult to tell which side of them is how they really are- the "public" personality or the "private" personality.|`|VSXUa9lraa	I talk about my guy friends with my boyfriend and I still love him with all my heart and don't have the slightest of a crush on any of them.

That is a red flag if I ever saw one for you to get the clue she likes you and is waiting for you to take action and talk to her about if you feel the same way.|`|Jii448d2aa	If you like here, why don't you just ask her. Not to be rude but it seems you may be a "fall back guy". Someone who she's knows will always be there, because if she was really really into you, she wouldn't talk about being into other guys around you, unless she's trying to make you jealous, which is childish, either way, I think you should just be blunt.  Good Luck!|`|qIAcMeLgaa	Hmm....I don't know. It sounds like she has a flirty personality, so maybe she's flattered by all the attention that she's getting from you, but she doesn't actually like you. No offense, but I'd rethink even dating her in the first place if she calls her supposed best friend slutty, says she has a bad haircut, etc. That doesn't seem like a very genuine person.|`|6ySVF6zRaa	She probably is:<br>   1 Cheating on u<br>   2 thinks of you as a friend but hates to see you with other girls<br>   3 Loves you but loves someone else to and can't make up her mind<br>   4 Is doing a dare for "truth or dare"<br>   5 Still cheating on you<br>   6 don't know what others i have done (but me ain't no cheater thats 4 sure)|`|Q23aBtyAaa	she likes you<br>  1. gets jelous of little things<br>  2. is interessted whether ur single.<br>  3.

All girls are different, so be aware of the signs. Listen to the tone of her voice: if she's shy, the tone of her voice might be a little higher and she might start to play with her hair (smoothing it down, twirling, flipping) or adjusting her clothes. Another sign she likes you is if she laughs at a normally boring or stupid joke. (Though, don't be dumb and use bad jokes as a test or you'll just look like a comedic loser.) She may not be able to look you straight in the eye and she might giggle a lot. <br>            Watch for signs of flirting. If she's flirting, she may be difficult to read. Flirtatious girls may flirt with guys who they consider to be just friends, and it can be misconstrued as a crush. Because most girls do not want to be obvious, the flirtatious ones might flirt with you a little bit less or they might flirt with you even more. Either way, don't "flirt around". Do not flirt with other girls. If she ever sees you putting your arm around another girl or sees another girl hug you, she may jump to conclusions and assume she doesn't mean anything to you. <br>               Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous of you to touch you yet. Break the touch barrier yourself. <br>           Observe how she looks at you. If she like you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you - which means that you should probably make the first move. If she holds the stare, then she is confident and she may make the first move. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. Look for her eyes to light up when she sees you or hears your name. <br>           Look at her friends. If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling, this means that she is telling her friends about you. If her friends are loud and immature, you'll hear "(your name), (her name) likes you!" Her friends might be making it up, however, just to tease her. When she is having a conversation with her friends, and you come over, she might stop talking all of a sudden. This likely means you were the subject of the recently ended conversation. If she likes you and she told her friends about you, they might come up to you and start a random conversation about things such as: Who would you rather date?, Who do you like better?, Who is the hottest?, and such. If they name a list of about 3 people and her name is in the list, she probably told her friends about you and they're trying to search for clues to see how you feel about her. <br>        Look out for the damsel in distress. If you're outside and the girl you like is nearby and starts loudly saying "I'm cold!", that's a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweatshirt. This is a very sweet gesture, especially if you want to show the girl that you like her. If there are other guys and she likes one of those guys, however, she might act disappointed when you offer yours to her first, in which case at least you'll know how she feels and can move on. Sometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at something, and say that they can't do it. That is your cue to offer some assistance, and she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to see your reaction. <br>       Smile at her. Do a natural smile - don't freak her out. If she smiles politely, or frowns and looks away, say goodbye to her. She is obviously freaked out by you. If she returns a soft or big smile and continues to look at you, then she is interested. If she smiles then darts over to the crowd of her friends and hides in the group then she may be nervous and curious if you know that she likes you. <br>      Her Hair If she tugs on her hair or plays with it,when she is around your or when she sees you come into a room, it means she's nervous. She's nervous about seeing you. <br>         Staring Depending on how much she likes you and how good of an actress she is, she can give you long looks when your not looking or glance at you. <br>        Hallway If you see her walking down the hallway, she'll look at you once, quickly. She'll probably smile, but you know, try to contain it. <br>  She likes you dude. Maybe. Just follow my helpful steps.|`|lokj06Euaa	she might not be sure what she wants yet...<br>  <br>  <br>  she clearly likes to be around you, hang out with you, talk with you but she might not want to go out just yet.  talking about guys in front of you might be her plan to get you jealous, but be careful about the i miss you's ...  they might be said when shes lonely and bored. don't you want someone who will want you there even when shes having the best time already? its hard to say but i say get to know her more. spend more time with her and feel out the situation|`|t2W9GGjdaa	You are thinking too much! Human beings are complicated as it is - we think something, want something but say and do a different thing entirely! She may be into you but her mood/day may not be good and she may treat you bad. She might not be into you, but might be feeling sypathetic to your feelings and treat you well.<br>  <br>  The above sentence has four mights!<br>  <br>  The question is not does she like you, it's also about do you like her.<br>  <br>  Just take it slow, don't analyze and let things happen on it's own!<br>  <br>  Btw, either way, don't forget to have fun.
LXKOtuDfaa	well first... wow, that WAS long! it was like reading a page in a novel but no worries! <br>  <br>  this stuff  is hard... i don't know if i can answer a hundred percent... and help you like you would want me to. but i'll try my best.<br>  <br>  first of all... i know how you feel to a point. i've never really... lingered in a relationship for that long before. i guess i just havn't met the guy yet. but i do know what unrequited love feels like. anyways, i think... you should remember this phrase. if you love someone, you would let them go... if they come back then it was meant to be. i think this is sort of like that. i understand the fact that you really love him. and 4 months or more is normal. it's not long at all actually. getting over someone takes time. people take longer then others. especially when they were in deep. and, you are NOT a psycho. look, there are always going to be other fish in the water. don't ever feel like there's no end to a problem or there's no life after this. or life isn't worth living anymore. all that is dumb and negative. i mean, all that stuff about being positive and resilient is easier said then done... but you have to try. if he broke up if you once i'm sure he had a reason. so dont you think it's very likely it will happen again? is it really worth it? when you pick out an apple for example at a supermarket... do you always pick a good one first? not always. maybe this just wasn't the perfect apple! sorry for the analogy. so, move on darling. it will be hard, but life isn't easy. it will be over sooner or later. stay strong! be happy for your sake and to prove to him that you can be without him. maybe (i don't know) he is a nice guy. very nice even. maybe he's just lost... maybe he just still wants to have fun! you could still be friends with him when you're comfortable enough to do so! well, wish you all the luck babe =). <br>  <br>  x<br>  <br>  DAM THAT WAS LONG!|`|AA11103763	From what you are saying, he doesn't know what he wants. I think you are better off trying to get over him and move on. The worst thing would be for you to get into a pattern of breaking up (and getting hurt) then him raising your hopes again. <br>  Sorry sweetie - but 22 year old guys are pretty immature and I think you are going to get hurt more if you let him play with your head like that.|`|StoXNDBAaa	He's playing an emotional game on you.  He wants you to want him and because you didn't give him any attention at the bday party he is asking about you because you shocked him.  Don't give in and move on...the guy is using you to fulfill his emotional needs.  It is Satisfying to his ego knowing that someone is yearning for him and when you didn't give him the time of day you crushed his ego...keep it up and stay strong!|`|WrlD4xn6aa	YAY I READ THE WHOLE STORY!!! LOL.<br>  Anyways! No doubt you are still inlove with him.<br>  but you are missing the point. when he said he's love fades away for that was not an excuse. it did fade away. and the only reason it faded away that fast is cuase he met some one at then end of ya relationship. i know you love him allot but you acted crazy and any one would of done what he did " change phone number and threaten to file harassment complaint against you." you were really harassing him, and yes that pushed him away even farther. but still he chose to leave you for another grl, that's why you saw him with her. sounds like you are not too experienced in the dating world. this is not a boy or grl thing. this is the way dating works. up and down, happiness and sadness, glory and heart braking. dont get your hopes up cause he asked about you or for you. any nice guys would of done that. dont forget, he only stopped talking to you cause you was stocking and harassing him so it's not like he attentional chose it. so move on with your life. you will get over him sooner or later. Welcome to the dating world until you find the right one. and no he is not the one cause he left you. and do not, do not contact him are start acting silly. just let it be. if he wants you back, he has your number and knows where live, go to school, you r email and everything. he will contact and not just say hi then hung up. he will ask you to talk thing bring things up, apologized. not that it will happen but if it does. do not just say yay, back together, give him a hell of a heard time for everything. but back to reality. move on with your life. he left you, you already look like you are crazy over all those silly things you did when he first left you.<br>  wait you said the grl was he's fling? so he left for jump off? he is totally an *** hole. doenst matter he can be single but dnt mean anything. he might just wan2 get in your paints in and out while  smashing other grls.dont ever assume about guys cause the more you see, the less you know. same for grls. as guys we never assume. cause it's so tricky. you need to move with your life and go have fun. you are only 20 with no kid(s). this is not time for love this play time. go party, dance, drink, date, and all.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Do not get your hopes up.  It's been a long time since you broke up and he has moved on.  You got a little psycho afterwards so now he was a little concerned.  How are you going to act?  Now that you are seeing him are you going to go psycho?  Are you ok?  Have you moved on?  <br>  <br>  It's makes sense that after seeing you he would ask about you--to make sure you are ok.  That you aren't still crying yourself to sleep each night.<br>  <br>  He doesn't want you back but he did love you so he doesn't want you to be miserable for the rest of your life.  You need to start trying to move on.<br>  <br>  There is the chance that he and his new girlfriend just broke up and he was merely having a deep night.  A night where you think a lot about What Might have been.  At 22 though he is no where near marriage and neither are you.  So try to move on and date more people and make sure you've really discovered what you want in life.  Your first love is never something you get over but you don't know what's wrong with your first love b/c you don't know who you are or what you want in life yet.  So the fresh new experience of love is perfect.  Later on you realize that it was the New Experience that made it seem so perfect.|`|K1iUzewyaa	I just want to say your young and have a good life ahead of you. I believe that your ex had broken up with you because he had another girl on the side. I think he possibly blocked you from my space, texting, etc, because his new girl was wondering what's up.. I think that eventually that relationship failed, once he realized what an awesome girl you were, he realized he messed up. Of course he was probably wondering what was going on in your mind.. He expects you to jump up and do what you said " run to him," because that is what you did in the past.. You were given a sign into how this guy is going to be. To say I love you, and the next day leave you flat, and then block you from "myspace" and texting, phone number, it's just a sign that this guy is possibly not the right one for you. Remain strong, and see what his intentions are, but be aware that was wrong what he did. You should see through it.

8a2ebc183110448f4c3847d3aa539174aa	Its very common for Catholics to say grace before eating, so I am not sure how being of different religions matters on this particular issue.<br>  <br>  Also it would be rude on her behalf to say grace without everyone being at the table.<br>  <br>  From reading this I get the impression that the issue isn't about saying grace. It seems its more about you feeling like you have to defend yourself and feeling like she is on the attack with her own religion. <br>  <br>  I suggest looking at the bigger picture. She is the mother of your husband. She raised him and helped him become the man that he is, so rightly he would be very important to her and she to him. And now you are important to him as his wife. And by exension, have significant influence on him and her.<br>  <br>  It will make things easier in the long run if you could find a way in your heart to be a little more tolerant of the little things. But this does not mean be a doormat. Its appropriate to stand up for your beliefs for big things.<br>  <br>  Maybe the 2 of you could sit down and have a heart to heart about how you each feel and agree on some boundaries that you can both live by.|`|Eug52iQDaa	Next time try sitting at the table and bow your head while they pray.  It's respectful.  However, if you choose not to pray that is your choice and they should respect it.  You and your husband need to come to an agreement on how to handle the interference before you have children and the problem blows out of proportion.|`|PnS3wHQiaa	You're both wrong. God doesn't exist.|`|zBhwEbUkaa	I agree that it is inappropriate. She knows that you don't share the same religion, and in your own house, she should respect your views. If you don't want to pray, then you shouldn't, not even "just for her." The next time you see her, sit down with her and gently explain to her your feelings and maybe y'all can come to an understanding. Good luck.|`|vZMN82U8aa	threaten her with the inquisition... and point out that pentecostalism isnt recognised as a religion... certainly not by the catholics, who lets face it, dont recognise any other church... <br>  <br>  she wants to pray, give her a mat and show her where mecca lies...|`|7XIa76Usaa	What God do you serve? Look in the front of your Bible and you will find where it says "study". You will be surprised what is written on the inside or are you scared what you will find written there.|`|N86vHKxtaa	Two things.  First, Catholics DO pray before meals (we call it grace) which I think you know.  Being flexible about relatively small things like this is an important part of keeping your family happy.<br>  <br>  Second, I think your M-I-L probably wants to keep control of her son and his family.  It's an issue he will need to take up with her since you will surely just fight with your husband's mother to no purpose than bad feelings all around- she won't hear you and will resent your actions just as quickly as you have been insulted by her demands on you.<br>  <br>  My sincere recommendation is a long, quiet chat with your husband about his family relationships and your mutual expectations about religious practices.  Once you start raising children, religious beliefs could become a major bone of contention unless you work at it now.|`|zuyrHoc9aa	"She says, well...for me?"  <br>  <br>                It is inappropriate, talk with her politely and ask her why she would want you to pray to God "for her".  If you are going to pray before you eat, it's so "you" can thank God.  You're not praying to her or for her.  She can pray for herself if she would like to, but you praying to thank God for food isn't going to do a thing for her...especially if that's not what you do.  <br>                I am a Christian, but religion has twisted so many people.|`|ESFo4rXuaa	Well, I am pentecostal and my mother always taught me to say grace before you eat- especially @ the dinner table so I don't really see it as much but if you want to take it a certain way then that's you.|`|sbxDX97uaa	i agree, that's inappropriate. you should politely talk to her and tell her to respect you and not force that on you|`|ThnKiLfTaa	I do agree that it is disrespectful and pushy for her to keep trying to get you to change your beliefs. She should respect your beliefs just as I am sure you respect hers. Unfortunately, between family members there can be some tension sometimes when it comes to these kind of things. Have you tried talking to her and telling her how it makes you uncomfortable that she won't respect you and your husband's beliefs? When it comes to things like saying grace before meals then the best advice I can offer is for each person to respect whom ever's home your in at the time. If your eating dinner at her house then respect that she does say grace before eating. If she is eating dinner at your house then ask her to please respect the fact that you don't. If your eating out then I would say to each's own. She can bless her food herself if she wants but not to expect you to join in. Best of luck!<br>  Just out of curiosity I am Christian I was raised Baptist, and am not too familiar with the Catholic's beliefs. I was just wondering why you choose not to say grace before eating? Is it just a personal decision of your own? Or is that part of the Catholic's beliefs, and why? I am not trying to be rude or disrespectful I am just curious. Thank you!|`|hQmZP38qaa	Hi, :)<br>  <br>  I use to be Catholic, but I no longer practice that religion.  I am now non-denominational.  I think that everyone should have right to there opinion and beliefs.  If you have children, it is good for you to show them how to pray, that way they learn by watching you and how you deal with the situation.  <br>  <br>  Now if it just you and your mother-in-law, at your house, then since it is your house, you have the right to do what you feel comfortable doing.<br>  <br>  If you were at her house, then I would respect her wishes and bow my head for prayer as she prays over the meal.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with being Pentecostal, it is just a different type of way of having a relationship with God, other than just religion.  Where ever you get spiritually feed, is where you should be comfortable.<br>  <br>  But altogether, it is your house and like I mentioned above if you have children, teach them the way they should go and they will not depart from it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you and you don't find this message offensive.  Have a great weekend.|`|tjj7nO9maa	It doesnt matter what religion you guys are...she should respect you as a person and realize you can make your own decisions. If she doesnt like your choices then she doesnt have to be there. I totally understand how you are stuck in between playing the Nice guy for your husbands sake and sticking up for yourself.....my husbands family thinks its inappropriate to ask visitors to sanitize their hands before holding a new baby.(LOL) Just make your wishes known to her and let her know if she cant respect that then she will just have to endure getting her feelings hurt. Or take her lazy a** home and cook her own food!
vxPrPsD2aa	Alright, I'm currently going through the EXACT same thing, except Army. I've been in your situation for a year. If you are living out of Government Quarters, he HAS to send you money. It's by Military Law (Army law... not too sure about Marine law). I had to be forceful with my soon to be ex husband, because he refused to send me any spousal support, so finally I went to the Inspector General and they opened up a Military Case, and forced him to send me $700 a month until the divorce is final. I would go to your Inspector Generals office, and see what they can do for you. It'll be opened as a case, and all you gotta do is tell him what's going on. They should send a mamorandum of spousal support to his chain of command. He can get into a TON of trouble for being with someone else while he is with you (example- Brig, NJP'd, Rank goes away with half a months pay). If the car is in your name, fight for it. Go to a lawyer, and you can probably tell him what's going on and he can lead you in the right direction. But, it should be a Free Legal Aid. My soon to be ex husband, waited until he got back from Iraq to start the divorce process because the money is tax free out there, and he's racking up all that extra pay. Until then, I also suggest you go to your Chaplian and see if there's a chaplians fund, or go to your food bank on base if you have one. I had to resort to that for months and months. The Chaplians fund if there is one, will give you $100, $150, or a $300 check, that they make out to you. They will send you to the Commisary and you will have to use the WHOLE check at once ($300 for one person for groceries goes a LOOONG way... trust me). You can also try going to a different chain of command and see what they can do for you. They should give you all the information, just like JAG can for the spousal support.<br>  Only problem with Legal Aid on military bases, they will just HELP with the divorce paperwork. You cannot go through a divorce process through the military, because a divorce isn't military related. If you end up going to court, it'll be through civilian court. If you want to get him real good where it hurts, talk to his Chain of Command, and let them know he is cheating on you and refuses to send you support. As for his First Sgt not getting ahold of you, call and call and keep calling until you get ahold of him. If his Chain of Command will not help you, you can even get them in trouble too by going to your Inspector Generals office. Which the IG office should be your LAST resort, because it'll look good on you that you went through all your resources before going to him/her.<br>  You can file in the state that you are a legal resident of. Since you are not solvent (meaning you can't pay for court fees, and all that), you can get him to pay for all that. You can go to civilian court for Abandonment, Adultery (only this is hard to prove), and also Neglect. Girl if you ask me, the ball is totally in your court for a divorce.<br>  So in a nutshell;<br>  Civilian World- Get a pro-bono lawyer.<br>  Military World- Nag at his Chain of Command until you get help from them, go to the Chaplian/Food bank on base. Have JAG walk you through steps for a divorce if you haven't done so, and ask them what you can do if he refuses to sign the papers. Lastly if none of them help you; Go to the IG office. I hope this helps... email me if you need anymore help.|`|QYbMxFE0aa	my fiance is in the military and he JUST told me the other day that it is ILLEGAL for someone in the military to cheat. he can get arrested for cheating on you. i would report it to his officer or at least to the marines. call the base he is located on and tell them exactly what you said here. he can get in big trouble for getting bah pay. he doesn't want to be with you but you are still allowing him to use you for extra money a month?!?!?! that is insane! get ahold of someone and take care of this asap! what he did is ILLEGAL!! take care of it!|`|rawz0RJuaa	oh gosh i am sorry to hear this!<br>  you need to go down to where he is stationed and demand to speak to his first SGT immediately ASAP and tell every superior that has anything to do with him exactly what you just wrote in this post! he will be in a whirlwind of trouble!<br>  how dare him. <br>  he is not allowed to have any type of relations on deployment.<br>  also, once they find out what he is doing/has done, he will be demoted and severely punished- however probably not near what he really deserves!<br>  get down there and let them all know!!<br>  he may even get a dishonorable discharge. dont be afraid to stand up for yourself!|`|u1uECuFNaa	PURSUE it.<br>  Call and make appointments and go to each person...higher if you have to.<br>  Don't let him get away with that. <br>  Him accepting BAH and not the divorce papers can get him in trouble.<br>  Good luck to you.|`|IvMPh09baa	go online to your local county website, look up divorce and do it on your own!|`|434c6f306298f12f4324bc49555661cbaa	JAG is a good start.

Nwp3Ar9taa	It sounds like you are between a rock and a hard place. More than likely you are overwhelmed with the household chores and he has it made because you do everything for him. What started out as you doing these things out of love has now put you over a barrel because he expects them of you. Now you feel that he takes you for granted(he probably does) and you resent that.  Am I close?<br>  <br>  Sit him down and tell him how you feel. Tell him that things have to change....POST HASTE Tell him how that many times when couples with children get divorced the father only gets to see his children at best 50% of the time as opposed to them being with him all the time now. Take a few minutes out of your day to pray about your situation and ask him to pray with you. Ask God to open your heart to understand what it's gonna take to fix your problem. Have some faith and you will see results. Be patient because this relationship didn't derail over night and it won't be corrected in a night.<br>  <br>  God Bless you|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Get some marriage counseling. It is very easy to let the relationship you have together go by the wayside when you have children. You obviously don't spend any time just being a couple, you really need to.|`|IFd94XDkaa	Sounds to me like you need a third party to help you two learn to communicate.  It sounds like you're blaming your husband because he feels he can't talk to you but what is it that you do that makes him feel that way?  It's most that there is blame on both sides but neither of you may be willing to recognize it and take responsibility for it.  A counselor of some sort will help you work that out.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	My wife and I have been in the same boat, married over 12 years.  I think we've been in trouble mode for at least 5 years.  <br>  <br>  From my male perspective, almost all of my unhappiness is from lack of sex and affection.  That's it, nothing else.  It would take my wife about 30 minutes per week in total to take me from 1 to 8 on the happiness scale, yet she will not or cannot for reasons I cannot understand.<br>  <br>  When I ask her what I can do to help her or to help the situation, she can't come up with anything.  We've finally gone to counseling and it's helping a little, but the bad times are now a memory and lots has been damaged.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard to be a mother but when the man is honestly trying and the woman can't show any physical affection, I blame it on her.  I hope that someday in heaven someone will explain this to me.|`|tjj7nO9maa	Check and see if your job has an EAP. They provide free counseling. If they dont tell them to look into the EAP my job has which is www.firstsuneap.com<br>  <br>  They were phenominal in getting my husband and I the help we needed and getting us back on track. TheY find the counseor for you, pay for the sessions, and everything. Plus if things do go astray, they have free legal help.<br>  <br>  Dont rely on things to get better by themself. TAKE ACTION.

Your children will have a happier childhood if they don't have to be in a house with that kind of vibe.|`|xzQhXCCaaa	I agree your kids cannot be around that it is too much for them too see there mother down and feeling sad. It is not good for you either. Hurtting that deeply and without communication your lost.
657b064eb5cd0984478523a31970625caa	Oh, honey do I feel your pain. My daughter is 8 and my son is 3. My daughter is a little chatter box and goes off on random subjects that have nothing to do with anything we are doing. Like were having dinner and she goes into a tangit about vampires or fairies. And my son, he will defy until the count of 3. Its a normal thing. Just be patient. They will grow out of it. And when you really need to get them to listen, get down on your knees and look them eye to eye, this works best on my son because then he knows I'm serious. Try to be consistent and keep a routine. I'm an Air Force wife, and everytime we get re-stationed my kids routines get all messed up and they act out for a while. Its something we have to deal with as a military family. Everything will be okay. If you ever want to chat, feel free to contact me through the email attached to my profile. One military wife to another, I'll help with any questions you have. Good luck.|`|zhkiUFGfaa	I belive that just the way it is when you have kids. this to will pass. in about twenty years.|`|rbtO73eZaa	idk|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	Sounds normal to me.  They grow out of it....eventually.|`|5MAx8mHxaa	that's a smart kid using diversionary tactics, why are bananas yellow.less talking and more spanking.let them learn the hard way .What the dog bit you? Cause you kicked him.I'm not saying beat the kid, a quick swat will get the point across faster than a lecture.good luck|`|79wOWoM0aa	They do what they do because it works.  They don't care about banans being yellow - it's a distraction.  <br>  <br>  Tell them that interrupting their parents is a household felony and is punishable by up to 5 minutes time out.  <br>  <br>  You MUST get control.  My wife and I used 1-2-3 timeout and it worked great.  Hell my daughter is 17 now and we STILL do it haha.<br>  <br>  Having CONSISTENT rules and expectations is the key.  You and your husband must have the same rules, and you must never relent on them.  The kids WILL learn to respect you.  Currently, they are just wearing you down.|`|a2597c46ddff47ff43c9c7ca0f8d84eaaa	Take a deep breath and relax. They are kids, they will grow out of this stage and be in another AAAGGGHHH stage before you know it..LOL. Its not your parenting and you haven't done anything wrong, they are kids, and they act that way. Stages vary for every kid, but it sounds like they are in one. Why don't you all just take a time out, run out in the yard acting silly. Every once and a while just be a kid again with them. Talk about a great stress reliever. I mean, have you ever wondered why bananas are yellow, how come the sky is blue, why don't fish have teeth....etc. Go outside and walk and find a million things to wonder about and then figure them out together. Its a great experience looking at the world through your kids' eyes and a great stress reliever. Keep up the good work!|`|qf0kuMCiaa	Yes this is what kids do..I have two 10 and 8..you better believe they do the same kinds of things to me and my hubby..They can cause you to pull some of your hairs out..But just wait until they get old..I plan  to drive my kids nuts lol..   It seems that you and your Husband are doing everything right no need to worry. Being a parent is a hard job..But you can make it easy by not being to hard on yourself.  When I tell my kids something they come up with their own answer for it. I  tell them let me talk then when I am done.  do they wait no they being as soon a I open my mouth.|`|vIacPEXdaa	Honey I have four. We go thru this same thing. We have constant fighting and punish over and over again. When nothing else works we resort to spanking. However that doesn't work with every child.Walking away doesn't work either.I know you don't want to but you may have swat their behinds and let them know that you are no longer going to put up with their behavior. Of course they are kids and want to know why about everything. But they need to understand that talking while you are talking will not go on anymore. Just stand your ground and don't budge.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	It is  most likely the age. They feel that they did something wrong and are trying to change the subject or distract you. Just continue with your talk and ignore their irrelevant questions. My daughter learned that if she had a question while I was speaking to hold up a finger and I would address it when it was appropriate. This helped (some) with the interruptions.|`|bO2rzfISaa	Your explanations are probably too long. Problems seem associated with your return to work. Your kids are really little, so you'd better figure this out...wait until they're stealing the car (hopefully, just kidding). Good luck.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	Welcome to parenthood, you're not alone. Enjoy!!

bO2rzfISaa	My daughter is 26 and I'm finally collecting arrearages (with an order in place from when she was a baby). Give it a shot, what do you have to lose?|`|NeTNnvSZaa	No, it's been too long.

Its been too long.|`|IKXZZDH9aa	The correct answer according to CA Family Code is this:<br>  <br>  291.  (a) A money judgment or judgment for possession or sale of<br>  property that is made or entered under this code, including a<br>  judgment for child, family, or spousal support, IS ENFORCEABLE UNTIL PAID OR OTHERWISE SATISFIED.<br>  <br>  You are a party of the order, as was your Dad and Mom. You have the right to sue on your own behalf to recover the unpaid support.|`|AA12041870	Your mother could file for the back child support, but you can't.  She is the one that took him to court in the first place.  I don't believe there is anything you can do to get the support, especially since you are not the one that sued him for it in the first place.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Your first answer is correct but both of you can sue for back support owed your mom. If she has an copy of hr divorce decree or you can get one from the county records office where the divorce took place, would help tremendously here. Also any known whereabouts of your father will save loads of time too
dFHsAXDMaa	He is saying " HI I am a lying cheating looser why wouldn't you want to date me.... You know I would never truly care about you ....

Are you not going in front of troubles? Is he worth it?<br>  What makes you think that he'll treat you any differently than he treats that girl, as surely, if he's really into you, he'd set the record straight with her and then would come and see you. <br>  <br>  Just wait and see.

izQn53q2aa	It sounds like this is none of your business.  Which offends you more about your friends significant other, the fact that she's female or that she from public school?|`|ESQzBFOraa	She doesn't like guys, she likes girls, its okay , just move on.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Who knows maybe its the real thing, maybe she is just experimenting.  Won't know until she gets older and then some people still experiment.  Except your friend for who she is or move on.|`|ESFo4rXuaa	I understand where you are coming from. Sometimes it takes that 1 person to get into someones head and turn them out. I'm guessing your friend sees the excitement she was lacking in private school and is experimenting. Give it some time- hopefully she will grow out of it.|`|iy75lge3aa	Cool man.|`|BwNiS2Hmaa	what's rebelling against  you're parents have to do with this...|`|uiQGzWLFaa	1. Some people are scared to admit they're gay, my mom is a transgender, so I live with 2 moms, and i know how many people just don't like the idea of gay/transgender/bi people. So it could be that she was afraid to lose friends (my mom's own GRANDMOTHER disowned her just because she was accidentally born in the wrong body, some people think that being gay or transgender is wrong.)<br>  <br>  2. She might not have been sure, if she was dating guys but it just didn't feel right, she might have tried dating a girl, and found that that was right.<br>  <br>  3. You cant make anyone gay, turning gay doesn't happen, you are gay but don't find out until you actually try it with someone of the same gender.<br>  <br>  4. be sure to stick by her, she might be in for a rough time because, like i said, some people just are afraid of gays, she might even lose friends, close friends; so be sure to be by her side if she needs help.

AA12398373	In Canada, we have something similar that is known as CPP, or the Canada Pension Plan.<br>  In order to draw from the CPP a person has to have paid into it. You can't get back any more than you have paid in, so if she never paid in, then she can't collect any benefits from it.<br>  <br>  She may be able to apply for social assistance, but she will never be able to establish residency here, if she is trying to enter Canada as an economic refugee.<br>  <br>  If she can gain employment here in Canada, then she can pay in to the CPP, and also build up retirement savings in one or more RRSP's when she is ready to retire, but I think she will have to remain a resident of Canada in order to collect benefits from CPP.
5s3uFazlaa	Don't feel bad.  You know in your heart that you did nothing to her.  Some people are just really ignorant.  You can't help it.  Instead of trying to talk to her, go to a group of girls that you kniow have similiar intrests...for example, if you like art, talk to a couple of girls that are in the art club.  When I first started high school 2 years ago, I was the only girl from my old school to make it into honors courses, so I ddin't know anybody.  When everyone started tnalking after class, I went up to a girl who wasn't talking to anyone either.  we got to talking and she was in the same situation I was in...we have been the bestest of friends ever since.  Be open to new people...if they don't like you, move on.|`|TDO6UGWWaa	She's just being a typical snobby chick. Just don't say anything else to her and don't try to be friends with her because no offense but she obviously doesn't like you and if she is popular or has a lot of friends she probably doesn't think your good enough to be her friend. So leave her alone and don' t say nothing to her don't even ask her a question because a snobby chick like that doesn't deserve your friendship and hopefully she'll realize how good of a person you are once you settle into the school and everyone starts liking you. :-)|`|Qz4n1l0zaa	yeah being new sucks cause you don't really know who to talk to...just find someone else in class to talk to cause the more you deal with this girl, the more you are going to not like her...i can tell|`|m8C8MU2Maa	My dad was in the Navy so we moved to a lot of different schools.

That way you can get joint custody of the children (at the least) and be able to request she go to counseling for parental alienation. I am not for divorce at all, but sometimes it is for the best and no one has any other options. This sounds like one of those times. Also see your lawyer first and ask about the fact that she can not afford the mortgage on her own, and make sure you serve her first with the separation papers. She sounds like the type that will try to take you for all you have and then some. Beat her to the punch and get out for your kids sake. She needs a lot of counseling before she will ever grow up and act like an adult.|`|bzE5hH8Maa	you are not in a good situation. I would suggest marriage counseling. If she refuses not to work on the marriage then you may seek a divorce.Many times in a marriage the Wife loves her children more then her husband. which pushes the husband away.    sad part is   eventually the kids get lives of there own and move  away, which leaves the women alone. Best scenario..... live to gether raise ur kids & date other women! divorces are usually expensive and it divides the children. remember the best thing u can do for ur child is to love there mother.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	as long as you don't force her to have sex or raise a hand to her in any way, most probably she cannot have you out of your home.  that said, you need to be careful but stand your ground on things like working out your marriage as well as caring for your children and solving your economic issues. if this all fails, you're going to be looking at a messy divorce and then you may end up paying all this and more.  tough situ man, good luck.|`|fznvQptlaa	i think you should leave her. sounds as if u aren't worth much more to her than a paycheck and a pawn. sad. it doesn't sound very fulfilling. i would call it quits and build yourself back up. i think its very possible for her to hv u removed and made to pay all or at least a portion of the bills and mortgage for a period of time at least during the initial separation|`|xnrGBXHcaa	You have the right to be treated like a human being my friend. This will be a very painful time for you, but you should stand up for yourself and try to work things out with her, not get pushed around. Working things out works both ways. She needs to understand that.|`|m8C8MU2Maa	Oh yea she can do that.  I'd suspect she learned that from somebody after she left.  I think you should talk to a divorce lawyer.|`|CFp1hXHEaa	she probably realized it wasn't easy on her own so she moved back to get you to pay for things (being she doesn't want to work on the marriage.) but before you go straight to the divorce... think about your kids because the kids always suffer the most in a divorce. I would definitely make sure it was 'over' before actually filing. <br>  <br>  But at the same time I would let your lawyer know whats going on and he could help you from there. That way you know your options for in case you do go through with a divorce.<br>  <br>  Good Luck I hope everything works out for the best.|`|Nwp3Ar9taa	You are in for a rough ride. She can boot you out and in some states make you pay the mortgage. There are many variables to consider but she could make your life rough for a few years.<br>  <br>  My best advice for you is to obey her every command. Be her lap dog! Play by her rules. It may sound like I'm advising you to tuck your tail, guess what?! I am. <br>  <br>  You need to do all these things while you search her soul and find out what her motives are for coming back. More than likely, someone has told her that she could have you removed. The thing is you have to do something really stupid to get kicked out. If she picks a fight, walk away. Don't leave the house though. <br>  <br>  Take time to pray for her and for your family. Ask God to help you through this tough time. Then ask her to pray with you. Have faith and it will pay off more than you could ever imagine.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
P0Fjh59Eaa	Very ridiculous! why didn't you guys have sex while you were pregnant!? you know you can right? lol<br>  <br>  I had sex w/my hubs up until i was 9 months pregs and ready to pop! i think you need to get to the bottom of this issue.<br>  <br>  Kittykatsback- only a man w/serious issues is like that! my husband saw all of his children being born and still finds me desirable! good lord! lol|`|4POGapREaa	Just as ridiculous as my situation which is close to yours.  You just hit the point of no return & it's too awkward to get back to where you were.  It takes one person to be very bold & initiate it strongly or else you'll just sit there forever being polite to each other & ignoring the huge elephant in the room.  I'm not willing to be the man in this particular situation & beg someone for sex, so I guess I won't be having it anytime soon.  It's sad & it goes beyond the physical into affecting how you feel about yourself as a woman.  All I know is that it's not healthy & can only lead to bad things down the road if someone doesn't step up & take the initiative.  Might as well just have a roommate who pays rent on time & doesn't use your bathroom.|`|AnW3dzQfaa	That's ridiculous.  You might want to see if he has someone on the side.  Or, he probaly just isn't in love with you anymore.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Unheard of. Why don't you want to have sex? What is the point in being married? If he is not ready to initiate it then you should. One evening put the baby to bed and greet him at the door in your birthday suit, when he comes home from work. Before his shock subsides, just whip it out and go down on him. Chances are excellent that he will rip his clothes off and jump your bones.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Are you happy with that little amount? If so, then it's nobody's business. But if you want more, there needs to be some serious talking for the two of you.|`|AA10020760	Lots of people decide not to have sex. Perhaps you and he should get a hormone level test to make sure you have no health problem.|`|a2390e6e9406ac2ed8d818754e58f0e7aa	you both need to talk about your feeling with eachother...|`|o1yy6KABaa	Sounds to me like you have just hit a flat patch in your marriage..the stress of you being pregnant and having a new born can do that to any couple. Try and get the spice back into the relationship. You dont feel like having sex becuase you havent had it in so long. Plan a romantic night with you and hubby (get a baby sitter if you can) have a nice dinner with the two of you, run a bubble bath and relax. You both just need to get back into the swing of things again.|`|iZbgUtxcaa	If he actually saw the baby come out, you are doomed.<br>  <br>  This is very common, men freak out and can never see you as a sexual object after you become a mother.<br>  <br>  THAT is why I will never let the father of my children see them come out.  You never know if a man will turn until he actually sees it happen.|`|BItkg1f0aa	Thats what I call an ***. I feel bad for you. He is probably too into what magazines have that he doesn't know what real things should look like. Good luck on everything. Tell him you had <br>  HIS baby. He should not be like this to you.|`|7XIa76Usaa	Your marriage is in serious trouble. Baby or no Baby you better get your love like back into the bedroom. Keep him happy at home and his eyes will stay home.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	The solution to this problem is to unzip his pants, take it out, and put it in your mouth - instant sex.|`|uUrJwk7Faa	14-15 months without sex sounds horrible. I suggest initiating it or talking to him about it.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Talk with him about it|`|vwOcFXgcaa	Look. I normally don't encourage breaking up homes. However, there arew THOUSANDS of lonley men out there who would love to get to know you better. So with that info, tell your husband that a marriage is ALL or NOTHING. If sex is important to you, then it should be important to him. If it is not, then there is a more serious issue. <br>  <br>   I watched both of my kids be born and I still hit it like a caveman. You need communication, assistance, and some couseling. <br>  <br>     And perhaps a trip to Christie's Toybox in Lawton, OK and Wichita Falls, TX. Can't spice up your love life if the pantry is empty, catch my drift?|`|0ZTrJaRLaa	Wow, you are holding a record there. Do not become insecure and allow your mind to wander. People may express their opinion that he is cheating but there are people (men included) than can go without sexual contact. You simply have to get to the root of the problem and address the issue.<br>  <br>  If this is your first pregnancy, it could be that your husband sees you in a different light. This can be a good or bad thing. You won't know until you talk about it. Be open to his answers and make him feel that he can tell you anything. You want to work on this together.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Many couples actually survive quite well without a sex life so it all depends on the couple and what each is willing to put up with to make the marriage work. So this isnt as ridiculous as it may seem|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I would call it troubling.  I think you need to communicate with your spouse if you want any answers.|`|79wOWoM0aa	What does he say?

cFsPNXkiaa	My advice would be to take no friends with you<br>  Doing stuff in the cinema is vague but i know that sometimes i'm to into the movie to do anything so watch that one<br>  Make conversation find common ground and stick to it ask loads of questions about the common ground|`|hdoOcMFNaa	y do you have a boyfreind that you dont even talk 2 in person|`|7PbJWEo1aa	you could sit next to him and hold his hand nd I think thats about it if your going with you girlie friends!|`|p3szz8g2aa	well if hes gonna be too nervous, then make the first move yourself otherwise its gnna be an endless "awkwardness." if u both are shy, then nothings gonna happen. cant just keep thinkin hes gonna do something first, cuz maybe hes noot. eh well gud luck|`|AnhoHRFTaa	What does "Dno," "Wat," and "Wiv," mean? Please advise then I can answer your question. Thank you|`|vbsNdIluaa	Well Baby Cat you are obviously a snob.|`|fEgK96Rhaa	hand holding is nice.|`|2992c9f572b21b27b8cb0f9e0f893ddaaa	Erm.. Well i wouldnt advise talking to him during the movie cause that can be so anoying! Just snuggle down, he might put his arm round you or hold your hand. Talk before and after the movie, before about all sorts of things like what he's been up to, his top 10 favourite movies, Music, family all sorts of stuff. Then after the movie ask him if he enjoyed it and his favourite parts. Ugh why are you going with your friends?? Make it a romantic date and just go together. If your friends are their it might totally ruin the mood and it makes it more uncomfterble, especially if he kisses you.|`|pDQIAuzNaa	Why do you need to go to the cinema to "do stuff" with him?<br>  Stay at home you gross little creatures.|`|SLtjbV0Baa	try and be more confident, and make loads of conversation.<br>  and get with him if it feels right.|`|XI74yGYUaa	well, you could try relaxing and watching the movie!<br>  pda is a no-no.|`|XDeEs5qwaa	watch the movie<br>  making out in movies in tackey<br>  I have never done that|`|Mp23b7acaa	if ur making out u won't have to talk ;)
e67e5dfc74c396a718533bd7b4a5f8fbaa	your relationship with your sister is not normal, and think she may of realised that too, i am very surprised that if this is a true case that this has gone on for so long, you do not say how old your sister is apart from a large age gap, which also is alarming.<br>  Speak to your parents, and get help, you will be ridiculed for this relationship by everyone so seek help you need it.|`|hdoOcMFNaa	thats gross|`|jxpV13rTaa	hahah ohhhh please tell me its a joke..either that or your both going to jail|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	Oh holy ****. you better stop before something would be happen.

Are you just jealous...or will you suffer a huge loss to your heart if you let him go?<br>  <br>  you need to ask youself just how important he is to you and then act on it and dont look back! if that means letting go, do so. if it means fighting for him...then do so w/a power that knocks that other chick right off the planet!|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	do you want him back because you are in love with him or because this t--ck wants him? your husband has some responsiblity here too he can tell her to go away.|`|tao83sDxaa	do not stand down. you are not divorced and you can still work things out. she should not included in this equasion. you have been married for 23 yrs, who in the heck does she think she is. your hubby likes to be pampered by her, you need to work things out.|`|f6YsGOynaa	Fight tooth and nail if you want to keep him.  Find every dirty trick in the book and use it, if you have to.  File a restraining order, if you can.  Find any way possible to get her out of your life...hire a professional if you have to.

Are you going to let this other woman win?  She wants your husband and to have that control.

Kick her butt into the dirt.|`|a2390e6e9406ac2ed8d818754e58f0e7aa	if he wants to be with you then sure fight for him or else it will only be a frustrating losing battle.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	Legally there is nothing you can do because when you separated (in the eyes of the law) you did so with the intentions of divorce--thus your soon to be ex is free to date whomever he so chooses and it is not adultery. <br>  <br>  That said if you love your husband and really want him back then all you can do is tell him how you feel and show him you are serious---turn catty with the other woman or threaten her and he is likely to turn against you. Men don't like a lot of drama and she who causes the least will probably win out in the end.|`|OrW1qFtbaa	fight !|`|jCMSybAnaa	Fight for your man.  Also make sure he wants to work things out.  Don't do anything silly, but fight by being the wife he needs and start fixing yourself up a little.  He'll notice the little changes.  She has nothing on 23 years!  You make her look like a bimbo.|`|z1C75GIaaa	You were married for 23yrs, so why are you asking if you should fight for your husband?

Tell her that you are still in love with your husband and you understand that she has an animal attraction for him but you need her to take a step back. Be as nice and mature as you can... just tell her that you are really wanting to work things out. Show her that you are human with feelings and not just the crazy ex. Do not do anything mean cause then she will want to retaliate. I am so sorry for this situation you are in.. but if this marriage is worth saving.... I say, Fight for it... but fight fairly... and make sure he is worth fighting for.....|`|qvMYsDtZaa	You don't really have a battle with the other woman....it's a battle of the wills with your husband.  He, and only he....NOT HER  has the control of  working things out with you.  You already know this and you are in denial about it because it's easier for you to believe that it is her that is keeping him away from you instead of his own choosing.   23 years in a marriage with him says you know your husband a lot better than any of these people on here.  Does he love you?  Did he leave because HE wanted to or because you asked him to?  Sounds like he's took full advantage of your wanting to separate and now wants to run away from owning up to his actions  .... like letting a dog off a leash.   He's involved with this woman (blaming you) refusing to end it (blaming her)  and you honestly want to know if you should fight for him, Really?  Think about that. You need to put your feelings and marital intentions for your marriage on the table with your husband and then give him a clear ultimatum....."End it with the other woman, come home within the next 24 hours and lets work on our marriage/relationship or there WILL be a divorce filed"    If he doesn't respond to this, you may have to accept that your husband does not want to come back.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	There comes a time when a man or woman has to fight for what is legally theirs. So just how much do you love/want your husband and marriage? Remember, a woman scourned can be a very scary person when someone comes between her and her man!  I think youve wasted enough time so dig in and fight like hell. good luck and have fun|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	I say it's up to your spouse to let her know you are trying to work things out and he can tell her to back off.  You shouldn't have to fight.  If you TWO are trying to work it out, then it's up to him to tell her it's over between them and he's going back to his wife.  You shouldn't have to.  That should be on him, unless he has doubts.  And wants to keep some on the side.  idk|`|dr8BREXLaa	Ok, your first mistake is saying she wont let your husband work out his feelings...Your husband has a brain yes?? If he wants to give your relationship a chance then he needs to tell the other woman to get lost..If he hasn't done that, then I'd tell your husband to get lost...Fighting for someone is stupid, and a waste of time.. If you have to fight there isn't anything left..Move on. PS 3-4 months?? After 23 yrs?? and hes already letting someone else in?? haha Id boot him.|`|a2597c46ddff47ff43c9c7ca0f8d84eaaa	Well first of all you shouldn't have to "fight" your husband should be man enough to tell this woman the he LOVES his WIFE and you two are working out your problems. If he has done this and you are sure you and him can make it work, then tell the b&tch to back off!|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	HELLO.  Why do women always want to blame the other woman.  What about the husband?  He must be doing something to encourage this other woman.  I wouldn't do anything, maybe you should start seeing another man and see how the husband likes that.  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.|`|vIacPEXdaa	If you love him stand and fight. Let her know that you are married to him. She's not.

xJZSpsRhaa	Not sure how old you are.  But, could be possible your sex drive is starting to go down hill.  I've been dating this girl for about 4-5months and i don't feel like having ssex with her.

Not a girlfriend.|`|AorhZF06aa	just do it- stop making things difficult|`|ehq6W1mtaa	The reason that you probably are not having the  "urge to have sex with her" is because you probably respect her more than your other girlfriends. That being said it is probably just yourself telling you that when you asked her to be your girlfriend it wasn't for the sex or lust but more-so because you felt a real connection to her. I wouldn't offer any solutions because there really isn't a problem. You're in love. :) Hope it helps!|`|CN6szTrZaa	I know what you mean, I've felt the same way before. My reasoning I found was that I had more respect for the girl then that. I can tell you really love her because this lack of sexual drive your having is most likely because you don't want anything to happen to her. This is what I consider the type of relationship in which you could easily see yourself married to her. Not that I'm saying propose to her but you know what I mean. The other girls you may have liked but you knew it wouldn't last. Hope I helped.|`|qKpgMkjSaa	Dude my grilfriend and I waited 6 months before having sex Im 24 and she's 23 and both of our "numbers" with others are on the higher side for our age.

KPXwwwMMaa	I would definitely tell an adult about this. You're a really good friend to stick with someone through cutting, depression, or anything else. It's very tiring to be a supportive friend, sometimes. <br>  <br>  It does sound like your friend is still dealing with some serious depression issues, and may be suicidal. I would tell her parents. If you don't know her parents and aren't comfortable with that, then i would tell a school counselor. <br>  <br>  No matter how much you stick with your friend, it may not help her. If she's dealing with serious issues like this, she needs a professional counselor.

You both will be grown and out of the house before long.|`|ilx6DeVYaa	maybe you should try working with your sister. maybe make it a game or something? like, tell her that you're going to do spring cleaning, and that you have to clean up so she can find more cool things to collect (not that you think her stuff is cool, but it will appeal to her sense of security in her stuff). tell her that she can find 10 things, maybe 15 if they are small, and that you have to recycle the rest so there will be more room for new stuff that she can find over the summer. then, if she agrees to that and does that, help her find things that aren't so pointless. have her find flowers that mean a lot or something, cuz those you can dry and would look pretty. she'll grow out of this soon, trust me. my bro was the same way til he was about 13, but he'll learn. just make it a game and do it with her, maybe find some old junk of yours that you can throw away too so she doesn't feel like it's just her doing it. maybe explain what you're doing to your brother also, and ask him to help. just try explaining it, and ask him to let you try this and say you're trying to be adult about it and find a compromise
vQmO3N6Raa	wow that story entertained me =]<br>  but the b**** deserved it....i'd do the same thing, but you most likely won't get caught....but you might want to delete this question, cops can find evidence ANYWHERE.....you should'nt have posted it in the first place, that's a real good way of getting caught is posting it on the internet. =/<br>  <br>  but they can't get fingerprints cuz you were wearing gloves, and alot of clothing. if the cops ask you, just say you've never even seen her car before or something. just make the answer kind brief, and don't be all trembly or jittery. trust me, that's what got me caught -not going to state why- was because i was all freaking out. just stay CALM. and just brush it off, DO NOT TELL ANYONE.!!!! <br>  <br>  and i mean NOWONE, there are so many narks out there.|`|AA10684513	You should grow up first.  Second if this really happened you will get caught because I am sure you aren't that smart.|`|998f97d6c0bce2ae3b29f27253234babaa	Turn yourself in and do the right thing.|`|YM1zhtKEaa	This is the police We know where you are and where you live so come out and give up|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Considering she's driving underage don't worry about it. They'll probably just by her a new car. Cops are too busy to worry about this kind of BS. What she did is wrong, 2 wrongs don't make a right though. Your young and still learning. Stay out of major trouble though like going to jail or prison. I suggest changing your screen name, and names remain anonymous. Kids will be kids. Move on, if you get caught oh well.|`|99d179cad0d60a03f1af7a485bea7b80aa	You will get busted purely because you are stupid enough to post a criminal act on a website  where it can be traced.  Your IP address is traceable and the email account that you used to sign in is also traceable.<br>  <br>  Going forward, don't ever do anything like this again.  Someone could have gotten killed.  <br>  <br>  Finally, the car isn't destroyed.  Its just sitting in the ditch where you and your silly friend left it.  Fireworks will not do a thing to destroy the evidence.<br>  <br>  Also deleting the questions off your profile will not help you.  Its has been posted on a webserver and unless you are the administrator of the server there is no way to completely remove it.|`|EDY8mmbKaa	You will get caught... in this world there is no lies you can keep forever. turn your self in is better than being caught, if you turn your self in it may be a softer consequence. Besides if jane actually put drugs in your drink, tell the police and let them investagate. You will need to find that out because you dont know wat else she might do to you next time...|`|uJ9waJDYaa	Do not do any more damage to the car! Im pretty sure fireworks would do that, If you had gloves on there shudnt be any or not mant finger prints. Leave the car there and Do not go back. They will probably find it and just be happy they know where it is, then they will repait it or get her a new one. They won't worry about it as long as it turns up again.<br>  <br>  Now after reading this you should delete the questions and your profile and don't steal cars or do anything like this again|`|aGOBuJtKaa	Well you just typed a confession on the internet so yes you will be caught, and you will be prosecuted for theft and destruction of property.

I can imagine your anger!<br>  I think you should not be the first to talk about it. He will tell you, but it may be it's not an important relationship for him, in that case he will not say anything.|`|P5PkfDiBaa	why are you still with him???|`|44Sj3bsZaa	Confront him and dump him! Don't try to salvage the relationship.. he obviously has problems and you need to take your dignity and get outta this bad relationship. I was in the same situation and let my then boyfriend convince me that they were just friendly chatting... he proceeded to continue cheating on me for the next 4 years.... 4 years of my life, wasted on some jerk that didn't deserve me.|`|SL3BFDjHaa	I would break it off. He will deny it, but if u r confident then u should break up with him. I mean, do u really want a boyfriend who lies and cheats on u??? A BF is supposed to be loving and caring, and that is not!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Sorry for being so harsh, but I feel very strongly about cheatin over the internet, phones and stuff like that...|`|Ukw1JUNcaa	You should confront him. Perhaps he doesn't think it's "real" dating, and it was okay of him to do. Make that clear that it is definitely NOT okay and (well, I would do this anyway) dump him. Tell him you hope he keeps that in mind with his next girlfriend. And don't blame this Ashley chick too much--she might not even have known you existed.|`|AA11982696	Ok first of all think about what you just said. "online dating". Its lame and fake.  But I think you should end it with him because he shouldnt be camming or messaging any other girl like that besides you. <br>  <br>  Just tell him "I know what you did". If he denies it, break up with him. Even if he doesnt deny it, it was still wrong and you deserve an explanation why he made a stupid move.|`|fF9uTSmpaa	um yah. ? dating is dating even if its online. yu have to talk to him about it. yu cant jus date girls while yu go out. dump him and tell him yu found out and that yu guys are done. its cheating and yu rele cant trust him anymore|`|yeG5DZRAaa	How can you date and love and break up over the internet. All you people who are falling in love with cyber relationships are really out there. You can't date or fall in love over electronic transmissions.|`|EqmklxLqaa	That’s strange.  I never thought the internet was real.  Are all you Yahoo guys and girls real?

You should let him know how you feel or maybe wait a while and see if he tells you about it.|`|8QED2yn2aa	maybe he was just trying 2 start some drama, im a guy so i know, and seriusly, he might be nerd cuzz who the hell dates online when they have a gf in reel ife!!??|`|AorhZF06aa	wtf? flippin dump the cheater. hes a ahole!!!|`|PTshTOSUaa	tell him you found out hes a loser who dates cyber chicks who he doesnt even see in person. wow what a dork.|`|ZgSnFHYYaa	First you have to be 100% sure he is cheating get some evidence. Then don’t tell him you know and approach him, ask him if he is cheating. If he tells the truth you might have a chance in fixing your relationship. If he lies then you can tell him you know and present the evidence. <br>  You have to be true to your self if he is cheating you don’t have to stand for it. No one has the right to make you feel hurt so be strong and do what you have to do and make things right for your self. Don’t worry about him if he is cheating on you, he will just continuously hurt you if you don’t put a stop to it now. You are and deserve better then that so look after your needs and take charge of your life. Good luck and live life to the fullest.|`|NPhPvV85aa	First of all, talk to him. The worst he could tell you is that it's true. You can't always trust people, so just go strait to the source. If he doesn't say anything or you don't feel right talking to him about it then just ask this girl ashley. Do it before you make any decisions|`|ZgMARJvdaa	listen lil pimpin if he chats with her over a webcam c'mon lets get real he CHEATING i know ive done it DUMP HIS *** period <br>  have fun NEXT!!!!!!|`|FmhUZLgoaa	You need to confront him about it if it bothers you, if it doesn't then I guess I would act like you know nothing. But either way he did cheat on you and I would kick him right to the curb!|`|0bGDcN0Iaa	dating over the internet is for loserz!!!|`|RvSHQtrXaa	Move on with your life.  If he is cheating this way, soon he will cheat you more physically, by having a girl on the outside.  But, from you sense this kind of wildness be careful, and use a condom if you have sex or chase him away.  There are decent and fun loving guys around.  <br>  <br>  Some guys are out there dying to get a wonderful woman.  Please do not push this any how, or you will end up this way with a man cheating again.  Live your life without looking and God who created man will make the right partner of your choice.  Good luck.|`|TirUIOc3aa	haha thats funnnyyyy.<br>  <br>  dump him..|`|Un9CElCaaa	dump him and if he asks why just say "Ashley" and walk away|`|ntcETBTQaa	tell him you have been having cyber sex with his best friend! Thatll teach him@|`|1acc6a03dc8acb93ccd9b56b409139d2aa	why on earth anyone would get "emotional' over someone dating online is beyond me.. there was NO PHYSICAL CONTACT lol.. whats to get worked up about.. guys talk to chicks all the time.. i would be more worried if he were dating a girl in person, kissing her and all that.. but online psshh the most they can do is talk dirty to eachother.. i know its still wrong but its not as big of a deal as you make it. And yes confront your boyfriend about the situation, talk to him and tell him interent dating is LAME especially since you have a girl right infront of you staring you in the face.. maybe you guys are missing the communication part of your relationship and him talking to a girl online is just his way of venting out the fact that his communication with you sucks.. so find out the root of the problem then you guys can work at it..

Most girls don't kiss guys they don't like. She may be a little iffy about dating you because of you're age, a lot of girls don't date younger guys just because they think that it makes them seem immature, I say just talk to her about it, because I think you really have a chance.|`|puYGVftaaa	she defiantly likes you. for some reason some girls like to make their crush jealous, so i think she's doing this when she talks about the age thing. you've just perfectly proved to yourself by what she does she likes you. :) & you can't look like an idiot if you make a move now, as all the signals are saying yes!|`|sYkuENiHaa	Does she only do it in public (the touching, cuddling, etc) or also when it is just the two of you?  If she does it when it is just you two, then go in for a kiss and see how she reacts.  If she never does it when you are alone, then she might not mean anything by it other than being friendly.  If you two are never alone together, you need to arrange a situation where that can happen, ask her to a movie or something (prime spot for cuddles and kisses).<br>  Also consider that she might really like you but feel you are a bit young for her, this she should be able to overcome if the attraction is mutual - again, test it with a (real) kiss.<br>  Good luck.
CN6szTrZaa	Well it all depends. You can't date someone you cant bear to look at, so if he's that bad (which I doubt) then I wouldn't bother. Noah seems kind of like a player, takes what he wants and then leaves the rest. If I were in your situation(which would require a lot of money and complicated surgery) I would probably take Joe. Can't judge a book by it's cover after all.|`|5FogPrZaaa	Aw, I think you should give Joe a chance. Noah won't have a hard time moving on.|`|wsvkYamfaa	chose neither cause one is ugly and the other is a player!find someone different!!|`|SKjHbHDFaa	Haha, I've been in that situation before..<br>  Consider this: could you date someone who isn't very attractive?<br>  OR<br>  could you date someone who has been heard of being a "manwhore"?<br>  <br>  Trust is key in relationships, and if you're scared that Noah will be unfaithful, then you really can't just date him because he was cuter, you know?<br>  <br>  Unattractive boys are not so bad, I have found that I've been treated way better by the nice boys who weren't so good looking. It's good to be treated like a princess.<br>  <br>  Don't base your relationship mainly on looks, it can really kick back at you in the end.|`|0bGDcN0Iaa	date me<br>  <soccer12nb@yahoo.com>|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Be friends with Joe, maybe he will grow on you and leave Noah to the other ladies.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	um....joe probs. i mean he is nice n funny.he isnt ugly (wat i get frum it) but not as atractive as noah. but noah had sex n if he is a manwhore he mite try 2 push u 2 do sex. i think joe bcus noah cud jus want sex. then again ppl mite b lyin. but if u kno joe is nice he mite the more respectful..chose joe<br>  <br>  <br>  gud luck<br>  <br>  which eva 1 u get 2 kno and love/lyk more<br>  <br>  get 2 kno em both. it should help|`|fb5d7O6Saa	The truth is.. The real attractive ones are most times are the fast ones. Not in all cases. However, you may want to look at the fact that it is hear say. Do you know his reputation for certain? If you feel that this is true then you may want to reconsider Joe. He sounds like a winner.|`|5c6F8ogkaa	when it comes down to it whose gonna treat u best? the guy with the great personalitly or the guy who sleeps with everyone?|`|FzFSzilmaa	have both, and enjoy... :D

However, if the “qualifying person” is your dependent parent, he or she does not have to live with you. <br>  <br>  According to the IRS, there can only be one head of household.|`|fbOnyxdyaa	Yes if one of you want to go to jail for tax fraud,Unless your both head of your own household.

Typically this only happens with very skinny people.  They get a size 16 pair of jeans and they each get into a leg when the IRS comes to audit.  Then in unison they chant "hello, I'm the head of the household, I wear the pants around here".|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Wouldn't that defeat the purpose of "head" of household?

vwOcFXgcaa	As a 32 year old with two kids who has been married for 13 years and has two combat tours to Iraq. . . . Myspace is just a website. Seriously, can you imagine growing up without Myspace? I did and do you know how I found out who my friends were? They were the ones who stood by me and supported me through tough times. <br>    I myself have a myspace and my #1 person is my daughter. A judge can easily say that my wife is no longer my wife, but no one to include God himself can EVER tell me that my daughter is not mine. So, are YOU being the best person you can to your friend? Does she do what she can for you? She confides in you, so her #1 on Myspace could be anyone, because its just a website. It is her heart that lets you know who here TRUE #1 is. <br>  <br>      Best of luck to you and think about what us old people did before Myspace and Youtube and Nintendo and. . . alright, I'll stop.|`|TBiQ1CGVaa	Umm, its only a space on myspace. It's really not that big of a deal. How do you know she doesn't feel the same about you that you feel about her? If you're basing this and are upset just because of a silly friend slot on myspace, you really need to get a life. I'm not trying to be mean at all, just being honest. People can and do have two best friends. Sometimes friends make each other cry unintentionally, but it is possible to move on and get over it. You really don't need to throw away a great friendship just because you aren't number one on her myspace. Grow up.|`|jK8xy3VUaa	You should still be her friend. Maybe she doesn't realize all the good you are doing for her. Even though you may not be on her top friends list, you're still her friend. Maybe she just hasn't upgraded the list, or maybe she just has a bond with the other person. Like I said, you should still be her friend. Hope this helps :)|`|cDjWONryaa	Actually this is a question that you can see right thru.  This girl is selfish and uncaring.  You are caring and sympathetic.  At some point maybe even viewed a pathetic.  I mean to be so concerned over someone not putting you on their myspace top friends is SILLY!<br>  And then for you to put her as your HERO is even more SILLY!<br>  You should have bigger goals for a HERO.. I mean if she is as mean and uncaring as you say that she is why would you want her to be your HERO that would mean that you look up to her.<br>  <br>  I say move on and find someone who will return the favors and quit being her PANZY!

lIpjuMTHaa	Well its on his right hand so I'm sure it isn't a wedding band unless he is from a country where the marriage hand is the right hand. If it fits him properly on his right then it most likely doesn't fit him properly on his left. I'm sure he would put it in his pocket rather than put it on the other hand.

RGcXgjEDaa	You are at the age now where if there was a custody hearing they would ask you where you want to live.  Your father would have to contest the current situation for this to happen.  From what you say there is no reason why they wouldn't allow you to live with your dad, firefighter or not, he has a stable well paying job, a place for you to live and someone there with him to help. <br>  <br>  Have you tried talking to your mom about this?  Sit her down and talk to her serious and tell her you want to live with your dad, or even suggest a temporary thing.  Something where maybe you stay with him in the summer or the rest of the school year.  If you like it you stay if not you go back home to mom.  If she is telling you that it is because your dad doesn't want you at his house sit them both down together, she will not be able to lie if he is there. <br>  <br>  I do just want to say though, don't think that moving to your dad's will make everything better.  I am not sure of your exact situation but just remember everyone has problems and nothing is perfect.  They do not have the saying the grass is always greener on the other side for a reason.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!|`|R6TFrDtxaa	If it is truly as bad as you say then call your Human resoures dept. and tell them.

If your half-siblings who live with your dad are doing well, this will bolster your case.<br>  <br>  You would do well to avoid having "kiddish" reasons for wanting to move.  Judges don't care if you don't want to move to a new city and will lose your friends; though, if you've moved multiple times within a short period of time necessitating school changes, this is a strong argument for you.  They will also not consider getting yelled at abuse or even a spanking, so long as you're not carrying bruises around.  Simply not getting on well with your mom and step-dad just means that you're a teenager; it doesn't establish good cause to amend a custody agreement.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to find a solid reason to live with your dad.  Courts love it when kids are worried about their education or if they're wanting to switch homes to give them better educational or economic opportunities.  These have to be serious and you need to carry them out.<br>  <br>  If your mom is specifically banning you from talking to your dad while you're grounded, this is worth mentioning to a judge.  However, if he could talk to you via house phone or on your mom's cell phone or something, it's not even worth a mention.  Judges support good discipline.  If you're not working up to your potential at school, a grounding is warranted.<br>  <br>  A judge will also listen to a counselor who is speaking on your behalf.  If you're feeling unhappy at home, you should consider speaking to a counselor at school.  You shouldn't use this as a strategy to manipulate your parents or a judge.  You should see the counselor to help you learn better strategies to cope with your home life.  If you're open and honest with your counselor and genuinely try the techniques she/he suggest, you may find yourself feeling happier at home.  If the problem can't be solved by this method, the counselor will definitely back you up in court when you ask to live with your dad.  Judges are very interested in what counselors have to say and would most likely act in accordance with their opinion.  Of course, best case scenario, you don't even have to go to court because you all learn to get along better.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|hQmZP38qaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I believe that every state may have this law, but when you turn thirteen years old, you have the right to tell the judge who you want to live with and the reasons behind your answer.  It is called the Emancipation Law.  You can go to google and find out more information on this law.<br>  <br>  If your mother is abusing you, you need to get some help for not only yourself but for your mother.  The courts can actually take you away from her because of the abuse.<br>  <br>  I use to be abused as a child by my mother, I just didn't know any better back then.  If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't of let it happen to me.<br>  <br>  You read the information and stick with that, regardless of what job your father is doing, you have the right to say who you want to live with and why.  Just let the judge know the truth behind your decision.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you out, and have a great weekend.|`|DCwGQDO9aa	In most states you can chose who you want to live with under responsible cause.  Now, if you were put into danger because of the parent the court would have the final say.|`|AA10029021	In MO the age to choose is around 13. I am not sure of SC, but there is allott of good advice on here for you. I am happy you realize that an abusive household is not a good place to be. Talk to a judge, teacher, church leader for support. It sounds like your dad and stepmom will be there for you too. Good luck.|`|ilx6DeVYaa	yes, your father has every right to have custody. especially once you turn 16, the courts will listen very closely to what you say, too. if you want to move with your dad, then you can voice that and if you tell the courts what you just wrote, then that would be enough for your dad to get you. if he has a stable home and other children who are happy and doing well, and you're not happy with your mom, then you can tell a judge that and he/she will take that very seriously. i think you should try and go with your dad. i would if i were you|`|4HoVVCenaa	The courts make a decision based on what is best for the child based on evidence presented. Start by documenting any incidence of abuse. Who, what, where, when, why.... and witnesses if any. Give it to your dad and ask him to get a custody hearing scheduled.|`|bO2rzfISaa	At your age the judge will ask you (privately) where YOU want to be. Tell him/her what you've said here.<br>  <br>  Your mom is wrong. He could easily get custody. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.<br>  <br>  Also: your mom should NEVER ground you from communicating with your dad. That is wrong on so many levels.<br>  <br>  EDIT: There's no test for bipolar (I have it) though there is a screening test done in writing. I think you've been fed a line. Don't give up on therapy because of that. Get another therapist.
8FbOtXAXaa	Only if you feel like it. It kind of sounds like she is not very appreciative of your gestures like getting her something for your birthday and I know you said you don't care if you get a present, but I do think you care if she is thinking of you on your birthday. Maybe just get her a card if you want to. No harm in that. That way you don't have to splurge on her and feel like maybe you shouldn't have gotten her something in the first place.|`|vELJqdQAaa	like you said, it will be on her mind if she hasn't bought you a present. But if shes a good friend other wise, I'd go ahead and buy her something. The past is the past and you two are friends, no need to ruin the friendship over presents.|`|4b7598fb11241e3ead2dd43bfb020adcaa	Hmm I think you should and see what happens. I mean at the time when it was your birthday, even if she got new shoes maybe she didn't have the money at the time.|`|EvoRPcnTaa	hell yea|`|2JJLYSAKaa	No. absolutely not.  Then you will be writing that you got her a present 2 years in a row and you got nothing.<br>  <br>  Get her a card.  Put a candle in a cupcake.   NO PRESENT
MeNoa6PWaa	well, if you are anything like me, then you dont talk when you are uncomfortable or are around people you dont know. i am extremely quiet. but once i become comfortable around others i can become pretty talkative. maybe thats your problem. just try and slowly edge your way into the conversation until your not afraid of what to say. i hope that helps.|`|FeZR63f8aa	I'm pretty quiet myself, but over the last two years, I've been working on talking more.<br>  I hear you can check out social skills books from the library, and I have a workbook I bought for improving social skills.  <br>  If it isn't that you're troubled socially, but just shy or keeping your mouth shut (that's pretty wise, sometimes, depending on personality), then there's not much of a problem.  If that is the case, then you need friends and relationships with people that are not going to be bothered by your personality, if that's just how you are.<br>  <br>  It takes a lot of work and practice to talk more with meaning, and I personally still have a long way to go, but I'm making more friends and I'm increasingly more comfortable.<br>  <br>  If the not talking comes from anxiety, you could need to treat that.<br>  <br>  It really depends on what your not talking is about.  I'd need more information.  If you'd like to further discuss it, you can message me.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	just focus more on them and what they say, don't be afraid to ask them questions such as "how was your weekend, I like your shirt, where did you get that from", what did you think of the teacher. sounds like you are just shy. try to join some interest groups outside of school to get yourself more socialized and open. this will also give you some confidence along with something to talk about.|`|56n8oUvjaa	Open your mouth, make comments. It might be weird at first, and they might act weird as well because it will be a change for the group (you talking) but it's really not as hard. Just try and get with the program, or else you'll be like me, no friends at age 20 lol|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	tell them you're not very good at starting conversations. My friend tells me I dont talk much, but when I do start talking, he complains i talk too much. Ask if there is a specific amount of talking you should be aware of.|`|22621f93a7534ed2f1a71acf45cf11a4aa	open ur mouth and say words. simple as that. =)|`|p73oMCV8aa	Just say want you want|`|8FbOtXAXaa	First of all it just sounds like you are a little shy and there is nothing wrong with that. Every one is different in their own way. Some people are really loud and some people are really quiet and reserved and that's fine. Maybe you feel uncomfortable around these friends and so it is hard for you to talk or speak up so if they aren't really close friends you could always start hanging out with people that you think you would be more comfortable with. And if you want to still hang out with them just be yourself. Your friends should love you no matter how quiet you are.|`|VV7bpOXuaa	Aww, you sound just like my best friend!<br>  But when I'm with her, I try and get her talking and then she can be louder than me once I've started her off lol. Honestly, learn to grow your confidence. Just think of topics, and when things start to get awkward, just try to come up with something. Or just ask them a question. Even if it's about the work or something. Just gradually build yourself and your confidence up. I have noticed a massive difference in my best friends confidence throughout the past couple of years. Honestly, you will get louder and more talkative in time. When i was like 11 I was just the same. But since I have met new people, I am not half as quiet as I used to be. But don't forget that it is just who you are. You don't have to get so confident that you are completely "out there". Just confident enough to be able to hold a conversation without any awkward moments.<br>  Good luck!|`|Qqz4E852aa	well if your shy around friends it means your not comfortable so maybe start a small converstaion like <br>  hey <br>  watz up<br>  and just sort of add as you go on, I am also like you i get nerouv then shy around  people and i  going to high school soon and i worred about making new freinds i'm very friendly but nervoyus aoound crowds lool hope you can get talking. Also thoes people who say just open your mouth som poeople just freeze and can't take hwen there shy so shut up|`|vELJqdQAaa	I'm quite a shy person myself. If your really close to your friends talking to them should come at an ease, even if your shy. But it's alright, if they are real friends they'll respect you if you say little or a lot of things.<br>  Its up to you to say what you want to say to someone.|`|sX7N7xnfaa	try to find common interests or they'll start to think that your boring talk to them like i watched this on tv last night do u like this show try to find some common ground to talk about and you should be good to go (:|`|9iOxl6epaa	i always listen too some rap music or something that gets me pumped if im feeling especially quiet. but if your friends are turned off by that in you then there not reall friends.|`|EvoRPcnTaa	stacker 3|`|AorhZF06aa	open your mouth, say words, lots of times|`|x8VSJx8Daa	Well sometimes the problem is u dont KNOW what to say without sounding lame. So invent an inside joke with them so u can all laugh and joke and u will come out of your shell. Also try joining CHeerleading! That helped me be more confident about myself and talk more. Everyone said so! Life changer! <br>         Even just saying during math<br>  "Wait i dont get it! Ughh, this is so hardd. haha."<br>  Can make u seem like u talk more. <br>  And be like "heyy babe (or girl.)" to your friends. And raise your hand more in class. and just be open to talk to a lot of ppl even by saying <br>  soo whats new..? <br>  And def. say " OMG!" a lot. And "OMG i love your shirtt so much! Where did u get it?" WIth a smile. Always talk with a smile. !! . <br>  I def. recommend u joining CHeerleading. u may be like<br>  HECK NO. but it helps SOO MUCH.

Just practice listening to them and then respond after thinking about what you're going to say. Your skills will improve but don't feel bad about being reserved either.

Uj5kuzoJaa	DON'T DO IT!!! Apparently she's not a real friend if you are trying to take her boyfriend from her. You should tell her that you like him and see what happens. Don't just sleep with her boyfriend. He probably doesn't even like you and just wants to get some EASY booty|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Stay away from him!<br>  <br>  Do you want to be the cause of your friend breaking up?  Karma has a way of dealing with people who do things like that.  My ex cheated on me and 14 years later she was killed in a car wreck.  So if you want to tempt fate then go for it but a sane person would leave it alone.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|gOJULd63aa	just do it.|`|9PlDaDzuaa	The fact that you are even considering it I think gives everyone reading this that you are not a very good friend. It is too bad that the young women you are talking about not only has a boyfriend such as she does, but it is to bad that she also has a horrible friend such as yourself. The answer should be easy, and I think that you must know what the right answer is or you wouldn't have posted the question with the hopes that some idiot here would tell you that it is somehow okay that you want to betray your friend. You should NOT have sex with him and then tell your friend that he asked you too.|`|7uGMyGn2aa	yeah dont do it.

The problem with being young is you are stuck in an area or school surrounded by people that if you had the choise you prob wouldnt hang around with. as soon as you are 18 and have all the freedom in the world you can socialise with who ever you want not with who happens to be on your door step!<br>  <br>  You probably dont fancy boys at the moments becasue there is no one decent to fancy. You should be proud to have high standards!<br>  <br>  Not wearing make up doesnt mean anything hun. If anything you prob have more self confidence than the girls that slap it on with spade.

Why not yours if he wont?  men feel helpless if theyre not working or working to their full potential. but one or both must be willing to make concessions to save their marriage if hats truly what they want. i wuld say the lesser of the two jobs should give in here but jobs are very scarce today and are very much needed in todays society so your marriage needs to be saved but at what cost? Good luck|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	This is a prob for my hub and I. We both work TONS but he does moreso. It is pretty much most of his life. Even when we have alone time, his phone is constantly ringing or he's making calls. <br>  It pains me and have told him before we need to work on this because I feel our relationship isn't getting the time it needs.<br>  Talk to your hub and please do not take your relationship for granted. <br>  It also needs love and attention so that it can grow (just like a job).|`|78J2Q1gMaa	i would ask myself what was more important to me..my marriage or my job.
ZH4N6Xdtaa	who cares really, I feel sadness for her situation, but people are going on like she is a national treasure or something... she is marrying a guy who is currently out on bail for beating up a 16 year old with a golf club and she has openly admitted she is only getting married for the magazine deals.. she is hardly princess diana is she?<br>  <br>  I would not be bothered if my wedding day was on the same day.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	no. If you search you can find something bad on ANY day. Besides I think Jade's wedding is very sweet and not a bad thing at all.(even if the situation surrounding it is).<br>  <br>  I don't think anyone's wedding is going to be overshadowed by someone they don't know.  I mean celebrities get married all the time and it's always a huge deal to the media but that doesn't prevent other people from getting married that day.<br>  I think the less than intelligent one here is the one asking the question.|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Why would I?<br>  <br>  I don't know her and neither will my guests, they will be at my wedding for me.<br>  She is in a completely different country so it isn't like she will be at the same venue.<br>  I didn't even know she was getting married mostly because she is a B grade (at best) celebrity and I don't care. <br>  She may be dieing and her man may be on parole, so circumstances are a little different, but there is no possible way this can impact on my life except for maybe a tiny page 23 article in the newspaper next week.<br>  <br>  How can you think it would impact on any bride? We don't plan our weddings around random strangers.|`|pMsMx817aa	:S<br>  who?<br>  <br>  edit -- jeez... sorry but my life doesnt revolve around celebrities, i have my own life and my own wedding.  if i want my wedding on a sunday it will be on a damn sunday.  shes no different than anyone else in my books|`|pub2GLZPaa	there are only 7 days in a week, and throughout history something bad has happened on each of those days, multiple times, throughout the generations.<br>  <br>  I'm getting married on Sunday and I don't care about anyone's events/circumstances or what may have happened. I mean, I probably wouldn't pick the biggies like rememberance/memorial day, or Sept 11 or something.... but everything else....who cares?|`|b1xQKDEraa	unless your a celebrity how would your day be over shadowed by Jade Goody? you will still have the guests you invited attend and will be the centre of attention to the people that matter most to you. I dont know many people who have their weddings put into magazines so Im sure they wont really care.|`|kykmpr0Caa	not really, because afterall their big day was booked ages in advance to jades big day. unless of course it was in the place next door then it might be overshadowed , but your guesta would be there for you really!! <br>  <br>  my wedding day was on the same day england won the rugby world cup 22 november 2003, all the men at my reception were in the hotel lounge watching it on the big screen, i was p***** off buthey what can you do?<br>  <br>  <br>  SO.. to anyone getting married this weekend  - have a wonderful day , hope the weather is fine for you|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	I don't think anyone would feel overshadowed. Jade Goody is very popular, and this is a very sad time in her life, but that doesn't mean any bride will feel less special.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Who cares about Jade Goody? I dont know who she is, niether do I care.|`|QFCYfJ0caa	yup and yup|`|ziS5xMkEaa	No what a stupid Question|`|4POGapREaa	I know who she is & I know what her situation is but I'm not obsessed with celebrities or death & wouldn't feel that's a bad omen for me.  She's a person in a very unfortunate situation & she's getting married.  Good for her.  It has nothing to do with my life or my marriage.  Weird question.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	This will not be the case for anyone in America. If you asked 100 Americans who Jade Goody is, my guess is that about 3 of them would be able to answer you. The others might say, "Isn't she that woman who researched gorillas?" (Jane Goodall). And even the three who know who she is could care less about her wedding, although I'm sure they have some sympathy for her illness.<br>  <br>  Is it a bigger deal in Britain?
2qw6E7iCaa	yes- its probably the most romantic setting. coz everyone knows what will happen next, you know- you drive back to house.... make a u-turn into the woods side and have sex on the back seat...<br>  <br>  by the way i am joking its really not like that but- i would like to be a best answer???|`|wEOxsinvaa	Well the films always have it too cheesy! When me and my other half went to New York, both of us hadn't seen any of the great sights or city views, and it was really nice seeing them together.<br>  <br>  When we started going out, he realised I like to star gaze (Not celebrities, actually stars in the sky!), and we went for a drive one night and he brought me to this place, away from all the lights from houses and the town. I could have stayed there all night, it was fantastic. Couldn't even count the stars if I tried to!|`|tEshdOxtaa	yes..... but a starry sky is even better|`|Xyma3z7Jaa	Not all girls feel the same....honestly you could take me outside to the park at night to show me the harvest moon and I would go OH MY<br>  !!!! but showing me city lights is not all that spectacular...<br>  <br>  <br>  I would assume that most females might like it but not all.|`|GiQ2Ov1kaa	Most young girls do i know i do but if they seen the city view they will get used to it and get bored with it, so only do it one time.|`|cxzQVRYiaa	Some girls probably like a city at night view, but I wouldn't base my whole 'pulling birds' technique on some hackneyed old movie cliché.|`|5yDeFpVQaa	personally i love to go to down town at night<br>  i like how there's a bunch of light it looks awsome!!<br>  <br>  i love it...|`|QpRihtQ6aa	haha personally i luv them. most girls do.|`|tmfhieP7aa	I would love that :)|`|ahujYDBdaa	YEAH BOY, WOMEN LOVE IT!|`|YlS8gnCiaa	personally I love that , i love any beautiful view I can lose myself in<br>  <br>  but others might not|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	yes we do|`|VP7KAe12aa	I wouldn't like it at all. I mean I would personally like it if when he says "I wanna show you something" and takes me to a field and we look at the stars. I wouldn't mind that at all. I wouldn't be so thrilled to see city lights. I mean you see those all the time. You can't really see the stars anymore.<br>  Rebekka|`|eDP3YU5Laa	i love that!|`|dPULl5hjaa	Watching too many movies!|`|Tf19RETiaa	sometimes =)|`|bkgBLjuvaa	I love it. =]|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	I prefer a sunset by the lake:-)|`|uec7RIhbaa	haha i dunno, i'm a country bumpkin!  some guy takes me to the top of a hill round here and all we can see is the full beam lights of a tractor ploughing or the floodlights of some horse riders outdoor school.... i wouldn't mind a twinkly light city-scape once in a while!!! haha|`|3ijLQe5laa	yes|`|fYAjV0GGaa	sterotype. But some girls to happen to find it beautiful.|`|kiJUCYMcaa	yeah i kinda like it, the whole beutiful view, but it has never happened to me though but yeah like veiws and stuff|`|AA11052660	i think it depends on the person.  i LOVE city lights.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	i personally love it. hahah|`|TadINnYoaa	I once spent $770 australian just for a balcony suite to take a really beautiful korean hostess to in a top class city hotel for one night.<br>  With her fees on top plus food and drinks etc. it was a high profile event for an ordinary joe like me.<br>  But man she loved it and the whole thing was worth every cent !|`|TbapRrYGaa	nt rly naw :D|`|OCTvfDsxaa	A guy I dated tried to be "romantic" like that for me once but to be honest,the view wasn't that great. In the end, it was his attempt to be original that got my attention. But I think it mostly depends on what type of view the girl wants to see. She may be into more of a nature setting.|`|AorhZF06aa	cute  :D|`|P8xN2IzIaa	No, I like the woods and to see the view of a million stars, instead of the 4 I can see in the city substituted with lights of houses and buildings.|`|0KgrjTgtaa	I love it.<br>  But also a beach, or a park, or a lake, or a forest..<br>  It's generally the whole romantic feel and the fact that the guy has thought about taking her somewhere and stuff like that.|`|F2gYMVQXaa	im a guy and i like it|`|J7k4xJtoaa	Girls do like it, but they are going to think you are trying to get into their pants because thats basically why they do it in the movies. Just have a better reason.|`|FJXWanpAaa	I would LOVE that lol.<br>  I love the night lights shining on the water and the view of the top of the city. AMAZING|`|dJoE8yedaa	Definitely. I do...|`|j7HeuFeVaa	Lol! Personally i prefer the sunset or moon & stars at night<br>  I'd definetly suggest doing it for a girl though :)|`|DxYwNFdhaa	Depends on the girl I think !!! I personally do.  If the gilr is a romantic then its perfect =)|`|QXoeJqD8aa	Yea....but if it too hard to go see a city views then i suggest, sunset at the beach lake|`|0q5Z5zxIaa	yeah we do! .. it's because it's so romantic.<br>  <br>  :)|`|XTj0LP6gaa	It depends on the girl|`|hXnxqzH9aa	O.k. I'm not real sure what you're asking can you be more specific.

Eug52iQDaa	Oh sweetie!  The first time, your dad left your MOM.  It had nothing to do with you.  Each time he left he went TO someone; he wasn't running away from you.  He's a man with no sense of responsibility or family, really.   He is an extraordinarily immature human being.  Saddest of all, he has no clue what he's missing! <br>  <br>  That you know how very lucky you are to have such a wonderful family shows that you're a very mature young lady.  <br>  <br>  Your bio father is an acquaintance - sperm donor, no more.  Treat him the way you would anyone that comes in and out of your life.  Don't expect anything from him; only give what you feel comfortable giving.  If you don't want to see him, don't.  As hard as it is, let the anger go.   You know what it takes to make a baby.  It takes a real man to be a father, and you have one!<br>  <br>  Look around at your real family and then ask what you're missing.  Anything?  :)   You have your answers right there, honey.  <br>  <br>  You need to forgive an immature, childish man that donated sperm to conceive you.  You can't lose something you never had - a relationship with him.<br>  <br>  Give your real daddy a big hug.  You are SO lucky!!!|`|W2z5dCrmaa	Ok Dallas<br>  <br>  There are people who are damaged for and by what ever reason, and Jeff turns out to be one of those people. I don't excuse him, and you don't need to either. I'm just helping you to understand a little bit better.<br>  <br>  Damaged shows up in a number of ways and one of the ways that it can show up is in the not being able to have normal strong feelings and bonding to an adult relationship. You weren't an adult, but rather a child caught in the middle of two adults. Your mom being healthy, and your bio father who wasn't able to bond with caring into an adult relationship.<br>  <br>  It would be a good idea for you to forgive him as damaged goods, for your benefit and not his, but  remember too that he is damaged goods if he tries to establish relationship in your life, and keep that in mind in setting the extent to which you allow him in. <br>  <br>  If you don't do forgiveness, it eats away at you, not him.<br>  <br>  Wanting the best for you<br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|mbvpWNMeaa	Don't hold on to anger in your heart which hurts no one but you.  In that sense forgive him.  That doesn't mean you have to make room for him in your life if you don't want to.|`|szH3qJ7Iaa	forget about him. he will only hurt you, has he has again and again.|`|LC3TGSr3aa	It's completely your choice. <br>  <br>  Though, if it were me, I would forget about him. I have tolerance for people leaveing me. And if he did it two times then he should have known that he doesn't deserve to be in your life.|`|RGcXgjEDaa	Seems like your happy with your life now, forgive him and forget him for now.  Maybe when you are older and have kids of your own you can try again but not now, teen years can be crazy enough as they are no need to make it worse|`|5t5oYIC8aa	forgive, but dont forget|`|W0633l18aa	I would say you don't need him and you are happy without him so only let him back in if you want to get to know him<br>  <br>  he is your father so it may be worthwhile trying to understand why he has acted like he did to give you closure you may need, many people are also interested in who are their biological parents so gettign to nkow him may be helpful to oyu<br>  <br>  but if you do let him back in and manage to forgive him tread carefully, he may walk out again so be careful you odn;t let him in too far<br>  <br>  gd luck, in the end it is up to you and what you want to do|`|ed7803f645a13205fd2cb80b16fdc318aa	Yes, as humans we go through growth and development phases in our life. Some liken it to the seven year itch. It is some what a true statement. What you did at 3 or 5 is not as cute and does not have the meaning it had then. Your dad might be in the same situation. There will be a time you need to know your father. You need to find out his medical background. This will give you a sense of some of the illness you might have in your future. Knowing these factors, you can better prepare for a better future for you and your family. I am talking about if your father have diabetes and other forms of illness that you need to know. Also, as one get older he/she might slow down their life style and need to prepare for the inevitable. You might want to consider to be close and let him know that you are a bigger person to forgive and not to forget the lesson that he taught you about emotional hurt. Hang in there. Life has a way of smoothing out the rough roads.
mbvpWNMeaa	Your Mom wants to help her brother and it sounds like he needs the help.  He is very inconsiderate to complain about her cooking or to ask her to cook for extra people, but if he were my bother, I would probably do the same thing and just ignore his comments.  Your Mom is a good woman.|`|aRkYiXtGaa	i am afraid i would have to put him in his place, buy him the food, dump it on the doorstep and say, here you go, if you can do better than you do it, even better ask your 32yr old daughter to have a go, when they get hungry they will attempt it or phone your mom and grovel for her to do it again, and if he is obese then it wont hurt him|`|RGcXgjEDaa	If there are 2 adults in the house then someone should be able to cook.  Tell your mom to stop making them food, go food shopping drop it off then tell them here you go.  Or even better buy the frozen meals for him and ask do you like these better.  The only way he will change and be nicer about it is if your mom stops doing everything for him.  Over 4 years he has gotten used to it, it is time for your mom to cut the cord at least until he is a little bit more grateful for what she does for him.|`|f7ItbuINaa	I think your Mum needs to regain her independence and start to stand up for herself. There are other home help services available. Maybe she could start by reducing the number of times she cooks for them?  <br>  Also she could just make them batches of food for your uncle to freeze. Things like shepherds pie and lasagne are easy to put into freezable portions and then all your aunt and uncle have to do is put them in the microwave. That way she could cut the times that she cooks for him in half!<br>  Tell her she needs to stand up for herself.|`|nBQeSu2faa	Your uncle is taking advantage of you mothers generosity in a big way...sadly there is nothing you can do , if you mother is not prepared to tell him enough is enough. You could try talking to her again ...tell her maybe it's time she started to look after herself..because it seems this uncle doesn't care about her..if he did he would not treat her like this.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	Surely the 32 year old daughter should be caring for her parents-not your mother.<br>  If he is obese then he should be in some sort of programme ordered by the GP.<br>  If your uncle doesn't like what your mum does suggest he makes his own arrangements-if he is obese he really should be in a structured programme with health professionals.<br>  This is not your mothers problem-nor yours.<br>  This is a problem for the medical profession.<br>  Can't you get them assessed ?
FdixIDR1aa	Okay, you need to ste back and look at the situation. He proposed to you, that means that he loves you and wants to be with you forever. Unless he has given you a reason to suspect him, you need to just ignore the ignorant thing that this girl has said. She may be good at breaking up happy homes, but that doesnt mean your man will go for it. Dont do anything like going into his work, that just makes you look insecure and stupid.....exactly what she wants. Just calm down and let life happen. Enjoy being engaged and throw your happiness together in her face!|`|AA10106002	Don't get married 'till y'all grow up some.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	You could confront her. But if you do, that could end up embarassing your fiance, and cause problems in your relationship. Maybe just make random visits to his work, without letting him know that you are going to 'pop in'... That way you can let your presence be known , and also by popping in without giving them notice, if they are doing something you might be able to catch their behavior|`|Eug52iQDaa	There are, unfortunately, all kinds of people in this world.  You found a good man.  He told you what was going on there.  Both of you need to give her the credit she is due - NONE!  No one can make you do anything you don't want to.  Trust your fiance, and let him know you trust and love him!  Let him know that nothing that the mean busy-body does or says is going to change how you feel about him.  If you don't have that confidence in your relationship with him, you should reconsider marriage.|`|o1yy6KABaa	he asked YOU to marry him, not her. <br>  If you cant seem to realise that it means he wants YOU then I think its you who might have some self esteem issues. trust your man, theres no point getting married if you dont trust him.|`|W1aYIF71aa	Threesome.|`|GeruGGOQaa	You're not mature enough to get married.  I would recommend postponing or all out cancelling the wedding.  GROW UP!|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	I'm soooooo sick of these women who think that it's funny to screw with other people's lives. <br>  You march your happy butt down to Olive Garden in the sexiest thing you own. You find this girl and you grab her by the shirt and say listen *****, you aren't going to break up MY happy home, and if you even think about trying I'll come find you again, and next time I won't be this  nice.<br>  Then take your fiance by the shirt, tell him if he even thinks about screwing things up for a skank he will be speaking in high tones for the rest of his life.|`|LjV0MTQYaa	Trust him. It simply crossed his subconcious thoughts but he's not literally thinking of doing it. He told you of this dream and this girl, which means he's comfortable talking to you -- you should trust him.<br>  <br>  If things get worse, you can confront her to tell her to back off but I wouldn't worry about him.|`|AA11457957	I know this is troublesome but do not start trouble. She is a *****/whore who wants everyones power. I am a lot older than you. My husband wears his wedding ring to work and everyone says hi. I go there once in awhile and now he gets dirty looks from a woman he never spoke to and doesnt know her name. Another woman came to ask me if I was married to him. Just trust him!|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I think you should let him handle it.  It sounds like he's got it covered...<br>  <br>  Don't go interpreting dreams - nobody really knows the in's and out's behind them so don't going reading into it.|`|9t1taTCtaa	Keep it cool for now, You have to trust your fiance, He has been straight up with you so far so just take things calmly... Congrats|`|0KLu4hRaaa	No trust equals a bad marriage. Your call.|`|cDjWONryaa	First of all I say grow up and get on with your life.<br>  If he asked you to marry him then that is what he wanted not this chick.<br>  And second of all shame on him for coming home and telling you this, which more than likely was intentional simply to try and make you jealous. <br>  <br>  So either you trust him or you don't you have to make that choice.<br>  Worrying about something doesn't change what the outcome is.<br>  I wouldn't lower myself to her standards by being Catty or rude.  But I would make a trip in for dinner one night on his night off and make sure you engagement ring is nice and shiney!!!|`|AVDn7Imqaa	First let the ho know that you know all about her and that if she does anything you will be letting the management know all about her trying to destroy your relationship. Be nice but straight forward so there is nomisunderstandingg and let your boyfriend know what you are going to do. If he has a problem with that then I would be worried.|`|0BX8Lozkaa	Marriage is over rated, make sure he is loyal before you walk down the isle to him.|`|aUkvr0Ckaa	YOU AND BUNNY NEED GO ****** BEAT THAT BITCHES ***!!<br>  <br>  LOL

cgHDDdalaa	well define seductive....like do you want to bang him? or just flirt? touch his inner thigh.|`|tmfhieP7aa	It would depend on the guy. If you dress too revealing then they might think you are too easy and not be into that, but on the other hand some guys might like that.<br>  But I guess a lot of guys would be turned on if you put out on the first date...|`|Z2zTCqkZaa	duh tell them that you aren't feeling well then once you get home....<br>  <br>  go to the bathroom and ask them to wait for you to say good-bye then in the bathroom have the sexiest outfit (bra and undies or even sexy slutey )clothes and then pop out of the bathroom and walk really sexy and say something like " you know i am really sick so sick that i've gone bad could you maybe help me and give me a good puishment..." then pull him away to the bed room and you know what to do.
Qqz4E852aa	ok jim is an *** whole just like to say that. Your not fat your normal i say i bet jim is thinking of thoes girls in that link the hot bikini one. <br>  But if you really wanna loose weight just get running and push ups gym and stuff liek that eat low calery because is you eat low calories the nyour a forced to burn fat not calories. Because if you eat a bounch of food aand then you run your running of the food not the fat(not to put that in a mean way)<br>  But i hope you reach you goal <br>  sARAH =)|`|AA11284138	check <a href="http://yourhotbikini.com/" rel="nofollow">http://yourhotbikini.com/</a> and make it a goal.|`|Eug52iQDaa	There is no guarantee that your breasts will shrink if you lose weight.  None.  Try going to a good sporting store and finding a better sports bra for running.  If you're uncomfortable with your bra size overall, there are minimizing bras also.  I bet in a few years you won't even worry about all that.  For now, manage the jiggle while you run.  You're a healthy weight and active.  Good for you!|`|8yDWfTS8aa	Honey, you are not thin.  Your stomach really is big. <br>  <br>  You know how anorexics will look in the mirror and see a fat person?  You have that problem, but the opposite.|`|gC7OMToraa	Eat healthy and keep up with your exercises! :) Try out for a sports team at school, thats always a good way to keep in shape.|`|ESFo4rXuaa	From that picture your tummy is not flat. I would suggest eating a balanced diet but you can't just believe that though because you could lose the weight and your breasts look even bigger. Be happy with who you are and make yourself happy- at your age you should not be worrying about body issues- remember that you have many more years to go and your body is always changing so even if you try to change it might be even harder to maintain. Good luck!|`|u0eTvggDaa	Make it one of your priorities to run, and work out. Also watch what you eat.<br>  <br>  Example: It's best to snack on 5-6 little meals a day, then 3 really big meals.<br>  <br>  Remember to always stretch before running/working out.<br>  <br>  Before you go to bed, do 50 crunches/ sit-up's, next do 20 push ups.<br>  <br>  Once you get use to doing 50/20 then move it up to 100/40<br>  <br>  Make it a goal, you have to want it bad enough!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|mMOgjOQdaa	There is no guarantee that your breasts will shrink. Since you are already thin, I don't think you should try and lose weight. Instead, look into cosmetic surgery... that's about all you can do and I really don't suggest that either. Try to be happy with the way God made you. Its so hard, I know. But you are a beautiful girl, no matter how small your breasts are!
AA11295713	For starts how long have you been with him? and well if i were you sure he might be amazing but if you havent been with him long and hes pushy he could be after one thing. but if you know for a fact he's not like that then just sit down and talk to him, surely if he is that decent he will hear you out, a relationship is a two way thing, needs a bit of give and take from both sides. otherwise it just doesnt work. Trust me he will understand if hes the guy for you, and if he doesnt then he just isnt worth your time., Good luck :)|`|QpRihtQ6aa	just tell him. i mean, ud prob wanna no 2 if u were being 2 pushy. but tell him nicely lol.|`|838VJJGvaa	Talk to him.

He's not worth it!<br>  <br>  If you don't speak up, he may push into something you're not ready or willing to do!|`|RvSHQtrXaa	Guys who are pushy sometimes lead their partner into regrettable situation if that partner yields.  Immature lovers are also pushy and quick to get sex from their partner.  I  hate it this way.<br>  <br>  For me, if I know the girl loves me, it is the best for the woman to do the pushing.  It is more fulfilling for me.  <br>  <br>  Guys of a pushy sort on there, just relax and things will flow, or your partner will get regretful, sorry and your relationship disintegrates.|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Guys will be as domineering as you allow them to be. Set rules for yourself and do not let them be crossed. When he gets to the point where he is crossing the line you need to be assertive and let him know. Be serious about it with no joking around or begging. Be firm and serious. If he doesnt listen then it is time to take a break (go home or send him home or remove yourself from the situation). Learn to stand up for yourself now while you are young and you will always have that confidence in yourself. This doesnt just have to be about sex but with any boundaries you have in your life, such as saying no to any peer pressures.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, more specifics would help...If he is too controlling, he is not amazing...You'll find out eventually...|`|JqDkLWeTaa	just mmaybe give him a little nudge to get him to back off|`|DozD8lTGaa	just tell him that he is being pushy. it's better to tell the truth. rather than lie just to make him happy. tell him what you just said and that way you can both work it out. you clearly aren't happy with the way he is being... you will get annoyed later on in the relationship and then it could go wrong.<br>  <br>  i dunno though, i 100% think you should talk to him. don't just do what he wants to make him feel happy with you. i hope i have helped. x|`|7uGMyGn2aa	yeah u need to tell him. He maybe dosent even know hes doing it, so he mite be grateful4 u to point it out! And u never know - there mite b something which u do that might piss him off a little - so u cud change that! If u think about it - although discussing each others faults might not seem fun - its good because then it makes u feel more comfortable and strengthens the relationship! :)|`|ggBxkukFaa	He probably can see that you don't like your reaction to how he behaves.. due to body language..but being a thick bloke you need to just watch how he reacts.. then if he doesn't change then you need to be full on and tell him.|`|fb5d7O6Saa	You just need to tell him to stop being pushy. <br>  Kissing is great and its very intimate, so is hugging.<br>  Love is a whole other thing. Love is amazing in itself. If its love you will know it|`|QXoeJqD8aa	Have a serious talk wit him, and tell him that if he loves you he will try to improve if not, then dump him because he is not worth it.|`|jhUfPDByaa	He he he the troll guy makes me giggle|`|LOWWquKkaa	Tell him not to be so pushy.|`|na2axA4taa	just tell him he is being too pushy. he may not even realise he is doing it. you need to remember men dont think like us<br>  hope my answer helped and have a nice day x

AA10065812	Happy-2 is right, but clearly you're more concerned with your own selfish concerns than that of your children.<br>  <br>  Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess up Their Lives <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stupid-Things-Women-Do-to-Mess-up-Their-Lives/Dr-Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060976491/?itm=3" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Ten-Stu...</a><br>  <br>  Stupid Things Parents Do to Mess Up Their Kids <br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Stupid-Things-Parents-Do-to-Mess-Up-Their-Kids/Laura-Schlessinger/e/9780060933791/?itm=12" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Stupid-...</a>|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Absolutely not. Kids aren't stupid; they're going to find out what's going on, and they will grow up thinking that a normal, healthy relationship between a mother and father involves disrespecting and cheating on each other. You have to set the best example for your children here. Not only that, but your kids will be MUCH better off with separated and happy parents, than married and miserable parents. Staying together isn't the be-all and end-all of happy, well-adjusted children. In this case, a divorce would be better for them as long as the two of you can do it peacefully and not drag them in the middle of all the BS.|`|EzZk2pyNaa	No, because cheating is worse. Why stay with someone who you don't even wanna be with? I would think that that would hurt the children worse.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Ho do you think your kids will feel later on if they knew your whole marriage was a lie? and do you really want to be that dishonest with your self? and each other? <br>  Theres no point getting married if this is where your future leads, no point being married if it gets to this point. Just simply get a divorce and live the single life, that way at least its being honest to all involved!|`|W1aYIF71aa	Depends.  If the husband is the cheater then it is fine.  If the wife is the cheater then it is divorce time.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	It would be better to stay together and not cheat, whether there are kids involved or not.|`|B1sT1t44aa	Go into some marriage counseling and get the skills to be right with one another.<br>  Cheating is dangerous if you both see other people and at times could stl be intimate with one another?<br>  You should fight to stay together for the children if there is any hope to keep the marriage together. Because nobody will love the kids as much as the two of you.<br>  Going on the outside looking for answers is not the way to have a happy home for any of you and it could just make matters worse.<br>  In time if that were to happen one of you could get involved with someone else that could come between the marriage anyway and then it would all be over.<br>  I would not even consider cheating but go our separate ways first because kids are smarter than you think and you want them to be raised with morals.|`|bDoJuBEkaa	Divorce is defiantly better. No one should "stay together for the kids". Happily married people don't cheat. If there is cheating there is something fundamentally unhealthy and wrong with the marriage. This leads to unhappy people, unhappy people lead to unhappy children in the long run. Children are very in-tune to what is going on in the home and they will pick up on it and it can cause them all sorts of problems.|`|E4W6KxCMaa	Get divorced...My parents were miserable together and stayed married about 10years longer than they should have and they succeeded in making us all miserable with them. Kids need a happy stable environment. <br>  You can divorce and get along for the kids sakes, but it's difficult to stay together and not have them sense the tension.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	Kids need to have 'happy' parents, doesn't matter if they're married together or not. If you stay in a marriage when love is gone you're sending the wrong message to your children. You're telling your little girl it's ok to be unhappy, it's ok to have a husband cheating on you or it's ok to sacrifice your happiness for someone else. We all know it's not.|`|NGKwsawdaa	option 1- cheat on each other, have the spouse find out, cause big drama and arguements over it, fight all the time, lose trust and in the middle of all this, the kids are watching their parents fight all the time<br>  <br>  option 2- divorce, the kids will be upset but time will heal it, have 50/50 custody and meet someone else.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	If kids are involved and you are thinking about cheating on eachother then its obvious that the relationship is not a healthy one and its not good to have your children around that.Get a divorce and move on with your lives.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Ask your mom what she would do.|`|81wvN8Rraa	Never either work it out or split up.|`|65m62rDraa	No. Staying together for the kids will not make it work for the long run, so you might as well split up and find your happiness elsewhere. Kids feel secured with both parents around, but they can feel your pain if you are not happy together, and it affects them deeply in their own life. Ask many children whom their parents are separated, and they will tell you that as much as it is sad for them to experience the separation, they truly want both parents to be happy.|`|6GIu3Hhvaa	it would be better to divorce if you both think you cannot work things out and have a proper relationship, there is no point in staying together if you cannot be faithful to each other and how will this cheat by both parents impact on the children, it woukd be less harmful to them to split up and continue being good parents sepratly rather than cheating and only staying to gether for the children because you obviously both arent happy or wouldnt be cheating on each other. parents divorcing can be upsetting for the children but if handle the right way they will deal with it but having to live with their parents being together and not wanting to be together would cause them more emotional distress and confusion than a divorce.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Divorce the kids and keep the husband and lovers. It's cheaper that way.|`|LAx5rfm4aa	better to stay togeter|`|fedxavwhaa	divorce and be honest|`|l7U9dGrWaa	no kids aren't stupid
ELSKfMpxaa	It means she doesn't know you well enough to make the call. Get to know her, be her friend, then maybe she'll date you|`|dPULl5hjaa	are you a troll?  Are you the "one" that keeps on posting these weird questions?<br>  <br>  If not, excuse me.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	There are people who are only into half asians?|`|WeSdUJy9aa	Yes, talk to her.  Ask her to go do something together or go out with a group of mutual friends.  You have to make a move if you want anything to happen.|`|Off1rptOaa	yea if i was her i would say the same but no you haven't been shut down...she is prob like me and wants to get to know the person before doing anything with that person. Would you go out with a complete stranger?|`|qOIeRWXFaa	you're looking way too closely.<br>  Relax. You deff. haven't been shut down.|`|22a31ba01d3e8197c234ad3ffffb2facaa	ok I have no idea what a troll is and it's confusing me that people keep saying that... just to let you know lmao ;)<br>  <br>  okkkay so basically, if she said that you're cute then obviously that's a good thing right? Now, if you didn't really talk to her... then she's not just going to be like "OMG yaa i would go out with him" /especially/ not to one of your friends, cause she knows they're going to tell you. Girls aren't likely to just open up randomly to some guy that asks them a question, trust me haha. You deff. were not shut down. A hint: stop getting your friends to do the work, there's a hiiiggh chance that they will end up liking eachother. I know it's harder, but you have got to do it yourself. Start talking to her, keep in mind she thinks your cute... so just act like yourself. And hey, maybe she is into half-asian guys who knows. <br>  Go for it, get to know her better and then ask her out. <br>  You won't regret it. <br>  Good luck!!<br>  xoxox
lIpjuMTHaa	Only you can know. Lots of straight girls watch girl on girl porn, that is not "lesbian or bi-sexual" If you would want to be in a relationship with a woman than that's different and you might be.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Why does it matter. Be who and what you are. Enjoy life. And you may be bi-curious and enjoy watching that. You bf shouldn't mind, unless he is immature or has a low self esteem.|`|AA11284138	test yourself at <a href="http://yourhotbikini.com/" rel="nofollow">http://yourhotbikini.com/</a>|`|AA10743159	I doubt it, countless men, enjoy watching girl on girl porn. That doesn't make them Lesbians, although, they are both after the same thing.<br>  Just in a different manner, so to speak.<br>  I'm sure there are  loads of ladies, who have thought of being with another woman, sexually. It's a bit of the taboo and a bit kinky.<br>  So you may be bi, but, you could just be curious.<br>  Time will tell, it's nothing to worry about. So I wouldn't bring it up to your boyfriend, until, you know for sure, one way or the other.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	It sure sounds it. You need to experiment to find out for certain and you need to be direct with your boyfriend. Nine out of ten guys would love that his girl is bi.|`|rAt4wdMyaa	its always good to experience.|`|hGWhzfFqaa	It doesn't mean your bi. You're considered bi if you can picture yourself doing things to girls and not just watching it. Believe it or not a lot of girls go through the phase where they're not sure, curious, whatever. Girl on girl things turn me on more than straight porn too but I don't think I'd ever be able to actually do anything to a girl.|`|DErBSfZgaa	wow im having the same exact problem and ive also had a boyfriend for two years. well it doesnt mean your bi it just means you enjoy lesbian porn. i do too for some reason but i also loook foward into being with a girl one day. you don't actually know your bi until<br>  you do something sexual with another girl.<br>  so dont stress it, your boyfriend might even find it a turn on.|`|cd9108e5eefb19394649f6cb2d4535e1aa	Only you can say for sure if you are bi, I mean a lot of people watch girl on girl porn that are girls because they are more comfortable with it.<br>  That doesn't necessarily mean that you are bisexual.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	If you actually want to be with another female then yes. Otherwise no.|`|wBnUZxbDaa	i think u are bi <br>  <br>  i think its cool. and most guys do think it's cool|`|eVLUIvDjaa	yea your probably bi. its cool though.<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|bPcTYfcHaa	ask god
0BX8Lozkaa	Let him go, don't spend time trying to change him. It doesn't work. Start over and live your life and MAKE you HAPPY.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Hello,<br>  I'm so sorry that your husband has finished things like this.<br>  For your own dignity, you truly must let him leave and draw a line under it.<br>  If he doesn't want you to contact him, let him go, I realise it is so upsetting for you, but you will feel stronger, sooner than you think.  <br>  There must be reasons why and in your mind somewhere, there must be things you did not like about him - allow yourself to "grieve" for the end of your relationship by all means, but if you feel like you're loosing it, just remember, he is an idiot who walked out on you, and one day, when you get it together, he will see you somewhere, carefree and happy, and cry into his coffee, but then, from your stronger, happier viewpoint, you will not want him back.|`|IvMPh09baa	If he is gone and you can't contact him... how can you make it work?  He's not even there.... what is there to work at if he left???|`|IcH5gMICaa	No, and trust me, you don't want him back.  You may think you do now, but you really are just hurt and want some understanding. <br>  <br>  The best way to get over someone is to meet someone else.  Or to get your own life back that you had before you knew this person.  Remember you BEFORE?  Way back in high school and you did this and that?  Get that back.  Start going out, and stop mopeing around your house.  <br>  <br>  You ask how could he do that?  Because something you were doing drove him to the point of insanity.  But it's not your fault -it's his for not being able to communicate.<br>  <br>  Read the Book, "He's Just Not That Into You" by Greg Behrendt.  <br>  Go out a little bit.  <br>  The minute you get your own life, I guarantee he'll be crawling back and wanting you back.  I just hope you have sense enough to tell him "no way".|`|Eug52iQDaa	He made the decision for both of you.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Sounds as tho he has made his decision, for whatever his reasons are :(|`|874EAxkfaa	what is it's name? you know who he has been with!|`|Ki1gWTzzaa	Hello! that sounds like a rather bizzare way to end a relationship!<br>  <br>  I would bet that he has taken off out of the blue, because he needs to sort his head out! Maybe he could also be making a point...Who knows...<br>  <br>  The answer to whether you can save your marriage is one that you can only really make... It does depend on how your marriage was working!<br>  <br>  There is plenty you can do to make him want you back! The question is can the two of you communicate threw the problems you may have had, and work threw the comprimise...|`|LAx5rfm4aa	pray for him
788d7c7ce9ee2dd89f47d95303ca9817aa	She's your ex for a reason.|`|Jt0MYtXmaa	go out with her|`|SLTlvqRlaa	ehhhh lol ur dumb<br>  <br>  DO HER AND GO!!!|`|Rf2r23sYaa	"i still like her but"... what? That's pretty important information. It sounds like you could make out with her if you wanted to but if you aren't into her then you shouldn't because if you do this kind of drama will only increase in the future.|`|ReCy0Omxaa	What a *****!!!!! Tell her she's an easy skank and you don't like slu*s!|`|SnqsDt1Caa	shes a hoe!|`|7RFRGDL6aa	well why did you dump her?|`|g75ZczmHaa	obviously shes trying to get your attention and you got ask yourself why? have you been hanging out with other girls and shes noticing it? clearly she is being childish about it and this her way of trying to win you over. beware if you start dealing with this girl again there will be consequences sounds like a head case and that shes up to no good|`|4cS2Rg6baa	Do nothing walk her home but say u got if you have a cellphone act like its on vibrate and answer. Tell her you have a emergency at home a pipe just ruptured your neighbor call to tell you GOOD LIE. It will buy you somemore time. CAUSE U DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL FOR HER SAYING YOU RAPED HER.|`|e4b1KDIDaa	like the other person said she is your ex for a reason, but if you still like her and obviously she likes you go for it but don't make a fool of yourself in case she is playing you as a joke or something =)|`|lSCPvOwtaa	dude- she's playin with you.<br>  <br>  Girls like attention- especially from thier exes!  They want to make sure you know EXACTLY what you are missing out on.<br>  <br>  I say act like you don't even notice that kinda stuff.  It will drive her INSANE.|`|7KXN0DDbaa	to me , i will never go along with her whatever she does. what the hell? that's just not me man..that's clear disrespect in my opinion.|`|AA11517929	But what, go out with her if you like her and she likes you,<br>  <br>  wow :P|`|QroCDTR6aa	you still like her but .............she sounds like a bit of a slut to put herself out there like that. I say stay far away
t7YMEcRYaa	I would have a word with your sister. She may just have been messing around but if she wasn't you need to tell her the consequences of underage sex and make sure she is using protection if she is. Don't accuse her or she properly wont talk to you. The last thing you want to do is push her away, because if she trusts you then she is more likely to talk to you and get advice from you, but if you just accuse her she proberly just go out and do it to prove a point. you want her to trust you so she knows she can come to you if she ever needs help x|`|20TxhryDaa	idk i was 13 when i first had sex but i was also very mature for my age. if she is able to deal that level of emotional intimacy then i think shes old enough. but talk to her be the good older sibling and encourage her to talk to ur parents and get protection. i did and they didnt take it as bad as i thought they would|`|8QkF2UVbaa	UMM...I cant answer that because Im the same age. But since she already done it theres nothing you can do about it now.. You shouldve stoped her in the act... ( IM JUST SAYING IF YOU WERE THAT CONCERNED )|`|Ndj9ln7Iaa	Have a word with her.<br>      Her choice, but make sure she's being safe.<br>   Just talk to her about it and make sure she is okay.|`|dShhCo8yaa	That is illegal!<br>  <br>  You should tell your parents!<br>  <br>  Kids these days! <br>  <br>  I didn't loose my virginity until I was 19 and that was only in 1982! Kids these days.|`|Xsm0hZVAaa	no  she's fine but after itsdone ask her if she used a condom|`|oChms6KJaa	Yes, I would let your mom know.|`|JUEkTETAaa	to young and how old are u to not be talking to her about this|`|9HPAzlYBaa	13 AND HAVING SEX..?<br>  <br>  DEFINITELY TOO YOUNG..WHAT IF SHE ENDED UP PREGGO..NOT GOOD.. SHE`S ONLY A BABY HERSELF..I SAY HAVE A TALK WIT HER NAD LET HER KNOW THE CONSEQUNECES OF HAVING SEX SO EARLY..|`|nqQXdMIwaa	i say too young she should save those types ofrelationships for when she is older. you should explain to her all the negatives of having sex too young like teen pregnancy, sti's and more|`|9FoFYfvdaa	beat that ****** ***..<br>  lol..|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Yes, I think she's too young. I think you should tell your parents what you heard. She'll probably be mad at you, but she's barely even a teenager. And good for you, for being concerned about her.|`|RGcXgjEDaa	Are you sure that's whats going on?  it is a little young but not much you can do about it now other then barge in the room|`|mbvpWNMeaa	You have two choices.  Talk to your sister about what you heard (which may or may not be want you think) or talk to your parents.|`|AuWPMH44aa	way too young to be having sex. u shuld have a talk wit her and then if she dnt want to talk to u. tell her that ur going to ur parents.|`|jU6xbBOUaa	Haha maybe tey were just winding you up. But if you're worried about it then confront her about it. Or tell your mum and dad or summin., x|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	since she has already done "it", i'd say ,no........
JYgJD0Rwaa	From the sounds of it, you have an uncontested divorce meaning you both agree to the terms/idea of divorcing. Uncontested divorces do not need lawyers, only contested ones do.<br>  I used a document prep service, around $200, then I had to pay the court filing fee (which varies by state, usually between $150-300) Much cheaper than using a lawyer that you don't need in the first place.|`|abf1bb619e33219626c5a51afbf513daaa	It depends on the state you're in. I'm in PA and it only cost me $164.50 plus $5.00 to get my maiden name back.<br>  <br>  Got it through this site..this site has a list of all states|`|95Yd2ZVyaa	if you both can agree on all points.  Legalzoom.com can be used.  I used it last year with my divorce.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Download page for CSA<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mljpublishinggroup.com/software/MainSoftwarePage_CSA.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mljpublishinggroup.com/softwa...</a>|`|AA11706291	Just the court fees which will vary depending where exactly you are. You should be able to get hold of and fill in all the paperwork yourselves (check if you can get hold of the paperwork online, I know here in the UK you can) fill it in and get it to the court house.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	that depends on the filing process , the court fees, etc. i would suggest you use a lawyer anyways hon. <br>  <br>  My first husband and i divorced back in 1999. I paid for it myself and it cost me $500 total. that's it. my ex waived his rights to appear in court, and we agreed to joint/open custody of our son. i took zero from him. just some furniture i came into the marriage with. He was awarded custody of my dog, which ticked me off...but that's another story.  lol.<br>  <br>  You might be able to find a lawyer that can do it for pretty cheap considering the lack of children, and property.
R1vvH4aKaa	As a matter of fact 30% of all babies that are born are not fathered by the husband. Now you are another statistic! I hope the other resembles you hubby. Assuming that they do not look alike, you have several options but a way to do a concealed paternity test would be the first one to consider. The second one is to try to get a paternity test with the other guy--that will be uphill--. The third is tell your husband and probably get a divorce. A fourth, is keep your mouth shut and try to be the best wife and mother in the world, you cuckold him.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|SAMRKyZsaa	Yes the chance are higher it is your husband <br>  <br>  However think about this did you use protection with your husband or your one night stand. I am guessing you were not trying to get pregant and you used some sort of protection. If it was a condom with your husband did you use one with the one night stand. I am guessing no because you were wrapped up in the moment then chances are higher that it is his.<br>  <br>  Now if you were on the pill that is another story.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Listen, I'm not trying to be rude. But, you are bringing this to a public forum. So, be prepared. There is no way of knowing for sure who the father is until you do a paternity test. It only takes one time to have sex and get pregnant. SO, anyone of those times with either man  could be the time you got pregnant. If your husband is staying in this marriage after all of this, then, you are one lucky girl.|`|wia9SXCPaa	Wow you sure are in a pickle aren't you.  I was always told that you had a better chance of conceiving if you waited a little instead of doing it every night.  So if that is true the chances of your fling being the father are more likely.  <br>  <br>  Probably not what you wanted to hear.  Good Luck your gonna need it!|`|fedxavwhaa	its so bad for you but you can tell your doctor and he will do tests<br>  it maybe from ur husband<br>  but mostley from the other guy because you must have tried with him some different situations other than ur husband|`|ml2FDYECaa	Wow. I will tell you that I have a friend who ended up having a child that isn't her husbands. I think he know (he does I'm sure) but carries him as his own with no doubt about it. You screwed up in the 'past' but you have a bright future to look forward to. Don't worry. At least you are going to have this child. Love your husband, and child as much as you can. Carry with your marriage, and make it up by being the best wife you can be...GL|`|IKXZZDH9aa	I agree with the first guy. You need to tell your husband the truth because it should be his choice to decide upon the marriage.<br>  <br>  The result of hiding this and it coming out at a later date would be horrific for not only your husband, but that child as well.<br>  <br>  On top of this, states are becoming more and more serious about paternity fraud, to the point of passing legislation that could land you in prison for doing so nowadays. <br>  <br>  Do the right thing, you already did the selfish thing and had a one night stand, don't continue the trend by trying to hide this.<br>  <br>  Edit: To answer your question, it could be either one of them that fathered this child.<br>  <br>  My wife got pregnant in a weekend changing from the patch to the pill. She stopped using the patch on  a Friday and started the pill on Monday...between those 2 days she got pregnant.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	I am almost positive it is your husband.<br>  Please, no more night stands after your husband comes.<br>  It could lead to a yucky divorce.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Do condoms or pulling out come into play?  The one who got you pregnant is most likely the one who, you know, into you.  You can also ask the doctor the exact day of conception to figure out who's the daddy.  Sorry to hear about your situation.  Good luck.|`|x3EPqezJaa	No, it doesn't matter how often or how many times you had sex with a guy--it just matters who you had sex with when you ovulated. Any attempt at reassurance would be false. <br>  <br>  You do need to tell your husband.|`|hvwp2bcVaa	No..that doesn't have anything to do with it..it depends on who you had sex with closest to your cycle...|`|o1yy6KABaa	Theres really not much of a way of telling unless you know exactly when you ovulate which is USUALLY 10-14 days from the day your period starts, so if you can work that one out you will have more of an idea, but not everyone ovulates around this time, some ovulate earlier or later. <br>  Sperm can live for up to 5 days and is stronger if a male DOESNT ejacualte, therefore theres always a chance the father is the one night stand guy as opposed to your husband. It could also depend on how fertile your husband is. <br>  <br>  unfortunately alot of it is guess work until the paternity test is taken. Good luck and dont stress too much, just focus on the health of your baby x0x|`|81wvN8Rraa	Well honestly it doesn't matter how much you have sex with your husband it only matters that you had sex when you were ovulating so if you know about when you ovulate then that could help you but really there is no way to know except through testing.|`|FdixIDR1aa	Unfortunately the amount of times you have sex has nothing to do with who the father is. It only takes one time to make a baby. I wish you the best and please learn from your mistake.|`|SovaFpN8aa	No, based on Murphy's Law and the Law of Perversity, if their is any chance this baby is not your husband's, then it will not be his.|`|Ih18jMNyaa	God Bless you and your marriage!<br>  <br>  <br>  That being said you need to tell your husband the truth and live with the results!<br>  <br>  The decision is up to him NOT you!|`|AA11457957	Whoa! you have to tell the truth and this baby is the most important one! Actions have consequences!|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	No, it would be totally random.  If there were any edge at all, it would probably be the first guy.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Let me consult my crystal ball...meet me back here in five.|`|IcH5gMICaa	No, chances are it's the other guy.  Think about it:  you've had sex w/ your husband lots of times, never once had any type of "accident".  Then you meet this guy and -boom!  I read somewhere (probably Cosmo) that it's more probable in instances like this one that it's usually the other guys..<br>  <br>  And who cares...you made some choices.  Can't say I haven't done the same thing recently.  In fact, if your husband is anything like a douch bag like mine is...then I completely understand lol ;) <br>  Here's what ya do...go through w/ the pregnancy.<br>  You will be able to find out once the baby is born.<br>  Do the test, figure out which one it is, and then continue on with life. <br>  It sucks, but that's really all you can do at this point.  <br>  <br>  By some stroke of luck, hopefully it will be his.  I just hope that uh, they weren't different races or anything lol...it happens.
eK2nRJL3aa	I really don't see anything funny about that. The same way girls wouldn't find it funny if a guy told us to stand that way and then grabbed our breasts. People thinking these things are just jokes are what allow girls to do whatever they want and this behavior needs to be stopped before those "girls" grow into women. That teacher should have said something, if for no other reason than because it's assault and if she saw a boy doing anything even remotely similar to that, it would have been assault/sexual assault. I really think it's disturbing that your mother didn't care either. It's part of that whole attitude of boys having to be "tough" so they should be able to take anything that girls dish without complaint. It's stupid and it's dumb and probably has a lot to do with why so many serial killers and rapists turn out to be men. It's not a joke, and it's not funny. If you are truly bothered by it, then I suggest you tell the principal about it.|`|dPULl5hjaa	the same questions over and over and over and over|`|fC8OPOTkaa	thats sick i would never do that to a guy.<br>  <br>  :) X|`|GoABmevnaa	wow that's really immature. You should have slapped her back in the boobs really hard and asked if she liked that! <br>  My boyfriend said that his ex used to do that to him all the time because she thought i was funny.... but obviously it wasn't and that's why he's not with her anymore.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	OMG!!! I've never done that and I've never heard or seen any girls do this, but I'm from Germany.. maybe things are different over here. <br>  <br>  I think these girls are very immature. Just make sure you don't spread your arms and legs anymore and stay away from them.|`|3ijLQe5laa	tell that biyach to stop hitting you in the nuts. You have to be hard on these hoes! dont let no one disrespect!!!!|`|K8OjmMUAaa	Absolutely NOT. The only time a girl should ever hit a guy in the nads is in self defense. A girl hitting a guy - especially there - JUST because she knows he won't hit her back is about as "funny" as a man hitting a woman he knows can't fight back. It's cowardly, immature and cruel. <br>  <br>  First, you should tell your counselor, principal or whoever else that a teacher saw a girl hit you and actually laughed at it. That teacher had NO business doing that - she should have punished the girl immediately. To take no action is bad enough, but to actually laugh at it? You need to report her, AND the girl to someone who will actually do something about it. <br>  <br>  You have every right to stand up for yourself, and I hope that you do. Unfortunately it seems that most women and girls just don't get how bad it really does hurt, but you can be sure if you'd kicked that girl i nthe crotch there would have been hell to pay. So yes, you have every right and reason to demand justice for yourself. And don't listen to your Mom on this one, either. She sounds just as cruel and petty as the girl who kicked you. I can't believe that she didn't get at least a little bent out of shape over her own son getting hurt. Maybe you should talk to your Dad about it, if you can. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|QWveO9kpaa	If I were a boy I wouldn't accept it personally I think that is a terrible thing to do.I don't see why a teacher would laugh at that it probaly hurt.Anyway to the advice.I think you should stand up after all your a guy and their girls.I know you might be shy and this might not help you but I remember I used to be the shy girl but I still stood up to the boys.I know you can do it.lol pep talks might not help :D well I hope it helps at least a little bit.|`|EFFPRtDTaa	IM a girl!!<br>  well to be honest i actually say that to allot of guys when they try to do things to me so..... i go for it and i stop because it would probably if i was kicked there! sorry but they could just be picking on you because they think ur hot and they like you! so don't let it get you down ur probably really cute!|`|fPWiNzuQaa	Some do. You now know not to fall for it. Block next time anyone tries to kick you in the groin|`|IgO9jHq6aa	tell them to stop or get use to it i dont know anyone that dose that.|`|F4fWTwkyaa	u a bytch! on God i woulda beat her @ss|`|iUtb3sq5aa	im a girl, and i dont think its right that we can go and kick guys in the balls and put them through unbreable pain when you cant get revenge on us.<br>  <br>  i mean, kicking us in the vag isnt get anyone anywhere, it doesnt hurt.<br>  <br>  i feel so bad for guys . and i think girls who have to go low enough to kick someone in the balls for no reason is just stupid, they should grow up.<br>  <br>  cause eventually they'll be doing something with those balls one day.
ilx6DeVYaa	honestly, i would find a city and live in a shelter there. that's what they are there for, and if you get out from under your mom, you can get a job and save and get an apartment. i know in most places you don't have to wait until you're 21 to rent a place. i would go somewhere else, honestly. if it's that bad, you need to take care of yourself. you're young and can get a good job somewhere. work at a restaurant or something. (i wouldn't go to las vegas, but some city like that, yea.)|`|65m62rDraa	I am sorry you have to live this way. Many people in this country and all over the world are struggling to survive. We all have our battles, and we have to make many choices. My best advice to you is to focus on the blessings in your life (as little as it might seem to you), and make the choices that will be productive in bettering your life in the future. With each action there is a reaction, so consider your steps, and choose wisely.<br>  Good luck!|`|DXN8sK0maa	uhmmmm why cant u just live with ur mom.?|`|CdTe8MO4aa	maybe you and your mom could get a job there at the hotel<br>  intill use find a nice apartment|`|LC3TGSr3aa	If you run away your abandoning your own family. Yes it's hard and I can understand why you would want to leave but if you want to be the better person the best thing you could do is get a job yourself and help your mom. It's hard being a single mother of two teenagers and not being able to afford what you need. <br>  <br>  Just remember, if you leave, they wont think of you as part of their family. You wont have a family. Until you make new friends you'll be completely alone in the world. <br>  <br>  And living in a shelter isn't any better. I used to work at one with my dad and trust me it's not fun. You come, you eat, you leave. They don't always have nough beds and it's not a full time thing it's only for a while. <br>  <br>  And, las vegas? That doesn't seem like the best place to go when your on your own. Find a better more reasonable place to live if you choose to abandon your family when they need you most.
qg6Dntq5aa	That means your boyfriend is not a mature person, not valuing the relationship as it should. This will affect you a little bit because you realize that you are looking to be with their peers than with you. Do not be silly. you have to talk clearly, to choose, that's all.|`|PZODV3QQaa	thanks for the 2 points see yah

I have custody of my little girl and absolutely love being her father.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	I didn't ask I simply filed and had her served.  The reason is that she became an alcoholic.  I kept trying to get her into rehab and she refused to go until she had a DUI.  She then had an affair with someone she met at rehab.  That was it for me.  <br>  <br>  I do not or will not ever regret divorcing her.  I am now happier than I have been in years.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	The reason why I wanted the divorce was because I was tired of all the mental abuse that I went through and arguing all the time. I will never regret my divorce.|`|W1aYIF71aa	1.  Wouldn't have a threesome with her sister.<br>  <br>  2.

He was verbally and physically abusive and I had a 2 month old son at the time. I wasn't going to bring my child up in that environment. I do not regret it. I am remarried, a stepmother, and have a good relationship with my husband who is respectful towards women. Getting divorced was the best decision I ever made.|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Well for your first answer.I asked for my divorce many yrs.ago because i had 2 young children that did not need to be or deserve to be around a man that was drunk and on drugs 24/7.He was abusive and i am sorry no woman should put up with that or keep her children around that.For your second answer.I do not regret it.My kids are happier and i have since remarried and found a wonderful man that is good to both myself and my children.|`|AA11706291	not speaking from personal experience here, my friend asked for his divorce because his wife upped and left, wouldn't tell him where she was and although claimed she wanted their marriage to work she made no effort to come back.<br>  <br>  He is unhappy at the time being as it's not over and done with (still in the process) but I think and he believes once it is over and done with he will be a lot happier|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	I really didnt' "ask" for the divorce. I just filed for it because of his many, many affairs. <br>  Apparently he had been cheating for quite a while, but he was a pathological liar and he covered his bum pretty well.<br>  At first I regretted it because we had a child, but after trying to give him another chance I saw he was not willing to change so it was made clear to me that divorce was the only option.|`|W0qFAIVuaa	I asked because she left me for the third time and I heard from a friend she was thinking about it herself.So I didn't want to wonder when it was coming.Yes happy I did it.No regrets at all.Have a wonderful gf now.Kind of rough and lonely the first year.Just me and the yellow lab.I have a 20 year old son but his gf keeps him on a short leash.My daughter lives with her mother.She is in her third year of high school with hardly enough credits to be a freshmen.And pregnant at sixteen.The mother of the year award is not headed my X's way.|`|6YVckVa2aa	Because he wasnt ready to grow up, after 5 years of marriage and a daughter<br>  I am very happy i divorced him.

gC7OMToraa	Start off slow and you'll get used to it. Try to be more flirty.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	ugging is the single most under-exercised human ability. With a hug you can say, “Hello. Goodbye. I miss you. I like you. I love you. You’re amazing. Good game. I want your sex. Thank you. I’m sorry. I hope you feel better. I know the world is a big, bad, scary place, but it’s all going to be OK.” It’s like a physical, “Aloha!” Plus, when done right, hugging makes your whole body tingle with joy. Hugging is nearly always just what the doctor ordered; the only problem is, doctors don’t order it nearly enough leaving a majority of the world’s population hug starved. Most people are average huggers, some people are amazing huggers and the rest give the worst hugs on the planet. Follow these steps to put more meaningful hugs in your life.|`|cflktD34aa	I'm sure it will grow on you. i used to be the same and now i have friends who want to hug me all the time. at the begining i hated it but im used to it by now!|`|fs8wMQLFaa	LOL! I'm an introvert as well. You don't need to change, don't worry! If you have amazing friends, then they will accept you for who you are- a shy person who doesn't like touchyness. And if they won't- there's no need to change for them, as this is probably not a long friendship.<br>  Good luck!<br>  Hugs, Smiley.

AA10065812	If you're paying child support, through the courts, which is the only legal way to do it, than she gets the deduction.

You can be re-ordered to pay for the same time period.<br>  <br>  Now, I'm a fathers rights advocate, but before going on, I must state that it's inappropriate for you to be with anyone while still married.

This is one of those gray areas with the IRS  but since she managed to file first, you lose. Now you can always sue her in small claims court for half of what you think she should pay.

I highly doubt you thought she was your "best friend" while knowing she must have been talking bad about you.  Sounds like you let people influence your relationships through gossip rather than dealing with things head on.  Just a bunch of freaking drama.  You should have invited her to lunch for a sit down talk about what's going on.  How stupid that you're not talking to her because of a bunch of BS you heard from outside sources.  But she can't act like an adult?  Are you acting like an adult?|`|3e657243a606e14632ec806cc8f3adf1aa	You cant.  I am sure she will be there even if she tells everyone she is not coming.

That way you'll have written proof that she was indeed invited.<br>  <br>  Then let the chips fall where they may. <br>  <br>  If she comes, be charming, delightful, and friendly - because you are the more mature person in this tiff. Honor her. <br>  <br>  Whether or not she comes - and especially if she doesn't, offer a toast at the reception (whether she is there or not) but make it a nice toast - like how much you appreciate her raising such a wonderful man as your husband etc. <br>  <br>  Let her dig her own hole. She's not fooling anyone. Just let her dig her own hole. YOU - raise above all of this and be gracious and charming and lovely and sweet - even to a mean-spirited kook like your MIL.<br>  <br>  My Mother used to say - You can't shovel S@#$T without getting it on you. So insofar as your MIL is concerned, don't even pick up the shovel. Just let her show the family just what a mean-spirited kook she really is.<br>  <br>  Will this be easy? Of course not. But you're up to it. Why? Because you have class and she doesn't.

In regards to getting her to lose the grudge and come, is no longer in your job description.<br>  <br>  My attitude would be "we'll miss you" and just carry on.  Honestly, why are you stressing out over having someone attend your wedding who talks behind your back and spreads lies about you? It isn't worth your mental energy.<br>  <br>  If your fiance really wants his mom there, then he should talk to her. Let him handle that. You be polite and civil to her. But let him manage the rest of tht relationship.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't even worry about her telling all sorts of stories back home. First of all, you no longer live there, so what does it matter if her card club thinks poorly of you. You don't know them.

Don't try to change her mind.  If she doesn't come then she will look like a terrible person and if she does, good.  Don't worry about the guest list.  When I was planning my wedding my mom told me that she didn't want to take off of work so I would have to plan the wedding around her schedule-I didn't, and we decided that eloping was the best idea for everyone.  Every family gets into fights and that doesn't mean that you should just shut them out.  If your MIL doesn't go to your wedding, don't take it personally.  It is a day for you and your husband and who ever else wants to share in your joy.  If she doesn't don't worry.  It's not your problem.  <br>  <br>  Send her an invitation in the mail.|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Nothing you do will make her change her mind. If she chooses not to come to the wedding that is her choice, and by the sounds of her I would say you are better off. She is only hurting herself by not attending her son's wedding. You have done what you can do, and I have to give you props for not arguing with her and stooping to her level. I would say maybe send her one last email saying that she welcomed at your wedding but if she chooses not to go you both understand that way she can't turn around later and say she wasnt invited.|`|FnskUYpqaa	I think if you really want to be the bigger person (and it sounds like you have been this whole time) go and speak with her in person tell her that you want to forget about everything that happend and start new and that she is important and you want her at the wedding.

See what happends, good luck!|`|KOYZfaDkaa	If I were in your situation I would still send her an invitation and leave it at that. I wouldn't go out of my way to kiss up to her, she's an adult and she knows she's being a moron.

Don't let her get you down, maybe it's a good thing she wants to pout by herself :)|`|AA10029021	I would definately send her an invite. I would also maybe send her an email explaining that the invite is on it's way and that it would mean alot to both of you if she came to the wedding.

Hopefully evenything works out.|`|gpL7W3jAaa	You've handled the situation well up until this point. It's sad to see that his mother is acting so immature.

Tell her that you would really love for her to be there and if she chooses not to be there then its by her own choice.|`|AA10473272	Wow!  Sounds like all of you need to do some growing up!  Sorry.  I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, but it seems that everyone is acting quite childish.  Don't listen to other family members.  Sometimes when someone says something like, "You know, she is telling everyone lies about you!", they might not like her . . . or you . . . and they want to put a "wedge" between the two of you to get revenge or to just see how they can manipulate people.  Don't write things to her in an email.  Words in an email can be interpreted so many ways that often a very nice comment will come across as a very rude comment.  I suggest  you place a call and talk to her in person and explain how much you want her to come to the wedding.  If she still refuses, go ahead and get married . . . it will be her loss and not yours.  Good luck!
