He went to the bathroom last night at around 10 (ate the candy at  3:30) and seemed fine.      But today he has not gone to the bathroom, he has peed, but will not poop. It is 6:19PM now so it has been almost a full day.My dad does not want to take him to the vet, but I said if he does not go by tomorrow morning he needs to go to the vet tomorrow, but my dad say;s that we need to wait 48 hours and if he still hasn't gone bring him Monday.       would you bring him tomorrow or Monday if he still does not go to the bathroom? and is there anything else I can do for him, he seems to be acting normal besides not going to the bathroom.

20090307152535AAQ7mGj	Pets;Dogs	Has anyone ever been hurt by their own dog before?	My pup is 9 months old and about 65 pounds. He has a history of getting out and being very tough to catch and it scares me to death each time he gets out because one day I bet he's gonna get away from me and not come back.      Today when my dad got home he snuck out the door and I grabbed him on the porch but he wiggled free. So as a last resort I managed to grab the end of his tail hoping I could stop him but he kept going (probably because I had his tail and I was hurting me so he ran forward to get free.) I was still holding his tail as he dragged me headfirst down our 7 brick stairs onto the hard concrete sidewalk. I didn't really have much contact with the stairs but it was more of a headfirst downward leap to the sidewalk while being dragged by the dog.       When I hit the ground I wanted to die. I was emabarrassed and in terrible pain. I had landed on my left hip and had scraped up my arms, lower back, & legs. Now im in awful pain and im pissed beyond belief at my dog.      So im thinkin' isn't it crazy the things we do for our pets? I went through all this just so my dog wouldn't get out. Did anything like this ever happen to you? Or just being hurt by your dog at all?      Please don't lecture me btw, I know im a dumba*s

However, I was wondering if its safe to place it in my freshwater fishtank.      The shell was not picked up from a beach and then just taken home...    it was bought at an artisan shop and no paints or anything were added to it as far as i can tell.      It has the typical glossy look with natural colors and designs that i really cant imagine a human doing it.      So....   Would it be safe to add it to my aquarium?

20090307152900AAFI4kK	Pets;Dogs	How do I get my dog to stop barking?	I have a chihuahua/yorkie mix. She is 3 years old. She is a really good dog, when I am home, but right when I leave, she just barks and barks the entire time I am gone. My neighbors are complaining (I live in a duplex, which I own)    I have tried everything I can think of.

20090307153834AAHwpIi	Pets;Horses	Do you think this could be a good horse for me?	I will be getting my first horse in a few months, and I think this mare would be ideal! I have a lot of riding experience, and right now I ride 3-6 times a week on my leased horse.   While this will be the first horse I will own, I do not need (or want) a kids-horse, or "an older, been-around-the-block type".   I have some experience training, and riding green horses, and I love doing it! I cant stand riding "finished" or "push-button" horses...I need things to work on. My instructor told my mother that a younger horse would be fine for me, and most of the successful youth riders at my stable basically started from scratch with their horses.   I am prepared for repetitive, dragging work.    http://www.equinehits.com/horses-for-sal...    what do you think?
20090307153127AA3DBoZ	Pets;Dogs	Does anyone know the causes of mushy stools in dogs?	All right, Y!Answers folks, don't let me down.      I'm currently house-sitting for an acquaintance, who owns a dog very similar to a Pomeranian in size and appearance {I'm not precisely sure if it is a Pomeranian: at any rate, it's a small dog}.  The rules are that she is fed once a day, with enough dry food to cover three-fourths of the bottom of the bowl and half-a-can of wet food.  She is also rewarded with a treat after every walk.      I thought I was following this regime faithfully.  Today, she has made a BM on every walk {which is supposedly unusual}.  The first stool comes out fairly easily and is mostly solid; the second one she has to strain some, and it's a mushy {NOT RUNNY} consistency.  I have not yet noticed mucus or blood in any of the stools, but I'll be checking way more carefully tomorrow.      The only cause I might have contributed to was feeding her more wet food, by accident, last night, which would contribute to this mess today.      I make sure she has enough water, and she has no problems with urinating.  Also, if this helps, she's got as voracious an appetite as ever and is still very energetic.

20090307153617AAnUiOJ	Pets;Dogs	I think my dog just had a seizure?	I was with my two poms at the dog park, when Simba, started acting weird. Simba is pretty old (he's 10) and he has heart problems and takes Vetmedin and Lasix. It seems like his muscles tightened up: he was lifting up his leg like it hurt, but there wasn't anything stuck in his leg and he was just sitting so there wasn't anything he could have done to hurt it. He was shaking, kind of spasming. Also I think he was drooling a lot, because his chest was really wet when I picked him up. He seems fine now, but he seems pretty confused like he doesn't know what just happened. I called emergency and they just said to keep and eye on him and bring him in if it happens again. Does anyone else have experience with this? Was this actually a seizure or was he just being weird? Sorry for how long this is but I'm just really worried and kind of freaked out.

20090307120238AAf7YJA	Pets;Dogs	Please will all of the kind owners take more care when they advise potential dog owners.?	I know that there are experienced dog owners who leave their dogs when they go to work. Kind and caring owners make provisions for their dogs. They get up early, take their dogs out for a long walk and come home at lunchtime. Often they ask a neighbour to let their dogs into the garden, or pay a professional to walk their dogs.  Some people also drop their dogs off at day crèches. These kind and caring people then rush home from work and take their dog for a long walk.      There are often questions from potential dog owners who ask for advice before they get a dog. Most of these questions are from people who work full time and have never had a dog.  The questions are always about how long a dog can be left alone. Unfortunately the caring owners give advice without, clarifying how this can be done and tell the Asker that they can leave a dog or even a puppy alone for nine hours.      Please will all of you caring owners think about this and elaborate on your answers. If you fail to do this, you are encouraging thousands yes thousand of people to buy a puppy and leave it alone in misery.  Remember that your reply is not read just by the Asker, it is read by thousands of people.       I have heard people say “I fancy a dog, I will give it a try” then they dump it when it pees and poos. I also read an article about a man who bought a puppy and stopped feeding it because it pooed. Daft uncaring people buy dogs and it is up to us all to dissuade them. If we fail to illustrate the pitfalls and the expense of getting a puppy, we are perpetuating the sales of BYB’s  and the poor dogs who are dumped.

20090307115559AAPGHe9	Pets;Fish	29gal crabitat......?	I just set up a 29gal crabitat for hermit crabs, and it doesn't look like there's enough room. There is 5"-7" of sand in all parts of the aquarium. There is two water bowls, the smaller one will have salt in it, the bigger one won't. There is a dish that will have food in it, a hiding area made out of cardboard which will be changed regularly, but I'm not buying a permanent hiding area yet, will before I get the crabs. Theres several fake plants around for them to climb in, two fisher-price blocks for them to climb on, and one fisher price ball for them to climb on. It still doesn't seem like there is enough room. It's a 29gal, which is a lot larger than the one we used to have when I was a kid, it was around 10gal. is there anyway to make it so theres more walk around room instead of running into things?

20090307120200AAsKWPQ	Pets;Dogs	My dog has diarrhea...Help!?	Yesterday, my dog started having diarrhea. I think that it may just be because he had a different brand of food for 3 days during the week (Mon - Wed), and may have even had some cat food. I was visiting my sister's house, so he was eating whatever kind of food her dog eats. And he had access to her cat's food, too. It has never been a problem before, but i don't know if she recently switched dog foods and this one doesn't agree with him or what. He is back home now and on his regular food. He has had this food for over a month with no problems.      Do you think that it is just the change of food for a few days? And if so, will it go away on its own or will i have to take him to the vet? Even if he does have to go to the vet, it would have to wait until Monday. They close early on Saturdays and are not open Sundays....Is there anything I can do or give him to help clear it up? Thanks!      Oh, and I don't knoe if this makes any difference, but he is a 20 months old male beagle.

She pricks at the rug by the door to get out of my room which means that I have to get up to let her in and out.      The rug is totally destroyed and there is plain splintery boards there,      I have tried blocking the door with pillows and all that creats is her meowing all night which means I can't sleep.      I can't put her in another room or she'll destroy those doors by scratching the inside of them, they are cheap wood.      We have thought about a cat door but all that would do would make me not fall asleep any faster.       My brother would poke his head through all the time and bother me, if I told him to stop he wouldn't listen.      I really don't want to give her up either what should I do, how do I stop her from doing this so I have a good night sleep?      Please help! Thx.

20090307120350AAjxcV1	Pets;Dogs	My dog is a brat. Help?	My dog has become a total brat. We got her about 6 months ago from the animal shelter, and we are almost certain that she was abused. She is a pure bred German Shepherd, and she's about 3 years old. When we first got her, she was very afraid of men and wouldn't eat at all. I had to spoon feed her to get any nutrition in her at all.       Now she's doing much better, but she's become a brat! She doesn't listen to me, my mom, or my sister. Whenever we call her, she looks up at us as if to say, "You're kidding, right?" and lays her head back down. She eats her poop, sticks her nose right in our food (she's big enough to put her whole snout on the table), and constantly does things she knows she's not supposed to do, such as pooping in the livingroom and going up on the furniture. Help!

He seems to only get worse by the day.  I heard Raising the temperature wold speed up the ich life cycle, so i'm wondering if thats why he's showing up with even more spots.

Don't worry, I've been doing my research and I'm not stopping yet! I have to room for it, that's no problem. I'm just a little confused will the whole BCC and BCI thing, I don't understand the difference. I really think all boas look the same as well, like Nicaraguan, Colombian, Hogg Island. Obviously as they reach adulthood, you can see a size difference, but still, how are they distinguished? How can you tell the difference between a BCC and a BCI? Also, every care sheet I read gives me different size stats.       Owners out there, how big is your common red tail boa and it's age? Is it full grown? What's their temperament like? Again, I'm not planning on getting one tomorrow or anything. Just looking into them.

20090307115323AASEMJ0	Pets;Dogs	Can puppies be in so much pain when teething that they cry and howl at random?	My puppy is almost 5 weeks old and I got him 4 days ago. He's been eating regularly and he pees and has solid poops. He has been acting like every other puppy does when he cried it was just because he would want out of his cage to go to the bathroom. I care very much for this puppy and have been taking very good care of him. Today he is crying and howling out of random like he is in pain but its not constant it comes and goes like he'll be sleeping and then burst out crying and howling. This morning he had a big green goober in one eye and when he is crying really hard he'll roll onto his back but I dont think theres a reason to that im just letting you know. His crying calms when i hold him and walk around but its not lack of attention this puppy has my attention his every waking moment. The last puppy I had in May of last year I had for a week only bc he died of distemper and it was a horrible horrible event for me to go through. So now when I see this puppy acting like this it deeply concerns me. Im hoping its just teething...

There is Absolutely NO place for him to run around because of the huge pool & deck. There's also a lot of garbage & a nasty smell that i can notice from quite a few feet away.    The thing that breaks my heart is that he is trying to dig a hole to get into our yard. (trust me, he can't. there's wood that's blocking it) Every time I'm outside playing with my dog he starts to whine & bark. It's also dangerous for him because now there are some jagged pieces on the fence, so when he sticks his head there it probably hurts. D: He is SO SO SO sweet and he doesn't bite (well he hasn't tried to bite ME! he only licks xp) & i just wish he lived in a house where people actually cared about him. He's young too, so I think he can be trained & become a great member of any family.   What do you think?? PLEASE HELP!!

20090307133649AAkdPLV	Pets;Dogs	Allergic dog prescribed Hill's z/d food?!?	My dog has been having some serious issues with allergies since I adopted him from the local shelter 3 months ago. We weren't sure if he had only environmental allergies or if there were food sensitivities also, but now we are pretty sure he's deathly allergic to some foods too.      Last saturday I tried to introduce EVO red meat to slowly switch him to grain-free but he refused to eat anything other than two pieces of kibble. Apparently that was enough to set him off in a serious allergic reaction with scratching, chewing at his skin furiously, and a couple of red spots in his belly. Well, on Tuesday night he managed to eat a tiny piece of chocolate and then his body almost shut down. After yet another extremely expensive trip to the vet's due to diarrhea, widespread rashes, muscle tremors and serious lethargy, he was sent home with prescription food for the intestinal issues (the i/d). Last night the vet called with the blood test results that ruled out any other health issues, which makes him pretty confident the dog has extreme food sensitivities. He now put my dog on Hill's prescription z/d food for 3 months to do a proper food trial. After that, if the symptoms have cleared up and we are sure it was all due to food allergies, we will start experimenting with other foods and protein sources to see if we can find something else he can eat.      Has anyone here been through this? Besides the obscene cost of this food ($90+ for a 27.5 lb bag), it seems to me that the food is not really "healthy" either. I guess I'm looking for people who have tried this elimination food trial and have good or bad results to report. Should I hope for the best and do the 3 month food trial or what?!?       Thanks!

Well, he just falls over, his front legs stick up, his eyes are weird, he looks as if he is choking on his tongue, and his tries to walk with his back legs. It's really scary.      My grandma keeps saying he'll be fine, but my mom is going to take him to the vet tomorrow to see if he can get any medication.      Does Rusty have epilepsy?    If he doesn't, what does he have?   Will he be okay?   What medication will he get?      I'm really scared for him, and after he has his episodes he's completely normal like nothing happened... please help!

20090227082606AAaGvxp	Pets;Dogs	Anyone who uses the Gentle Leader collar : does your dog hate it like mine does?	He's 9 months old and we've been using it on him for about a month. He walks nice on the lease and doesn't drag me anymore. But he resists it to the fullest. Its a struggle to put it on him because he doesn't like it and because he gets so hyper knowing he's about to go out/ for a walk. As soon as I get the thing on him he starts trying to paw it off and he lays down and rolls and tries to take it off.       Once I get the leash on and we start walking he is alright and basically stops resisting but I can still tell it annoys the hell out of him.        He acts like its itchy even though I know its on correctly and not to tight. Some times he rolls his head in the leaves outside and rubs his nose on stuff trying to pull it off...      Its gotten better since we 1st started using it. At least now he will tolerate wearing it but just isn't happy about it. He used to refuse to walk with it on at all.      Is it possible he just will never get used to it being on? Does your dog do this too?

20090307122113AAvc01f	Pets;Reptiles	My Leopard Gecko is acting odd, help?	About 5 days ago I ran out of crickets for my leopard gecko and since the local pet shops hadn't been stocked with small crickets or meal worms I had no choice but to give him a couple wax worms. I gave him 2 small ones a day for 3 days (I know thats not much etc but I was trying to avoid getting him hooked on them) I also had tried those 'can of crickets' but he refused them. Anyway, while they were out of most food sources they were also out of the reptile carpet I use for him so I switched him to paper towels until they get more. I purchased meal worms and what they had of small crickets once they got them in but now he's not eating as much. Usually he would eat 5-6 small crickets. Now he's eating 2-3 meal worms and hasn't bothered with the crickets. Could there be something wrong with him? He was fine before all his... do you think once he gets his carpet back (Im still waiting for them to get it in, if they don't I'll order online) and sheds (He's looking pale-ish) he'll act normal again? Any help is really great, thank you!

He's a boxer mix with a blood hound, a MAJOR sniffer!  Anyway, with spring coming, I would like to get a fence for him so he's no longer on a leech all the time.  I'm not sure which way to go, I hear hounds shouldn't have invisible fencing because they go right through them, but I hear boxers are known to scale up fences.  He's not fond of cats at all, so I'm a bit worried about invisible fences.  HELP!  I have a normal town-sized lot, live in Michigan so I need something that will be good all year around.  Not looking for something extremely pricey, and I'd like to install it myself.  Thanks!

I pulled the trees up and covered the holes with soil.  I wanted to plant more grass on the bare spots.  I wouldn't be using fertilizer but I'm wondering if grass seed is harmful to dogs.  I'm also trying to get a steak into the ground to keep her in the general area till she goes poop.  After she poops I'll give her free roam (trainers advise).  My problem is, my yard has rocks underneath the soil.  I'll get the stake partially in there but hit rock about half way down.  We knew this about our yard.  We had a fence installed and the fence guys had trouble because of our rockey soil.  Is there a device (example: like a stud finder for walls) that will help me find a clear spot for the stake?  A runner is not an option because we have nothing to hook the ends onto.  If I hook a runner onto my vinyl fence I'm most certain she could pull it down eventually.

20090307130547AAc4xqy	Pets;Birds	What is happening to our Guinea Hens?	Of course, I am typing this nearly 5 thousand miles away from home, but I am absolutely flabbergasted.  My family has owned guinea hens (normally a flock up to 20 birds) for over ten years and suddenly, this year, something completely unexpected happened.        This summer we purchased chicks from private breeders instead of going to the local stores because we wanted pied chicks instead of the run of the mill brown and grays.  However, about a few months ago, after reaching adulthood, the birds have perished, leaving our once strong pack of 16 to a meager group of two.      While we originally suspected it was just the breeders, despite us gathering clutches from around the state, our original bird didn't survive whatever went around the coop.        I remember walking in one time and seeing one of the sick birds opening its beak and craning its neck.  My father has also reported the ill ones stop preening and roosting near the heat lamp.        Does anyone know what happened to make us lose so many birds in such a short time?  Also, is there a way to prevent our last two girls from kicking the bucket?  Any help is appreciated!

The vet said to let the dog tell me when he tired and that is when to stop walking. The problem is he never runs out of energy. Today I walked him 4 miles and I was sore but he was still fresh. If I don't walk him he is bouncing off the walls being hyper in the house and starts being destructive and generally making a nusience of himself. I don't want to harm him by walking him too much but at the same time he has all this energy he needs to get rid of. What do I do? Thanks in advance!

20090307130110AAHwOrj	Pets;Dogs	My dog is eating his poop. (little long)?	Ive had this dog for 3 years now, Ive never had a problem with him (health wise) until a few months ago.         Before I took him to the vet, he was already scared to poop, he would hold it for 2 days or so, and end up pooping in the house.....and he would make a totally disgusting mess because his poop would come out so fat it would hurt him, hed spin around while pooping biting the poop off and when it would fall to the floor, he'd eat it.Sometimes hes even bleed.Then I started forcing him to go outside(because he knew he had to poop,so he would not go outside) hed poop and same thing.         Took him to the vet,  he said he had colitis and gave the dog the shots he needed, along with meds.      He doesnt bleed anymore, but his poop is STILL really fat, and his poop doesnt hurt him anymore because he wont cry anymore....BUT, I guess hes somewhat traumatized from when he had it because hes scared to poop, holds it, but I take him outside and help him by talking to him, but the reason why I stay out there WATCHING him is because once the poop falls on the floor, hell eat the piece, and he started eating it when he was sick.      Its gross because if im not there hell eat EVERY piece that falls, and he still holds some of it in, even when he pooped he wont take all of it out.      I.E, Just 10 minutes ago I took him out, he started pooping no problem, Id stop him from eating the poop,but as soon as I turned my back for one second, and by the time I turned back I saw him eating the piece that had just fallen. I thought he was done because he didnt have the signs anymore of having to poop,then he came back inside and a tiny piece fell on the floor, and no porblem I picked it up. Like a minute later he comes in my room and drops this other giant piece of poop right next to my foot!      The poop is not hard, but not soft, been coming out like yellow brownish, really fat, he doesnt cry at all or anything. And I wonder why he takes such big poops because hes not that big of a dog, hes a mut, I dont know whats his mix. And he weighs 31 pounds.      WHY IS HE DOING THIS?      How can I make him stop eating his poop?!

I love my dog very very much, I've had him since I was 12/13 years old. He is about 13 years old, almost 14 & he recently got a respiratory infection. I have tried him on antibiotics. They helped for a couple days & than it came back. The vet gave me stronger antibiotics & they haven't done anything at all. He has now started coughing up blood.  He is still eating/drinking/pottying outside but he coughs every few minutes & he wheezes off and on. The vet said I need to start thinking about quality of life issues & I guess I just need someones objective opinion.  He has some hip problems that I give him pain med for but he seems to do ok with that.  I just can't tell if me not wanting to let him go is blinding me to what I need to do.  And I am educated, I previously worked in animal law enforcement so I know I don't want him to suffer. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you

20090307140305AAd5xAq	Pets;Horses	Rode my horse for the first time this year, and...?	and she was half and half for how good she was.   I have no video available.  It was too cold, and if we did tape it, then the video camera would freeze up.   She has been ridden around where I was riding before, she was a bit spooky at the picker (broken, crooked) she would look at it fine, but then as we walked away from it, she would either bolt, or stop dead in her tracks and do a turn to make sure it wasn't going to kill her.   She gets pretty herd-bound.   The worst parts were walking away from things that she would look at easily.  Such as...   A garbage bin   Picker   Shop   Truck   Trailer      Is this good for a first ride?   Should I do more work for the next ride, or the same amount of work?   Thanks in advance.

20090307151531AAF9cJF	Pets;Dogs	If you have two dogs, and one of them needs to be put to sleep...?	Is there a special way to go about that?       I have a two year old Shih Tzu and a 15 year old Golden Retriever. My Shih Tzu has adored my Golden since the second we took him home to meet him. I really believe in my heart that my Golden is ready to be put to sleep. I know it will break my Shih Tzu's heart, though. He looks up to my Golden, he plays with him hours a day, he completely adores him. I have an appointment with the vet on Monday, at which I honestly believe I will be instructed to put my Golden to sleep.       My question is, is there a special way to go about that with my little dog? Does he need to be with us when my Golden gets euthanized? Has anyone had a similar situation?       Any help or advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance. [And yes, I will talk to the vet about it on Monday. But, I would love some feedback or personal experiences first.]
20090307144039AAX0f8o	Pets;Dogs	Is my dog ready to be put to sleep?	I have a 15 year old Golden Retriever. He's had arthritis problems in his two front legs since he was about 7. I know that causes him a lot of pain. He doesn't sleep well at all during the night. All four of his legs are kicking all night, constantly, and he cries. I don't know if that is a seizure of some sort, or what... but it can't be comfortable for him at all. He can hardly see or hear anymore. You have to literally *scream* his name in order for him to hear it across the room. He's just in generally poor health. I love him with all of my heart, so I would hate to lose him, but I think I have been selfish for too long... and I just can't let him be in pain anymore. The only reservation I have is that he's still very playful. He loves his toys, he constantly plays with my other dog, he loves fetch... it just seems like he is too lively to be ready to... pass.       But, I have a couple questions...      First off, does it sound like he might be ready to be euthanized?      And, second, does anyone know if there is vet that will come to your house to put the animal to sleep? I don't want his last minutes spent in a vet clinic. He deserves to be at home.      And, since I know some answers are bound to be "go to a vet"... yes, I know, I plan to obviously. I just want some answers from other people first. Personal experiences. All that.       Thanks in advance.

I am watching her gums and they're ok.  This morning she seized again for about 30 seconds.  They said if she seizes again we'll have to hospitalize her and get a CT test done but I'm not sure I can afford it.  Please tell me what might be wrong and what to watch out for?

She is safe for tonight at my mom's house and she appears to be in season (I have two big male dogs of my own so couldnt keep her. No wonder they floored me when I got home after picking her up!) To be honest I would say she seems more pit bull like to me, but as they are not legal in the UK anymore I cannot be too sure. She is very friendly and well trained but looks a little underweight. She is a beautiful tan colour with distinctive white markings on the back of her neck and tail amongst other places. She was found in Birmingham. It unlikely that the owners will be on yahoo answers but I'm hoping that they can find this question by searching the internet for her. Please spread the word to anybody you know in the west midlands area and ask them to pass this info on to anyone they know. Somebody will be missing this lovely little girl.       Thank you

I had a rabbit before who lived for 7 years so I was really shocked when I found one of my new rabbits on her back dead this afternoon :(.      My question is, I'm worried about the other rabbit, will she be disturbed because her sister isn't there anymore? Or will she not be able to live on her own happily? I feel really sad for her because when I went out and found Rozi dead, Jazz (the other one) was licking the dead rabbit's head like she used to when she was alive. Do rabbits miss their siblings when they've been together for 2 years? Or does it not really effect them?

We answer truthfully because there is so much poor breeding and irresponsible ownership going on. Both of my pups come from champion lines and are showing to be excellent examples of their breed, however I would never consider breeding them unless I knew for fact I was bettering the breed. Why do people keep breeding and asking questions on here expecting to get support and nice answers when they are breeding to whatever and contributing to more mutts or unhealthy dogs in shelters. I just don't get it. If you have to ask a question on Y!A about breeding then you shouldn't be breeding.

20090307144725AANbGCv	Pets;Dogs	Did my dog get poisoned?	my dog is usually a very hyper and happy dog, but then out of nowhere she seemed all sad and depressed, everyday its getting worse, she wont eat, and when someone comes over to visit shes usually very excited and now she just lays down with her head on her paws and doesn't even wag her tail, i think she was poisoned because there has been a problem with a group of dogs running around our neighborhood and people are getting angry at the problems their causing. I cant get her into a vet untill monday, but im very worried about her. is their anything i should know or do for her untill then?      (she has been acting like this for about a week or so)
20090307140817AA5M3PB	Pets;Dogs	How long will my dog that just gave birth hate the daddy dog?	Well, my 2 year old dog just gave birth, and she is in a box with her 3 puppies, and every time the dad dog will come in the room she will hop out of the box and go after him.. He's now afraid to even go in that room. How long will this last?      The mom dog is also naturally mean, if something doesn't go her way she'll start growling at you, and eventually bite you. So i'm afraid, this whole attacking thing wont go away anytime soon..

20090307135220AAnIvK0	Pets;Dogs	I want to help this dog but I don't know what to do?	My boyfriend's mom is, well... a crackhead.  He doesn't live with her now, but she kept the poor dog.      They've had this dog for years, they found it so it was spayed when they got it.  She's really a beautiful, sweet dog. She hasn't been to the vet since they've had it, she isn't kept in a yard or anything.  She just runs around the street.  The parvo outbreak is bad around here (my sister wasn't allowed to put her healthy puppy on the vet's floor, it's that bad).  The street is pretty busy and everyone speeds down it.      She already managed to kill her male puppy, shortly after it impregnated the neighbor's dog.  He got hit and paralyzed, my sister found him.      I want to save her but I don't want to get caught, so should I call the pound?  She's more likely to be taken care of there. :/      I have very strong feelings about this, I just don't want to do the dog a disservice.
20090307151827AA41iOM	Pets;Dogs	Is my family lifestyle suitable to own a dog?	I really want a dog. Ive done tons of research and I babysit friends dogs a lot and I'm a total animal lover! My mom says she doesn't want a dog because she doesn't have the money and the time. But next year I switch into high school. The good thing is its legit 1 minute from our house. This summer I'm going to be earning 1k-5k. and the dogs at my local shelter cost around $150-$600. which include all shots and neutering and my mom' s fine with paying vet bills. So if my mom leaves the house around 8-9 o'clock and I get home at 2 o'clock is it humane to keep a dog that long in the house alone. Also what do you do when you go on vacation w/ your dog and what do you do when you get home late to feed your dog? Thank you =)

20090307152338AAZEdtl	Pets;Horses	Getting back into horseback riding?	I am really, really interested in getting back into horseback riding.   I was 11 years old when I started, I worked my way all the way up to a canter (barley) by the time I was 12.       I quit because I didn't like the stables where I was riding, because I was really young and scared to canter, plus the lessons were too high priced for my family to afford.       I am almost 17 years old now, and I would absolutely love to get back into riding. My question is, how do you think would be the best way to go about it? Also, what is the usual price for an hour lesson? So I can find a good priced stable to start taking lessons at.      Thank you for all of your help, in advance. :]
20090307142812AADAqnz	Pets;Fish	Am i treating Ich properly? (heat/salt)?	mkay well i have a 2.5 inch tiger oscar and a 2 inch pleco in my 10 gallon aquarium and i noticed tiny white sspots on my oscar, so i did some research and came to the conclusion that is Ich. I DO NOT want to treat with meds as i hear there hard on the fish as well as the Ich. So what i've been doing (since last night) has been doing daily 35% water changes (i would do more but i had to leave room for the filter to "waterfall" into the tank for aeration and if i take out any more water the filter will like not get enough water so i do as much as i can.) and i add 1 teaspoon per gallon of water of aquarium salt. i have also turned the heat in my tank to 86 degrees F, is this all i need to do for 14days to get rid of the ich? or am i doing somthing wrong? please let me know from your expierences using salt and heat. I know about coppersafe and all that crap i just don't want to injure my pleco, so im only going to use meds if i HAVEE to. thanx for your replys guys, oh and i use the water conditioner to.

20090307140058AAA2Tv4	Pets;Dogs	Were dogs bred to be stupid?	I've noticed dogs do a lot of stupid things.  They chew on open wounds for one thing, which can lead to infection and even death.  They are pretty much the only animals that will eat themselves sick.  And they apparently can't differentiate between food and harmful material.  Are wolves like this too?  I would think such self destructive traits would have been bred out of them by natural selection.  Did dogs acquire all these stupid habits as they were domesticated?

20090307154616AABse4U	Pets;Horses	Saddle for Paint/Tb cross!?	I'm looking for a dressage saddle for my horse. He is about 16hh and about 950-1000lbs. I currently have an all purpose that is 18", narrow/medium tree, and about a 4-5" gullet. It almost fits him-but it is a little too narrow and the gullet sits very nearly on his spine. He has a short back and loonng withers. I'm planning on trying a few 16.5" saddles, medium width, and a 5-6" gullet on him. Does this sound okay-any opinions? I would prefer to buy a saddle that fits him without a wither riser-but I also ahve to buy used. Any helpful opinions would be much appreciated.

20090307153544AAtualg	Pets;Horses	Older Horse...should I consider senior equine?	We adopted a 24 to 26 year old Quarter Horse in September.  He was approximately 400 pounds underweight (could see his ribs, hip bones, etc.), rain rot the whole nine yards.  We've gone with the vet's suggestion of 12% sweet feed, and good hay.  He has gained most of it back, but he looks like he is still lacking about 100 to 125 pounds.      Should we now consider Senior Equine, or am I just being impatient?  He has had a great appetite since we adopted him (thank goodness).      Any suggestions?
