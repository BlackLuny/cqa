B5xrYsuxaa	i doubt you will find much sympathy with the average person, if you are paying almost a mil each year in taxes i dont even wanna know how many mils you net per year..i personally dont mind paying taxes, i like having things like schools and roads etc. Im just not too keen on how our taxes have been spent lately|`|vSRhp7zxaa	If the information in this letter is accurate, your 2009 annual income will be about $2.5 million, and you expect to earn all of this income in the form of wages, tips, and other compensation.<br>  <br>  Unless you're a CEO of a Fortune 500 company, this is a very unlikely scenario.  Lots of people make $2.5 million/year, but almost all of them earn their money through a share of the profits of some company, not in the form of salary.  <br>  <br>  Moreover, if you are earning $2.5 million from an employer, and having zero withheld (which is what the letter says), your employer screwed up royally.  Employers don't forget to withhold a percentage of income on employees who earn $2.5 million/year.<br>  <br>  All this adds up to one of two things:  either you're a colossal tax cheat, or the IRS made a colossal error.  <br>  <br>  Either way, you need to get on the phone to your local IRS office.  You may also need an attorney.|`|fQmFeWPhaa	You shouldn't be upset because you know it's gonna be spent in your own country and not in Iraq.|`|sv4guUQNaa	You must be Bernie Maddoff or they made some type of data entry error|`|1FkYHLXDaa	I'd really like to see a letter from the IRS telling you how to avoid taxes. Maybe from an accountant, highly unlikely from the IRS.<br>  <br>  Also, if you were making that kind of money, you would no doubt have an accountant who would advise you to pay in quarterly.<br>  <br>  In addition, why in the hell would you be claiming any exemptions with that kind of income? Usually you would be claiming negative exemptions. <br>  <br>  This sounds a bit fishy to me.|`|Q7ovix19aa	Everybody should be upset.

vFCxdraNaa	Personally I am against the Stimulus for various reasons. <br>  <br>  Initially President Obama and the senate have passed multi billion dollar stimulus aid to assist companies that have poorly managed their finances. It is the American taxpayers who are bailing out these companies. Many Americans do not realize that we will be heavily taxed for many generations for programs that will not benefit the average American. Personally I think the multi billion dollar stimulus package could have been put to better use. I believe the money should have been spent on educating an aging workforce on green technology.<br>  <br>  America would be better off if the companies and banks filed for bankruptcy. This would allow for the companies to be responsible for their financial situation and not the American taxpayers. Also it would have allowed for new companies to be established under new regulations.|`|pZSZUhXNaa	everytime obabma signs a plan of anything, the stock market tanks !!|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Against.<br>  <br>  It will only devalue the currency.<br>  <br>  Gold is up $50/oz in the 1 week since the bill was passed.|`|xhpAiWPvaa	Against dont you think each city should get a letter stating how much that city has paid in taxes <br>  and citizens of those cities should figure out whats important to them and vote on ways to spend it

I would rather it go to Palestinians now.|`|dCewrtXaaa	Hogwash. It is a huge leap and utterly absurd to interpret from the inclusion of a few "Palestinian refugees and Gaza conflict victims" among other humanitarian aid, that the President supposedly authorized, as you put it, "hundreds of thousands of Palestinians loyal to Hamas to resettle in the US at American taxpayer expense." Either you are a gullible pawn of ill-intentioned propagandists, or you are one yourself.

BLMh0dG6aa	I went online and couldn't find anything one the wili... online encyclopedia, but I didn't finish either the article of Palestinian or Israel;<br>  <br>  As I understand it, the state set aside for the Palestinians was taken by Syria, without permission.<br>  <br>  I've never gotten a response from here or on Obama's question sites (which no longer exist as such) to why, if true, we didn't try to get them to give it back.<br>  <br>  Which is why I feel Israel's going to Syria now is a step in the right direction.|`|XpUF9f1Saa	Back in the 50's, Palestine was part of Jordan, and there was no Isreal.

2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	Maybe,,,gold  goes up in price when the dollar goes down in value. Because of inflation.<br>  <br>  Because gold is more stable, and it takes more devalued dollars to buy the same amount of gold.<br>  <br>  Also when more people fear the devalued dollar and buy more gold, the price goes up from higher demand.
7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Yes they are. And as usual, they are getting a pass on it. There's "peaceful protest" and then there is ACORN. There is nothing peaceful about them. They take everything by force in the name of discrimination. They are nothing more than a ground force designed to intimidate businesses into doing as they say. The Community Reinvestment Act unfortunately gives them a little legal backing. However, what they are doing now isn't defendable in any way.|`|zjpB2GARaa	It doesn't sound like they are training people for "civil disobedience."  It sounds to me like they are training people to commit violent crime, which shouldn't surprise anybody, considering that ACORN is the political arm of the gangbangers and thugs that make up most of the population of our inner cities.|`|U50orfPhaa	WOW!  This is ACORNS FAULT!   They are the ones who traveled around getting these loans for people!  With Fannie and Freddie Mac.  This must be a set up, it was probably Obamas plan all along.

There are several other methods that have been used in the past that I can see making a comeback.  <br>  <br>  When all these foreclosures are sitting empty, in many cases it is legal to occupy the property, (squatting) and pay the tax on it.  After a certain amount of time the squatter can then claim the deed.  <br>  <br>  If the banks can't tell where their mortgages had been sold to, how can they keep track of the tax payments?|`|r5orGVwoaa	It's early yet,,just wait till the rest of the country hears about it.

k3ZVZmBJaa	Like a lot of others have said, the scenario is extremely unlikely.  But to answer your question:  1).  Special forces and CIA would infiltrate Iran to target important sites to be destroyed, round up opposition to Iran gov't 2) the US would first bomb (stealth and ship-based munitions) the hell out of important radar sites, SAM missle defense sites, and anything that would hurt their war fighting ability with the help of ground laser targeting from special forces, combat controllers, CIA <br>  <br>  3) the US would establish air superiority and make sure that they control the skies.  US fighters along with British and Israeli would pretty much establish that very quickly.  <br>  4).  Ground invasion would go through Iraq, no other Middle east countries are likely to allow US/allies to use their bases or land. <br>   5).  The ground invasion, with air support, would be quick and mobile.  Essential targets would need to be captured or destroyed very quickly.  Iran armor would not be much of a match for the US/allies, but they do have a fairly large group of infantry forces.  <br>  6).  Much like Iraq, ground force would need to get to capital and eliminate, as much as possible, the head of the government.  <br>  7).  Sea power could also be established once Iranian missle sites on the gulf are taken out by ground and air forces.   <br>  <br>  Once Iran is defeated, the US would face a choice as to whether or not to try nation-building again or if they would just allow Iranian citizens to fill the power vacuum.  Probably, some sort of US-backed government would be attempted, but the same problems of Iraq would rise up.  Too costly and too may US/allies lives would be lost during the post-war insurgency.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	Nato has nothing to do with Iran. It is the North Atlantic treaty, Europen Countries. <br>  Only a skilled military tactitian could suggest ways to invade Iran, but this will never happen for political reasons.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	Well, we have bases in Afghanistan, Iraq and Kyrgistan, and we'd have an ally in Israel.  NATO probably wouldn't want to get involved at any significant level.  <br>  <br>  It would start with massive airstrikes, aiming for Iranian airports, air bases and anti-aircraft installations.  That would go on for maybe a month, and would completely remove Iran's airpower.  Also during these strikes, all of Iran's nuclear facilities would be destroyed.  And I mean all of them.  That would be the primary objective of the whole conflict.  <br>  <br>  The only reason we'd actually commit ground troops to Iran is if our secondary objective was to remoe Admenejad and the Ayatolah from power (certainly a worthy goal, as they are insane.)  I don't really see that happening any time in the forseeable future, but if it did, we'd probably come in across the Iraqi border.  <br>  <br>  Taking Tehran would be problematic.  The US military has the raw power to reduce Iran to glass, but it is always hesitant of the political backlash of using anywhere close to its full strength.  However, Tehran is the second largest city in the middle east by population.  Urban warfare there would be a nightmare.  There are also four or five other cities with a population of over 750,000.  All hard to take and difficult to hold afterward.<br>  <br>  Invading Iran, disposing of the government, and then "nation  building" a stable democracy afterward would take - minimum - five years and probably more like ten.  At a cost of ten billion dollars per month if Iraq is a good gauge.  The simple truth is that the United States cannot afford a war of that magnitude right now.  Iran knows it, that is why they've been so bold of late.<br>  <br>  But the US - and Israel - can easily afford an air campaign, for which Iran has effectively no defense.  Their nuclear ambitions can only end in the destruction of their facilities, and they are just taking money away from where it should be spent, in improving the day to day lives of the Iranian people.|`|E9yH3tWMaa	Mainly from the land that the Americans have occupied in the last few years. ie Iraq in the West and Afghanistan in the East. It is unlikely that Pakistan and Turkey would cooperate but Saudi would be under pressure to allow the US to use their air bases against Iran.<br>  <br>  I think it is unlikely to happen as there must be the thought at the back of any American president's mind that Iran has already placed biological 'sleepers' in the US.|`|AA10652652	Iran is surrounded by U.S. forces.  To the west there are forces in Iraq.  To the East, there are U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  The U.S. navy is also in the gulf.  Chances are the U.S. would destroy Iran's real command structure referred to as "the mullahs" by the U.S.  There would be air strikes against Iran's military and supply lines.  I doubt the U.S. would hold cities like they did in Iraq, because Iran's population is larger.  The U.S. could control how Iran gets its water, which would cause Iranians to migrate to water sources inside Iran.  Eventually Iran would turn into a failed state and then the U.S. could go in and divide and conquer.|`|lrS8UXnYaa	Never happen Russia would not allow it. Israel could not defeat Iran. They will argue all day long about Iranian nuclear weapons but even if they get the weapon they wont use it.|`|nxEoR9CEaa	With reports of Iran in the process of building a nuclear weapon, NATO will not have to invade.  Israel will do it on their own.  Iran is a growing and immanent threat to Israel.  Israel has the weapons and the military strength to remove Iran from the map.  Iran has stated that will will launch a nuclear weapon against Israel.  Israel will not allow that to happen.  Israel will strike first, and destroy Iran's capability to produce any type of weapon.|`|VeWD8Io2aa	Why would we want to? Kuwait and Saudi i could see for oil, and Iraq because Saddam was being a butthead, but Iran isn't an oil rich nation. There's no natural resource or strategic value in it and although some anti-war types disagree, historically and even now, America has never been a "invade the hell out of them and steal their land" type of country.|`|XNFvoIGxaa	Saddam had to be ousted. Even some of his relatives (Husseins rule most of the middle East) wanted him out. He was a despot. He was dangerous to the Hussein family. Iran, formerly known as persia is as holy as Mecca. Invade Iran without them making a move first would bring the middle East crashing down on the invaders.<br>  Before you invaded Persia, you'd have to have full and utmost support from Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The only way you'd get that is if Iran really upset them first.|`|MTF0Rz90aa	First of they won't, if they did it would be a massive mistake.<br>  If they did then more than likely the first strike would be carried out by Israel, taking out specific targets in Iran.<br>  The response from Iran would be swift and devastating "Dragging" the US into a war. This would then result in an aerial bombardment followed by a sea based invasion from Iraq.<br>  Ja.|`|bdb0448285000d5895d1e8ed364a94fbaa	I hope they wouldn't even contemplate the idea at any serious level.|`|wgAQK2GNaa	They wouldn't.
zLUQJxJkaa	Well the reason is because US Marines have the highest sense of camaraderie and "gung-ho" about them. They have a LOT of pride in their Corps, and country. We like them because they show the highest degree of patriotism. Army does it, SEALs do it, but Marines just go all out on it.<br>  It's a deeper warrior spirit that they have, something that sets them apart from other services. It's the same kind of thing that sets America apart from other countries. There is a special will, some kind of inner patriotism that Americans find. It happened after 9/11, a will to band together and fight through it no matter what. Americans are best at that and the USMC reflect that.|`|bDmBOwNRaa	The guy above who said that the USMC is more patriotic that all other services is wrong.  USMC is known for their eccentric chain of command and the way they do their daily business.  Plus, the marine have special mission that other services don't perform.  For example, they guard embassies.  Not to mention the their famous uniform.|`|uurgL3oZaa	The ones who love the Marines the most are the Marines themselves.

l4pVsxoraa	Once your hubby finishes his initial training which consists of basic recruit training (about 13 weeks) and his basic trades training (anywhere up to a year or so depending on his trade) If the trades course is a long one (over 6 months)  you'd be able to join him.  After he finishes his trades course, he'll be posted to a base or unit.  Once he's been posted to that unit you would live a relatively normal life.  Depending upon the trade he is assigned he may or may not be away a fair bit of time but he will be home more than he's away.   Most deployments are six months in duration and he may do two, three or four of those over a 20 year career.    Airforce trades generally tend to do less deployments than the army.   The army is scheduled to cease combat operations in Afghanistan by 2011 which means that soldiers will likely be around home much more than they have been over the past few years.   I served in the navy for 26 years, spending about 10 of those years aboard ship (I was lucky) Over the 10 years I was aboard ship I was probably away from home somewhere between 3 and 4 years.  Six week trips, 8 week trips the occasional 3 month trip and twice for six months.   <br>  <br>  Being the wife of a military man will bring you many challenges but also many rewards.   When he's away you'll have to be both mom and dad to the kids.  6am at the rink for hockey practice, School issues, health issues financial issues will all fall upon your shoulders if he's away.  But if he stays in long enough you will live in several different place, meet and make lifelong friends.   I was married when I had three years in the service.  My wife shouldered much of the responsibility for raising two fine sons, both of whom are now grown men and who bring me great pride and joy.  My younger son decided to follow in the old man's footsteps and has been in the navy for about seven years now.  He's married and they expecting our first grandchild this coming summer.   <br>  <br>  It's not the easiest lifestyle in the world but it's a lot better than many others.  If he is serious about a military career, give it a try, you might find the lifestyle to your liking and he'll be entering the honourable profession of service to our country.   If we could do it all over again I know both my wife and I wouldn't change a thing.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both.

The only reason why Obama won the Presidency anyway was because 1) McCain isn't a true Republican let alone a Conservative, 2) as a result, ~10 Million Conservatives stayed home that day.... <br>  <br>  Racism is only stood up by those that keep claiming (illegitimately) that they are being discriminated against for the color of their skin... <br>  <br>  Republicans can't seem to do anything with out being labeled as Racist...

Republicans don't like to promote or elect people based on the color of their skin as they do on the content of their character... Martin Luther King, Jr. said something to this effect I believe....<br>  <br>  Not everything the Republicans do to Critizes Obama and his people are done for the sake of being racist..... From 2000-2006 Dems had every right to dissent against the Republican Government... Now it's our turn... if you don't like it then you can go somewhere else... I didn't complain when lib Dem's dipicted my electorate as a monkey.... I don't complain when they dipict my State as a bunch of ignoramuses... why?

c40692e8f41f1f9fcd1571bce1ccb576aa	India is second fastest growing economy in the world after China but the benefit of growth is not reaching to the lower level. No doubt, population is much more, illiteracy is also there but corruption and lack of will power among the people to work for the country is there. Inefficiency  in the offices and industries is there. <br>  Corruption is high at political level. Prosecution in the courts is a lengthy process due to pending cases. In order to control corruption, a few states have a constitutional post of “Lok Auykta” but he has not been given enough power to check. Bill to create the post of “Lok Pal” is pending since the time of Rajveev Gandi in Lok Sabha, who would  enquire into the corruption cases of the  Politicians and the officers at Central  level but  no political party wish to bring any such legislation. It takes them only a minute to pass the bill for the increase in their salary and benefits but they are not interested to create the post of “Lok Pal” to check corruption cases against them.<br>  There may be a number of reasons for the slow growth but in my view corruption, and lack of felling to work for the country and selfishness are the main reason.

But yes it is slower than what it could have been if the problems of population,illiteracy and corruption wouldn't have been there.<br>  <br>  The answer to this question requires the basic understanding of the fact that the three problems you have mentioned are inter -related. one paves way for the other.<br>  <br>  for example..<br>  <br>  If the population is large than the benefits of economic development could not be distributed to each member of the country. This leads to economic imbalance. So a large section of society does not have enough resources to meet the basic demands of food and shelter leave aside education. Thus a large population gives rise to illiteracy.<br>  <br>  Also illiterate people do not adopt measures of family planning and hence illiteracy gives rise to a large population.<br>  <br>  Also when economic benefits are unevenly distributed it gives rise to corruption where people want to accumulate money by all means.<br>  <br>  hence all the three problems you mentioned are intertwined.|`|cwlMelktaa	the main reason for slow development of India is corruption.but also it is introspect .it is true that india is a poor country but this is in progress because of corruption.|`|b97265f152955d6ab942a1e58cd2fde7aa	The mother of all the probelms is "Population"<br>  <br>  Poverty, illeteracy and corruption are her children

Here, I got you the site.  <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100days/2009/02/20/transportation-chief-considers-taxing-miles-driven/" rel="nofollow">http://www.foxnews.com/politics/first100...</a>  And it's from your very own network!<br>  2.  Obama's health care plan has never been nor is it now, socialist.  You retain all control over your medical care.  The government encourages competition, which is by the way necessary since there are currently only about 4 insurance companies giving coverage.  How do you think that affects the price?<br>  3.  Here is the truth of the "fundamental flaw" comment.  "In a preceding portion of the WBEZ program -- titled "Slavery and the Constitution" -- Obama explained that the "fundamental flaw" was that "[t]he Africans at the time were not considered as part of the polity that was of concern to the framers," and that the framers did not "see[] it as a moral problem involving persons of moral worth." Without airing that part of the WBEZ program, in which Obama explained his position that the Constitution reflected the "fundamental flaw of this country."  So you're saying that rejecting the racial prejudice of the original Constitution makes him an anti-Constitutionalist?<br>  4.  Here is the site on the VOLUNTARY service plan Obama proposes.  <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/issues/service/#enable-americans" rel="nofollow">http://www.barackobama.com/issues/servic...</a>  Got one to say it will be mandatory?<br>  <br>  That's all I'm going to answer at this time.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped you!

He hasn't done this and many other far left things so he's making the left mad, however he has also closed guantanamo without any plans of where to put the terrorists and passed a huge spending bill so he is still catering to the far left.

In response: His approval rating has everything to do with our confidence in his decision making which is in the bowels of relative presidents. I do not have a personal problem with him, but I do have a problem with his ambiguous definition of who falls under Habeas Corpus ("unlawful military combatants,") especially when our country was not in direct danger when he did it.<br>  <br>  Oh yes, and one more thing: Liberals do not consider the suspension of Habeas Corpus the "war crimes" you discuss. I think they are referring to torture.

Many have never held any type of job, they haven't even been made to clean their rooms.  That sounds silly but time is wasted inspecting dorms that are filthy and the members have no responsibility in maintaining them.  They also have trouble with authority figures and don't follow orders.  They were never made to listen at home and they don't want to listen in the military.<br>  <br>  It's not all their fault.  It's the parents who raised them with this sense of entitlement.  To expect something for nothing.  They have no idea of the relationship between hard work and reward.  <br>  <br>  Add to this, the Democrats' policy of cutting defense spending whenever they are in office and we end up being unprepared for attacks.<br>  <br>  Edit:  The poster who said one problem is the reason people are joining is true.  Too many are joining because they can't get any other job, had children they can't support, or have no skills.

You didn't claim sexism then? Why?|`|AA10124869	One would have to be a complete flippin' MORON to associate that cartoon with a racially insensitive stab at Obama. And, WHY might we ask??<br>  <br>  Well for starters...<br>  <br>  The president doesn't write legislation. That's the job of Congress. That then said, if you can't refer to all the members of Congress as being a bunch of chimps (because chimp is somehow a racist term), then what the hell is Eric Holder talking about that we as Americans are cowards on the subject of race??<br>  <br>  Secondly, Bush was routinely associated with being a chimp. So I'd say that even if the cartoon WAS referring to Obama, what's good for the goose is good for the gander am I right??|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	I don't think it's racist...it's just a bad cartoon...not really funny....for a number of reasons that have nothing to do with race....and no, I don't think Obama's comment was sexist...I think everyone in this country, republicans and democrats alike....need to take a collective chill pill.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	People will say what they say.

If its not, then you might want to invest a bit of money having a solicitor draw one up if you and your neighbor can come to terms.  A lot of insurance companies will offer liability policies over these types of "common area" living spaces, so you might want to check into that.  Naturally, a suit over a person injured in the drive could get pricey in a hurry.

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	I have legitimate discussions with reasonable people all the time regarding politics. However, if you are looking for legitimate discussion on Yahoo Answers with any group, they are few and far between. This site is loaded with hyperbole and innuendo. Knowing the history of some of your questions and answers you should really not be throwing stones at others in regard to engaging in logical discussions. Simple thought.

Hq6nSl1Qaa	In other developed countries, you don't have to lose your entire life saving, your home, and go on welfare because a child gets sick or you get in a car accident.<br>  <br>  This year "health care" cost my family $11,500 in deferred compensation, $1,500 in deductible, and $980 in doctor and medication co-pays.<br>  <br>  Last year my sister's HMO finally used the proper diagnostic tool to evaluate what was wrong after her C-section.  Until that point, they drug out the issue with what they thought would be "cheaper" remedies.  She missed a total of 4 months of work over two years - not paid.  In the end, the desire to save money cost the HMO $106,460 to fix the issue between repeated doctor visits, low quality scans, medications, etc etc.  Of that, the final remedy cost $18,400 including one scan, one corrective surgery, post-op hospital, and medications.<br>  <br>  In 2007, investments in that HMO paid out 18% return to investors on Wall Street.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of powerful interests that will fight with their last tooth and nail to keep that gravy train rolling.  These are some of the same 6 people that control 95% of the media in this country.<br>  <br>  Canada has a lower infant mortality rate, a lower maternal mortality rate, and if a doctor believe something is urgent, you're done within 48 hours.  I'm sure my sister, who couldn't run and who had pain when she walked upright for two years, would have appreciated that level of timeliness without being unproductive to the US economy for 4 months and her family for 2 years.<br>  <br>  So, overall I'm going to have to go with "superior."|`|QR5HbJQ0aa	I think we should have Universal Health care.

BTW Bill Clinton's stand on most business issues were more Republican than Democratic.|`|55NKPb82aa	Who ever told the banks to give risky loans to unqualified individuals|`|ErTVzpUUaa	I blame the Dem. run congress and senate, things have been going downhill ever since!|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	the federal reserve|`|3sSOq8FKaa	the housing market|`|5ff6c450a0786035aba431374bf6fc0aaa	Bill Clinton.<br>  <br>  They blame him for pretty much everything that's gone wrong on their watch.|`|AA11424005	Obama|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	I personally blame the excessive regulation that prevents the free market from operating correctly.<br>  <br>  Most of this excessive regulation is put in place intentionally to prevent failing businesses and industries from failing... That is about as good of an idea as building a giant dam out of paper. Instead of letting a little water through all the time you hold all the water back until the paper soaks through, then all hell breaks loose. The Democrat model of dam building to "stem job loss" has been shown to be a disaster so why do we keep using it?<br>  <br>  The answer: Because the Union bosses (i.e. the modern mobsters) run the Democrat Party through donations and votes.|`|uKJ5lRMoaa	Well, lets look at what precipitated these conditions.  Many well trained economists would agree that the collapse of the housing market was a large contributor to the start of this.  <br>  <br>  Why did the housing market collapse?  Again many economist agree that poor/risky lending practices started this.  <br>  <br>  Who was pushing and encouraging poor lending practices?  Democrats.  The Democrat leadership cried that it wasn't fair that not everyone can afford a house.  They forced banks to make risky loans to people that could not afford them.  When people couldn't afford their payments when their variable rate went up lost their homes.  Too many foreclosures caused a flood to the market and prices collapsed.  <br>  <br>  Who from the beginning said that pushing these risky loans so that "everyone" gets a chance at "the American Dream"?  Republicans.|`|uGMeA5Duaa	The Americans people of course. FACT: More Americans are saving money now instead of spending it. FACT: Americans spent 6% more than their earning a year for the past eight years. FACT: Americans not spending money causes the economy to fail. Which causes job loss in turn causing people not to be able to pay bills which causes people to lose homes. Americans have lived above their means and now we as a whole are paying for it. FACT spending less and Saving more is bad for the American economy.<br>  In Addition: We (the people) buy a lot of products from overseas. We hire illegal immigrants who in turn send money they make back to their family's from their home country. We buy more non-American made than American made. You know it's sad when you see an American Flag that was Made In China.  Placing blame on one person or one political group is not going to the fix the problem.|`|VS0PuI5paa	Obama for fanning the flames and pouring gasoline on it.

TBIAIAcnaa	You have explained it very accurately.<br>  Your few words are what the media has filled up pages and pages of newspapers trying to say.|`|tvNkizDraa	In a sense, yes it is.  The first half of that bailout has already been spent and it did not unfreeze the credit market so it did not help to stem the foreclosures, which in turn are decreasing property values and eroding the  local tax revenues that pay for schools, essential services (police, fire protection), etc.  Basically, the money was funneled to the top and did not 'trickle down' to the root problems.  So now, the second half is supposed to go towards rewriting loans to hopefully stem the tide of foreclosures.  Will it work?  I have no idea, but I do think that it stands a better chance of solving the local community problems than the first half did by going towards retreats, CEO bonuses and dividends.  Here's an interesting article about this bailout culture. <br>  <a href="http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/moral-hazard/2008/09/19/what-moral-hazard?page=0,1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/mora...</a>|`|de5bda1b9dad2b1e94d22f6f86adf6beaa	The same people who want are the same people who wanted people who shouldn't have the loans buy houses bigger than they can afford.<br>  Like Obama and those who thought Fannie Mae and Freddi Mac was the way to go.<br>  <br>  They pushed the junk loans.<br>  <br>  Now we all have to pay for it.|`|BpcgaJd4aa	That's exactly what it is. Just another bailout for the banks and mortgage companies.
OfNTLq3Qaa	This country is going to hell via the express lane.|`|W0VL46gDaa	It's really not funny at all...<br>  <br>  It's quite sad.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	No?  That's pretty funny actually.  Obama gets much better press...<br>  <br>  Perhaps this country is a lot less "Christian" than some think.|`|VK0brk89aa	That is funny those statistics come out as I just heard on the news that if Jesus spent $1 million a day it wouldn't be as much as Obama just spent in his Stimulus Package. <br>  <br>  I think that the Liberal Left needs to stop propping up Obama and telling tales. The higher they keep making false stats the harder Obama is going to fall. <br>  <br>  Obama's first few weeks in office haven't been anything to write home about.|`|PJLmAnTbaa	It isn't funny. It is a pathetic testament to the apathy of the American People. This country, that our forefathers created with basic Judeo-Christian principles, has turned into Gomorrah.<br>  <br>  While I am not overly religious, I do find this attitude of my fellow citizens to be slightly alarming.|`|CpTQagJOaa	not funny at all.|`|pM81f5tnaa	Well yeah.  But to put it in perspective, "those surveyed were not shown a list of people to choose from."   They were asked whom they admired enough to call them "heroes." I'll bet if this had been a multiple choice question, Christians would have put "Jesus" at the top.  (Of course, that would not be the case for non-Christian Americans.)|`|spuz7DvNaa	Hey Hitler did too!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I know liberals with their groupie mentality would never get it but this is the frenzied abnormal worship that put people like Hitler in power. Daily we see liberals taking away rights and imposing big brother. Liberals will bring this country to disaster.|`|hdenI2h6aa	This shows you how off course the American people really are.  Blinded sheep following a false prophet...Obama has duped them all.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Oh wow. And people wonder WHY we in addition to laughing hysterically at Louis F.'s statement that he is the Messiah point out that he is worshipped like a deity. Now ya know!|`|TBIAIAcnaa	Only an American opinion, not a global opinion. This is exactly why the world doesn't trust America|`|eUdBD4tPaa	I think it's really pathetic.  What a commentary on this nation.|`|de5bda1b9dad2b1e94d22f6f86adf6beaa	I know our society was in trouble but this poll proves it.<br>  The Savior of the world is over that of a man who hasn't done squat.<br>  <br>  We are trouble people.|`|KcAehrrKaa	Not funny|`|ZqA7qDWAaa	All these Obama supporters are still refusing to believe just how ignorant he, and his idea's are. Cheer up my fellow American's time is on our side on all this man's stupidity.<br>  The stock market has fallen faster after his spending bill was announced than it did to cause this mess.<br>  Seems as if it falls even more every time every time this idiot announces another spending plan.<br>  Nobody with money is trusting this fool's foolish idea's. Can't say I blame them.<br>  Did these socialist that are supporting this socialist idea's even realize just how big this spending bill is. If we spent one million dollars for every day since our Lord Jesus Christ was born we would not spend the amount that's in this bill.|`|593f5a959e494d93b72266dbf2f2bd3faa	both are very scary|`|2CO7pPdoaa	he's a false prophet..BEWARE!!|`|ErTVzpUUaa	It's sad and disgusting, to say the least!

1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Because it's an ineffective use of plant.<br>  <br>  There is fixed overhead in your facilities, whether you're using them or not. It's best to have someone in there at all times working.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Many companies already do this--often.  However, working on Mon., Wed., and Fri., is extremely inefficient.  The days need to be consecutive.  Starting up a line or process takes time.  Especially when the machinery needs to be heated or the job has multiple processes.  Once you get a line running, you don't want to shut it down unless you have to.<br>  <br>  Alternate the use of a plant?  I like the fact that you're trying to come up with ideas but it would help if you had worked in the field of manufacturing.  Companies do not lease more square footage than they need (why pay taxes on footage that isn't necessary?).  Manufacturing has been streamlined and every inch of space is already being used.  The last place that I worked had lines too close together--one of the emergency exit routes was only two feet wide and between machines that were 350 degrees.  Machinery takes room and many times it needs large cranes to move.  I have never worked for a company where such a thing would be remotely feasible.  If a line isn't running, you do not go in and move tons of equipment (that usually needs to be bolted to the floors).  If I have an extrusion line that makes vinyl fencing, that equipment is not capable of making weatherstripping.  If I have an injection mold machine that makes bumpers (the one I worked on was about 15'W X 15'D X 12' H), that machine is not capable of working a die to make a child's sled.  Dies and tooling are machined according to the particular process and formula of the material to be used in them.  With two different companies, shipping and receiving would be a nightmare.  Each type of business has different OSHA standards.|`|UZBULUuraa	Mainly because when a company lays someone off they have no obligation to pay them or give them benefits. A shorter work week for all the workers won't save the company the cost of benefits which is an expense they would need to cut to make money.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	TONS of companies do this.  They eliminate Overtime, then regular hours then layoffs.  THats generally the way it works.  My company is getting by by cutting overtime.|`|8NphFD9maa	This is a great idea, it should be considered.
vKR4tysjaa	Hey gigg, isn't it funny how Libs like "intellect" above me says he ONLY deals in facts, then goes on to spew forth generalizations about Fox news causing the stimulus package to fail...ROFL.  Typical lib.<br>  <br>  Hey intilifck, Do they have Fox news in Venezuela?  How's that working out for you socialist thugs?  I'm guessing Castro doesn't let his beloved people watch Fox either, kind of like how China allows their civilians the opportunity to watch anything they like, after it's been filtered by the State.

xxDjV6Axaa	I so agree with you!!!  I faced quite a bit of adversity myself but I sacrificed and built up my businesses from scratch.  I too, worked 80 hours a week to get those up and running.  That was when I started the businesses.  Now I do work less than 20 hours a week but that is absurd to think you start out that way.<br>  <br>  I even saw one poster say we should give our money because some people are just not motivated and it's not their fault!!!  Of course it is their fault.  Poor people are poor because they want to be.  They claim that it was bad luck or something else but if you live in the US and are a citizen then you have the same opportunities that you and I have had.  If you fail to take advantage of them and work hard, it is nobody's fault but your own.<br>  <br>  I think there is a huge misconception that most rich people inherited that money.  Only a very small number of people inherit.  The rest earned the money.  And even those who inherit, have a family member who did work hard and earned it.<br>  <br>  Props!  I am so sick of hearing whiners complain that they have nothing.  No food but they are on the computer and obviously have internet.  They just don't know how to set priorities but I am not about to hand over my money to lazy people.  I donate to the charities of MY choice!<br>  <br>  Mean spirited???

They are working class. If you work for a living then you have very little in common with those people who have sufficient wealth that they can be confident their future will never hold hunger, never hold temporarily sleeping on a friends sofa while they look for houseing, never hold worrying about their kids being cold and having no coats. But you do have a lot in common with people who DO live those fears, whether those people are on welfare, in low paying jobs, or working for a substantial income.<br>  <br>  If you think it's a good thing for people like you to pay high taxes that subsidize huge tax breaks for people who need never work unless they choose to, then you keep deluding yourself that you have common interests with these people.

That's why Al Gore tells us we'll all die in ten years if we don't combat Global Warming immediately while he flies around in the most fuel guzzling jet in the skies.  But, "do as I say, not as I do".|`|V6aH1vpQaa	Liberalism is simple.  At its core it is the belief that all men are equal.  As such, liberals don't like unearned wealth (like trust fund yuppies, bankers who pay themselves millions even though they tanked their banks, or crony capitalists who hire their friends to be on the board of directors).  It also means that gays, blacks, yellow etc. deserve the same opportunites as everyone else.  It means we shouldn't invade non-threatening countries and kill thousands just for giggles.  And finally, it means that we should treat the lowliest in society with compassion and kindness.  Kinda like Jesus was a liberal.|`|AA10595128	Actually, true liberals say things (and write things) like the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. I believe you are confusing liberals with "progressives" and neo-socialists. <br>  <br>  If you want to read some things that a true liberal said, Google "Thomas Jefferson quotes"|`|VelE30y7aa	LIBERALISM:  You have two cows. You sell both to the rich. The government then taxes the rich one cow and gives it to the poor.|`|Xi5Jno6haa	The best way I can explain it is...Liberals replaced God with Government! Instead of looking to God for guidance they look to their government to lead them!|`|ErTVzpUUaa	Look socialism up, same thing!|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	I think you're onto something there.  The key to liberalism is having someone besides yourself to blame for your problems and then expecting someone else (usually the government) to fix them for you.  That way, you can avoid having any personal accountability, which is uncomfortable and icky.|`|HZ9YfIMOaa	It's impossible to understand it, even liberals don't know what it is.

There's no problem in people being rich, it's just people are suffering. Have you even tried being part of the opposite end? You will never truly understand it|`|Hq6nSl1Qaa	Well, ask the most famous liberal of all time, Jesus.<br>  <br>  What was Jesus's position on the poor, the sick, the hungry, and the money changers?<br>  <br>  If you can understand Jesus, then you understand liberalism.<br>  <br>  No mega-church... just sandals, humble poverty, love and compassion for others with a bane for all trappings of physical desire.|`|cpLoD9NJaa	I quit trying to understand it a long time ago!  <br>  <br>  Funny how the first guy brings Jesus into it!  Christian Conservatives give more to charities than any liberals!  We are a very charitable people, just don't like to be forced to give our money to people that Washington deems fit to receive it.|`|pM81f5tnaa	Yeah, you do need some help with that.

AA11206283	If you are using any software to download copyright material without paying for it, you are at risk of prosecution.<br>  <br>  Period.|`|Ym7H3x49aa	Haha, most people don't even know the laws like these schmucks above me. I've actually researched what the laws are for downloading music and they are shady at best. The thing is, it isn't illegal to download music. Uploading it is what can get you in trouble and even when you do that, it is hard to get caught. The only way you could get caught is by uploading over 10,000+ songs or some outrageous amount of music. You would then have to go to court and you could probably still get away with it with just a small fine. Record companies would have to hire private investigators to monitor traffic and they bust only the biggest traffickers. The government doesn't regulate or have laws against downloading music. It is legal to copy music on CD's and on your computer because when you buy the song, you own the rights to copy and distribute. The only time it becomes illegal is when you sell the copies for profit. That's why Napster was shut down a while ago. The owner was making millions from pirated music. Programs like Limewire are P2P networks. That means there is no "server" that holds all the music. Music is essentially traded back and forth from people's computers. So you are part of that network! Every song you own/download is available to be shared with other people. You can turn that setting off of course, but it doesn't really matter. So in essence, it's very difficult to pin down illegal activity and music sharing won't die out anytime soon, unless the government makes a law against it. The only thing I would watch out for is viruses. Other than that, it's safe.<br>  <br>  Download away!|`|40liOUx0aa	It doesn't matter what LimeWire you are using. If you download something illegally then you will get a warning letter and if you continue to do the same then you will be disconnected.<br>  <br>  Added:-<br>  <br>  Tanzen said:"The government doesn't regulate or have laws against downloading music."<br>  <br>  Go and have a look at the new laws set in place by the government on these P2P servers and then take a look around at the people complaining that they have been banned from having an ISP.<br>  <br>  Things have changed thanks to the government. There is only one source which cannot be identified but you would already know that with your limitless knowledge on the subject.

Most people have already gone to school, and hated every second of it. No one would like to go back because they feel they are better than than and the government will help them anyway. Complain long enough and you will get something from it, that's how people act now.<br>  <br>  People think they're already working hard enough, but that doesn't mean they can be lazy. I think it's great that you thought about this, but then you have to take into consideration all the people who have no life savings and those who do but don't want to spend it for any reason. <br>  <br>  I know a few rich people who steal from poorer people just so they don't have to take away from themselves. They think they deserve more money. I think that the people who are truly poor and in need will be the ones who will find no other choice than going back to school. I think this is the way you will find out who is being honest about need and who is not. When you need food, you go out and buy it. If you need a job and aren't qualified for what is available or what you want, you go back to school. If you're not gonna do this, you don't need money and if you need it, you're obviously too lazy to get there. <br>  <br>  If you don't go after it, you don't need it, want is or deserve it. If you want it, get out and work hard for it. Some people are just naive and think they know better.|`|foNIO68haa	Interesting that you call for personal responsibility while boasting that you 'grew up in the projects'. Do you know why they are called 'projects'? Because they are government funded projects to give very poor people a place to live (i.e a handout).

I too have persevered through tough times without someone holding my hand along the way.<br>  <br>  The problem started back in the 80's at least with the wealth effect.  Credit cards became a fad and millions of people have them now who never deserved to have them in the first place.  These banks have issued loans, credit cards and mortgages to people who didn't have the credit scores or could prove that they were responsible enough for them.  It made people think they were invincible.  I have horrible credit and I just got approved for a $1000.00 credit card.  My credit score has not gone up and I have been denied for years.  When I got it I felt a sense of satisfaction that I must be doing better, but it's not that at all.   The banks control the entire economy and they are back to their bad habits giving credit cards and loans to people like me who don't deserve them.  <br>  <br>  It's going to crash again in just a few years even harder than right now.  So much that the next time you and I and everyone else who has fought so far will not be able to fight anymore.

By taking the risk out of business, innovation and ingenuity will decrease.  There will be no incentive to succeed.  What does this produce?  Socialism.<br>  <br>  If the gov't convinces the people that they have no responsibility for any part of their lives, it is easy for them to gain power over them.<br>  <br>  And of course, it is the easy way out so it is attractive to those who are lazy or unwilling to accept responsibility.<br>  <br>  We have contributed to some of this ourselves.  Each generation wants the next to have it easier than they did.  So now we have parents giving children their every want and desire without having to work for it.  These children become adults and when they don't have their needs met by parents any longer, they turn to gov't.<br>  <br>  What we have basically is a group of children who are over 21.<br>  <br>  Accepting assistance to get out of a rough spot is not the same as depending on gov't for your livlihood.  That is the very reason these programs were created.  But too many have decided that the gov't is their source of income and refuse to take advantage of the help available.  I gladly pay taxes so people like you can use them to better themselves.<br>  <br>  And I am sure you realize that your continued success depends on not living above your means, have a savings account for emergencies, and researching your career before wildly taking any job.  Some jobs are recession-proof and education is one of them.

N4Ct35GFaa	@phil: So wait, are you Webster? Are you the king of the English language?  Because last time I checked, the definitions of words changes constantly throughout history.  That is the most retarded bs lame excuse against gay marriage ever concocted.  Please tell me why you don't speak in Old English? Hmm? Because that language has changed into the one we speak today!  No, the fact of the matter is you are homophobic, self-righteous, and judgmental.  If you are not gay, feel free to not marry another man, but neither you nor anyone else has any right to say whether or not two men can get married.  <br>  <br>  On topic, there are tax, insurance, health care, etc related concerns that apply to married people, but there is no reason why these should not be afforded to homosexuals as well.<br>  <br>  Who's rights are we going to be taking away next?

In a country with 50% divorce rate... those arguments about the sacred state of marriage ring pretty hollow, no?|`|nbibIzC5aa	There is not really a legal argument behind why homosexuals cannot get married.  The Supreme Court has recognized that everyone should be entitled to get married, whether or not it is to a person of the same sex.  The only problem comes from politicians who try to act in the best interest of their constituents.  As long as there is not a strong support for gay marriage, politicians will not favor laws granting them equal rights. <br>  <br>  The law does evolve over time.  The Supreme Court has taken the first steps by recognizing gay marriage in some states.  These states then pass new laws interpreting the rulings of the Supreme Court.  These laws may then prohibit gay marriage in another way, trying to keep in the conditions of the court's ruling; or they may except the court's ruling and pass a law recognizing their rights.  <br>  <br>  Should a state try and prohibit gay marriage again, then another challenge in the Supreme Court is needed to rule the law unconstitutional.  The reason why the law evolves slowly is due to the time it takes the Supreme Court to hear an issue.  Sometimes it could take over ten years for an issue to reach the court.  The Supreme Court only hears about a 100 cases each year but issues that are highlighted in the news tend to be heard sooner by the court than other cases.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|Jwk7Ib2vaa	There aren't many. In fact, when asking the average person, they may not have a real reason as to why they won't accept the union. The great thing is, we're in America, we don't need to accept everyone's practices, beliefs, and opinions. <br>  I'm not saying I agree With that view, but it's the truth. Religion aside, people may just not want to see a man with a man or vice versa. Personally, I don't see a problem with letting their unions take place, but that doesn't mean because I'm accepting of them, that everyone else is as well. I truly believe no harm can come from the marriage of two people being in love. They should be allowed to visit their spouses in hospital rooms and whatever else they see fit to have as "normal a life" as possible.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA10058555	Homosexuals should be afforded the same rights & responsibilities, but it should NOT be called marriage.

People can't just go around changing definitions of words to suit them. It's kind of arrogant of them to even think they have the right to change it.|`|OItPJZjBaa	I think they should be allowed to get married and adopt.  Religion pushes people to believe that love and marriage should only be between a man and a women. I believe that you can't help who you fall in love with. Yes, I understand that in order to reproduce it has to be between a man and a women, but if society would accept homosexuals as part of the world, then maybe we wouldn't be so overpopulated. Which in turn, we wouldn't have to worry about mass food supply, or mass job supply.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	Well, what if the people of a state (by virtue of a popular vote) decide to ban such a union in their state... (the 10th amendment gives them that right) - State A<br>  <br>  Now in State B, gay marriage is legal.<br>  So, a gay couple of State B moves to State A.<br>  The full faith and credit clause of the Constitution says that each state must recognize marriages from all other states... so, now State A, even though it is banned, must give the couple from State B all of the rights and privileges that they would give any other married couple, even though technically, it is illegal... THUS, negating their right as a state to ban the marriage.<br>  <br>  So, Clinton tried to remedy this with DOMA (with the help of Bob Barr, who is a libertarian), but erasing parts of the Constitution that don't quite agree with your politics CANNOT be the answer!|`|2MfFXmNMaa	There is no legal argument.

Without doubt there are double standards at play here - and, yes, it's a total no-brainer that a White PF would not be tolerated for a second. But I guess the argument for the BPF goes back to the time of the McPherson report (hope I got the name right) into the Steven Lawrence murder, when I believe the term "institutional racism" was first coined and levelled as an accusation <br>  against the police force as a whole. If one accepts that such high levels of prejudice did exist within the force at that time, then it's not hard to see how some order of counter measure such as the BPF was needed to ensure non white officers were afforded fair treatment/equal opportunities with their white colleagues - and to encourage more non whites to enlist. However the trouble so often when "positive discrimination" is applied, and special cases are made for people who've hitherto been felt to be getting a raw deal, is that the pendulum then goes on to swing too far in the opposite direction. And somehow whenever it's white Brits being discriminated against now, this is deemed to be acceptable and justified - even our "just deserts" for having had it so good all those years, as if ANY working class peoples of whatever background were ever anything other than thoroughly f*cked over by the ruling class elite.<br>  Damn, I'm losing my thread now - so I'll shut up.<br>  Good quezzy, Fin!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Okay, scrub all of the above - <br>  MR SCEPTIC'S ALTER EGO  just hit nail on the head beautifully!|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	It hinders race relations in the force.

Just because one is told something happened doesn't mean it happened in the way it did.The same system lied to us about Iraq and Afghanistan and everything in between, why not the Holocaust? For example the German Government sent its scientists to prove the gas chambers when they couldn't the German Gov jailed them (Germer Rudolph) the Rudolph report. The commandant of Austwich was tortured to a confession of guilt, at the Nuremberg trials files and testimony was withheld from the Defence lawyers.History is always one sided and,to believe unconditionally the Holocaust industry is just intellectual laziness.

The stock market is not a measure of the economy. The stock market is an illusion. A company is not worth one dollar now and one thousand the next minute in the real market.It works fine for the brokers but it doesn't do any good for the real economy. Besides, the companies in the stock market are all big corporations. What helps the economy is exchange of goods and services and with diversity. If the big corporations keep growing and end up being the only source of employment, the salaries suffer due to lack of diversity. A restricted market does that, with a small number of buyers, the sellers have to accept the low price or get kicked out of the market (sounds familiar, doesn't it). With an open market, there's diversity. The employers have to compete for labor the same way the employees have to compete for job positions. Then the salaries get defined by offer and demand. <br>  <br>  The real problem of the TARP is that it's going to suck wealth OUT of the market to spit it back again... with a huge chunk lost in the process. The government is not 100% efficient, let's face it, the government is hardly 20% efficient. And, even worse, it's discriminatory because the government decides who gets rewarded. In the real market there's no discrimination. The rule is simple, you produce, you get rewarded. <br>  <br>  By the way, I love your plan and I've been promoting that for ages. It's the way to get out of this socialist system and move to a freedom voluntary system. I'm willing to offer ALL the government bureaucracy a 10 years off plan. 10 years of pay if they do absolutely nothing. Most of the will retire during that period and the rest have to find another source of income. 10 years! you can't say that it isn't enough. And it's a LOT cheaper than letting they "work"...|`|46eoAIGZaa	I was reading an article the other day about how when the dow went up through the other means to help the economy it was a temporary solution and the market eventually dropped more than it went up (hence the problem now).  The ending of the article was does the market really reflect how the government is helping the economy?  I don't know to be honest, but I find it interesting all around.  I also don't think we've given it enough time to see the effect.  I'm not a dem or a rep, but I do believe you need to give time to see things take effect.

Likewise, this cartoon says "They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill"  There is no indication that the Chimpanzee is in anyway Obama, as cartoonist will often name the characters so the readers will understand whom is whom in the cartoon.  The WRITERS of this stimulus bill was not Barack Obama, it was Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and David Obey from the US House of Representatives and unless you are a complete moron or Reverend Al, you would know that none of the writers of the bill are black.  Obama refused to draft a bill and submit it to the House to vote on, so the HOUSE wrote the Wasteful Spending and Pork Bill, all the Obama-messiah did was to sign it.  So the cartoonist did not label the chimp as Obama, the writers of the bill was not Obama, the ONLY logical deduction is that the chimp does not refer in any way to Obama, but the idiot leaders in the House.<br>  <br>  If the cartoon had Obama written across the monkey as cartoonist usually do when signifying a single person in the cartoon, then I could see how the cartoon could be seen by some reasonable people to be offensive, HOWEVER, since there was no such indication, and Obama had nothing to do with writing the spending bill, then no reasonable person can call this cartoon racist, especially as the leader of the pack is a publicity hound who has a track record of repeatedly playing the race card whenever he hasn't been heard from in the last hour.<br>  <br>  whale|`|a7Lmyxmkaa	uuuummmm...for one who cares which party he was in, or who wrote it...the fact of the matter is this...racist or not it ties in to easily with our current situation.

If you look at the stimulus, they are not getting the same benefits as people who are in homes they could afford, but not the home has lost 40% of its value or they got convinced that their ARM would not double after 5 years or whatever.<br>  <br>  So, we can let the freefall continue, and new housing developments sit half done and have property values fall even more so that the responsible people will suffer also.  Or we can try and stop a lot of the foreclosures and keep people in their houses and keep home values from dropping even more.  Seems like a no-brainer to me.  Either way you pay somehow.

If you want some tactical/special ops type training then I would say Army or Marines. The reason why is because if  you don't make it, you are still trained in combat tactics and stuff. In the navy if you don't make SEAL, then your basically stuck on a ship with no weapons training. If you want an easier ride to put in a few years and get college pay'd for then go into the Air Force or Navy. You will not be in that much/if any danger.

Obviously, libertarians should not have voted for the counterfeit "Libertarian" Party candidate Bob Barr (although he was an acceptable candidate for conservatives to vote for), as he was not a libertarian, so if libertarians voted last year, I hold that the only proper way to vote was to vote for a 3rd party candidate other than Barr (among the major 3rd party candidates, I would argue that Constitution Party candidate Chuck Baldwin should have been preferred as he was clearly more libertarian than far-left candidates Nader and McKinney).<br>  <br>  I did not vote for Obama or for McCain.

Data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, the International Comparison Program (ICP) (a cooperative venture coordinated by the World Bank) and the U.S. Census Bureau allow a nonpartisan, factual assessment, says Marsden. <br>  <br>  Economic growth:<br>  <br>  U.S. output has expanded faster than in most advanced economies since 2000. <br>  The IMF reports that real U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent over the period 2001-2008 (including its forecast for the current year). <br>  President Bush will leave his successor an economy 19 percent larger than the one he inherited from President Clinton. <br>  This U.S. expansion compares with 14 percent by France, 13 percent by Japan and just 8 percent by Italy and Germany over the same period.<br>  The latest ICP findings, published by the World Bank in its World Development Indicators 2008, also show that GDP per capita in the United States reached $41,813 (in purchasing power parity dollars) in 2005; this was a third higher than the United Kingdom's, 37 percent above Germany's and 38 percent more than Japan's.<br>  Household consumption:<br>  <br>  The ICP study found that the average per-capita consumption of the U.S. population (citizens and illegal immigrants combined) was second only to Luxembourg's, out of 146 countries covered in 2005. <br>  The U.S. average was $32,045; this was well above the levels in the UK ($25,155), Canada ($23,526), France ($23,027) and Germany ($21,742). China stood at $1,751.<br>  Source: Keith Marsden, "Bush Has a Good Economic Record," Wall Street Journal, September 3, 2008.|`|7y6yfrQlaa	my guess they saw the damages that bush did to the country; and the fact that mcbush wanted to continue on that same destructive path|`|TAYErNRkaa	There was a small percentage that actually researched Obamas campaign promises and his history of voting on issues and where he stood on certain issues, but an even larger percentage got caught up in the making history, the platform of change( which we haven't seen too much of yet )and the momentum of excitement as the spin dr.s from the left coast began whispering sweet nothings into the ears of the enraptured elect. It was actually remarkable to watch as the Obama supporters, who may have been looking for peace, tolerance and unity, finally succumb to the true essence of their agenda, becoming themselves intolerant, judgmental,hateful, disrespectful, small minded and absolutely closed to any opposing ideals.

In an effort to curtail this disease from spreading, the UN will challenge any country, especially rogue nations, such as Iran, Syria, North Korea, from actually developing these weapons.<br>  <br>  The UN does not attempt to disarm or inspect countries with these devices, it has no power of persuasion to exert.  It can still negotiate, threaten, and coerce those who they suspect of attempted development.|`|K6pqXAC2aa	Iran having nukes= nuclear arms race in the Middle East=not good.

You also need to pass a fitness test and a mental health test. Finally during the question period they rule out certain types of people and if you are one of them they will not accept you. For example, criminal record, or if you lied about your answers or they simply don't think you will be an asset and more of a disturbance. The army is very serious, they need to know they can trust you with classified information and weapons. For more info just look up for country's armed forces website.

Wright instead of digging a bit deeper to learn more about the man and his viewpoints.  If racism didn't exist, the focus on Rev. Wright wouldn't have been a caricature but would have pointed out that the infamous "GD America, Chickens have come home to roost" sound bites were from sermons where he was repeating the words of a (white) UN Ambassador concerning US foreign policy.  The CIA calls it "blow back".  <br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/04252008/profile.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/042520...</a><br>  <br>  I saw him on Bill Moyer's Journal (PBS) one Friday evening and he struck me as a very learned and thoughtful man.  Then I saw him on C-SPAN's coverage of his appearance at the National Press Club breakfast the following Monday morning, and he came across as more buoyant and yes, strident too.  If there wasn't racism we all could have laughed because Rev. Wright was right... many of us white folks do not know how to clap on the downbeat.    <br>  <a href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:QX9RT65h1cQJ:www.press.org/members/transcript/20080428_wright.pdf+national+press+club+breakfast+transcript+%22Jeremiah+Wright%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us&ie=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:QX9R...</a><br>  <br>  My overall impression... on Moyer's program, he 'gave as good as he got'; at the press club breakfast, he played to an audience that hadn't given a fair break and still wouldn't so he "fell on his sword" for Obama.

If you declare 12% of gross sales you do not have to support it. If you declare less, then you do.<br>  <br>  Keep an accurate record of what you get - both in credit card add-ins and cash tips - on a day-by-day basis. You are never required to pay taxes on money you do not earn. <br>  <br>  In addition, what your boss pays you, plus your ACTUAL tips, must add up to minimum wage. He cannot pay you less than that by recording that you made more than you really did in tips.<br>  <br>  Richard|`|SskndQTRaa	If you are putting down more then what you made then you will be getting taxed for it. Which is illegal for the IRS to even do. If you didn't make it, don't write it down. You probably get paid below minimum wage, and that's just your boss's way of covering himself to the state that your tips make up for enough for you to get paid at least minimum wage. Because if your tips are not making up for it, by law, he would have to raise your hourly pay rate.

Best thing to do, and get it out in the open, is confront your Mom as to WHY she hacked in! If she WAS worried about something, maybe you can reassure her, and ask her to trust you!

One of the best duty stations i've ever been too! People are so friendly, money's a bit weird at first- the conversion rate out in town gets kinda confusing.

Housing is smaller then what you're used too but do-able. Moving isin  as bad as you'd think it would be. It was fairly easy. As for your fiance getting orders to Japan- there are 2 kinds of orders to Japan. Accompanied, where you CAN bring your family along, and Unaccompanied, where your family will NOT be able to go with you. My orders were unaccompanied, so i was flying solo. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!

For example, a house that was worth $600,000 five months ago might be worth $400,000 now. That's $200,000 worth of goods disappearing.<br>  <br>  Of course, the house should never have been worth $600,000 in the first place.

BImIMnbzaa	Back during the Vietnam era, there was a campus uprising at Kent University in Ohio.  The national Guard was sent in to quiet the demonstrators.  They were issued ammunition, and through the melee, the Guard started shooting demonstrators.  When the smoke cleared, six college students lay mortally wounded or already dead.<br>  <br>  This was a political uprising over the Vietnam war, and the lives of our young people were exposed to the undiscipline and minimum training of week end warriors.  The country has never lived down that catastrophic event.

We're in a deflation, which means the government is printing more money by the billions.<br>  <br>  In deflationary periods, printing more money has no effect on the value of the dollar for many years.<br>  <br>  We gotta make our economy strong before that happens, or else the value of our dollar will drop significantly, and we'll probably be screwed if things aren't OK by then. I mean literally, SCREWED.|`|8a8a4f9bdc242ac1527541eba8696dfeaa	Yep its true.  But what he didn't talk about was the fact that the Fed has been building a pyramid scheme with our money since at least 1971 when we finally went off the gold standard.  We've been on a fractional reserve system since then and its(The Fed) been building up to destroy us since 1913.  Here's a video about the Federal reserve and the Fractional Banking system.  Then you will see the whole picture here that we are facing.  No stimulus in the world will save us from this collapse.  They will do what ever they can to keep this game going, I can imagine even martial law being called on us.  Confiscation of our firearms. Food rationing.  Fighting in the streets.

GXxC8CIfaa	Socialism is a false utopia.  It's an illusion...it does not work.  <br>  <br>  Read carefully so you can get the big picture...the problem is that people always modify their behavior.  <br>  <br>  This is what socialism and communism can not seem to figure out.  When people realize no matter how hard you work everyone receives an equal wage, then they adjust their behavior.  Why work 20 hrs. of overtime if the government is just going to tax it all away?  (why be more productive?)  If I can cut back on my work so I bring in less income and by doing so qualify for the government to "assist" me then why not coast on the government's back?  <br>  <br>  That is why the social programs in America have not decreased poverty one single iota since the 1940's.  <br>  <br>  People will modify their behaviors in order to adjust to socalism.  What Socialism and communism would like is for people to continue to work as hard and as much and they possibly can, but WHY...there is no incentive for  your extra effort!!!  Make it worth my time financially and I will help the company I work for grow and profit as much as it possibly can!  Take that incentive away from me and I'll do the minimum...just like everybody else....<br>  <br>  That is what makes socialism and communism so incredibly stupid....who wants to be a part of that society???  <br>  Answer:  The government leaders of that society!!|`|908b0790cd51aa2d22433510f21b1e39aa	It depends, if everyone has the right attitude, it would be a really nice thing to help the less fortunate.

Using that language that is not what you learn at the police academy(in fact you learn the opposite). On top of his swearing he punches the man and slams his head off the window.

ec6d6526154860f9cab361f34526d848aa	He was beaten?  I think your lack of understanding is very very clear.<br>  <br>  The officer obviously responds to a person who decides that he is going to ride the bus for free - while not the biggest crime in the world, I pay to ride a bus so i am clueless as to why this person thinks he doesn't.<br>  <br>  Lets break this down - he is told to leave the bus multiple times and refuses - he does not need to say verbally that he refuses, his lack of action is enough.<br>  <br>  Mister citizen when the officer decides to escort him - yes he grabs him to escort him - something done by most police officers - no actually all of us have, when he does not comply, he put up resistance, did you see the suspects - no it's now an offender -hands??  <br>  <br>  The offender is now clearly going to be arrested and is now a resistor.  Crucify the officer for actibg w/o back up - but in Chicago, this is not a two car call and most people do not fight with the police,<br>  <br>  Now, banging someones head off the wall -not hard by the way - is what can be construed as a head stun - something taught at the academy with the heel of your palm.  When you have a person grabbing you - and the suspect was grabbing the officer - it is now the beginning of a street fight - one that easily can become life or death for the officer - many deaths of police start just this way.<br>  <br>  I think it's a classic case of how some people think that the world is fairy tales and picksy dust - welcome to the real world here pal - a world where this stuff can go ugly quickly!|`|kiOD8s8Kaa	I bet nobody who watched that altercation, either in person or on the video, will ever try to ride the bus without paying the fare again.

Still, I've known good cops.|`|AA11494150	I'm not impressed with the officer's choice of language, but this far from the brutality claimed by the poster.<br>  <br>  I counted 11 times he told the drunk to get off before he ever touched him. <br>  <br>  The drunk could have very easily avoided this whole situation by simply getting off the bus.
dseGQ1Jlaa	that guy tells it how it is, if immigrants hate their home country so much, why do they move somewhere else and live the exact same way?  Hispanics are some of the worst too, they leave Mexico b/c of no work and filthy living conditions only to come to America and barely work, squeeze as many people into a house as possible, never bathe, and sometimes dont even have running water.  Just b/c your country is a **** hole, dont come over to mine and run it down with your filthy ways. Arabs are bad about it too, the women leave their country b/c they are oppressed by men and have to cover their faces, but then when they get over to America they marry an Arab man and continue to cover their faces, makes no sense to me.  Like the saying goes, "When in Rome, do as the Romans do"|`|bsAetASZaa	You can read about it here.<br>   <a href="http://www.hoax-slayer.com/howard-muslim-speech.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoax-slayer.com/howard-muslim...</a>|`|MFsuN8Doaa	Good for him - I wish Gordon Brown would say the same thing here to be honest.|`|fKFvzlzQaa	Yes, I did hear that.<br>  <br>  As I understood Mr. Rudd, he was responding to Muslims who wanted Australia to change it's laws to accommodate some Muslim Practices under Sharia Law.<br>  <br>  Mr. Rudd told them that they needed to move to a Muslim Nation if they wanted to live under Sharia Law.<br>  <br>  I agree with Mr. Rudd.|`|207dFmdHaa	no I missed that....was this recent...I have a feeling you are getting at something else.....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  How are your girls FONZ?

When people find out how lame this administration is his rating will be like Nancy Pelosi 9% approval.

Five years would be a gift, and three would be the luck of the Irish.  I wish him well.|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	If he felt danger to himself then is okay to have done nothing. I think the issue lies as to why he did not report the robbery as soon as he was safe. Hence, he becomes a criminal accomplice. <br>  <br>  He better get a good attorney because he is just as responsible for the crimes. <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|ASXeYOjAaa	The best possible outcome would be if he decides to hang-out with someone other than career felons.<br>  He is also guilty of criminal conspiracy else why was no one arrested due to him immediately reporting what happened? Clearly he was quite complicit and knowingly so.|`|oVhKGw3Maa	How long after he got out of the car did Kyle call the police. He was witness to a horrific crime, you try being held up with a knife at your throat. If he did not report the crime, then he was a party to it. He was there when the man was robbed and did nothing to stop it. Its all very well being sorry after the event, but he should have gone straight to the police and tell them what happened and that he was not a party to the crime Had he had done so, he would not be facing jail time. I have no sympathy for him, he could and should have reported the crime the moment he was out of that car. Dont give me all the old story about Mark being dangerous and they were afraid of him. Thats all the more reason to have reported him before he does someone a real damage.Remember the old saying, you lay down with dogs you get up with his flea,s....<br>  <br>  <br>  I have just read in the newspapers that two more young guys were stabbed to death on friday. I hope your friend gets at least 5years. Remember this, he did nothing to stop the robbery and the cab driver could have been stabbed and killed.

The bad ones have a bit of problem with the first amendment.

The only reason the Republicans are crying their eyes out is because they're not in power. When they were in power, they did exactly the same sort of fiscally irresponsible stuff.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately neither party is willing to address (or even discuss) the real underlying problems inherent to our monetary system. The real fix would be to allow the market to set prices and interest rates again, and correct all the price distortions and malinvestment. <br>  <br>  All these petty partisan games only serve to hide the fact that both the Republicans and Democrats advocate only marginally different portions of the exact same economic agenda.|`|1NO10YfPaa	The only waste in the stimulus program is all those tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that Republicans stuffed into it.|`|KF48OjyDaa	He'll be fine...look at the guy he followed...spent trillions and accomplished absolutely nothing...not exactly a hard act to follow.|`|lXE75yQjaa	Yes, I agree completely Walt.<br>  It's never good to waste your package ;)

jthpq6Egaa	Will he be able to live off base?  Absolutely but there's a catch.  He still needs to maintain a barracks room.<br>  <br>  Here's the deal, because he is a single, junior enlisted Soldier he will need to live in the barracks.  If he decides to rent an apartment off post, it will come out of his pocket.  The Army will not pay him any housing allowances because he's technically living in the barracks.<br>  <br>  Now, if the barracks are over 90% filled, the post commander allows his subordinate commands to move junior Soldiers out of the barracks.  Typically, though, these commands will start moving the highest ranking first (Sergeants and Promotable Specialists) and then work themselves down the list until the occupancy rate drops below 90%.  Then and only then (that's if your Soldier boy happens to be one of the lucky ones allowed to move off post) will the Army pay single, junior Soldiers a housing allowance.<br>  <br>  Now, if you're married - completely different story.  Once married, you can live on post housing or off post.  Your choice...|`|LEBV1FPuaa	Technically yes but until you get married he will pay for it but in reality mp's have tough units who will stop him.|`|eJEvtQYYaa	The base housing status will determine that. Moving from the lowest rank on up, they will house single soldiers in the barracks until they are full. After that they will grant BAH for single soldiers. On Ft. Carson I saw them forcing specialists (E-4) off base due to lack of housing.<br>  <br>  You and your fiance can live off base at your choosing, but they likely will not grant him BAH.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	Not likely unless he is married.  Usually special permission can be granted but unless he is married he will not get BAH.

In Berlin, 200,000 Germans marched to show their solidarity with America. The French newspaper of record, Le Monde, ran a front-page headline reading "Nous sommes tous Américains", or "We are all Americans". A national day of mourning was held in Ireland on Friday, September 14, the only country other than the U.S.A. to do so. In London, the U.S. national anthem was played at the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace. (To mark the Queen's Golden Jubilee, New York City lit the Empire State Building in purple and gold, to say "thank you" for this action.) In the immediate aftermath, support for the United States' right to defend itself was expressed across the world, and by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1368.<br>  <br>  Reaction to the attacks in the Muslim world was mixed. The great majority of Muslim political and religious leaders condemned the attacks — virtually the only significant exception was Saddam Hussein, then president of Iraq. Also, shortly after the attack, the media picked up on a number of celebrations of the attacks in the Middle East with images of these celebrations being broadcast on television and published in print. Less publicized were public displays of sympathy, including candlelight vigils in countries like Iran."<br>  <br>  from: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_the_September_11_attacks#International_reaction" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_o...</a>|`|Jx1GDVF7aa	you seem to have overlooked the bit of history where england was into religious oppression, (that motivated a bunch of folks to come over here).<br>  <br>  <br>  putting that aside, i do recall reading that certain canadian sports teams were playing certain american sports teams & played out national anthem ,....|`|mF0L5jMNaa	I was out of the country on 9/11.

Not everything harsh or negative is child abuse.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	It's all based upon societal, religious, cultural views of the aspect.  Some people find spanking to be bad but in most religions they would disagree. I believe that if it causes no physical or mental harm to the child it is okay.  I also believe that if it has been known to work in the past, then it may be okay.  Every one is different though.  I personally believe that spoiling a child is not good & not punishing them is not good either.  Some form of disapproval must be shown to teach a lesson.  Whether it be spanking, taking things away for awhile like games/ overnight sleepovers/privileges, etc.  tough love has to be shown.  Yelling does not solve anything & arguing with a child is so immature for an adult to do.  They have the upperhand and need to use it to their advantage since they are the more mature person.  Maybe not in the since of slapping lol but using their authority in the way that they should & take control, not let the child take control of them.|`|oG9FZ5hWaa	i heard a rumor of someone doing this to their child and as the child was crying it inhaled some hot sauce or spices and actually died! i don't know how true this is but why risk it?|`|qiLJlMWUaa	it is a punishment, its a sin, it hurts its a baby and you are an idiot|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Yes it would.

This was brought up in a case where the child died but he was mentally handicapped and got into the salt in the pantry and died from all the sodium intake. I think children should be spanked on their bottoms where all the padding and fat are. It will not hurt them.

Ask what they'd do to the armed robbers running amok here, ask what they'd do to the thieves and dope peddlers. We've become so "humane" now (and politically correct) we can no longer stomach the kind of actions we desperately need to save this country. We're in deep trouble here and all our young people can come up with is how evil George Bush is, or how terrible the Iraq war is, or how bad racism and prejudice is here, or how awful the conservatives are, or on and on ad infinitum.

There are postcards that show African Americans as almost indistinguishable from monkeys and apes. There are prints that show Blacks and monkeys romantically involved. There are dozens of other objects in the museum that link Africans and Americans of African ancestry to monkeys and apes. Material objects, of course, both shape and reflect beliefs. In the 1940s, for example many three-dimensional objects were produced in the United States that tried to link (in a negative way) Blacks to monkeys. In that same decade, Black soldiers faced stereotypes that demeaned their intelligence, loyalty, and bravery, and, remarkably enough, claimed that they had tails. The material objects reinforced the tales.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	What's the party of evolutionist?  Sounds like another silly term from the GOP.  People don't have to like the cartoon.

Chimpanzees and humans are not monkeys.  Chimpanzees are not in a direct evolutionary line with humans.  <br>  <br>  As for your point (as I understand it), an African American being compared to a chimpanzee was a tasteless gesture from a historical vantage point.

This is a time of rebuilding for the Republicans. In order to capture future success they must reconnect with their base and undecideds. The only way they can do this is through sound judgment.

2xUNIc73aa	Don't blow this up into something major.  It is easily resolved.<br>  <br>   Of course that nice boy may come to visit with your son.  Just tell him to leave his dogs at home because they frighten people.  Also, you might want to have a friendly chat with the parents--explain that you really like their son, but the dogs are causing a problem.<br>  <br>  You are missing the landlord's point,  He's not really concerned about the neighbor boy, he's worried about the dog situation.  The landlord might be liable for big damages if those dogs happen to injure anyone on his property.|`|AA10628838	Instead of making a big issue about the dogs, just talk to the boy's parents and explain that the dogs need to stay home so he can come and play. Legally the landlord cannot prevent you from having company, but if the landlords think the dogs are dangerous, then just have the little boy to leave them at home.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Your landlord has delusions of grandeur.<br>  <br>  He can't decide which visitors you have as long as they haven't done any damage to his property.<br>  <br>  Can't possibly be legal.|`|iFAlZfVMaa	Don't have the dogs over.  <br>  <br>  The landlord MAY have the right to exclude the dogs... anything more is petty and infantile.

Without some sort of restraining order, your landlord can't prohibit people from visiting you.|`|IARYnu6zaa	He can't do anything about who you have over as long as they aint damaging his property.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	Are we talking about a house or an apartment?   With an apartment I wouldn't think they could tell you what kind of dogs can be outside of it especially if you don't own them since you're not renting the outside of the building.  If it's a house then you're renting the land too and I guess they can probably tell you what animals you can have on their property.  Why don't you ask them to keep the dogs at their house?|`|Ay7Fkvd4aa	Your question is confusing. Do the dogs come over with the boy or are the dogs already at your house?  If the boy is bringing dogs over with him then your landlord can prohibit pets from being inside the home.|`|cd3d6652026769d6c622057ae1142194aa	Sadly enough, your landlord owns the land and when they say that you can't have somebody on the property, that means you have to actually listen.<br>  <br>  It seems like the biggest problem they have is with the dogs however, and not the kid himself.  Why don't you talk to your landlord (the husband) about it and see if you can't compromise?  Your son can still keep playing with the neighbor who comes over, as long as the friend realizes and knows that he can't bring his dogs along with him when he comes.  This should eliminate the problem.<br>  <br>  If the landlord finds this acceptable, take your son and his friend off to the side and explain the situation to them.  Kids are more smart and understanding then adults like to give them credit for, I'm sure they'll understand.  If the friend insists he must have his dogs along, you'll have to explain that your son will have to just play over at his friends house instead.

Also, you might check with a inexpensive divorcee attorney, since they know the ins and outs of name changes.|`|OiAl6w48aa	A civil attorney.  This is such a basic legal proceudre that it doesn't require its own special subset within the law (ie, family law attorneys, probate attorneys, etc.).  Even a person who was just admitted to the bar the day before could competently perform a name change.|`|qiLJlMWUaa	they are are called attorneys they just do different things or specialized in different things.|`|uSeApMt9aa	usually you would seek a marriage and divorce lawyer for this type on thing.

Why?  Could it be that people think our country needs saving?  If so, why?<br>  Bush was our iceberg.  Obama hopefully will be able to be the Carpathian. Not all of the passengers will be rescued, and it won't get there on time, but some were saved.<br>  Its not great, but its the best we have right now, and if he fails, we all continue our slide.|`|f4fe8bcc0295a2e74c87174ff633496aaa	As an African/American he must succeed and let us remember the majority voted him to the highest office in the land.

Banking, Chris Dodd style. First, put a rumor in the market causing a run on the stock of the two biggest banks. Once the market value is down to nothing, Nationalize the banks and remove any private ownership. This is the equivalent to 0bamas hero FDR confiscating Americans gold, then immediately increasing it's value by 75%.  I'm not sure what school politicians go to to learn economics, but we need to shut it down as a fraud perpetrated on the population.<br>  <br>  I feel for your losses. I've been making about 5% per month in my daughters account and 10% in mine. I'm taking more risk than I'm allowing in her account which is the reason for the difference. If you want to make money in this market, learn to trade options properly. Key word is "properly". Buy and hold will not work in today's markets.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	I have $7,200 into an account worth $4,100.<br>  It was bad before Obama took over.<br>  It is not the Presidents fault.<br>  It is the suits on Wall Street stealing all our money.<br>  <br>  I too am pissed.<br>  I choose to take it out on every tie wearing poophead I see.|`|cOJyoXEhaa	I like the way everyone blames bush for this.

I haven't lost a dime, and I look to triple by portfolio when the market corrects in 2010.<br>  <br>  Thanks for asking.  I call it "going by the facts and reading non-political statements" to figure out what is really going on.  I'm not alone since there is another $9 trillion also sitting on the side line.  You are being played.  Think about it.  The news media is run by multi-millionares and what they say panics people, which is when they make their riches.<br>  <br>  Make sure you can invest as much as you can right now, and you can join us on the upswing rather that going back to "breaking even."  The money isn't gone until someone goes bankrupt or you cash out.  Keep that in mind.  Or you can sit around and b*tch and moan.  No skin off my nose.  <br>  <br>  Today is a great day to toss another $10K into the market.  I'll be right back.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Awww, should I have put some anti-Obama or anti-Bush rant in there somewhere to get a thumbs up?  :D  Grow up.  Envy is ugly.<br>  <br>  And if your daughter is planning on going to college in the next 3 years and you lost that much, fire your financial planner.  A time horizon-appropriate 529 should have lost little value or gained.  If more than 6-10 years, relax because it will get better if the consumers stop being to nancy-pancy political about the economy.  Otherwise, there is nothing that will help out of another Great Depression except WWIII.|`|N1gd7juqaa	Lost it all last October and back in 2000 and 1997 ! but thats no problem cause i'm still young and can make $$$ no problem !|`|7WpXJtqCaa	Fed's predicted yesterday unemployment will double by the end of the year,....<br>  Sounds like we are heading for the great dooms day, called Depression!<br>  Plus the complete fall of the stock market!<br>  <br>  The wealthy are taking their money out of the country!<br>  Wouldn't you?|`|NszF4opeaa	ME too!!

Keep some (about half) of your funds as Conservative in order to stem off losses in the event the economy continues to fall.<br>  <br>  Diversify!

Secondly, read.  Read all kinds of news sources so that you know what is going on world wide, not just in America.  And study politics and stay away from pundits.  They only know group think.

DgfEkFGLaa	What are you suggesting exactly? That African-Americans should be shot and not the rampant chimp that had attacked a human being?<br>  So you are saying:<br>   "maybe the REAL cops who shot the REAL Chimp thought the same thing!"? <br>  Would there be any reason for them to think that Obama was in Connecticut and had violently attacked a human? I am not sure who would be more offended by your question, Obama or the Police Officers. I just hope Homeland Security keeps an eye on people like you.
BHBQPFzlaa	Bailing out the banks was important, because inaction would have meant that hundreds of thousands of Americans would have lost a lot of their money. When I say "lost", I don't mean depreciating assets like stocks or money in an account, I mean walking up to a bank and they have no money to give you. The FDIC would have not have even come close in being able to cover this kind of loss. Retired people would be broke and have to work again, companies who had taken out payroll loans would have to declare bankruptcy, and in the end mortgages would have to be bought up by the government anyway. Wouldn't you rather the government own your bank instead of your house?<br>  <br>  We were about 30 days from being just like Soviet Russia, complete with bread lines and rationing of utilities.|`|ilzMZNTtaa	Very Bad.

And thanks to living in an upside-down reality, smart people across the land are stopping making their mortgage payments so they can get on the bad list so they can have their principle and interest rate lowered.<br>  <br>  In a few years when the housing market picks up again, those who diligently paid on a loan way bigger than the house is now worth will be at a disadvantage compared to those who got renegotiated because the bums will have a lot more equity, so can afford to sell at a slightly lower price and still make way more money than you.<br>  <br>  It's a mad mad mad mad world.|`|tUvgIc7Yaa	hell no|`|ZiRhHLvPaa	doubt it...|`|f624b66aaed0290aaf76eedf3378ad4caa	Sure.

I don't have the full facts and figures and I haven't checked tonight, but I think many in the UK would be very surprised at how well armed our police actually are. Yes, I personally find this a little intimidating, but I have no doubt that most armed response officers are genuinely respectful of there fire power and will use it responsibly and reasonably if and when it's needed. It's the odd 'accident' or the odd act of recklessness that does worry me a little that we read about from time to time. But the crims are well armed, and the police need to be ready likewise.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	That's the idea, depends on how you look at it.<br>  If you haven't done anything wrong then an armed cop is a guy who defends you.

They are beginning to look a bit like a military force and as a consequence it is difficult ot trust them in the way I have been accustomed. I knew the reasons I just wish they would be a little more low key about it. The present set up rather encourages a macho attitude towards the public which will further alienate them|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	Well I hope they are intimidating, at least to those who are criminals.  To the law abiding there is no reason to be intimidated by law enforcement officers that are armed.|`|M7GnRpd0aa	I can appreciate why they have to be armed with the gun crime in London, but the armed Police I have seen at airports strut around and seem very intimidating to members of the public.

OiAl6w48aa	Ask your attorney.  Some jurisdictions recognize a privilege for certain kinds of financial information.  Although I'm guessing that your lawsuit involves a wage claim for future income?  In which case, the other attorney will most likely be entitled to those returns for the purpose of establishing your wage earning history.  <br>  <br>  As far as your SS records, that's a different beast.  Every state has a varying degree of protection on these records, so you may or may not have to produce them.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that the best person to ask is your attorney.  He/she will be familiar with the law in this area and will know what you do and do not have to produce.  Leave it up to them to worry about.<br>  <br>  Edit: Michelob86 may not have given a popular answer based on the other responses I'm seeing here, but its accurate.  Discovery is not optional in civil lawsuits.  You don't get to personally decide which requests you want to ignore and which you will comply with.  You run the risk of being subjected to court sanctions if you fail to properly comply with discovery requests.  If YOUR attorney tells you that you need to turn over those documents, you need to do that.<br>  <br>  Edit 2: It doesn't matter if you currently have the information or not.  If you can get it, you have to provide it.  Otherwise every person in every lawsuit would throw out all the incriminating documents and then just claim "I don't have it, so I can't give it to you."<br>  <br>  If its a valid request, you have to comply.  Even if that means you have to go out and request those documents from somewhere else.|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	You should only do what YOUR attorney recommends. <br>  <br>  Why would you do what the "other" attorney wants?

If you are claiming that you have lost such-and-such amount of income due to this sexual harassment, then your past earnings, as evidenced by your tax returns, are certainly relevant to determining exactly how much income you indeed lost.<br>  <br>  If you are not pleading lost income, but only emotional distress, loss of dignity, or punitive damages, then your tax returns are arguably irrelevant.|`|XlGjBPBTaa	It has been my experience that if I have nothing to hide, and I have nothing to lose then I would open my records to the other side.<br>  If, on the other hand they are trying to get me locked, up, or to get money from me, I would make them work their asses off to get my records.

The case deals with the person bothering you while at work/home, it shouldn't have anything to do with your working habits and what you make income wise.<br>  <br>  Instead of giving away needless information to your attorneys, who don't need them, tell them they need to focus on the case.  The case is that you're getting harassed at work, and not how much you're making.  If they insist, I suggest looking elsewhere.  Your income should have nothing to do with what the other guy is doing.|`|VG4r3miJaa	I don't really see the harm, but ask your attorney.  There should be a formal method to obtain needed info.  If he can demonstrate that it is pertinent to his case, he will be able to obtain it regardless|`|COhYuTj3aa	Discovery.  You have to.  But I don't see how your tax returns are relevant to a sexual harassment case.  Maybe you should ask your attorney about relevancy here.  Good luck.|`|2rcSILkWaa	You have to.

BQG15WsHaa	You'll walk in the door and tell him what you're looking for and he'll sugar coat everything for you. Make sure you research your stuff online so you know what to expect. He'll give you a bunch of forms to fill out(not anything that will bind you to them, just your basic info/medical history/criminal history) Then he'll bug you to come in within the next few days so he can get a stack of paperwork done (the stack is about 2 inches tall) You will be sick of your social security number and your initials by the time you're done. He will ask you what 3 jobs your interested in and he'll get you on the next shipload to MEPS.

YupMCYHlaa	Fully 1/3 of people in our federal prisons are 'casual' drug users, i.e. not addicts, not people who have committed crimes to feed their habit, just people who used drugs.<br>  <br>  Strangely, the people who want casual drug users to go to jail forever are the same ones who insist government is too expensive and demand huge tax cuts.<br>  <br>  I agree that it should be illegal to sell pot in schoolyards, or to drive under the influence.  But if we just legalized pot and sold it in liquor stores, subject to the same restrictions and penalties as alcohol, we could save tens of billions a year in this country, maybe hundreds of billions.  Not only would we free up lots of room in prisons, but lots of people would be employed in growing, processing and packaging pot.  It could come under health and safety standards so it would be safer.  Plus we could tax it 1000% and people wouldn't mind because it would still be cheaper than it is now!<br>  <br>  Did you know the big tobacco companies have already registered brand names for pot?|`|i5F2jwvhaa	they are not freeing murderers or rapists to make room for potheads so your question is pointless|`|AaXl3vcCaa	i think non- violent or sexual offenders should not get jail time, drug offenses and stuff like that they need rehab more than sitting in a room with other users for a few months talking about how they can get more drugs together when they get out|`|0Of1i0Ruaa	I would really hesitate before grouping smoking marijuana with raping or killing someone.

It is 17,000 extra on top of what was already planned to go. The Marines alone are sending battallions. BATTALLIONS!! Thats a LOT of our guys (and some girls). We knew that my husbands unit was standing up to go to Afghanistan while he was still in Iraq last year!! And way before Obama ever got elected. But to answer your question, even the guys going don't know exactly why. They are trying to wipe out the Taliban and that is all they know. This many troops have not stood up like this since the surge into Iraq in the early 90s. Ponder on that for a while.|`|G6yyceAxaa	OK, what news do you read or watch if any.<br>  <br>  Fact: Osama Bin Laden has been hiding in Afghanistan for years<br>  <br>  Fact: Taliban training camps operate there also.<br>  <br>  Their is no civil war,  during the Soviet Invasion, The US funded a little known group called Taliban, to fight against the Soviets.  once the Soviets left, this group took over the country. they instilled strict Islamic law.  the country became a haven for radical Islamic because of the strict Islamic laws.<br>  <br>  Osama Bin Laden moved their, and because he was rich (his family are rich Saudis) he built schools and basically won the hearts of the people. from there he recruited for his new organization called Al-Quida<br>  <br>  And the rest is history.  If you have an issue with Obama, please make sure you know what your talking about.<br>  <br>  Unless you still believe that there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and want to continue to look for them.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	Ummm... First off, the "surge" happened in Iraq, and it DID work...<br>  Second, despite what Democrats and the media have taught you, the war really has nothing to do with who DID attack us, but who COULD or WILL attack us...|`|AA11450062	Becasue Republicans failed with their surge that failed the American people so this time Democrats will listen to the troops on the ground.|`|C5AhlEY5aa	Obama is determined to get Osama. Sure would help his popularity.|`|yiPZ1UZAaa	I stand by any decision that Obama makes, if he says we should send troops to Afghanistan then we should!|`|vSRhp7zxaa	So tell us:  Is Osama Bin Laden likely to be hiding in Iran?  Or is it Afghanistan?<br>  <br>  Duh....|`|KF48OjyDaa	he said throughout the campaign that he was going to send more troops to Afghanistan|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	Maybe because the name Obama sounds like Osama, and Barry is embarrased that he is not getting Osama.<br>  <br>  OBAMA IS NOT IN AFGANISTAN he is in Pakistan.  That is why Barry is bombing Pakistan. <br>  <br>  Ask yourself why the incompetent Barry Obama is bombing our military ally Pakistan if he really thinks Obama is in Afghanstan?  The man is deranged.<br>  <br>  So why is Barry sending 17,000 troops to Afghanistan?  Good question.|`|BHBQPFzlaa	Fighting in Afganastan makes infinitely more sense to me than fighting in Iraq. The taliban is sympathetic to al-queda, and other groups that are a threat to the livelihood of our country.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you seem to be opposed to senseless military action, like the war for oil in Iraq. What a terrible economic, moral and political mistake it was to ever send our troops there in the first place.|`|e19ukSO0aa	Because that is where Al Qaeda actually is. You know, NOT Iraq?

Up to this day $$$ is still manipulating people in regards to these synthetic sugars. I posted a link from youtube for your pleasure.<br>  <br>  The amount of money needed to build a case against aspartame would be tremendous and with people being paid and manipulated, it would make it impossible for any law firm to even consider taking a case like this.

After some time, I began having a lot of headaches off and on and my vison got worse. I couldn't determine the cause. After I researched aspartame, I was shocked. Class action lawsuits should be filed against manufacturers of products containing aspartame. Donald Rumsfeld was the person who lobbied the FDA to get it approved in the 80s.

Bill Hicks RIP<br>  <br>  One needs only to look at the 2008 election process, specifically the John McCain/Barack Obama debates, to see the glaring similarities between the parties' chosen candidates.  For this exercise, we shall look at foreign policy and education.<br>  <br>  On foreign policy, McCain maintained that a continued US presence in Iraq is necessary. Obama countered by saying that it was time to leave Iraq, but a continued US presence in Afghanistan is necessary.  At first glance, it would seem that the candidates differ on the position of war.  However, neither major candidate really offered an alternative to war; they only differed in their opinion on where armed conflicts should happen.  Neither Obama nor McCain mentioned a non-interventionist policy; instead, it seems that both candidates solely supported continuing armed conflict.  In this way, no matter which major candidate won the election, a war-oriented President would be elected.<br>  On education, Obama asserted that disadvantaged youth should receive the opportunity for government assistance to assist them in paying for higher education.  McCain countered by suggesting that an already-in-place school voucher system (government money given to those electing to send a child to a private school) would help more.  Again, both candidates appeared to differ on a point on which they actually agree: that the government should offer financial assistance in the educational sphere.  Neither candidate addressed any other alternatives (abolition of public schools, nationalized colleges).|`|2e36923da51c815eb4096942999c182baa	Look up a comic called Bill Hicks<br>  <br>  "I like to puppet on the left ....<br>  I like the puppet on the right ...<br>  Hey look, there is one guy working both puppets ...<br>  Go back to sleep AMERICA ... your government has everything under control "<br>  <br>  Ya ... heavy!<br>  .
OiAl6w48aa	You can only fire the attorney if your daughter is a minor, or you have some sort of guardianship for her.  If she is legally an adult, then she is the only one who can fire him.  It does not matter if you are paying the bills or not.<br>  <br>  Edit:  You can personally fire him before she turns 18.  After that, just to be on the safe side, why don't you write a letter terminating his services and BOTH of you sign it?  And keep in mind, your daughter will need to be the one to personally retain the next attorney.  You will still be able to pay for it, but the attorney's primary responsibility will be to her, not to you.  <br>  <br>  Before you do any of that, I would suggest you try having a meeting with your attorney to voice your concerns and ask about why he's taking the actions he is taking.  If he can't answer to your satisfaction, then can him.|`|2lFRYr8Eaa	If she is over 18, no, under 18 yes.  If over 18 it is your daughter's choice.  Also, a couple of years have passed.

He might know something that you need to know.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	You can probably have who ever you want represent her, however you need to check the contract you have with the attorney.

One legal issue could be negligence if there's no one trained in first aid present at these non sanctioned amateur boxing matches. <br>  <br>  What if a fighter gets knocked out? Is there someone there who can determine if the person has suffered any significant injury? There's a potential for some big time liability issues here especially if there are minors involved.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	If it is not legal it should be.

There should be gloves, mouth peices, probably even the head gear. <br>  If it's bare like street fighting then it's illegal for sure.<br>  <br>  Boxing is legal if no on is betting... and if the people who are going to fight sign an agreement just so that if they get caught they can't turn on each other. Or if one ends up in the hospital that person can't sue. But... if cops come in and bust in on the fight they will search for everything just to put you guys away. They'll do a body search even a house search and if they find something it depends on the cops how they want to go about it. They'll most likely take the people that has illegal things and the owner of the house will go along. If there are minors I think that's a different level of hell, because if they're involved in a fight and they're fighting an 18+ year olds.

swiOhDo2aa	Probably you are right. There is always a temptation, when you receive money for nothing, not even to try to contribute to the rest of the world.<br>  <br>  This is why subsidies to industries as well as welfare payments to individuals are dangerous: perhaps on occasion necessary, but always risky.<br>  <br>  A (non-human) case in point. Wild sheep work hard for survival; they are combative, wary, intelligent and hard to catch. They have a strong loyalty to the herd, and protect each other when the wolves appear. On our farms the sheep are subsidised (or if you prefer, on welfare). In winter the farmer hays them, pellets them and shelters them. <br>  <br>  The result? The big softies  can be herded by one dog. (How much chance would a lone wolf have in the wild?) They live to be sheared, over and over, and will line up one at a time to end up on someone's plate.<br>  <br>  Governments know this better than anyone. Why do you think they train us to eat out of their hands? Do you want to be clipped of your money? Where do you want to end up?<br>  <br>  Yes, we need government: but there is moderation in all things.|`|3c7af99d45cd29de4b5830261c158f92aa	It hurts two ways. One, because the government produces nothing. To handout money (wealth) it has to take it out of the hands of the people producing it. It's not an option, it's not voluntary, it's taken out of your hands by force.<br>  The other is what you mention. People living on welfare has no needs, no incentives to do anything positive with their lives and too much free time. The "good" ones will work on the informal market, the "not so good" ones will slack all day long, the "worse" ones will get involved in crime to get some more money. But they're all BAD. If you live supported by the effort of others and you don't feel the shame and move your butt to get a job, you're a looser.|`|eipN6IoMaa	Yeah... Government handouts do hurt people. They start off as Charity, then People start thinking of them as being entitlements... and they become dependent upon them. They forget how do do for "self" , and start making excuses as to why they are not working (ex."Because, they will cut off my foodstamps...etc... if I start making over such and such money"). Government handouts also hurt people because it taxes workers to get the money to pay for the handouts (to usually those who are not working... or those who did not save for hard times). Corporate welfare hurts people too. That is a handout.|`|dseGQ1Jlaa	government handouts are whats wrong with this country.  Too many people believe they are entitled to a house, a car, a high paying job, etc. just because they live in the United States.  This is the land of opportunity for people who are willing to work hard and earn what they have.  It is sad that some people cant afford a house or a decent car, but this is America, and they have every opportunity to better themselves if they are willing to work hard. Its upsetting to see people who refuse to work and get welfare actually come out better than someone busting their butt for minimum wage 6-7 days a week, very upsetting.  Like JFK said, "Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."  We need to be in this mindset at all times, but many people just sit back and expect the government to fix all their problems.  Most of the time, the reason people are in a poor position is because THEY made bad choices and put themselves there.  It is not and has never been the governments job to fix our personal problems, it is there to protect us from foreign invaders and to protect our civil liberties, it is up to us to fix our own problems.  People need to wake up and stop sucking the life out of the ones who do earn what they have.|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	Kevin Dudd 2010|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Good god.

2lFRYr8Eaa	I have to disagree with the heard.  If you are, say arrested for DUI, and then in the morning they give you a citation, and they forget to have you sign it, you are not on legal notice for the court date.<br>  <br>  My point is, they, the hotel, created the contract.  You cannot edit it, so it is a contract of adhesion.  Next, since commonly, hotels have smoking rooms, they would not have a person initial the penalty for smoking in the room.  Therefore logic dictates that their not having you sign initial the penalty clause, your defense is you thought it was a smoking room.  <br>  <br>  Lastly, they cannot tack on a bunch of other charges if there is a small claims court, since the charge they add if you smoke in a non-smoking room is what THEY feel is their cost for the damage you did.  Or anyone else.  Now if you told the credit card company that you knew the room was none smoking, you are toast.|`|AA11622716	They will side with the hotel.  Initialling is just so they have stronger evidence that you actually read the agreement.  Whether you read it or not, you signed it.|`|htSZsds7aa	Trying to outsmart them is not in your favor, u still signed a contract, so own up and pay.|`|2zGSdDvIaa	You are SOL.<br>  <br>  Initialing is just added defense on the part of the hotel.  You can take it to court if you wish, but they can throw in additional charges at that point.<br>  <br>  cleaning<br>  changing air filters<br>  cleansing <br>  cleaning apolserty <br>  scrubbing the walls<br>  etc<br>  etc<br>  <br>  If they want to gert menat the fees could go over $1,000.<br>  <br>  Fight it if you wish.  Next time, either get a smoking room or don't smoke.|`|CowgOqXTaa	When you sign the contract you are bound to the contract - the WHOLE contract. <br>  <br>  The "initial here" bits are just to stop people coming down to the desk and arguing "well I didn't notice that bit!". It's for their convenience only - not noticing is not a defense at law. <br>  <br>  Richard|`|nbibIzC5aa	You signing the contract represents that you understand the terms and conditions of it, including the fees for violating those terms.  Even by your statement, you state that you knew that you could not smoke in the room.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	If there is a BIG NO Smoking sign anywhere in the Hotel, there should be NO reason to ask you to sign any kind of a document except the sign in sheet  What a bloody nerve! I think I would have told them to shove their room where the sun don't shine! BUT If you paid by credit card, they've got your number!! They can slap whatever charges they want! What puzzles me is, how did they find out you were smoking? Did the Fire alarm go off, or someone sneak into your room when you weren't there!? A sniffer detective!!!??? I would suggest, you either go find another hotel who doesn't have such stupid rules, OR use a phony name and ALWAYS PAY WITH CASH! They can't trace green backs!!!  If anyone ever asked me to sign such documents, I would tell them straight, you are NOT buying the room, only renting it for the night! And THEN tell them, OK! now I want to inspect the room for cleanliness and infestation! (Bed Bugs!) Always look behind the bed head board, and inspect the mattress! Any black marks on it, you will be a late night dinner for those little blood suckers! Heh! I've been bitten! and it's NOT funny! If you are lucky enough to find any, you can sue the Hotel, then fire the whole bunch of hypocrits!
BphZi9yDaa	I don't really know the answer to your question b/c everyone's experience in the army is different. but depending on the training, your soldier should get some passes(usually weekend) and you can visit(sometimes they cant come to you theres a restriction on the miles they are allowed to go away from post) the only time i wasn't able to see my husband was while he was in basic(which was in ky,where we are from), then during the week at officer school(for 12 weeks in GA). but on the weekends he got passes after being there for a couple weeks. Theres a really good website for military spouses and families that has been helpful to me... www.militaryonesource.com you may be able to talk to someone who's in your exact situation or has been before.|`|s5lj3ENhaa	Well here is my experience.....when he gets to his first unit depending on how they are it will be like any other job except when they are in the field training. My husbands unit prior to deployment they were in the field training quite a bit but other than that he was home every night....just because he joined the Army doesn't mean you will never see him it just means there will be periods of seperation.<br>  <br>  P.S. don't expect to see him during training except on family day between Basic and AIT they don't get weekend passes to go off post or anything they can stay on post but the privileges are based on how well they are doing<br>  <br>  Seriously what is up with the thumbs down?

Expect a few letters from him and even fewer phone calls. Expect a small paycheck from him.<br>  <br>  You will not get to see him until Graduation day. Then he ships off to his first duty station. Hopefully he does all the paperwork so his orders include you and his child.
9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	You won't see anyone while they are in Basic...<br>  Once done and he's at his first duty station, see him all you want (when he's off duty).<br>  <br>  He's lucky, my OSUT was 18 weeks<br>  <br>  There is no AIT for your husband. He is doing OSUT (One Station Unit Training). It's Basic and AIT combined|`|s5lj3ENhaa	At family day between Basic and AIT... they have no contact with anyone except with other soldiers....he will be in the midst of training and will not have a ton of free time....when my husband was in training I saw him on family day and on the day of his graduation you just tough it out until then<br>  <br>  Yes it's OSUT but there is still a family weekend between the start of what is considered Basic and the start of what is considered AIT...you will be able to see him then and then again at graduation I'm pretty sure that hasn't changed in the few years since my husband was at Ft. Knox for training in fact I am pretty positive
tDvyf3Q5aa	This is just a policy by Zion lobbies to make the facts upside down and as far as I see they have been so successful. Based on 2007 National Intelligence Estimate report on Iran, Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons program years ago (google it). This was simply ignored because Israel needs Iran to be displayed scary to make Israel an innocent victim and continue the war crimes. <br>  <br>  It will not take that long to see the real economical effects of these evil wars; see the US Financial Report here to understand what is going on:<br>  <a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/fr/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fms.treas.gov/fr/</a><br>  <br>  you can find out that the budget deficit which is declared to be $455 billion is just because of "few finishing touches" and it in fact is: 5,100 billion. <br>  <br>  another war just because of the misleading propaganda?

So they signed it and Hitler agreed to be a good guy and not attack Europe.<br>  <br>  Well, one year later....there he goes. Adolph Hitler rolling into Poland. Oops! "Peace in our time" MY @SS!

This is the person who makes the decisions about health care, which treatments should be provided, which medicines to take, etc.  <br>  <br>  You will have to determine which power of attorney you aunt has.  You will have to prove that she is not doing what she should be doing.  Just because you don't like what she's doing doesn't mean it's wrong.  Also, there was probably a reason that your father named her as his power of attorney, you'll need to respect his wishes.<br>  <br>  All that being said, if you really feel there is a problem, you will have to file a petition with the court and have a hearing.

BGPfLOmYaa	The Marines are the best! Hands down. There is a reason they call them "The Few, The Proud". They also have the best looking "dress uniform". :)  I guess the cons would be that it is much more of a challenge. Their bootcamp is longer than the other branches of service and their motto is :Every Marine is a rifleman". EVERYONE. From cooks to paper clerks. Think about it this way, if a person joins the Marines and goes to Marine bootcamp and does their time and gets out of the Marines and decides to join another branch of service....you get to skip their bootcamp!! You are considered to already be trained above and beyond their bootcamp. BUT, if you join ANY other branch of service and do your time and get out and then decide to go to the Marines you WILL have to do the USMC's bootcamp because the other branches of service's bootcamps and training are not considererd sufficient enough for a Marine. I am a Marine Corps wife and very very much a Marine Corps SNOB! LOL.  If you want to take the easy way out join the Airforce or the Navy or the Army. If you want to be one of the BEST, join the Marines. But please know that it IS harder. We call the Airforce the "country club".  When we went to visit a friend whose husband is Airforce I wore my USMC T-shirt and everyone stared and asked me questions. LOL. They think we are crazy to be married to a Marine but I wouldn't have it any other way.<br>     As for joining go to a recruiter. Be forewarned that the recruiter for any branch of the service will tell you how great theirs is and bad the others are. They will tell you they don't have a quota to fill but they absolutely do!! They don't get paid more for getting recruits but if they don't meet their quotas  then they get bad fit reps (reports) and that can affect their promotions. And in any branch of the military your pay depends on your rank. AND, there is a huge myth that some branches pay more than others. That is absolutely FALSE! Your pay is based on your rank and nothing else. You only get extra money for special things like combat pay if you deploy and things like that. Or if you are married and you get deployed you will get seperations pay (250 a month) for being seperated from your spouse. Do your homework, don't fall for the BULLS**T. Every recruiter will do everything in his/her power to get you to join their branch. Including taking you out to eat, so ballgames, to cookouts blah blah blah. They get a credit card , their expense account, to do that stuff to get you to join. So, the Marines are the best but also the hardest with a longer boot camp and harder training. But once you get past that hard part you get a level of respect that you have never experienced before. The Army not so bad but still not Marines, there is nothing so gross and an overweight soldier wearing his cammies and you see that a lot in all branches of service BUT the Marines. The Airforce is the easiest, especially physically. The Navy you prolly don't wanna do unless you wanna be on a ship with a thousand other stinkin dudes for MONTHS at a time. Eww. LOL. Oh, your recruiter will give you a test called the ASVAB. Your score on that test will determine your job in the military. If you score low you might end up a "grunt", which means front line combat, rifle carrying, door kicking in, like you see on tv dude. If you do well on the test you can do just about anything including electronics, computer repair, airplane technicians...the possibilities are endless. Now, I know kicking in doors sounds like fun BUT remember this..and this is VERY important...when your contract is up and you have the choice to get out or reenlist if you got a "good" job (meaning you had a high asvab score) they might offer you a reenlistment bonus. The first time my husband reenlisted we got 13,000 (11,000 after taxes). The second time he was in Iraq (and when you are deployed your bonus $ is tax free) we got $50,000. Yup, you read it right. But remember that he has a job that required the military to train him for a year. So, study, get a recruiter to help you with what you need to study and get a good asvab score. It does matter. Sorry I rambled, I kept thinking of things to tell ya! :P<br>  Semper Fidelis  (USMC motto wich means Always Faithful)|`|Q8GFvklUaa	If the Mission were to break in to a secure building <br>  <br>  The Navy would use tools and diagrams to cut the locks<br>  <br>  The Marines would charge the doors, ram them, throw stones, kick, scream and keep doing it till either their body's or the building was wrecked<br>  <br>  The Army would recon the building, devise a detailed plan, and exploit the building's weakness<br>  <br>  The Air force would call a locksmith and go to McDonald's till the locksmith was done.<br>  <br>  I know that's not a real answer but that's how each branch is trained to think, so you can reach a conclusion based on that.|`|XC7qQJ0Haa	The few.

You would be a part time soldier. <br>  <br>  4. Talk to a recruiter, a lot of paperwork, ASVAB testing, physical testing @ meps. Swear in. National Guard members go to drill one weekend a month, and 2 weeks a year. As they said at MEPS when I went. the only people considered soldiers right after they swear in are National Guard because they have drill that month too. <br>  <br>  It really all depends on what you want to do. If you want to be pushed to limits and beyond, are strong mentally and physically, want to have a bond with people that will last a lifetime, go marines.<br>  If you are more smart than strong, and want to be able to advance according to your head, then maybe airforce is for you. <br>  If you're a little bit of both and neither of those seem fit for you, try Army.<br>  And finally if you don't want to do any of them and you dont get seasick, go navy!<br>  <br>  That is very very very summed up, just research like crazy, talk to individuals from each service and see what their experiences are like.

My problem is asthma, and I can only go by the similarities on that. What they do (this is also answering a previous question) is once you've done that ticklist they'll then send that to your doctor/ GP and they'll either confirm or deny the validity of the form so I cannot stress enough how you can't lie on the form becuase medical records, given to the right people, anything can be found and that is something that will definately show up (I mean I got a form of when I got last prescribed an inhaler, down to the day)<br>  <br>  In terms of arthritis, I'm not sure how they'll do it, I mean what they may do is get the records - then see that it's not severe and then give you certain tests to see if it causes too much hassle - but I'm not too sure. The TA, I've heard, are more relaxed in terms of their physical ability needs (I mean they're still strict in the sense you need to be able to do the same minimal requirements as the army, but it's only (as I'm sure you already know) a part time basis...)<br>  <br>  What I suggest is just to talk to a recruiter about it, they'll be able to shed more light onto it - don't beat around teh bush (the questions I came out with I think I gained respect for the fact that I wasn't beating around the bush, I was honest and got to know everything I wanted to know... lol)<br>  <br>  What I can do for you though is on the 5th of March I'm going away with a batallion of the East Anglian regiment (for like a day out... like an open day for people interesting in joining (get to fire a rifles and stuff apparently (:-D lol))) and what I can try to do is gather information on it if you wish, I'm not sure how much I'll be able to get but I can just ask around, my recruiters, people there etc (I mean it's an actual barracks... so I'm sure I can get some info :-P)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps - sorry for the essay lol

Remember these names "Agony, Misery, and Heartache." He'll meet them, know them, hate them. They are the three hills at Knox he will road march on previous to graduation. (shudder. . . bad memories.)<br>  <br>    You'll hear from him, but basic is the most silent time in the military. He'll be busy with a capitol B. <br>  <br>    PS: My soldier just told me that when he went to Knox two years ago, they got to call a lot. If your platoon acted right. So, if he doesn't call, he's in a platoon with a bunch of S**t birds. <br>  <br>  WRITE him alot! They used to make us do push ups for mail. I heard you can't do that anymore, but I used to LOVE watching dudes get six or seven letters a day. Awesome fun. (wait, I've just been told that doesn't happen anymore. I was also told to stop living in the past.)<br>  <br>   Tell your hubby thanks for his service, and honestly, thank you for yours.
IPpOd2wmaa	In Illinois they are supposed to be taken out.|`|X05GAaLeaa	Wow<br>  Most men get out of paying child support<br>  You mean this one acctualy will be forced to pay by the government???<br>  RIGHT ON!!!!|`|UdICTUnaaa	yes, if his check was previously garnished for child support, it should also be on his unemployment check. if not, you're gonna have to talk to a lawyer if he is not cooperative.<br>  child support will be garnished from all kinds of checks, social security, disability, unemployment, taxes|`|0ZTrJaRLaa	No, child support payments cannot be deducted from unemployment benefits. Child support is enforced through the employer for which he is physically working. <br>  Unemployment benefits are monies (assistance) issued based on his last years earnings. In other words the state cannot take away from the state.
PVMsr2Faaa	No to both questions, sorry.|`|sGthQMFtaa	Your going to prison....
Rk4TMr3taa	NO HAVEN'T SEEN THE REAL ONE YET makes you wonder. its amazing the links people go to to to avoid the truth. and its a law but what are laws anymore. they would do anything to get a black man in office|`|q4EXFhV7aa	There is no controversy....just stupid conspiracy theorists. All lawsuits have been thrown out. FYI: When Sean Hannity stops believing in your claims, you KNOW for certain that they are completely radical and WAY out there.|`|AA10045620	Nope.  He has not.|`|T8nap2Pnaa	No state posts birth certificates for public display. Wouldn't matter anyway, as no matter what he does, you won't believe it. By the way, if there was anything to this, would anyone care to explain why the Bush adminstration, with its complete control of the Federal justice system, never said one word before or after the election?|`|S6XSLvjLaa	Never showed the original.  That one has been sealed.  Hmmmm|`|z4V9kdR8aa	This has been resolved already.  He is a US-born citizen.|`|yiPZ1UZAaa	WOW you Republicans are still discussing this? GROW UP!
RD5sTZaFaa	Having a conviction for a theft offense on your record will haunt you for the rest of your life. You will be prevented from serving on a jury, and if you are ever a witness in a case and required to testify in court it can be brought up by the other side to impeach your testimony. This would be very embarrassing if done in front of a jury. In many cases you will likely be passed over for jobs or promotions in favor of the one without the theft conviction.<br>  <br>  Theft is a "crime of moral turpitude", meaning that a conviction for theft shows the world that you have very little moral fortitude.<br>  <br>  Fight to keep this off your record, and if you need to get into counseling to prevent your doing this in the future then get into counseling.<br>  <br>  If you plead guilty, even if you only have to pay a fine, it will be on your record for the rest of your life. If there is some sort of probation (sometimes called deferred prosecution) where your case is dismissed because you complete a theft class then with your attorney's advice, you might consider it. <br>  <br>  Be sure that your case will be dismissed. In Texas we have that, we also have "deferred adjudication" probation, where you go to court and plead guilty, the judge finds there is sufficient evidence of guilt, but deferrs adjudication and places you on probation. If you complete the probation then the case is dismissed. If you are placed on probation under these circumstances the case stays on your record, but shows it was dismissed. You can go back to court to get an order of "non-disclosure" where no one can see the court file, and it gets sealed from your record, but that is expensive, and may not be granted. <br>  <br>  If you do a deferred prosecution then if the case is dismissed, at some time in the future you can go back to court and have it removed from your record under a process called "expunction", but not before the statute of limitations has passed.<br>  <br>  You could agree to plead guilty to something else, like trespassing or some other crime that is not a crime of moral trupitude, maybe, but if you plead to theft it will be on your record.<br>  <br>  In California, a misdemeanor is a crime with a range of punnishment of less than 1 year in jail, and there might be a fine, if you are facing possible jail time (and you are) you are entitled to have an attorney appointed by the court to represent you in this case.  Petty theft is a misdemeanor charge carrying up to six months in jail, a fine of up to $1,000, or both. <br>  <br>  And don't steal, it is wrong.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|d4e41d3df62e651aeb95bc6da71e5eacaa	What can you do? Let's see now, you openly admit to stealing someone elses property, and instead of asking how you can pay for the crime you're asking how you can get out of it. Right! You should go to jail and hopefully learn that civilized people don't normally steal other peoples stuff.|`|f624b66aaed0290aaf76eedf3378ad4caa	Go to Jail.  Go directly to Jail.  Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.|`|2xUNIc73aa	Well, that was dumb.  Are you a minor or an adult?<br>  <br>  You will be required to make restitution-- either the property, or cash value, or equivalent in community service.<br>  You will probably not serve jail time for a first offence unless you behave badly before the judge.  He can do a lot for you or to you.  Time in jail or a fine up to $1000 is totally up to the judge.<br>  You may ask for a public defender if you truly can't afford a lawyer.<br>  You will need a lawyer eventually if you want your record expunged.<br>  <br>  <br>  "...490.1.  (a) Petty theft, where the value of the money, labor, real<br>  or personal property taken is of a value which does not exceed fifty<br>  dollars ($50), may be charged as a misdemeanor or an infraction, at<br>  the discretion of the prosecutor, provided that the person charged<br>  with the offense has no other theft or theft-related conviction.<br>     (b) Any offense charged as an infraction under this section shall<br>  be subject to the provisions of subdivision (d) of Section 17 and<br>  Sections 19.6 and 19.7.<br>     A violation which is an infraction under this section is<br>  punishable by a fine not exceeding two hundred fifty dollars ($250)..."|`|feCw7TFWaa	lol ur lucky it was less then 500 i beleive if it was over u would do jail time... depends how old r u? <br>  <br>  underage u might just pay a fine...<br>  <br>  remember these words " i learned my lesson and ill never do that again"<br>  <br>  best thing to say infront of a judge trust me<br>  <br>  <br>  u will get a fine and court cost thats about it<br>  <br>  ask a lawyer on how to remove it from ur record it can be done if it is ur first|`|uSeApMt9aa	Not really a serious offense. A kid i know stole 7 coats from a store and they were valued at a high price. He is doing 4 years. So your best bet is stop now while your still a petty thief. If you can't afford a lawyer one will be appointed to you free of charge.
aMOWPRaCaa	Your family is just worried for your saftey.  What you take from your MOS is up to you. Not from personal experience, but being 11B gives you an invaluable chance to be a leader.

hmA8nfA2aa	Any branch would be great. Having military experience almost always gives people an edge when trying to become a police officer. Having military experience is a great asset if you want to become a police officer. It doesn't really matter what branch you choose. You should explore all of them, and try to determine which one you would enjoy more. If you want to become a police officer, you should also consider earning a college degree before, during, or after your time in the military. Many people earn college credits and/or degrees while in the service. There are many things to consider when thinking about becoming a police officer. There are many things that you can do to increase your chances of becoming a police officer.

I also know some officers that went to boarding school their junior and senior years of high school that prepped them for. You should probably read a lot of books from soldiers too, like check out the bookstore's "Military" and "Military History" sections and read about all the experiences that past soldiers have gone through. You can learn from them now until you have your own experiences. Good luck to you!|`|9sXlZWGqaa	Best thing u can do is get good grades in school the military don't like dumb people.

I've heard that you can sometimes fly on them if their is extra room.|`|jthpq6Egaa	You can virtually fly for free on military flights (Space Available).  Mind you, there is an order of merit list (those on emergency leave go first and so on and so forth, including first come, first serve).  Plus, you need to be on leave (many servicemembers don't realize this).  Keep in mind that it may be a couple of days before you and your family are manifested on a flight.  My recommendation is to go to your nearest military airfield and get all the information from them.|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	Space Available.

Another key phrase is Space Available meaning if after all the people assigned the flight get on if there are seats available you can get one; you cannot reserve a seat or groupf of setas so if three are left and their is four of you then one stays behind.  Also is a priority system to a degree for Space A-if an active military person is on emergency leave they always go including bumping a scheduled person off, military on leave next, then dependents.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	I beleive the DoD still offers "space-available" transportation for active duty military and overseas dependents.  You have to be able to handle commercial transportation if you get bumped on a contracted (or military aircraft) flight.  It used to be free but there might be a small fee, now.  Check with your Personnel office.|`|ypSp9ieKaa	its true, but its a military flight, and you cannot schedule in advance. you have to show up when the flight leaves, and if they have seats, you can get on for $20|`|BIwZ7klfaa	they're called MAC flights (Military Airlift Command)

That means that, like all contracts, if that's what it says, and you signed it - you are bound to it. <br>  <br>  In 'most' States the default law on a lease is that unless agreed to by both parties, at the end of the lease period it automatically converts to a month-by-month tenancy. <br>  <br>  If, however, it includes language that (Just for example) "At the end of the lease period, unless either party gives 30 days notice to the contrary, this lease will automatically renew for an additonal 12 months at the same terms." then that is what will happen.<br>  <br>  Such automatic renewals are almost always found in commercial leases, and less commonly in residential ones.<br>  <br>  Richard|`|ZaLrtSd7aa	If it's in the lease you're bound by it - in fact you'd need to both initial by the change to remove it. Usually though all my automatic renewal had a notification a month or two prior, and if you didn't opt out it would automatically renew. Did you not get a notification?

Yahoo would do well to take a lesson from google.  Employ a younger team of visionaries (more like Obama thinking.)  Do what google does with it's employees.  allow 20% of their time dedicated to creative and ideas brainstorming and work.  80% on the existing work.

However, it is important to keep in mind that the Electronic Theft Act is very rarely enforced, and its effectiveness is clearly debatable.  Obviously piracy hasn't gone down since the ETA was passed in 1997.  <br>  <br>  I doubt anyone is shaking in their boots at the thought of being prosecuted under the ETA. If I were another country, I certainly wouldn't look to the ETA as a guide to implement a similar law.

A great example. 95% of all young male violent criminals admitted to playing violent video games. This poll was done by an group attempting to ban violent video games and worked in conjunction with Jack Thompson. Looking at those numbers alone people could easily link playing violent video games with violent behavior. However it was later released that not all the information about the polling was released. To be fair to the poll, they had to interview people other than violent criminals. What they found was, 95% of all  young males play violent video games. When presented with all the data, it changes things  a bit.

It was given as a gift to Emir Abdullah by the British.<br>  <br>  The so-called "occupied" territories of Gaza and Judea and Samaria, known as the West Bank never belonged to the so-called "Palestinians"; Israel won them in a war of self-defense from Egypt and Jordan respectively. Furthermore both countries relinquished their claims to the territories, so whose territory is Israel occupying? The answer is they are not occupied; they are rightfully part of Israel, as is the Golan Heights which Israel also won from Syria in the same war in self-defense.

ctcCPMdCaa	"Capitalism on the way up, socialism on the way down."  Perfect.<br>  <br>  Freedom includes the freedom to fail.<br>  <br>  “Ironically, by transferring the risk of a widespread mortgage default, the government increases the likelihood of a painful crash in the housing market,” Paul predicted. “This is because the special privileges granted to Fannie and Freddie have distorted the housing market by allowing them to attract capital they could not attract under pure market conditions. As a result, capital is diverted from its most productive use into housing. This reduces the efficacy of the entire market and thus reduces the standard of living of all Americans."<br>  <br>  “Despite the long-term damage to the economy inflicted by the government’s interference in the housing market, the government’s policy of diverting capital to other uses creates a short-term boom in housing,” Paul went on. “Like all artificially created bubbles, the boom in housing prices cannot last forever. When housing prices fall, homeowners will experience difficulty as their equity is wiped out. Furthermore, the holders of the mortgage debt will also have a loss. These losses will be greater than they would have otherwise been had government policy not actively encouraged over-investment in housing." <br>  <br>  -- Ron Paul, 2003|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	He expresses a sane and sensible view, in my opinion.

What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.  The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.  When half of the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get what they work for, that my dear friend, is about the end of any nation.

He has no time for political bullsh*t that comes with being an Officer.  He never learned to kiss butt.  He LOVES his enlisted job and he just re-enlisted.  MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING.  He is well repected in his position and has earned many awards and was promoted quickly.

If a city were to use this money to go after illegal aliens, for example, this might be considered to be wasting the stimulus money. If a city were to institute sanctuary statutes for illegals, it would likely be considered a good use of stimulus funds. Neither of these would stimulate the economy, except if the illegals were gone after, the expense of having them here would diminish quite a bit.|`|399be115381734eda49e566fc563731aaa	So far, everything he's said as president has puzzled everybody who is capable of rational thought.|`|fDuCamMraa	Logic and 0bama are the same as water and oil.

"They need this plan to work. They expect to see the money that they've earned — they've worked so hard to earn — spent in its intended purposes without waste, without inefficiency, without fraud."|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	It was yet another "event" to Obama.

He knows that's what the people want to hear.  Politics as usual.<br>  Here in Texas, our Governor Rick Perry is considering not accepting the 9 billion slated for Texas.  He says that if we accept it, the Texas must match that amount within two years.  Texas would be forced to institute new government programs and expand some already in existence.  Texas would also be responsible for full cost to maintain those programs in the future.  <br>  I hope he does it.  I haven't agreed with many of the decisions he has made while in office, but this one I would back him in 100%

AA10032971	Juvenile delinquents should absolutely not be mixed with adult criminals. The more mature criminal will surely cause a significant 'wrong impression' on the youths. With appropriate rehabilitative attention from professional counselors, the youths may be saved. Thus, they may become productive and worthwhile individuals. Peace!|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Yup, maybe it will teach them a lesson while they are young.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	I would say no.  Rehabilitation is probably much more likely amongst juveniles than hardened adult criminals.  Also, being physically weaker would probably make them prey especially to the pedophiles.|`|AA12109395	No, because the juveniles would be susceptible to psychological  and sexual exploitation. Everything from intimidation to extortion to forced sexual acts. In addition, prison populations are basically Universities  for prisoners to learn how to perfect their crime so they are better at it when they get out. Being exposed to the adult population would give juveniles a breeding ground for advanced knowledge in their crime of choice.

YupMCYHlaa	Nobody ever said it should be -free-, the real discussion is just in how we should pay for it.  It really irks me when people like Michael Moore say 'free health care'--all they really mean is that you don't pay when you get it.<br>  <br>  Look, every other developed country has some kind of universal health care system--usually a government insurance program like our own Medicare system.  Medicare in the US saves billions of dollars, it has an administrative overhead of 2 or 3 percent as opposed to 25-30% for commercial insurance.  But it produces the same results and the same customer satisfaction as commercial insurance.  Every other developed country has health care as good or better than ours, at about half the cost.  We could do that too.  Not -free- but a helluva lot cheaper.  In fact if we just expanded Medicare to cover everyone we would have literally hundreds of billions a year.<br>  <br>  People are very averse to a tax increase, so maybe that Canadian style Single Payer system is just not possible.  But there ways of getting universal health care that don't involve tax increases.  Suppose we:<br>  <br>  1.  Regulate commercial insurance to force them to accept anyone, regardless of pre-existing conditions--i.e. not just cherry-pick the healthiest people to insure--and set their rates for everyone in the same pool.<br>  <br>  2.  Figure out how much it costs to insure one person on Medicare, and offer the alternative to Americans to voluntarily buy into this system.<br>  <br>  3.  Let Bush's big tax break for millionaires expire in 2010, as it is already scheduled to do.  With the extra money, subsidize low-income people who can't afford health care.<br>  <br>  Just those things alone would make health care available to everyone in the US, without a tax increase. Insurance companies would SAVE money because they use a lot of their resources in filtering out sick people. Medicare would be expanded.  The cost of medical care would go down because it wouldn't include people who can pay having to pay higher prices to make up for people who can't (which is how it happens now).|`|KKH9y0ECaa	The rest of the western world manage to provide universal health care, so I don't see why it should be so difficult for America.<br>  <br>  The thing which amazes me about Americans is that they are willing to spend trillions in taxes on their defense industrial complex, spend vast amounts on a space program and are willing to spend massive amounts in order to sustain the largest prison population on the planet, but are not willing to help those who are unable to afford proper health care.<br>  <br>  The irony being that those in prison are often afforded better health care than the poorest in American society.|`|FKDv6ycbaa	just look at the socialist republic of canada, the only thing they have the advantage on is drugs are cheaper. They come here for their health care, those that can afford it. the rest take more cheap drugs to forget their falling apart and dieing.|`|SS1VReF0aa	Nothing is free...even if you don't pay for it, someone is paying for it.|`|nkr0Nvemaa	You need to inform yourself. Right now everyone in the US can get free medical help. They have to wait til its an emergency and then go to the Emergency Room and it is paid for with our tax dollars.<br>   We need to deal with reality in deciding these very important issues. One of the unfair advantages that our Auto. Industry has to compete against is foreign companies don't have to pay for health care so it makes them more competitive. That goes for all industries here in America the greatest nation on Earth. Just not in health care we do it as stupidly as possible (worst care at highest costs)|`|q9PVawNyaa	Well it works in every other developed country in the world, most of which have far superior education systems.|`|AA11313983	There's no such thing as free.

Most people are scared to death of that much freedom, however.  They're certain that if left to our own devices we'd all be degenerate homosexual pedophiles addicted to drugs with 19 children we can't feed or provide health care for when they shoot themselves with all our guns.

Bush & Cheney's cronies in Haliburton have made about a hundred billion dollars from taxpayer's money so far.      Other contractors have made huge amounts, also.    While our economy is melting down, someone's pockets are being stuffed with the Iraq oil money, and we're still paying for the "reconstruction" of a country that is in a civil religious war, and takes great delight in death and destruction.    But Bush & Cheney will never pay for anything, and I imagine that their cronies will see that they never lack for money, either.|`|mkMJYIJOaa	Only if you get obama , pelosie and reed to sign it too-as THEY VOTED FOR the IRAQ WAR too.

The House just passed an appropriation for $819 billion dollars and I'm betting before it leaves the Senate it's over $900 billion. 647 pages of prize winning porcine. We don't have enough BBQ cookers in Arkansas to cook all that pork. Let's see if Obama keeps his promise.

When the government tells it's people that they can't do something in public that is perfectly legal, people should start questioning and raising the b*llshit flag. There is no reason bars and restaurants can't be divided into smoking and non-smoking sections, if they have to, make entirely different rooms or invest in good ventilation.   The bars around here took a huge hit, some even closed when the fascist no smoking law came into effect a couple years ago. In my experience, most smokers are considerate to the non-smokers and don't blow smoke in their face.  I'm just curious what will be next. I get offended when people are sitting next to me in a restaurant talking loudly on a cell phone, maybe we should ban all public cell phone use.    And I'm sick of people using the "second hand smoke kills" line.

It's hilarious that Americans call themselves free - the US has more laws on the books than any other country in the history of the world.    Fascism.    The reason for all the little nit-picky laws? To fine you and steal your money. To jail people (if not you - the US jails more people than any other country in the history of the world) and budget taxes, thereby stealing your money. To keep rich class law schools growing and expanding. To keep rich class lawyers in work, even if you're not in work. To keep courts expanding and busy, and steal your money.    Only an idiot could fail to see the obvious.    That's all for this question. If you want to read old news, keep going:    .....................................    When will people awaken?? Tobacco growers are highly subsidized by your government, and millions and billions if not trillions spent by your FDA in regulating the production of tobacco products.     What budgets are built, rebuilt, cycled through, and renewed with conventional annual increase? And what tobacco related illnesses are put to the laboratory in which pharmaceutical industries, subsidized by FDA and government, and what range of nearly useless peripheral medicines are laid out on your Walmart shelves as a result of those outlays and for the purpose of profit out of your wallets? And how much tobacco is exported for profit well out of reach of the FDA, but only after taxed for export? And what tobacco industry and pharmaceutical industry corporate income taxes further build your federal and state budgets - yet beyond the state and federal sales tax revenues gleaned of consumers?    Your government. Your rich class corporate government is the tobacco dealer you are unable to pinpoint right under your noses. Always has been  and your government got their start by blaming England for TEA? Forget Obama. A dealer is a dealer.    And since when have you let anyone tell you what or what not to do?? The advertising gimmicks further rip you off. How much government budget is allocated for these useless ads? Who funds those massive advertising budgets? Who pays for those ads?? And who profits???    Any day now... Any day now... Someone out there just has to awaken.    Edit: There is tobacco all over Japan and Southeast Asia, yet oddly there are no tobacco fields. "Japan Tobacco" is one of the most powerful Japanese lobbies in Japan and in the USA. Where are they getting all that raw tobacco? Who's explaining this??    I think with at minimum a quick glance this comes clear for even an idiot like me.    ..........Someone mentioned diets............    American food industry is in blissful partnership with the pharmaceutical industry. Junk food industry creates the illnesses, and pharmas set off in market schemes to produce worthless chemicals sold to hospitals and department stores.    These drugs are, of course, not capable of curing the unnecessary illnesses. They are rather aimed to temporarily placate the plethora symptoms of the array of illnesses caused on the middle- and poor-classes  by rich-class industry junk food selections. As such, these drugs do not work well anyway and do far more liver damage than any falsely promoted development of health, but the middle class will buy anything their crook doctor advises as in the financial pocket of the pharmaceutical industry con artists.    .....................................|`|4tIZJbNLaa	Non-smokers are the biggest group of whiners in the world.

[and government funded programs to help users stop]    its immoral that such a product only still exists because of economic tie-ins    and its insane that with that in mind, we subsidize (!) the growth of tobacco to ensure that it is profitable and well supplied    are we mixing messages here?|`|ed3479cd30aa26d0499c9236b905e198aa	Yes, I don't understand why people, smoker's or not, are not "nervous" with our Government "laws" about smoking.

Non-smokers are not the whiners here, smokers are the most inconsiderate group of people. We made the choice not to smoke because of the harm it does and we have the right to breath clean air. If you want to smoke, do it somewhere that doesn't affect the non-smokers. I could care less what you do with your bodies, it's your decision to make, but you have no right to force inhaling your poison on me. And as far as taxes go, tough! If you don't want to pay those high taxes on your tobacco, QUIT!  My co-worker was pissed off about that too, so he quit. It's simple as that. You aren't being taxed for a necessity. And you know, I'm also going to have to agree with your statement, "outside is God's air..." It's not your air! We have a right to breathe clean air. So quit your whining about the high taxes and restrictions for where you smoke.

Too many black Americans, in general are living in the past and don't understand that until they quit whining about the past that most of them never experienced and stop looking at everything in a black vs white context they are only helping to perpetuate the problem.  Yes, there is racism still at work on both sides, but until we realize that we are our own worst enemy most of the time and stop pointing fingers, it will never change.<br>  <br>  Color should never be brought into politics for any reason.  You cannot legislate away prejudice on either side and there are as many racist black Americans as there are racist white Americans.  Also, this country is made up of more than just black and white people and racism exists within all color and cultural groups.  <br>  <br>  Its time to get over this petty bull....and realize that there are larger problems that require we stop whining and being ignorant and realize that we are all Americans and need to get it together.

Do you act like every other white guy in the world, or are you an individual? <br>  <br>  They'll stop playing the race card, when there stops being racism.|`|8SFoQvVLaa	Probably for the same reason you constantly rant and rave on this site...<br>  <br>  I think the GOP governors who play politics and skip the stimulus will regret it come the next election.|`|9HRkwzruaa	Well, seeing as they have no facts or statistics (or even reality) to back up their whining, it's really all they have left.  <br>  <br>  C'mon, it's actually worth a giggle sometimes.|`|3KXBzSzfaa	The way some of these race nuts act its no wonder that black candidates can use the race card whenever they can.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	It still trumps anything anyone else can play.|`|cgXX13YVaa	Sounds to me your using the race card.<br>  Stop being a Hypocrite!!|`|qGh1HhPwaa	Obama has an uphill climb with you guys|`|V44ARW4maa	they don't, billo.
m1T2fSnHaa	Thats probably nothing, think about what they say behind our back.  WOW!  They feed on hateful remarks, just like the Rev Wright crowd, Obama did enjoy going there for 20 years, thats over 1000 times sitting listening to those hateful rantings from Rev Wrong!.<br>  Obama will never say anything about Coward thing-  Holder probably heard it from Obama first.|`|b90f0a4c32cc3dde140d446b8bb1d11aaa	Because he feels the same way obviously.  Don't you detect a hate and anger toward the middle class in the U.S.?  I do, and that is because they despise successful people, they despise people that are not on the dole, they despise people who love America, because that goes against their agenda of a Socialist/Marxist state.|`|AA10527991	You should try reading the news story before you start quoting from it.

And that was the most irresponsible, RUDE thing to say to the American people.|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	I'm sure they share some ideas about it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Donovan must be the coward Holder was talking about.<br>  <br>  <br>  Reported :P is not an Answer or a Question|`|8SFoQvVLaa	Holder never made any such statement...unless you think only Whites are Americans.

He said Americans...of all colors and beliefs. Since this is about race baiting for you, and not a real discussion of issues, I'll leave it at that.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	you must have a guilty conscience<br>  <br>  the statement was (AS BELOW-----------------------------------... out the  WHITE PEOPLE part)<br>  <br>  Every year, in February, we attempt to recognize and to appreciate black history. It is a worthwhile endeavor for the contributions of African Americans to this great nation are numerous and significant. Even as we fight a war against terrorism, deal with the reality of electing an African American as our President for the first time and deal with the other significant issues of the day, the need to confront our racial past, and our racial present, and to understand the history of African people in this country, endures. One cannot truly understand America without understanding the historical experience of black people in this nation. Simply put, to get to the heart of this country one must examine its racial soul.<br>  <br>  Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.|`|AA11041009	Holder = Obama's conscience|`|k6hicodfaa	That's not what Holder said.<br>  <br>  Obviously he upset you.  Maybe you shouldn't have such thin skin.|`|t82AcQT1aa	They fear what they do not understand (freedom), thus the name calling.

I get what you're saying but Colorado, Arizona and traveling to Canada are all time sensitive big ticket items.|`|ttNa7fVhaa	I agree... Flying to Colorado was just to put on a show and it was a waste of tax $$'s.  I do agree with him though in that everyone receiving bailout money needs to act responsibly with it.|`|AA11450062	I think it is well worth the money to have a president that wants to talk to the American people and get their input.

Just like Rod Blagojevich and crew.
noo8vpvzaa	She claims that she had so many because she loves her kids so much...BUT, if she really loved them, she would have used the money she spent on invitro to help her mother pay the mortgage so her kids would have a home, instead of paying to have more kids that would have to suffer in poverty<br>  <br>  I don't (CAN'T) feel sorry for anyone who is bleeding because they cut their own arm off on purpose<br>  <br>  @Delina: Suggest she have an abortion?...Are you SERIOUS?...She shouldn't have been implanted with 8 more babies that she couldn't take care of...That was her CHOICE<br>  <br>  People with large families have their kids one or two at a time, and 2-3 years apart...The older ones help with the younger ones...People did it that way for years...They didn't have 14 kids all under the age of 8, there is NO way for one person to take care of that many young kids at once<br>  <br>  The Duggars have 18 kids, ranging in ages from 20 years - 3 months...They are married...They have NEVER used government assistance, or asked anyone for help or money...They work, live frugally, don't use credit cards and have NO debt...THIS is how people raise large families, and I have no problem with that<br>  <br>  I don't care if someone has 100 kids, if THEY support them, not the rest of us.|`|DfK4JSytaa	I am disappointed but not surprised. <br>  <br>  To the unsympathetic segment of the country, the "Mom" is seen as 100 percent selfish and self indulgent. She is a person who thinks about no one but herself, her dreams, what she wants to satisfy herself and make herself happy. Her appetite for fame and fortune is clearly insatiable. <br>  <br>  We treat dogs and cats more humanely than we will be treating these babies. There is no way one woman can take care of these babies feeding, bathing, diapering,and just holding them, nurturing them. And in addition, she already has 6 other children who need a real mother to care for them. <br>  <br>  Did she plan, from the beginning, that she would build, with the help of a business agent,  an "Octo Business"?  Yes. She planned would sell her story and photographs to the papers and magazines, make appearances on television, become a world famous celebrity,write her story for Hollywood, and then hire round the clock nannies, a cook, housemaids, chauffeurs, gardener, laundress.<br>  <br>  Would her Octo Business provide money for a home to house all these children and the nannies? Yes. <br>  <br>  Would the Octo business pay for the vans or station wagons with drivers to chauffeur these children with their nannies to the doctor and  the dentist. Yes.<br>  <br>  There is a pathetic photograph already circulating, the one of her bare pregnant belly protruding. <br>  <br>  Are there some dear souls on this planet that feel sorry for her? Sure. I do. And I feel sorry for the babies and the children they will grow up to be. But I am totally unsympathetic. <br>  <br>  Self indulgent people are usually pathetic. You have to feel sorry for them as they mess up their own lives and in the case of Miss Suleman, the lives of her children,|`|JyeYBNPfaa	NO! That woman is a complete and utter IDIOT! I feel sympathetic towards her children, but never, and I mean NEVER, her!<br>  <br>  And she lives in California! That state is already having TERRIBLE financial troubles and the STATE OF CALIFORNIA (funded by MY TAXES since I live in California) is supposed to pay for that careless idiot of a woman's unfortunate children!|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	They elected Obama.  Im not surprised at anything anymore.  The dumbing down is almost complete and the slaves are growing in number, so of course they would have sympathy for their own.|`|ERxADoBAaa	The woman obviously has mental issues ..I'm not as pissed at her as I am saddened by her state of mind.<br>  <br>  And the fact that her 14 children are going to grow up living off my taxes with a crazy mother is abominable.|`|ZZZgZ764aa	I wonder if the doctors who implanted her consider themselves as enablers?  The woman had six children prior and does not have the means to support herself and her children.  Do the doctors even screen patients?|`|pRpgbuqiaa	I think the woman should be ordered 1,000 hours of community service for every future child she bears. Make it 2,000.|`|w0mE1sOYaa	I'm a bit surprised about that.<br>  Especially after I saw her on TV and recognized that she just had plastic surgery .<br>  Did she paid that with food stamps?<br>  ;-)<br>  poor kids.....|`|7DlT0hGdaa	I think she is enjoying her exploitation of her children and the taxpayers.  I do not like her.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	I agree, she is a disgraceful, money grubbing, beotch.|`|pGAUjHwvaa	Dude, why get upset about this woman and her poor family, don't you have better things to worry about?|`|09aGRz8paa	she is mentally unstable and that is quite obvious.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	get a life loser that mom with kids NO One want her to fail!|`|W0VL46gDaa	Those other 3 were probably fellow moochers.|`|t0mb150gaa	They ones who are sympathetic are the ones who themselves are on welfare/government assistance and believe they should be able to have as many children as they want. The number of people that are against it are the working class who is stuck paying for all these kids. Does that explain the numbers?<br>  I mean have as many children as you like as long as you can financially support them!! And being on government assistance does not qualify for being able to financially support it is making everyone else take care of your responsibility!|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I'm surprised that the number of sympathetic people is that high. She's truly screwed up. She doesn't need sympathy, she needs to be sterilized and locked in a padded room until she realizes children are not collectibles. Her children on the other hand, deserve sympathy.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	No.  I'm not surprised.  I feel sorry for those children but not for her.  She probably needs psychological help...but she apparently has no interest.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	I cant believe any one would feel anything for that wench! She needs to be sterilized and hospitalized as in the loony tunes farm|`|JGpirCtLaa	It's her life, not yours, not anyone else's. Yeah it is said that she has no job, partner, house, blah blah blah. Nobody truly knows her story, so unless you have personally talked to this woman and gotten her story, don't judge her. <br>  She obviously felt it was the right thing to do and has a reason for it, though I'm not sure what that reason was.<br>  From what the media has been saying, I don't feel that it was right of her to have 8 more babies after having 6 already and living with her mom with no job and all, BUT I don't know the whole story and her life is none of my business. So although I may feel that it was wrong, you may feel that it was wrong, we don't know the reasons behind it all.<br>  I hope she works this all out and proves everyone wrong.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tanayrw: I do feel sympathetic to her and I am not on welfare, thanks. I'm 19, in college, with 2 jobs. Don't make such broad, judgmental statements.<br>  <br>  Cheshire Cat: I just watched Dr. Phil about this, her best friend from high school said that the plastic surgery rumors are false, most women's faces swell up during/after pregnancy, esp. their nose. And she said that she looks the same as in high school, her face just looks a little swollen due to pregnancy.|`|AA10152346	My grandmother had 9 kids, my father in law was the youngest of 16. Everyone of my grandmother's siblings had upwards of 10 kids. My front door neighbor has 7. I don't see what the big deal is. It's not too long ago those families were the rule not the exception. Are you suggesting she should have had an abortion?|`|cl9Ghxrlaa	The home she and her parents are living in is being foreclosed on after not making mortgage payments for seven years.

Whether or not Arnold is a good governor or not, the voters will likely go for a change even if no one offers real solutions; folks shouldn't expect things to be easily fixed; they only want it to affect others, not themselves.|`|AA11305474	Darrell Issa ran a campaign to oust our last governor Gray Davis and it looked like Arnold was a fiscally conservative republican so we voted him in.  By the way, Issa was probably severely disappointed because he initiated his own campaign for governor after ousting Davis and was quite surprised when Arnold threw his hat in the ring and pulled off the election.  Joke is on us....|`|7HdgMaOnaa	the answer is simple he is the terminator|`|nkr0Nvemaa	Exact same way Reagan did. People liked them in movies and on TV so they voted for them. It maybe the best example of why there is very little hope for this nation. It will never come back to its glory days.
lvBUl3Zdaa	Nope. I said it the first time I saw him. He was a longtime friend and fund-raiser for Blagojevich, what would anybody have expected? ∠°)|`|82e62204f1233511508a75bdb7acf417aa	Not surprised at all, if you had been paying attention and watching, he was a little too eager to want and accept  the senate seat... Also what does NOT surprise me is how corrupt he is, he is just another one in a long line of obamas  plan!|`|cae903cea51e27b7f33677a9e540a4b5aa	No not at all, you can't put nothing past politicians.|`|QMYNDtHgaa	no|`|QuDQVD9caa	He's Obama's friend or is that just an assumption because they're black and of the same party? I don't think he should have been seated. I am slightly surprised only because I didn't think Blagojevich would take the opportunity to make a self-destructive decision that just digs himself a deeper grave.|`|sKmpJY85aa	No, not at all coming from a one-party City & State...|`|7Z9U4f5paa	Na. but what else do you expect from a guy who gets clammy and nervous when they catch him with his pants down?|`|8Mi15cTtaa	nope - I'm also not surprised that this arrogant liar hasn't resigned.  <br>  <br>  Chicago sure seems to have more than its share of corrupt politicians.|`|hnNyUuDQaa	Nope Burris is part of the Chicago Political Machine and Corrupt and Liar are terms that describe there members.
PWvS7vqPaa	It is like any other military graduation really.  Just wear something nice like a nice skirt and top.  Dressy casual might be a better term to use.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To danieldresen.  Although he will be in his Class A's, generally family and friends are not in formal attire as well.  Trust me, it would look very out of place for her to wear a full length gown to this event.<br>  <br>  EDIT 2: That sounds perfectly acceptable and I think it will look fine.  Enjoy.  And take the time to let your graduate show you around Rucker.  It isn't all that bad here.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	NOTHING!!!!!|`|k6I2qULAaa	well i would say that you would wear nice close . i wouldnt go out on like a dress or anything. i would say maybe a cute top and a nice skirt and heels would be great (: hopee i helped!
AA11963685	Yes, they are.  But at the same time I think he overgeneralized to the point of pain.  I think it would have been much more effective to speak  more positively about it in the first place.  Nobody reacts well to whining or finger pointing and that's exactly what it sounded like.|`|AA10344136	Holder is right, Americans are afraid to express their views on race relations and racism in America because we fear others will decry us as racists.<br>  <br>  I, for one, am NOT afraid what others call me.  And with that said, here's my views of race / racism in America:<br>  <br>  1) Whites are unfairly stereotyped as racists; they're the immediate first race of people one thinks of when the word "racist" occurs.<br>  <br>  2) Blacks are just as--if not more--racist than ignorantly racist white groups like the KKK or Aryan Brotherhood.  There are active organized black dominated member social groups in America who ARE just as racist as the KKK.  I say it's time to expose THEM into social awareness.<br>  <br>  3) The black person's worst enemy are within their OWN community.  Racial hatred simmers within urban black communities, consuming blacks in large scores of numbers; they get caught up and believe they have NO equal opportunities. And this is why scores of them delve into illegal activities like violent crime, illegal drug business and prostitution---with even larger numbers of such criminals flooding our prisons nationwide; they're not in there for being black.  It's time the black community wake up and realize things within their own community they are COWARDS to accept and change.|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	Yep.|`|hTFalwX6aa	HE is a coward and I'm not really really proud of him right now.|`|9b0cad68a36e4bab7dceabd66a337aa3aa	It's too bad Eric Holder was not as color blind as you are when he made his statement because then it would have had some merit.<br>  <br>  It's about the black/white dichotomony because as context Eric Holder speaks about past workplace discrimination. Eric Holder admits that we have made progress in the workplace but it's not enough.He calls fellow citizens COWARDS. Holder admits we have made progress on race, but he wants to continue to bash 'Whitey' and for what? To get inside people's minds? <br>  <br>  That smacks of Gulags & Re-Education camps. I am a person of color, and I have seen good...decent people have their careers and lives ruined because a race baiter has taken some innocent comment, and 'Sinisterized' it! <br>  <br>  In a world like that it's no wonder that many Whites choose to not engage in the issue, and I don't blame them for that choice... <br>  <br>  AS LONG AS RACE BUSHWACKERS LIKE ERIC HOLDER CAN LYNCH THE INNOCENT, WHY EXPOSE YOURSELF TO THEIR SLANDER...|`|35b8ac78ca5c09c7481fe35c062bdfa0aa	I talk about it with no problem. He most certainly talking about all races.<br>  Nowadays, the word racism is a made up word. It is a word thrown ever so quickly into the ring over just about anything. Does it stand for what it once did?  not by a long shot.<br>  The chances a person has, does not rest on the color of their skin.<br>  It rests solely on their ability to excel. A persons circumstances do not define them. Does the person have the determination to do what it takes to get out of their circumstances?<br>   People may claim, that they come the wrong side of the tracks.<br>  And?<br>  So have a lot of others that have made it.<br>  I hope people will stop using the race card as an excuse, or to get a free ride. Find out what your talents are, surround yourself with people of like minds, and dig in. You will achieve and succeed.<br>  To BA: How can you stand to think that way?<br>  excuse the expression, but that is an ignorant way of thinking|`|supRA4eOaa	Last time I checked the Attorney General wasn't in charge of who I spend time with.<br>  He can leave the lectures for his children.|`|3db6387cfc0e238b5e0877910ab9366faa	Why doesn't he try and do some actual work.  I remember that a** clown from the Marc Rich pardon.|`|148b310a495e7b39f22ec12f33bcfa61aa	The reason there’s a vast social gap between whites and blacks is because a huge percentage of the black population is at a lower intellectual level and there’s no commonality that both groups can share, beyond whites taking on a dumbed down attitude and spending a lot of time giggling and scratching when in the company of blacks….and, of course, restricting the conversation to sports or something else other than ideas and abstract thinking.<br>  <br>  Blacks don’t have the same humor; they are abysmally deficient in abstract thinking; they do not and cannot reason nor logic in coherent terms; they’re loud, rude, crude, prone to violence, and they have a serious problem with impulse control. Plus as we’ve seen from literally thousands of news stories, blacks are prone to whining and crying like children if they don’t get their way on everything, and whites are repulsed by bellyachers who want to blame everyone but themselves for their obvious inabilities.<br>  <br>  Crime is another problem. No race on earth has the levels of crime blacks do. Even the higher income types are involved with criminal acts, and a huge majority of them just can’t seem to rise above a primitive class.<br>  <br>  They’re given educational preferences and benefits as affirmative action for school entry as well as grades and diplomas and degrees. As one white professor put it, we have to certify a certain percentage of blacks in the universities or answer for it if we don’t do as expected of us.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	To a degree, yes.

gasquENMaa	Hello Dan. For general shooting techniques and practice, contact the NRA.Org and get a list of gun clubs in your area that offer PPC (practical pistol course), steel challenge, combat, hogan's alley or practical defensive shooting competitions. You can pick up some excellent pointers from experienced shooters plus practice yourself. <br>  <br>  Hello Dan. For general shooting techniques and practice, contact the NRA.Org and get a list of gun clubs in your area that offer PPC (practical pistol course), steel challenge, combat, hogan's alley or practical defensive shooting competitions. You can pick up some excellent pointers from experienced shooters plus practice yourself. <br>  <br>  I live and work in Ohio. We had a shootout a couple years back with the Kehoe Brothers and two state troopers. From the experiences that they went through, the entire state has now switched from Weaver stance shooting to instinctive fire shooting. <br>  <br>  The bladed body and cup and saucer style was used until 1957 ( this was called the FBI method at the time). CHP Officer John Weaver came up with a far superior shooting platform. Strong foot forward. Weak foot 10 inches to the rear. Shoulder width apart. The hips are on a 45 degree angle to the point of aim ( the target) and your shoulders are in line with the hips. Using this method, the strong hand will now stick out a foot farther than the weak hand. Strong hand holding the weapon with the arm straight and locked at elbow and wrist. The weak hand is wrapped around the front of the grip with fingers overlapping the strong hand. The weak elbow is bent slightly downward and the weak hand is pulling back with about 10 pounds of force. Weapon is at eye level. This is an amazingly strong and solid platform that a person can hold without tiring the arms for minutes with no trouble. <br>  <br>  For the last 4 years now, our state has switched to instinctive fire. The body is facing the target, knees slightly bent, body is bent slightly forward at the waist. Both hands are overlapping the weapon in an isocolese triangle ( shoulders are square to the target and they form a triangle holding the weapon.) Both eyes open and not using the sights. You are holding the weapon slightly below eye sight looking over the top of the weapon directly at the target. It is like pointing your finger. Once you have your hand/weapon on the target, you fire. This platform is also stable and allows a VERY fast double tap that is highly accurate to 50 feet. Colonel Rex Applegate designed instinctive fire in 1942 to train city boys to use a weapon in combat and survive when they never had ANY experience with a gun before. It does work. <br>  <br>  I teach instinctive fire to my Officers because this is the allowed method in use. I am a competitive shooter with 330 medals and trophies and have been a Weaver stance shooter for the last 35 years. On my range at work, I use instinctive fire but in competition and by years and years of practice, I automatically still go into the weaver. <br>  <br>  In either case, you will gain some insight and practice into combat shooting techniques. <br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you<br>  Source(s):<br>  Firearms Instructor, Arsenal Officer, Armorer, Use of Force Instructor, Chemical Munitions Instructor, Lifetime NRA member, rated competitive shooter with 330 medals and trophies.|`|AA10565336	Run and shoot.  There is no adrenalin rush quite like being shot at but if you can elevate your pulse to the "Fight or Flight" mode it will give you some idea of what you are facing.  That elevated pulse goes for just about any practice you choose to do but especially when trying to duplicate a "High Stress" situation.<br>  <br>  Shoot more with your weak hand than with your strong hand.  If your strong hand is injured the other one had better work.<br>  <br>  Practice the way you want to shoot and you will shoot the way you practiced.  I fire two and assess the situation.  If you do set a pattern and follow it; it will become a reflex.<br>  <br>  Practice reloading as much as you practice shooting.  A quick reload can be a life saver.  Granted, the average gun fight requires 2.3 rounds from the officer but you should never settle for average.<br>  <br>  Always count your shots.  Dropping the hammer on a dry chamber is a waste of time.  Do it when you practice and you will do it for real.  I'm not in the game anymore but I still count shots while watching TV or any other time.  I have done it so much it is automatic.<br>  <br>  Practice with your service equipment.  If you use a Safari holster in practice and a Bianchi in combat you will have unsatisfactory results.<br>  <br>  Practice getting your weapon into action fast, but never at the expense of accuracy.  "Fast" is fine but "Accurate" is final.<br>  <br>  Don't forget your backup.  If you can't use it effectively, it is useless.  If you are going to carry a second weapon practice with it as earnestly as you do with your service weapon.  Should the need to use it arise everything else has already gone to HeII so be good with it.<br>  <br>  Off the point a bit but if you supply your own equipment, buy good stuff.  The life insurance that comes with the job is really death insurance.  Your gear can keep you alive; it's real live insurance.|`|86dbf689c9539acccd15feefb8b8f2a7aa	stand bladed.  and always use cup and ball technique.

osFEzMy5aa	It might be hard to get one on her since you go to the same school and it was 1 fight.  Unless you can prove that she is a threat and is repeatedly harassing you, you probably wont be able to build a case against her.  You'll have to go down to your county courthouse to file for one and fill out a BUNCH of paperwork.  A judge will review it and decide whether it is something that deserves one or not.  Id talk to someone at the courthouse or a lawyer to see what they think.  But your mom should talk to the principal to see what arrangements can be made to avoid doing this.  Its a pretty serious thing so unless you actually fear for your life, try going about it in a different way.|`|2MVG5StDaa	Neither of you will have to change schools over this.

This girl called me a really bad names and threatened me a lot. It was really bad. I hated school because of her.

There was a lot to say about her but I didn't because I knew I was a bigger person than that and I don't like that done to me. Go to a court to file a restraining order. That's violence!

All this ridiculous talk of restraining orders. If you dont agree with someone keep out of their face. There is absolutely no reason for you to ever speak to the person again, or be in her company. You have got to stop thinking that every one else can fight your silly battles for you. What kind of a silly world have we created for ourselves in this country when ever something does not go our way ,we run off to a lawyer. I have been a lawyer for over 40 years, and I can tell you that only this week I have made more money than your dad has earned in 6 month from idiots that refuse to talk problems(you notice I use the proper word, not issues) through with each other. OK so they or your parents go to a lawyer and you get your restraining order, you think you have won? I dont think so, and that lawyer that did the work will be laughing all the way to the virgin Islands for his holidays.

But they have slightly different meanings.<br>  <br>  Sentence 1 might refer to a situation in which the Slytherins had not actually been given a choice about something.

Did it even occur to you that these people are so upset about something that they're willing to give their own lives (and take yours) over their issues?<br>  <br>  Instead of just labeling a group and calling them "extremists" we as a society need to analyze their strifes and come up with a realistic solution.

Or Clinton or the other Bush or Reagan.<br>  Socialism is a government system where the interest of the "society" is over the rest, even over the member of the society., even over freedom.<br>  What changes is the definition of "society" and the priority of issues.<br>  Some handout huge amounts of money to the "needed" because that's good for society. It's not, is taking wealth out of the market and giving it to those who produce nothing. It damages the workers and encourages non production. Just check the numbers, the welfare system has been growing non stop since it was created.<br>  Some spend huge amounts of money policing the world because the protection of the "society" is important. It's not, it's protecting nobody. It takes wealth out of the market and destroys it in wars for political purposes. It creates mayhem and destruction for no good reason. And it destroys freedom.<br>  Some handout huge amounts of money to companies to companies in order to improve production. It doesn't. It only helps big corporations restricting the market. The lack of diversity damages the salaries because with a smaller number of employers the value of the labor decreases. It goes against competition because the small companies don't get handouts. Check the numbers, industrial production has been going down for decades.<br>  Some spend huge amount of money in public works because that create good things for society and jobs. It doesn't. It creates job positions of small value, high cost and low production. Without the incentive of profit, there's no incentive for efficiency. Government is evidence of that. Whatever is produced is chosen by the government, although some things may be needed and wanted, it's not the market who decides. The world is full of abandoned structures made by governments who thought it was a good idea at that time. That's wealth destroyed for political reasons, taken from the hands of those who produce it. And the jobs created eventually will come to and end. Workers that got used to be inefficient, used to work without supervision, without being evaluated. They end up being supported by the welfare system or failing in the real market.<br>  <br>  No matter what is the orientation of socialism, it's always BAD.

But that's not the only help that UBS has provided Americans. In the 2008 election cycle, the foreign bank's employees and PAC contributed $3.1 million to federal candidates (including candidate committees and leadership PACs), parties and PACs, 54 percent of which went to Democrats. Among all finance, insurance and real estate companies, UBS has given more campaign donations than all but six other companies. It also spent nearly $1.3 million lobbying between 2007 and 2008. <br>  <br>  UBS not only split its funds between Republicans and Democrats, it also made sure to help out more than one presidential candidate in the 2008 election cycle and directed its funds to a few of the higher ups of the finance-related congressional committees. Here are some of the notable recipients. (For a full list of recipients, download the Excel file below. All totals include contributions to candidates' leadership PACs and candidate committees.):<br>  ? President Obama collected more from employees of the company than any other candidate or party committee, bringing in $512,800 for his presidential bid. As a senator, Obama co-sponsored a bill, S. 681, in 2007 that would have gotten tougher on tax havens, and listed Switzerland, among others, as an "offshore secrecy jurisdiction."

KDOIKIq2aa	By the time US forces entered the Great War, it was pretty much down to a quagmire in Europe.  The British was working on building tanks, but German attacks late in the war showed they had some will yet to fit.  The war could of slugged along for some time wasting resources and men until both sides seen this as a lost cause over a long dead duke and declared a mutual truce.  So win most likely no, but a better out come possibly.  If the terms of surrender (or a mutual end of hostilities) were more lenient on Germany they would not have had been in such a low state that lead to a fascist party taking control of the Government and running head long into World War II.|`|56650a55637223b1b968b4235bb50735aa	No. They would have been forced or compelled to sign a treaty that included significant loss of territory.

AA11305474	We have a lot of problems that are entrenched in the way we run our state.  For one, the laws both tax and environmental are not friendly to business.  Second, we have an extremely competitive business climate as a result.  That has led to outsourcing jobs to other countries and hiring of illegal aliens to reduce operating costs and increase profits.  Third, the costs to the state to provide illegals free medical care, free education, free social services and welfare for every child they have on our soil are staggering.  They may pay sales tax, but they use more in resources than they use in services and taxpayers pick up the bill.  One of the reasons we have an unemployment rate that is over 9% is precisely because illegal aliens have taken jobs in the construction trades, meat packing, hospitality, landscaping, stone masonry, etc. that used to be taxpaying, middle class jobs.  We also have widespread unemployment among high school and college kids who used to work fast food but those jobs are also now held by illegals.  That puts strains on our unemployment fund while simultaneously reducing the medicare, worker's comp, social security, etc. that the state collects, hence we have huge budget deficits. Our school system spends millions of dollars on English as a Second Language programs instead of investing in technology or training them for jobs in the competitive global marketplace.  Then, we have stupid voters who keep voting for bond measures without understanding that part of the reason we are in such debt is because we are still paying huge amounts of interest on bond measures we passed in years prior.  Further, as a result of our misappropriation of funds, mismanagement of money and supporting a huge non-tax paying population, moody's downgraded the state which means no one will loan us any money, not even the Bush administration.  Finally, we have a flood of foreclosures on the market for many reasons.  Financial institutions out here presumed that real estate would never cease to increase in double digit percentages.  They invented ninja (no income, no job, no asset) loans and marketing them to people who could not afford the homes they were buying, many of whom were here illegally.  They also freely marketed home equity loans which enabled Californians to borrow against the "equity" they "thought" they had while the real estate values were sky rocketing.  Then the entire house of cards collapsed as the real estate values began to decline, businesses closed, the liquidity freeze meant business could not borrow money to fund inventory and payrolls, people lost their jobs, had no money, defaulted on their loans or left the country to return to their nation of origin.  The flood of foreclosures made the real estate market plummet even further, local governments were not able to fund their budgets because you cannot collect property taxes on a foreclosed home and infrastructure spending came to a screeching halt.  Then, step in the governator and legislature who have been battling out how to solve the budget deficit for months until it escalated to 42 billion and they almost bankrupted our unemployment fund and had to issue IOUs for state income tax refunds.  Now, they are soaking the California taxpayer with an increase in sales tax, adding sales taxes to services which weren't subject to them before, increasing personal income taxes by about 5%, increasing vehicle license fees double and continuing to fund all of the freebies that illegals benefit from.  Ironically, they waited until the senate passed the federal stimulus bill and snagged just about every benefit we would have gotten from that bill.  Even worse, if we save our $13 of stimulus every month, we will still owe the state of CA an additional $1300.|`|YupMCYHlaa	It's a microcosm of the US as a whole.

They have jumped the gun on Emotion control and are out of control on taxes. But the biggest problem is they are so pro illegal immigration That more money is going out on education, welfare, health care, and all the other money that is being raped from the state from illegal aliens that are working for cash, not paying taxes and sending the money back home to bring more of this infestation to Ca. This infestation is even moving north where it will soon create other states to become just like Ca. I worry that the stimulus package will go for construction that will create jobs for illegals which will put this country in more kayos than it is now. My opinion, is make a strong border On the mexico boarder. Give California to mexico and we can put a border there and keep the rest of the states safe from becoming another out of control tax burden do to illegal aliens like Ca..|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	Look at the increases in their budgets over the last 10 years and you will find your answer.<br>  <br>  Year over year, from 2003-2004 to the 2007-2008 budget year, the budget increased a little more than 10% a year.

fAaLjlI0aa	First, the odds of it being thrown out are between zero and nil. You were driving under the influence, and the technicality of the timing of your previous DUI's doesn't negate that legally or morally. You can ask your attorney to argue in court that you feel it is technically a second offense, but I don't think you will have much luck. The fact of the matter is, you have 2 previous offenses, which makes this your third. Call an attorney, say your prayers, and learn to call a cab when you've been drinking. There's no legitimate excuse for driving drunk. You're lucky you didn't harm yourself or someone else.

In Turkey, I stayed in a 5 star hotel, payed by the Gov't, and got paid extra daily, but only 3.50 a day.  In Vegas, I stayed on base with a roommate but it's a good hotel on base, and get 13.80 extra per day.  However my sister squadron stayed off base in a 5 star hotel on the strip, and got 65 dollars extra, per day!<br>  <br>  That's just TDY.  Deployed, we stay in air conditioned rooms with TVs, Xboxs, PS2s, ect. ect.

Most likely they found something in his medical records that he didn't elaborate on when he did his paperwork in MEPS that disqualified him from service. Possibly it is a medical condition that they only discovered due to him being in basic. <br>  <br>  Honestly the only way to know what it was is to ask him when he gets back.|`|c01478a0ce464355e8ad471d5a5c87dcaa	Drugs... they probably would have waited till after he passed his 180 day mark to give him a CH.14 (dishonorable discharge). This way, the very least he can get, is general under honorable conditions. This discharge will not screw him out of a civilian job. If it were drug related, he wouldn't be able to flip burgers at McDonald's. The military is a wonderful job, but it also has many drawbacks should you do something wrong. The medical condition, they may work up paperwork and allow him treatment for it for free, or at least refer him to the right people to have it treated, and he may be able to reenlist after the condition is corrected. You need to speak with him for full details on his case. He isn;t in trouble though.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Whatever the case is, tell him I say thanks for trying, thats all that counts in my book.|`|htaxf1jJaa	yea it could be from failing a drug test but if he has never taken drugs, then that wouldn't be the cause. it could also be because he's not working the his DI's requirements or that he just decided to drop out because he thinks he can't do it or it has too much stress on him. It also could be because of a pre-existing medical condition...but if the military knew about it before he shipped for boot camp, then I don't understand why they would still let him go to boot camp for almost a month then discharge him. it can be anything, honestly.

I actually did find out during my senior year and told the school, I am enlisted, so **** off or I am dropping out. The army prefers a high school diploma and does not want to pay any extra. Stuff like that is annotated on your record. Hell, I wish I knew when I was a Junior. would have dropped out then. But again, recruiters keep this to themselves for their own personal reasons.|`|G6yyceAxaa	the program your talking about is called GED PLUS. it is not a standard army recruiting tool, just a temporary program subject to being ended at any time.  same as enlistment bonuses, and other incentives the military uses to get people to join.|`|7DlT0hGdaa	Dude, who pooped in your GI joe cereal?  Why are you even on here screaming? I bet you are not even in the military.|`|uHlhGAdcaa	Yes, there is such a program.<br>  It's the GED Plus program. <br>  The reason it's not common knowledge is because it's very hard to qualify for it. <br>  If a person wants into the GED Plus program, they will have to:<br>  Be unable to return to school (due to age, credit requirements,etc)<br>  Not have a criminal history that needs a waiver (anything above normal traffic tickets)<br>  Score over a 50 on the ASVAB (isn't as easy as it seems; normal scores roll around 40-50)<br>  Score a high score on the AIMS test (it's an aptitude test to determine your personality)<br>  AND FINALLY... USAREC (our command) closes this option all the time, so it'll need to be perfectly timed when the doors are open.<br>  <br>  If you qualify, yes, you'll be sent to Jackson to complete and earn your GED. After which, you'll be given a job and sent to basic and AIT. And yes, you'll be paid during the whole time.<br>  <br>  So, yes... it's possible. But it's hard. And like was mentioned before, at the last minute the slot could be closed and you're on standby, hoping it'll open again in 2 to 3 months.<br>  <br>  Hope this cleared it up for you.

zlmnfFpYaa	Yes.  The Florida State Supreme Court effectively tried to rewrite state law in determining the outcome of the election.  In doing so, they overruled every appellate decision that had been made, disallowing the attempts by the Democrats to change standing law.  The Supreme Court first ruled in favor of Bush by telling the Florida Court that their decision was flawed and unconstitutional, giving them another chance to rectify their error.  The Florida Court basically made the same decision again.  The second time, the Supreme Court decided that the Florida Court's decision was again unconstitutional (a 7 - 2 decision) and that the time had run out to conduct the recounts, in accordance with existing Florida law (a 5 - 4 decision).<br>  <br>  That final decision is the one that ultimately resulted in Bush getting elected.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Legally, there's no way they acted properly.

Gore kept asking for different kinds of recounts until he got the result he wanted.    The SCOTUS said enough is enough, you've recounted it three different ways and Bush still won.    The consortium of 13 newspapers went in and recounted ten more ways and guess what, Bush still won.<br>  <br>  He was terrible but he won in 2000 fair and square.<br>  <br>  And I still think Gore would have been worse.<br>  <br>  That said - I didn't vote for either of them.

They were the most powerfullest countries in Europe, Dominating the Mediterranean sea trade. Whatever they were trading (I know one was gold) became scarce so the Iberian peninsula felt into an economic crisis while transportation became poor as well. They thought going across the Atlantic would directly take them to the Middle East. The Spanish accidentally made it to Caribbean and then Mexico while the Portuguese landed in south America. They called the natives "Indians" because they thought they had reached India. they conquered and established new cities like New Spain. While back in Spain, they were having the "Spanish Inquisition" where they inspected the country to make sure everyone was Christian. when they found Muslims, they would torture them and do all kinds of weird stuff like they were doing to the Mayas, Aztecs and etc. Muslims were eventually kicked out of Spain.. the rest i really don't know but I think there was eventually some political conflict<br>  <br>  I recommend reading "The Penguin History of Latin America" & "Latin America and Its People" so you can learn what happend more accurately<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Penguin-History-Latin-America/dp/0140125590/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235165035&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Penguin-History-La...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Latin-America-People-Combined-MySearchLab/dp/0205520537/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235165879&sr=1-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Latin-America-Peop...</a>|`|2ZgXnAY9aa	WHY THE HELL WOULD PUT MY PEACEFUL ISLAM WITH SATAN'S RELIGION IN SAME SENTENCE.

7fgATXX2aa	Its pretty simple actually. George Washington once warned us to avoid binding alliances (militarily) it wasn't the militarism of just one country but a bunch of them who were allied together on either side which made the other afraid, and we all know that fear is the path to the dark side. Anywys people with too much power got too scared and BOOM! WW1.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	After Germany walked over France in a short war in the late 1800s, France, Britain, and Russia formed a secret alliance against Germany.  Austria and Germany have always been close, but in the early 1900s they were like brother countries, and so when the heir to the thrown of Austria, Prince Ferdinand, was killed by some Serbians, Austria and Germany invaded Serbia.   Russia considered Serbia to be its protectorate, which means Russia felt it was supposed to protect Serbia, and so Russia attacked Germany even though Germany had done absolutely nothing to Russia.  France declared war on Germany because of their alliance with Russia, and so Germany invaded the netherlands and holland in order to attack the french on their unprotected borders with those two small countries.   Because of that, Britain came to the defense of all three nations.   That is how the first world war was started.   The US did not enter the war for another 3 years.|`|1AwB73H5aa	It wasn't, a complicated weave of alliance between everyone in their mother guaranteeing said allies would step in to help each other made the (domino effect, powder keg, you pick the metaphor) explode after one of those Balkan states got its leader assassinated      armies are not the cause of war, in fact, the bigger the stick, the less likely it is people are gonna want to poke at you    ideological zealots excluded
pcHp7Dgkaa	The first step to skilled immigration is to gain skill recognition for your husband's occupation and that is going to be a problem if he hasn't worked as a panel beater for 6 years and impossible if he doesn't have formal qualifications for the trade. You cannot apply for a skilled visa without first gaining a positive skills assessment.  http://www.immi.gov.au/asri/occupations/...    If he passes the above step and gets a positive skills assessment, he should then look for an employer to sponsor him. He may possibly qualify for independent (unsponsored) immigration, but the whole process will take a lot longer and will be far less certain in the current economic climate. Independent or state sponsored immigration visas also require that he passes a points test and his age and lack of recent experience in the trade will count against him and make it extremely difficult to get sufficient points. See the following new guidelines for information on visa processing priorities:  http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s...  http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/general-s... (points test - 120 needed for independent, 100 for state sponsored or regional).    Business skills visas are also available to people who wish to invest in an existing business or establish a new business in Australia but substantial successful business experience and financial resources are prerequisites.  http://www.immi.gov.au/skilled/business/    If your dad is a citizen or Permanent Resident and depending on your overall family situation, there is an outside chance that he may be able to sponsor you. See the following for details:  http://www.immi.gov.au/migrants/family/1...

You have skills, good english and writing skills.     If i was you i would be getting in contact with the Australian embassy and an immigration agent there.     Just go to the DIMA website. The forms are actually pretty easy to understand. But i think going to an immigration agenty would be so much easier - at least to guide you thru the red tape.|`|yB4o9YD2aa	Hop on a bus, Gus.

Australia need money ....|`|NJMzhcKhaa	skill based migration in Australia is using point system. If your husband trade is on the list, it will definitely help your family fulfil the points necessary for that.    If your father is still there, then there might be even another way of migrating, depend on your father condition and whether he has another family or not already.    Being part of the commonwealth, a UK citizen could migrate here in Australia much easier.  Having money to invest also helps.  (Message me if this end up to be the way you want to migrate here since I'm planning to open a Registered Training Organization here in Sydney)    I would suggest using a professional Immigration solicitor since they might be able to suggest the best way and shortest one to take.

70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	If the letter was dated/issued on Jan 31st with a 3 month period of notification it would require an update/amendment just prior to the end of that three month period.    The letter should be legally binding through the month of April. Prior to the end of April would be the time to re-issue or amend.
2YLjd9uSaa	Any carrier of passengers is required to provide electronically a passenger list. The information provided will include names, dates of birth, citizenship, and document numbers. While the ship or aircraft is on its way to the U.S., the names on the list can be checked.    The names are not discovered at the time of the arrival. They are known in advance.     They are given to CBP electronically, not by a flight attendant or a ship's captain.     This process has not been taking place for the past 30 years.  It was delevoped in the late 1990's and improved upon after 9/11.|`|AA12212523	Yes, the plane will not take off without the list of passengers and their IDs.

This is more about your child's safety than his convince.|`|96d31f2eb78b0da781f956843c10646baa	If you are not married to the father of your son, I understand that as the law presently stands, the father has a responsibility to maintain your son financially - he has no right to see your son if you do not wish him to do so.    To establish such a right, the father will need to seek a appropriate contact order at the Family Law Court.  He will need to establish that it is in your sons best interest to have contact with his father.  Given the circumstances re: the father highlighted in your question, he may find it difficult to convince the court that contact would be advantageous to your son.    You do not need to do anything until such time as the father seeks legal contact.|`|d4cf52959f97cc6ef63e1ad730f1436caa	You will have to get advice from a solicitor. Has he applied for a contact order yet? That will take time to get, giving you more time to get the supervised access into play. You will have the chance to put your concerns forward, but he will also have the same rights as you if he has parental responsibility, which you should check out also.
61YfPllfaa	a good example is having to hide bad news that is seen to be the fault of your party  in the months running up to an election, because it may cause anger and drag the vote away from your particular political party. that's why labour will end up giving the electorate a load of EU backed concessions just before election time. our political system is a corrupt thief and liar infested nightmare. those parasites will say or do anything to stay in power. they have learned to read the voter and manipulate them, via the media, as they please.|`|ShWjnOrBaa	when the voters are angry they get volatile|`|GI27dKIkaa	Voter volatility is a section of the eligible voters who - to put it simply - change their minds every time they vote.    Most people stay loyal to one cause or another - but there is a small section of the electorate who switch allegiance according to their current state of mind, or peer pressure etc.

RD5sTZaFaa	If you completed a deferred adjudication for a misdemeanor offense you are entitled to have the court order that the case not be disclosed to anyone.<br>  <br>  It is a separate petition to be filed in the court where the probation was ordered.  There are about $200.00 in court costs, and a good attorney will charge you about $500.00 to file it for you.  Most likely you will never have to appear in court to get it ordered.<br>  <br>  Once ordered the record of this arrest will be removed from most records, including public data.com, as well as any other cites that purchase the county records and post them on the web.<br>  <br>  If you apply for a government job the employer will be able to access the record of the arrest, but it will show that the charge was dismissed.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

Also the victims will have many problems for years to come.|`|QvNBEDA2aa	Wow. Good question. May be a little harsh. Life in prison, getting the same sentence they dished out to the ones they raped and molested, maybe.

I am also not happy about supporting these folks in prisons with education, recreation, food, medical, etc. I think the sexual crimes; be it repeated rapes which confirms the person has not and can not be rehabilitated, or sexual crimes against a child should be chemically castrated or have a hysterectomy. No exceptions. And should be placed in hard labor camps out in the desert where land is cheap. No frills. If they live, they live. If they die, they die. Good riddens.|`|Zf5gSpKnaa	I am pro death penalty...   But extending that to rape and child molesters is a stretch.  I would definitely favor castration for those offenders.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Sure, Paul.<br>  <br>  We don't even execute the Gitmo terrorists.<br>  <br>  But as we move to a materialistic, Utilitarian society executions will become common like China.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	Yes, why are we allowing them to live for so long.

While this individual has never served in the military I have several former military that I served with that were gay.  While I suspected some were they always did their job and never compromised themselves, their job, or their character and integrity while serving in the military.  None of them ever put me in a situation or exposed their sexuality and behavior to me either forcing me to make a choice in what I should do.  I think the "Don't ask-don't tell" policy is the best policy at this time.  To much of society is against them and the military is just a microcosm of that society in a lot of ways.  Given the mission of the military, the need for discipline and rank structure and the close work and living conditions that some have to live under I think it is the best thing for everyone at this time.|`|MI9zXGEOaa	Yes, "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" (the military policy that discriminates against gay people) is indeed outdated.<br>  <br>  Bill Clinton was against the policy, but was prevented from removing it by Republican congressmen.

After 9/11 when the airline industry went into a slump Bush used the military budget to support Boeing and other aerospace companies. Obama doesn't need to bail out the military, it's already being bailed out.<br>  <br>  2) The US military budget is being poorly spent. It is being spent on the military industrial complex with big ticket items being favored. Most of these big ticket items are irrelevant to Iraq and Afghanistan. You can slash the military budget in half and still send in more troops. All that you need to do is to stop spending money on million dollar anti ship missiles and Awak and to start spending it on M-16, body armor and hummers.<br>  <br>  Seriously, most of America's military budget goes on items that are not needed in the war on terror. Nuclear submarines are useless when your enemies don't have navies, and live in the desert. Who needs stealth bombers when the Taliban don't have radar? And what is the point of having enough nuclear missiles to destroy the world 5 times over?<br>  <br>  What Obama needs to do is to stop wasting money on big ticket items and to start spending it on armored hummers and body armor. It's all well and good sending 17000 more troops in, but if they are all killed by IEDs while you waste money on stealth bombers, what's the point of it?|`|1eb29e16166794203a3fa52b5c9b51b8aa	Obama’s 3 Big Lies <br>  His Plan to Destroy the GOP <br>  <br>  <br>  Dear fellow American: <br>  <br>  Let me tell you the real reason Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid pushed through the biggest spending bill in history – without proper debate, without Republican input, and without any public scrutiny at all. <br>  <br>  Simply, they are trying to turn the United States into a one-party country and to put the Republican Party out of business once and for all. <br>  <br>  The massive appropriation called a stimulus – some $787 billion of your money – is really a political war chest for the Democrats. <br>  <br>  They want to change the face of American politics forever, and they want to use your taxpayer money to do it. <br>  <br>  They want to use billions from our treasury to reward their political friends – and have huge amounts of cash to dole out before the 2010 and 2012 elections. <br>  <br>  Some people have wondered why, if the country is in dire need of emergency “stimulus,” most of the money appropriated by this law will not even be spent this year. <br>  <br>  Instead, spending will go on for five to 10 years. <br>  <br>  There is no mystery here, as the answer is simple: These billions in taxpayer funds will fund the Democratic political machine for many years to come.|`|cVEHvqxEaa	Because it doesn't belong in the bill.

About time she paid for her own d__n frocks.|`|AA11209233	If she feels like her state has plenty of money to fund it's infrastructure needs (which it should--their government gets so much money from oil companies that residents don't pay state income tax, they get money for living there), this is great--Obama said he'd hold mayors to task for wasting the money, and not taking any is a guaranteed way to be sure you don't waste any.  Now, if Alaska needs the stimulus money for their infrastructure needs, it is totally silly to do something like that just for political points, but I don't think that is what is happening here.  Considering Alaska's reputation for dipping into the pork barrel, it is good to hear that they have taken enough federal funds over the past twenty years (thanks to their congressman, not their governors) and won't be wasting any more money that other states need more and could be using.  <br>  <br>  A lot of the Alaskans could be upset over nothing as well.  Palin can't stop the banking and many other parts of the stimulus from affecting her state.  So if Alaskans are worried that they won't get their stimulus checks, mortgage reform, homebuyer credits, etc., she doesn't have the power to stop any of that anyway.  Even if she's playing up the rejection of the money a bit for the press, it's a good move all around.

Personally, I favor a combination of minimum members based not only on population, but also on acreage.  Those who live in minimally populated areas such as Montana and Wyoming deserve representation as much as those who hunker in NYC or LA.  I'd say, a a minimum size should be fixed, along with a population level, and a non-partisan source assigned to evaluate populace shifts no more often than every ten years.

tvNkizDraa	It's a burden in the sense that it is a cost that the employer must pay, even when the employees pay part of the cost, the employer is still footing at least part of the bill.  Under our current system, company rates (larger pool) are much less expensive than an individual getting insurance for themselves.<br>  <br>  The issue that really angers me is when a company does not provide health insurance for employees or makes the rates so high that the employees cannot afford to buy it.  In these instances of 'corporate welfare', the company is basically foisting their responsibility onto the community taxpayers.  For example:<br>  ***  WAL-MART Costs Taxpayers $1,557,000,000 to Support its Employees...<br>  Wal-mart keeps it's wage cost so low and benefits cost so high that state-funded (taxpayer $s) assistance programs end up footing the bill.  This "principled" corporation does provide information to employees about public assistance programs in their local areas.   Watch the documentary, "Wal-mart: The High Cost of Low Price", this link cites stats and sources: <br>  <a href="http://www.walmartmovie.com/facts.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmartmovie.com/facts.php</a>|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Employers pay a portion usually and in some cases, the entire premium for the insurance.<br>  <br>  Of course employers would be relieved to not have to pay this, however, the opposite, someone else paying for it, would either A - government provided = poor health care and limited service with long waiting lists sometimes for basic visits, not ot mention more serious needs. Or B - The burden would be passed on to the individuals, not at a group rate, and more expensive - thus causing a need for employers to have to pay higher salary to people, which may exceed the amount of the premium at a group rate.<br>  <br>  Insurance has gotten so expensive because Doctors charge more, doctors charge more because they have to insure themselves against malpractice, which is caused by either neglect or actual malpractice, or that people have gone crazy over suing doctors for every and anything.<br>  <br>  Once again, another problem in this world boils down to mankind themselves - usually in some matter, involving greed.

If it insurance were nationalized then the lose one more item to manipulate but a new fixed cost to work into pricing.  <br>  <br>  This is one of the loudest anti union points I've heard lately.  The benefit gains of the past have been under constant assault because of these costs.  If we had this nationalized would that help put the big 3 back into the global competitive market?|`|84928ac1d63b4b6f5acf3070843fb849aa	Some pretty good answers here.

I heard this tax was going to be in Oregon, where people are driving hybrid vehicles and are not using as much gas, so the state is loosing revenue, which is a bunch of hogwash. I don't want the govt in my business, telling me what to drive, what to eat, when I can run my heater, and the list is endless. By the way I do not for the most part capitalize government, because they have to earn my respect before they get a capital G.<br>  What really makes me mad is no matter how much American citizens protest, the lawmakers in Washington do not seem to care. Proves to me that power corrupts. I say in the next election, we vote all these morons out and get new ones in. I write my congress men, all the time I know how they vote, and I tell them I will not vote for them again if they continue to ignore the American people.<br>  It is none of the govt business what I drive, where I drive.

Like the 'miles driven' tax that's floating around now. Even IF it was a plausible idea, how in hxll are they going to collect it? Oh, yes, yet another govt bureau (hey, more jobs for 0bots!) another stack of forms for citizens to fill out every year, the cost of collecting all this information and govt employees to track, collect and count all this extra revenue will be more than they collect, again. <br>  But, now here comes the unintended consequences (and there are NO laws or edicts by the govt that DON'T have such) - people get tired of being taxed on their driven miles, so they drive the absolute minimum. No more long vacations (nobody can afford one under 0 anyhow). No more 'wasted trips', we can only afford to go to work and get groceries (assuming there still available). Much less driving, like when gas was $4.50. So, guess what? Less gas consumed, less federal tax collected on gas, less miles driven taxes collected, less buying of everything, less taxes collected on all that stuff we don't buy anymore, less revenues collected overall. Now the stupid bureaucrats have even less money to burn, so 0 declares we're in even worse dire straits that before, and rushes thru yet another stimulus bill.

They make a gas tax on the gallons you use at the pump to pay for road constructions and such, but think about the electric car... It doesn't use gas.  So, to make it fair for the people who drive gas guzzling cars, they are proposing a "user fee" at the pumps.  Your car will be equipped with a GPS montior and when you go to the pump to buy gas you'll be taxes on how many miles you drove.  For the bigger gas guzzling vehicles, they'll still have to pay, but they'll pay less per gallon.  The hybrid cars will have to pay more per gallon since they get more miles per gallon.  They are also proposing people pay the "user fee" when they get their cars registered so that way they can still get the tax off the electric vehicle.|`|7rKUmK0qaa	what do u expect? This is America.

RfxyVIh4aa	You can absolutely have a friend or relative call to do an employment reference check.  Make certain that your friend is someone who would make a good (credible) witness if this matter goes to court.<br>  <br>  Before the conversation is recorded you need to make sure that the law of your state allow it.  Many states allow one party to a conversation to record it without the knowledge of the other party.  MY state requires that both parties consent to the recording.  It is irrelevant that you are trying to create evidence for a potential lawsuit.  You are not allowed to violate the law and could end up getting arrested - and if it is illegally obtained your evidence almost certainly would not be admissible anyway.<br>  <br>  Recording the conversation isn't the only way to create evidence.  Whoever you get to do this should do up a written memo or declaration that describes the conversation immediately after the conversation ends. Written records are important pieces of evidence.<br>  <br>  If you get confirmation that your past employer is doing this, make an appointment for consultation with an employment lawyer.|`|vMthRkrsaa	You have the right idea.  Have the friend call and request a written reference faxed somewhere you can get it. <br>  <br>   Or have the friend call and say this conversation may be recorded for quality control reasons due to company policy.  If they refuse to give the reference, that tells you something right there.<br>  <br>  However, the government seems to get phone conversations admissible in court, I can't see why you couldn't.|`|AA12289202	Your on the right track. You are someone call and pretend to be some one who is interested in you.  Tape the conversation.  but may not be allowed to use in court.  So have you and someone else listen on the phone so you can have a wittiness or witnesses to the illegal act.  The best you can usually get out of this is getting the other person on the other line fired.  But if you get a great lawyer, you can make some money off this illegal action.|`|AA11071040	From my understanding, only Yes or No questions can be asked.  You should have a friend call and see what they say about you.  You can tape it but can't use it in court unless they know they are being recorded.  But once you know what they are saying, you can call them on it and they would have to stop.  Couldn't you use a different employer or if you were not there very long, not use them at all?|`|vhuqAqNdaa	hmm, it would be a difficult one, because he is intitled to his own opinion, and would be difficult to bring legal proceedings against them unless they stated specific facts that were untrue such as absenteeism and time keeping, which you would have counter proof of, then you could do him for slander.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	i would.  try something like 'hello this is biff speedermonk at ibm.  i'm calling you today in regards to a reference of a previous employee, calvin hobbs. i need to verify employment and anything else you care to share.'<br>  as for recording it, check w/ your local laws.  most cases suggest that as long as 1 person in the conversation is aware if the recording, it is legal, but make sure first. if not, you can call them later and tell them you have the tape to try to make them stop, but i doubt this will be effective if they're already breaking the law.<br>  an employer is only legally, in most cases, able to verify that you did work there and the dates if they have nothing positive to say.|`|LzPhdri5aa	Regarding recording, that depends on the state.  As a lawyer or at least do an internet search.<br>  <br>  Regarding having a friend call them, I can think of nowwhere where that would be illegal.  You might also consider going to craigslist and putting something up on the actor section and having an actor do it instead.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Instead of getting your potential employer to call for a reference check, why don't you get letters of reference from your references? I know that as a recruiter, I prefer this method anyways, because I don't need to take the time to try to reach someone's references, especially if I can't reach them the first time. Another thing that you could do if you never got a job is to call the recruiter for the position that you were applying for and get feedback. If S/he says that it was because of your reference check, confront your references.|`|RsJvrCj3aa	Just do a prank call.  Call and say "this is Bob from Staples, I'm calling for a reference on Tom".... or have a friend do it if your voice is too recognizable.  If they are lying, call them out right then and there over the phone... you are not allowed to record the call without their verbal consent though.  they could counter-sue.  you can also ask your prospective employers that have rejected you to explain why you did not get the job.  they do have an obligation to tell you.|`|PBrDYFNwaa	Job seeking<br>  Law number one; never use a reference you are not sure of.<br>  Law number two; never use a reference written in a flat or neutral tone.<br>  <br>  If you have worries about using a reference then you already know there is good reason not to use it.

8a8a4f9bdc242ac1527541eba8696dfeaa	While I agree that we have Socialist programs provided by our tax dollars. I don't agree with having all of them.  The Constitution will only allow the government to perform certain functions and nothing more.   It is a fact that most of the programs are inefficient, in particular the Department of Education, it is a horrible system, I would even call it a failure.  Look at the lack of education of the average American citizen.  I ask you,  what historical documents have you read that explains the reasoning of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights?  Most likely none, and neither have most of the posters on this site.  Most likely most of Americans which is why we are in this terrible mess in the first place.  We are a self-governed people, and we run are supposed to be running the show, not the other way around.  I see a lot of opinions here not based on facts but on emotions.  If you are willing to have a master and be a slave then you have clearly never read history.

Either way, you are dumb.|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	Their is a difference between services that society has decided to provide for consumers and socialism.  Take 911, or the police department, or fire departments, we all contribute to their upkeep in the hope that when we need that service it is available to us, not just someone else.  Therefore, even though it is not voluntary, we accept it because it is a level of protection for all of us as citizens of a community.  Socialism runs much deeper than that.  First, motivation and inclination to use the service.  How many additional people will abuse the 911 system or fire protection because it is available?  Having fire protection doesn't mean you lose the ability or will to protect your own property from fire.  The same can not be said about socialistic programs that will create a class of people that are not capable of competing any longer.  <br>  <br>  Here's the problem: Liberals want a system where no one ever falls through the cracks but, they never are able to count the true cost, since they will not agree that these programs fundamentally change the motivations of many people.  It is true that the government can do a great deal of help in a particular situation with defined goals and limited scope.  However, when applied nationwide, the system will generally choke the life out of itself and then the original people paying for the system will then be required to increase their giving to overcome the mismangement and abuse.|`|AA10779599	The difference in Christianity & socialism as it relates to actions between Humans - Christianity may attempt to shame the individual into helping out his brother while the government uses extortion to force help towards even people that are just to lazy to help themselves.  Christianity will also shame the individual into helping themselves when they see it is a con.  The Christians (using their own money) are also more generous to the poor than the Left.  Even in the Bible man was expected to Work.  Also in the early days of this nation the religious leaders discovered that more wealth was created with private enterprise.<br>  <br>  Remember the Left is anti Christianity except when it suit their arguments!|`|UdERC367aa	Yes - it is true that America was socialized at one time  but not  espousing the principles of today's socialism.<br>  <br>  The  spread of populist farm groups with cooperative practices during the 1870s–1890s was larger, the moments of black-and-white unity in rural and urban movements from the 1890s to 1910s were more dramatic, and strikes and socialist electoral campaigns quite prevalent.<br>  <br>  The progressive movement of the 1900's is testament toward a socialized population.|`|f02313bbf6326c5b58f30cd80bc1329eaa	You are silly, you silly silly goose!<br>  <br>  Here is the lowdown because apparently you just don't get it.<br>  1- 911. This is a necessary service. This provides for the safety and services we have to have as a society. If your neighbors house catches fire, and no one comes to put it out, your house will catch fire too, and the chain continues and a lot of people lose their homes.<br>   Likewise, without 911, criminals could break into our home and take your stuff, and you would be a) out of your possessions, b) dead because they killed you to take your things, or c) crying because they raped, or killed your loved ones.<br>  <br>  2- Not sure where you came up with this little nugget of information. <br>  <br>  3- Open your eyes and ears. Americans are not happy to be bailing out all these irresponsible home owners. But that is a new subject. lets go back and see how often welfare reform comes up because the working people of America are sick and tired of working to support their own families as well as the lazy assed families who won't work for themselves. Many Americans don't want to keep paying out on welfare checks to people who have no job and keep having kids.<br>  <br>  4- Emergency room is socialist, and look at how rocking the health care industry is! See all these illegals who have no insurance just go to the ER. The government is not getting those bills. The hospitals pass those costs onto other people. That drives up the cost of insurance. So once again, we the hard working American people are paying because some bonehead can't do the right thing.<br>  <br>  America was not socialist in the beggining. The constitution grants says God gave us the right to pursue happiness. Socialism is God saying the country has to make us happy.<br>  <br>  PS your edit proves the point. <br>  <br>  It says one nation under God, not one nation under a christian God.<br>  <br>  It says In God We Trust, not IN a Christian God We trust.|`|gYkpyCb0aa	So your question is...?<br>  <br>  We're well aware that all sorts of socialist policies existed in the United States before Obama. I disagree that they are good, and that's why I don't like Obama's dramatic expansion of these policies. <br>  <br>  Christianity supports charity, which is the opposite of socialism. When you act charitably, you give of your own to someone in need. In socialism, you take from your neighbors forcibly to help someone in need. The bible never told anyone to do anything like that.<br>  <br>  Your Edit: Rememeber this "Its easier for a camel to fit through the needle of another eye than it is for rich man to go to heaven." yeah that's form the bible.<br>  <br>  Sure, the bible doesn't have anything good to say about being rich. That doesn't give any justification for stealing the riches of others for the purposes of redistribution. Show me the verse that says "Thou shalt take money from the rich to give to the poor" and you'll have proved your point. <br>  <br>  Hint: No such verse exists.<br>  <br>  Edit: Bravo! You gave a reference for a verse saying it's hard for rich people to get into heaven. Once again: do you have a verse saying it's good to take money from rich people to give it to poor people?|`|ypUsp2Ldaa	I think you need to change your definition of socialism. Socialism is government control over means of production and distribution of goods. It has nothing to do with charity or christianity. There are christian socialists but the bible does not advocate socialism in anyway. It advocates helping people. Personal charity and redistribution of wealth are two very very different things. I would also like to say that no socialist ideology or position supports #s 1 or 4. These are just common sense procedures advocated by almost everyone of any political leaning. <br>  Oh by the way, there were christian nazis, christian communists, christian anarchists, christian conservatives, christian liberals, christian moderates and christian just about anything else you can think of. That's what happens when over 30% of the world follows one religion.

We could have many children starving to death in America if we give to much to people that do not produce. No capitalism supports our economy and the wealth of our nation. Without capitalism we would not have been able to defeat Hitler. Our economic powerhouse was a major factor in Hitlers defeat. It is foolish to give money needed for an economy to people who just exist and do not produce for the country. 42% of our national spending is medicare and social security. Did you know Social Security was at first was voluntary and was said it would never be mandatory. Once people rely on the government for checks. They will vote for themselves raises and take money away from those who would use it properly. the rich are not rich by chance. Most of those become poor again. They are rich because of knowledge and hard work which should be supported by our government. The problem with socialism is not that it is there. It is that it is constantly growing and hopw many socialist programs have given people wealth so they could stand on their own so they would not have to grow government to get wages. <br>  <br>    There is one word that explains why government should stay outside business and just make sure it does not hurt the people. Blagoavich. Do you want "him" bailing out certain comapnies and letting the companies that do not pay for play (the more respectable ones) go down.

FdQD8H3qaa	This country is run by fear and scare tactics!  Republicans hate the idea of universal health care for two main reasons.  First they think that you are only worth as much as you make so if you make more money then you should be helped first because you are more important because of having money where in fact the person that needs the care the most should be helped first.. It is crazy that you are asked what kind of insurance you have and how you will be paying for your treatment before the doctor even looks at you!  and the second reason that Republicans hate the idea of universal health care is because most of the Republicans that have power are all from "old money".  The reason that health care costs as much as it does isn't really about the "costs" but because of the mark up from all of the insurance companies and the drug industry.  The Republicans don't want any of their money that is gushing in from these industries to dry up so they would rather have people be sick and die then to lose out on a single penny that they think is theirs!!!   The saddest thing about the USA is that people are always talking about how they would lose freedoms from socialized programs when really they have no freedom!  In most countries the government fears the people in the sense that if the people are unhappy then they will protest and demand changes but in the USA it is completely the other way..  The government controls the people!!!!  Stand up and take a stand and demand change!!!!!!!|`|5COJmUOWaa	Trying to make sense of it is a waste of time.

Frequently Democrats and Republicans blame each other when often they’re both responsible and fiddle while Rome burns.<br>  <br>  The problem is: During the time when the bull grazed the greener pastures abundant at Wall Street, investment firms' rise was exponential, exorbitant bonuses were being dispersed to the chosen few, high profits were being made at every trade and the echelons of investment management and consulting institutions were basking in the glory of capitalism, leaving the middle class as untouchables and to say the least wondering.

The bailout packages rushed to conquer the invading territory with weakened forces.

Communism is the form of government and Socialism is the branch of economy that it is associated with.  Most republicans (judging by the candidates for positions and government and people who I have learned about)  are very much set in their way of "If you don't earn anything then you don't get anything", its understandable but when you think of the amount of poverty the "richest country in the world" has its a bit too much and its not like those poor people can make more money because a lot of poor people are poor because they have families to take care of or they have no outlet for profit (living paycheck to paycheck).  And yes socialized health care also known as universal health care is based on the fact that no one would be turned away to medical help.  I think even with helping the sick or injured people are afraid that hospitals will be more crowded and that hospitals and other various health care establishments will need more money (increasing the national debt) for medical supplies and equipment considering how many more people will be seeking medical help (that actually can get it).  There reason is understandable but we should really try to save lives not save money, the government has extremely perplexing priorities.  I don't think people really give socialism a chance just because America still fears Communism but we are going to have to incorporate some socialism to make this country a better place to live in.  Also people need to understand that if you are born into a poor family you do not have the outlet for a a good college if any college at all which usually leads to a lesser paying job (people have extreme difficulty getting out of poverty, some of it is their problem but we need to understand that most of them just need help).|`|f9crUDTwaa	Some people believe that if we have any socialist type programs ,we will all fall to the Communist demon that has been lurking in wait to capture us since the end of World War 2.
cb9c8be6c633186631612c54c6c11d0aaa	to escape futur judgments from the world for being nazis during the war.<br>   Argentina and Germany had close ties to each other since the immigration of Germans to Argentina. A flourishing trade developed between Germany and Argentina as early as the German Unification, Germany had a privileged position in the Argentine economy. Later on, Argentina maintained a strong economic relationship with both Germany and Great Britain and supported them with supplies during World War I.<br>  <br>  The military connection between Argentina and Prussia has often been emphasized, and there can be no doubt that sympathy for Germany among the general staff in Buenos Aires contributed to establishing Argentina's policy of neutrality during the two world wars. From the point of view of Argentine strategists at the end of the nineteenth century, it was a clever move to fall in line with the strongest European war machine. Great Britain and North America became aware of the threat that Argentina's German-speakers, which was a quarter million strong, acted as the Reich's agent. There was indeed some support for Nazi Germany among Argentines, although others also viewed Hitler's rise to power and militarism with suspicion.<br>  <br>  After World War II, under Juan Perón's government, Argentina participated in establishing and facilitating secret escape routes out of Germany to South America to SS Officials and Nazi criminals (referred as ODESSA network[1] ). <br>  Former Nazi officials emigrated to Argentina in order to prevent their prosecutions for war crimes, some of them lived in Argentina under their real names while others were given false identities. Some of the most known Nazi criminals that emigrated to Argentina are: Adolf Eichmann, Josef Mengele, Aribert Heim and Edward Roschmann among others.|`|eb7939afceea213fb37cb6c2a376ba3faa	They were ex-Nazis on the run at the end of WW2.

QI74CxD0aa	If those in political power lack moral integrity and have motives like greed or malice against someone they do not like, yes they can easily frame someone for a crime.   They could probably frame anyone for a crime.  <br>  Look at history.  During the witch hunts, for example, people were accused because someone else wanted their property or because they did not like their neighbors.  Human nature has not changed, so this is something we will always have to guard against.  Those who just assume that someone accused is guilty help create an environment in which this is possible.  Those who stay quiet when they see others hauled away, as happened under Hitler and Stalin, also help create the environment in which this happens.|`|0Yyl68oDaa	Frame me, doubtful -- for I am very cautious.

Neighbor x is accused of having sex with a 6 yo, images found on computer.<br>  <br>  Regardless of what the lawyers do --- the accused would be ruined for life.   Depending on the time of year (election cycle) police would be reluctant to investigate too closely.   Blame a member of the clergy and the Klegg lights will be there.<br>  <br>  Raid a neighbor's garbage or recycling obtain some basic data,  deposit money in an offshore account in your neighbor's name --- then leak the fund to the IRS and media.

If you haven’t read the Wealth of Nations, I encourage you to do so, it is the cornerstone of the bulk of the republican economic view.   He stated: <br>  <br>  “The Best Result comes from everyone in the group doing what’s best for himself”<br>  <br>  However, the concept of Governing Dynamics introduced in the 1940’s based on the Nash Equilibrium revised that logic<br>  <br>  “The Best Result comes from everyone in the group doing what’s best for himself AND THE GROUP”<br>  <br>  In economics, the differences can be explained this way:<br>  <br>  Think of it as a business structure<br>  <br>  Company A uses Smith economics – Each person reaching their highest potential in the pyramid<br>  <br>  The president gets paid $1,000,000 a year<br>  The VP $500,000<br>  The CFO gets paid $400,000<br>  The CIO gets paid $400,000<br>  The COO gets paid $400,000<br>  The Manager gets paid $100,000<br>  And 5 Workers each make 50,000 a year<br>  Payroll expense of the company:  3.05 million<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Company B Uses Governing Dynamics, with a board of directors – eliminating the possibility of the best position (The President)<br>  The 5 Members of the Board each Make $500,000 a year<br>  The Manager gets paid $150,000<br>  5 Workers each make 60,000 a year<br>  And 2 Part Timers each make 50,000 a year<br>  Payroll expense of the company:  3.05 million<br>   <br>  Now, which company would you like to work for?  You sacrifice the crown for the good of everyone else… Everyone else gets paid more, and you can even employ more people<br>  <br>  Now, that you understand the difference in democrat economics and republican economics, let’s focus on your question, the mortgage bailout <br>  <br>  The Logic behind offering better mortgage terms is to prevent foreclosure.  Preventing foreclosures means you don’t loose more in the long run, it prevents property values from dropping.<br>  <br>  Scenario:<br>  You live in a beautiful subdivision in which most of the houses are identical.  Let’s say each home was purchased originally for about $200,000.   That is the appraised value of the home when you purchased it, that is the tax base value of the property (yes there is normally a difference there, but assume they are not)<br>  <br>  Your Subdivision has 10 homes in it, each paying cheap property taxes at 1%, that results in a tax base of 2,000 per home annually, or 20,000 for the city.<br>  <br>  Now, with the foreclosure crisis, and the economy, you are lucky enough to be the only one in your subdivision that can afford to keep your home, and all your neighbors are foreclosed upon.<br>  <br>  The government is in crisis now because:<br>  1) The property tax revenue just went from 20,000 to 2,000.  That is not good for the city.  <br>  2) Social programs costs just skyrocketed because we now have 9 more homeless families <br>  <br>  Now forget the government, you just care about yourself, so your question is why should you pay?<br>  <br>  Because when your neighbors foreclose 1 of 2 things happens<br>  1. Properties are left abandoned, Your neighborhood looses it’s appeal, the city stops maintaining your roads, parks etc. Your Property value drops as no one wants to live in an ugly neighborhood<br>  2. Houses are sold at auction, Each of your neighbors houses is sold at half it’s value(100,000), Your Property value drops as every house on that block is now assessed at that price.  If you want to sell your home in the next 5 years, good luck trying to get anything more than what your neighbors houses sold for.<br>  <br>  Now  looking at it that way, if this scenario happened and each of your neighbors came to you asking for $1,000 to help them stay out of foreclosure, would you hand out $9,000 to all of your neighbors, or would you take the risk and let the property value drop?<br>  <br>  If you say you would hand out money to your neighbors, you support this economic plan.|`|Ty4miOmKaa	I'm against bailing anyone out for anything at anytime.

The foreclosures are at the heart of our declining property values and are gutting our local property tax base.  As a result, we have less funds locally for our schools and essential (police, fire protection) services.  I don't like any kind of bailout, but if there must be one, I'd rather see it go towards the local community problems than going towards retreats, CEO bonuses and dividends.  <br>  <br>  The first half of that bailout has already been spent and it did not unfreeze the credit market so it did not help to stem the foreclosures.  Basically, the money was funneled to the top and did not 'trickle down' to the root problems.  Here's an interesting article about this bailout culture.<br>  <a href="http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/moral-hazard/2008/09/19/what-moral-hazard?page=0,1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/mora...</a>|`|LZLQKUMPaa	This is called spread the wealth you work hard pay your bills on time and then you take your extra money and give it to the people that overextended and where to build them out is called spread the wealth that's what you voted for the democratic party so everybody is the same so keep working so the welfare can have a paycheck and the people over extended will keep going .this is the new American way that the democrats want .|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Yeah this whole situation is kind of crazy.<br>  I sure as hell didn't get free rent the last 2 years so even if they lost their homes they still did way better than me!<br>  I just don't know what the big deal is.

I sincerely hope that there will be a clause in the new mortgage contract that says....if the house gains enough value to equal what their original mortgage was, (which it eventually will), the person will be required to keep paying until the total mortgage is satisfied.

Perhaps it started with the cultural polarization that took place in the 60's; followed by the corrupt and exploitative activities of the Nixon Administration.  In recent years, the discourse has become even more appalling.  Republicans recoil at the animus and hatred directed at George Bush, and rightly so.  Yet you find few who find the vicious attacks directed at Bill Clinton as objectionable.  Even read the posts that some people have made to this question; the hypocrisy of complaining of Bush hatred and in the same post saying Obama is not a US citizen and should be in jail, is evident.  It's possible for reasonable people to express policy disagreements without personally demeaning those with whom we disagree.  Unfortunately most reasonable people are put off by the disgusting personal vindictiveness of our current politics.|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Yes I have. Go back and review the early days of the Bush administration. Specifically related to the statements regarding the outcome of the election.<br>  <br>  "Does it not insult your intelligence that people say it's just disagreement on policy as if they don't see the things their fellow Republicans say." No more than it insults my intelligence when Democrats act the same way making the same excuses for their own bad behavior.<br>  <br>  "Had we said no to Bush on everything there would never have been an Iraq war so that is a lame comparison." Sounds like something you should take up with representatives. However, dissent over policy is not hatred. You are arguing against self interest now because Democrats have supported their constant attacks on Bush for the last eight years as legitimate dissent against policy. The double standard you are trying to impose is beyond the pale and only demonstrates that you are a partisan twit with a do as I say not as I do attitude.|`|vSRhp7zxaa	No, but I also haven't seen such personal hatred for a President-elect before he even took the oath of office.  <br>  <br>  The hatred has nothing to do with what Obama has done in the last month.

NkEHCHsOaa	In a criminal matter, yes. If it's civil they have to be served with papers.|`|CowgOqXTaa	OK, well, first, if YOU have a pending case against someone, it's a *civil* case, and indictments are handed down only in *criminal* cases, so the question makes no sense as asked.<br>  <br>  If you're asking about civil law; "Can I sue someone who is out of the country" the answer is "maybe". If the person regularly lives outside the US, then it's likely that the correct venue to sue him is where HE is, not where YOU are. Under some circumstances though, suing where you are may be possible. (If, for example, he maintains a business presence in your State)<br>  <br>  If you are asking about criminal law; "Can a court indict a suspected criminal who is out of the country?" then the answer is "Yes". An indictment is necessary before the government can request his extradition from the country where he can be found.<br>  <br>  Richard|`|RD5sTZaFaa	A prosecuting attorney is the one who obtains an indictment, not a court.  If there is a pending court case against someone without an indictment, it may not be a felony.  Once the indictment is obtained by the prosecution it is filed with the papers of the court, which starts the case.<br>  <br>  If a charge is pending, and no indictment has been filed it is not a "court case" yet.  There can be a criminal charge investigated by the police, even an arrest and requirement of paying a bond to be released from jail without ever filing a charge in the court.<br>  <br>  A Grand Jury is convened, and the prosecutor presents the information that they have and if the Grand Jury agrees that the person ought to be brought to court to answer a criminal charge for the behavior then they will return what is called an indictment to the prosecutor.  If they do not feel that this ought to be charged as a crime they return what is called a "no bill".  <br>  <br>  It makes no difference if the person is in the country.  The person may have a right to appear, if they are aware that the case is being presented, however it is a "secret tribunal" and he is not really entitled to be notified if the case is presented unless he has notified the prosecuting attorney of his wish to testify.<br>  <br>  If the charged person appears and testifies he is not entitled to have an attorney present in the chamber with him.  He may be permitted to go to the door and confer with his attorney, who may be allowed to wait outside the room, but cannot have anyone go inside with him.<br>  <br>  The Grand Jury has the right to subpoena witnesses, including the defendant.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the defendant will be permitted to prepare documents to be distributed to the members of the grand jury.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ucYwexwJaa	Yes, people get indicted all the time that aren't in the country.

With the SFC board going on right now, there will be somewhat of a snowball effect as some SSGs will be picked up for promotion, opening up some slots for SGTs, and so on and so forth.<br>  <br>  But you need to keep the faith.  My recommendation to you is to seek positions (leadership and staff, preferably) in the next higher rank(s) and always work above your skill level.  This hard work will pay off for the senior promotion boards.  It took me 5 years to make SSG due to the promotion points (798 constantly).  But because I never stopped working at the next higher rank(s), plus I took the difficult high visibility positions and additional duties that Soldiers avoided, and I made sure it all reflected in my NCOERs, I was picked up for SFC and then MSG on my first look.<br>  <br>  Funny, it took me 5 years to make SSG and in that same time frame I went from SSG to MSG.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	It is always possible but your best bet is to max out your points.

fjidmhxsaa	The Nigerian Advance Fee Scam has been around for quite awhile, but despite many warnings, continues to draw in many victims. In fact, the Financial Crimes Division of the Secret Service receives approximately 100 telephone calls from victims/ potential victims and 300-500 pieces of related correspondence per day about this scam!<br>  <br>  Indications are that the advance fee fraud grosses hundreds of millions of dollars annually and the losses are continuing to escalate.<br>  <br>  The Nigerian Advance Fee Scheme (also known internationally as "4-1-9" fraud after the section of the Nigerian penal code which addresses fraud schemes) is generally targeted at small and medium sized businesses, as well as charities. This global scam (recently seen in Russia, Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as the US) involves the receipt of an unsolicited letter purporting to come from someone who claims to work for the Nigerian Central Bank or from the Nigerian government. (The Central Bank of Nigeria denies all connection to those who promote this scheme.)<br>  <br>  In the letter, a Nigerian claiming to be a senior civil servant will inform the recipient that he is seeking a reputable foreign company into whose account he can deposit funds ranging from $10-$60 million which the Nigerian government overpaid on some procurement contract.<br>  <br>  The goal of the scam artist is to delude the victim into thinking that he or she has been singled out to participate in a very lucrative -- although questionable -- arrangement. The intended victim is reassured of the authenticity of the arrangement by forged or false documents bearing apparently official Nigerian government letterhead, seals, as well as false letters of credit, payment schedules and bank drafts. The scam artist may even establish the credibility of his contacts, and thereby his influence, by arranging a meeting between the victim and "government officials" in real or fake government offices.<br>  <br>  Once the victim becomes confident of the potential success of the deal, something goes wrong. The victim is then pressured or threatened to provide one or more large sums of money to save the venture. For example, an official will demand an up-front bribe or an unforeseen tax or fee to the Nigerian government will have to be paid before the money can be transferred. Each fee paid is described as the very last fee required. The scheme may be stretched out over many months.<br>  <br>  Here is a sample of a letter a victim may receive:<br>  <br>  (Note: The letter that is sent is all in capital letters.)<br>  <br>  LAGOS, NIGERIA.<br>  <br>  ATTENTION: THE PRESIDENT/CEO<br>  <br>  DEAR SIR,<br>  <br>  CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL<br>  <br>  HAVING CONSULTED WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND BASED ON THE INFORMATION GATHERED FROM THE NIGERIAN CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO REQUEST FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE TO TRANSFER THE SUM OF $47,500,000.00 (FORTY SEVEN MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) INTO YOUR ACCOUNTS. THE ABOVE SUM RESULTED FROM AN OVER-INVOICED CONTRACT, EXECUTED COMMISSIONED AND PAID FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS (5) AGO BY A FOREIGN CONTRACTOR. THIS ACTION WAS HOWEVER INTENTIONAL AND SINCE THEN THE FUND HAS BEEN IN A SUSPENSE ACCOUNT AT THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA APEX BANK.<br>  <br>  WE ARE NOW READY TO TRANSFER THE FUND OVERSEAS AND THAT IS WHERE YOU COME IN. IT IS IMPORTANT TO INFORM YOU THAT AS CIVIL SERVANTS, WE ARE FORBIDDEN TO OPERATE A FOREIGN ACCOUNT; THAT IS WHY WE REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE. THE TOTAL SUM WILL BE SHARED AS FOLLOWS: 70% FOR US, 25% FOR YOU AND 5% FOR LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL EXPENSES INCIDENT TO THE TRANSFER.<br>  <br>  THE TRANSFER IS RISK FREE ON BOTH SIDES. I AM AN ACCOUNTANT WITH THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC). IF YOU FIND THIS PROPOSAL ACCEPTABLE, WE SHALL REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTS:<br>  <br>  (A) YOUR BANKER'S NAME, TELEPHONE, ACCOUNT AND FAX NUMBERS.<br>  <br>  (B) YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS -- FOR CONFIDENTIALITY AND EASY COMMUNICATION.<br>  <br>  (C) YOUR LETTER-HEADED PAPER STAMPED AND SIGNED.<br>  <br>  ALTERNATIVELY WE WILL FURNISH YOU WITH THE TEXT OF WHAT TO TYPE INTO YOUR LETTER-HEADED PAPER, ALONG WITH A BREAKDOWN EXPLAINING, COMPREHENSIVELY WHAT WE REQUIRE OF YOU. THE BUSINESS WILL TAKE US THIRTY (30) WORKING DAYS TO ACCOMPLISH.<br>  <br>  PLEASE REPLY URGENTLY.<br>  <br>  BEST REGARDS<br>  <br>  Be careful. This scam can be physically dangerous as well as dangerous to your finances. Victims are almost always requested to travel to Nigeria or a border country to complete a transaction. Victims are often told that a visa will not be necessary to enter the country. The Nigerian scam artists may then bribe airport officials to pass the victims through Immigration and Customs. Because it is a serious offense in Nigeria to enter without a valid visa, the victim's illegal entry may be used by the scam artists as leverage to coerce the victims into releasing funds. Violence and threats of physical harm may be employed to further pressure victims. In June of 1995, an American was murdered in Lagos, Nigeria, wh|`|788d7c7ce9ee2dd89f47d95303ca9817aa	They e-mail, call, and fax proficient people in developed countries.

The above sum resulted from an over-invoiced contract, executed, commissioned and paid for about five years (5) ago by a foreign contractor. This action was however intentional and since then the fund has been in a suspense account at The Central Bank Of Nigeria Apex Bank."<br>  <br>  yadda, yadda, yadda. <br>  <br>  Basically they convince greedy people to wire them large amounts of money. These people are called 419, and this is their job. Nigeria is very rich in oil, it really isn't a poor country. <br>  <br>  Nigerians keep scamming because it is easy money. They don't get caught because it's hard to track them, and its hard to sue internationally. <br>  <br>  They fool millionaires easily, and they research and get big name e-mails.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	The majority of the Nigeria scams are someone will claim they have come into a very large sum of money and need your help to get that money out of the country and they will pay you a hefty sum to assist them (usually a sum in the millions). So what they will do is tell you that you will need to pay some fees up front in order to get paperowrk and other things done before they can give you back your money. You give them the money and you either never hear from them again, OR they try to get even more money out of you. <br>  <br>  They keep scamming because people still fall for it. <br>  <br>  Now they have the "international lottery" scams, is the same basic scam, you have won a bunch of mney but you will need to pay a fee in order to collect the large sum.|`|46eoAIGZaa	Well this is a ridiculous scam that feeds off people with too much trust.  It typically starts with either a letter in the mail or an e-mail.  Stating this gentleman needs some one to help him get some money out of a bank and that if you pay him some money, he will reward you with hundreds if not thousands of dollars in return for you help.  It's called the Nigeria scam because typically that is where this person is claiming to be.  It also goes other ways where the person says your the only surviving relative and that they need you help getting into the country.  If you help them get into the country (by means of paying for them- usually with a transfer of funds or flat cash) they will repay you ten-folds when they arrive.  People that fall for this scam never see the money and usually have no way of tracking these people because they cover their tracks.  I've heard there is a government agency that is looking into the matter and trying to track them down and press federal charges against them.  Whether that is true or not couldn't tell you.  Don't fall for the scam, don't give out money, don't divulge any info about yourself to these people.  Delete the e-mail or throw the letter away.|`|QPB6e3lVaa	I got my first Nigerian scam in 1996 (13 years ago) and still receive them. They ask you for information that will allow them to access your bank account, then they remove all of your money. They are very polite, saying for example that someone has died and there is a $50 million dollar savings account that needs to be moved and they need only to have a US bank account to move it into, then back out. You can keep $5 million for your trouble, just please send your account information right away. These people do just that for a living, people fall for it, thinking that they will get rich, but they lose everything. The Nigerian government does not care: foolish Americans are not their problem. The scammers purchase email lists which are available everywhere.

ebu9fXahaa	It reminds me of fire and the smell of brimstone while carrying a handbag by Gucci or Prada...so much of what use to be respected public figures...which there has been a lot of years I have had any respect for a lot of public servants, but to put it bluntly, the country is going to hell in a handbasket.  <br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  It was election time and the politician decided to go out to the local reservation and try to get the Native American vote. They were all assembled in the Council Hall to hear the speech. The politician had worked up to his finale, and the crowd was getting more and more excited. "I promise better education opportunities for Native Americans!"<br>  <br>  The crowd went wild, shouting "Hoya Hoya".<br>  <br>  The politician was a bit puzzled by the native word, but was encouraged by their enthusiasm. "I promise gambling reforms to allow a Casino on the Reservation!"<br>  <br>  "Hoya! Hoya!" cried the crowd, stomping their feet.<br>  <br>  "I promise more social reforms and job opportunities for Native Americans!"<br>  <br>  The crowd reached a frenzied pitch shouting "Hoya! Hoya! Hoya!"<br>  <br>  After the speech, the Politician was touring the Reservation, and saw a tremendous herd of cattle. Since he was raised on a ranch, and knew a bit about cattle, he asked the Chief if he could get closer to take a look at the cattle.<br>  <br>  "Sure," the Chief said, "but be careful not to step in the hoya."|`|pAAkNAQvaa	it's the dead canary in the mine.

TT0rCi8kaa	When India gained independence, they inherited a fully working infrastructure, from the British, which, with a few cultural changes, remains pretty much as it was in Colonial times. Pakistan was also left the workings of a central Govt, and justice system, but the first Pakistan Government was made up of Imams, with no experience of how to govern, also with an axe to grind against the west, and they chose to dismantle the infrastructure, and replace it with their own particular fundamentalist system of laws. Which didn't work particularly well, and turned out to be a breeding ground for anti western fundamentalists. Which hasn't done them any favours in the international sense. India has generally been quite outward looking, in it's foreign policy, and open to western education, and trade, and now has a good relationship with most other countries.<br>  Also, it never turns out well, when a Country chooses to run it's Government along religious rules.

Liberals are willing to risk challenging a "Status Quo".<br>  <br>  "Civil Rights" is a classic example.  Democrats turned Republicans maintain the conservative perspective on what rights citizens should and should not have.  Senators Lott, Thurmond, Grahm, and other DixieCrats changed parties to avoid identification with the changing  social tides.<br>  <br>  Now that the laws once opposed by conservative are in effect the masters of conservatism maintain the gate to restrain further changes.  If one is not careful conservatives will claim authority and authorship of "Civil Rights".<br>  <br>  During the '50s and '60s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was identified as a communist, outside agitator, and troublemaker.  Currently, many of the staunch critics who survive respectfully acknowledge the benefit of Dr. King and "The Movement".|`|B9tHjHqLaa	because they feel the need to help everyone with a minor inconvenience in their life eventually causing economic collapse...there are some liberals who are good at running things but historically most almost completely destroyed whatever they touched.....no offense to anyone just do your own research|`|HykE5X0Laa	Don't flatter yourself and don't make a general statement like that.|`|b538976641cc2a50041772f307796f66aa	Yeah and they think California is a suprise.|`|zXY8UGKWaa	because liberals rush in to help in those abandoned conservative failure areas.

nDvrN6Qgaa	Racist is a convenient handle and has been used as a weapon against any criticism of black action.  Whites are so afraid of being labeled a racist they cave in at just the utterance of the word.  And it's not only the blacks in America.  It's now every minority group on the books.  If you disagree with anything any of them do you are a racist.  Is this right?  Nope, but that's just how it is.  The new definition of racist is a white person.  A member of a minority cannot be a racist according to the tenants of political correctness.

The cartoonist is entitled to their opinion, and have all the protections that the 1st Amendment of the Constitution gives people.<br>  This the way it almost always goes, it is alright to show pictures of Former President Bush with a monkey making facial expressions, and there is nothing wrong with it, substitute the picture with either Roland Burris or Barack Obama, and all of a sudden it is racist.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	It's not racist.

What is considered 'fair' for one section of the community could well be seen as unfair to others. eg Gay and lesbian adoption. It may be fair to them but is it fair to the children involved?  and is it fair to the middle class childless couples who wish to adopt. I''m all for genuine fairness fairness but it should be tempered by a Ministry of Common Sense or other such body.<br>  Sorry Smiley your notions just don't fit my mindset.
EBng6XBhaa	Because it is an acknowledged cultural problem which is being addressed, not official government policy.<br>  <br>  It is also a class based system rather than one based on race.

ucYwexwJaa	I worked for a guy once who only hired hot chicks, it was a video store in a medium sized town and I got the job before the guy bought the store.  Since I knew how to work everything he kept me on staff.  This was when I was around 18, and I'd be tapping all of my co-workers.  It was the greatest job anyone could wish for.  Anyways, to answer your question, yes he kept it under 15 employees, anything more than that and he'd have to start hiring blacks, mexicans, people with handicaps, and pregger peoples.  I was thankful he kept it a small workforce, it makes for a better environment.|`|0DOZKXwRaa	Sounds like they fired you for being pregnant. Sucks, but there isn't much you can do. Try to file a report at the labour board... <br>  <br>  The reason is that it is much more difficult for a small company to keep a job available for a year for a pregnant person, than it is for a large company. Also, there are less jobs, and not always possble to re-assign staff to safe tasks while pregnant.

FsBUKc1vaa	Jump pay is 150 dollars more a month<br>  <br>  DEF. go with the 82nd!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  You wont be closer to any action, that depends on what unit you are in and your job. We havent had any real combat jobs in a long time|`|G6yyceAxaa	Oh yea of little knowledge:<br>  <br>  first of all, once you sign your contract, that is what you get. so you can't decide in basic that you want to be airborne, and they say, oh sure no problem (not)<br>  <br>  the 101st is not an airborne unit, it is air assault. they have not been airborne since the 60's.<br>  <br>  As a intel analyst, unless you have in your contract that you are going to Fort Bragg, even if you went airborne, you can end up anywhere (more than likely your first tour will be Korea)<br>  <br>  if you are airborne, and on jump status, you do receive monthly jump pay (I think it is about 120.00 a month)<br>  <br>  the only action you will see as an Intel analyst is the stack of pictures falling off the desk, or maybe somebodies computer crashing.|`|EBw32eQYaa	If you do airborne, you may get attached to a special forces brigade and would do intel for them. Also you could possibly be able to go on aerial recon missions. Pay would be higher of course. I would definitely go for it. Especially if when you get to AIT you get orders to a crappy place, you can opt out for airborne.|`|G08kFU3Taa	Well first off, anytime you have an opportunity to go to a school or something...take it. Its always beneficial to your career. 82nd is an airborne unit, 101st is an air assault unit, they are airborne by history but they don't jump anymore if I'm not mistaken. <br>  <br>  you will get extra pay if you are on jump status with an airborne unit and if you are meeting your jump quotas, but going to airborne school and just being in a regular unit just means you wear your jump wings and you went to the school. <br>  <br>  being an Intel analyst, consider yourself lucky if you get to be "close to the action" airborne or not, when and if you go to combat the likeliness of you doing a combat jump are slim to none...closer to the none. <br>  <br>  ...you shoulda went Infantry if that's what you wanted. but being a grunt is not for everyone. <br>  <br>  ...but thanks for supporting us.|`|XOPvmV5Iaa	Although I was in the USAF, I'd say get every bit of training you possibly can.

7QtY1cSmaa	Did you see a flash?

They have mobile cameras everywhere, and the tolerance is minimal. I went past a multanova doing 6km over 60kmh the limit (about 3.5mph) and got a $50 fine and a penalty point.

It is a crime to disseminate information abut an arrest that has been expunged from a person's record.  <br>  <br>  Expunging means that all the agencies that have records regarding that arrest have been ordered to destroy that record.  It includes the FBI, and local law enforcement agencies.<br>  <br>  It usually means that the charge was dismissed, or that you were acquitted by a jury at trial, so congratulations.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

That was an attempt to "shut you up" with money.  Money is not the issue here, neither should you make it into one by pursuing a judgment for compensation.  Basically, you don't deserve compensation since you were not out any money because of the treatment you received. What you should want, however, is for the racist employee to be fired.  That is the issue here . . . not money. Therefore, I would write a letter to Wal-Mart, telling them that unless that employee is fired, you are prepared to go public with your complaint and proceed with a legal suit against them and their employee for racial discrimination.|`|EGna1nEfaa	Even if you weren't physically harmed, I think you can and should get away with it.

It is even legal for him to follow you after you make an infraction.  They often do this to see whether the suspect makes a greater mistake.<br>  <br>  Since you were charge with possession (of drugs or alcohol), the officer obviously already knew you had it.  He had a right and obligation to follow you and ultimately pull you over.|`|3yrpDNavaa	That's fine, provided your "improper turn into a gas station" is actually a violation of your state's vehicle code.

Basically, because you have to show strong social and economic ties to  your home country. That can be pretty hard for an 18 year old, much less anyone younger. But the US issues tourist visas to infants as well, but based on the parents, not the child.

8OmL54xoaa	Why are these Hellter-Skelter instigators serving in our government? If they keep-up this nonsense they are going to cause racial riots all across the nation.|`|QBH92zsEaa	Please provide weblink to Dept. of Justice entire speech|`|JqJvqd0oaa	The Obamite does not know what he is talking about.|`|UcJg8YG2aa	There are a couple of levels to interpreting those remarks.  At first, they may seem harsh and outdated or even militant due to all the obvious progress we've made as a nation of different races.  I am inclined to agree with this because compared to the rest of the world, the USA is far advanced in race-relation.  Sure, we've had tons of problems but those only came from facing up to our differences and trying to work toward real solutions.  Other countries don't even acknowledge racial problems and even hide them.  There are still places like Turkey where a race is nearly outlawed (the Kurds).  <br>       The US is a racial utopia compared to many spots and truly the "melting pot" we're claiming to be.<br>       Now the other level:  Because we are advanced does not mean we should rest at ease.  The best governments should always still be taken to task in order to keep them at their best and avoid slippage back down to places and pasts we're so proud to be apart from.  The Attorney-General is right to keep us talking and out-in-the-open with our differences.  This ongoing discussion without tribal-warfare or ethnic-cleansing is one of the most amazing things on earth and it's right here and now.  <br>  <br>  I'm against MANY things the Obama administration is for but this is a good one.

nwMBfgcdaa	Several universities offer Bachelor of Community Studies (BACS) degress which Police departments like to see.   You don't need university courses to apply though.  <br>  It really depends where you want to work.  There are several options to becoming an officer.  Places like Ontario and Quebec do their own training.  Edmonton, Calgary, Halifax, Newfoundland Constabulary also do.  They all have their own websites, shouldn't be hard to google.  They will hire people trained elsewhere, but they usually prefer you have two years experience along with the training.  Some pay while you study, others don't. <br>  In PEI, there is Holland College that offers a Police Science program.  It is a 9 month course, 6 there, 3 on the job training. You pay for the course and get hired by municipal forces after graduation.  Most forces on the East coast and some out West will hire you with this training (except the RNC).<br>  I believe there is a Police Acadamy in BC and probably others but I am not familiar with all of them.<br>  Then there is the RCMP.  <a href="http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/recruiting-recrutement/home-accueil/introduction-eng.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/recruiting-rec...</a><br>  Money can be good.  All depends on where you work.  <br>  Training can be hard.  Most places you will be away from your family.  There is a lot of studying.  The physical can be demanding.  Nothing that can't be done though.  <br>  For the first five years, at least, you will be on patrols.  That means shift work.  Places work differently, some have rotating schedules like 7 days on, 6 off, 5 evenings, 4 off, 3 nights, etc.  Some places do 4 12 hours shifts.  Two days, two nights and four off. Usually you have plenty of time to spend with family.  Its when you get into specialized sections where you are called out and work alot of overtime. You will work holidays sometimes.  <br>  Its kind of hard to answer the question without more details of where you want to go.  You can send an email if you want more details.
AA11494150	I'll see if I can go through and cover your points one at a time...<br>  <br>  A police officer is an authorized vehicle, and is allowed to go through the median, even if it is not an emergency.<br>  <br>  Radar can operate when the patrol car is moving, so it is quite common to clock a vehicle moving in the opposite direction.<br>  <br>  Being rude and sarcastic is not appropriate. However, the court has no jurisdiction over officer conduct. They only have jurisdiction on the offense you are charged with. Officer conduct must be addressed through the department.<br>  <br>  A ticket is simply a charging instrument, and the information can be amended at any time. The error will not get the ticket thrown out. In this case, speeding goes to the driver, not the car. If there is enough information on the ticket to identify you, and the officer testifies to the offense, the ticket will stand.<br>  <br>  I will avoid comments about your actual speed, because I was not there. I do know the officer's testimony almost always carries more credibility in court, so if it comes down to your word vs.his, I suspect the court will rule in the officer's favor. <br>  <br>  AS you can see, the answers here are all over the place. I don't expect you to take my word for all this, but feel free to call an attorney. Most don't charge for the initial consultation.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	No, the ticket cannot be thrown out for a minor error.  Yes, he can pull you over and yes, they can clock cars going in the other direction.  My suggestion is to stay off the phone and pay attention to your driving, legal or not.  I seriously doubt you were looking at your spedometer the whole time.  Pay the ticket and learn from it.<br>  <br>  BTW, having a family member on the force doesn't mean you don't have to obey the same laws as everyone else.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	First of all, your mother was illegally trying to use her influence to keep you from getting ticked. This goes on all of the time, but it is wrong and illegal. Why do you think that you are privileged to break the law. His radar works fine in both directions. You are what is wrong with this country! I do not believe you and I hope that the judge does not either.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	I had what I thought would be a good answer for you, but I don't live in VA and I don't know about the laws or the other issues with law enforcement in that state.<br>  <br>  I will, therefore, retract my answer, in compliance with your instructions.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	Yes it can.  Any error on the ticket is a case for dismissal. The ticket also has to be legible, if you cant read what the cop wrote the judge will also dismiss the ticket.  Whether or not you were doing the speed limit I dont know, but you shouldn't use family members as an excuse to break laws.  <br>  <br>  My brother got a ticket and the cross streets that the cop wrote down where he pulled my brother over were wrong, they were actually parallel streets, so there was no way he could have been on the corner of both.  The judge threw out the ticket.  <br>  <br>  I also have a friend who had his car repainted so they took off the name of the car in the back and when he gets pulled over they always put down Chevy camaro when its really a Pontiac firebird.  The judge always throws it out.<br>  <br>  Rock:<br>  It`s a fact, I have seen it done about 5 times, one time with my brother and the other 4 with my friend.  I didnt believe my friend until he took me with him. I heard the judge say it with my own ears, ANY error was a case for dismissal we werent even there 10 minutes.  Was that like a punishment or demotion...being made a traffic school instructor?  Its like what you see in the movies where they become traffic cops or instructors because they cant handle the field work lol<br>  <br>  Why would she have to stop talking on the phone if its not illegal in that state?  She didn't break a law by talking on the phone.  What difference between that and changing the radio station or going through a drive thru and eating/drinking in your car?|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	1 - Caps Lock is pointless and annoying<br>  2 - a simple mistake on a ticket doesn't mean it can be thrown out<br>  3 - your overall tone/attitude/immature comments lead me to believe that you were on your phone not paying the slightest attention to what you were doing (operating a motor vehicle)<br>  4 - police can clock your speed while driving towards you...it's called radar, and it works very well<br>  5 - try for a second to realize how hard/frustrating a police officer's job is....then try to imagine dealing with countless people thinking that they don't 'deserve' a ticket for one reason or another<br>  then, try and imagine trying to be polite to everybody<br>  <br>  <br>  So, to answer your questions.....<br>  your ticket will not be thrown out for that error<br>  if you were speeding, he had every right to pull you over<br>  and it seems like you probably deserve that ticket|`|9kMJJ1giaa	Rock has a PROBLEM!!!!  The officer did have the right to pull you over, I KNOW your ticket must be CORRECT in order to charge you.  My son got out of a similar ticket, and an attorney told us the ticket would have to be thrown out.  It was!  I commend you for not using your mothers job, to get you off.  It sucks that our system works like that, but it does!  Unfortunately!  The SHAME goes to YOUR MOTHER,  for suggesting that to you, as a MOTHER and as an OFFICER of the LAW!!!  It should NOT work like that!!  This is an OFFICER and MOTHER, telling you, it is OK for you to break the law because your mother is an OFFICER!  What kind of morals and values does she have/is she teaching?  OFFICERS of the LAW should expect everyone to OBEY the laws!  Attitudes like hers is what is wrong with our system!|`|SutVrwoHaa	Hi Cherise, <br>  Calm down,  the mistake on your tag won't get you ticket thrown out but it might be of some help.  Lets review for a minute.  You say that you met a trooper on a bridge going the opposite direction and clocked your speed.  Then he turned around at the end of the bridge and came back and pulled you over.  <br>  What has happened here is that he most likely clocked you as the two of your were meeting you.  Not all that uncommon.  But there are a few problems with doing that and on a bridge.  If you were doing 60 and he was doing 60 then the closing speed was 120 mph. The speeds could have actually been a lot higher.  That means that the trooper was only had a few seconds to see your car and it was partially blocked by the bridge.  When he got to the end of the bridge he most likely lost sight of you car before getting turned around.  <br>  What may have happened it that he clocked the another car going much faster and then pulled you over by mistake.  Happens all the time so  stick to your story.  You need to ask the questions to find out if the trooper had visual contact with your vehicle from the time he clocked the car until he stopped you if not you may be able to get it dismissed it's called "reasonable doubt".  You may be able to do this yourself or get a lawyer to do it for you.  It'll cost more to do it, but it might be worth while in the long run.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps.  Remember you work hard for your money make them work hard for it too.|`|tnVrODt3aa	Your best bet is to contact the courts and ask them these questions. They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points put on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!

gasquENMaa	Hello Chris. Technically, stopping for 2 seconds in NOT a full stop and he used this as the probable cause to question you.

ucYwexwJaa	the first respondant is incorrect, you do have an interest in the property, it's your PRIMARY RESIDENCE, secondly, his mortgage company isn't suing him, they're attempting to foreclose on the house so they can sell it to someone who doesn't sit on their azz and not pay their bills.  If you want, move the property to foreclosure and put a bid on the auction when it goes to sale, then you'll not only be living there still but you'll be putting money towards owning it someday rather than dumping your money down the drain.|`|d5c5079cce04b42e4018f3cce72b99f2aa	You would need a lawyer who is proficient in Landlord/Tenant law.

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Between NAFTA and easing of trade restrictions we have ceded the majority of our manufacturing sector to foreign interests. The government has shown no interest in protecting American workers or for that matter American jobs. Unfortunately, we, meaning average people are no better because we accept it willingly and have made Wal-Mart the largest retailer in the world. At the same time we have not really demanded emphasis on fair trade policies and tax structures aimed at home front manufacturing. In fact what we have done is demand more access to cheaper goods and our retailers and government have acted according to that desire. This is of course over-simplified as their are a myriad of other factors relevant to this discussion.|`|kprKXEOSaa	It comes down to how much Americans are willing to pay for merchandise.  <br>  Let's say you buy a little pair of children's gloves at WalMart, actually you can get two pair for $1.00.  That means you're paying $.25 a glove, but WalMart paid at least half that, so $.12 or less per glove.  That $.12 gets split up between materials, overhead and costs for the company who manufactured it, and pay for the workers who run the knitting machine, and shipping to get it from China to here.  So the person who runs the knitting machine to make those gloves makes, what, maybe $1 a day?  Americans wouldn't go for pay that low, but there are people in China and other countries who do.<br>  Basically, as long as Americans demand cheap goods, there will be workers in other countries willing to provide them.  <br>  Part of the problem is also our minimum wage laws.  You can't make the same pair of gloves in the U.S. and make a profit because you have to pay your workers at least minimum wage, and Americans aren't going to pay $10 for a little pair of knit gloves.<br>  We want to have our cake and eat it, too.<br>  <br>  Another thought: I run a small business.  I have a product that is made in the U.S.A.  I thought it would be a big selling point, but people don't care.  If you want to make a profit in this country, which you have to do if you want to stay in business and employ people, you have to manufacture your goods as cheaply as possible--and that basically means, in China.  I will never do that, because I want to keep the money here, but that means that my business will never really compete with other companies who manufacture in China or India.  That's a choice I've made, but the American public is basically driven to purchase the cheaper item, regardless of where it was manufactured.<br>  <br>  Second Edit:  I'm just pointing out observations and trying to make sense of it myself.<br>  I agree with you that it would be better for us if people in the U.S. only bought American-made, it would definitely benefit my business.<br>  But I disagree with you that it is up to government to resolve this.  If people really cared about this issue, there is nothing stopping them from making a personal decision to only buy American-made goods.  You don't need legislation to do that.  Our government leaders aren't really in the position to come out and say "only buy U.S. made goods" because that ticks off other countries, Obama actually had to backpedal from something he said after the stimulus bill passed, because foreign leaders got mad.  It is up to the American Public.  We have to decide we are only going to hire legal American citizens, and we are only going to buy American-made goods, no matter if the cost is a bit higher.  I don't need government telling me what tea to buy--sound familiar?<br>  <br>  People have to decide for themselves that it is important to them, and during difficult economic times, that doesn't seem very likely to happen.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Yes, it is discouraging.  I try to buy American as much as possible but usually settle for something made in China when I can't find an American version.  Nice to see our government is pulling for us.|`|1b9d6f92644c7ecc734f3330365356a8aa	Well, it's global economy now.  Americans gripe about cheap manufactured goods. The Swiss, say, could just as easily gripe about cheap American wheat driving their own farmers out of business.|`|hah4QjZKaa	As individuals, we "vote" with our pocketbooks. Unfortunately, you have to also take what the market gives you. Tax structures have forced businesses to look for the lowest workforce costs; we hardly have tariffs on foreign goods; we are dealing with a global economy but it will take a long time before a worker in India or China will be paid wages similar to those demanded in the States. Meanwhile, some European and Asian manufacturers requiring skilled workers have relocated plants to the US - Volkswagen, Toyota, and Honda for example - since our wages are lower than in Europe or Japan. Labor intensive and low skills jobs like clothing and toy manufacturing are losing ground here. Many of these are still owned by American corporations. National ownership of companies is getting confusing. Utilities in some areas are owned by foreign companies. We buy Nestle products - Swiss owned; we buy Pillsbury - British; buy cell phones from Deutche Telecom (T-Mobile); Fords made in Mexico; Chevy's from South Korea; all looking for a good deal to make out money go further. In other words, the world is a complicated place. There are no easy answers.|`|zNB3tZXraa	Once again, history repeats itself. If you are too young to remember the 1960's when my parents  were complaining that everything was made in Japan, and that they would ruin our economy. Well that didn't happen then and it does not need to happen now. What will ruin this economy, is already in place with this new non-stimulus bill. The beauty of the free market, is that it is the consumer who has the last word as to which company will survive or fail. The consumer does not put up with overpriced or poorly made products forever. They will take their business elsewhere. This is exactly why government should not interfere with the free market. Perhaps you cannot defend the labor practices in China, but you must realize that labor costs in America are much higher than need be. Some of this is because of the unions, and some because of supply and demand, as in housing a few years ago. Also keep in mind that a lot of our "pollution" industries have been pushed overseas and into Mexico.We still have an abundant work force and have more technology , or smokeless industry, here in the U.S. But this will also vanish if this new stimulus bill with it's hidden agenda is allowed to affect American business. Lastly, when white college students don't want to do physical labor for $20 per hour during the summer, well, of course there are Hispanics willing to do it.|`|XoLdJbXBaa	I'm with you.  It is unbelievable.  If only people would boycott those goods, but unfortunately there are too many people who are shortsighted that would rather save money right now than see the long term effects.

What was the defendant's name in [some case name they'd studied]? Do you know?"<br>  <br>  "Yeah, I know, but I'm not telling you. If it's on the exam, I'll get it right and you won't."<br>  <br>  My husband said the uncooperative guy obviously felt no shame and that a number of people nodded their agreement.

AA11104372	Your dentist wouldn't have been able to "poke a hole" in your tooth, if it wasn't already decayed.  If you don't like this dentist, by all means don't go to her any more, but you're being a little ridiculous when it comes to wanting to have her beat up.|`|78Xb7enMaa	There are of course bad Dentists, as there are bad practitioners in all professions. Your dentist should be professional and offer a reasonable standard of care, regardless of her personal feelings. When she was 'counting' she was charting your teeth and any cavities/fillings, using a mirror and a probe. She may have been testing an area of decay when she broke through the enamel, sometimes decay is impossible to see without x-rays or using a probe. I would get a second opinion as that cavity, whether decayed or not, will need filling or it will deepen causing pain. Your gum should not still be bleeding, I advise you to apply some pressure if the site of the bleeding isn't too sore, with a clean gauze pad or tissue. If the bleeding continues or is heavy get medical advice. I also suggest you complain to the NHS by clicking on the link below select Health care Organisations and click to give 'feedback'. The same site can show you local NHS Dentists in your area, and if I were you I'd go to a different Dentist for a second opinion without mentioning you've complained about your previous Dentist. Please don't judge all Dentists by the one where you have had your unfortunate experiences, most Dentists are dedicated to higher standards of patient care and I hope you regain your trust in a better one.|`|hsyI1DxDaa	She sounds like a nightmare, but I reckon you should just try get a new dentist.|`|yDWZQtqOaa	Totally Report her she has no right to do that|`|GpcbuAfmaa	Wow don't let that b!tch get away with that|`|IWafFSP9aa	There is a UK company called the Dental Law Partnership.

AA11494150	Requirements for expungement vary with each jurisdiction. You need to call the court you were convicted in to see if you qualify.|`|48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	Employers in California are not supposed to consider arrests which did not result in convictions, which is the result of DEJ (which means Deferred Entry of Judgment)--there is no conviction.  Moreover, you are deemed never to have been arrested, you can say you were never arrested, and the record cannot be used in any way without your consent.  (Penal Code section 1000.4.)  You may want to speak to an employment law attorney regarding these violations.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, you want to get an order sealing your record so that even the arrest will be unavailable.  The court has discretion to make such an order under Penal Code section 851.9.  I would suggest going to the clerk's office and asking for the form the court uses for sealing under that statute, and file it.  If sealing is granted, be sure that the clerk sends that information to the Department of Justice.|`|OVUkamlpaa	I think some details are missing... why wasn't this your fault?

AbJNFwOIaa	First, it is important to clarify some terminology. There is absolutely no such thing as "copyrighting" something or having something "copyrighted."  Copyright is automatically attached once a work becomes fixed to a tangible medium.  The copyright can be registered with the Copyright Office. However, registration has nothing to do with actually obtaining the copyright.<br>  <br>  Copyright generally belongs to the author of the work.  Thus, if you create the song, then copyright to the song will belong to you in most cases.  If you want to assign the copyright to your group, then you will need a written assignment.  Simply including your group name in the copyright marking (i.e., the circle C symbol) is not enough to effect a copyright transfer.

If unemp in you area is more than $300 per week, then you can request up to $400 (original amount) or the max benefit, whichever is lower.<br>  <br>  Again, this is general, different areas have different guidelines, AND your employer has to not contest it.|`|tvS755yxaa	It depends on your state.<br>  <br>  You could apply for under-employment, but most employers frown upon this so instead of getting a lil over 25 hours, you can get a pink slip and get full blown unemployment.<br>  <br>  I've heard of this happening.<br>  <br>  Check your state laws and rules regarding unemployment/under-employment and see if the risks outweigh the benefits.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|LKIsoYdgaa	no, be grateful you still have a job and don't whine about the cut back.

Give her mother a call if you can and explain, might get some help from her.|`|ttNa7fVhaa	Sounds like the girl need emotional help, a la a psychiatrist.  My advice would be to tell her parents what you know.  Is she on drugs?  Does she need rehab?  An intervention might work too.|`|6utUL9Hiaa	She should be put in a psychiatric hospital unit where she can be watched- please tell your parents, school counselors, and anyone else of authority- this girl is in serious need of help...You can also call the Good Samaritan Hotline for better counseling advise.|`|5aa6c255769d2581cd3da1bfae8f73bbaa	Sounds like an attention starved person.|`|1FFslmE8aa	If you are really worried about your friend and can't personally do anything about it....call the cops.

They do have proof from her mouth and her submitted test. As for you, sadly, there may be nothing you can do about this. They trick people daily into getting the information they need. Which is what they did to you, probably knowing your young, they could take advantage of the situation. You should have never told them you did drugs and furthermore never have told them you would submit a test. Once they said "Do you do drugs..." An you answered yes, what was there point of testing you if they weren't going to do anything about it? They were going to test you to have that proof that you are because your statement is not enough without being on paper, signed. That was clue number one to not submit it freely. Sadly, you cooperated with them to the fullest and they still back-stabbed you.<br>  <br>  All you can really try for, is entrapment. This is when for example they say or do something in hopes of getting you to say or do something, but then they don't follow through with there word. THis becomes entrapment, but most of them are smart and know how to word and avoid this, so your chances aren't to good.<br>  <br>  But in the end, you have to think about what they said. They said it would be ok if you told them and submitted a test. Well, it is ok, you didn't go to jail, you didn't get fined, you simply have to attend a rehab class. In society, to the judge and court, this is going to rule in they're favor, they are going to see your age, and your test results, and explain to you... "Look ma'am, they said everything would be ok, and it is. Although they never said they wouldn't try to help, and thats what they're doing, is trying to help..." Your taking this as something awful, which in my mind, it is! You smoked some reefer, big deal, but the courts will see it as a drug and something awful which you need help for.

He is listed as single and acting single; ie dating more than one woman.

He most likely is not willing to admit to being committed to someone because he does not want to close the possibility of getting together with someone else. Over all I"m guessing it's none of your concern. She can decide if she's open to other possibilities. I'm sure you could just ask her why it's that way.
GSJ9gqVWaa	Family law is not my strong point, but I believe you can nominate a gaurdian for you children in your will.  If they were unfit, your nomination would not prevent social services removing the child in to care, but otherwise it should pretty much like your child is their child.  As with most law, there is some paper work and a court trip involved, but only if you die before your child turns 18.  They would be more willing to remove a child who has not yet settled and is not with their natural parents, so I wouldn't nominate anyone who is borderline unfit to care for a child, but your parents seem wonderful foster parents.<br>  <br>  I would check this when you have your will drafted.  This is usually within the ability of any sober and literate adult armed with a legal advice book available from any library in the country, but it is best to have it drafted by a solicitor, partly for the peace of mind that comes from knowing that the document that decides who looks after your child and who gets your property after you die has been drawn up by someone who spent four years at university learning how to draft them right.<br>  <br>  Most firms of solicitors will also keep a copy or the original of your will in a safe at their premises for free or for a small fee if you pay them to draft the will.  It is generally a good idea to have a copy of your will somewhere that is not where you live, because if the unthinkable happens you don't want the only copy of the document setting out how you want your son raised to be lost with you.<br>  <br>  It is possible that your parents might be allowed to raise your child even if you did not make a will, but I can't be very sure about that, and in any case without a will you can't choose who gets your money and goods (there might be momentos that you want to leave to particular friends or family for example).  In any case, raising a child is expensive, so you might want to make sure your parents get something to help, especially if you want your son to go to university.<br>  <br>  You are making a good choice drawing up your will now, when the possibility of anything happening is remote.  It can be quite a depressing activity of your death is a real possibility in a decade or two.<br>  <br>  Good luck raising your son.  I am afraid us boys can be a bit tiring to parent.|`|CowgOqXTaa	A will covers the disposal of your *property*, not your children. <br>  <br>  If you both die, you can leave instructions for who you would "like" to care for him after your death, but it is not binding on family court. <br>  <br>  The reason is simple - you might ask your parents to have him.... but what if, by the time you die, your father is on parole for child molestation and your mother has Alzheimer's? I know this sounds extreme - but the law has to consider all eventualities.|`|624b94938d509e58bec9e61282417d76aa	the courts mostly likely would decide who will have custody|`|65c830b566c8cb5f9d618316e611c8beaa	A will , despite any challenges that might crop up after your death is at least a good start and probably in most cases better than nothing.<br>  <br>  In an ideal world you should have professional advice in drawing it up but although not the best option the courts have treated what I will call DIY documents as valid.<br>  <br>  So if in a worst case scenario you have an urgent need of a 'will' you could try drawing one up yourself. The essential details are that:<br>  <br>  You declare ' This is the last will of ..... made this (date) and I revoke all previous wills and codicils ( you put that even if you haven't made any other wills ) 'I appoint xvxvx as my executor(s) ( up to a max of four people )' Then it is usual to put details of your funeral wishes, to say that after your funeral costs and debts have been paid that you want certain things to happen, such as who is to have any particular property, including the proceeds of your house and residuary estate ( that's whats left after any other specific bequests ). In your case express your wishes about your children and I expect you would want to leave all / most of your property to him to say receive when he reaches a certain age ..( this is why and where you need current advice ).<br>  <br>  You then have to sign your will in the presence of two people who witness your signature. The witnesses do not have to read your will, only that they must both be present at the same time as each other and both see you sign. Also the witnesses must not be beneficiaries or the spouses of a beneficiary. An executor can be a beneficiary.<br>  <br>  I stress this is very much a basic and emergency situation. Remember also that you can remake your will as you like as long as it is clear that you reject earlier ones and it can be ceratin which is your latest.
ec6d6526154860f9cab361f34526d848aa	Readily available is just that - a gun assessable to a driver or passenger fits that description.  The way firearms and ammo is transported is spelled out in the Illinois Compiled Statutes.  i do not know why an attorney would ask questions here....|`|8hAhmlJjaa	You are over-thinking this, you would make a good lawyer.  Readily available means that the ammunition is within close proximity of the firearm, ie; the firearm is on the second floor of the house and the ammunition is on the same level.  Or, the firearm is in the passenger compartment of the car, and the ammunition is in the glove box.  Being able to order it on line, or going to the Walmart, does not make it readily available.  That would be like saying you have food readily available because it is at the grocery store.

AA11206283	A. The mandatory break law only applies to minors under the age of 18. Minors must be given a thirty (30) minute meal period after five (5) consecutive hours of work.

GSJ9gqVWaa	That depends on what the reprimand and warning are for and what kind of police clearance, as well as how long ago they are.<br>  <br>  If they are for trespass on a prohibited place and espionage, I don't think you would pass vetting to work for MI6.  <br>  <br>  If you mean working with children, which is the most common kind, then that will depend on how long ago it happened and what you did.<br>  <br>  Violence is very bad, as are sexual offences.  If you don't have either of those, then you are probably fine to work with children.  Of course to work with children, you have to show the certificate to your employer, and they may not want to hire you if you have convictions for fraud or theft.  Any offence of violence (including robbery), a public order offence (such as threatening behaviour) or any sexual offence is very bad for working with children.<br>  <br>  I am a little concerned that you have two offences on file.  If they are both stupid kids stuff such as possession of cannabis, drunk and disorderly or shoplifting you should be fine, unless both of them are shoplifting, which I think would look to most people like you made a habit of it.<br>  <br>  This all assumes that you are clean now, and can give references to any employer to confirm that you do not spend your days and nights stoned out of your brain on pot.<br>  <br>  If you are just applying for a normal job, and are worried about what will show up, I am nor sure how long juvenille warnings and reprimands stay liable to be disclosed, I think the rule is 5 years.  If you are actually sentenced, most offences become spent after a few years when it won't show up unless you are applying to certain jobs, such aa a police officer, accountant etc.<br>  <br>  In general it is best with juvenile offences that are genuinely behind you to be entirely up front, explain that you made a mistake when you were young, that you realise it was stupid, and that you are past that stuff now.  Just don't make it sound like you think everyone does it, or it doesn't matter.  Most people did a few things the wrong side of the line when they were growing up, but they don't think of themselves as having done that sort of thing because they weren't caught.<br>  <br>  In theory Reprimands and warnings never become spent, so should always be declared, so the quidance on when to stop declaring them is based on when most police forces will have destroyed the records showing the warning.
pYRZcfsJaa	I would say intel, only because you could get a job a lot easier on the outside if you have experience in Intel and also have the secret security clearance... just a thought<br>  <br>  but infantry will open a lot less doors than Intel will|`|C7wjR42Daa	I would say intel only because you are not 100 percent motivated to be in the infantry and it is not a place for those types.

I have a few friends who are in that. You can't just get into it. It's a tough gig to get into fromt he getgo. You have to been a sergeant or are going to pickup sergeant within the next couple of months. There's a pretty strict screening process as well. Even then, the school is balls to the wall hard. They weed people out like crazy.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to shut you down. Just be prepared for the stone hard facts.<br>  <br>  The snipers. Heh, if I switch from IRR to AR, I'm getting into a STA platoon. Sniper school isn't going to be what you think it is. There's not a whole lot of shooting involved. There's tons of testing involved both academic and practical application. I've heard of them starting with classes of 80 and graduating five. It's not uncommon to hear about someone who has gone through it two or three times in order to pass.<br>  <br>  In order to become a sniper, you can't just ask to go. You have to first pass the screening to get into a STA platoon (a sniper platoon). The screening is a kick in the nuts. If you make it through the screening and become part of the platoon, they'll show you the ropes from there. You'll learn a lot from the guys who have been doing it a long time. It's better preparation for sniper school.<br>  <br>  The infantry and/or snipers are really hard MOS's. However you'll have bragging rights like no other. You'll be the definition of Billy Badass. There aren't a lot of job opportunities open to infantrymen unless you're interested in private contracting work with groups like Blackwater. I will say though, the pay for the security contractors is freaking phenomenal. A friend of mine is getting out soon. He was in Force Recon. He landed a job with a company that's going to start him at $175,000 /yr.<br>  <br>  General intel will leave you with a TS clearance (in most cases) which will open all sorts of doors for you. More diversity in jobs.<br>  <br>  One more thing added onto the infantry thing. You'll learn how to be a leader and how to take charge of things. I honestly think being in the infantry was better for me as a person than it was for a career.
