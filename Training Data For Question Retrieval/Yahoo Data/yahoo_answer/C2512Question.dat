20090128212401AAHVO3j	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I wouldn't even call this a story, but it's about love and it's short...please read and enjoy:):)?	She always dreamt of a handsome, presentable, respectable, sweet, loyal and amiable man to come, perfect as a prince charming, to whisk her away to the life of no troubles. He had to be perfect, in order for her to fall in love with him...perfect. And then, a transition, a change happened in her deepest thoughts and she ended up falling in love with a man, who was flawed even more than a regular human; she never realized how...   Her whole life she hated men like him, egoistic, selfish, cynical, proud and rude. But he had a certain edge to him, a certain craziness that attracted her; something she’d never experienced before. Though rebellious, he was outstandingly intelligent, and goal-oriented. Most important of all though, he was mysterious, with a sarcastic smile frozen on his face as if to hide his real feelings, his real self.   Real feelings...ah, yes! That’s what intrigued her the most. With her wild imagination, she always knew what his real thoughts were. She always believed that his heart was good, that his soul was pure, as that of a child’s...yet he had to mask it all because of his fear of life and his fear of love. At least that’s what she thought, until he did...fall in love.    He fell in love reasonably, though not with her; reasonably meaning, with a girl that was of good looks, fortune and intelligence and. However, she played him like a fool, took his heart and butchered it...it was the first time anyone ever saw him cry. He never realized the one who really loved him, was right in front of him; the girl who was ready to take his flaws and make them her epitome of perfection; the girl for whom he meant the world. He pushed her away, thus making himself even more perfect than before...staying mysterious, unattainable and wild.

20090128211916AAlQ76U	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Are H.P. Lovecraft and his followers' works of literature, copyrighted?	I'm curious. As a writer, I've always wondered at the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, and his cult of other writers, going on about the Great Old Ones, such as the very well known Cthulhu. Anyways, if I were to use, creatures such as 'Cthulhu', would this be considered plagerism? The fact that I see all these writers using them, including Stephen King, a guy not even in the cult, makes me think, that this is mythology, and now a cult, so it's thought of as a religion. So, I'd assume, no?

20090225155423AA3wxtY	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Thoughts on this plotline?	Title: The Spark   Genre: Fantasy/Romance   A young girl begins to suspect that the world around her is being corrupted by an unkonw ource. melanie learns that an omnipowerful deity, known as the Being, has decided to purge the world of evil by sending down demons to destroy humanity in an apocalyptic event. She also discovers that in her first life, she had been a clairvoyant who forsaw how to destroy the demons' leader, Lucifer, and was killed for it. She was reincarnated because she died at too young an age; Melanie struggles throughout the novel to bring back the elusive memories from her past life but can't seem to grasp them. She falls in love with James, who, along with his siblings, had been protecting her for years on their clairvoyant father's orders. James takes her to the spark, a city built inside a mountain- originally a mine that had been caved in. It consists of the few survivors left in the world. The novel is resolved when Laurel, Melanie's older sister, resolves that she's possessed by Lucidfer and begs Melanie to kill her, which she does. She and James step out into the sunlight with Caleb, her younger brother, and the book ends with Mel grieving for her sister's death but declaring her determination and hope for the future of the Spark.      Initial reaction? Would your read it? Original or creative? Please and thank you.

Each paragraph must explain your novel's attitude toward some kind of technology. You can talk about the same attitude in technology in each one, or you can show different attitudes and technology in each one. This depends upon how your novel treats changes in technology.       2. One paragraph must show how your novel is similar to one of the classic science fiction stories described in this lesson. One paragraph must show how your novel is different from one of those stories.       3. You must use at least one example from your novel in each paragraph to help the reader understand your point.       4. In one paragraph, you must use a direct quotation from your story, the way you were taught earlier in the semester. In one paragraph, you must paraphrase something from your novel, as you were taught in your persuasive essay.       5. In each paragraph, you must put your topic sentence in italic type, like this.       In each paragraph, you must use transitions. You must put the transitions in bold type, like this.

Se habla del Dios del Universo, pero no comprendemos el significado de Universo. ?Por qué digo esto? Porque nos creemos el ombligo del universo, como si todas las estrellas de nuestra constelación, como si todas las constelaciones, como si todas las supra galaxias y todos los ejambres de galaxias conocidos y reconocidos por la astronomía moderna estuvieran ahí para adornar nuestras noches. ?De que es Dios Rey y Se?or? ?De un Universo no habitado, exepto por unos croma?ones canivales llamados humanos, que todavía promulgan la guerra, en vez de la hermamdad y la paz entre hermanos?      No sabemos, ni tenemos la más mínima idea de la grandeza de la obra de Dios; de ese gran arquitecto del Universo, al que muchos niegan y al que otros llaman de mil maneras y  que nos inspira amor sólo cuando nos enajenamos un poco del mundo de los temores y las preocupaciones.      Debemos disfrutar de las locuras de un buen episodio de ficción que dirija nuestra mente a nuevos caminos en la imaginación.
