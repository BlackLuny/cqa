rVUvopaLaa	my personal recommendation is for you to contact a practicing lawyer in the Phils specifically for annulment.  <br>  you need to seek recommendation from relatives or friends in the Phils if they know some lawyer who can help you but won't make money out of your misery.  <br>  or if not ask some Filipino friends in Canada who might have some contacts in the Phils.  <br>  maintain a low profile cause you'll be at risk of getting charge of exorbitant professional fees for they are aware that you are earning dollars.  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|7ONAv4vYaa	If you were wed in the Philippines, you can only file for annulment. There is no divorce in Philippine law.<br>  <br>  I think you can file a lawsuit to you wife. I think abandonment, unwillingness to procreate or adultery are the possible cases you can file.<br>  <br>  Just get a lawyer. You can contact the Philippine consulate in Canada to assist you with legalities.|`|9h7ITcoNaa	File an annulment case in the Philippines!

Neither actually sells the travel and when you go to buy you have to go to an external site so you never actually book with Travelzoo or Kayak but with the website you get shot off to. <br>  <br>  Kayak is my pick because instead of just giving you links to the other sites it searches them itself and shows you what the price of each is. Travelzoo however has an excellent top 20 list but other than that I would not use it.<br>  <br>  I have used kayak.com multiple times and have not had a problem but remember you are not booking with kayak but with the site you choose from kayak.

The Zionist Gang Has Turned the Desert into an Oasis.<br>  <br>  Dr. Yousuf Al-Qaradhawi: We use trains and planes, but they are not our trains or planes. The (Westerners) manufacture them and export them to us. True, we can buy the most magnificent things in the world products for our homes and for ourselves. Our people can buy the most luxurious cars, Rolls-Royce or Mercedes 500 or 700, models S, M, and L with all the luxuries. We own them, but we don't manufacture them. We don't even produce a single nail in any of these cars. Others do this for us.<br>  <br>  The income of the entire Arab world, including the oil-producing countries, does not reach the that of a European country, such as Spain. Spain – let alone Germany, France, Britain, or Italy. Just Spain, which is at the bottom of the list of industrial countries... The income of the entire Arab world does not reach it. How come? Because we don't work, and if we do work, we don't do it professionally.<br>  <br>  They conducted a survey of the average time that a government employee spends working in a certain Arab country. The average was 27 minutes a day. 27 minutes! The rest of the time he drinks coffee, reads newspapers, and goes on errands here and there. Only a small number of people work. The rest do not.<br>  <br>  In the mid 1970s I went to Germany. We arrived during in the morning. I asked the guy who took me from the airport to the convention hall… As I was passing through the empty streets, I asked him how come the streets were not busy, like in our countries. He said: "People are at work." After 7 p.m. he took me back to the hotel, and the streets were empty. I said to him: "What's going on, the streets are empty again." He said: people are back home from work, and they are exhausted. All they want is to eat their dinner, watch the news, and then go to bed, because early next morning they have to wake up for hard work. They commute more than an hour to work and back, and spend an hour at lunch. They work non-stop.<br>  <br>  We are a nation that doesn't work. How can we develop if we don't work? When we do work, we don't do it professionally. We keep saying "Don't worry, later, later…" Islam teaches us to do things professionally. Doing things professionally is a religious duty. The Prophet said that Allah ordered to excel in everything. He imposed excellence and professionalism. Professionalism must be followed in everything. "If you kill, do it properly, and if you slaughter, do it properly." Even when killing, you must do well.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, we do not excel in either military or civil industries. We import everything from needles to missiles. This is our nation. We still haven't manufactured an engine in our Arab countries. We assemble parts, but have no manufacturing industries. India has manufactured a car, and even a plane, while we still go around in circles like a bull in who turns a grinding mill or a water weal until it reaches exactly where it started.<br>  <br>  How come the Zionist gang has managed to be superior to us, despite being so few? It has become superior through knowledge, through technology, and through strength. It ahs become superior to us through work. We had the desert before our eyes but we didn't do anything with it. When they took over, they turned it into a green oasis. How can a nation that does not work progress?

Of course you can't get anywhere without your passport so I am not quite sure what you mean by your question.  Most of the time when you are asked for Identification in asia they want your passport.  However for simple transfers and picking up things are travel agency's etc. a drivers license will work.  A hot tip... Go to the Auto Club and get and international drivers license.  There is a section on the license that shows what kinds of vehicles you can drive.  Sweet talk the lady into checking the motor bike box and as many other types of vehicles as possible.

Are there any nightclubs we can go to? <br>  <br>  A: Unfortunately, Vegas doesn't offer much in the way of nightlife for the under-21 set. However, we can tell you about a couple of cool places in town that allow all ages at some of their concerts. Check out the House of Blues at Mandalay Bay or The Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel. Both places periodically feature shows that welcome people of all ages. <br>  <br>  Q: If we're not 21, can we still rent a hotel room on the Strip? <br>  <br>  A: Age policies vary greatly by hotel. All our hotel pages list the minimum age to book a room. The vast majority of hotels on the Strip do require you to be 21 to reserve a hotel room. There are a few notable exceptions: Try Las Vegas Hilton. At last check, this hotel allowed those 18 and older with a valid credit card to book a room. There also are a number of smaller properties off the Strip that allow those 18 and over. <br>  <br>  Q: We're coming to Vegas and we know we can't hang out in the casinos if we're not 21. So, what can we do all day so we won't be bored? <br>  <br>  A: In Vegas, you'll never be bored, no matter what age you are. If you like thrill rides, head over to  The Roller Coaster at New York - New York and the Big Shot at the Stratosphere. If you're a video-game buff, check out Gameworks across the street from the New York - New York. During the day, Jillian's is the place to be for arcades, bowling and more (Jillian's does switch over to the 21-and-older crowd at night). For something different, try Vegas Indoor Skydiving. For you music-loving beach bunnies, Mandalay Beach presents the Mandalay Beach concerts during the summer months. Check out our list of other attractions. There's something for everyone. <br>  <br>  Q: If you're under 21 can you still go to all the famous Vegas shows? <br>  <br>  A: Most shows in Vegas will allow people under 21. Check out some hip shows such as Blue Man Group or Cirque Du Soleil's Mystere and O or visit our shows page and check the age restrictions for the particular show that piques your interest. <br>  <br>  Q: I'm in town for a bachelor/bachelorette party. Will I be allowed in the adult shows? <br>  <br>  A: Each show has different age restrictions, but there are some adult shows that allow those 18 and older to enjoy, such as Crazy Girls,  MGM Grand's Crazy Horse Paris and Fantasy.  Chippendales allows those 18 and older in their show but ticket holders must be 21 for entry into the adjacent  Flirt Lounge. As for strip clubs, as long as the club does not serve alcohol, you're allowed in. <br>  <br>  Q: We've done the shows and the attractions for people under 21 and there are still a few days left in our vacation. What next? <br>  <br>  A: There's no shortage of interesting sights to see in and around Vegas. Have a look at our tours page and go exploring. You don't have to be 21 to shop. Grab that credit card and check out the Fashion Show Mall, the Forum Shops,Grand Canal Shoppes or the Miracle Mile Shops. For some deals, you can also head over to the Las Vegas Outlet Center. You're on vacation, so why not relax? Head to one of Vegas' many spas. As long as you're 18, you can indulge. You might also want to catch some rays by the pool or enjoy a great meal at one of Vegas' many unique restaurants. But if you want a permanent souvenir of Vegas, go home with a tattoo.|`|WAyxjGtEaa	At 18 you have a problem. You can not drink or gamble legally. Some casinos will not let you even stop on the gaming floor due to your age. Some clubs might let you in but do not count on it. If you do shows and sight see you can still have fun. But remember you will be carded(ID check) at a lot of spots.|`|XxkzzZceaa	Being 18, you are very limited in what you can do. Clubs, bars, and gambling are pretty much out. And don't believe the hype that "they" will let you in.

sby0C51haa	If there is a mail box or a community bulletin board at your home resort, you can put a “For sale” sign.  This will pressure the developer specially if they sell it for $20,000 USD and you offer it for $5,000.  Sometimes on the fine print of some sale agreements says that the developer has the first right to buy if your place is ever sold.  I have heard of developers paying the money (as long as is not too much) just to take the sign out.<br>   <br>  To resale or rent  a timeshare is a hard task, the basic rule is not to pay money up-front, don’t be another victim of a scam.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately over 50% of people that really need to sell their timeshare falls for this resale scams where they charge money upfront and less than 10% of them use their only real option which is to post it or offer it trough free advertising options as much, and as many sites as they can (it is ok to pay a few dollars to post in a great place but no more that $20 to $30).<br>  <br>  Timeshares do not have resale value and in most situations you would take a loss in what you paid for, as they resale for less than $2000 USD.<br>  <br>  There are some free classified ads where you can start posting:<br>   <br>  <a href="http://timeshareownerscommunity.com/" rel="nofollow">http://timeshareownerscommunity.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://craigslist.com" rel="nofollow">http://craigslist.com</a><br>  <a href="http://ebay.com" rel="nofollow">http://ebay.com</a><br>  <a href="http://recycler.com/" rel="nofollow">http://recycler.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://usfreeads.com/" rel="nofollow">http://usfreeads.com/</a>  <br>  <a href="http://www.inetgiant.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.inetgiant.com/</a>|`|siHN027laa	I really got hammered with requests from various Time Share sellers and websites that want to sell your timeshare for you.

AI2SRjLaaa	ok ok ok<br>  <br>  I understand what you mean, Australia is so culturally similar to NZ more than any other country, it doesn't make any sense why we are not a country.<br>  <br>  However, imagine if you were a kiwi, would you like your islands to be ruled by a little country town in the ACT called canberra? No of course not, because they know that NZ would be completely overwhelmed by Australia in every other aspect such as jobs, economy, etc, it's like giving away your sovereignty. However, as an Australian, if some sort of NZ-Aus republic did come into fruition, I wouldn't mind our capital in Wellington. <br>  <br>  If such a union did come into existant, I would expect it to be called something along the lines of 'the republic of Australia and New Zealand'.<br>  <br>  but I don't think it would ever happen. Simply because of the fact that the NZ would not stand a chance. If NZ and Aus were relatively the same size, with same population, same economy, then yeah maybe.<br>  --------------------------------------<br>  <br>  In fiction though: Wouldn't it be an amazing country if it did happen? Although I wouldn't want it to happen because of other reasons.|`|Df68IhOCaa	Like it or not NZ is unofficially a state of Australia when you consider there main banks are Australian owned and they buy Australian cars like the Holden Commodore and Ford Falcons it will be enviable when NZ is officially a Australian state.|`|xs2mpYjWaa	Another stupid question..

Vlp50eEGaa	Here you go again.  Do you drink the pool water?  Only water that I would recommend not to drink is tap water from a sink.  Drink bottle water and don't go swimming in your toilet. Do you let your kids go swimming in the ocean?  I would then recommend that you stay at a good resort.  Most hotels do use chemcials to kept the water clean and clear.  If you stay at some 2 star hotel you may find they don't take as good care of the pool as they should.|`|AA11310208	Don't worry It won't kill them .|`|NXBmcEz7aa	The taste of the water is not good, because it is salty.  However, it is not poisonous and won't do that much harm you are afraid. A little salt is actually good for the body, isn't it.  Just warn your kids not to drink too much water in the pool.  They have safe drinking water in the hotel.<br>  Enjoy your holiday and don't worry that much.  No reported sickness yet have been heard from drinking that little amount of water from the pool.  If it isn't really safe, the government won't let them operate that swimming pool.

PSiNv7gUaa	Not sure how to get the promo codes, but I have flown with them before, to Orlando.  I have heard that on the flights to Vegas they have everyone put in a dollar and then draw a passenger's name to win all the money.  They're a great airline for the price, there's no in-flight entertainment and you have to pay for snacks and drinks, but that's what keeps their prices down.  They only do non-stop flights, so that's a plus.  I have flown with them twice and was very satisfied both times.
Q3kLsH1waa	as the "law" goes, if you are driving in the capitol, then you are allowed to drive with an American license. if you plan on going to the outer Provinces, you will need an international license. but remember, here in Argentina laws of the road are many, just like the U.S., but UNLIKE the U.S. not too many people follow these rules, and are seldom ticketed. for example, in areas we happen to drive through that we believe are "questionable safe" , we treat stop lights like stop signs, and have never been ticketed. a couple of times a cop was sitting right there!! we have come to BA for about 15 years to visit and have never had a problem driving anywhere in BA or other Provinces with our American license , but be sure to also carry your passport.|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	See site below and scroll down to section on "Traffic Safety and road Conditions"  for your answer.|`|W5VqTPQRaa	I'd reccomend not driving in Argentina.  You might as well write yourself a ticket.  The cops look out for foreign drivers, especially once you get outside of the big city.  If you need to go places, it is better to take a bus or fly, which seems expensive but you can really find good deals on the web for cheap local flights.  Inside the city everybody uses busses and the subway, so u don't have to worry.  let me know if you need any more advice on BA, i've lived there for many many years now.

YhECDSKRaa	Between Oahu, Maui, Honolulu. 1 being the most and 3 being the least.<br>  <br>  Honolulu is a part of Oahu, so I am just going to respond to Oahu vs Maui.<br>  <br>  Which area is the most busiest area?  Oahu is much busier than Maui.<br>  <br>  Which area has the most job opportunities? Oahu by far<br>  <br>  Which area is the most expensive to live?  Maui, everything needs to be shipped just a bit further.<br>  <br>  Which area is pretty laid back but at the same time it has a good job opportunities?  Parts of Oahu are kind of laid back & job opportunities are better.<br>  <br>  I heard in Maui I could experience more of that paradise feel and have pretty good jobs at the same time, is that true?  True to the paradise part, not so much on the jobs part.<br>  <br>  My rent was anywhere from $1500-$2000 in washington dc metropolitan area. Which area has the similar rent cost? and what's the place condition like for that rent amount? I don't know about Maui's rentals.  You will probably need to pay close to 2K for anything decent on Oahu.<br>  <br>  If Maui is little less expensive then Oahu, will I get a better place in Maui for paying approx. $1600?  Unfortunately, Maui is more expensive<br>  <br>  Your biggest challenge will be finding a job that pays you enough to keep up with the cost of living here.|`|Bv0dPwCDaa	Oahu busiest with most job opps,,Oahu most expensive compared to other islands,,,Maui slightly more.

Especially Oahu, because it is one of the most developed and populated of all the islands. Just like the mainland, it is hard to get work here nowadays. Unless if you are a doctor or a nurse. Nowadays, hospitals are always looking for doctors or nurses. There is a big shortage. Besides that, it is very hard to find work. A lot of people are unemployed, just like that mainland. <br>  <br>  If you lucky enough to get a job here, the worst you can do is earn minimum wage , which is about 7 dollars an hour. Maybe you can afford to pay like 300 or 400 dollars a month if you live with a room mate. There are always good room mate deals on craiglist. <br>  <br>  It's a bad time to move here if you don't know where are you going to be working or staying. A lot of mainlanders move here thinking they will get a job right away, but they are still unemployed. <br>  <br>  I recommend you come and visit here, and see if you like it. Living here is nice, I love it. But I wouldn't have never moved here if I didn't get the job offer to move here. I am a medical doctor. I make about $245,000 a year, so I live quite comfortably. <br>  <br>  Maybe go to college first and medical school. Doctors live really well here. Good luck

48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	Your best bet is to stay in Virginia and take the Metro into DC.<br>  <br>  The guy that says that the Maryland side is safer is pulling your leg.  The Virginia side is safer (Fairfax County, Arlington County).  The Maryland side (Prince Georges County) is notorious for crime.<br>  <br>  The big question is where is the event going to be held?  The USSS has a training facility up in Beltsville, MD (that's Montgomery County, I think) and it's a bit safer than PG County.  But, maybe they are having their thing downtown.|`|AA11383464	no place that is less than $100 a night is going to be safe.  I suggest the capitol hill suites or courtyard at Navy yard|`|PUO2y0c2aa	I work in DC.  I can honestly tell you, it depends on where you'll be.  A quick Google search indicated that you'd be at the Renaissance Hotel located at 999 9th Street, NW.  The NW section is probably the safest quadrant of town, followed by NE, SE, then SW.<br>  <br>  During the day, you'll be fine.  At night I would be more inclined to stay away from the NE and SE sections of town.  That includes Capitol Hill and Anacostia.  While there are some great places in NE (i.e. Eastern Market, Union Station and the Library of Congress) I don't know that I would venture out that way without knowing the area.<br>  <br>  The expo will be about 5-6 blocks away from Chinatown/Gallery Place.  There's a bunch of great restaurants and shopping down there.<br>  <br>  I live in Alexandria, VA and there are plenty of nice hotels in Crystal City (Arlington, VA) that might be in your price range.  The nice thing about Crystal City is that there are some restaurants in that area and you are close to the Metro.  There are also places in the Clarendon and Courthouse area of VA too.<br>  <br>  Maryland has some great places too, but there are more places that are Metro accessible with a hotel in VA and DC than there are in MD.<br>  <br>  The big concern I have for you is how you'll be getting from point A to point B.  DC has the Metro system (www.wmata.com) which is fairly easy to navigate.  I'd recommend that before attempting to drive around the city.<br>  <br>  A quick search on hotels.com recommended 10+ hotels all within walking distance of the metro and under $100.  <br>  <br>  Have a great time here.|`|Lf16A5sYaa	If you stay in Northwest you'll be okay.<br>  <br>  Plus if you look in the Crystal City area right across the Potomac in Virginia near the Pentagon, you should find a decent place for around $100 on weekends (which are cheaper in DC than weekdays).|`|2z4aPm0vaa	Watch out for the area around the capital.

I lived in the area for 8 years and never had a problem.|`|I20mtK1Oaa	I'm actually really surprised at most of these answers.  People who tell you that DC is some scary unsafe place obviously have NEVER been here before.  The Capitol grounds at night?  The safest place you can be in America.  You think someone is going to mug you in front of capitol police officers on every corner?  No.<br>  <br>  Check downtown DC for hotels or near Union Station.  Capitol Hill Suites is nice too and near restaurants, metro, etc.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't suggest staying at the cheap places on New York Ave. NE.  It's pretty hard to get under $100/night though.  Average is $150/night at most places unless you have a discount.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

5VD9fVa1aa	Montreal's best night club strip is along St-Laurent Street, between Shebrooke street and Avenue des Pins.<br>  Second place is St-Denis Street between Sherbrooke Street and Avenue des Pins.<br>  Third is Crescent Street between Maisonneuve Blvd. and Ste-Catherine Streets.<br>  I tend to think of Montreal's bar and night club scene as better for quantity than quality.  Lots of wierd and wonderful places, but none that you will think are the best places you've ever been.  Just keep moving from place to place and you'll have lots of fun.<br>  Montreal is very walkable; it doesn't matter where you stay as long as it's downtown (roughly, Guy street to the west, Sherbrooke street to the north, St-Denis street to the east, and St-Antoine street to the south.  Ste-Catherine Street is always fun to walk down.<br>  <br>  For the morning, it depends what you're into and when you will be there.    Tourist attractions include the Olympic Stadium/Biodome/botanical gardens (Pie IX metro) and Old Montreal (metro Place d'Armes).  In Old Montreal there is the old port, where you can take a St-Lawrence river cruise or do the "Labyrinthe" indoor maze.  The Montreal casino (Jean-Drapeau metro) is open 24/7.|`|xj6CGzSNaa	i like montreal

AA11759382	I stayed there in December and had a mini suite not that i needed a six person dinning room table for my gambling binge.  The only major issue is that the race & sports book is wayyyyyyy back from the main casino.  That can be a problem if you are with other people and you just want to slip in and check scores since it's a long hike.  Other than that, yeah, it's a casino.  I think it's laid out pretty well.  Cocktail service is pretty good.  There is also a walkway to the Paris hotel which is convenient.  Bally's has a better selection of video poker than Paris. It's right in the center of all the major players.  Be sure to get the Total Rewards card and use it when you gamble so you get room discounts or in my case, free rooms.  It's good at Bally's, Paris, Imperial Palace, Flamingo, Caesars Palace and Harrah's.|`|2b7305d1c95ef00f36adb96e6bd2ca68aa	I stayed there some years ago and didn't care for it at all.

The most "action" is at Poipu Beach near the hotels, but I don't think what you are thinking about.  You can take the zodiac (rubber raft) tour of the Na Pali coast from the water, very beautiful with waterfalls that fall into the ocean, sea caves.  You can go torch fishing on the coral reef at night with a flashlight, view the ocean wildlife that comes out (don't put the cone shells down in the palm of your hand, they have a stinger and some are extremely venomous!!).|`|4FvK8XaJaa	Hawaiian Expedition has tips on what to do in Hawaii.

JEMtVVkBaa	I think its just coincidence for the moment.<br>  <br>  But dont forget, there are many more planes in the sky now than there were 10 years ago.<br>  <br>  Airlines are always getting more and more aircraft, and introducing new routes. And if the airlines can not afford the new aircraft, they will keep using the fleet they have more extensively.<br>  <br>  So as I was saying, there are many more planes in the sky, and these planes are also flying more themselves. So naturally, you are going to hear of more crashes.<br>  <br>  The probablility is still ver small.<br>  <br>  but say one in a billion flights were going to crash and kill someone on board. <br>  <br>  in 1999, these one billion flights may have taken 6 months or so; now in 2009, one billion flights are taking only 4 months (i dont know these for facts, its just hypothetical) <br>  <br>  Hudson River was a bird strike, I have not herd anymore on that Dash-8 crash, and initial roumors are that the Turkish Airlines plane may have ran out of fuel - this is backed up by little to no fire after the crash.<br>  <br>  so I think its coincidence|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Coincidence.  Just as with the 2 1/2 year gap of no airplane crashes in the US.|`|bfhsP4GFaa	I was just wondering that, I'm glad someone else brought it up. The three you've mentioned have occurred in the last month alone. On the 26th of January I had a very vivid dream that me and my family were flying to BC, and somehow ended up in a horrific situation when our place crashed into the water of the Carribean. Everyone got out safely.<br>  Two days later, I read an article that on the day I had the dream, the plane crashed into the Hudson River - I thought that to be strange :P<br>  <br>  Anyway, I just read an article on the Amsterdam crash and the captain of Turkish Airlines makes a comment that their planes are getting old but it's too expensive to build new ones right now with the economy. However, the plane that went down was built in 2002, not so old. I also think it has a lot to do with global warming, and the planes are closer to the ozone layer than anything else (although in grade school I swear I learned that planes fly on a level that doesn't have weather?).<br>  <br>  That's my two cents.|`|uZEmRPBFaa	The planes are getting older and the airlines are hesitant to buy new ones because of their past and present economic problems.

xs2mpYjWaa	2 months, won't be long enough, I have rellies that have spent the past 3 years travelling Australia and still haven't seen everything. Australia is the same size as continental USA. <br>  <br>  You can definitely see a good snapshot in 2 months though, I'm not recommending you spend 3 years. May and June would be ok, Australia has relatively mild weather. Start south and work your way up, so start in Melbourne then go to Perth, back over to Sydney then work your way up to Cairns and back over to Darwin. <br>  <br>  South is obviously colder then the north. Darwin you would only visit in June. Darwins tourist season is approx May - August if that broad, they have a wet and dry season and even in winter it still hits 30C+ <br>  <br>  North Queensland is a bit like Hawaii/Oahu weather. Warm all year round, wet/dry seasons, humid, etc.. Down south, Sydney, Perth, Melbourne is more cool and mild with the regular 4 seasons. <br>  <br>  We have a few snow resorts in the moutains in regional NSW and Victoria, besides that it is rare to get snow elsewhere. You shouldn't get much rain anywhere. <br>  <br>  To give you an idea, here's what I would pack. <br>  <br>  Darwin/North Queensland<br>  - shorts<br>  - tshirt<br>  - swimmers<br>  - thongs/flip flops<br>  - walking shoes<br>  - perhaps one thin pair or pants and thin jumper or long sleeve shirt<br>  <br>  Queensland<br>  - Jeans<br>  - tshirt<br>  - long sleeved shirt<br>  - thin jumper for night<br>  - shorts perhaps<br>  <br>  Sydney / Perth<br>  - jeans<br>  - tshirts<br>  - long sleeve tshirts<br>  - long sleeve shirt<br>  - thin jumper<br>  - normal thickness jumper<br>  - thin jacket<br>  <br>  Melbourne <br>  - As above plus another jumper and a slightly thicker jacket... NO SNOW GEAR unless you want to go to the snow. Melbourne is a place you need to layer, you will always have a thin jumper on in the morning and put it on and off through the day. The nights get quite cold by Australian standards. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps you some, don't miss out on the opportunity of a life time because of the weather, it's not severe or harsh by any means.|`|dTiWVBT7aa	Hmmm, yeah mildly. It will be cold and rainy but still some nice days overall. You will need a jumper everyday though (if your american thats a sweater). Our winters are way better than the rest of the world though. Good luck :)|`|s2IOyj8iaa	perfect time for anywhere up North This is the dry season then So Cairns and Darwin will be ideal weather I doubt you will see the country in 2 months you would never stop driving I suggest you leave Sydney and head North to Queensland Getting quite cold at nights down South so you wont want to spend to long down there Once yo get to Brisbane the weather wil just get warmer all the way to cairns Call into Airlie Beach then if you feel like you have time cut across to Darwin then down the centre but don't linger to long once you get to Alice Springs your going back to the cold so you will want to head back to Sydney without hanging around to long in places down South|`|90tPT5nlaa	Start down south in May, which can still be quite nice weather but getting chilly at night, and head north for June.

Jm3vMKx3aa	Yes, you will need a separate visa to visit the United Kingdom. You need to apply for it through the commercial partner of the UK Embassy in Denmark WorldBridge. They will collect the visa fee (560 Kroner), take your biometric data, take your visa application, check it for accuracy and completeness, and forward it to the consular personnel for decision.<br>  The requirements for a tourist visa are outlined on the WorldBridge web page. You should have no problems getting a visa with a proof of authorization to stay in Denmark and a letter of support of your hosting family. It takes between two and ten working days since Europeans do not need visa and only few applications are processed in Denmark (66 tourist visa applications in January 2009).<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/howtoapply/infs/inf2visitors#9275879" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukvisas.gov.uk/en/howtoapply/...</a><br>  <a href="https://www.visainfoservices.com/Pages/Content.aspx?Tag=HowDoIApply_PAGE#VisaFees" rel="nofollow">https://www.visainfoservices.com/Pages/C...</a>

Most NY'ers don't live in Manhattan.|`|KsgdRHfNaa	uhmm well from what you are saying, the actual city city isnt the best place. glendale,middle village, or forest hills are great towns that are not too small and only like 20 min away from manhattan. they are very safe and pretty good rent- good for ny. i have been living in glendale for 10 years and absolutely love it. they have community events at forest park and many activities for anyone all around. my daughter in in dancing school and sings in the church shoir. if you have children, there is plenty to do and the shopping is great by the way too. hop ei helped and good luck =D|`|1d718ff96585004e8d1e8bc312c3655daa	Go to Queens or Brooklyn - Manhattan's overrated.  Not to mention that everyone who lives in Manhattan isn't from New York - they're all transplants from sad little places like Iowa or Wyoming.  Seriously, it's not nearly as glitzy as the movies make it seem - it's crowded, full of annoying tourists, and impossibly to walk/drive/move in.<br>  <br>  The best, safest and most affordable areas in Queens are Forest Hills (love it there - lots of Eastern Europeans and post-Soviet immigrants, but that's probably why it's still safe), Kew Gardens, Rego Park, Sunnyside, Bayside, Astoria and Long Island City.  In Brooklyn, look into Midwood, Bensonhurst, Bay Ridge, Brighton Beach (again, a bunch of Russians, but a good safe area as a result), Seagate (just be careful not to mix up Seagate with Coney Island because Coney Island is nasty) and Flatbush.  Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Park Slope are also REALLY nice but they're all close to Manhattan and their rental prices aren't much lower.|`|4747P6edaa	check out astoria or long island city in queens. both are very close to manhattan and are on good subway lines. these areas are young, and are up and coming areas, so they are still cheap. good luck!|`|gnRiLwSxaa	As far out of New York City as you can get.|`|lZVz8SwBaa	The upper west side in Manhattan.|`|f2NMG2Jjaa	Okay:<br>  <br>  Listen, DO NOT move to Staten Island. I'm serious. <br>  <br>  Upper West, as someone suggested, is okay. I live there, but it's not very youthful, as in activities. Downtown and East side is good.<br>  <br>  Someone else suggested, Queens and Brooklyn....pretty good choices. I LOVE Brooklyn. Like it better than Manhattan. It's so much fun. Different feel than Manhattan, which I like.<br>  <br>  If you choose to live outside Mahattan, that's ok. If you're working in Manhattan, make sure your commute via the subway/car isn't too long.<br>  <br>  Even the Bronx is fine. Okay...it has a terrible rep, but there are some really good parts.<br>  <br>  Where ever you choose, you'll love it. Make sure you can pay the rent(duh). It's an awesome city! The laws are great, too....|`|sKm0sIgBaa	If you mean Manhattan and are afraid of the ghettos your cheapest alternative will probably be the east village or hell's kitchen. If you don't mind living far north you could live in Morningside, Washington heights or Inwood. Inwood and Washington heights are not ghettos per say, but their not the upper east side though.

0ed3a47409dac89fe63086d50549f520aa	Most countries in the world run on capitalistic principles, even social democracies like Sweden. If you are looking for a low-tax country without socialised healthcare and similar programs though, you won't find it in Europe (which is the category where your question is posted). Your best bets would be somewhere like the UK or Switzerland, although both have heavily subsidised social programs.<br>  <br>  I live in Norway, which has very high salaries, but also high taxes. Even with the tax rate, the general population earns more than those in the US with a similar job (after taxes). Most people willingly pay the taxes, because they know they will never have to worry about their own health, retirement, children's (or their own) education, or if they hit hard times.<br>  <br>  If you want less taxes, go to Dubai, especially if you are self-employed and wanting to invest into your own business.|`|AA11021880	Perhaps you should create your own country. Are your taxes really that high? and why are you been selfish only thinking of your self. Paying taxes that give the government money to support those less fortunate is a very good system.<br>  <br>  There are quite a few capitalist country's left in the world the US been one of the worst. Russia and some of its former states are going down a similar path. Although if you want to ern money and never pay taxes you could try some area with no central government then theres no one to tax you.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	China is a Communist country but by all means, head on over there.<br>  <br>  And if you want a country that runs purely on capitalism try Kuwait or Dubai.
DRVSCxKpaa	Australia runs on 240 volts; but more importantly, 50hzs.  A stepper transformer to convert from 110 volts is heavy and expensive (the power point converters only change the plug fitting, not the voltage).<br>  It would be cheaper (and a lot lighter) to buy a portable iron and hair drier when you arrive.<br>  <br>  Better; you may not need one, if you are going to stay in a motel.  Most rooms have a drier and iron; or you can borrow one from the front desk.  The worst case (in backpackers and trailer parks) is that you may have to hire one for a couple of dollars.<br>  <br>  Better still; have a close look at your iron/drier.  They may be dual voltage (with a small switch), or have a built in voltage converter.  You can tell from the specification label on the item - if it says '110 - 220 volts'; you're OK. (Nearly all late model computer power supply and mobile phone chargers are now like this). But you will still need a plug converter which as another answerer noted; you can pick up at an airport, travel centre or even a pharmacy (drugstore).|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	A voltage converter big enough to run an iron or a hair dryer will weigh at least 12 pounds, probably more like 18.  You do not want to be lugging that around with you.<br>  <br>  Most of the 4 and 5 star motels have hairdryers wired in to the mains (so you can't take them with you).  There may be an iron in the room along with the board or you may be able to hire one for a couple of dollars.  Failing that, buy a couple of cheap ones when you get here, but why lug the iron around?  <br>  <br>  There are a lot of small dual voltage applicance around but they are small, low powered things like shavers or phone chargers.  A typical iron or hair drier uses 100 times or more the power these use and making them dual voltage would be difficult (read expensive) or impossible.|`|fa7e17ae5e79327378e35d3394cfed94aa	I would actually just wait until I get to Aussie to get a voltage converter. They're a lot cheaper over there and you can even find them in a grocery store. Just be sure you get the kind that switches between a low voltage and a high voltage. Your flat iron should say the amount that you need on the side of it or even on the box.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	They should all be to Australian standards and most airports have them Hotels have hairdryers and irons in them
JBW34dvqaa	what do you like? there are tons of shops and historical sites... hope u have fun|`|s3hhLQ35aa	I just moved from Charleston and really miss it there.<br>  <br>  There are really a lot of things to do there so you really need to provide some specifics regarding you likes and dislikes.<br>  <br>  For the History buff there is the Yorktown, Fort Moultrie, Fort Sumter, and pretty much all of downtown South of Calhoun Street.<br>  <br>  Dining options are endless.  Charleston has more fine dining per capita than any other US city.  East Bay Street, King Street, Meeting Street are loaded with dining.  Bars too.  I personnally felt that The Charleston Grill was the best in town, but McGrady's is up there too.  For a small intimate restaurant Ile Cotile Del Re is awesome and reasonably priced.<br>  <br>  You should go to waterfront park at the end of Vendue Street.<br>  <br>  Folly Island is a really cool kind of hippyish area.  There are some fun bars out there.<br>  <br>  Boating and fishing in Charleston are to die for.  If you are in to that kind of thing you can rent a boat over at Patriots Point in Mount Pleasant.  Plus, that gives you the opportunity to cross the Ravenel Bridge.<br>  <br>  There are several plantations in the West Ashley area and in Mount Pleasant.  They are pretty nice.<br>  <br>  Before I moved I took a horse carriage tour downtown.  I highly recommend it.<br>  <br>  Ghost Walks are cool to.  Just do a internet search before you go to book a ticket.  A good one leaves from the Griffon on Vendue Street.<br>  <br>  There are many many more things to do.
AA10250939	Interesting question. I doubt that many people on this site will be able to give you an answer than you could come up with yourself.  It seems that you are very "well connected" but are a bit ambivalent to exploit your connections.  I believe that if you want to be a business owner (a gallery, afterall is a business) that you need to be very comfortable in being able to do whatever it takes to get it up & running & then sustainable.  Afterall, it is will be your brainchild...and you have to ensure that it flourishes.  Your connections may give you a hand-up, but it will be your talent that ultimately sustains the gallery.  Best wishes to you!|`|1be40c12a77f6c00d5dfd80e2c986569aa	well if you really worked where you said, you would know the answer.  Obviously you do not know much about the industry.<br>  <br>  so, to answer your question, you will fail|`|AA11071860	Not now. Art is suffering from economy malaise. Very few are willing to buy artwork given the economic situation. Work in an art gallery, plenty on the East side of 57th Street and Tribeca but all are ungoing economic mletdown.|`|41ERg1Gvaa	This question does not make sense.  Do you want to make a good living with your experience and connections, as stated in the first paragraph, or do you not want help from your connections, as stated in the second paragraph? You can't have it both ways.<br>  Art dealer is a sales job -- like any other, it's all about making personal connections.  As for whether your personal network is or will be strong enough to support your own gallery -- ask your network, not strangers!

There is a beach, two pools, volleyball courts, tennis courts, a lot of walking trails, boats to rent, horseback riding, bicycles to rent, fishing, a Segway tour and a small arcade.  There are also carriage rides and wagon rides in the evening.<br>  <br>  Wi-Fi is available but it costs $4.99 per hour or $9.95 for 24 hours.<br>  <br>  It might just be me... but the campgrounds are fun and a much cheaper way to go to Disney than paying for a hotel.  Try not to act negative about it.  Your mom is taking not only you, but allowing friends to come along.

They said there is a ton of stuff there and it's a blast.  PLUS, you save money camping as opposed to staying in the hotels.<br>  <br>  I don't know that they have wifi, but they do have internet connectivity for a fee (you'll have to contact Disney to find out what the fee is).

XQDDttvEaa	The Tryst or the Tao.
Mxr6AIkiaa	No. Or perhaps I should say maybe.<br>  <br>  They won't carry a two year old that they know or even believe is two for free. You could claim he's not yet two. They could (and likely will unless he's very small) ask for his birth certificate.

Sorry you have to pay for the seat.|`|xIHgTqVhaa	I'm a former Flight Attendant and the airlines are strict about the age 2 rule. Some foreign airlines will let babies over age 2 to sit on laps for the return portion of a round-trip within a certain amount of time. I don't know the details because the FAA dictates that once the second birthday is reached, the child must have his or her own seat. <br>  <br>  Airlines get in trouble and are fined if they break FAA regulations. As a result, many airlines ask for certified copies of children's birth certificates for domestic travel. For international flights, they will check the passport.  It's up to the parent to prove that the child is under age 2 so you would have to do something really dishonest, like use a false birth certificate. <br>  <br>  We once had a delay because of a child who was over age 2. The mother was confused and didn't speak English. Another mother wrote me to tell me she bought her ticket on line, not realizing the under-2 rule and she and her 26 month old daughter were removed from the flight. If this happens, you will be charged the full fare one-way flight, which can be expensive. The mother opted to rent a car and drive home instead, since the fare was too pricey.<br>  <br>  Children are safer in their own seats as well as more comfortable. Causing a delay or trying to get away with this may not be in your best interest. Shop around on line, through airline websites and with agents to find the best price. Also, if you're flexible with dates, you may be surprised how much money you'll save moving a day forward or back. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

There's really no reason for it, its just the way things are.|`|kJkKx5J5aa	My Korean teacher told me there used to be a slight difference in pronunciation between these vowels, but that only the older generation really pays attention to that.

You need proof of Southern California residency or you will be treated as if you live in another state, or live in another country.<br>  <br>  You could try to just show the tickets if you purchased them in advance. Because from what I've heard, the Cast Members monitoring the entry turnstiles have been very lazy about checking ID with the 2Fer tickets. But if you intend to buy your tickets at the main entrance, you'll be out of luck, The ticket window people are very strict about requiring ID which shows proof of Southern Calif. residency|`|6Gfz125Paa	Matricula Consulars don't show your address, so no, you can't.<br>  <br>  You can use a utility bill I believe.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	No, the point is that it's for CA residents only.|`|cK28Kl0Uaa	I think you can get the same tickets at Vons and you wouldn't be required to show id then.

AA11822515	Tokyo is a wonderful city, certainly a lot more interesting than London. <br>  Its a very safe place, as is all of Japan. <br>  <br>  Most Japanese people of your age will know a certain amount of English. It would be advisable to learn some basic Japanese before you travel though - it's not as hard as you might think. Most Japanese will actually jump at the chance to practice their English with you.<br>  <br>  The city is huge and vastly populated, but it's served by the most efficient public transport system in the world. You're never more than 500 metres from a train or subway station. <br>  <br>  Of course it depends on what you mean by 'the real Japan'. Tokyo ranges from the ultra - modern to the very traditional. Mount Fuji is only 40 miles (70km) to the south. There are lots of other very interesting places close by, beyond the city limits of Tokyo. There is a lifetime of things to see and experience within two hours travel of the city centre.<br>  <br>  $2,500 would be a minimum including your air fare, if I was you. Tokyo is the fourth most expensive city in the world, but this is all relative in terms of wages, etc. You can spend hundreds of dollars a night on hotels, but there are always much cheaper alternatives, such as ryokans - traditional Japanese inns - which will set you back a lot less. The same goes for food and transport. If you're looking for a cheaper, more real experience, it's worthwhile staying outside of the main city centre. Go for areas like Asakusa, Meguro, Ueno or Ikebukuro.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|jR8mclWIaa	Wait till you are older and have more money.|`|1iXvphNYaa	That's the beauty of it. Feel your way around.

When you get off the plane, you go downstairs. There's a section blocked off, for the Disney Magical Express. You go in the line with the hotel name that's yours. Then, you board the bus, and it takes you directly to your hotel. The luggage is taken off the plane, put inside the Magical Express Bus, and you have no worries about your luggage. Just remember to put the yellow tags on the luggage, and it will definitly be put in with the other luggage. As you arrive your hotel, and go into your room, your luggage may possibly already be in your room, or it will be in up to 3 hours after, depending on various things. Southwest Airlines can do about anything. They get the luggage off the plane and send it to the Disney Magical Express:)<br>  <br>  I use southwest everytime, because of the nonstop flights, and the quick luggage service! You have nothing to worry about!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|6SlpdRSbaa	when you depart from your disney resort on departure date, you are not able to check-in your luggage at the resort.  only airlines such as ...American and United allows you to check-in your luggage at the disney resort.<br>  **but when you arrive at the Orlando airport on your arrival date Disney will pick up your luggage and take them to your disney room (make sure the yellow tags are placed on every luggage piece).

The red light district is always fun to walk through at night. For most tourists it's alot about the girls and looking inside, but I just like how pretty the canals look when they're lit up. There also a number of monuments, statues and buildings spread out, that although not worth a trip in themselves are fun to see while you walk. You could also check out the street art scene.

Education is a powerful tool to help you overcome your fears.  I definitely recommend checking out the website.  :)|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	1 you have a bigger chance of being in a car wreck<br>  <br>  it's not scary, it's like a free fall for a split second..  so yeah, your stomach goes into your chest and you get startled and wide eyes, but then everything goes back to normal.. no biggie.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	You have a very very slim chance of crashing.

7Xiz8iwPaa	SF has a great variety of boutique store with very unique graphic tees. Upper Playground is all right, but you can buy that online, and their tees aren't that nice looking.

Although it really saddens me to see that you've got too limited a knowledge about Africa, starvation, AIDS and terrosits ... probably from expensive X-Box game, it encourages me that there are very few people with low IQ's, like you, that will believe you.<br>  <br>  To answer the question, Ethiopia is a country in the horn of Africa. It's not economically developed, but has had a strong economic growth of 10+% for the past six consecutive years.<br>  <br>  Addis Ababa is our capital. It's a very large city. It's got all the modern facilities you would need ina ny other country. From Luxury hotels to the lowest B&B, Addis Ababa caters to everyone with respect to his or her pocket. <br>  <br>  Crime is virtually non-existent, although there are pick-pockets that take advantage of lazy moments. Foreigners are treated with respect.And nobody would attack you. We are a very cultural society and have respect for people no matter what their race, creed religion or nationality. After all more than 80 ethnic groups live in Ethiopia. Do you thin we would have survived a three-thousand year long history if we had killed eachother?<br>  <br>  Transportation, expecially air, is available to almost all corners of the country. Ethiopian Airlines (EST. 1946) is one of the leading airlines on the continent.<br>  <br>  Tempratures vary from hot (Dalol is the one of the hottest place on the globe) to European freezing conditions in the highlands, so come with shorts AND Parkas.<br>  <br>  This is all off the top of my head. And I'm sure you'll get more information if you Google it and/or correspnd with tourists or expats who have been here or are still here.<br>  <br>  I read this article yesterday, and it really touched me.

Qtys8AiTaa	I think potentially it is a fantastic idea. There are many arrangements/common borders type rules between countries which are completely separate  government entities. US - Canada and Ireland and the UK are the two biggest examples. <br>  <br>  My understanding is that immigration - and at some point even possibly customs - could be done at the point of departure. Info is already shared between the countries on many issues btw. So, thinking about it practically, you get all the 'procedural' stuff sorted in NZ (or Australia) then you get to simply jump on an aeroplane and walk off at the end. The possibility of even arriving at a domestic terminal (often less busy) or a terminal which doesn't require extra customs and immigration staff are endless. <br>  <br>  At this stage, my understanding is that the customs procedures for biosecurity would still be done but long term even this could be done at the point of departure.  I think it's got potential to be a great idea.|`|AA11128932	I can remember 30 yrs ago when you didnt need a passport <br>  to travel between the 2 countries !!|`|AA10544698	Only when NZ and Australia unite.<br>  They are separate countries so by definition international travel.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Can't see why we need passports to go back & forward. lol, haven't forgotten 'Rabbits' Warren didn't update his & couldn't go over to do the footy broadcast.

1GIzl88kaa	Make sure you visit if you've never been there. It's a beautiful place to visit, but a major shock when you've been living in the north. Believe me, I know - I moved from Florida to Pennsylvania, and it took me a long time to get used to it!|`|g05wGcPhaa	If you have a job here waiting for you then by all means come but if not then it makes no sense moving here. Port St. Lucie has a really low crime rate. The city is a generally nice place. A friend of mine lives there and I visit her oh so often. Even though the city has been around for a while it's relatively new. <br>  <br>  The unemployment rate right now in South Florida has reached 8.1% since December 08, higher than the national unemployment rate of 7.6%. As of right now it's nearly impossible to find a job in most parts of South Florida especially the Tri-County area (Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade). As of February 2009 in Port St. Lucie the unemployment level was at 10.5 percent and in 2008, nearly 11,000 homes went into foreclosure. Most companies are cutting jobs right now so it's going to be quite hard for you to find a job because now you have to compete with a whole bunch of people who probably want the same position and who have been waiting months just for a job to come by.<br>  <br>  Recently Miami Dade County was hiring 35 Firefighters. More than a thousand (1,000) literally waited and camped out just to get that job. Out of those 1,000+ only 35 of them got the job.<br>  <br>  In Davie there was a job fair going. Hundreds of job seekers hoping to get into the job fair to talk to about three dozen employers were waiting in a line that stretched around the block and across a parking lot. Now thats some serious stuff. That's how bad thing are right now.<br>  <br>  To get to the point. South Florida is a mess. If you think you have the time and money and a job to move here then go ahead.|`|A7cWzCmpaa	oh my goodness talk about a hole in the wall.  that place is awful looks like a small town for losers sorry that was my impression.  i would never live there
4VY7u6tNaa	sorry crazygirl, not fully getting your question. You state: "People go off and buy cheap drink in the off licence instead of going to the pub early", yet you then state "If drink were cheaper, people would not feel the need to drink at home. They would have controlled portions"......Like, if its cheap in the offie, why would you want it cheaper? Maybe are you referring to the likes of Aldi etc?<br>  Although, confusion aside, recession times are here, and even before that, taxes were hell bent on loosing our "drinking epidemic", hence even the Vitners backing the pubs. Crippling taxes and constant hikes in drink prices, began to close many pubs down, and families put out of work. No joke, a bottle of miller in a pub can be anything up to a fiver, yet you can buy 24 bottles in dunnes for 20 quid..... but again, thats no fault of the pub (to a degree), they need to make a living too. Its a business, not a charity. Binge drinkers are early teens to early 20's (so the news tells us), these guys ain't got the funds for a bog standard night in the pub, plus, I genuinely don't think they're interested in sitting in a pub for too long. High prices in pubs cause binge drinking? No, I don't think so, I think the opposite, its the cheap booze in shops etc that tempt one to binge. Maybe the high prices have just filtered out the riff raff, and ordinary joe soaps like myself, who would have to save for a month to get out for one night! Hence the bottle of vino by the fire!! I don't think the youth are educated enough about the harms of drinking, and lack of confidence (booze giving them false confidence) towards them to binge drink. Plus, they aint able to socially drink, its like group boozing and god knows what else.|`|373267de54a567ce4fdd303d84705891aa	i think if people want to get drunk then they will...you can binge drink in pubs if you want, ive been out with lads who down their pints to see who can finish it faster, along with taking shots of tequila etc.. So making the pubs cheaper would just increase that. Controlled portions dont really help when you balance it out by drinking more.<br>  Also some girls like to drink when theyre getting ready to go out, so that wouldnt stop either whatever the prices from the offy were.<br>  <br>  so i dont think legislation or prices are the problem, its the people who want to get drunk cos they think theyll have a better night. To stop binge drinking you'd have to change those attitudes first.|`|jVCudNcBaa	totally know where ur coming from! but places like france etc open 24 hours dont have a big of a problem like we do! we should try it and see how it goes at least we dont need to feel to get drunk before the bar closes|`|tGGVeW3yaa	To long to read so i'm just going to disagree with ye

There may be faster or slower services; I didn't spend a lot of time checking.<br>  <br>  The second link takes you to the journey search page. (BTW, searching for the trains I'd need to catch to get from Fiumicino to Firenze didn't work for me.

7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	There are many seaports in HK but I think what you means is the Macau HK Ferry Terminal and the China HK Ferry Terminal. For Macau HK Ferry Terminal, there is a subway stn called Sheung Wan which is the first stn on the Island line. The fares defers and for more info, visit <a href="http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/homepage/cust_index.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/homepage/cust_...</a> As for another one, you have to take a taxi to Kowloon Stn for approx HK$16-20 or walk about 10-15 min to Tsim Sha Tsui or Jordan Station. For getting to major tourist attraction, it depends on where you are going, so its hard to tell. But on average, if for going to Disneyland, it can cost you approx HK$200 from HK China and HK$250-300 from Macau-HK. It will be cheaper for other attractions, but crossing over from HK Island side to Kowloon side vice versa or crossing tunnels anywhere, there will be toll charges, ranging from HK$5-45 per crossing, so it will add up if you use those. Other surcharge also applies, like call charge if book advance and excess lugguage surchage etc.|`|ZtPdNnIZaa	what do u mean seaport? do u mean a cruise ship pier? if so, our only cruise ship pier = the Ocean Terminal. which linked w/ the largest shopping mall in HK.  <a href="http://www.harbourcity.com.hk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.harbourcity.com.hk/</a><br>  <br>  n it's aldy in the heart of the city....so u dun hv to taxi there. the terminal is located in Tsim Sha Tsui. which u can enjoy the stunning view of our Victoria Harbour here. u may try the Star Ferry to cross the harbour which just takes u about HK$3 per boat trip. <br>  <a href="http://www.starferry.com.hk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.starferry.com.hk/</a><br>  <br>  if u r going to HK side (the tourist's spot over that side).... take the ferry 1st & shift a taxi cross the harbour. that wil be a lot cheaper if u direct hop onto a taxi in TST as u hv to jam across the harbour. we hv cross harbour tunnel of cos. <br>  <br>  on HK side....tourist's spot.... mainly we hv the Peak & the Stanley Market. fr the Star Ferry HK pier --> taxi to the Peak tram station wil be about HK$30. if to the Stanley... abt HK$120. <br>  <a href="http://www.thepeak.com.hk/full/en/peak_tram.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thepeak.com.hk/full/en/peak_t...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hk-stanley-market.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hk-stanley-market.com/</a><br>  <br>  Kowloon side (which TST located there)... we hv Ladies Street Market.... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies'_Street" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies'_Str...</a><br>  which opened 2pm to midnite daily. full of hawkers... very local shopping ut fun!<br>  <br>  if u hv enuf time... can visit the Giant Buddha... <br>  <a href="http://www.np360.com.hk/html/eng/front/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.np360.com.hk/html/eng/front/i...</a><br>  it's a stunning spot that u should definately try. just take MTR (our underground) towards the Tung Chung Terminal. abt HK$25 per head. dun taxi as it's such a long way.... that wil be abt HK$300. <br>  <a href="http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/train/system_map.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtr.com.hk/eng/train/system_m...</a><br>  u can easily walk to the TST station fr seaport (abt 3-4 mins walk) and take the train all the way to Tung Chung Terminal. after u arvd there... walk 1 min to the cable car station... the cabe car wil takes u 25 mins to travel to buddha. <br>  <br>  n at that Tung Chung station... u can also visit the 1 & the only 1 outlets mall in HK. <a href="http://www.citygateoutlets.com.hk/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.citygateoutlets.com.hk/index....</a>|`|SeJ1Hnfraa	On average $60each taxi ride<br>  First 2 kilometres or any part thereof $ 18 <br>  Every subsequent 200 metres or part thereof / <br>  Every period of 1 minute waiting time or part thereof <br>        For meter fare below $70.5 <br>       For meter fare of $70.5 and above<br>  Additional Charges   <br>  Every baggage (except light personal hand baggage carried inside vehicle compartment) $ 5  <br>  Wheelchairs and crutches carried by disabled passengers Free  <br>  Every animal or bird $ 5  <br>  Every hiring arranged through telephone booking $ 5|`|cUhcsEcGaa	Sorry, joul<br>  i have no knowledge of this question. pl. don't mind.<br>  thanks

vgNELAQIaa	Elizabeth said that less than 20 aboriginal languages remain strong. That is not true. I live in the Northern Territory of Australia where there are over 40 different aboriginal languages and they are the first language of the NT aborigines. Other people answering in this thread say that only older people maintain the language, again, this is not true. There are many young aborigines here who speak almost no English, but speak as many as 4 or 5 different aboriginal languages fluently.<br>  As for becoming a dead language, that would be true in areas like Sydney and Melbourne where through modern population and culture, some of those languages no longer exist. However, here in the NT and also in WA, the aboriginal language for many tribes remains strong with little or no risk of it becoming extinct.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	There are different dialects I would think. As Australia is an English speaking country it is only to be expected that they will have that as their first language because of education & job opportunities etc. Some of the older ones still speak their own language exclusively.|`|Fnp2MIycaa	None of our Indigenous tribes had a written language. <br>  If spoken language isn't used regularly it dies.<br>  Some Indigenous people have never heard their tribal language and yet others have it as their first language. <br>  It depends on who they are and where in Australia they're from and if the Elders are committed to keeping it alive.<br>  <br>  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Languages.<br>  <br>  There are more than 200 Australian Indigenous languages. Less than 20 languages are strong, and even these are endangered: the others have been destroyed, live in the memories of the elderly, or are being revived by their communities. This site has annotated links to 231 resources for about 80 languages. About 35% of these resources are produced or published by Indigenous people.|`|gAOAdOHraa	There are over 200 Australian Indigenous languages.  Jaru, Tiwi, Yaegl are just a few.

3K1QW7Oeaa	You get what you pay for! ^_^|`|ZacGbxZDaa	Oregon is the best state in America!!<br>  <br>  oh yeah, and there are no hippies there lol.|`|QEYzTriUaa	Oregon is a historically blue state, and is known to be fairly liberal in both politics and lifestyle. Portland is considered one of (if not THE) greenest metropolis in the country, and is concerned with recycling, sustainability, and conservation. Although it is not particularly ethnically diverse, Portland is known to be very accepting of all sexualities, religions, and political groups. It is easy to find great vegan or vegetarian restaurants, as well as fresh local produce and some fantastic wines, especially Pinot Noirs from the Willamette Valley. Oregon also has the highest number of microbreweries per capita than anywhere else in the US, so there are a plethora of interesting beers to try. Besides, there's no sales tax in Oregon, just steeper income tax. <br>  The air is wonderful-- all of the evergreens and vegetation allow for crisp, generally unpolluted air. I go to school in Los Angeles, and every time I go home, just breathing makes me feel healthier. <br>  Overall, Oregon offers beautiful landscape, open-minded people, and a genuine concern for the earth, and I'm proud to call it home. If you want to get an instant portrait of the real Portland, visit the Saturday Market. It epitomizes the city and introduces you to the P-town vibe!!|`|xwAp9faZaa	Portland  is just like any other large US town, you have awesome people and then you have druggies. If you stay in the down town and suburbia then you will find mostly awesome people.<br>  Oregonians love nature (for the most part) and try to integrate it into their daily lives. All of the cities have parks and many have water of some sort. The air in most places is amazingly fresh, especially near the ocean. Even in Portland the air is much better than you would think.<br>  I moved to Oregon from Washington and loved it. The people are a lot friendlier and the weather is milder. Even in the huge cities you have a very small town feel. If you have the opportunity, go to Oregon.
s2IOyj8iaa	Im Wellington born and bred. I don't wish to live there now as I've been lucky enough to have the choice and have chosen Australia for its weather but having been back recently I noticed such a lot that I used to take for granted. Examples are Lush green bush trees and gardens. Trendy Boutique shops. An incredible botanical gardens after the ride in the cable car and getting views of Wellington and its harbour then the walk through the gardens i realised what a paradise Wellington is rather unique nestled below the very green hills. I walked into a supermarket and found the most delicous takeaway foods I was so spoilt for choice. Mind you Wellington can also be very bleak and Cold on a windy wet day and they get plenty of that. Auckland I have lived North Auckland is very pleasant but South Auckland I never care to go again. Christchurch some love it but I have never taken to it. I have lived in Dunedin Thats a pleasant scottish and student sort of city but oh so cold at times.

2ac2Ecxoaa	Well, to say that there was never any rivalry is slightly inaccurate. When the English settled in Ireland there was obviously some conflict between the native Irish and the English Settlers. If there was no rivalry between the two countries then the Irish would have accepted the English people quietly which clearly did not happen. The Troubles in NI are a perfect example of both Anti-British and Anti-Irish views.<br>  <br>  Nowadays things are a lot better but of course (especially in Northern Ireland) there remains conflicts between these views, although it is a lot less obvious there are still divisions in some communities. For the most part there are no negative feelings but there a still some people with Anti-Irish and Anti-British views.|`|reHRXlZCaa	No, some people persist with the myth but it's not true, it would be far more truthful to say we have a complex relationship based on geographical & historical ties.  Historically, Irish people living in the UK did have difficulties but we are one of the largest groups of immigrants in the UK and there are large numbers of British citizens living in the Republic of Ireland, the situation would quickly become intolerable if there was any enmity.|`|XPqRthwraa	The english and irish in some respecgts are classed as one.

A7cWzCmpaa	dont listen to suspendy she seems bitter and there is no wrong type of American dream,  you go for what you want not what suspendy thinks is the right dream!  geez some people really need a life.  anyways i have lived in sobe for over 14 years and if changes ever so many years.  right now everyone is tight because tourism is down and hotels which are a big employer on the beach are laying off people.  we get several events every year which are annoying, memorial day weekend is a living nightmare, hip hop takes over the beach, cops close a lot of streets and cops are everywhere, noise is at its highest.  then there is spring break within the last few years it has become a destination for young college kids and they too are annoying since they come and cause trouble but spend very little like the memorial day crowd.  the summer is brutal since it is hot and all the europeans are gone, trust me they are the ones that give this area flavor and they bring lots of money with them to keep all our local shops and rest. open.  sobe is unique since all kinds you can imagine are here.  traffic is no problem for me since i jump on the shuttle for a quarter and go anywhere.  if you have a car i feel for you, parking is very difficult.  but if you get a job on the beach you dont need a car at all.  yes there are a lot of immigrants but they have never bothered me, they seem to work hard and mind there own business.  they do like to ride their bikes on the sidewalks which annoys but whatever.  the beach is awesome i never tire of walking over there and going in the water in the summer.  it is not for everyone and i am the only person in my family that likes it.  i cant stand suburbs and the mundane life that it brings so for me it is perfect.  do know that some nights i see huge fights but at this point it is mostly amusing.  i go to bed everynight with the music of the clubs but i have gotten used to it.|`|t4F59gf2aa	mostly desperate wannabes and immigrants chasing the wrong type of American dream.|`|jDbuHPBeaa	Traffic is annoying, but overall Its a great place to live.<br>  I wouldn't trade it for anywhere else.
Q3RqWHFsaa	Japanese text is usually based on Kanji and Hiragana. The article each has so many particles in Japanese.<br>  <br>  Kanji can't be particle but Hiragana can. Verb, adjective, adverb as each independent word usually its Kanji root and its Hiragana suffix too.<br>  <br>  Some long text may have comma(s) after the end of each sentence for better recognition to each phrases too.<br>  <br>  People understanding or getting accustomed those Japanese peculiarity can recognize the boundaries automatically in the context without fail.<br>  <br>  Don't try to perceive the article only by Hiragana. Combination of Kanji and Hiragana including the usage of particles all together are essential key factor to learne basic Japanese at first.<br>  <br>  From another view point, don't use space for Japanese reading or writing, it becomes just obstacle to learn it in a sense. Japanese is not a part of English.|`|KwUfhcmwaa	Often words are connected with He, No, To, Ni, Ga, Wa etc...

ZmlNMWXBaa	Ok well the bus station is right next to Skid Row (homeless population) and LAX is in the other side of town.  So what you want to do is look up hostels or cheap hotels near the red line (metro) stops check out this website <a href="http://www.metro.net/default.asp." rel="nofollow">http://www.metro.net/default.asp.</a>  With $5 get an all day pass and you can jump on any bus or metro station in L.A county.  If you're visiting for a day I recommend you do just that.  Go to Olivera Street, visit the Los Angeles Cathedral, hollywood & highland and Universal Citywalk.  They are all free sight seeing things to do and they can be done just by jumping on the red line and all for $5!  While you're sight seeing on the red line look at one of the maps that are located in all stations and it will show you how you can take the red line to LAX.  <br>  <br>  Oh when you arrive to the greyhound station, Olivera Street is not that far like 10 minutes by car and right next to Olivera is Chinatown :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and have a good day sight seeing.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Check out hostelsusa.com.

7Wz3ZOnNaa	The strange thing in Japan is students can freely sleep in class.  At any one time I can expect 2 or 3 kids to have their heads down.  Some are actually sleepy but most are just opting out of learning.  The trouble makers don't cause trouble... they just go to sleep.<br>  <br>  I suppose a Japanese teacher think it best to teach 39 kids and have 1 sleeper than hold up 39 kids for the sake of waking 1 sleeper.<br>  <br>  If a student doesn't do their homework then they don't get their homework book stamped.|`|55ef67a1ec3f06e6f365e48d4a54535faa	All the teachers in Japan must follow the rules set by the Ministry of Education (Japanese government).<br>  If they don't, they get fired.|`|vS80xcoHaa	area52 is correct. This is an unfortunate reality because all teachers teach the same thing. This means that all Japanese children are taught (ie, indoctrinated)  the same way and it leads to 'group think' and it prevents individualism.|`|63ERCghTaa	they spank you with a yard stick if you don't do good. LOL jk.<br>  but yea, I've been to tokyo like so many times already. Born in the states but never attended school in Japan. (btw, i'm japanese) They will probably let ya sleep through out the class. Not much trouble makers in schools. They'd rather sleep in class then get in trouble for their actions. Teachers don't really care if ya sleep, well as long if its not over 1/4 or 1/2 of the class sleeping. They're just there to get paid, haha.|`|6wAJJxWwaa	The students know that if they don't do their homework, the teachers will send ninjas after them. Japanese live in fear of ninjas.

9d3be230d13c2c6c195cc79113b4da0aaa	It does not work like that, yes you can buy miles for that much money but you need to check the carriers web site for award flights using miles.  An example is on Northwest airlines you would need 75,000 miles accumulated to trade in for an award ticket.  Domestic flights are 25,000 - 30,000.  About the only thing you can do with 5000 miles is possibly upgrade to first class.|`|GEDE2td7aa	What airline are you looking at? That may SEEM cheap, but there is a catch. The airlines don't calculate the miles to get somewhere like that. For example, I'm flying across the US for 32,500 skymiles. It is definitely not 32,500 to get me across the US, but that is what they charge.<br>  <br>  Japan is 5000 miles away from you? Well, Russia is about the same for me. And to get to Russia, it'll cost about 100,000-150,000 skymiles (on Delta) to get me there for free.<br>  <br>  Buying skymiles comes in handy only when you need a small amount. Say you needed ONLY 1,000 more skymiles to get somewhere, that's a cheap ticket. Get it? Hope that helps you out...Also, check out the airline's mall, most have a site where you can buy from common sites online and get miles for them. I bought a book online for $8 and got 4 skymiles per dollar spent. Easy way to earn miles. It all depends......

3vNecJ2waa	You have answered your own question as I would have.  You want the snow boarding you would do best near Whistler or Banff, Alberta.  Banff is near Calgary, so there is a nearby city.  Cold it can be, so golfing season is shorter.  <br>   Same goes with Maritimes, long winter, but fewer great slopes.  Fewer people in some of the areas also.  <br>   You want to really get secluded, try Newfoundland.  Marble Mountain, near Corner Brook is great.  No big cities nearby though, and you are on an island that requires a ferry to get your vehicle to. But, you will have the cold and snow.  Piloting would make this a little easier.<br>   Hard to beat the Whistler area, though.  Grouse Mountain or Cypress are both great for fresh snowfall.  It is real easy to find better weather down the mountain for the golfing, but gets quite populated around Vancouver.  I prefer Nanaimo, on the East shore of Vancouver Island.  It is a short ferry ride, but there are a lot of golfing days in this area.|`|V8yR8BU1aa	Canmore, AB, Anywhere near Pentiction or Kelowna C...

Like maybe Nanaimo, Comox, or Courtnay. Mt. Washington is close to all these cities, if you want to snowboard. And Whistler is about a ferry ride and a drive away. However, Vancouver Island doesn't get very cold but it snows sometimes. However, it is very nature-y. There is a lot of nature to see there. And there is a lot of scenic plane tours on the island. There also seems to be a variety of golf courses on the island.|`|2WxxStXIaa	Broad daylights shootings.<br>  <br>  Break-ins and MS 13 (Most dangerous gang in the world)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Vancouver is now...<br>  <br>  The Gang Capital of North America.<br>  <br>  ... and fast becoming worst...<br>  <br>  MS13 is now right on your son's and daughter's doorsteps.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Alberta..., maybe Vancouver, BC|`|MIqdsUdnaa	You might want to have a look at Calgary, Alberta.  It's pretty much as you described, with ski hills and golf and breathtaking mountain views. There's hiking, camping, fishing, mountain biking, the Stampede, festivals, theater, concerts and pretty much anything else you could want.  I live in a rural area about twenty minutes outside of the Calgary city limits.  It's right on a wildlife corridor with a full view of the Rocky Mountains.  I'm close enough to the city for shopping, movies, restaurants, libraries and gyms, but far enough to be out of the crunch of the city. Whistler is okay, but it's a tourist town, so it's overly trendy, expensive and seasonal.

AA10717577	With a family I would choose to move out of the city and go to the suburbs..there are some good buys all over MA right now as everywhere in the country....keep in mind that there is a commuter rail that goes all the way out to worcester into Boston - so if Boston is just for work consider the communities outside the city....plays, museums, playgroups and all can still be found in the suburbs.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Newton, Chestnut Hill, Jamaica Plain, Brookline (expensive here), Needham, Weymouth are some nicer areas!|`|BRXg8Mcpaa	If you don't want to live downtown, then the North End and Beacon Hill aren't for you.  They're nice for sure, but packed full of people, busy as hell and parking is an absolute nightmare.  <br>  <br>  The suburbs are lovely - Cambridge is my personal favorite.  It's on the best T line (the Red Line) and is home to harvard University, MIT and countless streets lined with Victorian houses and lots of trees.  Not to mention the school system is awesome and it is VERY safe.  <br>  <br>  Brookline and Brighton are busy and pretty much full of students.  The public transportation is perfect (most of those areas are right on the Green Line), but if you own a car you're pretty much screwed.  <br>  <br>  Further out of the city you can look at places like Jamaica Plain that are still low cost and very safe places to raise a family.|`|TAjtr6otaa	There are many areas around Boston which are great for all the things you're looking for. Some of these towns however are very expensive to live in, but are great for everything else. Brookline, Newton, and Wellesley are all near one another and very safe with excellent schools.<br>  Towns which are great for everything, and a little less expensive for housing are places like Cambridge.|`|zFOC0PZnaa	Sorry if a lot of these things have already been mentioned. I was too lazy to read all the answers. :P Good call on the Downtown thing. It's pretty sketchy over there right now. If you're willing to spend a lot of money, Beacon Hill and Back Bay are the nicest neighborhoods. But they're wicked expensive. Places to avoid are Roxbury, Dorchester, Mattapan. Most of West Roxbury and JP are okay, but there are definitely some rougher neighborhoods there too. And all of these places are in Boston city limits, so you have to deal with school if you have kids- the public schools are awful.  My advice would be to choose an urban/suburban town. I know that sounds totally contradictory, but it's the best way to describe it. Take Brookline. It's surrounded on 3 sides by Boston with 2 T (subway/trolley) lines connecting it to the city plus a number of bus routes. It's virtually part of the city of Boston. However, it's got MUCH better schools, and a totally different set (some would say better) set of laws and codes.  So you have the combination of accessibility and good standard of living- what's not to like? Newton is a similar town, though that tends to be pricier.  Good luck, and have fun in Boston!|`|W2JUHdSfaa	Brookline is good for education and all that. A generally nice place to live. If I were you I'd check out the Condos there, theyre better deals than houses. Also Cambridge, Harvard Square, is a really wonderful place to live.|`|Z7MHvO8kaa	I disagree on most of all the areas suggested you want to live in about a 15 mile radius of boston like melrose lynnfield north reading wakefield was were i grew up nice neighborhoods, decent public transportation low crime good schools friendly people|`|Q0J5rjU6aa	Living in or near the city is expensive.  Brookline and Newton are very nice communities near Boston, but very expensive.  STAY AWAY from Mattapan, Roxbury, Jamaica Plain, Dorchester.  <br>  <br>  Arlington, which is a little north of Boston, is a nice city and has public transportation.  South of Boston, Quincy is a small city with some nice areas and access to public transportation.|`|U7Ao0bRdaa	Look Around the town of Winthrop, Nice small town Borders East Boston (boston) surronded by water, Very close to the city but a nice place to raise a family.

Drnpe4T5aa	If you love the outdoors and hiking, check out Cinque Terre - it is 5 cities, all connected by footpaths.  The are almost completely without vehicles, though a train goes through.

Andrea Palladio was a famous italian architect and alot of his villas can be seen in Vicenza.  Some other interesting places in the north in addition to the ones you mentioned are Lake Garde ( Verona) - which is a beautiful lake that stretches into Germany.  George Clooney has a house there !!!!  Also in the same area you have Sirmione and Peschiera - both very quaint places.  Liguria is great with Cinque Terre, which is 5 small villages all interconnected by a small train system.  I wouldn't go to Bari - I, personally, did not think there was much there.  The Amalfi coast, I'm sure, is beautiful with the cities of Positano, Portofino too.....|`|Yi0sksmJaa	Turin is beautiful. I love Genoa too. My friend and her family have a place in a little town called Santa Margarita (spelling?) it's near Genoa. Beautiful. Also, you won't be too far from Pisa and Luca if you're on that coast. Venice is really neat and the weather shouldn't be too horrible at that time of year. (When it gets really hot Venice can get a little smelly from the water.) Lake Como is beautiful too. If you feel like a long day trip check out Lugano, Switzerland. It's gorgeous. Have fun on your trip!!|`|8LXMdnbCaa	tuscany and florence, very very good<br>  venice is ok (yes, water smells not good when is hot), good beaches are both north or south of that great town (lignano, lido di jesolo, rimini, riccione)<br>  liguria: santa margherita is good, but not only, there are also rapallo, portofino, porto venere, san remo (all beaches, shopping, calm)<br>  i'm from turin, here we have an egyptian museum and a car museum, some castles and some church to visit<br>  milan is the center in fact of haute couture and shopping<br>  <br>  when you're in italy, you'll be able to decide better where to go, bye|`|R6lkgEiyaa	Hi!!=) I'm italian and I live in Oderzo, very little town near Treviso..<br>  Oderzo is in Veneto and isn't very far from Venice, Milan, Jesolo...<br>  I think is a very beauiful zone... excuse me if my english isn't verygood=) kisses!!|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	We were in Italy at the end of June last year, just as the real summer weather started.  We were told that it had been disappointingly wet till then in Northern Italy so a pacamac might be a useful thing to take along.  We were staying at an hotel on Lake Garda<br>  We actually found the summer temperatures a little over the top (for us) not being accustomed to so much sunshine.  Venice was very humid as you might expect and an air-conditioned bar with cold drinks very welcome.  Enjoyed a boat trip there.<br>  Went to Verona (twice) once on a day trip - saw Juliet's house, etc., and returned the following evening to visit the Opera in the open air amphitheatre - that was quite an experience.<br>  A night cruise on Lake Garda stopping at one of the other villages on the opposite side of the lake, having a beer by the water and night time shopping for gifts added to the fun.<br>  I would have felt perfectly safe on my own in the places we visited, in fact, I wandered off and left husband to do his own thing several times.<br>  Can''t help with Southern Italy/coast - only other place I've visited is Rome|`|tAZw98ksaa	If you have time you should definitely visit the Italian Alps.  A beautiful place to visit is Cortina d'ampezo.  You can go on hikes of all different types, and, if you like to mushroom hunt Cortina is full of spots with chantarelles and bulleits.  The only setback to this is that you have to buy a permit if you're afraid of getting caught by the forest service.  Cortina is also very artistic and if you go to "La Corsa Italia" (the main street in Cortina) you can meet new people, learn about the city, and listen to street performers and scheduled musical concerts ranging from the classic "Cortinese" style to rock to classical.  It's a wonderful place to be and it really immerses you in the culture, especially if you take a walk away from the mainstream tourist areas.|`|M2BA0PEyaa	Venice is awesome! And Verona too! In Milan you can do a lot of shopping because there are loads of shops and boutiques (as in every town of Italy) but there are many monuments too... Turin is a fantastic town to visit... In Piedmont on the Lake Maggiore there are some pretty towns like Arona (it's more for youngs because there are lots of pubs and a very nice disco) and Stresa (it's more elegant than Arona and nearby Stresa there are the Borromeo Islands) and on the Lake Orta there's Orta-San Giulio (it's really romantic and San Giulio Island it's fantastic) (in these areas in summer there are lots of German and English people) In Liguria there are many pretty towns on the coast (like Santa Margherita Ligure, Finale Ligure, Portofino and the area of the Cinque Terre)... Tuscany is marvellous, with its colourfoul fields and hills (Florence, Pisa and Lucca are faboulous; Viareggio and Forte dei Marmi are touristic towns). I think that Southern Italy is as beautiful as Northern, but the sea ist more beautiful... Climate is warm in Northern Italy and hot in Southern... Bye bye, I hope i helped you!|`|224a7eaaf46eec4d949ffc56fb6e1c6faa	use the train, cheap.<br>  visit Venice, Florence and Rome, then check Amalfi out and if you like capri, ischia and maybe Sicily (a bit dangerouse), but also cinque terre is beautiful and if you like the night life go to Rimini to the beach.<br>  Ciao
AA12327715	I stayed in the Villas at the Wilderness Lodge a few years back. It was vvveerryy nice. Easy to get to the parks, very nice lobby, a good restaurant in the lobby, another restaurant type thing near the exit to the main pool, a HUGE and beautiful pool, an arcade, etc. <br>  I loved it. The rooms we stayed in were amazing. <br>  <br>  The closest park is Magic Kingdom and there are various ways to get there. We mainly just took the boat across the lake to get there and it was very nice. <br>  <br>  It's a short boat ride across from Disney's Contemporary Resort. The importance of that is the fact that you can catch the Monorail there. The Contemporary Resort also has Chef Mickey's. It's a really great character Buffet. We went there for breakfast and it has a huge selection of foods and the different characters come around to the table and such. It's very fun. <br>  <br>  From my experience, being in the area of Animal Kingdom tends to make it feel like it's 10 degrees hotter outside. Around the Wilderness Lodge there are a lot of pine trees which creates a good amount of shade and it also sits on a nice big lake. It's good for staying cooled down if you aren't a fan of the Florida heat and humidity. <br>  <br>  I'm sure they both have their positive points, but with the construction at Animal Kingdom Lodge to build the Villas, I'd definitely go with the Wilderness Lodge. You won't be disappointed.<br>  <br>  I should add: I grew up in the Pacific Northwest and the wilderness lodges are modeled after the Pacific Northwest... so I might just be a teeny bit biased. It's amazing though. :)|`|72hMibsVaa	both are expensive... try Pop Century Music.... it is a cool place.. 4 pools, each shaped for the era of music they are in, ie.. computer, flower, etc. <br>  <br>  you can watch fireworks form one of the buildings on the 3rd floor.  <br>  <br>  Arcade <br>  <br>  busses to and from parks and downtown disney<br>  <br>  and by far 2-4 hundred dollars cheaper than AK lodge or Wilderness lodge.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Animals Kingdom Lodge resort is so much better.

Personally, I prefer Animal Kingdom a little more just because of the animals.  But as far as things to do and decor and stuff, they are equally nice.|`|AA10024451	Hmmm.....Animal Kingdom Lodge or the Wilderness Lodge? <br>  <br>  Both of them are beautiful hotels, both in the "deluxe resort" category, and both would pretty much guarantee you a great stay. <br>  <br>  But to decide which one to choose to stay in, it's ultimately your decision. Some of the things I would consider before I decide on which resort to choose are: <br>  <br>  (1) Are there going to be children in my party? If so, they would most likely enjoy the Animal Kingdom Lodge resort better because of the views of the animals and the overall theme of the resort. <br>  <br>  (2) Which of the Disney World theme parks do I see myself spending most of my time at? If it's the Magic Kingdom, I would personally choose the Wilderness Lodge simply because of its close proximity to it. (It's just a short boat ride or bus ride away.) If you see yourself spending most time in Epcot, Hollywood Studios, or Animal Kingdom......the logical choice would be the Animal Kingdom Lodge. <br>  <br>  (3) How much of an issue is money? In looking here (<a href="http://allears.net/acc/faq_hot.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://allears.net/acc/faq_hot.htm)</a> you can click on the "fact sheet" for both resorts and can see the difference in per night room rates. According to 2009 prices, Animal Kingdom rates run anywhere from $240/night - $2920/night. The Wilderness Lodge 2009 rates go from $240/night - $1405/night. <br>  <br>  But again, you would have a great stay in either place. They are beautifully themed, immaculately clean, and each has their own great eating places and other fun things for you or the kids with you to enjoy.

MVVQrEasaa	Yes, you can have those things with you (i.e. not in your checked baggage) when you travel.<br>  <br>  You'll probably be required to take off your shoes, your jacket and empty your pockets of any metal before going through security.  You may also have to take off your belt if the buckle is large.<br>  <br>  Your carry on bag and anything you've taken off or out of your pockets will go through the security scanner, and once they are screened you'll be allowed to get them back when you've walked through the metal detectors yourself.<br>  <br>  Remember that you can only carry on liquids in 3 ounce bottles or smaller, and all liquids must be placed in a clear quart sized bag to go through security.|`|NhYdZ91gaa	Uh...sure?

5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	Japanese as a whole do not love mini things.  This is a generalization and your teacher should know better.<br>  <br>  If you look at a Japanese home vs. American home, you will see things are smaller, yes. This is because Japan is 1.) very dense population wise, so apts are small. 2.) the Japanese tend to be short on an average.<br>  <br>  My refrigerator is about 55 inches, it's very small. My car is very small, as well.  I wouldn't be able to take it to the US because it wouldn't meet California's safety regulations because of size, the doors would be too thin, and other things. Very light. <br>  <br>  Japanese do not need large things. So, they use smaller things. They also do not want to waste. So that is another reason why things would be "mini"|`|ycWKfhdgaa	Well, you need to look at the population layout in Japan.  Most live in urban settings that don't allow for many items.  Mini things would fit into their tiny apartments.  I'd suggest naming some things that are tiny and explaining why they are needed to condense their property.  For example, an iPhone is a phone, MP3 player, mini-laptop....ect.  Imagine how many items and iPhone represents.  Also, I'd look up the population demographics for the larger cities in Japan to back up the fact that the live in cramped living conditions.  Good luck!

We are classified as the poorest state and there is a lack of jobs everywhere.  I have been out of work for months and plan to move soon after I graduate.  There is nothing here.  While we are not still segregated, some of us do still hold on that that slave mentality.  Our mayor is corrupt and after all of these years of being on the short end of the stick, we have yet to learn the error of our ways.  I would go to Memphis.

Discriminatory and Dishonest Immigration System.<br>  Immigration to Canada is based on a point system, obtained with your education, qualifications and job experience. Points are good enough for immigration, but in Canada, they are not good enough to get a job in your field. Amazing, how the credentials that qualify you to come to Canada are the same credentials that don't qualify you for your profession in Canada. The reason is, Canada only wants immigrants to do the labor jobs - pizza delivery, driving taxis, factory work etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  7. Out Of Control Cost Of Living.<br>  From rent, to utility bills, to shopping, to phone, internet and cable bills, to gas, to car insurance, to eating out, to basically anything you have to pay for or buy, the cost of living in Canada has become astronomical. Recent immigrants are astonished as to how expensive everything is. It is estimated that compared to most countries around the world, the cost of living in Canada is on average five times greater.<br>  <br>  <br>  6. Health Care Crisis.<br>  Practicing physicians in Canada are in a shortage, 1 in 4 Canadians cannot get a family doctor. Canadian doctors are leaving to move permanently to the United States. Statistics Canada and the Canadian Medical Association both have identified that for every 1 American doctor that moves to Canada, 19 (nineteen) Canadian doctors move to the United States! Doctors in Canada are overworked and underpaid, and there is a cap on their salaries.<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Very High Taxes.<br>  Yes, you have the GST, the PST, totaling 15%, on practically everything you purchase and many other taxes taken out of our weekly paycheck. You have to pay a whopping amount to the government, out of your hard earned salary, so that the government can turn around and give it to beer drinking, hockey watching welfare bums. Fair? It does not matter, it's Canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Money Hungry Government.<br>  Canadian Embassies around the world lie to foreigners, painting this picture that Canada is Utopia, because they want them to come to Canada. Why? Because foreigners bring money! So after being deceived, these foreigners come. They must bring with them at least $10,000. Canada has an immigration quota of 250,000 per year. So please do the math, 250,000 multiplied by $10,000 each equals a whopping 2.5 Billion dollars that Canada gains from immigrants every year.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. No Culture.<br>  Unlike almost every other country in the world, Canada has no culture. Actually American culture is what dominates Canada. When was the last time you had some 'Canadian' food? There are no Canadian traditions and there is no national identity. What does it even mean to call yourself a 'Canadian'. . .nothing really. People living in Canada, still identify themselves with the country they 'originally' came from.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Worst Weather.<br>  Yes, Canada has the worst weather conditions of any country in the world. Freezing cold temperatures, snow, ice, hail, winds, storms etc. From the Prairie provinces to the Maritimes, from the Territories to southern Ontario, the weather is so horrific and disgusting that many Canadians leave Canada simply because of this reason alone.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. No Jobs.<br>  Yes, coast to coast, there are no jobs. Immigrants are highly qualified (MD's, PhD's, Lawyers, Engineers etc.) but they are driving taxi cabs, delivering pizza's or working in factories. Even people with bachelors degrees from Canadian Universities cannot find jobs after graduation. This is the tragedy associated with immigration to Canada. I feel sorry for those immigrants who are stuck in Canada for the rest of their lives. It is indeed a very sad and hopeless future.<br>  <br>  <br>  Broad daylights shootings.<br>  <br>  Break-ins and MS 13 (Most dangerous gang in the world)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Vancouver is now...<br>  <br>  The Gang Capital of North America.<br>  <br>  ... and fast becoming worst...<br>  <br>  MS13 is now right on your son's and daughter's doorsteps.

All together, these countries have a combined population, including dependencies, of over 129 million. She holds each crown separately and equally in a shared monarchy, and carries out duties in and on behalf of all the states of which she is sovereign. Elizabeth is also Head of the Commonwealth, Supreme Governor of the Church of England, Duke of Normandy, Lord of Mann, and Paramount Chief of Fiji. In theory her powers are vast; however, in practice, and in accordance with convention, she rarely intervenes in political matters.

AA11937736	Cafes, tea houses, pubs, taverns and other such places have been a part of most cultures around the world as a place for people to gather and meet their friends.<br>  <br>  This once was true in the United States too but the growth of the suburban culture, the enormous increase of the size of homes, and the increasing physical social isolation that springs from the growth of TV and the internet as means of both communication and entertainment has changed that in most of the USA.<br>  <br>  But in France, as well as most European countries, people live in smaller spaces and live more densely packed and therefore the cafe remains a good place to meet with friends (rather than in one's small apartment) or even just to find some space.<br>  <br>  Its also connected to the greater formality of European culture. Americans will invite people over to their house on first meeting while Europeans tend to meet new acquaintances in public places.|`|cb9c8be6c633186631612c54c6c11d0aaa	it is a place to meet your friends at any hours as to opposed to inviting your friends at home,<br>  a place to relax,talk,have a coffee or else? meet other people as well,<br>  a sure place to find your friends,make plans for the evening to go eat somewhere,or just hang around and have fun,<br>  a place where one knows others, feel at home,(sort of speak),<br>  a place where you know for a fact that one or more of your friends will be there,and you do not need a reason to go,<br>  it is part of the culture,tradition.<br>  many cafes have some local artist perform,art expositions,and things of that nature..summer activities,<br>  some special luncheons or dinners,<br>  it is a second home away from home(sort of speak)..<br>  a good reason to get out of your house too.|`|i2FRvkEpaa	Not just in France, no, not just in France. A cafe is a great place to have a cup of espresso (of course), maybe read a book or a paper, chit chat, simply relax if there is a terrace or even maybe write (I do that). Of course, a ciggie goes well with your coffee and your work or whatever you do there. Unfortunately, in modern times governments have chosen to go along with the smoking ban fashion and hence most cafes have become much less interesting places. But fortunately, I can still find a few where I can smoke during the act of creation. If you're an anti-smoker yourself, you won't understand. But I do. :)|`|HfA298Jvaa	Yeah, it's just not in France.

Some bars might not like you using their toilet but they are usually kind so if see you are pregnant you won't have a problem there either and all the touristic areas are full of bars and restaurants. I suggest you get one of those electronic things that guide you through...so you can take as much time as you need in each part and don't feel like you have to rush so you are not left behind.<br>  The Vatican is amazing so I definitely suggest you don't skip that one...oh well, there is a lot of walking to do in Rome but it's just such a wonderful city that I'm sure you'll love it and will want to see everything...you can always take the bus or the subway (which only runs until midnight I think, but I'm not really sure!)|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	We were  in Rome for a day, but used the cafes - there are plenty of them - for bladder calls.

Look for the painting of the Pope with the thorn in his flesh (England!).<br>  Don't attempt to walk from Vatican City to the Trevi fountain - it's quite a hike if you are preggie; plenty of taxis around.<br>  Some of the excavations sites are a bit rough underfoot but not to be missed - you shouldn't have too much of a problem remembering back to my own pregnancy days.<br>  It's a place not to be missed - I'd love to go back for a full couple of weeks and "do" the area properly.|`|Dn63VUsVaa	You can certainly jump out of line and then get back in if you need to run to a cafe. Just be sure someone in your paty remains in line. However, I wouldn't anticipate waiting in line, really there have been  none to speak of this year. There are bathrooms located at the museum entrance, again just by the Raphael rooms and Sistine Chapel, and then just downstairs from St. Peter's. A guided tour may be a good idea to get you into St. Peter's without waiting in line or having to exit the museums and walk all the way around. There is a preferred entry for tour groups right from the sistine chapel into St. Peter's. This link may give you some ideas. <a href="http://www.wheninrometours.com/Tours/Group-Walking-Tours/Vatican-City-Tour.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wheninrometours.com/Tours/Gro...</a><br>  Congratulations!|`|6xnDacC9aa	lean latin :Pit's the official language|`|321cc2e3bd745625bd74a2330d2f11e2aa	Bathrooms are easy to find if you stick to Cafes, restaurants, gelato shops, etc... I always bought something or had my husband stand in line and buy a water or something similiar because I felt weird just using someone's bathroom without making a purchase. But, because you are pregnant I do not see it as a problem.. Also, I did find some bathrooms in public places that asked for a small donation of money and I used my loose coins for that.. Carry some extra tissues in your bag just in case bathrooms are not stocked correctly.... And finally, Enjoy.........The beauty of Italy can not be decribed until you have seen it for yourself.

How would you know if you like the city that you are moving to or not? You can't just base everything on what people have recommend. <br>  So I suggest holding off on the one way ticket and purchasing a return ticket instead, back pack around the country and see everything, the big cities and the small outback towns, get a feel for the place.<br>  You are also going to have to do an awful lot or research, for instance, is the education standard the same in both countries? You may find to that enter university (our version of collage) you might be required to complete additional high school courses.<br>  You also need to know the differences in the schooling systems and how that will impact your decision for what you study.

fM7CwTwzaa	Before the Panama Canal was built, ships would sail up the Rio San Juan into Lake Nicaragua where they'd dock in Granada. From there, it's a very short distance overland to the Pacific coast. A Nicaraguan canal would almost certainly have been easier and cheaper to build.<br>  <br>  The real reason the canal was built in Panama instead of Nicaragua was because foreign powers saw an easy opportunity to manipulate what is now Panama, but was then a part of Colombia (El Gran Colombia) and to create a puppet government that would allow the French and the Americans to pretty much exploit the region and its people as they saw fit.<br>  <br>  The true history is more complicated and much sleazier than simple practical geography.|`|lGQ1r2oVaa	It was the shortest route from the atlantic to the pacific.

lcj1AKt1aa	Ash Wednesday is the first day of the Lenten season.  Lent is usually for forty days and ends with the Holy Week.  Holy week has Good Friday when Jesus was crucified and Easter is when he rose from the dead. Mostly Catholics celebrate Ash Wednesday by putting ash on their foreheads. Generally, some people abstain for eating meat, going partying, gambling, smoking and other such devices for the length of the season. That is why you see that everything came to a halt before it started. Lenten season is a very sacred time.<br>  <br>  When I was young there had a woman that had a tree that we uses to prick at 12:00 pm on Good Friday and  blood uses to come from it. Only on this day one can see blood.  I always long to see a tree like this again and only last night I was thinking about it. Some people do not believe me when I tell them about the blood.  it is said that Jesus's cross was made from this tree.|`|fc2wmTCVaa	what the other ppl said :D|`|fuxx93P8aa	It occurs 40 days before Good Friday and is also known as the 'Day of Ashes'. <br>  <br>  According to Roman Catholic, it started as a special preparation for people being baptised during the Easter season. It is also a day when non-christians complete their penance for their reconciliation to the Church during Easter.<br>  <br>  "On Ash Wed-nesday, God invites us to come back to Him. It is a sacred day and is a period of fasting and penance for all members of the Church," said Dufour.<br>  <br>  "This period of Lent is intended to be a time which sinful activities and habits are forsaken," he informed.<br>  <br>  Lent comes from an old English word, Lenten, and means spring.  it signifies that the Church wants persons to have a new spring in their lives.<br>  <br>  "Lent is a very interesting time, during this period we are to put away our sinful acts and let God's way grow in our lives,"

SK5wHr5zaa	Did you accidentally include an r in your intended word. Well in all honesty as Greece is the founder of most of the world's civilizations and the basis of, and indeed the cornerstone of  all modern languages I would be privilaged and honoured to be Greek.

Viva El Greco.|`|5m4yaEJyaa	Absolutely, Greece is the light of the Western World from language, politics, architecture, civilization, food, etc... come on there are 2 types of people, one that are Greeks and the second wanna be Greeks...Turkish Mongols at bottom of list|`|o1N6ZH7xaa	Well, I'm not a Greek, but I'd find it quite interesting to look back at my past.

A Greek has also other things to be proud of, things that have to do with the 'spirit' and the mentality of Greek people. Inventive, so 'in love' with freedom, passionate people, made most of the time the right choices in their history, even if temporarily they seemed to be wrong, we managed- one way or another- through many difficulties to survive and to create a modern country (despite the problems), in a difficult Balkan 'neighborhood'. <br>  We have a rich culture, not only ancient, but modern Greek culture too.|`|yEe3WkFCaa	I am 100% Greek, 100% Proud, 100% tired of trolls, 100% sick of Panais, Feta Cheese, Platypuss.<br>  <br>  But I love being Greek!

pXRsAWMfaa	Overall it is pretty nice...like most towns, it does have its "rough" parts, but depending where you are coming from, it may not seem bad.  The worst thing about living in Sandusky is Cedar Point and the traffic during the summer, but after living there awhile, you will learn ways to get around the Cedar Point traffic.  Right now there are not a lot of job openings (the help wanted section in the classifieds is the emptiest I have ever seen it), but there are not many jobs anywhere in Ohio right now.  There is quite a bit of retail development happening along Route 250, so the retail companies must see Sandusky as a good place.

47962200213b791db38989111c08cdd8aa	io ci sono stata ad agosto proprio lo scorso anno. di giorno la temperatura è elevata, intorno ai 30 gradi e secco. la sera però scende il freddo, intorno ai 5 gradi, io mi ricordo che stavo con la giacca da snow board. se pensi di fare campeggio prendi un sacco a pelo molto pesante e ricorda che il sole tramonta molto in fretta e non appena va via arriva il freddo, soprattutto a sud.|`|2b94d58a31a66332d4e250b60c40fe7faa	umido e piovoso|`|357f002f3490f21083a693c261a3a52daa	Mah!.... ho girato la Namibia 2 settimane 10 anni fa e 2 settimane l'anno scorso e ho preso pioggia 1 solo giorno in tutto. vero è che alla mattina può fare freddo e che sulla skeleton Coast fa freddo di sicuro e c'è molta umidità. Comunque, a parte queste rare occasioni si sta tranquillamente in calzoni leggeri e maglietta /maglioncino. Per gli animali invece è un buon periodo. Le tre pozze attaccate ai campeggi del parco Etosha sono fonte sicura di avvistamenti (notturni) e con un buon mezzo, un pò di tempo e tanta pazienza puoi vedere praticamente tutti gli animali (con la dovuta eccezione dei cacciatori per cui ci vuole un bel pò di fortuna). Se hai bisogno di altre info .... chiedi. Ciao e buona Africa|`|4c36a7c36840e8abff22e94524e09101aa	E' piovoso ed è quindi difficile vedere gli animali che non si radunano più attorno alle pozze. Ma ci sono altre cose da fare, tipo vedere le tribù di boscimani (sono alquanto civilizzati) e degli himba (più autentici) e poi c'è il deserto. Buon viaggio, è una terra bellissima!

4BfHZP0iaa	Swine flu is a kind of flu that pigs get. Recently it has mutated and evolved into a kind of flu that humans can get. For centuries the human immune system has defended humans from the flu and it knows how to do so. Unfortunately the human immune system doesn't know how to fight flu from pigs yet. People get the swine or pig flu from others that sneeze or cough near them. You can not get it by eating pigs but there are dozens of other medical problems that people do get by eating pork. Google pork and medical problems and you,ll be amazed that humans still eat it.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swine_influenza" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swine_influ...</a> this will explain it

BRRIyldgaa	Kobe has a reputation for being a very romantic city.  The period from December to March has even been declared the "Romantic Fair."  <br>  <br>  The night skyline is lovely, especially around the harbor area.  Many couples go to the Harborland area for dinner at the fancy restaurants, shopping, and then maybe a ride on the ferris wheel with views of the port lights.  There are also many romantic dinner cruises available.<br>  <br>  Or, you could visit the hills to the north with views of the city - there are some lovely views at the Venus Bridge, and there you can see hundreds of locks left behind by couples as symbols of their love.<br>  <br>  The biggest romantic event of the year is the Luminarie in December.  Thousands of couples come to see the glittering light displays.  They admire the beautiful lights and snuggle close to each other to stay warm in the winter chill!|`|2kgTdNRQaa	Yokuska.

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	"San", and "Santa" are the masculine and feminine words for "saint" in Spainish.

As the undisputed master of cut and paste, I just found a site with all the cities listed. And since you seem to be lacking in historical information, I'll clue you in: Spain setteld the area, starting in the 1500's. They set up the missions all along the coast, into the 1700's. THEN Mexico won independance from Spain. By then, the names of the missions and pueblos were applied to the area. Since many were named after saints in the Catholic faith, that's why you have so many "San" and "Santa" cities. It wasn't the Mexicans who named these, it was the Spaniards.|`|xqtKODvbaa	wow 2nd answer got it, but obviously he has no life<br>  <br>  you've got to remember that most of the southwest use to be part of Mexico, and with the influence of the Spanish padres, a whole lot of places where named with Spanish saints and royalty.

The water on the west coast is not as warm, not clear, but still has great snorkeling in certain locations.  One thing though, is the west coast I find has more Mexican type towns to visit if that is important to you.  Cancun looks like Miami beach, but you can take tours that take you to pyramids about 3 hours from Cancun.

ECB8u72Taa	The fall and winter are usually the best times to travel to Russia in general.  If you're going to Vladivostok, you'll most likely go through Soeul, or, if you intend on taking the train to your final destination then Moscow or Harbin/China.  However, as you've mentioned, time is a factor for you so you probably won't be able to use those options.<br>  <br>  If you decide you want to travel via Japan, you can go to Vladivostok by ferry from Fushiki, but the nearest airport that I know is Toyama (which is about an hour drive from Fushiki port).  But, you're not really going to save any money, because whatever you save in airfare you'll make up for in taxi/ferry/train costs.  <br>  <br>  And the cheapest origin cities to Russia will be the major traffic hubs such as Los Angeles (LAX), New York (JFK), Newark (NWR), or Atlanta.  And the cheapest carriers will be AirFrance/KLM via Schiphol, Aeroflot, Delta, or (if you're going via Soeul) Korean Air.|`|7sIYGEnmaa	Aeroflot is the main Russian airline and it's tickets are much cheaper. You can visit aeroflot.com and travel with a transfer to another plane if they don't have a straight line to Vladivostok. New York office of Aeroflot speaks English, you can call them.|`|AA11835015	ha ha ha! welcome to russia!!! fly to moscow and take a 7 day train ride to vladivostok! should be a blast.<br>  i live six months a year in russia, 700 miles past moscow. 20 hours by train. my wife is russian so i have a translator, and we have the best traveling companion- out 5 year old boy. he is a trooper, even on these long voyages. so it is not impossible to go 7 days by train. ypou can always jump ship in novosibirsk, a large city on the way and stay a day or two.<br>  enjoy!!<br>  one bag is free per person, limit 50lbs... not 50.3- had to carry on my coat in september!!|`|BLD9EEWNaa	Aeroflot- you can sometimes get a 350$ ticket from JFK in NY to Saint Petersburg.|`|jmJmgG3xaa	Try visiting the aeroflot website. www.aeroflot.ru  The prices are often better if you buy direct from then rather than going to expedia or other similar online travel agencies.   There is a back and forth flight from New York to Moscow at only 800 dollars, if you book about a month in advance.   And from Moscow to VVO, there are plenty of local airline companies where you can buy for less.   Back and forth would be about 600 dollars.   It's seven days travel by train from Moscow to VVO.  And it's twice more expensive than the plane ticket.
YhECDSKRaa	It could work out... but it won't necessarily work out.  The biggest problem will be getting a decent paying job right now.  The recession is hitting Hawaii hard.  Tourism, our major industry is down & that has an effect on all areas of our economy.  I suspect you will have a hard time getting into car sales because not so many folks are buying cars.  Without a strong professional or trade background, you are likely to end up making minimum wage or a bit more, which is not a living wage here.  If you decide to pursue your dream, just be sure to have enough $$ set aside to get yourself home if it doesn't work out.  Good luck to you.|`|2HX9sIwpaa	that's not enough money to come up here, trust me. it's going to diaspper right infront of your eyes. the rent and houses are real pricey... also the food!|`|6IoRjowUaa	I have a coworker that is renting out an entire house for $2000 a month, no utilities.  You would get a whole house for two months while trying to figure things out.|`|0kP7a73Iaa	If you ever umemployed, take a look here www.23mj.info/jobseek  and theres a high chance you'll find the right job.|`|COWsSguVaa	It's expensive to live here. Especially Oahu, because it is one of the most developed and populated of all the islands. Just like the mainland, it is hard to get work here nowadays. Unless if you are a doctor or a nurse. Nowadays, hospitals are always looking for doctors or nurses. There is a big shortage. Besides that, it is very hard to find work. A lot of people are unemployed, just like that mainland. <br>  <br>  If you lucky enough to get a job here, the worst you can do is earn minimum wage , which is about 7 dollars an hour. Maybe you can afford to pay like 300 or 400 dollars a month if you live with a room mate. There are always good room mate deals on craiglist. <br>  <br>  It's a bad time to move here if you don't know where are you going to be working or staying. A lot of mainlanders move here thinking they will get a job right away, but they are still unemployed. <br>  <br>  I recommend you come and visit here, and see if you like it. Living here is nice, I love it. But I wouldn't have never moved here if I didn't get the job offer to move here. I am a medical doctor. I make about $245,000 a year, so I live quite comfortably. <br>  <br>  Maybe go to college first and medical school. Doctors live really well here. Good luck|`|vWsElUtGaa	I would check apt.com or one of those search engines for a roommate until you can get a decent job. You can find places for cheap but there are ghetto. Most people who live in the nice places of Oahu are large families,retires or millionaires. If you want to live down town near all the jobs i would try to get a job at one of car dealer ships near down town and maybe get a part time till you find something better. It can be done, I have some friends that did the same thing and have been living there for years.|`|vaM9JtcTaa	not enough money, will run out fast.|`|AvI9V7zRaa	Even people with degrees can't get jobs there.  There aren't enough jobs!  Even minimum wage jobs you have to fight thousands of people for.  When they were hiring for a Target that's opening up, they had a line of about a thousand people in a matter of 4 hours!  In one day!<br>  <br>  People live there, yes... but do you know how many families live in one house?  Think parents, their children, their children's children, their grandparents... all in one house.  That's how they're able to afford to live... otherwise, they can't afford to get their own apartments.<br>  <br>  Your 5k will be gone in 2 months... and that's not including your plane ticket back to the mainland.

Most of the filming for the Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Parade is done in advance.  You will not see any celebrities in the parade, just the regular and wonderful Disney Cast Members.  If you really want to see celebrities, Disney's Grand Floridian Resort is usually the place to see them during off seasons.<br>  <br>  Have fun - Disney World is extra magical over the Christmas Season!<br>  |`|AA11469894	If you are asking about seeing a celebrity just walking down Main Street with the regular crowd then the chances are mediocre, that is if you are looking for them and not enjoying your vaction.  Now chances are alot smaller that they will be an A or even B list celebrity as most of them want to back doored everywhere.<br>  Instead of worrying about seeing a celeb though I think that you should worry about enjoying YOUR vacation.  Besides that's what they are at Disney for as well not to be bothered but to have fun.  |`|AA11539788	I would not bank on this happening...possible..not probable
cSOwqXKxaa	You're referring to intercontinental flights, right?  Then RyanAir is a definite yes - they do have some minor restrictions, but I found they were the best for pricing overall.  I secured a flight from Hamburg to London for a penny.  Yes, $0.01.  Plus taxes and fees, it was $25.00.  Now, this was summer of 2006, so I wonder if their regulations have changed at all, but aside from feeling like I was riding in a weird plastic-y bus, RyanAir was terrific.<br>  <br>  RyanAir has a 15 kg checked baggage limit (about 33 lbs.)  If booked online you will be charged 4 pounds / 5 euros.  If in person, 8 pounds / 10 euros.  You're allowed 1 piece of cabin baggage, not to exceed 10 kg (about 22 lbs.) and must be within the following size: 55cm x 40cm x 20cm  (21.65" x 15.75" x 7.87").

R7Hexutqaa	It's not the best neighborhood, but it is livable.  Between OBT and Texas Ave it is congested with older apartment complexes.  They look nice and are mostly well maintained but it can be rough.  Just north of there is a condo complex called Tymberskan.  Avoid it at all costs.  But there are other small condo's in the area that are livable.   Between Texas and John Young Pkwy there is an older neighborhood of small houses.  After crossing John Young it converts to Conroy road and the Apartments are newer, pricier and a bit safer.  This is near the Millenia Mall - Very Upscale|`|HvFIHu3saa	not a good area hope your spanish is good all the mexicans live over there and the crime rate is not good either try to move somewhere else stay away from pine hills,carver shores,parramore and the area you mentioned.|`|L9Cx70gtaa	Sorry..  bad<br>  "Hot Spots: Most Orlando-area murders take place west of Interstate 4 and along Orange Blossom Trail. This year, crime hot spots include Pine Hills, Holden Heights, Americana Boulevard near Texas Avenue, the Oak Ridge neighborhood, and areas around Parramore and Washington Shores.<br>  <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/custom/data/orl-homicidemap-main,0,4865031.htmlpage" rel="nofollow">http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/cust...</a>|`|z6O5ifdGaa	No that area of town isn't very safe. It's lower income and higher crime rate. I really wouldn't move there. If you look at a map, you'll see Americana Blvd, Rio Grande Ave, Oak Ridge... etc, that whole area is bad news. <br>  <br>  There is an area called Millenia which is close to there that is Ok to live in, by the Mall of Millenia.|`|ghUm8M3laa	That area is about a 6 of 10.  It may be a walk in the park compared to "bad areas" in NY but for Orlando it's about in the middle.  It could be worse and it could be better.  As in all things use common sense and you should be safe.  |`|P0o7J5W4aa	high crime area.<br>  drugs,hookers,criminals.|`|AA11469894	Like everywhere else in the world there are going to be problems here.  Americana is not the best part of town, but it is about the most affordable, so you will get what you pay for; older housing, more crime with less protection, not much if any amenities included, etc...<br>  The area does consist of a larger percentage of hispanics and Haitians so if you are of any other race you will be a minority.  However if you don't have a car you are right on the Lynx Bus route, there are plenty of shopping and food choices in the area, and like I stated earlier it is one of the more affordable parts of Orlando.<br>  Good luck with the move!!!|`|0xIPtV3Saa	umm, no!! I have lived in orlando my whole life. If you can move do it. I live in maitland, fl, which is bout 10 min from downtown orlando from Interstate 4. Very safe there. I try to stay out of orlando, its not like bigger cities, orlando is very dirty and lots of crime. stay either in maitland, lake mary, or in metro west. You can look them all up and each is very close to I-4 which takes you right to downtown orlando in less than 15-20 min. |`|Lqcn1ndvaa	That's not really all that safe.  If you have kids or something, you may want to consider moving to Saint Cloud.  You could consider it Kissimee' sister city I guess, but St. Cloud is smaller and has way less gang activity.

AA11469894	There are a few apartments right outside of Disney property, that seem fairly nice, and the pricing isn't half bad either.  Right now I'm looking at Mystic Pointe, I have a few friends that stay there and they don't have any complaints (they have kids, and I have an 11 month old, so I too am looking for safety).  Mystic Point is income restricted but the pricing is just under $700 for a 2/2.  Right next to it is Parc Vue and Alexandria which are nicer newer but the pricing is a good $200+ for a 2/2 compared to Mystic Pointe.  Buena Vista Place was also nice and cheaper, but their restrictions were a bit much for me.  Buena Vista Point Apartments was my favorite but they didn't have any openings for the time frame I needed, but the were just over $700 for a 2/2.  And the best part is with all of them (except Buena Vista Point Apartments) is that they are on a side road that tourists wouldn't go down because it's all residential areas.  Plus you can see the Disney fireworks at night (you can hear them too but it's not bad).<br>  <br>  Like I said these are all right around the corner from Disney, and about 10 minutes from Sea World and maybe 20 from Universal.  Good luck with the move.|`|4oo2Idlyaa	UCF area (east orange county), oviedo, winter springs, winter park, casselberry -- check these areas out. I doubt you'll want to live so close to the attractions --lots of tourists...and they're not in the best areas.... anywhere you live in orlando, the parks will still be close!|`|HvFIHu3saa	the good areas is metrowest,windermere,dr philips but depending on your budget you pay to live in the good areas.|`|ZoDc6Ajpaa	Somewhere in the greater Orlando not in Orange Country would prolly be safest.  But if you want to be in Orlando, I heard Millena and Northbridge near i drive are nice|`|jwsjeZIoaa	Would you consider living outside of Orlando i.e. Kissimmee in Osceola county. Its a stones throw away from Orlando and very close to Disney. Quite a big place but very safe and comfortable. I used to live in a place called Venetian bay villages, The apartment there was lovely and it was a gated community with security which gives that extra peace of mind when you have kids. There are a lot of places like this around the Kissimmee area. The prices are quite reasonable as well,although I cant remember them off the top of my head, sorry about that. Good luck finding something.|`|0UOBreekaa	I would check out the apartments in Celebration. They are very safe the Metro West area isn't bad either|`|vHB9zUcCaa	the best thing I can suggest is 2 contact the property agencies down there & tell them what U told us on here.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes!!!|`|ROdHsYVAaa	There really isn't one...<br>  <br>  The best I can think of is in Dr. Phillips - it's got good schools and is about 15 min from the parks.  But it's expensive. Lake Buena Vista is also nice.  Anywhere cheap is going to be farther from the parks and you're looking at more violence/ robberies... Gated communites don't even help; my jeep was broken into in a fully gated community with security.....darned neighbors.<br>  <br>  Of course, "near" the parks you have to deal with all the tourists and traffic...it's ugly during X-mas and spring break.  <br>  <br>  I can tell you where to avoid..? Paramore, Westmoreland steets... downtown... Conway area, and near UCF (lots of college students, currently a serial rapist running around...) Pine Hills, Goldenrod/ Rio Pinar, Orange Blossom Train (route 17 / 92...), Kissimmee (downtown)...and anything on Americana / Rio Grande aves... (or that neighborhoods around it..). They are the worst sections of town...

pcHp7Dgkaa	Your question was originally asked on US Answers and I assume that's where you're from so that gives you another possible alternative to an immediate skilled migration visa. <br>  <br>  You could come on a 12 month Work And Holiday visa as soon as you graduate and hope that you can get some experience here and perhaps even find an employer to sponsor you for a visa during that time. Your occupation is one of the most needed here and the chances of finding work and a sponsor are actually quite good if you really work at it. If you can find a sponsor, you can apply for an employer sponsored visa while you're still in Australia on your 'working holiday'. Most (though not all) employer sponsored visas are temporary to begin with and without experience that may be all you can get at first, but there's a definite pathway to permanence within a couple of years.<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday/" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-...</a><br>  <br>  Otherwise, you will either have to wait until you finish your studies and have some experience in an occupation needed in Australia, or come as an International student and complete your studies here. Skilled immigration visas are easier to get if you have Australian qualifications and experience and graduate visas are available to allow you to get the additional experience necessary to qualify for permanent residence.<br>  <br>  If it all sounds unwelcoming and obstructive, you should consider that we have only a small population and apart from our refugee intake, are unable to support new arrivals who are not immediately able to contribute to our economy in occupations in which we have a shortage of workers. Believe me, it's much harder for Aussies to emigrate to the US.|`|OvJpK2Zsaa	there is no other option<br>  <br>  skilled migration is the only way unless you can afford the high fees to study and get your qualifications in a skilled occupation in australia

jLTDqVHsaa	Though they don't actually play in New York City, I'd have to go with the Giants right now.  However, that changes wildly depending on who's currently winning games.  The Knicks have been a joke over the last few years (though they're on the way), and the Rangers are in a struggle given hockey's overall struggle for popularity.  By contrast, the Giants are a playoff team and the most recent Super Bowl champion (though this will change next week).    When baseball season comes around, though, the Mets and Yankees will completely dominate the attention of New York sports fans.|`|958EXZEhaa	GIANTS ofcourse|`|fLF2VM8uaa	Right now the Giants because they are winning.     The Knicks had traditionally been the most popular but they have sucked for almost 10 years and their popularity has waned greatly.

xiB1BPwsaa	I have noticed that also. The way I figure it is that they are the only group in Canada that has an identity.

Since you are a "Yankee", I assume you're asking why French Canadians are more polite than Americans?     I'm wondering how many experiences you are basing this on as well.

I don't think you can generalize like that with any sort of accuracy.    EDIT: I think some people here have too much time on their hands and should just grow up and find something productive to do.

That's a good one. French Canadians have a reputation for rudeness. If you are a Yankee, and have visited La Belle Province, you would likely have stayed in a hotel.

But the average french-speaking French Canadian is not, and never has been, noted for being polite.|`|NG6eeCfuaa	You must be referring to hotel staff and whatnot, as Quebecois are as rude as they come.

MtSNwCi7aa	I think that one hypothesis not being proposed yet is that Disney hooks children and keeps them captive for life. The adult Disney fans are happily enslaved. Though I can't understand it specifically - I'm not saying this is good or bad - and I can understand it generally as Nestle has captivated me 100% and I'm pretty sure they snatched me as a child. I love Nestle Quick, Willie Wonka, Coffeemate, Lean Cuisine - you name it - if it has a shelf life and I love it, it is likely Nestle. To aim at children is uncomfortable. But Disney aiming at me as an adult is on the mark - I am thankful they have created shows like "Alias" and movies like that little sweetie, Ratatouile. Just because that little mouse got under my skin, does not mean I have seen more than five of the animated movies in my life. On the contrary, I knew a couple of grown women who would be as happy watching a "Cinderella" video on a Friday night as "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button." They were bonkers for all things Disney, especially the commercialized stuff like re-working winnie the pooh (ugh!). They took a trip to Disneyworld together, not being first timers, at about age 24 but were hesitant to tell people because they thought those people would be jealous if they weren't invited. that struck me as very out of touch and it was one of the first indications I was starting to have less and less in common with them. I would guess their parents had the money to bring them at the right age (~ages 4-7?) and it imprinted on them forever. My parents left me at home when I was about age four and instead took an older family member and my foster brother who was about age fourteen. I remember being devastated as they all came back raving about what a "magical place it was." At the time, it seemed cruel, but now I realize they did me a favor as all that mickey-mania never "took" with me. My parents took me to Disneyworld in my early adolescence but I could not understand why everyone had been raving about plaster spinning on spindles. In my mid teens, I was taken there again and though I'd been given a hundred or so dollars for spending money, I used only ~$12.00 of it to get a tee-shirt. Had D-land really captured my imagination, I'm sure I would have spent it all. And on this next statement, perhaps i lose all credibility in light of my jaded past, but i had almost forgotten that my husband went to Disneyland in his 20's for the first time and loved it - I think you are a unique individual to be able to do that. Back to the sisters' grim, since they love the Disney vacation resorts and everything Disney - I assume they're still shopping often - I think it's possible that country lines become blurred to them and the world is just one big Disney themepark. It would be like arriving in New York and wanting to hit each and every landmark - the Statue of Liberty, MOMA, the Brooklyn Bridge but instead it's Disney/Florida, Disney/California, Disney/Europe and Disney/Japan. One of the two women raved about a trip she took to Europe where she saw something like fourteen countries in twelve days. I was astonished anyone could love such a harried hurry hurry all inclusive trip with tour guide (is she bionic? is she immune to jet lag?). I prefer staying longer in one country and seeing and experiencing local restaurants and whatever that particular country has to offer and most lovely of all - meeting the people. I have a hard time understanding her but I try to keep an open mind. As far as the kid-less thing, that I must applaud. I have met a small but memorable handful of people who use their kids as an excuse to stay home but spend more time playing golf, gabbing on the phone, gossiping, getting into petty intrigues or clothes shopping etc than actually taking care of their kids and what i find amazing is how they brag about how much they've sacrificed! I think it's one thing to do all of the above time-wasters but it's another to do them and infer you wouldn't if you didn't have to stay home with the children. While i believe most stay-at-home mothers do take wonderful care of their children, i am only talking about those that do not. i think the children who's mothers are profoundly distracted would prefer to be in a well-run daycare or with a compassionate nanny. so, i agree that it's a shame not to appreciate the treasures in each country and trade them in in order to compare the finer shades of Disneylands, -worlds, -etc, but if one is going to indulge in a guilty-pleasure like eurodisney, i applaud their authenticity in doing it in a spirit of transparency!!! bravo! encore!|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	They're trying to recapture parts of their lives that they missed out on. It also REMINDS them of being innocent, letting them fall into the trance of wonderment and fantasy.     Personally, I think it's pretty lame for an adult to do that, but that's why.|`|YL0DypySaa	Because they feel like it. Is it really bothering you so much?|`|z7gLIRxfaa	I have adult friends who simply can't get enough of Disney--it's their "thing".  I don't get that, but we're all different.    For them, going to EuroDisney is a chance to see if it is the same or different--are the songs in English or French?  Are the rides the same?  Do they have the same rides or are they different or better?  It's also said that EuroDisney is much less crowded so perhaps this is also an opportunity to see more in a visit with less lines and hastle.    Going to Disney doesn't mean you are giving up something else either.  Some people are not interested in Muse D'Orsay, but that doesn't mean they are ignorant any more that those who don't care for jazz music or shopping.    It occured to me to visit EuroDisney just because of some of these things and I thought I could get in "free" because I have a good friend who works for them.  But I changed my mind becasue of exactly what you said.  But that's me.  Other folks want to spend their time at parks because that's their idea of fun, just like your idea of fun is singing with friends in a club.|`|W3RqvvGHaa	In my opinion, it is simply ignorance and a waste of time & money. We go to France about once each year to visit my son & family in Tours. It's true that we take outings that revolve around their 4 year old (like local parks, etc). But we do not take him to see the "major sights" as he can not appreciate them. Similarly, I have a son-in-law that loves to travel. If he is even close to another country or state, he will drive into it and back out just so he can say he was there. This guy is well educated (has a masters degree and is principal of a middle school). Go figure :-)|`|AA12016117	Chacun a son gout!  Obviously everyone has their own agenda.     I've seen so many instances of people wanting to gravitate towards their own compatriots when abroad, even if their visit is only for a short time.  I was in a Parisian bathroom when an English lady commented to my friend and me how nice it was to hear an English voice.  I found that difficult to understand.  We'd come to France to hear French, to experience the culture, sights, food, etc, and had plenty of time to hear English when we returned to London!  Someone else complained about drinking coffee out of bowls when we were touring the wonderful chateaux of the Loire Valley.      I see many questions on this site from English people asking where they can get English food in other countries, or can they get teabags/chocolate/whatever in Paris, Rome, etc.  In Crete a few years ago, I steered clear of the Irish Pub and the places where they promised the Full English Breakfast.  Some years ago I spent time with my English boyfriend based in Budapest who remarked (not altogether positively) upon my interest in meeting the Hungarians and visiting their own particular places instead of sticking with the English people of the office in doing their own activities.    From my own point of view, the last place on my list when visiting France would be Disneyland.  If I want Disneyland, Id go to America where it would surely be the best.  When in France, Ill go for the art, history, culture, food and so on.  Ill admit it seems a little extraordinary that the French permitted such a diversion in their country!    I do wonder sometimes why people want to go to foreign countries if they dont want to savour the differences and leave behind the familiar for a while.  I do understand a yearning for the things one has grown up with if one is living abroad  but for a few days or weeks, isnt it a little bit sad that one cant embrace something exciting and different and new?      Im not sure if I answered your question; but I do agree with you.  I dont know the answer.  Perhaps its just the fear of the unknown?|`|LCAZJrVNaa	Hello Rilifan, how are you ?    You are right, Disneyland is a good attraction but there are so many interesting things to do and to see in Paris !    It's a pitty to waste time in Disneyland for people who stay only 3 or 4 days in Paris.|`|e92b3196a41c458c327a3060d19fef50aa	I know more than a few adults who love going to Disney World on vacation, without kids.

I guess if you are really into the whole Disney thing, then it would be on your must do list when/if you go to France.|`|j4PRKElGaa	Euro Disney is basically a duplicate of any other Disney park in America, so for some Americans, perhaps they feel safer in an environment they are familiar with outside of their comfort zone. Getting there involves rubbing elbows with different cultures, so not all is lost. I really believe it is the Journey.. not the destination.     Perhaps they heard about Disneyland all during their childhoods and their families could never afford to take them there, so as adults they save their money and realize a life long childhood dream.     I am just happy to see people traveling, going outside of their back yards and exposing themselves to new experiences. Eventually, once the thirsty child in their heart is quenched, perhaps the Mona Lisa and Versailles will capture their imaginations after all.    As you know, i have a company in Paris managing events and individual visits and I know that there are so many things about this city including Euro Disney that bring alot of joy to people, so why question it? As long as they are happy, you should be too.    ;0)  Bisou!  Wendy|`|oHtA3ULaaa	Your comments remind me of the old saying" one man's trash is another man's treasure."  Sure, Eurodisney is commercialism.  OTOH, I am sure that there is no commercialism on the Champs Elysse!  Ppl on vacation should feel free to do what they want and not just go to the "cod liver oil" attractions (good for you, but tastes terrible).  Some ppl get pleasure from the rides, seeing Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse, etc.  Others don't.  If you don't, then avoid Eurodisney.  I also suspect that some ppl from Canada and the UK visit Eurodisney bc of their attraction to American culture.  BTW, I don't care for amusement parks either (despite my nickname) and when I was in Paris I only visited the museums.

AA11435892	New Jersey train from Penn Station to either the Hamilton or Trenton station.     If you get off at Hamilton, you need to take a cab or have someone drive you to Ewing.     If you get off at Trenton, you can either cab it or you can play a really strange transfer game with Septa, requiring you to go into Philadelphia, and transferring to the West Trenton bound train, getting off at West Trenton which is right next to Ewing.     Or you can take a bus from the Port Authority and transfer to four different buses.     Here is the link to the bus route. http://www.njtransit.com/sf/sf_servlet.s...        Personally, I would take the train to Trenton and just cab it the rest of the way. Its probably the best way.

It is Hamas.    Hamas is committing at least six violations of international law, Professor Irwin Cotler explained.    "First, the deliberate targeting of civilians is in and of itself a war crime," he noted, referring to the Hamas rockets fired at southern towns for eight years.    "A second war crime is when Hamas attacks [from within] civilian areas and civilian structures, whether it be an apartment building, a mosque or a hospital, in order to be immune from a response from Israel," he went on.  "Civilians are protected persons, and civilian areas are protected areas.  Any use of a civilian infrastructure to launch bombs is itself a war crime."    That Hamas bears legal responsibility for the harm to civilians in areas from which it fires is enshrined throughout international law, he said: "In the general principles of customs binding on nations, in the specific international law of armed conflict [also called] international humanitarian law, in the Fourth Geneva Convention, in decisions of the International Court of Justice and the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda - it's all set out there."    Third, he explained, "the misuse and abuse of humanitarian symbols for purposes of launching attacks is called the perfidy principle.    "For example, using an ambulance to transport fighters or weapons or disguising oneself as a doctor in a hospital, or using a UN logo or flag, are war crimes."    The fourth violation, "of which little has been made, is the prohibition in the Fourth Geneva Convention and international jurisprudence against the direct and public incitement to genocide.    "The Hamas covenant itself is a standing incitement to genocide.  [Similarly,] just before this fighting started, I saw Hamas leaders on television referring to Israel and Jews as the sons of apes and pigs."    The fifth crime relates to the scope of the attack on civilians, which upgrades the violation to a crime against humanity.  According to Cotler, "when you deliberately hit civilians not infrequently but in a systematic, widespread attack, that's defined in the treaty of the International Criminal Court and international humanitarian law as a crime against humanity."     The final war crime for which Hamas is responsible is the recruitment of children into armed conflict.    "Hamas is a case study of each of these six categories of war crime," said Cotler.  Unfortunately, the international community "has been minimizing the manner in which Hamas has engaged in consistent mass-violation of international humanitarian law." Cotler said specifically delineating Hamas's violations was important in that it would place the onus of responsibility for the civilian tragedy in Gaza on the proper party.    "The consequences [of the fighting] are tragic in human terms," he said.  "Clearly what is happening in Gaza is a tragedy.  But there has to be moral and legal clarity as to responsibility.    "When Israel responds and civilians are killed because Israel is targeting an area from which rockets were launched, then it is Hamas which bears responsibility for the deaths, and not Israel, according to international law."      .|`|9QBlKlFmaa	Israel withdrew from all its military forces from Gaza in 2005 and, since that withdrawal, Hamas launched more than 8,000 rockets intentionally aimed at civilians in Southern Israel. Thus, every launched rocket aimed at civilians is a war crime. Yet few, if any, human rights groups or UN leaders since the Gaza intervention have called for Hamas to be tried for war crimes.    Hamas used civilians and civilian locations in Gaza  schools, hospitals, and residential complexes  as shields behind which they launched their terrorist rockets. That, too, is indisputably a war crime. Hezbollah did the same thing from Lebanon. Yet again, there is only silence about Hamas and Hezbollah being prosecuted for war crimes.    Iran funds and supplies terrorist weapons to both Hamas and Hezbollah. Yet nations of Western Europe, many of which were the locations of recent street protests calling for prosecution of Israel for war crimes, have been active in trade and commerce with Iran, and seem strangely silent about criticizing Iran's funding of Hamas and Hezbollah terrorism.    It is a documented fact that Israel Defense Forces (IDF) continually tried to prevent civilian casualties while still defending themselves from these terrorist attacks. They sent tens of thousands of text messages and cellular phone calls to Gazans  to warn civilians to evacuate areas used by Hamas for launching rockets; they called off attacks when they saw Hamas pushing women and children up front as shields; and they used targeted weapons and "smart" bombs to avoid civilian casualties as best as they could.     Yet when the IDFs weapons unintentionally caused civilian deaths, leaders of the United Nations and human rights" groups call for war crimes investigations. And there are few, if any, counter voices challenging the United Nations at least to be even-handed and demand war crimes investigations of Hamas and Hezbollah. (including the Secretary General, who has not been hesitant to criticize Israel but strangely silent about Hamas).     Then there is the accusation that Israel committed war crimes by using excessive force and causing disproportionate civilian deaths compared to the number of Israelis who died due to Hamas rockets.    What would have been the reaction of most Americans (or most of the civilized world, for that matter) if someone had made the charge that the U.S. and its military forces were guilty of war crimes after Sept. 11, 2001, because, while bombing Al Qaeda and the Taliban government harboring them in Afghanistan, excessive numbers of civilians were tragically but inadvertently killed  because the number killed exceeded the 3,000 people who died on 9/11?    I suggest the reaction would have been, universally, that is nuts.          .|`|3WOpHPujaa	The criminal acts are on the part of Hamas.    "If terrorists win there [Israel], the terrorists will be on our doorstep next.  We are all engaged collectively in trying to stop terrorism...  If Hamas wanted to really make a difference for the Palestinian people, they would work hard in rebuilding Gaza and not work hard on trying to destroy Israel and kill innocent people.  This is one of those clear-cut cases." - Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York City.    French public television network France 2 revealed on 13 January 2009 that they had aired photographs that allegedly showed destruction caused by the Israel Air Force during Operation Cast Lead, which were in fact taken during a different incident in 2005, one in which Gaza civilians were killed by an explosion caused by their own terrorists in the Strip.    The UN and the mainstream media are wailing and accusing Israel of war crimes after the IDF returned fire at a UN school from which Palestinians were firing mortars.  The explosives and booby traps installed in the school by Hamas then blew up.    They have no right to complain when Israelis return fire and the building explodes.  Where were the UN personnel as Hamas operatives brought in the explosives and installed the booby traps?  Were they preventing or, most likely, helping Hamas to set up the explosives - even if only by inaction and ignoring Hamas' activities?    Hamas puts Gaza civilians at risk.  The Israel Defense Forces issued a news release saying paratroopers found a map that "describes the location of explosive devices and firing positions in the middle of the civilian population in the dense neighborhood, which endanger the life of the civilians."    This is the big difference.  The American and the English did not use terror tactics, and they did not intentionally endanger their own civilians, nor the enemies' civilians.|`|96a57ea9f1bc612b27a5f5a92d88468faa	Sadly until the Gaza people reject the Hamas murder group they will never have peace. Having a terrorist government is never sensble.

rYCdY9veaa	Well I live in Rome, and I can say that problems are mostly given by gipsies: they're really "invading" our city, roman people and italian people in general are becoming xenophobic because of the frequent thefts and rapes they do. So the first suggest I can give you is: pay attention to your bags and pockets while travelling and being at the station, and while visiting Rome's center and most visited places. Pay also attention to the prices when you enter a restaurant, specially in visited places: there are a lot of restaurants wich have very expensive prices due to the fact that chiefly tourists eat there; so before entering a restaurant look at the menù (generally exposed outdoor). As it's been said already, pay attention to the taxi, specially from airport to your hotel. It's true, policeman here are racist, so you won't have big problems with documents and stuffs like that. But be careful if you want enjoy a joint on the streets, policeman will not close their eyes... <br>  Pay attention while on underground, most part of people is robbed there. But don't think that Rome is a particularly dangerous city, the situation is the same all over Europe. Here you'll also find very welcoming people, good food and wine, and all kind of comfort and pleasure that a city can offer, in addition to the wonderful location you can be in; and finally don't think that Rome is a  boring city: it can offers a lot of nocturne enterteinments, specially in Testaccio and Trastevere districs.Don't forget to visit them by night.<br>  I hope to have been of help, and that you'll spend fantastic time here in Rome. Good holiday.<br>  Giacomo|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Well. I went there this summer, and I'll tell you what I did.<br>  <br>  I didn't carry a purse or any bag (but seeing as you're male, idk if that should be a problem lol) Instead I put all my train tickets or whatever ect ect money, passport, in a thing called a necksafe, and i tucked it down my shirt....it makes you look funny but no one will try to steal it then...and if they do...well...it will be more difficult.<br>  <br>  Also just keep aware of your surroundings. There are alot of gypsies that will try to distract you with there products and then steal something off of you.<br>  <br>  Never get distracted. <br>  <br>  But it's really not that bad. I hope you enjoy your time in Rome!!!|`|1Vih78dZaa	Rome is not a particularly dangerous place but, like all big cities, you can encounter problems if you don't pay attention to what's going on around you and don't think about what you're doing.<br>  <br>  I believe that the biggest danger in Rome is so-called petty crime: pickpocketing, purse snatching and minor scams. I speak from personal experience when I say that even such relatively trivial things can really put a damper on one's enjoyment of a holiday.<br>  <br>  The two pieces of advice I give everyone I know who tells me that they're visiting Rome are:<br>  <br>  1) Never get in a taxi unless it's a white car with the crest of Rome prominently displayed on the front door and a meter on the dashboard. Any other sort of cab will be illegal and you will – at the very least – get charged a rip-off fare.<br>  <br>  2) Always be very alert to the danger of pickpockets. If ANYONE touches you – EVER – no matter what the excuse, assume that the toucher or an associate will be going for your wallet or other valuables. If your hotel room has a safe, use it to store credit cards and cash you will not need on your day out. Take a photocopy of your passport with you and some other sort of photo ID since the police have the right to demand that you identify yourself, but leave your passport in the safe as well. If you have to carry a credit card, make sure you also have the number you phone to report a stolen card so that you can deal with that immediately. Think carefully about displaying expensive cameras, mobile phones and other small, consumer electronics. If you're travelling with another person or persons, think about how you can arrange yourselves when you're walking so that the pockets or bags with money and other valuables are between the two of you, rather than on the outside.<br>  <br>  It might all sound a bit paranoid, but it's really just a matter of thinking about the fact that there are predators out there who are very good at doing their nefarious job and you need to take that into account if you want to have a positive visit.|`|Dn63VUsVaa	Don't convert loads of money before your trip and carry it all with you.

AA10353250	The the two leading strip bars are: Le Palace, across from the Executive Hotel and Elite on Calle Cinquenta (50th Street.<br>  <br>  The Le Palace has the usual format girls dance individually but with their own original addition. The girls come out on the stage in a group and sashay around.<br>  <br>  The Elite club does pretty much the same thing format as in the USA; the girls come out in a skimpy bit of lingerie and dance, then remove something, dance some more, remove more dance a bit and are GONE!  Wait, was that nude?  Yes she was Se?or.  Don't blink.<br>  <br>  But it does no good to depend on hearsay in Panama because things change so fast here.<br>  <br>  At either place, as soon as you sit down,you will be warmly greeted by a waitress who will take your drink order. <br>  Then you will be even more warmly greeted by an even more attractive "hostess" who will cuddle with you as long as you continue to quench her thirst.<br>  <br>  The hostess will grease the skids for you if you want a private nude dance - just keep yo' hands to yo'self.<br>  <br>  Both places require an entry fee.  At Elite you can choose the open bar, where you get all you want for a flat fee. <br>  That's the way to go if you can regulate yourself - hard to do <br>  <br>  Both of these places are in safe neighborhoods, where you can walk around at night and not worry about nothing more than a taxi driver looking for a fare.<br>  <br>  However if you go to the Crystal Moon, very similar to Le Palace, you need to get there and leave by taxi.  It is a large garrish place with several rooms all furnished by a color blind interior designer and frankly, the girls are not all that gorgeous.  Elite and Le Palace are better for that.

mx32BnQAaa	Sparta is in Greece in the southern part of the Peloponnese<br>   The battle at Thermopylae ended with every last Spartan fighting  with self sacrifice and bravery for until they were killed.<br>  <br>  Thermopylae is famous because of the doomed heroism of the troops, who against appalling odds, remained at the pass and has inspired much praise:<br>  <br>      ...the fairest sister-victories which the Sun has ever seen, yet they would never dare to compare their combined glory with the glorious defeat of King Leonidas and his men[103]<br>  <br>  A second reason is the example it set of free men, fighting for their country and their freedom, and what they might thereby achieve:<br>  <br>      So almost immediately, contemporary Greeks saw Thermopylae as a critical moral and culture lesson. In universal terms, a small, free people had willingly outfought huge numbers of imperial subjects who advanced under the lash. More specifically, the Western idea that soldiers themselves decide where, how, and against whom they will fight was contrasted against the Eastern notion of despotism and monarchy — freedom proving the stronger idea as the more courageous fighting of the Greeks at Thermopylae, and their later victories at Salamis and Plataea attested.[10]<br>  <br>  Militarily, the fame of Thermopylae is also justified, on the basis of the first two days fighting. The performance of the defenders is used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers~<br>  <br>  It is one of the most important parts of history if not the first!~|`|YU471WSsaa	christopher ? i dont know what you are on about ...but  to the questioner... i would laugh at you to of what you asked your professor... ..you say professor  are you in  college or university? some thign dosent add up here!!..either your dumb as hell or your trying to put one over us? WHAT THE HELL DOES SPARTA HAVE TO DO WITH WORLD WAR 1?  do you realize  historically speaking how dumb that is! especially to a PROFFESSOR..of HISTORY i presume no wonder he asked you  "WHAT CLASS DO U THINK THIS IS"  ok just in case your being really stupid or you have no idead or trying to put one over us... FOR YOUR INFORMATION .....HISTORY IS DIVIDED IN 2 PARTS...  (ANCIENT HISTORY) and (MODERN HISTORY)  sparta belongs to the ancient history. got that!.. world war 1 belongs to modern history ok got that!....  they have nothing in common..unless you where discussing military tactics of ancient sparta compared to modern world war 1 war fare.. that would be the only situations or to comapre militray leaders of the ancient world to the modern world...  YOU SAY LOCATION yes you are right both sparta and world war 1  are and happend in EUROPE,,but the location  HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH SUBJECT AS I SAID ONE BELONGS TOT EH ANCIENT WORLD THE OTHER BELONGS TO THE MODERN WORLD..no wonder your confussed and the professor was dumb founded with your question.... i mean really didnt you learn the diffrence abotu modern and ancient history? at school? i find that hard to belive..i would give you full credit only if your question was to comapre ancient with modern yes then you are right..but to assume that sparta  was associated with world war 1 is realy really dumb..|`|AA11589437	Sparta is in Greece, hence in Europe.<br>  However, the role of Sparta was important in antiquity, about 2300-2400 years before the time of WW1 that you are studying. If you like it so much, visit Greece and have a tour of the PEloponnese, you will visit these locations personally. It is thrilling to see the actual places.<br>  <br>  Oh, just an addition to the info you got above, which is correct. Spartans did fight with heroism and self-sacrifice, but they had no other choice either, because their laws were saying they could never desert a battle, even if it was obviously lost. Apart from them, however, Thespians and Plataians also stayd and died, although they had no such laws. Finally, this brave but useless sacrifice did not stop the Persians however. Once again, the Athenians were the ones who defeated the Persians and destroyed their fleet. Even the Persian king had to go back to Persia on foot and incognito. It was the Atyhenians who saved the entire western world from Persians in the battle of Marathon (490 BC) and the naval battle of Salamis (480BC).|`|2dWlUEimaa	Sparta is located in the central-south part of the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece, which is in southeastern Europe. Sparta was only really relevant historically speaking in ancient times. Generally you study Sparta in an Ancient History or World Civilizations class. A class on Eastern Europe most likely will focus on Russia, the Balkans, the Baltic Countries, and the countries between those regions from around the Middle Ages to the present.<br>  <br>  So, you shouldn't feel dumb, because TECHNICALLY you are right in that Sparta is located in [south]eastern Europe. However, you should probably read the class description better next time so you have a general idea of what the class will cover. The professor was a jerk to laugh at you!

2UDbOpxTaa	I live in Abergavenny which is just down the road from Chepstow, and I have friends in Chepstow. There's not an awful lot to do, unless you like walking in which case it's great. But it's a very safe, nice area for bringing up kids. I don't know about any specific schools in Chepstow but generally most of the schools around here are good, nothing dangerous or awful! I'd stay away from schools in Newport and Pontypool (as I say, there's nowhere truly awful but these are probably the least good in the area). Chepstow has a lovely little town with some nice shops and a castle but nothing extensive. In my experience the people, houses, buildings, etc are all very nice.<br>  In summary, its a safe, nice area, though if you're looking for somewhere lively and full of shops and things to do, it's not really so much about that.

Wear what you would want to wear to the mall e.g. [shorts, tank top, halter, jeans, skirts, shirts]. I would suggest to bring a lot of shorts because here in the summer it can get pretty hot. I would also bring a fair amount of jeans, long sleeves, jackets, because it can get pretty chilly and rainy sometimes. For footwear, its pretty much anything. Slippers, or some people call them "flip-flops", sneakers, boots, heels, sandals, anything. It's casual though, so I wouldn't wear a lot of fancy clothes to school, save that for parties and going out! The average girl would wear a tank-top or shirt and shorts or jeans with slippers, casual.      Have fun at UH! [:  and hope this helps.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	There is no dress code, but don't be slutty.

hPY4VbIWaa	Hmmm.  I know a bit about this, seeing as I was TRYING to get to Seoul for the Mirotic concerts, so I looked it all up a few weeks back.  ^_^    1.  I'm afraid I don't know the minimum age to travel without an adult.  I think it varies on different airlines, some would probably be ok with it, others wouldn't.  Do you speak Korean?  Would you really want to go to Korea on your own?? I would be scared to death, heh heh!  I was gonna go with a friend.    2.  Dunno about average price, but the hotels I looked at were pretty cheap.  The exchange rates between South Korean Won and the pound are still pretty good, which is nice.  It depends on the size of room, too.  I looked in a pretty posh hotel and it was going to be about 600,000 won for two nights for a two-person room.    Don't panic though!  600,000 won comes out at about 300, believe it or not.  Given that that was for two people for two nights, it would be about 75 for one person per night, and that's cheap for a good hotel.    3.  The best concert tickets were 77,000 won, that was for standing right next to the stage or seats with a great view.  That's about 40, so once again, Korean stuff is CHEAP, yay!  XD  The trouble is, you can't BUY the concert tickets without a Korean ID number, and you need to be Korean to have one of those.  This was my problem!  If you have no ID like me, and have to try and buy from an aucton site afterwards, you are looking at struggling with Chinese/Japanese auction sites, and tickets being sold for WAY over twice their original price.  We're talking people bidding several hundred pounds per ticket.    4.  I don't know if you looked at the prices of plane tickets?  Because they can be pretty scary.  You need to book far in advance or you're looking at over 1000 for a return ticket.  o_O     ...I hope that has helped a bit!!!  My email is on my profile if you have any more questions!  ^____^    I would love to go to Korea to see DBSK too, maybe we should just grab them and bring them to the UK...
WZgcnVanaa	if you are in school, maybe you can see if there are travel options with your foreign language teachers, or even a travel club.  even if your school doesn't offer anything like that, another may.  when my french teacher was in high school, her school didn't offer any travel options to students, but a school just down the road did, so she tagged along with them.  educational tours like that are pretty good, and the pricing is usually a bargain too.  a trip to france (depending on where you live) can be anywhere from $2000 to $3000 with an educational tour group, depending on which company you go with.  if you go with a tour group like this, you get lots of things included (hotels paid for, meals paid for, tickets for attractions paid for, a tour guide who knows the language, etc.) so you know you won't be left high and dry.  i can understand why your dad may not want to take the whole family to france...it's expensive to go, and simply may not be interested.  but if you are interested, and you can convince your parents about it, and you can go yourself.  when i went, my parents split the cost of the trip itself, and i got a job and earned my spending money, since you will need a couple hundred dollars (depending on how long you go) to spend on souvenirs, lunch, and "just in case" money.      as for the weather, i've only ever been to france in the summer, and the weather was nice.  however, when we went to mont st. michel (extreme north of france) it was rainy and cold for june, but it didn't bother me.    honestly, any time you go to france is a great time.  if you get an opportunity to go any time, take advantage of it.  just beware, if you go once, it's addictive, and you'll want to go again.  good luck and i hope you get there!|`|cChQmoiKaa	Where does he want to go?

You must be CORRECTABLE (sorry, I can't italicize it) up to 20-20|`|yY6WOKLxaa	yeah.  that or contacts.|`|NFkGrcG9aa	If you go to the Air Force Academy for College you won't need 20/20 vision and this is your best chance.  They award more fighter slots to Academy graduates than other people in pilot training.  These requirements change with their need for pilots.  Your vision has no affect on your ability to be a great aviator.  Its a bit of a myth.      Do  not enter the Air Force enlisted as very few get to be officers let alone pilots (most enlisted people who become officers go to munitions and supply)  Your second choice is ROTC which you can do at most colleges.      Officer Training School is the most selective and has more restrictions.  Recruiters love to get to you sign up to be a navigator and then train as a pilot.  Very few navigators become pilots    Good luck.
