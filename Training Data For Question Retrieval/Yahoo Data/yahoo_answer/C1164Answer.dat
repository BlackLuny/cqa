ZlfPl6B1aa	The BBB website might help..<br>  <br>  You need to let your mom know they aren't regulated by that..All should be inspected by the Health Inspector and you can get information on their violations at town hall.. When you go there make sure they have an auto clave or use disposable needles. They should use new ink pots for each customer..should be wearing gloves..should have disinfectants everywhere..<br>  <br>  In CT you must be licensed to do tattoo work & also piercing work..<br>  <br>  Ask around to people and see what their experiences are.<br>  <br>  I also live in CT, but idk what part your in.....otherwise i'd tell you to go to Valle's in Danbury or Labor of Love in Brewster, NY..
AA11461724	no. it says not to use on children because a child's skin along with scalp is much more sensitive than an adults, especially a 4 year old. bad news. especially black hair. black hair takes 40 volume peroxide to be lightened to yellow, then you will need do do something else to it to get it white, possibly bleached AGAIN or toned, which takes 20 volume peroxide. 20 volume with bleach on black hair would turn it a dark orange, it wouldn't work and it would injure his scalp or possibly make his hair fall out. please don't do it

So it depends how the person pierces it.  If it's fast then it wont hurt.|`|s0lcBI5baa	If you are talking about a belly button piercing, they don't hurt to be honest with you, But if you are talking about a surface piercing,then that's a whole different story. <br>  <br>  But at the same time, it does depend on the person. I, myself has my septum pierced, I know many people who have passed out from it, and I didn't think it hurt one bit! But when I had my lip pierced, OMG! I thought that was the worst! <br>  <br>  So like I said, it depends on the person. But I also say, if you want it, go for it! No Pain, No Gain!|`|Izqfjhidaa	okay i got mine done and honestly it doesn't hurt at all.<br>  i felt the needle go through but it didn't hurt, it may be different<br>  for you though because i also just pierced my upper lip by myself<br>  and that didnt hurt either. but i have figured out for myself that<br>  the more scared i am the less it hurts... for all things.<br>  you might feel a pinch but its 2 seconds out of your life.<br>  it will get sore and hurt a little for a couple days after wards though.<br>  good luck.,|`|dHkvVlONaa	Mine barely hurt at all, like about a 3.<br>  <br>  It hurt more the second time though, because of the scar tissue and what not.  <br>  <br>  But it also depends on like if your fat or not, because if it goes through muscle it is going to hurt more.|`|pgmXNpuOaa	by your tummy im guessing you mean your bellybutton?<br>  <br>  <br>  its probably a 4 or 5 on 1-10<br>  <br>  for me at least but it wasnt anything bad|`|QVqritp7aa	Oh geez, the shape that your belly is in has NOTHING do do with it. Your belly button is only skin. I would give it a 6 out of 10. You're only in pain for about 10 secondes. They'll pierce your belly button with the needle and leave it in for a sec, then follow through with the barbell (I would recommend a barbell anyways). Doesn't really hurt afterwards...you'll be just fine!<br>  <br>  Please make sure the place you're going is sterile...just make them show you the packaged instruments (the fact that you're going somewhere that you don't have to be 18 is a little troublesome).|`|Nupv5Uzlaa	That depends on the amount of fat on your belly.<br>  <br>  For instance, I worked out and had a tight, firm belly.<br>  Therefore, the needle was quite hard to push through and caused unwanted pain.<br>  VVV<br>  <br>  The shape that your belly is in DOES have something to do with it, the piercer said so himself.<br>  <br>  If it has nothing to do with it, then why did my TIGHT belly have a problem? Whereas a fat one wouldn't go through the same ordeal.<br>  <br>  THINK.|`|s5baMP5Yaa	i have to say it is a 0 for pain. There is no pain it is more like a pressure when it comes out the other end.

liHpJvVfaa	If I was you I would really go to a salon. You may make it look worse cutting it yourself. That is the only way to fix the problem is by continuing to get it trimed.|`|f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Why not let a professional trim your ends? This is like cleaning your home before the cleaning lady comes because you're so embarassed with how dirty it looks, lol. Doesn't make sense. Hair dressers have probably seen it all - overprocessed hair, bad dye jobs, bad hair cuts, torchured ends, etc. So, seeing your hair wouldn't be a surprise to them because they've probably seen worse. Just go to the salon and tell them that you haven't been taking good care of your hair in the past and want to turn over a new leaf and you've stopped doing all these damaging things to it. The hairdresser will understand and you might even get advice on how to care for your hair. <br>  <br>  If not a professional then seek out a local hair school - if there's one in your area. They can give you a trim for a really cheap price. Or, if you don't want that option then see if a friend or family member will be willing to trim the splits. If all else fails, look on youtube and look up some trimming tutorials for curly hair and this should help you. <br>  <br>  It'll start getting longer once you cut the splits. Splits cause breakage if they're left unatteneded. THey also travel up the hair shaft so you'll end up cutting your hair shorter to completely get rid of it. <br>  <br>  BTW, cutting an inch or two every month to guard against splits ends doen't make any sense. You're hair will not grow because you'll be cutting off the new growth! After you get rid of the split ends then I would suggest cutting your hair ONLY when you see splits, other than that it doesn't make sense to cut perfectly healthy hair that does not have splits. You are trying to let your hair grow aren't you? Hair grows on average 1/2 inch per month, or 6 inches per year. Keep this in mind if you decide to needlessly trim your hair because you might be negating your new growth and your hair will be at the same place (length) it's at right now. <br>  <br>  I'm happy for you that you've resolved to have healthier hair and good luck.|`|zxbuC5Pwaa	run a search on <a href="http://dwarfurl.com/de82b." rel="nofollow">http://dwarfurl.com/de82b.</a>|`|ek1193Qiaa	then get a hairstylist to cut about an inch or two off the bottom and then treat it with hydrating conditioners and heat protecting sprays<br>  <br>  when im in the shower i use conditioner to take out all of my knots and then i wash it out and then i put more just on top of my hair and leave it in until right before i get out the shower. That's when i wash it out and it moisturizes your hair very nicely.|`|Nuuk1Nwtaa	Cut about an inch and a half off your ends. Every two months or so, cut an inch or half inch off the ends--this will prevent your hair from getting more and it will actually make it grow faster.|`|PfIywLLyaa	Cut off the ends -  it will just continue to break if you don't and it will not grow.|`|jYQxGhSuaa	They are just split ends. I would buy Dove repairing shampoo or other kinds of repairing shampoo. Instead of just getting a trim i would get four or five inches cut off if it is long. Go somewhere cheap like Master Cuts they don't care about the condition of your hair. Then just get a trim every two months and it will grow back healthy. Use protection spray on your hair before you straighten it and it will keep it healthy and shiny.|`|Nt69zBpbaa	Hi. <br>  This happens to me all the time. I curl my hair and it seems to make it worse. Just get a trim and limit the straightening, curling, blow-drying, and other things that damage the hair.

It seems gross, but it might help!<br>  :-)|`|nXfkUUozaa	You need to go to the salon. The stylists there have seen the worst of hair, and I'm sure your problem is not the worst they've ever seen.

Hair is already dead material, as much as you hydrate there is nothing you can do to make it healthy again. But you can help with limiting the damage with the care products you are using now. My guess is that your hair will continue breaking for a while until it grows out. I suggest you get it trimmed too, or the split ends will spread up and it will cause more damage. Wait for your hair to grow, it will eventually. It grows about and inch every couple months.|`|d2FwRqcVaa	Get it cut!

Yes you can use gel liner on your water line.<br>  2. You can put eye liner:<br>  On your water line<br>  Lower lash line<br>  Top lid behind lashes <br>  The corner of the outter eye (Some people do, not always, for cat eyes and little flicks)<br>  Inner corner of the eye near the tear duct (People go round with the eye liner to get the full effect)<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Natalie x|`|jx6L5t3Paa	1. Yes, but I wouldn't recomend it, because it makes your eye look messy. <br>  <br>  You can use eyeliner anywhere around your eye, it really depends on the shape of your eye. If you have round eyes its best to use a little on the bottom of your eye and maby even a little bit past the eye ( like towards your cheek bone, but obviously not out that far!) <br>  <br>  Using pencil eye liner works best, gels and liquid liner work best only if you smudge it with a brush that are sold on some more expensive eye liners, but if you use pencil you can also rub it a little to make a "smokey" look.|`|VYvpDsDIaa	what is a water line ?|`|EL45UeUJaa	1. Yeah you can use it, but be careful, most liquid or gel eyeliners run into your eyes if you use it on the lower waterline. So put it as close to the lashline by your waterline as possible. <br>  <br>  2. You can have it on your top lid, like a thin line. You can put it on your top lid like higher and thicker. I also put it on my top waterline, below my eyelashes to define my eye. Your lower waterline, some people do actually put it below their lower lashline.|`|1Hx7MFUvaa	You can use gel eyeliner on your water line. Don't be confused about eyeliner-there are a few different ways that can wear it. For a more natural look-wiggle the eyeliner right between your upper lash line. Get it as close into the lashes as possible. Don't worry about making a straight line across your lid. You're basically dotting the eyeliner into your lashes. Then you can make it thicker for more of a dramatic look. On the bottoms I find it depends what your eyeshape is. If your eyes are more rounded, then you can do it under the water line. My eyes are more almond shaped and it looks better if I do my eyeliner on the water line. Then I take an eyeshadow of the same shade and trace the waterline so that it softens it and makes it look a little more smokey. I do not recommend only putting eyeliner on the bottoms of your eye because it'll make your eyes look tired and darker.
ttIofRlBaa	i have stretch marks along my side. apparently bio oil is meant to reduce them but when i went to the doctor they said no that there is no magic cream for it and it will just fade with time, but its worth a go right? also i've heard palmers cocoa butter works well x|`|qHzq6ta2aa	Shea butter is great...|`|DsNEpN95aa	The stretch marks are formed due to fast growth of skin in a certain area that exceeded it's "elasticity". They are usually very hard to get rid of. There are surgical methods, lotions and cream, and diet/exercising. <br>  <br>  I know that surgeries are expensive, but they probably have the best effect depending on the place you go to. <br>  <br>  Lotion and cream are at more reasonable prices, but need to be used at a regular basis for a certain period of time. Then maybe they will become less noticeable. You can try Palmer's Cocoa butter formula w/ Vitamin E-concentrated cream. It should heal and softens rough, dry skin and it smoothes marks and tones skin. These kind of creams can be purchased at drugstores.<br>  <br>  Diet and exercising are healthy ways to lose weight, but they might not necessarily help to get rid of stretch marks. Make sure you don't exercise too much, slowly work your way up, or else extreme weight loss can cause more stretch marks.|`|AA11745375	coco butter is the best for it. its the number one thing that people who have had kids use. and if it gets rid of there stretch marks im sure it will get rid of any stretch marks =]|`|EAlc2Sw1aa	I gave my mom a lot of stretch marks lol.

I have pale skin as well and finding a shade can be troublesome, but not with this line! You just have to find out whether you have cool, neutral, or warm undertones.<br>  <br>  Do you get the most compliments and look the best when you wear clothes that are blues, purples, and pinks (jewel tones)? Then you are a cool skintone.<br>  <br>  Do you get the most compliments and look the best when you wear clothes that are golds, reds, and oranges, and browns (earth tones)? Then you are a warm skintone.<br>  <br>  Not sure? Maybe you are both- a neutral skintone. You can always test a bit in the store. Test it on your jawline so bring a compact!<br>  <br>  Now that you know your skintone, pick a dark or lighter shade depending on how dark or light your skin is. Since you are fair, pick a number 1, 2, or 3. Check them out when you get in the store. In conclusion, if you are very fair and a cool skintone (like me) you will be a C1. Get it? Just check them out when you get to the store.<br>  <br>  Now that you know your shade, let me tell you about the foundation. It's a really good starter foundation because the shade matches perfectly if you get the right one- and it goes on smoothly. Apply it with your fingers or a damp makeup sponge (those little triangle wedges). Damp means you wet it, then squeeze it to get out excess water. The foundation is only $10.99 which is a good price for its quality.<br>  <br>  Try using blue as an eyeliner/eyeshadow shade! Brown eyeliner pops blue eyes, so consequently, blue should pop brown (or gold, hazel, etc.)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|74QD2tyXaa	Ok for the foundation, MAC is probably the best foundation you can get, it's light and creamy and you cant feel it on your face, I reccomend you try some testers out on your hands to find your skintone. When your putting the foundation on DO NOT use your hands! Because if theres any dirt or oil on your hands that will be mixed in with the foundation and you'll end up with spots.<br>  <br>  Now for the eyeshadow - <a href="http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Articles/4773481/colorwheel_Full.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ehow.com/images/GlobalPhoto/Art...</a>  <br>  <br>  That is the eyeshadow colourwheel. You find the colour closest to your eye colour and the colour opposite to it would look great.|`|AA11332651	If you have an uneven skin tone, Almay Perfect Match (The stuff that starts out white) is your best bet. The mousse stuff tends to be really thick an cakey, whereas Perfect match is really light, and always matches your skin tone. I also recommend using loose powder to set your makeup (make sure you tap off any excess to avoid looking fake) and a pressed powder for touch-ups during the day. Clean and Clear oil blotting sheets before touch ups keep your skin looking clean and keep makeup from building up. Hazel eyes look great with green, brown, Violets, and other neutral colors. If you're going out, use a vibrant blue in the crease of your eye and greys on your eyelid and brow bone to balance it out. :)|`|d09f570877bcea55a8ab8640d6b86637aa	for foundation, i would suggest maybelline liquid mineral foundation, its not too heavy and has a light coverage so it would even out the skintone<br>  or, there is a mineral powder from collection 200o in superdrug. it is called perfecting minerals<br>  these are really good and work well on their own as well as over foundation<br>  <br>  for the eyes, i would use blye - when your eyes are looking green<br>  use green when they are looking brown<br>  and also gold eyeshadows are great for hazel eyes<br>  or any eye colour tbh<br>  <br>  id just stick to a few colours<br>  and black also makes any eyecolour stand out<br>  <br>  if you are wanting to experiment with eye liner/shadow colours, just search on youtube for makeup tutorials<br>  they have everything on there, from basics on applying all the essentials, to how to do the most complicated looks<br>  <br>  <br>  have fun<br>  <br>  xxx

I bought a wallet there for about $11, and it has a black designer-look print, and its soooo cute! they also have cute tees, hobo bags, and other accessories. I know wal-mart's kinda lame, too, but their stuff isnt too bad, either. They have a huge purse aisle (near socks, usually).|`|5qTqn9Kcaa	I agree, Forever 21. You can shop online.

BvjPU3wkaa	Rimmel's Sexy Curves is better in my opinion.  The Lash Stiletto was great on length but gave zero volume.|`|cQNOWMktaa	Rimmel's mascara gives volume, and the lash stiletto gives length.<br>  You choose, or mix both formulas. <3|`|EL45UeUJaa	Lash stiletto :D It really volumized my lashes :D|`|YhjTbSmDaa	Sexy Curves.<br>  <br>  Rimmel London's Glam Eyes is fantastic, in my opinion.<br>  Its good for seperating lashes.
95Y7vIiJaa	well if its black then you just have to wait till it grows out, because if you try to put any color on there it will only make it darker. so maybe try color opps it will strip down all the color shes ever done but make sure you read the directoins carefullyy !|`|e193294baa8d6ba952ee479ba5e75b52aa	Id cut off as much hair as posible my sister dyed her hair black and wants it back so she chemicaly stripped it|`|TVkK1GUKaa	i think a multi color hair Style will look nice on her .|`|yhcyvBOHaa	IT IS BETTER|`|awETDHnnaa	good idea<br>  <br>  it should look okay
B29boGPcaa	St. Ive's Collagen Elastin moisturizer, it's only $5 for a huge tub, you only need to use a little bit and it works really well and I use it before applying make up. It's meant for tightening skin for older women, but I'm a teen and it makes my foundation and concealer go on smoother and look more natural. :) xx<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ARJsJSHoL._SL500_AA280_.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41...</a>|`|UQN3z7lMaa	Theres really a lot you could do. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several products.This is a good review website at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and read the reviews.|`|KxqEYBWhaa	i would think it would be ok to use. But you know what you should get as a moisturizer...the baby aveeno lotion. It's like 5 bucks and it should last you a while.|`|eH8c068yaa	I use Cetaphil moisturizer...it is made for sensitive skin and is noncomedogenic (which means it won't clog pores) and lasts all day...don't ever buy a "tub" of it, because bacteria from your hands can build in there...get the pump...hope this helps!!|`|2YzZ7DWoaa	Don't use body lotion for your face. Chances are it will clog your pores majorly! Aveeno has facial moisturizer though, so try that!
dhN3srQbaa	DONT USE IT!  since its fake and probably not tested it could harm your eyes!  my cousin bought a fake mac eyeshadow off ebay acouple of weeks ago and after 1 time using it she got a stye in her eye plus an eye infection.
eN5xA6RKaa	its considered 2 piercings then. yes it will hurt more becasue its 2 piercings instead of 1. you can either get 2 seperate rings like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.bmezine.com/pierce/07-navel/A90208/high/fxw8-untitled-image.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmezine.com/pierce/07-navel/A...</a><br>  <br>  or whats called a belly button industrial, like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.bmezine.com/pierce/07-navel/A90223/high/fwul-double-navel.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmezine.com/pierce/07-navel/A...</a>|`|f3c8a5f174ca386a6855ce97b71adbfbaa	You're a girl right? Go with the top. Bottom looks weird to me. I've never heard of someone getting it straight through...?<br>  Anyway, I've got mine on the top and it looks super cute. =D|`|MRekIzQSaa	You can get both pierced, yes, and then buy belly button rings like a rod that can go through both piercings and go "straight through".<br>  <br>  I can't say it's going to hurt "more", but it's going to take more time, and it's going to be two separate piercings, so... it will hurt two times as opposed to one...|`|XaYHMNusaa	I have a standard navel piercing, but I think you can get what you're talking about.  The "bottom" piercing would be more like a surface piercing though [I think they have to do the "punch and taper" method].  I've seen navels w/ an "industrial" bar through the holes.
awETDHnnaa	herbal essenes or aussie|`|szYAHqwTaa	I use herbal Essenes or the aussie products. They come in a purple bottles. They give me the best curls and waves.|`|y914Xbmmaa	use a gel or serum... mousse will make it look darker, and crunchy! Try a serum... like john freda Or frizzee go to a sallys beauty store they have lots of stuff!
cpfcRw0Oaa	i would leave them alone, but if u want to darken them, i recommend adding very little dye and working your way up until u get the shade u want.

I think Red is more of your color :)|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	no offense but they're kinda boring. Maybe try a different top. But I do like the shorts in the first one the best so I'd go with that one.|`|QMYNU9uNaa	The first one is better because it has more colors. The colors are really cute and make it look more "beachy" and summery.|`|7nrhPCf0aa	The 1st one, but you should wear  a floral t instead|`|4QfyirQjaa	First one!|`|Uy33D507aa	the second one. the warmer colors look better with your scenish bangs and lowlights in ur hair. the first one is like ughhhh pink. but u would know best.|`|KXmMlqA9aa	Definatley the first one!

Why?  Because your shorts are at least a size too small.  Leave it to a teeny bopper to think shorter and tighter is the way to go.  It just makes you look chunky.  Wearing tiny shorts too small is a disaster.|`|7riQpOy7aa	i think if you wore the first one then you might want some different shorts and if you wore the second a floral top would go nicely|`|DdwI9e9Aaa	The first one. but possibly for the picture quality.|`|KooPOX2haa	Both look tacky.<br>  <br>  I'd try a more fashionable top and some jeans shorts.|`|zpH51WWHaa	i love the first one
B29boGPcaa	Covergirl concealers don't give good coverage. I have dark circles and acne scars, it just didn't cover them up. I use an Almay concealer stick. It blends nicely and covers really well.

pIvN6TY7aa	In the past, 'white lead' was an important ingredient in face powder, and similar cosmetics.  I think that in Ancient Egypt, a dark lead compound (antimony?) was also used to accent the eyes.  Very serious negative medical consequences.<br>  <br>  We know now how dangerous lead is, and its use is monitored and prohibited in most situations.  If any make up has lead in it, they're not going to publish it.|`|usShaZiQaa	just shop for it at whole food s if you want it to be organic or if you're trying to avoid animal testing. No, no lead.

XaYHMNusaa	-You can buy them online or at your piercer's shop.<br>  -Yes, you can shave.<br>  -Yes, they're notorious for getting infected and causing problems [mine didn't].<br>  -It's not advised to swim while they're healing [they can take up to a year to heal].<br>  -When you get it done, it's a quick pinch and then it's done.  Very bearable.<br>  -The cost varies from place to place.<br>  -Sea salt soaks are IDEAL [do not use Bactine, Neosporin, rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide].  H2O Ocean is good to have on hand when you can't do a soak.|`|STLYxP39aa	It barely hurts.. The pain is really nothing and only for a second.<br>  It can cost anything from $35 and up.<br>  The healing time varies between people, but usually 8-12 weeks.|`|9JccdA9Uaa	Yes they hurt but only for a second or two. So you have to decide whether its worthit to you or not. Some people will tell you it doesnt hurt...but it does. How could it not. Im 27 and ive had mine done since was 16. Ive had to get it redone 3 times. (long story) last time was because i had my daughter and i had to take it out while i was pregnant. It left such a scar from being stretched out (because it was a hole) it left a mark. So i got it repierced...ANYWAY to answer your questions yes it hurts, um..why do you shave your belly? i guess if you have to you have to...it shouldnt get in the way. yes they get infected if you do not clean them properly. Your piercing will get pulled and stuff because of your clothes/jeans so be careful of that. constant pulling could cause irritation. yes swimming is fine. clean it with teatre oil. NOT ALCOHOL! good luck.<br>  Once you get it and its healed they are cute and fun! enjoy
f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Stop putting so much stock in your hair. Your hair does not make you who you are, but you're letting it control you. I used to be the same way. If my hair was not how I wanted it and I felt ugly then I was in a bad mood because of it. You shouldn't let your hair control how you feel about yourself.

MyzuQN9maa	You cant use any hot appliances on this type of wig. It will melt.<br>  I can tell you how to reform it though.<br>  Roll the wig in the shape you want it on plastic rollers .Make sure that it is perfectly smooth around the rollers. <br>  Boil water in a large stock pot. and dip the wig in there for about 5 to 10 seconds. let it dry on a wig head, take the rollers out and comb it out the way tou want it.<br>  Hope that helps.<br>  BTW<br>  Been a stylist for 20 years. I know stuff!|`|NXcZ8Gkjaa	Hiya,<br>  <br>  Just rollers and spray really, the heat will damage the wig - only human hair wigs can be styled with heat although they're a lot more expensive.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps<br>  <br>  Chaz|`|DkkhIgcqaa	Ahaha you granny, you have a wig

Great working environment too.|`|uZsmAn96aa	I've heard that Aeropostale pays well, and the employee discount is pretty good, too. Hollister has a lofty employee discount, but not as good as Aero's.

UTwYbNLCaa	get the more expensive one<br>  it's actually cheaper because it has more perfume in it.<br>  if you weer to buy the roll on one and find out how many of them would equal the cost of the biggest one, it's be alooot more expensive then the bigg one.|`|1U04I2LJaa	The refill is almost the price of the big bottle. You might as well just save some more money and buy the actual perfume. The refill is a purse spray and about $50 and the 1.7 oz is $65. The small roll on is only $16.|`|sOkTUYq7aa	then get the cheaper one!<br>  Do they both smell the same?<br>  I think the refillable is better because you ca keep refilling it if you likeit instead of buying a whole new one
xTQrSpDzaa	It doesn't take a salon to shave a head bald does it?  Why not tell one of your friends you want to do it and then let him/her do it for you.<br>  <br>  Friends are much better at helping you do things than salonista.|`|tSWTIcOtaa	Well, if you really want to do it, the simplest answer is to...just do it. :) lol.<br>  Though, if I were you, I wouldn't go to the salon and pay to have it done.<br>  If you or your Dad owns a pair of beard clippers or an electric razor I would just use that.<br>  And really, the beauty of hair is is that if you don't like how your haircut turns out, it does grow back...you know? (:<br>  My suggestion if you want to do it and not be able to back out, just shave a big chunk of your hair off. Or start with a mohawk. The rest comes easy after that. lol.<br>  Good luck!??|`|xuodzaSBaa	Book a hair appointment; there's no backing out that way :)|`|sOkTUYq7aa	well if you really want to do it, you wouldn't back out.|`|c34c2236afd420be57992daf512144dbaa	Grave the nearest razor.

I'd shorten it to about right above your boobs and get tons of layers and get some side bangs too.

I'm not just saying it either.

God made you as He intends you to be.<br>  2. Even if you were the prettiest girl in the world, that wouldn't mean you're nice.<br>  3.

gfoxHuzlaa	when i had 12 (i have now almost 14) i had a very very flat belly, and it looked very weird.. and i saw lots of people in my age with lots of muscles, so, everyday i would get up really soon, i would run about two miles, and then when i get home i would make some crunches and then some pushups.. now i look really really good.. and i am a lot stronger.. try it.. its simple :D|`|Zlv8l75baa	The best way is to do crunches or sit ups every day. Don't expect super fast results, but if you work hard every day, you will see results (not a six pack, but toned).  I don't really believe in fake tans, but I've heard that the neutrogena tanners mixed with lotions are ok.|`|JyghcEWpaa	do sexy girl curl ups|`|zgDxpqRsaa	try buying seventenn mag. every month they post great tips on how to great great abs good luck|`|La9fanNbaa	Sorry people but all your answers are wrong. While technically sit-ups and said ab exercises will produce muscle... you will not "see" your abs until you reduce body fat. Now how much body fat you have to reduce is based upon genetics. I know some women that will see them at 20% and I don't see them until I hit 12% and almost in contest shape. <br>  I would advise doing a conjunction of cardio and weight training (with ab work) to reduce body fat and gain muscle at the same time. Since you are already in track you are on the right path! Eventually those abs will begin to poke through :)<br>  As far as tanning... tanning beds can be safer than the outdoors simply because it is a controlled environment. I would suggest doing a high pressure bed OR trying a spray/mystic tan. If you find the right place to do the spray tan you will be able to obtain a natural color... and it's much less damaging than the sun or tanning beds.|`|NrXDYAPGaa	Sit ups!!<br>  Don`t do a tanning bed! If you HAVE to tan, do it naturally, outside. But remember to wear sunscreen.|`|tEpR9kr1aa	If you have not gone through puberty yet you wont get it for another year. or just do sit ups and curls and planks.

rdB2Pbldaa	I have black hair, too! I tried to dye it an auburn color. It came out mostly black with a reddish tinge, like when I'm in the sunlight. So I called the professionals at Clairol, and they gave me some tips. Like, you should use more than one box of hair dye if your hair is thick or longer than shoulder length. The amount of dye you use to saturate your hair is more important than the time the dye stays in your hair before you wash it. Now my hair is a beautiful, very dark auburn. It looks like I have highlights, actually, but it looks very natural. Good luck!|`|O9DyUUdvaa	Well, it all depends on what brand of hair dye your are buying. If you do use a home kit, you should pay attention to some brands that have hair dye that can be made for balck or darker hair. I'm in love with  this brand that I used when I dyed my hair a nice, rich brown/caramel color when I had super black hair:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.shopping.com/xPO-L_Oreal_Loreal_Feria_Hi_Lift_Browns_Hair_Color_No_B61_Downtown_Brown_Hi_Lift_Cool_Brown_1_Each" rel="nofollow">http://www1.shopping.com/xPO-L_Oreal_Lor...</a><br>  <br>  Don't like the shade...just overlook this brand Loriel Feria's high lift brown collection, made for super dark hair.
WMdJLTjsaa	no, it doesn't look authentic or say it's authentic.

HXZhINbeaa	Theres really a lot you could do. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several products.I would check out the review site at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and read the reviews.|`|eH8c068yaa	I LOVE Philosophy's poreless flawless tinted spf...it is called The Supernatural and you can either buy it from their website or Sephora...I think maybe Nordstrom's carries it as well?  A little goes a long way and I usually wear it under a bit of mineral powder|`|WVnrjYnvaa	Tinted moisturizer, with SPF sunscreen in it.<br>  Its just like a moisturizer, but with a hint of colour.<br>  They work really well and dont feel heavy or yukky when its really hot.<br>  Hope that helped ?|`|qOVMZWMpaa	Try a tinted moisturiser.<br>  It evens out your skin tone and is actually good for your skin!<br>  :) <br>  <br>  xx|`|rR90iLB0aa	you could use mineral powder wit spf<br>  or tinted mousterizer-thats wat i use|`|CKCtfqpBaa	try a tinted moisterizer with SPF it clocks the sun and will even out your skin tone! :)|`|iYAUq0DWaa	Em tinted moistuiser if you want to even out skin tone?<br>  Sometimes I just use bronzer in the summer it accentuates a natural slight tan:D
zgDxpqRsaa	try mixing your hair with light brown high lights kind of a brown that almost looks red it would look cute or you could add a diff. shade of blonde to your hair|`|lSr7u0mSaa	a picture could help, lol. :)
24sK6L2uaa	A sea salt soak would probably help. 1/4 teaspoon sea salt (not table salt) for 8 ounces warm water. That should help.|`|rdp95817aa	use rubbing alchol it takes the infection off like on the 3rd day|`|9XRKUtBmaa	savlon or tcp

1f4c803984defdfd24e382289f4e3180aa	They are not long enough and may be growing in different directions. Also the hair is thicker than your average hair, or should I say more coarse. They are a little tougher to pull out.<br>  <br>  I have the same problems and resorted to tweezers. It's a pain but it works. I'm to the point I'm considering getting permanent hair removal on my face just so I don't have to deal with it any longer.|`|OZ2Gz3mDaa	The hairs on your chin are generally thicker and stronger than other parts of your face.  I've had my face (eyebrows, lip, chin) waxed many times, and I've had to have some of the chin hairs removed with tweezers.  Think of a man's beard - very thick hairs.|`|CxvhqTjnaa	ewww
9EVcTnUWaa	As some one who's going to be 54 you're not old. But if you're really afraid of wrinkles and other signs of aging than make sure that you use a sunscreen every day one that's at least a 15 if not higher.  Sun does more skin damage than any thing else except long term smoking.  So don't smoke and use sun screen daily and you won't have worry about wrinkles for at least 25 to 30 years.  And relax if you feel that you're old at 25 would you rather be dead?? Age is relative to how you feel about yourself.|`|GFYkV8a0aa	There's a new anti aging cream out now, that has the Acai Berry in it. It's supposed to work pretty good and it's all natural without any harmful effects.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below for more info.|`|BTrtEZESaa	I'm not sure what's good to use, but a heads up, don't use the Olay. My mom used it and it worked fine as a moisturizer but not for anti-aging like it said. And it ended up making her break out like crazy. But good luck!|`|uXFdeKGPaa	25 is young huni but if u want something that works go for this|`|HuJII67Haa	ur 25.....not very old there deary

Sv0SV0E1aa	With your gray- blue eyes, wear a dark midnight blue color eyeshadow with two coats of mascara. Remember to curl your lashes first. <br>  With your gray- green eyes wear smoky gray or olive green eyeshadow by blending it up all the way to the crease and then put black liquid liner on the top lashline and then line your lower lashline and then mascara. That'll really make your eyes pop.<br>  Good Luck and have fun!!!|`|nDxjnlN6aa	brown eyeliner. brown mascara. peach colored blush and a shimmery gold eyeshadow.<br>  also be sure to curl your lashes and add a clear lip gloss.|`|67wM6jM2aa	Well, depending on how your eyes are that day (my eyes are exactly the same!!)    ~~~~~<br>  <br>  Green-gray: Liner on the bottom, a Champagne color under your brow, and a light to medium brown on your lid.<br>  <br>  Blue-gray: Liquid liner(heavy-er line) on the top, A light pink under your brow, and a coffee color for your lid
RMppfinbaa	Green eyes: Earth tone colors will make your eye color stand out. Going darker creates a contrast making your eye color look dramatic. Tones would be brown, gold, sand, charcoal. Going with a green eye color or blue will just drown your eyes out and make them blend in. Not making them look as good as they could<br>  Clothes: When you're looking for clothes, it's the opposite. You want clothes that are teal or maroon. Those colors look great on blonds. Red would also look nice if you're headed for a night on the town. Try orange as well ( you'd be surprised how cute an orange polo like from Lacoste looks with a cute pair of skinny jeans and flats.) :D <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|JyghcEWpaa	blues and greens|`|qg1Cr7dAaa	Try Red or peach lipstick. beige foundation. Black, green or brown eyeshadow, plus brown eyeliner would look perfect.<br>  <br>  Clothes- go for dark colours, Red, black, navy blue, brown. dont go for white orange or yallow as they make yr skin colour looks more pale|`|SiaRRMJ2aa	You sound just like me :P .

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Try hot oil treatments with *natural* olive oil. Buy some extra virgin (or pure) olive oil at the grocery store; warm it in the microwave; massage it through your hair and scalp for about 5 minutes (or you can leave it in longer under a conditioning/shower cap or hooded dryer); rinse; shampoo/condition your hair like normal. I recently notice that out of all the hair products I have this is the ONLY thing that has actually improved the health of my hair. I try to do this every time I shampoo. You'll begin to notice improvements in your hair after awhile. Benefits I've noticed: Stronger hair, very shiny, extra curly, smoother and silkier strands. <br>  <br>  It is hard to get out all of the oil, though, but because of my hair type it doesn't bother me that some oil is still in my hair afterwards. The oil could make it harder for your regular conditioner to penetrate your strands though. I have the Wen cleansing conditioner and when I tried to cleanse my hair after the hot oil treatment I got a lot of it out, but I could tell the conditioner did not penetrate my strands as much as it usually does without the oil.|`|eBgrIgnzaa	cut your spilt ends, it will help it grow,conditioner your hair...try asking a cosomotologist what to do to your hair,or an hair doctor,i no when being black(no offense) you have to conditioner your hair,expecially when the weather is dry,you have to keep it greased,good luck|`|ShzRnJ2Baa	i would recommend Mane N' Tale, shampoo and conditioner for me it works and its cheap to you could buy it from walgreens|`|3TtAVcRIaa	just go to the store and look at all the things you see.<br>  look for a REALLY strong conditioner. it'll help repar it.<br>  and maybe get your hair trimmed a little.<br>  you might have split ends too.|`|sOkTUYq7aa	try head&shoulders<br>  if you want it to be repaired, just get your hair trimmed every month or so to keep it looking healthy.

7PFXTwscaa	The only sure way to get her what she really wants is to ask her! Then you'll know exactly what she wants :). If she gives vague answers or says she doesn't care, just look at what she already has and likes. Pay attention to what she usually wears and feels comfortable in, and get her something similar.

ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	You should be able to go a little lighter hand. Texture is more important on aging skin. You don't need to use more pale colors, just more sheer formulas.<br>  <br>  A fushia tint skillfully applied is much more natural than a thick opaque powder blush in a pale pink color.<br>  <br>  Focus on keeping your skin moist with creamy textures, and make sure to give your eyebrows a boost. Eye liner can be your best friend, but stay tight to the lashes.

UWTkdG6uaa	i know you said you couldn't get it done at the salon at the moment but i REALLY wouldn't suggest dying it yourself. i tried to go blonde before and my hair ended up a complete ginger mess. it's really hard to get a good blonde colouring it yourself.<br>  As you are naturally blonde you could try one of those home kits that remove the dye to take you back to your natural colour, i don't know too much about them but my friend used one and said it was the same as dye to put on and worked really well.<br>  Alternatively salons are always looking for models to practise on and they charge barely anything, obviously there's more risk of them doing it badly them normal, but its still a better bet then doing it yourself!<br>  If you're really insistent on doing it yourself then i like the herbal essences dyes and i would definitely suggest trying to dye it in stages, getting blonder as you go.|`|0nWgUE25aa	I know its expensive but when sying your hair lighter its probably the best idea to go to a salon.<br>  If you still dont want to do this i would still advise going to your hairdresser/Salon and ask for there advice on your hair type :) x|`|LkyArWdpaa	I have tried many times with different brands- it was fine for a while then turned ginger each time!!!!!!!!!

The best thing is to get into a routine! When you have extremely dark circles one product alone will not work. Applying foundation first then concealer and powder etc! Also try using a light reflective concealer than is one or two shades lighter than you natural skin tone. White eyeliner in the waterline of the eye can really brighten the eye - making you look less tired! You can also get illuminating creams and powders which brighten the skin.

And to make it worse I have sensitive skin. For makeup you should only use non comedgenic and oil free makeup (it will say on the label). If you want makeup that will clear your skin up you can get makeup that has sacilyic acid or other "skin clearing" products. Neutrogena has a good one. Make sure you always wash your face and moisturize (oil free). Powder and mineral forms of makeup are best for oily skin. Mabelline, BareMinerals, Physicians Formula, etc... have mineral foundations for any budget. <br>  <br>  Too help with oiliness you should buy oil blotting sheets. Boscia (buy at Sephora) and Clean & Clear (Target, Walmart, etc...) have good ones. They are sheets that absorb oil. You should use them around lunch time or whenever you need them. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Sal|`|wPtX51cjaa	i have really oily skin, but my makeup doesnt seem to affect it.  i use the mineral powder like maybelline.  and thats all, no foundation or anything.  sometimes i use concealer for a pimple.   but try to get oil free makeup and the mineral is also good for your skin.  but ive also been going to a dermatologist so my skin stays pretty clear.
r4i7xPnMaa	There are a couple ways...<br>  You can use a Foundation Brush, like a MAC 109, or any foundation brush from a drugstore. This EcoTools one at Walgreens is pretty great for the money. It's $6.<br>  <a href="http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.jsp?id=prod3853483&CATID=100290&skuid=sku3852332&V=G&ec=frgl_544613&ci_src=14110944&ci_sku=sku3852332" rel="nofollow">http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j...</a><br>   Just make sure you clean the brush every night with a brush cleaner or baby shampoo when you go to wash off your makeup, otherwise the leftover foundation in the brush becomes a breeding ground for bacteria, and you really don't want to smear that all over your face the next morning.<br>  <br>  You can also use a sponge. Blop some liquid foundation onto the back of your clean hand (you don't want to put the sponge on top of the bottle, otherwise the bacteria from your face touches the foundation in the bottle and contaminates the whole thing.)  and dot it onto your face. Blend it in, and make sure you don't have any mask-y lines. You'll want to toss your sponge and get a new one every week or so. Or if you buy a beautyblender/Sonia Kashuk sponge, clean it out very very frequently.<br>  <br>  If worse comes to  worse, you can use your hands, but I don't recommend it. It's really hard to get good, even coverage with your hands.<br>  <br>  I think the most economical, sanitary way to apply foundation is definitely with a brush. There are tons of tutorials on how to apply liquid foundation with a brush on Youtube. When I used liquid foundation, my brush was my best friend. Once I switched to powder foundation, I started using a MAC 187 brush and/or a kabuki brush for more coverage.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|IuVaXq1Daa	Preferabally with a foundation brush because thats most gentle on your skin and gets it on most even, but you can do it with a sponge or just your fingers if you're gentle enough (pat it on using your ring finger because your ring finger has the lightest touch and don't just drag it across your skin because this will damage it and you might get wrinkles when your older). :]|`|hzesz4P4aa	wash face.<br>  dry.<br>  put on some face lotion on.<br>  put liquid den powder [[foundation]]|`|TAgAnfIbaa	clean hands or a foundation brush|`|JqDkLWeTaa	depends what kind<br>  mineral powder- in circular motions with a kubiki brush<br>  lquid working inwards to out with a sponge or foundation brush<br>  loo|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I use a buffer brush like this one. it is from target and i LOVE this !!!!<br>  It washes well and I have no intrest in trying another one.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/Sonia-Kashuk-Synthetic-Blusher-Brush/dp/B00149VKTG/qid=1236648040/ref=br_1_3/191-1773417-5593453?ie=UTF8&node=726920011&frombrowse=1&rh=&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Sonia-Kashuk-Synth...</a>

qOVMZWMpaa	That's my trick. I usually do it out of boredom. My mum (hairdresser) taught me the other day that it actually makes the split end worse by tearing it off as it gives the hair a jagged edge and is easier to split again. It's easier to cut the split part off. Takes more effort I know :(|`|7riQpOy7aa	no don't do that it will damage your hair. have your hair cut more regulary or use reviving shampoo and conditioner. if you straighten your hair use heat protector spray to save your hair from drying out and getting split ends.|`|NvCcdszsaa	soak ur hair in a mountain of conditioner put a bag in ur head and go to sleep, get aa trim or buy a hairdye pack and use the conditioner in there. trust me, best stuff in the world.|`|na8ObA5Haa	brush your hair really hard and start from the top to the bottom. <br>  i have never heard of anyone that wanted split ends.. but that works.|`|IuVaXq1Daa	Sorry is this isn't what you want to hear, but the only cure for split ends is to chop them off. Also, no, ripping them won't work and will only make things worse. But you can buy hot oil treatments (VO5 do good, cheap ones) which will temporarily seal the nds untill you're ready to trim them. Take care :]|`|WJJ18mE8aa	There is nothing that you can do!

The thing i like about the aquage is it's make with seaextend.|`|IuVaXq1Daa	Yeah, using bad quality shampoo will completly strip your hair of it's natural oils and dry it out. And to make things worse you hair, upon realising it's drier than usual will produce more oil to compensate. In the end this will cause greasy roots and dry, brittle ends. Not good :[<br>  <br>  Salon shampoos are generally milder and much more gentle on the hair, but I'm sorry I couldn't recommend any because I've stopped using chemicals on my hair, I wash mine with honey and vinegar.

AA10369831	Keep color strong. Pastels like baby blue, baby pink, no matter how hard you try, read young—like, really young. Like, "Let’s-go-to-the-mall!" young. Strong, pure brights that have an almost hothouse-flower intensity to them—azalea pink, grass green, daffodil yellow—transmit confident, grown-up allure. Rule 2: Stick with simple lines and soft fabrics.

XaYHMNusaa	I'm pretty sure she left home in her early teens and began tattooing rather early on.  I don't think she went to college, but yeah,.|`|gW8VFRmjaa	no im fairly sure she didnt. i think she dropped out of high school and began tattooing around 18.|`|riBel7G2aa	no... she didnt even finish high school. she ran away with her boyfriend at a young age and when she eventually decided to leave him she moved to LA  and started working at shops|`|9QVjNaIPaa	im not sure she did but what does it matter anyways? she is still very beautiful, intelligent, successful, and classy. college isnt for everyone. she was able to live her life the way she wants without needing to go to college.|`|nHDMhJ92aa	I don't think she did either. I thought she started tattooing at 16. But it doesn't really matter. She's awesome! Extremely talented and very very successful.

So, honestly, I don't think it matters.
IAStQqOHaa	Hollywood has portrayed the fact that to be beautiful, you must:<br>  - Be tan<br>  - Be thin<br>  - WHITE teeth<br>  - Have designer clothes/bags/shoes<br>  - etc.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I am guilty of tanning /:<br>  I am REALLY pale and it makes me self-consious|`|WrmeB8zEaa	I think tans are ugly personally. But i don't reccomend you go at all. In about 20 years or so they'll be all wrinkly and have spots everywhere and your skin will be perfectly healthy!|`|JGjpc7Itaa	Excessive fake tanning and from the sun as well causes skin cancer.  It's a fact.  That is NO price to pay to look like everyone else!|`|XSwl1kjUaa	I completly agree with Leah Cullen and the one before that. Tans aren't the best.

Use it twice a day. It consists of liquid facial soap, clarifying lotion and moisturizer. I use the extra strengh liquid soap, number 2 clarifying lotion (the number you use depends on your daughters skin type, but combinations skin is suggested to use number 2.) and dramatically different moisturizing gel. Make sure she gets the gel moisturizer instead of the lotion because the lotion contains oils that she doesn't need more of. Hope I could help!<br>  Here is a guide to help you!

r4i7xPnMaa	Usually the MAC artists are very very helpful. You just have to be really specific in what you want, otherwise you kind of leave it open to their interpretation, which may or may not be the same as yours.<br>  <br>  Usually contouring colors are darkish brown hues, even for pale chicks. You even said that the blush you got will be used as a highlighter, which is the opposite of contouring, so I'm not really surprised that there was a mix-up there.<br>  <br>  I've had some fantastic MAC artists in my time using MAC, but I've also had a dud or two. I told one girl that I wanted a dark smokey look, and I left with orange. ORANGE. I thought it would grow on me, but nope. Thank god I didn't buy the shadows she used. Anyway, where I'm going with this is that not everyone has the same taste, so I guess when you ask for someone's opinion or someone's help, you're kind of inviting their opinion into the mix.

A dark brown shade is great for a dramatic look, and photography, if blended well.<br>  <br>  Part of it is that the brush and technique you use can affect how it comes out. Although they are artists, and sometimes sensitive, they do want you to be happy with what you come out of the store with. <br>  <br>  I must say, though, that most contouring blushes run very brown (and I'm a shade NC50 and even balk at the shades they suggest).|`|O1Xm6X7Iaa	I've sometimes had some odd outcomes when I've asked for help at a MAC counter but mostly they've been really helpful. As long as you clearly state what you want the finished effect to look like and what you don't want to look like then you should have no problems. They are artists so it's expected that they will be a bit more adventurous than us normal people when it comes to creating looks!<br>  <br>  I usually just go for it and buy something I like, then ask if they can give me some tips on a good way to wear it, especially if it's something I don't usually wear.|`|usShaZiQaa	They have tons of experience and practice on loads of people. Thing is, sometimes, if they're having a bad day or just don't know what o do with you because you're abnormally gorgeous.... they will most likely frick you up.... sorry. Go to another one and ask for their help. They might do a better job. Try to look for someone with your complexion.
9ufmeaUyaa	That one might because it has no business but otherwise a store going that great with there sales would NEVER close down cause all they want to do is make money so the answer to your question is that one but theirs only a one in a million chance of it closing down for good!|`|ODU3TO4Eaa	I think some of them might me.

But I think people could live without it. Most of their stuff is pretty tacky anyways. The only dif. between most of they're sweaters are like the necklines, the colors, and the stupid names they give them to sound like they're actually a designer. The weave is the same (cable knit...which is nice every now and then, but after a while is pretty boring) and most of the fabrics are the same. But what really bugs me is that they try to come off as a high quality store, and they don't even supply cashmere!!!!! So ya, I could def. live without Abercrombie, but if J.Crew went out of business, or....even WORSE, Ralph Lauren, THAT'S when I'd pass out and die!!!!|`|6476e9285a90f52b3c456feb90c7a260aa	maybe in some locations but not everywhere.|`|hUbNKOTsaa	some might be but not all of them|`|AA10907244	Yikes!<br>  <br>  That's what happens when they charge 75 bucks for a fricken shirt.|`|F60inLeOaa	After a turbulent Chirstmas 2008 fashion season with economic turn-down in the retail industry, Abercrombie & Fitch has adjusted its plans for 2009 to fit the persisting "environment".[34] The company's main commitments for the year is the openings of the HCO flagship (in SoHo), the abercrombie flagship (in Milan), and the two A&F flagships (in Milan and Tokyo).[34] There will be no EPS guidance for fiscal 2009.[34] The company estimates its total expidentures for fiscal 2009 to be $165 to $175 million USD ($125 million for new stores/remodeling and $45-50 million for various Home Office projects).[34] Plans on expansion in Europe have been slightly altered.[34]|`|AA11172517	maybe the one where you live but the company wouldnt close all its stores.|`|axbxlaxFaa	lol thats wat happens when they charge 90 buks for one pair of jeans lol|`|60771dkEaa	maybe some stores but not the whole chain

Just take a very small curling iron, about 3/4" and wrap small sections of your hair around the barrel of the iron and hold it for about 10 seconds and release it. Be careful not to burn your fingers. If your hair is past your shoulders then corkscrew curls will look good on you.

r4xRkqzdaa	laurn is WRONG... sunscreen doesn't add up!!!!  your only as protected as your highest spf level!<br>  <br>  most times, you don't wear the make up thick enough to really provide the full SPF 20.<br>  <br>  i would not use the same sunscreen your going to be using on your shoulders!  buy a facial moisturizer that has sunscreen in it and use that instead of your normal moisturizer.  if you burn easily, you may have to re-apply during the day, especially at the beginning of the cruise until you get a little tan|`|r4i7xPnMaa	Oh yikes, no way. Neutrogena makes oil-free non-comedogenic sunscreens for your face. I use their Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with SPF 45 before I go out into the sun. I have pretty oily skin to begin with, so I end up having to blot mid-day anyway. But I suppose I'd rather blot than get sunburned. <br>  <br>  There are tons of sunscreens meant to be used on your face. Just make sure you get one that can protect from UVA and UVB rays. And don't be afraid to reapply if you think you've been out and about for a long time.|`|SppeWngYaa	Sun damage makes you look old beyond your years. The spf in a mineral make-up is a physical barrier and will wear off and you will probably sweat it off as well. Your make-up was designed as a make-up first not a sunscreen. In my opinion, it is not enough. If you don't like the way sunscreen feels on your face, wear a hat :) Have fun!|`|0Kr1VBk0aa	use olay complete<br>  its an all day moisture lotion with SPF 15. it's light and non-greasy.<br>  <br>  they have it for different skin types like normal and sensitive.<br>  <br>  here's a pic of it:<br>  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0JK2pw5Tavo/RpO7hS2sA9I/AAAAAAAAAWU/qkOO7VM3Abs/s400/co1005de.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0JK2pw5Tavo/Rp...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps =]|`|JqDkLWeTaa	no but if i were you i would use a moisterizer b4 it really helps mineral make up stick and u can get one with spf 15 or 20 and youll have like a tottal of 35-40 spf!|`|DpQQZg3Daa	If you are getting in the pool, use sunscreen with zinc in it for your face...CVS has some that isnt too oily.<br>  Also, everyday i use Olay lotion (white bottle with a black cap) that has sunscreen in it.

I'm a freakishly pale redhead who would much rather wear leggings and tights year-round than blind passersby with my whiteness, but my mum talked me into trying this stuff out. I use the kind for Medium Skin Tones because the change is more noticeable (the Light Skin Tones branch does nothing whatsoever) without being obvious. No streaks, no nastiness, no orange hue...and even better, the scent is wonderful! It keeps my legs soft and glowing, no matter what. I put it on every three or four days in the spring and summer, and now I can't stop looking at my beautiful legs!<br>  <br>  I found a buy-one-get-one-free deal at CostCo / BJ's / Sam's Club, but I'm positive it's also at Target, etc. for a great price.<br>  <br>  Check it out here: <a href="http://jergens.com/Our_Collection/Product_Detail.asp?ProductID=34" rel="nofollow">http://jergens.com/Our_Collection/Produc...</a><br>  <br>  What I do is shave, dry my legs, then apply the lotion. I wait a couple minutes and then take a damp washcloth and wipe the tops of my feet, my ankles, the backs of my feet, and my knees (since those areas typically tan at a different rate). And then...voilá! You're lovely. (: (:|`|LlUl85sMaa	Johnsons Holiday Skin, works wonders for me, people actually started asking me where i had been on holiday =D

But if you must try it.. (this is a simple way to layer long top with less mistakes...) take your hair and pull half it it up from the occipital bone up (it is the lump in the back of your head) comb out a half pony tail by using a comp to part it (like a halo look) comb the hair all the way up with both hands.. then use your finger to measure one or two inches on the ends.. cut off only 2 inches max of the hair.. again i do not recommend doing this yourself, but this is how to do long layers (also expect it to be uneven since its hard to have maximum tension when you do this yourself)|`|EvKw0l6Eaa	dont

People add new ones all day long every single day, so you have to check often and respond to see it to buy right away.People do not always remove their ad when they sell items so if they do not contact you back, most likely its sold. <br>  <br>  Use google maps, put in your address, in the search nearby put in thrift stores, or consignment stores, hit enter and a list will be on the left, you can then just call to see if they have any in stock so you dont have to drive all around looking to see if they have them.

C23OXIbpaa	i do the same thing. try using shampoo, conditioner, & hair serum that contains some sort of moisturizer or hydrating fluid. also, try skiping weekends or using a lower heat setting.|`|FzmVMBmMaa	You ARE damaging your hair. You are adding too much heat to it. It's frying it. You can deep condition your hair if it is damaged, and leave it in for maybe the weekend. After that, begin using a heat-protection serum.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	yup over time it can be damaged to heal maybe just give ur hair a rest for like a month or get it deep conditioned at your nearest salon also u should use heat protection spray so it wont become damaged again|`|ZhTWBx7saa	Yeah, it is getting damaged I am in the same situation, but there is this little white bottle of pantene repair damage thing that you can get at walmart for $4 and it is like a deep conditioning treatment for people who use heat products just leave it in for about 20 minutes or less only once a week and it should help.<br>  Also if you would want I suggest getting shampoo for people who use heat styling and also something that you rub in your hair like, got2b hottie, before you straighten it before it gets worse, like mine.|`|vycAqfkiaa	Yes heat everyday will definitely damage your hair if you don't use either a leave in conditioner or a heat protectant. You can keep it healty by keeping up with trims every 6 weeks, using deep conditioners (where you sit under a hooded dryer) that promises protein (to mend split ends)  and moisture (to keep it luster and add the moisture back). Also use a moisturizing shampoo. Heat strips moisture from your hair so use shampoos and conditioners that will not take more but will add it back. A lot of shampoos actually contain soap and strip moisture from the hair. Try blow drying your hair straight instead of flat ironing to avoid the amount of heat to the hair shaft. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Z08iVuGJaa	Everytime you straighten your hair you dry it out and damage it. You can prevent this buy using special heat resistent items. However, once the damage is done there is no way to repair the hair. All you can do is go to a hairdresser and ask them to take of the damaged part, the amount they have to take off will depend on how much you have straightened it.|`|5oQbDhl2aa	yea, u need heat protecting spray. it doesn't cost that much and it lasts a long time. i use this really good kind..i forgot what it's called but it's in a black bottle w/ a red top.|`|EvKw0l6Eaa	it is damaged. use hair serum...it moturizes ur hair

JMJsCU1vaa	buy a tube of Equate Daily Face Wash at Walmart, it's about 2.75 a tube and should last you at least a month or more, also get a facial cleansing pad in the same section (cosmetics) it fits over your four fingers and is real soft...<br>  Clean your face with this lotion and water only, don't add colognes or anything like after shave and also be careful about hair gel, this can flow down your forehead when you sweat throughout your day and cause problems, also don't be afraid to occasionally take a hot wash rag and wipe your face from time to time... This alone should give you tremendous results, and the cost is so cheap.<br>  It worked for my kids and a lot of their friends, and for the girls, don't use make-up, that is most of your problem right there.|`|ttGGDTnlaa	i dont really get acne or pimples or whatever<br>  but when i do i just use the neutrogena face washes and on the spot acne cream and my pimples go away within 3-4 days!<br>  also remember to NEVER pop pimples that only creates an infection under the skin causing you to break you out even more<br>  <br>  truth is proactiv doesnt work on everyone some of the ingrediants they use are harsh on sensitive skin so neutrogena is the safe way to go plus its cheaper,dermotologist recommended, and you can find it at walmart,cvs,walgreens<br>  :]<br>  www.neutrogena.com

H6uYThgjaa	You should add some color, like a blue shade around it (or different color). don't get it on the back of your neck. pick a place that is less visible for i.e. your job situation. i think it would look nice on the your side right above the hip. that's unique and not everyone can see it.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I personally think it would look better on the neck, but that's just me. Consider things like work though - if you have a job in the future than does not allow visible ink, it only takes one gust of wind to blow your hair out the way, so you could find yourself having to wear high necked tops all of your working life. Similarly the ankle, you'd be restricted to wearing dark tights or socks to cover it in this scenario. Perhaps, instead of the neck, slightly below the neck, central at the very top of your back might look nice.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Believe it or not i have seen this tattoo on a few people and my favorite spot was the lower back but off to the side not in the middle. It looked really good there but if you don't like the spot then out of the two you said i would go with the neck because im not too fond on tattoo's on the legs when its on a girl. Good Luck!|`|AA12032352	There are arguments for and against both locations. I have tattoos in both spots. I am a professional woman who has to keep my ink covered at work. <br>  <br>  The back of the neck is bad, because if you go into a professional field you can't wear your hair up at work.<br>  <br>  The ankle is bad, because if you go into a professional field you can't wear skirts to work.<br>  <br>  I love both of my tattoos, and am ok with the accommodations I have to make for work. <br>  <br>  The back of the neck though is the more tricky idea. I can't imagine ever wearing my hair short, but if you end up in a conservative office that option for hairstyle is gone.<br>  <br>  As far as pain wise.....the back of my neck was the least painful spot I've gotten a tattoo.....ankle, chest, shoulder, booty, hip, neck.......and the ankle.....well lets just say it doesn't tickle when they go over the ankle bone or the Achilles tendon!|`|cKuHXJQyaa	i've seen this tattoo on about 10 maybe more people.<br>  where i've seen it was wrist and back.<br>  <br>  i'd go with back of your neck, or maybe lower.|`|3llK5y7Baa	that tattoo is kinda boring...i do not like it|`|qo8SalPIaa	That's a really neat design!!  Depending on your age and future career, depends on where you should get it. Just think if you will be in a formal office and they dont allow tattoos, you couldnt wear your hair up if its on your neck, and you couldnt wear a skirt if its on your ankle.. What about the inside of your wrist. A simple watch or bangle bracelet would cover it.. Other than that depending on when you want to show it, I think the design your wanting would look nice running down your side with the symbol on each side of the saying ( in some kind of font like script or a really nice cursive- Kinda like they always have on the covers of romance novels ) .. ..Try this font..|`|3lCeMP2Gaa	Back on the neck or back of the shoulder, if you have it on your ankle the font may be unreadable because it's a smaller area and may look like a blob when you're older.<br>  <br>  La tua Cantante in English means "Your singer"...is that what you want it to say?<br>  <br>  Make sure you know what it says before you get it done!

Qe9rXFm0aa	The number one thing you need to do is go to a salon, and have your eyebrows done!! Once you get those shaped up..you will notice a HUGE change in your overall look.<br>  Next to that..I would go medium brown with some carmel highlights in your hair..cut your hair a little shorter with long layers, and do a side swept bang.<br>  <br>  As for makeup..keep it simple..easy on the foundation, add in some bronzer, just do mascara..and on occasion try a brown eye liner..O and defintely add some clear gloss|`|RbyK5biSaa	i think you need a light pink blush, when you smile in the mirror put it on the top of the cheek bones!!!<br>  good luck u r pretty.|`|EOptJgsEaa	I think you should use eyeliner.<br>  Where glossy lip gloss and no one will focus on anything your self conscious about .<br>  P.s I use the same soap that's in the back lol :)|`|4l2qOy7Paa	you look sooooooooooo pretty as it is. =]|`|c23Unb5daa	you have very pretty skin & eyes.<br>  <br>  a lot of peoples lips are the same color as their skin. add some pink lip gloss or shiny.<br>  <br>  get some colored eyeliner! or black will do.<br>  <br>  i love bronzer! instead of having pink blush or what not i use bronzer. it adds a more natural tan look to the skin.<br>  im browned skin so it doesnt matter but your skin is light so it will look like you just got a tan!|`|c3j49t9Faa	The only problem I have with your look is your eyebrows. They look too tweezed and kinda strange.  Let them grow in and go have them professionally done.  I think you should just wear mascara and some gloss until you get more confident putting on makeup.  Seriously fix the eyebrows though it will help you look better|`|kEZFplC9aa	your eyes are amazing. if i were<br>  you, i wouldn't wear much, if any,<br>  more than you already do! maybe<br>  try a lengthening mascara to draw<br>  attention to your eyes. i suggest<br>  covergirl lash blast. (: wear a<br>  shimmery neutral eye shadow if<br>  you feel the need. your skin looks<br>  nice as well. just finish off with a<br>  mineral powder, like neutrogena<br>  sheer minerals. and well i think<br>  that your forehead is fine, but if<br>  it's that much of a concern to you,<br>  then you should try bangs. something<br>  simple would work best. i think<br>  these would work well with your<br>  type of hair:<br>  <a href="http://cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload//4000/400/30/3/24433.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cdn-write.demandstudios.com/uploa...</a>|`|dWdoy5e4aa	you look really pretty. dont cake your makeup on like some girls out there. wear foundation,bronzer,mascara(sometimes eyeliner to bring out your gorgeous eyes),and lipgloss :] <br>  <br>  mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309141448AAl9q2i">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|TEPG4q7xaa	get bangs!! <br>  you would be so fricken adorable. <br>  i know this dosent answer your q <br>  but do it!! it will minimize your forehead. :D|`|eJ3K8ljyaa	macara and concealer:D|`|GBOgsAoDaa	bronzer.. liquid eyeliner on the top lid and lipglosss|`|QLjjfwRfaa	I actually think your pretty in some ways. Your forehead's honestly not that big and your nose can be worked with. Your fortunate looking. <br>  <br>  What I love doing is giving myself cat eyes. You can do this by taking eyeliner (I personally use a dark brown because brown goes with blue) and drawing a thick line close to your lashes on the upper lid. You then draw a small line peeking out form the corner of your eye. Smudge that line with your finger or a q-tip and makie sure the line on the corner of your eye slants upward a tiny bit on the edge.<br>  <br>  I would then take a light shadow (a gold or bronze) and dust that over your eye lid. Something soft. Even a creamy color would look great; nuetral colors (soft browns, tan, ect.). Make sure you put it on lightly and blend it (you dont want to look like trash or a make up monster)<br>  <br>  Then cover the lips in a very light pink, sparkly Victoria Secret Gloss. They have the very best stuff. Even a sparkly clear would look great. Nothing too dark.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! You truly are very pretty.|`|kQFbOk6aaa	you should get short side bangs to help with the slight forehead problem(no offense) and your nose isnt all that big just ignore it you a medium brown would look excelent on you for your hair and your eye shadow should be an almost white blended with grey all over and a blended gray and black in the crease of the eye would look great with some red red red lip stick you would look like a model|`|N7bWdl3Xaa	honestly, you have a really pretty natural face, or whatever you did in the 3rd picture is ur best look. your forhead is fine and if u get bangs it will take away from your face. and dont worry about your nose because ur gunna have to live with it so might as well accept it. but honestly ur a natural beauty. be lucky ur nose isnt that bad.. believe me ive seen some horror stars walkin the streets- noses stretchin farther and wider than you could picture. so just be happy you have great looks!|`|cpfcRw0Oaa	overall, u dont look bad now, but this is what i suggest.<br>  the eyebrows were the first thing that i noticed, somethings not right there... let them grow out and have them done professionally. <br>  practice makes perfect with makeup. just play in front of a mirror until u find a look that works for you.<br>  i recommend shorter side swept bangs. the hair color is good.<br>  :)|`|evEJxv06aa	i think you look very pretty but here's a site to find the prefect makeup  that you can put on it's called nextag.com|`|lc2WYfeTaa	Along with the foundation and mascara..i would try a purple or green eyeshadow it would bring out you eyes!!!

xU3uBy4Saa	Question1:  It all depends on you.  If you think that three piercings on one ear is too much, then get your left ear pierced.  Also, another thing to consider is which ear you use the most.  Like when you talk on the phone, and then side you fall asleep on.  Because during the healing process, it gets really sore.  But my friend who has 4 piercings on one of her ears, has a tragus also on that ear.  I personally think that tragus piercing look better on both ears.  That is just because I think having just one ear looks awkward.<br>  <br>  Question 2:  Pain.  That all just depends on how you can tolerate pain.  I have a pretty high pain tolerance, so when I got it pierced it did hurt.  But it was not at all like an excruciating type of pain.  If it definitely bearable.  When my piercer pierced me, he did all the sterilization on stuff.  And drew a dot on my ear to see if I liked the position.  Then, he clamped my tragus and then not even 5 seconds later, the needle is in.  As the needle goes through, you hear this really loud crunching sound, so don't get scared!  Then they just put the jewelry in.|`|MU7vSOgeaa	I think it would look good on the ear that you already have your cartilage pierced... but to balance it out maybe the left ear would be better.<br>  <br>  i've had my traguses pierced many times... and because it's really hard cartilage it has a little sting for like a second but that's it. you also have to be careful when sleeping because sleeping on the earring will irritate it.<br>  <br>  they pierce it just like any other piercing done with a needle... they put the little tongs on it after they mark it and put the need through.|`|24sK6L2uaa	I think left so the other ear doesn't look as crowded. I don't know about pain but I asked my friend who has cartilage and tragus she said they felt about the same. Don't get it done with a gun but not every place will use the tong things either that depends on the piercer. Good Luck and let me know.|`|XaYHMNusaa	Either ear would look fine w/ a tragus piercing, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  And I've never gotten either of mine pierced, so I don't know about the pain.  They pierce it w/ a needle [if you go to a place and they pierce w/ guns, RUN!].|`|F1QjqqxRaa	I agree left ear ;) and the pain isin't much (i don't know cause i dont have one )|`|EKPf0UHeaa	Well for the first question I think it would look better on your left ear
8484b98b7322a891688e78db30e42f20aa	DEFINITELY, definitely Artistry control eyeliner, mate! Works so bloody well and smoothly. It also pops out my eyes and since I have everyday normal brown eyes, that's saying something. And it hardly smudges, which is great for me since I rub my eyes all the time. Anyway, I get it from the website (pasted below) since it's cheaper than from the store, I believe.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I also used to wear Urban Decay 24/7 so that's another choice, but then I switched since it really, really didn't work for me as it wouldn't last through the day and would even smudge sometimes.

7f6d435d56ad7cbfe4aed43f9d4134a5aa	I have been selling Avon for 11 years so I can pretty much answer any questions you may have. For new representatives, you earn 50% commssion for the first 4 campaigns-- that is 2 months. <br>  <br>  It does sell, but you have to get your name and books out there. It does cost 7.50 a campaign for a website, but if you have 1 customer a campaign, that fee is waived. There is a sign up fee for your kit, which includes books for the first month, supplies, etc. If you sign up with local representative it is $10.00, if you sign up online it is $20.00. <br>  Some people make great money, others do not. I would try it, if you don't like it, you can always stop selling BEWARE, some recruiters can be pushy, so if you decide to quit selling, I would contact Avon directly if you don't feel comfortable talking to that person.|`|KqxQlPrNaa	I wouldn't

That's something to consider, too, is that it's just awful when they get infected, and sometimes it's unavoidable.  Don't let that scare you though!  If you're that terrified though, I'd wait until you feel more comfortable with it.  Maybe a few years.<br>  <br>  You can also get clip on/ screw on earrings.

vycAqfkiaa	well unfortunately you wont be able to achieve natural waves if your hair isn't naturally wavy. But you can fake a natural wave look! You will need a curling iron that gets really hot with a 1 inch barrel. Then take 1/2-1 inch sections of hair and twirl it around the barrel while holding it open. Once all the hair is twirled around the iron, close it and hold for about 30 seconds. Gently but pull the iron to give way to the curl, and wait like 3 seconds then spray it with and extra holding spritz. Use products for your hair type that promise extra hold and volume. Once finished finger comb through your hair starting from ends to root carefully not to tangle or mess up the curls. Shake your hair upside down for a natural look. <br>  Also type in something like "create natural waves with curling iron" into youtube.com and you can see clear videos on how to do this. <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|d8FjURwhaa	Try Mixed chicks, You should go on mixdchicks.net a lot of people reccomned it and i heard its rlly good!

jWmnSXlLaa	I get this too the exact same issue. I have sensitive eyes and tend to stay away from certain types of eye makeup. I use been using makeup removing pads latley This has seemed to have helped a little.|`|I1tnVvVGaa	sounds like you're getting soap in your eyes....have you tried regular makeup remover? try the ponds makeup remover wipes....they're pretty gentle on your eyes. and don't wipe with toilet paper....that could be irritating your eyes also.|`|23xC6I2Gaa	It sounds like you are having an allergy to the Dove Soap. I would try finding something else to wash with - maybe find something that is for eye-makeup remover specifically.<br>  <br>  Also, try patting your eyes dry rather than rubbing/wiping them dry.|`|NWSsIFrDaa	You should use a mild cold cream instead of soap the eyelids are very sensitive.

Z96XbROJaa	Different salons give their employees different titles, I would put Tanning Consultant and/or Sales Consultant, depending on how much sales were emphasized at your salon. There are different certifications, most common is probably Smart Tan [<a href="https://www.smarttan.com/]." rel="nofollow">https://www.smarttan.com/].</a> The industry would be "tanning," however, it can also fall under sales and/or retail.

bCP4CPiaaa	yeah me too|`|J7RuBjPTaa	I get that too.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE! lol|`|FTE5OReOaa	Yes I get this with heeled boots, but not with flats. My life saver is to carry around a pair of compact flat ballet pumps in my bag to swap around during the day.

Y3htXG88aa	The best way to achieve this look is by going to salon. Ask for lots of layers like you described and for your hair to be texturized.

paOPuM4Paa	Well sometime you need to push a little harder on your eye but also if your finger is to wet it gets stuck so dry your finger off then put the contact back on your finger then try again....It gets easier believe me! <br>  Hope this helped!|`|ODU3TO4Eaa	It's so hard to put contacts in at first! The first thing you need to do is wash and dry your hands really well. Then, put a few drops of contact solution onto the contacts. Use your fingers to open your eyes reeeaalll wide (I'm right-handed so I put my contact on my right index finger and use my right middle finger to pull down the bottom part of my eye and my left middle finger to hold up the top part of my eyelid--you'll have to experiment and see what works for you). Look up and touch the contact to your eye. Blink and you SHOULD be good.<br>  <br>  It's really hard to do the first time but once you get used to it, its pretty easy. Here's one tip: make sure your contact isn't flipped the wrong way. I do that all the time. If you're having a lot of problems, call your eye doctor and ask them if you can come in so they can show you how to put your contacts in. =)|`|SIE3HuHRaa	Omg! lol I'm thirteen and I just got contacts! Anyways I'm ur savior! lol usually your eye doctor should be able to contact you and have a contact fitting where they teach you how to use them and properly care for them. look at this website! Make sure to wash your hands before you touch your contacts and if the contact falls somewhere, flush it with your disinfectant/ contact liquid.

Yet I have a pair I got from Walmart for $1 that are amazingly comfortable. <br>  I am beginning to think that the cheaper the flip-flop is, the more comfortable. :]<br>  <br>  Why are they so popular? Well I think back in the day is was just so versatile compared to other shoes they wore. Maybe it was the first sandal invented?

AgrfCajvaa	your tattoo will end up looking spotty and you will need to get a touch up. When you pick at the scab you will remove ink that hasn't set in completely... it's bad news!|`|rFMRgHTdaa	they say if you do that then the color comes off and it might leave scaring. Just out lotion that helped me.|`|H3PcFertaa	Your tattoo will be ruined. It will have patches and scarring. It will need to be done over or touched up.|`|ZkrGttKaaa	Well, what a lot of folks think is that the ink is in the skin. It's put there, true enough, but it doesn't stay there. It comes out and forms in the scab. The scab uses the healing time to dye the skin the colors of the pigment in it. If you take your fingernail and scratch off a scab that's been there less than a week or nine days, guess what? There is no tattoo under it. The ink, or color pigments, haven't had time to dye the skin, before they come out with the scab. Which is what a tattoo really is... dyed skin. People mistakenly think their tattoo has 'faded'. They're just looking at the skin that's been dyed, and not at the ink anymore. The tattoo isn't faded. The ink has just finally fallen off with the scab. Good question! Take care.|`|nHDMhJ92aa	If you know you shouldn't then don't! lol...If you pick a scap, the ink could come out, it could get infected, and cause scarring. Make sure to keep your tat moisturized with some ointment, most places I've been have recommended a&d ointment, usually found in the baby care section(by the diaper rash cremes) or in the first aid department. I've always heard itching means it's healing...When mine would itch, I'd take a little ointment and rub it in on the spots that itched. That usually helped.|`|8oWXYJj3aa	When I got mine, they told me that if you picked it off you could get it infected and have problems because you are opening your skin up to germs.  I noticed mine rubbed off/came off when I showered eventually and some of it wasn't totally healed and it seemed like it was lighter than it was suppose to be... I don't know if that happens because it wasn't totally healed and some of the ink came out? I don't know if that is possible or not, but something to think about.

eWObKmBSaa	If you have super dry scalp, then use a cream, use some vitamin e and massage it in parts of the scalp.  Use small amounts too.  But there are also shampoos that hve vitamin e in them too.
wpTQSkwRaa	Eyelashes take a while to grow back. But yes, they do grow back. They are probably coming in thinner because of the false eyelash glue that isn’t too good for the eyelashes. When using eyelash glue, let it dry for a few seconds till it's tacky so it doesn't leak and get on your eyelashes. Fake eyelashes should be put above the eyelash line, not on it. If you are concerned about the fullness and length of your eyelashes I suggest you just condition them everyday with either a home remedy or a product specifically made for eyelash conditioning and growth.<br>  <br>  Some home remedies: Vaseline, Olive oil, and castor oil<br>  <br>  A few products designed for eyelashes: Ardell Brow & Lash Accelerator Treatment Gel, Claudia Stevens Eyelash Thickener<br>  <br>  I use Ardell at night before I go to bed and my lashes are nice and healthy even though I wear waterproof mascara everyday. Make sure you aren't allergic to any of the ingredients because that can cause more harm than help. Eating healthy and taking vitamins helps too.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps :-).|`|kEZFplC9aa	haha. of course.<br>  it just takes forever. d:|`|xN0bB8EGaa	Yes they grow back.|`|U0Eop7Rxaa	yes they will , slowly though.|`|64O0ydUfaa	Yeah they will grow back, but it will take a few weeks or months or something like that.  I would suggest not leaving in fake eyelashes for more than a day or two, as you can reuse them.<br>  <br>  <br>  xox Emily xox|`|r4hJTqMAaa	yes they will but it will take a long time. about two eyelashes grow back in one month.

nNSoOWQDaa	I don't use them, L'oreal tests on animals. There are many other companies that don't test that make products just as good and better, you just have to do your research.

Coach isn't exactly far behind, but at least they can stick to one pattern and not have the brand plastered all over the front. <br>  And sure, this is a rude answer. But i did answer the question.... <br>  Personally, i dislike both (and believe both companies have turned into brands meant only for those young wannabe fashionista's who don't understand true fashion) but i would definitely have to say that Coach bags aren't all completely hideous.<br>  <br>  If it makes a difference. i'm 16. <br>  and i have extremely strong opinions. :P<br>  <br>  and to the last answerer... that's exactly the right word for juicy. Tacky... i couldn't remember that word when i was writing this response xD|`|swZEnNv0aa	Ugh I think juicy is so tacky, it's gross.

CV4bDv65aa	The black, because that shape of purple/pink doesn't really mix as well as the black.  The brown distracts one from the skirt, and sorta confuses you.  Definitely black, but to 'spice' it up more, try wearing a simple, long necklace.  :)|`|FHQZz8dNaa	Since they are both neutrals both are fine. I personally like the black one better, because it goes more with the skirt.

They turn out quite well sometimes, if you're careful to follow the instructions.|`|t3VNcCCiaa	ok this is what you do: first you wrap the shirt in a oval then you tie up 2 2 rubber bands all over it. then you fill a sink with the dye and water. then you let it soak depending on how deep the color you want the longer you let it soak. like pink if you wanted a dark pink then you leave it in a long time if you want it light colored then not very light. also you could take it out 2 see what it looks like every once and a while.|`|JigcvrsMaa	they're easy. you need to buy a tye dye kit though. you tie up the shirt with rubber bands however you please, then take the tye dye stuff and squirt it on the shirt.  you let it set and dry for about a dye, undo the rubber bands, then there ya go, you have your own unique tye dye shirt|`|XOMX2pEqaa	where do u live?<br>  if u have a michaels there go buy a tiedying kit....it will tell u everything u have 2 do<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.michaels.com/art/online/displayProductPage?productNum=gc0496" rel="nofollow">http://www.michaels.com/art/online/displ...</a><br>  these r the best ones 2 get|`|8qAvEml4aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zFv7rs0jsQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zFv7rs0j...</a><br>  <br>  hope i helped!!<br>  -Cat|`|Rqt2DRzSaa	put random rubber bands around clumps of cloth, dip the excess fabric that is tied up into the dye.

f5RzWf1Gaa	Well if everything is not sold out, it depends what she likes. Everyone is raving for the pink fish lip conditioner-soooo if you can get her that-that's a bonus. :). I've heard that the nail polishes are super pretty. The lip glasses are gorgeous and the lip sticks are so cute! I also hear that the beauty powder blushes are really nice. If you edit to say what she likes-I'll edit too :D<br>  <br>  ADDED/EDIT: <br>  <br>  Well if she loves eyeliner you could try and get a hold of the hello kitty mild glitter eyeliner <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.ca/templates/collections/collection.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY28425" rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.ca/templates/col...</a> it's cool and collectible 15-18 im in a different counrty so the prices are different here you could get her that and one of the eyeshadow quads-which one depedns on her skin tone/personality. that would be about 68 right there b/c the eyeshadow is really expensive- 50 on its own. <br>  <br>  or if you want to get her a little more than just 2 things-but before i say that i dont think the hello kitty kouture gloss is worth it 30 bucks?!?! the hello kitty normal lip glasses are cuter anyways in my opinion<br>  <br>  so if you don't get he the quad you can get her a hk lip glass, <br>  a hk eye liner and a hello kitty beauty powder or beauty powder blush-they give a nice glow and have such cute packaging! if she doesn't like glittery eyeliner you can go with a quad and a gloss [CUTE COMBO i would personally LOVE it!] or you could get a hk lip glass, a beauty powder blush or powder and the nail liqueur also very cute combo :)  <br>  <br>  which colors depends on her skin tone and personality :) if she doesn't already have a brush kit for the makeup-some drugstores carry great ones for cheaper like eco tools or you can get her a hk lip glass and brush-but then she would have no use for the brush. anyways good luck and you're a great friend for getting her suck nice expensive gifts! :) happy birthday to your friend!<br>  <br>  also the mac mascara kinda suck or are nothing special the best is plush lash but there are still ones just as good as it-it'd be a waste to spend that much on mediocre to crappy mascara :/ :)|`|XduOH40baa	pink fish lip conditioner for sure!  also the pink nail polish!|`|Lr7LxmNXaa	I just saw some of the collection in nordstroms, and im sure the lip glosses, lipsticks, eyes shadows and most of the stuff is under 63 bucks, you could probably get her a few things...just go to nordstroms or  macys and check it out.|`|SjY27tgsaa	the palettes are 38 a piece i believe.<br>  4 colors in each, i like them.<br>  lucky tom and too dolly.

78z7gk7naa	If your hair is beginning to break, the last thing you want to do is dye it. I say use damaged hair shampoo/conditioner for awhile till your hair gets more healthier. Than dye again.<br>  <br>  But it matters, if you want to take the chance go for it and dye. Its your choice.<br>  <br>  And dont be self conscious, I think everyone has gotten a cut, dye, etc. on their hair they didnt like. Just dont look self conscious about it, people will probably not notice it unless you act nervous about it. Wear it confidently if your not dying it now, till you are going to dye it.|`|kEZFplC9aa	i think that you should get a medium<br>  brown with auburn reddish undertones.<br>  (the red will balance out your pale skin<br>  and cover up the dark underneath). and<br>  if possible you could find a boxed hair<br>  color that comes with highlights as well<br>  and then you can put a few lighter streaks<br>  in to give definition. i think this look would<br>  totally end your days of self-consciousness.

I dyed my hair dark brown last year and it came out black and myself.. i'm rather white. So i tried dying it a lighter brown to lighten it after my roots showed at inch. Which.. didn't work. So i just dyded it dark brown again. So my roots became a dark brown but not as dark as the rest of my hair. So I deiced to just let it grow. Cuz once your hair starts breaking it needs a rest. <br>  I don't think that really helps but your not alone :)|`|gBORIDfXaa	o no!!! lol bleach is horriblee!!!<br>  <br>  my advice would be to use Natural Insticts dark brown dye<br>  <br>  which i used a few months ago over my bleachd hair which was frizzy<br>  <br>  and the dye actually works and makes your hair silky .. and now.. a few months later. the dye actually fades and matches your natural light color!!<br>  <br>  and your hair is restored. :D|`|xvCl8HqDaa	i had the same problem years ago.  dying it again too soon will only cause more breakage.  the best thing to do right now is to use a lot of deep conditioner and split end treatments (i use got 2 b's hair strengthener).  once your hair starts showing improvement, go ahead and re-dye  your hair.|`|AA12140329	I think you should dye it if your really worried about it box dye isnt bad it made my hair silky try garnier frutis(sorry about the spelling) dye|`|gaoVzYQSaa	Ahh, my elder sister is in the exact same situation, she has naturally very dark brown hair and she decided she wanted it a bit lighter one day. She got her highlights in a professional salon, but her ''blonde'' highlights have made her hair really ruined now. It's so frizzy and elastically thin.<br>     Anyway, to answer your question, I think you should dye your hair dark again. It wont damage your hair anymore because dark hair dyes have much fewer harmful chemicals than blonde, so you can get rid of the nasty bleach, healthily. If you keep the highlights, you're not going to be happy (obviously) so I think you should go back to dark. Even if you buy a really dark dye, your hair might still be a but light, because of the bleached parts of hair underneath. Oh and the stylists ALWAYS ask you to come back for more ( done that to my sister too ) all they want is your money. I personally think salon's charge far too much for highlights anyway.<br>       So yeah it's what I would do. I had bleach blonde hair for 5 years and it was in bad condition (thin, hard to tease, needed 10 tonnes of conditioner) until I recently dyed it black, now it's in great condition. It's shiny, thick and just looks 10 x better. Darker is definitely better for your, or any ones' hair.|`|RtG5Iarbaa	I recommend a semi permanent colour. Get a lighter brown or maybe even a lighter red, and within a month your hair will be back to its natural colour. But if it all fades out and the dyed colour is still underneath, just dye it again then, but this stuff lasts about a month or more, depending how often you shower.|`|tuXBPrjsaa	you should not do neither!<br>  <br>  i just got off the phone with my hair stylist (shes also one of my bfs)<br>  she said to not dye it or anything for atleast 2 weeks your damaging your hair worse.<br>  <br>  she explained that if she has a client that explains to her that they are very unsatisfied with their hair she re does it for free.<br>  <br>  and she said if your hair stylist wont do that you should consider in 2 WEEKS to go to another stylist

I have trouble keeping a regular triangle shaped top on haha<br>  <br>  Just be careful(: and get a size smaller than you think you need for the top so it's more snug.|`|4GFwrpIwaa	wow a bit expensive for this economy|`|RK42Z5Iiaa	Yea but...........watch it...lol|`|ZQt6DqWgaa	so cute. and as long as you are aware and careful - it will|`|wTjNJEr1aa	yea, but if your really flat, liek nothing at all, then it may slide, but make sure you try it on before you buy it, adn be careful!|`|TeJEJDKLaa	my friend has that same bathing suit (in blue)...and its always falling.<br>  try these:<br>  <a href="http://www.forever21.com/swimwear/swim_main.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.forever21.com/swimwear/swim_m...</a><br>  i have some from there...they work pretty good.|`|cGwa5XHSaa	No because it has a strap if it didn't i would say it would fall down a lot|`|KDXisAOlaa	omg i have the same one!!<br>  it will stay up but at the beach it comes down once and a while. <br>  But it doesnt bother me.|`|i7rEzn8daa	those suits aren't really meant for swimming in...<br>  mostly for only tanning.
lc2WYfeTaa	I use to get acrylic nails until someone told me about the gel nails....I think gel nails are better they seem stronger as far as breaking and when you need a fill they tend not to show as much as acrylic's do!!! Not only that but I smudge nail polish soooo bad!! And with the gel..once your done your done you don't have to wait for them to dry..and if you get the french tips they do it then put a layer of gel over which is really nice,because your nail polish doesn't rub off on the edges it stays there until you go for a fill which with gel you can go every 3 weeks instead of 2!!!!|`|BnhOBmUeaa	well gel goes in ur hair and acrylic nails goe on ur nails
6McDrjTyaa	A way to trick the eye is by keeping your finger nails at a medium almost little longer than natural and painting them a neutral color like very light, mellow pink.|`|shc2YpAAaa	work them out some, and i dont mean text or video games!

I AM A SIZE 4 -5!!!!!!|`|87yovKYlaa	your fingers are proportioned to your hand, if your fingers are swollen then ditch salty foods and drink more water and less carbonated drinks as these will cause you to retain water and make all of you look bigger than you actually are.|`|jGqZdS2xaa	Not that I know of! But its your fingers, I dont think anyone pays much attention to how chubby they are.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps! <3|`|MnzX5quAaa	either let your nails grow, or get your nails done, it will make your fingers look thin|`|VtJcCUvMaa	nope|`|v30TPwUtaa	Cut back of salty foods.
AdTtPLt0aa	Do not pick it or touch it.<br>  Do not wear a band aid while sleeping.<br>  When the scab forms let it stay and it will heal properly. <br>  A scab helps, it blocks germs.|`|THlYgi0Kaa	move out!!!! no duhh!!|`|GS0bpmTxaa	Don't scratch or pick at it. Wait for it to develop a scab and put vaseline on the scab and peel it off. Works for me.

5UV91RCkaa	I can't tell what it looks like,but here are some tips.<br>  <br>  Cream liners are AWESOME!!<br>  Use them with an angled eyeliner brush.  You can get a bold solid line or a thin line.<br>  <br>  If you want a realllly thin line you have to use liquid liner and that might be a little hard unless u practice. <br>  <br>  I hope i helped a little.

WQiTQGdBaa	My hair is really similar to yours, and I recently got long side bangs and layers, and it looks really good! My side bangs go down to about my chin; this way, you can easily put your hair behind your ears or up in a ponytail without having to worry about bangs in your face. The layers in my hair are very subtle: enough to give you volume, but not too much that it is choppy. This look is a little more fun but still easy enough to handle.<br>  <br>  :)  I hope this helps.|`|W4HNrbXvaa	Get it layered but not all the way. Also, get bangs of any kind. Side, front, straight, or lifted. Make sure you are fine with having clips in your hair or something to hold your hair back during sports and more.<br>  <br>  -Hope this helps :]|`|CTxiP8Geaa	i think full bangs in the front would be cool. oooh and layers.|`|vIZNhjIQaa	side bangs i duno|`|shc2YpAAaa	get some layers that can be flipped out or something, and some long bangs that you can clip up when you play.

It depends on what you want.|`|avlVHXDCaa	maybe dye it black<br>  <br>  if no cause i liek it blonde<br>  <br>  layer and side bangs would look cute|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	A medium razor cut, would look great on you. Your hair is not thick enough for a bob, I do not think, at least from what I can tell from your picture. Go to www.beautifulhairstyles.com and scroll down to the bottom for the razor cut-that would look GREAT on you...bangs and all.

d554b20056bafca96e35e0517868c969aa	If you want higher quality make-up that lasts longer, you'll have to spend more than you would on drugstore brands like Maybelline and Cover Girl and Revlon, etc. You can get really good make-up at Sephora and Ulta, I recommend BareMinerals foundation, Make Up Forever eyeliner, Diorshow mascara, MAC eyeshadows, and Nars lipsticks and lip glosses. For the most part, these products will cost between $20 and $30 a pop, sometimes more, but they are of better quality than anything you'll find at a drugstore. The real trick to making your make-up last longer is using primer and removing any oil from your face throughout the day. Smashbox makes a great foundation primer and Too Faced has a pretty good eyeshadow primer. You can also get rice paper sheets at Sephora that will suck up oil from your face without smearing your make-up. Also, use oil-free products for your face, so stay away from oily liquid foundations. Use a powder or mineral foundation that will absorb oil and be less likely to crease and disappear when your face sweats or gets oily. Waterproof mascaras and eyeliners are a good idea, but can be difficult to remove. You can dust a clear powder (such as BareMinerals Mineral Veil) over your eyelashes to help mascara stick better, and dust the same powder over eyeliner to keep it from running. Actually, it's just a good idea to use a finishing powder all over your face to keep make-up in place and to give you a healthy, ethereal glow.|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Put a primer on before you do anything to your face. It helps it stick. Also, there are a lot of mineral veils you can put over your make-up that act like a shield.<br>  As far as eye make-up, instead of using a pencil liner, use a liquid liner (practice a lot before you try to do this before school). They last a lot longer, and are harder to take off (you'll need a make-up remover).<br>  And with eye-shadow if you're getting it clumping in the creases, the primer should help it stick a little more too.<br>  if you're still having issues, try going to Sephora or Mac and see if they can recommend anything for you.|`|50edd02d99399e9e8543b66cc41e9314aa	im exaclty the same the miracles i came across are revlon colorstay foundation.....and waterproof liquid eyeliner and mascara no matter how much u touch it wont budge good luck!!!|`|su6wYQ3Taa	thats the same with me, mine seems to come off so i take my make up to school with me & put it on at dinner time :)|`|PivzKJ8laa	TRY TO USE COVER gIRL THAT SEEMS TO WORk..|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	Well for your face-first wipe your face with blotting sheets. Then use a toner or something to clean the surface and ready it for application. Next apply a face/foundation/concealer primer. This makes the makeup stick to your face better. It preps your face to be a smoother application surface. Also-use a product sometimes called a foundation "veil"-this helps put a seal on your makeup. As for your eyes-I suggest waterproof makeup and an eye base-this is the same idea as the foundation base/primer. The water proof makeup will really help with the watery eyes/tears/humidity/precipitation. If you can PLEASE avoid touching your face-if you must use a blotting sheet-sold at MAC, drugstores, the body shop-etc :) Good luck!|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Makeup primer. I use avons majix
cOtEeVaTaa	Theres really a lot you could do. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out a few different ones.I would check out the review site at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and look around at the reviews.|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	Oil blotting sheets. Primer/base. First in the morning apply as toner-this removes and dirt and oil under the surface of the skin. Apply a primer to help ease the makeup-smoothen the makeup, it helps the makeup glide on to the face a lot easier-therefor there should be no clumps. The oil blotting sheets are going to help you get rid of the excess oil on your face during the day. They are usually made to just pick up oil and not really any makeup. Good luck! :)|`|AJjSEXVbaa	Check out the Bee Luscious Pore Perfecting Primer and Liquid Mineral Foundation. The foundation is oil free and the primer will keep your pores closed but still allow your skin to breath.

AA10531094	1-Do not apply mascara to your bottom lashes. This only “closes” up your eyes.<br>  <br>  2-Use a light colored shadow near the inner corner of your eye.<br>  <br>  3-Use a flesh colored liner on the inner rim of your lower lid and also a small dab at the inner corner of your eye. Flesh colored works better than white because it looks more natural. (3C’s Light Clarifier is perfect! They also have one for darker skin tones!)<br>  <br>  4-Apply a very thin line of eyeliner to the inner rim of the upper lid then widen it out mid-lid. This makes your eyes look more open.<br>  <br>  5-Define your brows with a blended pencil and powder. It really brings attention to your eye and by doing it in conjunction with all of the above, your eyes will really pop.|`|1G0Db60daa	These are really good videos!:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4GVBkicnbU&playnext_from=PL&feature=PlayList&p=F3AC7918380AEE53&playnext=1&index=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4GVBkicn...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJXK5EJEQA&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJXK5EJE...</a>
C0HZ8ZB4aa	Mm, what style are you after? Do you mean you want a proper portrait of your horse? If so, you'll need to find an artist specialising in portraiture and/or animal portraiture if you want a really great piece - I've seen a lot of attempts at portraits (animal and human) by standard tattoo artists that capture zero likeness and personality, and in some places don't even look anatomically correct. I would also suggest a black and grey piece, as opposed to coloured, for the best effect. As for the horseshoe idea - would that mean, with that picture, that the horseshoe would be on it's side? Or do you mean a huge horseshoe encapsulating the entire head? I'm not too sure how well that would work. If you were thinking of a realistic portrait, I think these are classic pieces on their own and with some subtle shadowing, don't really need much in the way of 'jazzing up' as with other tattoo styles, although it might be a nice idea to have the image contained within a decorative oval frame of some sort, like: <a href="http://ny-image0.etsy.com/il_430xN.27638484.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ny-image0.etsy.com/il_430xN.27638...</a> for example. If you were going for the portrait idea, I would recommend you have it at least the size of your hand - and as for placement, it depends, do you have any other tattoos to work with? If you're a blank canvas, I think either central upper back, lower back at side (love handle), ribs or outer thigh would work best. Hope it goes well for you!<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  The lower stomach would look great however is unfortunately not a wise placement for tattoos, particularly with a bigger, detailed and sentimental piece like this. First off - if you ever have children, you run a good risk of distorting the tattoo permanently, and with a portrait this would be difficult to cover or correct. Secondly, even if you do not have children, the stomach is one of the areas most prone to weight fluctuation over the years, and whatever happens to your skin happens to your tattoo. I love tattoos and am desperate for new clear skin haha but even I'm avoiding my abdomen for this reason :-(<br>  <br>  Edit again: although you could theoretically go a bit smaller, I think to get a good level of detail in there and for it to last well over time I would go larger than the size of your fist - if you open out your hand and open your fingers slightly, I'd say this is the optimal size for this sort of design (if you are wanting a realism portrait). I know it can be daunting to go for anything of much size for a first tattoo (not just the pain factor, but most people start out with an idea of just wanting one or two smaller tattoos, it's less common for people to jump straight into having larger tattoos) - but sometimes larger is more effective, depending on the design, and in the tattooing world this still wouldn't be considered a particularly large tattoo really. Obviously you want the tattoo to look the best it can do, and while some things (butterflies etc) can be pulled off large or small, there are other things that look better bigger than smaller. I think if you were going for the 'decorative oval' idea, central between your shoulder blades would look really stunning.|`|6lmFyr2maa	your horse looks gorgeous!

oXnlk1yOaa	something natural.<br>  search on youtube for a natural make up look and it will show you how to do it.|`|OgcdoEDvaa	Do you have a mall near by? At department stores like Macy's, Nordstom's or JC Penny you can go to the cosmetic counters and ask them to do your make up for free. I like Bobbi Brown cosmetics<br>  because they keep the look fairly natural which is good for your age, but you can try Clinique, or Lancome which are also very clean looks. Something like Chanel can be more model looking. Anyway, just tell the make up artist that you are attending the birthday party and that you wanted to try something pretty. I'm sure they will make you look beautiful... and then once home keep practicing what they taught you with your own make up until you feel it looks good.<br>  <br>  Have a great time!|`|bR5r9DMZaa	you don't need makeup you are sooooo pretty!<br>  <br>  if anything, just do a smidge of blush, mascara, and lipstick/ or gloss<br>  <br>  do not wear eyeliner you don't need it!|`|7ki9mfh6aa	do the smokey eyes.<br>  <br>  go on you tube and search smokey eyes, <br>  &<br>  it will show you step by step how to do it.!<br>  <br>  if you dont want that much<br>  maybe just an eyeshadow and MASCARA.<br>  <br>  mascara does ALOTTTT for you eyes!|`|P6H1HAgvaa	try simple eyeliner and makeup. keep it natural and you will look normal but more put together.|`|dPG5dbuMaa	go to the M.A.C website and they ahve a live chat person you can talk to. id say wear brown eyeliner, a brown eyeshadow, blush, foundadion(bareminerals is my fav) and uhh thats it.|`|XxQVSzGiaa	i suggest wearing brighter makeup:]<br>  it will light up your face and show how pretty you are (as corny as it sounds)<br>  kind of like a fade effect...dark clothes, light face!<br>  lighter makeup also frames your face, as well.|`|m3ZvsSZUaa	mascara <br>  and eyeliner <br>  add some blush <br>  curl ur hair (if u want)<br>  and gloss!!!<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnQqz8fNnAioKvblfB_U3gPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309161906AAyN40y">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  mine|`|y6I1f78gaa	Wear something that will really bring your eyes out like a light eyeshadow and some mascara.

But, I would love to help:<br>  <br>  1. Eyeshadow from CoverGirl (can be found at local drug stores) have really pretty bronzes and dark blues. Apply those up until the bone right below your eyebrow. You can also apply it right below the eyelash lightly to give the look an extra flair.<br>  <br>  2. For eyeliner I would go medium amount. Black is a great color and that can be found practically anywhere. Apply to the waterline which is above your bottom eyelashes.<br>  <br>  3. You will need some foundation to keep this all on. This should actually be applied first and it comes in powder and liquid. Liquid stays longer so that means your makeup will too. Make sure the foundation fits your skin tone by sampling some and putting it on your hand. Apply all over.<br>  <br>  4. Blush is easy. It's really your choice what shade you want. I would go with a light, rosy shade for your skin shade. Smile or make a fish face and your cheek bones will pop, then apply on and around them. Make sure you don't go too heavy.<br>  <br>  5. Go with a black mascara to make your eyes pop. Make sure you do all of the top and bottom eyelashes. This is essential because it locks the eyeliner in place<br>  <br>  6. Add sparkles or anything you desire (optional)<br>  <br>  Some things to remember:<br>  -Try the makeup out a couple times before the big day so you don't have a catastrophe<br>  -Always have makeup remover close at hand<br>  -Makeup quality ranges and so do the prices<br>  -If you can't seem to get a hang of it, ask your mom, sister, and friends for advice.<br>  <br>  Have fun!<br>  <br>  -Hope this helps :]|`|Qa3yKIoDaa	curl you eyelashes and then apply mascara.<br>  then apply some brown eyeshadow and some chapstick and you're done!<br>  you should straighten your hair

First, you will want to ensure that all hair products are removed from the hair. You should engage in a thorough washing with shampoo that can clean deep. <br>  <br>  2. Next, it is important to ensure that the hair is soft and flexible. The best way to achieve this is to condition the hair with a product that promises to deliver “full body”. In order to optimize shine and ease of styling, you will want to purchase and implement the use of a spray in conditioner for the hair. You should ensure that each strand is saturated in order to achieve your goal of shine, flexibility, and manageability. <br>  <br>  3. Now, you should brush the hair straight down and pat dry with a towel. You do not want to get it too dry at this point, but you do want to remove any excess moisture before you proceed to the next step. <br>  <br>  4. Now, it is time to apply your favorite brand of mousse on the hair. You should spray the mousse in the palm of your hand and then distribute it as evenly as possible throughout the hair. This will help hold the Alice Cullen pixie hairstyle. In order to achieve this cute and entertaining pixie hairstyle, please adhere to the instructions listed below:<br>  <br>  5. Now, it is time to pull out the hair dryer. As you blow dry the hair, sort of toss it and mess it up a little to ensure that it gets that “unkempt” appearance. You will want to toss her hair forward, and blow dry underneath. You will also want to blow dry the hair from the sides, as well as from the front. The whole idea is to get the hair to look as messy as you possibly can. While this does seem to be an odd way to go initially, it will all come together nicely in the end. <br>  <br>  6. The next step is to take some cream that is referred to as “moulding” and rub it along the top of the head in order to make the top as flat as you can possibly get it. Once you achieve this particular step, you are ready for the next step. <br>  <br>  7. Next, take sections of the hair and pinch them together and then apply moulding cream on these areas. This will help master the “look” that you are attempting to achieve. <br>  <br>  8. Lastly, you will want to take some hairspray and spritz the entire head. This will help hold the style in place. <br>  <br>  That is all there is to creating the Alice Cullen pixie hairstyle! All it takes is a little creativity and time, and you can sport this spectacular style yourself!|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	The technical term is DIAGONAL (forward) Bob. it has been a classic haircut. there is no new name for it . in the 70s and early 80s there was a popular cut as a Diagonal bob (shorter in front longer in back) which is the opposite .|`|cpq5mMW1aa	the hairstyle is call bob :)<br>  here is a picture<br>  <a href="http://www.hairfinder.com/haircollections2/spring-hairstyle-3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairfinder.com/haircollection...</a>|`|CI44wFWSaa	It is called "Angeled Bob"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Like this?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.topnews.in/files/Victoria-Beckham12.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.topnews.in/files/Victoria-Bec...</a>|`|tBW29710aa	Ya it's a bob.

FIOOKpz0aa	Your family most likely is right, when you get older and you realize more people are looking at them you'll become more self-concious about them|`|RvVvaVsAaa	youre stupid. and im SURE you look bad if youre not plucking or waxing your eyebrows, they have a damn reason to say what theyr saying. just get them waxed already. and study your grammar, the wording SUCKS in this question.|`|PAZWfnFtaa	Not a big deal if you do or don't shape your brows.  If you feel like it, just get it done wherever you get your hair cut.  After that, you can just tweeze where the strays pop up so you don't over-tweeze.|`|ezKzYsq0aa	so if you family is saying that your eyebrows are fuzzyfull and you don't like it, tell them to stop.<br>  <br>  if you want to make your eyebrows look better, then i suggest that you either get them waxed or try to get it threaded. waxing doesnt hurt and threading hurts a little bit; its like a pinching feeling. but you'll get used to it after you try it a couple of times. <br>  <br>  if you dont want to try any of that stuff now, then dont worry about it. you can do it when you're older.|`|eMFYNGI2aa	tell them to stick it, but if everyones bugging you about them, I mean you sound pretty young, but you might want to let them, I mean I haven't seen them, but some eyebrows need to be trimmed and given shape, they don't necessarily have to do it every week or anything, but maybe you should just let it go... tell them to bug off and when you're ready for 'em you'll let them know, until then tell them to go worry bout their own eyebrows|`|pWoMaxwkaa	If you're indians you're going to have a hard time with it through your whole life.

Ugh , I think you need them waxed/threaded.|`|GOSMZMpwaa	maybe you should just trim them if they are such an eyesore to everyone..<br>  <br>  thats how to get them to stop making remarks|`|78z7gk7naa	Well, people usually see perfect plucked eyebrows attractive. Many people think bush eyebrows is a turnoff.<br>  <br>  To make them stop: Let them trim your eyebrows, or just tell them your happy the way you are.<br>  <br>  And to get them trimmed, you can easily pluck them. It stings, but at least your eyebrows will look better :]|`|HbHFJ2EXaa	if you don't want to then don't wax, or tweeze them them<br>  just tell your family to shut up with it<br>  and just don't pay attention to them<br>  and you could always point out things that are wrong with them|`|RvwJcvZDaa	If you don't want to don't do it! Tell them you are sick of them making comments about it!

Just don't get too upset about it :)|`|LKZlcjgVaa	Well, its mainly your choice. Though Im sure they just want the best for you. You can just simply try talking to them, making them understand that you feel no need to do so. Explaining that its your choice and that untrimmed eyebrows are not a big deal. Im sure they would understand if you explained how you feel. <br>  Even so with time you might even change your own opinion and considering your parents advice.<br>  good luck|`|AA11820313	thick eyebrows are good but if they're thicker than this girl's brows, its time to wax. tweezing hurts more than waxing, in my opinion, and it stings. waxing just burns.|`|FSOI5jbsaa	it doesn't really hurt you to trim your eyebrows, i would if i had fuzzyfull (lol) eyebrows...<br>  just tell them, they should respect you for you are. and it's your decision :) hope i helped!|`|IxOFUv2Yaa	Just get your eyebrows trimmed then its not that bad plus it looks better next time you go to a salon asked them to wax or pluck them i would chooses to get them waxed it hurts less.|`|30xRk9EUaa	when you go get you hair cut get them to pluck or wax em for you
7PUmsocmaa	Choosing A Brand And Colour<br>  <br>  Hey there are so many great brands out there! Regardless of which brand you use remember: don’t apply to much product (you can add more later if needed), start off with a lighter colour and then move on to the darker levels if you skin handles them well.<br>  <br>  My Favourite DIY Brands:<br>  <br>  Le Tan Mouse<br>  St Tropez Mouse <br>  Vani-t Liquid Sun spray on tan<br>  Skinwear spray on tan or mouse<br>  Dove, Johnson and Johnson gradual tanner<br>  <br>  How to DIY fake tan:<br>  1. In the days leading up to you tan exfoliate your skin with a body scrub and exfoliating gloves/loofa<br>  2. Make sure you have done any hair removal: 8 hours prior for shaving and 48 hours prior for waxing (this will help prevent streaking and irritation) and do not wear any deodorants, moisturisers or perfumes<br>  3. Remember to wear gloves or wash hand every few minutes with tan remover<br>  4. Using a small amount of product start at your ankles and use small circular movements. I find that the mousse tans are the easiest to apply however many people have great success with a spray on aerosol can. <br>  5. Remember not to get wet or do anything that will cause you to sweat for at least 8 hours after applying your tan. <br>  6. After at least 8 hour shower<br>  7. After your first shower tan remember to moisturise as much as possible, ideally twice a day! This will make the tan last a lot longer!<br>  Professional Spray Tan<br>  <br>  The easiest option is a professional spray tan it will take under 5 minutes to apply and will look streak free and gorgeous. Also a good salon will have a range of brands and colour options and will be able to help you choose the best brand for your skin type. Check out the new mobile spray tanning businesses that will come to your home (with a pop up booth) usually for around the same price as going to a salon. <br>  <br>  My Favourite Professional Brands: (always start with lightest colour)<br>  Vani-t Liquid Sun<br>  Skinwear/Oz Bronz<br>  Black Magic <br>  Envogue<br>  Naked Tan (you only need to leave this product on for 2 hours rather than the traditional 8!!)<br>  <br>  <br>  Make Your Tan Last Longer<br>  1. Moisturise, moisturiser, moisturise<br>  2. Avoid long hot showers<br>  3. Avoid swimming, saunas and spas<br>  4. Avoid shaving|`|lxXOkc5Kaa	i would vote for a spray on mystic tan, if you get it done at a tanning saloon it shouldn't look uneven or fake.. stay away from the do it yourself lotions though, they are a disaster!|`|52yZwf0aaa	go to meetmark.com and get this face shimmer it is awsome good luck|`|hRZKCDYPaa	tell your mom to go to hell and use the tanning bed... or if not just go to the beach duhhhhh ... why u even ask this ???|`|Rkrx6GW7aa	On a sunny weekend put tanning loation on and lay out on your yard!<br>  Mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au1BcbB9wm_ne6AbfcLse.vsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309160853AAlHteW">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

Realise that these ladies have personal shoppers and (practically) unlimited budgets, and recieve clothing from all over the world. <br>  <br>  In looking at Miley's style (I'll assume you're talking about her offstage looks), it seems that her casual looks aren't exactly "bohemian", in truth, she's all over the place. Some of her looks are vintage inspired (which is perhaps where you see the "bohemian"). Charlotte Russe and Forever21 are two great places to find dresses, tops, skirts, shorts, jeans and accessories which are not overly-expensive and will start you in the right direction. Often, it's less about one single look and more about certain kinds of clothing that they wear. What you percieve to be their "style" is actually what they have found that looks good on their body and the things that they like and have stuck with. Remember: They have the funds to just constantly change things out, purchasing newer versions of whatever they want.<br>  <br>  The best thing for you to do as a fan, is to study their fashion habits; their silhouettes (the overall shapes of the clothes they wear) and trademarks (does she always wear sunglasses? Is she never seen without a scarf around her neck or in her hair?). I'm sure you must know alot about their style...more than you realise. Remember, though that we're all different and your body shape or type might be different than these ladies (everyone is "different"...this doesn't mean"better" or "worse") <br>  <br>  Learning about their style and comparing it to your own is also cool. The most important thing: Don't forget to express who YOU are in the way you dress. That's what makes it so much fun! You can show your appreciation for their style, just remember the most important part: You. I can't express that enough.<br>  <br>  A few links to get you started:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forever21.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forever21.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.charlotterusse.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlotterusse.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.instyle.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.instyle.com</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The first two are stores, which will give you ideas. Don't be afraid just to look around. It's really fun to just play around with it like a game. Once you learn where to look, it will become even more fun. Practice looking at outfits they wear, and then finding affordable solutions. The last site I listed has an area which will show you how they came up with "looks for less"; matching a celebrity look, but with affordable options. This should get you started. Just don't ever feel you ever have to look exactly like any celebrity. It's really up to you (and what your parents allow). The best weapon is knowledge of clothing. Learning about different styles, cuts and basic fashion terminology will definitely help you become a better dresser; now and in the future.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Enjoy yourself, and don't be afraid to jump in (looking/comparing). That's often the most enjoyable part. You might even discover your own "style"!|`|0Wf3Au4kaa	<a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbanoutfitters.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.anthropologie.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.anthropologie.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.forever21.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forever21.com</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I hate Miley Cyrus.<br>  <br>  Neutral on Taylor Swift.|`|ECaqY67Iaa	Forever 21.

ojceQQ1Paa	Do not use neosporin or rubbing alcohol or peroxide.  Those items are too harsh to use on new piercings and will dry it out making it itch even more.  I would try doing sea salt soaks (take 1 tsp sea salt to 1 cup of warm water and soak it with a cotton ball). Make sure to clean it with a mild antibacterial soap and pat dry.  Do not scratch it.|`|6CMfKxiMaa	sea salt|`|d554b20056bafca96e35e0517868c969aa	Stop using the saline and Spectro gel and get some unscented antibacterial Dial (you can find it at any grocery or drugstore, it's a deep amber-orange color) and clean the area with that until you can get to a piercing place and get some Provon medical-grade soap. You can also get this online, but it'll take longer to get to you because of processing and shipping and all that good stuff. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that sternum piercings are surface piercings, and surface piercings are VERY difficult to heal. In face, they never truly heal, they are basically an open wound until you remove them. The area will probably always be irritated to an extent.|`|hERbZ7yjaa	Well at least your cleaning it correctly. Haha. <br>   <br>   Thats normal hon. Especially with where the piercing is (alot of sweat goes down in that area.) <br>  <br>   You might want to try laying off on the saline for a tad bit. Maybe just once before bed? Other times water + Dial antibacterial soap.|`|b58uhcneaa	Try using hydrogen peroxide and neosporine instead of saline and spectro gel. you want to make sure you keep the bacteria and dirt out of your skin|`|hRZKCDYPaa	lick it bby ;)

9e7f34ca42b0bc7a01f44825b1539e5eaa	No, the only real way to fade freckles besides time fading them  is laser resurfacing. There are freckle fading creams out there but you have to use them forever for it to actually work , and even then as soon as you stop using it they come back as they were to begin with . It's easier to just wear make up|`|AA10063288	They will fade on their own or try lemon juice. My freckles are all gone including the ones around my mouth. I miss them. :(
SiZisNHGaa	That just means that the blood vessals and cappilaries  in your cheeks are quite close to the surface of your skin. I have it too, there is not a whole lot you can do about it although some foundations, moisturisers and concealers have a green base in them and this nuetralises the redness. I would ask at a makeup counter or a pharmacy.<br>  <br>  I use La Roche Posay moisturiser, its green in colour and is called something like Rosacea...it has definatly calmed it down!!|`|7vR6VpsXaa	OMG, thats how mine is.<br>  I have no idea why.<br>  It won't go away. Soooo annoying.<br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe its just cause our skin is sensative <br>  and we wash our face so much.<br>  If thats what you do.|`|Hj6SFfK7aa	It happens to me too. I read somewhere that it's hormones. It will supposedly calm down when the hormones calm down. I blush at random times too. My skin also gets red because it is sensitive.|`|JCG36VRVaa	that happens to me too!!<br>  <br>  just remember you ow your not nervous and think confident!<br>  <br>  dont worry lots of people go through that

6CMfKxiMaa	well. the piercing itself, isn't all that bad. and I mean, i got my nose right after it too, so i'm sure you can handle it.<br>  but the healing.<br>  is a major *****<br>  you have to be careful about Everything<br>  theres no way you can sleep on that side of your face<br>  it's hard to wash your hair because you hit it<br>  it gets really sore<br>  it's just a bunch of OW<br>  but you know what<br>  it's worth it<br>  and it's going to be like that for like 3 months or more.<br>  ahh well.<br>  but what i heard (haven't tried) is that you get two rings instead of a barbell to the pain isn't as bad. for cleaning you just use sea salt. you can't change it until it's completely healed and to even be sure go back to your piercer and have them change it for you

It doesnt hurt that bad but it does take some time to heal.  also they will tell you it takes up to 6 months to completley heal.  but just my opinion.. dont do this yourself you need to let a pro do this.|`|ZYyzCeoeaa	DO NOT EVER pierce your stomach have you not read around the subject to see that this is a very stupid thing to do?<br>  <br>  How can you NOT trust someone who trained to pierce and tell you how to look after it, in the best way possible.<br>  <br>  You want it done in the most safe way possible get it done properly it only costs ￡30|`|9qSF7zT3aa	Please, please please, don't do it yourself.

I ended up getting it at 19. You should get it. It doesn't hurt because it doesn't have time to hurt. It goes really fast. I think you are crazy if you try to do it yourself. You dont trust professionals? That is why they are called professionals b/c they are trained properly on how to do things like this. They have all they're certifications and licensing so they are able and legal to do it. You would probably have to take courses and training like them just to get the stupid gun. It is affordable and easy and safe. Just go into the salon, pick the ring your want and go from there. Most places charge by the ring you buy. Depending on if you get sterling silver, 14k gold, etc. They will give you some stuff to keep it clean, and ointments you use for like a week and go from there. <br>  Good luck!|`|czAbrzcUaa	You think you'll be better than someone who has been specifically trained to do that?<br>  Ha, good luck kiddo.|`|tuXBPrjsaa	NO NO NO! do not do it yourself.<br>  <br>  my friend did that when she was really young and her belly button rotted out. <br>  <br>  get it professionally done. dont even think about it.

ZQbXSkTkaa	Personally I think leggings should be worn under skirts and dresses. They don't look good on anyone but very very thin girls and even then many girls need to check their leggings out in light areas, so as to make sure they are not see through.

I would stray away from the ridiculously long side-swept emo bangs a la alex evans.  You still want people to see your eyes, cause they're lovely.

4Ug9FdFdaa	As long as you stay out of the water until the tatoo is completely healed it will be fine, the water is not what messes it up, it is the chemicals in the water like chlorine and what not.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	At least a month for bath/spa/pool/lake/ocean<br>  <br>  and yeah 2 hours will be fine for a shower just don't let the water constantly beat against the tattoo.<br>  <br>  This is what can happen. <br>  <br>  1. Lakes are nasty its a breeding ground for bacteria. It will get your tattoo infected if you don't wait until its completely healed.<br>  <br>  Now with everything else it's not exactly the chemicals. <br>  <br>  Think what happens to a scab when its submerged in water?<br>  It gets gooey, and falls off. Well when that scab on your tattoo falls off it pulls the color with it. So thats why you need to wait to go in a pool or bath..etc|`|H3PcFertaa	At least 1 month. Your tattoo should not be soaked in water or put under direct streams of water while healing (generally 2 - 4 weeks or more). And even if your tattoo seems healed, it isn't totally deep down healed for up to 6 months. You must have no doubt that it is not vulnerable in any way. After the initial healing you should wear sunblock whenever in the sun also.<br>  And you must take into consideration that it is normal and fairly common to need a touch up after the 1st healing, which means another several weeks of healing and aftercare. And too, if you have a large or complicated tattoo, that it may take more than one session with a few weeks healing time in between.<br>  If you can not do this, it would be better for the tattoo to wait until you can.<br>  Think it through carefully.<br>  good luck~|`|ZkrGttKaaa	I guarantee that you're not going to like my answer. You can get in the water for short periods of time, (five or ten minutes, max) but, just like the bath or shower, no extended stays.  This should be for around two weeks. That's about how long most people take to heal up. Also, and this is critical, you better have sunblock, at least 30, on that tatt. And the sunblock will work just as well as anything else you would use to heal it up. You really don't wanna know what a freshly done tattoo feels like with a bad case of sunburn. I've done it, and never again! Take care, my friend.|`|cd0b3bbd8df141c2851cdda176199d30aa	<a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Will_water_damage_a_new_tattoo" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Will_water_dam...</a><br>  <br>  :)|`|s4q8M2fAaa	dont' take a bath, don't soak in water for about a month.<br>  wait to shower for 2+ hours|`|g1nPfYD7aa	i would suggest until its not sore anymore.<br>  my ex boyfriend got a tattoo & went swimming that same day & it got infected with things that looked like pimples. it left scars on the tat & now its ruined.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck & i hope i helped.<br>  :)|`|2x6Tafpdaa	when i got my tattoo it was no soaking it until it was healed and no sunbathing,shower was ok 2 hours later|`|AdZfpbHPaa	don't soak in water for about two weeks
Hk39AkNGaa	No, Barbwire is very offencive to people such as me, because it means you support war.. I don't think you should tattoo yourself because tattoos are permanent and they are not erasable, my parents regret ever getting tattoos as Teens.<br>  <br>  Yet If you want to go for it, im just telling you to think of yourself in the future, and see if you will still like having them.<br>  <br>  There are many disadvantages of tattoos, people only get them for fashion/style. But too me it does nothing, its just their on your wrist.<br>  <br>  If I were to meet a guy with a tattoo, i wouldn't be so-in-to them that much, maybe i would think differently of you. Because what you choose to do to Your body, reflects what you are inside. If you tatto yourself with guns, but your over all a nice guy. That wont reflect it with guns as tattoos.<br>  <br>  You can still try if you want to though...Im not holding you back if you really want to do it.|`|1hciyvKdaa	It shows he has no clue that his overall appearance in life, can keep great jobs and opportunities out of his reach.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	not really popular but if you like it then get it.|`|otsuH97Jaa	in my experience, small tattoos like that wear out and dull so much faster because the wrist is used so much. i'd rethink the location, but if you don't mind I think it sounds pretty cool. wire moreso than stitches.|`|j2VDYbeoaa	Not sure, but I have a friend with a unique tattoo- a circle of deer hoof prints around his upper arm.

Before she was a Mother she was a woman, and she still is. She probably put her fun, sexy side away while you and your sister were growing up, but probably feels that now you're a little older she can be herself a little again! <br>  <br>  Just think - as soon as you have kids are you going to become all modest?

IuP9LZZUaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA... moron. What are you thinking? "Can I dye my hair black by lighting it on fire?" What the hell do you think? QUESTION ANSWERED!|`|z2TjjnxVaa	There's no way to colour your hair if you have black hair without bleaching it. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but you need to lift your black colour before you can even think about adding more colour.|`|5HVx8P57aa	wait do you want it super blue like very noticeable?<br>  because there is no other way to dye black hair|`|32GXDiNFaa	You could try, but it would wash right out. It also probably wouldn't show up so well on black hair. I wanted to dye part of my hair red, and my hair is only medium brown, and I had to bleach it. But, I used this special bleach for brown hair, which you have to get at a professional salon. I'm sure they have bleach for black hair too.Your best bet would be to get hair dye at the grocery store. It's cheap and it really does work.|`|cCnXyNs6aa	i tried it on my dogs hair. its black to. i used red dye and it showed up brown. it was cute. all i did was make the dye like u would for dyeing eggs. like it should say on the box. then rubbed it all over the dogs hair and waited for like 30 to 40 mins then washed it out only with water, no soap. then it worked. it didnt show up red like i wanted but it still showed up really well and it was really cute too. it lasted for like 3 weeks. but it was cute. i use to food color so it dont hurt my doggie. good luck hope it works for u. i dont bleach my hair either i dont wanna damage it.|`|MrEVQFWsaa	Go for it!<br>  <br>  I guess you'd just do it as normal.

jUaSbfhJaa	try months!<br>  <br>  Don't bleach your hair from black to peroxide, you'll regret it soon enough.<br>  <br>  You better have time for this... could take ages because you're going from top to bottom and meeting up halfway took me ages.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|lc2WYfeTaa	To be honest it could take a month to two months!! Because you can't do it all at once and you can only lighten so much per visit at the salon!!! And in between these visits you will need to recondition your hair!!! It's a long process!! Just make sure it's what you really want!!! Going back to black is a process too.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	If you go to a quality salon, they will not do it. This much processing is TERRIBLE for your hair and a true professional will refuse to cause this much damage, knowing you will not be happy with the result. If you go to a salon that is unprofessional enough to do this, it will take hours. Again, you will not be happy with the result|`|kYgvMsYbaa	My hair was natural darkish brown and it took me months. You have to be very commited to having bleach blonde hair and its pretty expensive but worth it if its done well. It will cause a hell of alot of damage and will take along time if its dyed black! My hair was died a blackish colour ( which i was growing out ) But they refused to dye it because of all the damage and how long it would take..also my hair would go orange! I had my hair cut short and all the black dye cut off. I love my hair now, its grown and is a white blonde :)|`|z2TjjnxVaa	Just prepare yourself for the worst stages your hair will go through. <br>  <br>  It also depends on what type of hair you have. One of my friends is Chinese and she went from black to platinum...well it broke right off.<br>  I never thought the 'break' off rumour was true....thankfully she just did a row of funky bleach blonde and it all broke off so it just looked like she never dyed it to begin with.<br>  <br>  You'd need to do it in multiple stages with a few weeks inbetween. Just be prepared for your hair to be orange on the way to platinum blonde!|`|klTgOEcpaa	like 4 trip to  the hair salon your hair will be totally damaged|`|fjSfBBDsaa	This is a process u do NOT want to do at home. A salon is needed.. depending on the healtyness of your hair it could take 2 visits. White blond is very hard to get when going for black. Also depends if your hair is dyed or naturally black, and the store bought stuff is harder to get through. Make sure the hairdresser u go to knows what she is doing and has experience in that department. i learnt the hard way|`|vcjlwlD7aa	It can take a while. you half to do it in steps, so you don't fry your hair. <br>  If your hair is black from color, it could be harder and take longer. Black is hard to get out of the hair, if it's not natural.|`|6McDrjTyaa	Probably a couple hours, I mean BLACK to WHITE, it's gonna take a while, they'll probably have to bleach your hair, on top of that it's pretty pricey.|`|jL6ppXqNaa	I'd say weeks. It would take multiple trips to go from black to platinum, and some hair dressers won't do it.|`|zrYsSUQYaa	VERY long unless you want your hair damaged!
s4q8M2fAaa	7/16 is the size after 00. how long have you been at 00? you might have to let them settle for a little bit first. best to do it right after you get out of the shower, because your skin is more elastic at that point. don't force them too hard, you can damage your earlobe and cause blow outs|`|tmSGGJIOaa	guages are disgusting and ur not gunna want a hole in ur ear so big that u can poke ur finger throguh by the time ur 50|`|XaYHMNusaa	Yes 7/16 is the size after 00g.  You probably aren't ready to stretch up yet.|`|3QvHE3JZaa	maybe it's just your body's way of telling you to stop there.<br>  either you're ears weren't ready to be stretched and you need to wait longer or that's just as big as your ears will go..
2T49GGLKaa	sorry hon but you have to be able to straighten ur hair if you want to do that.<br>  <br>  however, if you can straighten ur hair, tie it into loose twists, then sllep on them, the more twists the curlier|`|jj3gaWHiaa	spray your hair with salty water|`|32GXDiNFaa	You're not going to be able to get waves without a straightener/curling iron.

QQY7FImlaa	Yeah! I think you would look great in side swept bangs. A few things to keep in mind if you're really going to get them. Consider which side to make them sweep depending on the way you tilt your head when you write or something. I once got my bangs on the wrong side and every time I tilted my head when I was writing, it got in the way! Plus, I would also recommend getting the bottom of your hair thinned because it looks heavy (or maybe its just because the bottom of your pic is blurred). Anyway, good luck!|`|NGHdmQwoaa	yeah it would look super cute get them to your left side though<br>  and btw your not ugly your cute =)|`|t7HUMcOCaa	Side bangs are amazing, I would definitely recommend them to everyone.

5318c2d46c71911df8843e0c385cf271aa	Think Audrey Hepburn. It's not about fitting into trends or buying clothes that are expected. I shop at Banana Republic and some of their stuff is fabulous. I have a look all my own. You don't have to wear dress pants or anything. It's about looking sexy without being a call for attention. It's about setting yourself apart from the crowd. Wear heels with a cute outfit (not in a trashy way!) to make yourself seem more feminine. Check yourself on modesty and tact. Try to be a good person and do some volunteer work. Don't be afraid to get a little grungy, but do it classily. For instance, I do dance but I try to put together a cute look. I usually dress in 80's wear. :) Even Audrey Hepburn wore sweatpants and a frumpy sweatshirt, but she would do something cute with her hair. Wear skirts and dresses with stockings too.

That is the unit of measurement used to describe the size of the rings. The jewelry in question is a captive bead ring, also known as a CBR.

WAk41IUSaa	i'm 13 (almost 14, yay!!) and i wear concealer where i need it (under eye circles, the occasional pimple) the one i use for under eye circles is called covergirl fresh complexion undereye concealer, and the one i use for pimples is Neutrogena SkinClearing Oil free concealer.  it has acne medication so it treats pimples while covering them up, which is totally GENIUS!!! Both concealers work really well for me. <br>  <br>  then I use powder foundation because it's much better for ur skin (liquid foundation SERIOUSLY messes up ur skin and makes u age faster)  the stuff that i use is called L'oreal Bare naturale mineral foundation and it has SPF 19 in it which is always good.  It also makes my face look really fresh, and if i want more coverage (usually i only use a little for school) I can build the coverage and it doesn't look cakey at all.  I absolutely LOVE IT!!<br>  <br>  I don't use bronzer, but if you find the right color, and know how to apply it, you can't really go wrong.  Look for a color that's 3 shades darker than your skin and apply it in a 3 , check out this vid: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O292uSyCILY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O292uSyCI...</a> <br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|AA11820313	the best foundation i've ever tried is PurMinerals. it's a 4-in-1 foundation (concealer, foundation, spf, and powder). its not powdery, lasts all day, controls shine, and flaws. you can find it @ Ulta. 2nd best = Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse Foundation. best bronzer = Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse Bronzer. Maybelline can be found @ all drugstores, Walmart, and Target. =)|`|8aH0Ul1taa	The best brand is MAC.I personally love MAC.There are many more brands that could be better but I think they might break your budget.Chanel and MakeupForever have good foundations too.It is very good stuff and it really won't break you out.|`|CY6ZevNoaa	i use maybeline mineral pwer makeup powder blended with nivea soft lotion so it looks super natural!|`|swxiulwtaa	I use<br>  Foundation from Bare Minerals (it's powder)<br>  Concealer Boi-ing from Benefit<br>  They both do well. If your someone who buys from drugstores though then I don't know|`|64O0ydUfaa	Yeah I'm 13, too.  I've been wearing makeup since the start of 6th grade.  I just recently started wearing foundation and I absolutely fell in love with it!  It's light to medium coverage, so it doesn't hide my freckles, and it stays on really long as well.  It's called Almay TLC Truly Lasting Color... As for bronzer, I don't wear any but I do like the Almay Smart Shade blushes so you could try the bronzer from them, and as for concealer I have yet to find one that works well.  But with the foundation, I highly doubt you will need the concealer, just as I don't need it anymore :) hahhaha I know I wrote a lot hah<br>  <br>  <br>  xox Emily Sarah xox

That way you won't notice the polish, and when you try to bite your nails it will taste terrible. My friend once had this stuff her mom would put on her nails and you really couldn't see it. Also, you could get fake tips until your nails grow out.

Also-- sper plus tampons.  <br>  It can also be that your body is still adjusting to getting your period :-/<br>  BIRTH CONTROL IS THE BEST THOUGH|`|9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	Yeah... I'm not sure how you can REDUCE blood flow, but try like.. Playtex Sports brand tampons.. they're made for athletic people who move a lot, and have pretty good protection.|`|hRZKCDYPaa	well .. buy the super size tampons .... put it in and put a pad under it ... after that take pills for the pain .. and drink lots of water.. thatle do the trick.. o and after u do that .. drink monster(an energy drink)|`|rhTCejrtaa	ibuprofen is a blood thinner, that helps me with the heavy parts and pain.|`|8vQH5AhTaa	hi well so you play sports get the kind that say sport that might help and drink water|`|b58uhcneaa	i know exactly what you are going through. i myself am on the track team and i had my period during districts for goodness sake! The reason your period is unpredictable is because athletes like yourself and me have a higher level of testosterone in our system (not a bad thing). Keep plenty of tampons on hand, and it helps to wear whatever tampon you are comfortable with and a pad together. Its not blood you are losing (although it may look like it) it is actually the lining of your uterus cleaning itself out. Bananas help with cramps and such. Don't drink gatorade, it will make the cramps worse. Plenty of water, and eat a bit more than you usually would. Good Luck
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	If you're loosing more than 100 hairs a day then it is considered serious hair loss, with many hair follicles resting at once, its best that if this is a long-term problem that you see a doctor. Fact is there are foods you can eat and treatments you can use, both natural and store bought (which are expensive), but a doctor will be able to find the cause and recommend the right treatment for you. This is better than wasting time, effort and money on treatments that may not work and will just leave you feeling more distressed about your hair loss. Your hair not growing is something different to hair loss, it means that your hair is in its resting stage and nothing can be done about that but for you to wait until it is active again and starts to grow again. <br>  <br>  Look at possible causes yourself so you can work on dealing with them yourself, as well as with the help of your doctor. Normally you'd look at stress as a possible cause, if you do suffer from stress address that and try to avoid stressful situations or plan ahead to be able to deal with them better. As a note B-vitamins are helpful for dealing with stress, as too is St. Johns Wort although it can't be taken if you are using oral contraceptives as it can make them less effective. Hormones are another aspect, an underactive thyroid gland can lead to reduction in production of the hormone thyroxine – iodine-rich foods can help. Diet is a big factor, if you have a poor diet including using fad diets, have recently become vegetarian or suffer from an eating disorder these will all seriously effect your hair, specifically a sudden drop in iron or too much vitamin A. For healthy hair keep a healthy diet with a lot of protein-rich foods such as fish, chicken, dairy, pulses and nuts – multivitamins can be helpful, so too can flaxseed oil in capsule form taken daily. <br>  <br>  I'm a strong advocate for head massage, it improves health of your hair and scalp through improved circulation, and this will also help with hair loss. Mix together 2 drops basil essential oil, 2 drops rosemary essential oil and 10ml of avocado oil, pop it in a little dark glass bottle then when ready to use it heat the bottle up in a bowl of warm water. Before washing your hair massage this mix into your scalp in small, gentle circular motions and leave for 30 minutes – it's easy to do and will help, it's worth trying for the hair loss and will improve your hairs health in general.|`|SDBP3XQLaa	1.Try mizani leave in conditioner and night treatment<br>  <a href="http://www.mizani-usa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mizani-usa.com/</a><br>  2.Try Dr. Miracles I know what you are thinking.

But you said you didn't pierce it so. If I were you, I would wait until it heals and go for it again. And just push it really hard one time through. No stopping. If your really squeamish about it, have a trustworthy friend do it. They won't hold back :D|`|MF58hLCmaa	Piercing it yourself is absololutely disgusting and nearly impossible.<br>  It hurts horribly bad, and it runs a huge risk of infection.<br>  <br>  If possible, get a needle meant for piercing.<br>  Put an apple on the back of your ear, and get someone to shove it through for you.<br>  Quicker that way.|`|mOnQhMy2aa	well you should probably get a brand new needle to make sure its really really sharp oh and something i found helpful when i did mine, gt a slice of apple and put it behind your earlobe, its firm enough to let you push but then once the hole is pierced the needle just goes right through|`|AA11474773	well... as a female with 8 piercings... three on each ear, my tongue and belly button... difference is i got all mine professionally done... if i was u i would definately wait till they heal and are NOT sore anymore... as for the crunching sound... i suggest getting a sharper needle... heating the needle is a must but ensure it is clean... its also smart to get a friend to push the needle through... people tend to chicken out and not push as hard.. its human nature no matter how badly you want it done lol.... <br>  <br>  <br>  anyways... i hope these things helped ya... like i said... make sure your ears are healthy and not in pain.... good luck =) <br>  <br>  <br>  Princess =)|`|Q2qNu2N3aa	haha, i love the responses telling you how dumb it was.<br>  i have a ton of piercings, and i've pierced my earlobes myself twice.<br>  i simply used a sewing needle, (stupid, maybe) but it worked out well.<br>  all i did, was mark where i wanted it and then slowly pushed the needle through. i don't recommend using ice, it'll make the skin tougher to go through, and probably hurt worse. but wait until it heals up a bit, so that it's not so sore anymore :)<br>  <br>  <br>  ohh, and IF they get infected, you will NOT have to necessarily go to the doctor. hahah, dumbass.<br>  just make sure to clean them with peroxide and possibly put some kind of antibacterial ointment on them, to help them heal :)|`|wSYhEREjaa	ok i did the same thing you did with my 2nd holes. one ear worked out great but then the other one just wouldn't go through! i don't know what was wrong with it but it just wouldn't go through, i wouldn't mess with it, let it heal. And i know you said you can't get it professionally done but i suggest it, if the reason you can't get them done is your parents then just get them done anyway, there's nothing better than rebeling : )<br>  <br>  ?|`|05ff5bb18eb4c096ef430ca99d7dad2daa	If professional isn't an option you shouldn't do it. The needle used isn't a sewing needle, it's a hollow needle which limits the surrounding damage and removes some of the soft cartilage of your earlobe. Seriously, you will only end up with a scar and have learned. Don't do it, you don't know how to and could get an infection from not having a sterile setting. Please don't, it's for your own health.

MehqmwZXaa	I used to have the exact same problem. <br>  <br>  Here's what you have to do:<br>  * Wash your hair whenever your roots are oily.<br>  * Never apply shampoo to your ends, only to your roots. <br>  * Don't scrub too hard when you wash your hair.<br>  * Use a mild shampoo (if you don't know which one to choose, ask a dermatologist what product is best for you hair type)<br>  * Condition every time you wash your hair, or everyday. <br>  * Don't apply conditioner to your roots. <br>  * Comb your hair in the shower (with a wide tooth comb) before rinsing the conditioner out (reduces tangles and therefore, frizz)<br>  * Don't brush you hair while it's wet (creates frizz)<br>  * Don't brush you hair at all, unless your hair is straight or not very wavy.<br>  * Don't rub your hair when you towel dry it (creates frizz)<br>  * If you use serum or any other styling product, don't apply it to your roots. <br>  <br>  Remember, there's nothing wrong in washing your hair everyday as long as you use a mild shampoo and condition properly. If you have oily hair, you'll have no choice but to keep washing everyday. <br>  <br>  I asked my dermatologist and she said that washing hair everyday doesn't make it oilier. <br>  <br>  Ok, I think I'm forgetting anything.<br>  <br>  I hope I've helped =)

AA11053088	LOL! I had mine does when I was 15, and I used my sister Candie's i.d.! To hide it for a long time, until my nephew was sitting on my tummy, and raised my shirt. <br>  I hid it, but not wearing extremely tight shirts like I always did. I toned it down. Also, I stopped wearing low low rise jeans. But try to keep your wardrobe the same, but kind of change it up, like stop wear shirts that totally expose your tummy. It maybe hard, knowing it's spring break, but just do it, and wear your normal clothes, but always make sure your belly button is covered. <br>  When my mom seen my belly piercing, she cried. And everyone knows, seeing your mom cry is the worst! <br>  And when you go swimming, pick out an extreamly cute one piece. I bought a swimsuit that was a one piece, but from the back, it looked like a bikini. Your parentals will never know!<br>  Or a good retainer can do it. (But you'll still see it.) Wear a bikini, and let your mom see how cute it is. After my strict mother seen it, she thought it was cute, and let me keep it!|`|fac02e73d704362ef8a06b52d3b05b0baa	Well, it's hard to hide something on your belly while swimming unless it's covered by a one piece. You could try to put a retainer in it because they are usually clear but it still might be noticeable.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Wear a one piece.|`|1a0a9c3915db9727fed7a170d97dae79aa	one piece, tankini, and just dont lift up your shirt.|`|6npsRIzUaa	Why on earth did you get pierced without your parents permission in the first place? The 'get a one piece' suggestions are nice, but if the one piece fits popular the jewelry WILL be noticeable underneath it. Wear a loose fitting T-shirt and watch that it stays down over your tummy. The hole that's left when the jewelry is out should not be so noticeable that your parents will look at you and say 'omg OMG you got pierced!', when I take out any of my piercings no one that knows any better would think I used to have one in. But then again it might close up if you take it out. <br>  <br>  Here's a crazy idea: just tell your parents what you did and then you can stop hiding it. And if they make you take it out, then well, that's what you get for not listening and not respecting their wishes.|`|hT0frTVZaa	The truth is there is no way of hiding the holes that the piercing made if you want to wear a bikini even if you take the jewelry out, so your going to have to wear a tankini or try using a retainer they sell them wherever you can get body jewely.|`|pgmXNpuOaa	if you still wanna wear a cute bathing suit when you swim and dont want them to see then get a cute monokini they are sooo cute and will hide your bellybutton ring|`|goA1h6Cpaa	dont take the risk. please. <br>  ive been thru it before.<br>  take it out when your with fam

Definitely go inside stores and look for them, there are plenty of prom designers out there who may also have a close design, but they would be in the $200-$300 range [yet the fabric would also most likely be better as well as the fit, but you could always have the dress altered].|`|KZtMModeaa	here you go! <br>  these are really cute!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cache.com/cache/control/product/~category_id=0100/~product_id=05044B22008492" rel="nofollow">http://www.cache.com/cache/control/produ...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cache.com/cache/control/product/~category_id=0100/~product_id=05044C35550056" rel="nofollow">http://www.cache.com/cache/control/produ...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cache.com/cache/control/product/~category_id=0100/~product_id=05041A70230350" rel="nofollow">http://www.cache.com/cache/control/produ...</a>

They can usually come up with amazing designs as long as you give them some things to incorporate and a little artistic freedom! Not to mention it will be a one-of-a-kind piece.<br>  <br>  And I don't want to be the one to preach "you'll regret it when you're older" but I would also suggest that you be SMART about placement. Even in this day and age tattoos are not considered "professional" so I have tried to put them in places hidden by most clothes yet they aren't so private that I can't show them off :)<br>  <br>  Just think it over, do some research, and it wouldn't hurt to go talk to a professional artist

Just the removable ones.  You can cut out mini-patterns from the temporary tattoos that will fit on your nails. Once you've cut out your designs, paint your nails with a clear or opaque polish. Let them dry for about 10 minutes before applying the tattoos. Follow the instructions that come with the tattoos for application. Typically you remove the clear protective sheet, press the colored part of the paper to your nails, wet with a paper towel for 30 seconds, and then carefully remove the paper backing.<br>  <br>  Once you've removed the paper backing, let nails air dry for a few minutes and then paint over the entire nail with clear nail polish. Let dry a full 15 minutes before starting the opposite hand or doing anything else.<br>  <br>  It looks pretty sweet :]|`|R8VhFeEVaa	How about other animal patterns to go along with the tiger print?

sMABbl71aa	I like the cut and i think it will look fine on you. If you're a heart shape make sure you add fullness and volume near your jawline though. As for the colour, blue is okay i think a very vibrate teal would look better! good luck!|`|dt2Vl76Gaa	dark hair would still look good with it. personally I'm not a big fan of scene hairstyles, but to each his own I guess. :P but anyways, dark brown would look a lot better than the bleached blond in the picture, and not as damaging as well. the only thing about the colors though it that with dark hair they will have to bleach the streaks in order to see the color. the downside to the colored streaks is that they fade rather quickly than any other hair color, and you have to maintain them, which is a real pain. I recommend going to hot topic or sally beauty and getting some clip-in colored streaks, which you can cut to your hair length. and you don't need to do any upkeep, they are relatively inexpensive and they blend in easily.|`|8vIh7iewaa	Yeahh just get that haircut like that..<br>  dont add in color though so you don't look so wierd ...|`|yESGH991aa	yea it'll look awesome (: usually scene people will go for blonde hair likek tht but this hairstyle will make u look differnet in a cool way.|`|blOfX1nhaa	Ive seen this photo before, did you save this from yahoo answers?

I'm only saying this because something like blue/pink/purple would require you to bleach parts of your hair, which result in breakage if you straighten your hair alot - especially round the front area.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i135.photobucket.com/albums/q138/xvballbabe874x/hairstyles/6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i135.photobucket.com/albums/q138/...</a><br>  <br>  That picture isn't too nice, but more of a rich chocolate colour....<br>  <br>  :) Hopefully that helped

3L9bRmOqaa	All of those bags are beautiful, but I am leaning towards bag #3.  Why? It is a classic shape bag.  You can take this bag to school and then off to work/volunteering/weekend shopping.

It will go great with a suit or professional attire.|`|AA10889282	I like one best and four second best.

I always see things as like, if I buy a bag for $350, and use it for the weekdays, everyday, you get like, a way better moneys' worth for it. <br>  <br>  But, if you really do not want to spend a lot of money on it, go right ahead and buy whichever one you want the best.  :)|`|h1dpGoEJaa	the fourth one is the cutest. it looks versatile so you can bring it to classes but then use it later at night for going out|`|ZGTGf6AIaa	The 3rd one.<br>  It'd go with more outfits and it's for any age.<br>  It's amazing..my mom has the same exact one.|`|1cac2b5f696d0a22ab31100c921b2a8baa	The 3rd one.|`|jTmMzolAaa	Yeah!

kT72QtHPaa	Concealer is basically just a SSUPER heavy duty foundation that you use to cover up your blemishes,under eye circles and red marks.<br>  <br>  Foundation is just a basic cover up,and you use it over your face,becuase if you used concealer all over your face it'd be too thick and probably make you break out.<br>  <br>  A good concealer for redness is one thats green(yes green).<br>  <br>  Dont rub on your concealer, pat it on then blend it lightly.<br>  A good concealer for undereyes and going over the green is NYX Concealer in a jar(they also have green concealer)<br>  <br>  Concealer should go on after your foundation, but the green stuff can go on underneath it,then after you have the foundation over the green concealer, put on the normal concealer.<br>  =)|`|hAkeSmleaa	Lancome has THE best foundations. Take my word for it. whenever i wear it people are like wow your skin is nice.. it really just evens out your face and covers up any blemishes (big or small)<br>  It doesnt create any zits either. seriously it makes your face look like butter. and it lasts long!

(just lke covergirl is good enough)<br>  It hids acne and it works.|`|C6vvNeyDaa	Theres really no way to completely cover those scars. Laser resurfacing is one of the only things I know of that will completely remove them. The procedure removes the top layer of skin but it's very expensive. I have a few scars on my chin and I've had good results using the Bare Minerals "bisque" concealer. My scars arent very big but the "bisque" really minimizes their appearance.|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	You either need a FULL coverage foundation-which tends to be heavy and cakey, or a good concealer. The concealer is MADE to work on smaller areas-the more pigmentation-the better the coverage. If you're trying to cover up discoloration/dark scars/under eyes use a concealer. Always set it with a powder translucent or not-doesn't matter. Mac is a little pricey but the studio finish spf 35 has had some GREAT reviews. And since they're scars go with a thick to stick concealer like the mac or a stick. Liquidy stuff just won't cut it. good luck! :)|`|UA6mt9ESaa	iv never done it but iv herd that you can but tooth paste on the marks n it will go away ya i no weird :)

71204fadefeb0aef75f4761be2bfbc09aa	Hey!<br>  Ok so I'm a guy but I have some suggestions because I did a study on height and I know a lot about what suits a shorter person.<br>  Dark colours will flatter your slim figure. Avoid big poofy dresses because they will make you look short and wide. Go for something with a v shaped neckline not round, because round makes your shoulders look wide and your chest flatter.<br>  With length either go for something long (especially if it's formal) or short (just below the knee) because they will both make you look taller. Mid length dresses are bad- make your legs look short.<br>  I have loads of other tips on clothes that make short people look taller, and also on practical stuff which might help you. If you want to talk more just contact me through my profile.<br>  Simon<br>  ;-)|`|UgfvDg2Baa	Try pink gown or whatever the color you like. it will surprise everyone. :)|`|x0gquSCsaa	im looking for a dress too!  i think you should look at delia's and nordstorm... i forget the other places

So playing one up might do wonders for you.<br>  <br>  Getting a shorter cut (long thin hair=not good), or trying out some layers with angling around your face might be a good idea.<br>  <br>  If you just want basics, try pulling it into two side braids, or a messy bun. <br>  <br>  But of course, I agree with the others on here, and say you should definitely talk to your hairstylist as well.|`|738UJGSfaa	this is a super super chic hairstly and i have seen it everywhere these days. Take it to a hair dresser and im sure they can do it for you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.grimmemennesker.dk/data/media/2/ugly-haircut.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.grimmemennesker.dk/data/media...</a>|`|UR3LtUvTaa	layers angles and highlights a little trim? straighten it half up half down (: that's me I have the same length and color my hair is straight other than the ends though hope it helps(:|`|fSn4KSuPaa	you would look great with hair like this-<br>  <a href="http://www.myhairstylingtools.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/bob-2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.myhairstylingtools.com/blog/w...</a><br>  also shorter hair tends to be a bit poofier and easier to fluff up and a LOT easier to handle especially in hot weather. <br>  by the way youre pretty! i think you have the kind of face to be a model.<br>  <br>  :D|`|vAhpjdNJaa	i'm sorry to be no help, but honestly i don't think you'll get answer on here.<br>  in my opinion you should see a professional hairstylist. it's like on the show What Not to Wear how their hair person always finds haircuts that suit the individuals based on features, skin tone, eye color, etc. <br>  the person who knows best is the person who can see you better, and also the person who is a professional. you'll be a lot happier with the results too.
d98055ea303df75aab59dc19d12d2be6aa	your very pretty! But maybe a different hairstyle|`|QfYGhtVwaa	You have a very unusual look, I reckon some modelling agency would be interested, quirky is the word I would use.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	I think you are perfectly fine the way you are. You're rocking your own style, And not many people are doing that these days.<br>  <br>  And I LOVE the Purple in your hair.|`|MV1l9yGIaa	The pic makes you look very white, I don't know if that is the real you but, if it is BLUSH is the answer.

Qa3yKIoDaa	I love the dove moisturizing one!<br>  it keeps my skin so soft and smells good.|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	Well i have used the olay one with the pink ribbons-the creme ribbons AND the dove go fresh. the olay is more moisturizing and i like evrything about it more-its so silky and well creamy! it's so moisturizing and smels awesome. the blue exfoliates to reveal softer skin the pink one makes your skin softer-im gonna go buy a tube soon-im almost out! the dove one is clear-the thick ones are always more hydrating than the clear ones good luck-go olay!|`|r4xRkqzdaa	i love the dove in the green bottle!  it's great and keeps my skin so soft and it has a light fresh scent.  i have almost everything in that line!<br>  <br>  i don't think there's a huge difference between that and the olay, so i would give it a shot instead of returning it... who knows you may find something new you like!  if not, it's only a few bucks....|`|yESGH991aa	I would go with olay becuase there aren't any harsh chemicals in it and it's great for skin types. Whether you have sensitivie skin or not.|`|lPCjNkEnaa	Dove is amazing!!!|`|MjPvMY8Baa	dove has a new green tea body wash which works miracles and it is cheap. You can get two large bottles and a travel size for less than $12 or get the bars. I recommend dove because it is best. Olay quench is great if you want just a lotion not a body wash. They have a great eye cream though|`|ZOHBGHMiaa	compare the two use one for a week and see if your skin gets better or worse and then do the other one and see which one works but i like dove but that's just my opinion|`|hQA8Ql21aa	I love everything of doves!|`|MV1l9yGIaa	Dove is great but, olay will work wonders for your skin. Dove is really not 1/3 cream!! Sorry.|`|f6rHiAe2aa	I love Dove....I buy everything Dove.....the best there is!|`|vaHVCSgtaa	Olay. it protects you from the sun and it gets rid of wrinkles. i watched this thing on it. :)|`|JhJXKRkOaa	I use dove shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, oh and I have some dove hand cream. the dove selection is good. oil of olay is also good. try the dove go fresh body wash, you may be surprised. if you don't like it or does'nt work then go back to oil of olay. both brands are good. think dove is softer on skin.

f4OB1XIHaa	Have you ever tried Pantene or Biolage? You can purchase them at any stores. For my hair, I use a hair product called "Kera Care." My hairdresser at JC Penney's has been using this product in my hair now for almost 4 years. I purchase this product @ 'Penneys - (because that's where I can only find it). Plus, Kera Care isn't expensive. I know what you mean, you want a hair product that's not expensive. The expense is under $30.00. I love it, though 'cause it's worth it to me. Now, my hair is healthy and strong with minimum buildup. I can send u a pic of my hair if you want me to.

Then the hair is washed.<br>  The process is repeated daily until the dandruff disappears, usually within a few days. <br>  -------------------------------<br>  Aspirin for Dandruff<br>  <br>  No problem, dissolve 2 aspirins in your dandruff shampoo and watch how it clears up. Use a good moisturizing conditioner afterward. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Hair Cocktail<br>  <br>  Splash a little vodka in your shampoo if you have thick or product-build-up hair. Don't use on a regular basis. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  BUILD-UP REMOVER<br>  <br>  Often the culprits of drab coloring and lackluster hair are all the styling products that we regularly use. They begin to build up and dull the shine and tone of our hair.<br>  <br>  Get rid of the build up by mixing 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar with 1 gallon of distilled water. This can be stored in a cabinet or the refrigerator and used every couple of weeks to keep hair squeaky clean. To use it, wet hair with warm water, or shampoo and rinse as usual. Then pour 2 cups over the scalp and let mixture saturate the hair. Finish up with a cold-water rinse.|`|AA11626669	For the buildup, your best bet would be Neutrogena Clean Shampoo-you can get a bottle for around $4 at most drugstores.<br>  <br>  For your dandruff however, it would be best to use a dandruff shampoo, either Head and Shoulders, or Selsun Blue.  I recommend Selsun Blue, as it's worked for me in the past.|`|tehdmkjkaa	Use Axe Scrub tu get rid of the buildup and then follow up with a varying conditioner.

Next you need to take top sections of your hair one - two inches wide spray the underneath of it with hairspray and then on the top. move the comb toward your roots quickly. this will tangle your hair some but make it stand up and look awesome. Keep doing this around the rest of your head. It is optional to tease your bangs.

pjJD4yYPaa	I think your a pretty girl, and despite all the other answers; i think you have potential.<br>  First you need to figure out what kinda of modeling you'd like to do. High fashion, Commercial, etc<br>  <br>  Then your gonna need training in whichever field you choose.<br>  So, say for example your not sure how to pose, take direction, or your just really bad at it you'll be taught.<br>  <br>  An as far as asking everyone else what they think. It doesn't matter what they think. It matters how you think and feel about yourself, because that industry is extremely cut throat.

l1YYtAPjaa	yes i have used bleach blonde before on my black hair. but if you use it, it'll make your hair look like an orange/yellow color!  i only used it so my hair color can get light and then i would color my hair the color i desired.. like brown,very bonde, or red!!! the only bad thing is that it will itch your hair and make it feel like it's on fire. also it will make your hair really thin so if you do use it don't leave it on too long. You have to keep checking on it to see if it's light enough..|`|63binSI0aa	Nope. But you should really go to a professional to get your hair lightened. If you choose the wrong developer your hair could turn orange or break off entirely.|`|KREQ9sqGaa	no but if thats you in the picture on your profile i wouldn't touch a thing! deffinatly dont go blonde|`|t2dc0JHtaa	omg please don't use it on black hair!! your hair wil go orange !! leave yr hair alone looking at yr profile picture u have nice hair!! and defiantly go to a hairdressers, don't do anything yr self it wil damage your hair!! i no this because im a hairdresser i hope this helps xox
63binSI0aa	Yep. Just make sure that you use a heat protecting spray.|`|xv3opX9Maa	yahh <br>  ( =|`|RiStkJT9aa	yes all the perm does is just make it perminently straight/curly or waterver you want but you cna still straighten or curl it|`|yMDKvKvFaa	yes, it would just take a little more work. it's no different than if you had naturally curly hair and you wanted to straighten it. you'll probably need to use a hair dryer and a straightening iron after. and be careful of damaging your hair, since it would be chemically treated.
JjsuyPsuaa	Pros- its cute, heals nicely, you can hide it.<br>  <br>  Cons-if you gain weight it isn't so cute anymore.<br>  <br>  I am 23 and have had mine since i was 16. I love it and its been my favorite peircing so far.|`|m0FO6Zglaa	Well 1st off, its the cutest piercing for a bikini! The only thing yu should worry about is makin sure its clean. Like when yu shower, use anti bacterial soap-dial- and use a shot glass with sea salt and water 2 sit on top of your belly ring to clean and ease the pain. It doesn't hurt at all, no after pains like a tongue piercing. Also, dnt play with it, it will take longer to heal. Only touch it while you're in the shower, moving it up and dwn with the anti bacterial soap. I hope I helped! Good luck hun!|`|AA11053088	Pros: It's cute<br>           It's fun<br>           It's sexy<br>           Plus it attractive!<br>  <br>  Cons: Infection<br>            Getting fat<br>            Having a baby<br>            Not looking good on you!<br>  <br>  Get it, only if you're a cute skinny-mini! Otherwise, save everyone the repulsive sight!|`|WelEvYwGaa	Um...just don't ever do any sports with the ring in. D:<br>  <br>  my mom surfed with it in, it got all infected after all the chafing.<br>  <br>  then there was a girl in pe playing softball who decided to slide for a base and ripped it out. bleeding of course<br>  <br>  so  yeah just make sure to take it out when doing any kinds of sports.|`|K8Za4s0Daa	If you want one, get one.<br>  But be sure to keep it clean, infected piercings suck a** lol.<br>  I can't think of any cons though.<br>  It's not like a belly ring is life altering haha.

nSSCWkBlaa	the problem is that your hair has not been prelightened enough. it needs to be bleached ( lightened ) out to a very pale yellow and then toned with a nice icy cool toner ,,,,,,,,,,always best to have it done by a Pro to avoid damage and get the prettiest Blonde .Applying a color over top of what you have spells disaster!!! grey , green , muddy color !|`|f6fCixDnaa	Go to a hairdresser! The number of girls who run around trying to get blonde all by themselves from a dark colour is ridiculous. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately all you are doing is further damaging your hair. If you want it plantinum go to a hairdresser. Stop trying to dye it yourself when you dont know what you are doing, other than damaging it beyond repair.<br>  <br>  If you do it yourself u have to go in stages..which is damging it over and over and over until its right...or you just could go to a hairdresser and damage it once rather than 100 times trying to get it right. Bleach isnt something non-professionals should play with.|`|0qGBq4Nxaa	you have to lighten it in stages... or get it prof. done. going dark to really light is a tricky process....
WcsYK6sYaa	my hair is just like that. i have i shortish cut around my shoulders with side bangs and lots of layering. also i strainin it. so i would do something like this. and i would get highlights or lowlights|`|ZaHTfox3aa	AH! I used to have the SAME problem!<br>  <br>  Solution 1: Foam Curlers---buy a whole pack of diff sizes and put the in your hair<br>  <br>  Solution 2: Mousse/gel---Put some on it<br>  <br>  That's really all you can do...|`|wkzQm47Naa	well i think you should use this curl cream called 'kenra'. it's not expensive and is easy to manage. it doesn't tangle either. another thing to use is the kids detangler that you can get next to the shampoo and conditioner section. put the kenra cream in you and mix between both hands and just scrunch with your fingers and afterwards use hairspray|`|hsfhqbztaa	in the shower use deep conditioner. <br>  I recomend the ones from a dye box.<br>  works the best.

mf9bjIhoaa	THIS MIGHT BE A LOT TO READ BUT IT'S WORTH IT :D<br>  <br>  Always rinse with cold water after using a shampoo and conditioner for straight hair.<br>  <br>  Use any natural home made hair mask. one egg to one part mayo and one part olive oil. Make a paste and apply to hair. Wrap hair in a towel and allow to work at least 30 minutes. Rinse out and shampoo and condition as usual. Hair will have a smooth, shiny appearance.<br>  <br>  Blow dry methodically. This can take practice and time, but it is worth it. Use a big round brush that will allow you to smooth your hair as you dry. Always blow in a downward motion. Running the dryer over hair up and down causes the cuticle to frizz and split. Divide hair into sections with curler pins and dry one section at a time.<br>  <br>  Air dry your hair instead of using a blow dryer or hair dryer (the kind with bonnets attached to a hose). This will also cut down on split ends. Using a curling iron or hot rollers is acceptable, but this can also damage your hair if not done properly.<br>  <br>  Frizzy hair almost always needs extra moisturizing. When choosing a shampoo or conditioner, look for the words smoothing, moisturizing or hydrating. These products will contain emollients to smooth the hair shaft and offer more control during styling.<br>  <br>  After the hair is towel dried you will want to apply one or more of the many smoothing agents to be found in stores.<br>  <br>  Smoothing serums and frizz serums aid in smoothing the hair but usually do not offer the holding quality of other products. Some of these are light in weight and can be used alone on hair that gets frizzy but becomes overly limp with more product. Others are heavy in nature and aid in controlling hair with too much body. The heavier product should be used sparingly until you have experience in its effect on your type of hair. Serums are most often applied to wet hair.<br>  <br>  Hair crèmes are creamy in form and usually add control to the hair along with the frizz relief properties. They can be used on wet hair or worked into dry hair and provide a certain amount of hold.<br>  <br>  Gels offer the maximum in hold and are usually better at relieving frizz than a mousse. The layering of several of these products will increase the amount of frizz control.<br>  <br>  Reading labels, advice from your hairdresser and experimenting will help you decide which products will work best for you.<br>  <br>  and try this websites it has GREAT hairstyles :D<br>  <br>  <a href="http://homebeautytips.blogspot.com/2008/01/hairstyle-topics.html" rel="nofollow">http://homebeautytips.blogspot.com/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED :D
C0HZ8ZB4aa	Okay, you could be talking about 1cm diameter stars, or 3inch diameter stars. You could be talking about hollow stars, filled stars, detailed stars. Also, prices vary all over the world, and even within one town in the world, they vary from studio to studio enormously. Nobody can give you an accurate answer on this. The most accurate, based on the information you've given, I could get is an estimation somewhere between ￡20 and ￡150 in British money. So why don't you pop into the tattoo studio you've chosen and ask? If you're lucky, they might even be able to do it there and then for you, so you won't have had a wasted journey.|`|ZAJqUKDvaa	It's definitely going to depend on the size.

r4xRkqzdaa	you absolutely cannot compare covergirl to MAC.... i would never use that drug store stuff again after using the quality brands<br>  <br>  however, if you asked me to tell the difference between a MAC shadow for $15 bucks vesus a Chanel shadow for a lot more, i couldn't tell you about a difference.  <br>  <br>  eyeliner is the worst thing to cheap out on- never get that at the drugstore!  you just gotta find out what products work for you!<br>  <br>  plus, it's also important that my cosmetics are not tested on animals and do not contain any harmful materials. high-level cosmetics live up to that standard|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Yep, it really does. You can find some OK cheap stuff, but until you try the expensive stuff, you don't really know what you are missing.|`|Qa3yKIoDaa	some don't, some do.<br>  it depends on what brand.|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	yes-for the most part. mac's fluid eyeliner is great but it's liquidy-if you're talking pencils-i hear it comes off/smudges within a couple hours. people say revlon colorstay and almay is even better. but i've heard the BEST eyeliner is from mary kay. on a general basis-you get what you pay for but not always. if you're just starting i wouldn't suggest buying ALL expensive stuff-although splurging on foundation isn't a bad idea.. you're still learning and you dont want to waste your money by wasting product.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	yes and no. I think it depends on what it is. I dont think eyeliner makes much difference. BUt foundation I feel does make a difference. I have been using a better brand now and can see a difference in my face.|`|gdGDvWTDaa	idk<br>  i;ve never had the luxury of using nice makeup lol|`|yWoK9ryJaa	Yes it makes a huge difference in fact watch this youtube video it made her look radiant more so than after watching her tutorials of other products you can see such a huge difference.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12ycA&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vt5Ur12y...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  These products are worth the investment!|`|rENVXGd3aa	yeah, i think some makes a difference.<br>  others, not so much .<br>  i use urban decay black oil slick eyeshadow, and i use maybelene eyelyner.<br>  it stays all day : D|`|AXEqOEloaa	I used to wear MAC makeup but since I became a SAHM I started using the Revlon colorstay. I will say that there was no difference other then the price.|`|PJec1EfGaa	MAC is non-allergenic<br>  & the difference is it's just plain-out better quality. <br>  like would you rather wear dollarstore make up?|`|6RrmmDyLaa	It is a matter of testing yourself, some expensive makeup (especially cover up) works better than the cheaper ones.|`|ZOHBGHMiaa	it probably stays on longer but you should like compare them together put the cheap on and then count how many days its on until it wares off then do the other....|`|iqPDfdVGaa	Don't use makeup at all, its a waste of money. Personally i think my girlfriend looks fine with or without it.|`|kT72QtHPaa	It really depends.<br>  <br>  Alot of people are makeup snobs and tihnk only high end brands will work the best,but NOT true!<br>  <br>  There are many duplicates!<br>  <br>  I mean, I luv her videos and all, but fafinettex3 is an example.<br>  She used to use alot of drugstore things but now shes all about MAC,Stila,Bobbi Brown and NARS. I mean alot of the things she buys now look identical to her drugstore eyeshadows and liners,shes fooling herself! She says its pretty and it looks identical to her previous ones.<br>  <br>  And if you look at the ingredients and how they make their makeup,trust me there is hardly a difference(like the person said up there,dollar store makeup) it can be just as good,but if you're a makeup SNOB then you'll convince yourself its better.<br>  It's called cheating people,thats what makeup brands do! Like MAC for instance, they charge too much but people will buy it anyways because they think its better and higher quality.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it is,for instance-MAC Studio Fix, its good stuff but makes some people breakout. But its good,but Revlon Colorstay is almost the same,and doesnt make you breakout.<br>  <br>  Try eyeslipsface.com(also their Studio Line)<br>  <br>  :)|`|ALNZ9Eftaa	It really depends on the brand and what it's specifically for.  For instance, MAC Eyeliner (for me) always smears towards the end of the day.  As opposed to CHANEL eyeliner - it stays on all day even 'til the next day (after partying all night).  But, MAC lipsticks are great!  The color lasts longer on your lips and  Chanel doesn't.  Lancome mascaras are okay but Maybelline Intense XXL (Volume & Length) does wonders to my short eyelashes.  I've used cheaper products back in the days such as Revlon, Almay and Loreal and it's actually as good as the higher end brand names!|`|n0RqU3lmaa	Yes some actually do really it is the texture that makes a difference , more high quality make up goes on more smoothly and often times last longer .|`|fi8MksbZaa	yes, in sum ways..... like make up Base is really important so it will always be a good and expensive one bt other things you can choose
vaHVCSgtaa	omg i have the same problem and BENZA CLIN saved my life.<br>  at first my doctor prescribed it to us and we picked it up. google it or something. im not kidding you. GET THIS! it costs about 30 bucks but you get alot and it should last you a very long time because when you use it all you need is a little. i seriously saw a difference in like a day. overnight actually.<br>  <br>  lol.|`|mgeuli7Naa	Go to a dermatologist and ask if Differin would be good for you. Make sure they give you the cream kind and not the more drying kind. It worked for me!|`|blOfX1nhaa	try Aubry Organics for sensative skin cream cleanser or MyChelle for sensative skin or Weleda the almond range.|`|goA1h6Cpaa	you need to see a dermo. <br>  its the only way<br>  pharmacy stuff wont work if ur acne is horrible

h6wiioEqaa	in the instructions it tells you that it should be wet.<br>  I am naturally a brunette but i've found that dyeing my hair light brown then after a few days i wash my hair with shampoo then put the sun-in through it, blow dry it and see the results, then i put hair colour conditioner in it wait 2mins and then wash out the conditioner that my hair goes lighter and that its not as dry as it would be if i didn't leave the condition in it.<br>  If its not light enough i suggest waiting 2 to 3 days then doing the process again. Remember should only be used twice a week!|`|B1PdBo78aa	No but, don't get out of the shower and then use it and dry your hair.<br>  your hair WILL FALL out.<br>  <br>  It happened to me.

Start with a small flick and build it up from there until it looks the way you want. It's a lot easier to add a little more then to have to remove it and start over. I love doing cat eyes :)|`|btPPw1FHaa	Liquid eyeliner! Wing it out on your outer corner and also line your botton lid with it, then bring in it to the inner corner. So basically you inner and outter corners will be point and that will make your eyes look almondish and cat like.|`|sPDQIxJTaa	youtube or google it.|`|G4e9N4Tdaa	you apply your eyeliner like normal, but except on the top lid, when you get to the end on the outside, you draw the line a little longer and make a small swoop.<br>  try these youtube videos if you dont really underdstand my explination. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TsppdPzXro" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TsppdPzX...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcTiEHWwN58&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcTiEHWwN...</a><br>  <br>  hope i helped! =]
0xgVNOsaaa	im pretty sure thats a dark dirty blonde...with a couple different shades of blonde or brown in there.<br>  *the best way to get that hair color is to take that picture in, probably the first once cuz it does better at showing the colors, and they can probably help yu match the colors, if not exactly it would be pretty close.<br>  *the main thing in her hair is just that it has  a couple different color highlights so ask for that obviously lol<br>  <br>  good luck! hope yu like it afterwords!|`|Pp3Bx2B9aa	Her hair is a warm medium brown with lighter blonde highlights. To get it that color you would buy a meduim brown base and a blonde high-lighting kit or you could pay and go to the salon.|`|NIsJma0zaa	med brown with highlights (and maybe low lights i cant tell) and dirty blonde streeks <br>  its a pretty look for long hair short hair its not so pretty|`|avlVHXDCaa	the first one the other one is not the cool|`|RvVvaVsAaa	its dark brown with natural highlights, and highlights that frame the face.
63binSI0aa	Since your hair is mid length it will look about chin length after the tight perm. And yes you'll need to use a heat protection spray to flat iron your hair - try Heat Seal from Paul Mitchell - and it will take your hours to straighten it so be prepared chica. :-) To get your hair to look like that you'll need to get it permed at a hair salon. Also, make sure you tell them when you colored last, if you have ever had hi lights - your whole hair history with no exceptions. If you leave anything out they could choose the wrong type of perm solution and your hair could fall out so be careful.|`|hSJoFltpaa	your picture isn't clicky.

7PUmsocmaa	You really should not try to get a real "sun" tan, sure you will look hot now but what about in 5, 10 or even 20 years?? Try fake tanning again. Get a professional spray and ask for the lightest colour! Im not sure which brands they have in your country but in Australia I love St Tropez, Naked Tan, Black Magic, Skinwear and Vani-t Liquid Sun. I have heard great things about Fantasy Tan - try their lightest colour and work up to a darker colour from there!<br>  <br>  There are two main reasons you will turn orange, first because you use a colour that is two dark for your skin or second because your technician applies too much product - you should not be dripping!! Your better with two very light coats rather than one thick coat!|`|5Wd6sIqbaa	I don't know why someone would tell you to stop natural tanning, maybe spread it out more, 15mins Mon, 15mins Wed, and 15mins Sat or something.|`|dUwl7Gn0aa	you can buy tablets that will give you a tan, i didnt beleive it as well until someone told me at work...heres a link to some<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deeptantablets.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.deeptantablets.com/index.htm</a>

vAhpjdNJaa	it depends on your hair type. length doesn't necessarily determine how your hair will curl or not. its how the individual hairs are shaped themselves, at the tips. what it comes down to is genetics. <br>  and i don't know how young you are, but if you are in your early teen years that could also be why. your hair could be starting to change like some people's hair changes color or whatever at a certain age.|`|edzU8VJiaa	No, however long it gets, it will still be wavy, though if it is very thick and heavy, the weight may reduce the waves slightly.  If it's more wavy than it was, it's just because you have never seen the full effect because it was cut short.  You can always use straighteners on it if you don't like your waves - or go the other way, and have it beautifully layered, so the waves are part of the style (good if your hair is not really thick).<br>  <br>  I had long hair in the '60's, when the fashion was for very long, very straight hair, but mine was wavy.  We used to iron it to make it straight  (no hair-straighteners, in those days -how I wish we'd had those then). <br>  <br>   I used to go out wearing perfume, which still failed to cover the smell of scorched hair, and also, on some occasions, I still had the pain of the burnt ears where I'd got the iron a bit too close....<br>  <br>  In the '70's, my long wavy hair became fashionable (although by that time I had 2 children and had long given up ironing it; I had enough to do without ironing my hair as well!)|`|8vIh7iewaa	well it depends if you have curly or straight hair ..<br>  if it's straight then then it wont turn curly<br>  if its curly it might get like wavy if your like used to straightning it all the time..|`|5cAIFYiOaa	Hair often gets less manageable as it gets longer, the good news is that it's easier to straighten when it's longer. You should be able to flatten that right out with a flat iron.|`|MKWrLkH8aa	My hair is bouncy when it's short, wavy at mid length and curly when it's long. No fricking idea why - surely it should be the other way around?
Ip3KoXYfaa	Acne is caused by dirty, oil face, and most importantly hormones. The best way to clear acne, is basically wait out puberty. During the years of puberty 13-20 (not 17) the chance of you getting acne is much higher. The best way to control an oily skin is by washing your face with cleanser twice a day when you wake up and before you sleep. Don't over dry your face because that's how you get more oil! <br>  <br>  Another tip is not to use poor-commercial facial cleansers that you can buy from local drug stores. Use brands like Clarins or BBio-thermPersonal Favorite) or CClinique They have excellent products for both men and women-- it may a bit pricey. <br>  <br>  Every other day, I would recommend to use scrubs to scrub your face. A good one is Apricot Scubs from Burts Bee. Scubs help clear out dirt and blackheads. After cleaning you face, it is best if you toners to further wipe out the dirts / oil under your skin.<br>  <br>  Best way to control acne is to use some sort of acne prevention creme-- Bio-therm has a complete section from their T-pur section. Again it may be pricey but the stuff is amazing. <br>  <br>  Lastly and most importantly, I believe the best remedy for acne is to control you diet and sleeping pattern. Dont sleep too late, and get lots of rest. Also stay away from fast food or foods that are deep fried. Those are really bad for you! <br>  <br>  Eat healthy. sleep regularly, and wash you face twice a day. You will survive your acne era, no problem. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|6TdlNfgeaa	Pro-active usually works if you use it A LOT.  At least 2 times a day.. well, that's what works for me.|`|m9vr74gyaa	if pro active didnt work, try tooth paste. I kno it sounds stupid, but it really works.<br>  cover your face in tooth paste, or where the acne is, leave it on for a couple minutes, or till it starts to like "burn" (it doesnt hurt or anything,just the only word i could think of to describe the feeling) then  get it off using warm water.|`|SA6dCr0Laa	I had the same problem. I had acne but it wasnt bad enough for medication. I tried lots of expensive products, but i found that neutrogena worked best. I use the daily black head eliminator cleanser, its gentle to use every day. I also use the oil free moisterizer with spf 15 (very important to use spf everyday) Even if you decide not to use  this brand, maybe the products you are using are  not oil free. So try oil free stuff and make sure u moisturize day and nite..Also try to drink lots of water.<br>  Hope this works.|`|lBjgfpf7aa	birth control pills-- I hardly ever get zits anymore.

xqljgDHmaa	The hot water will shrink the cotton threads in the jeans if the jeans are 95% or more cotton. It will hold them in tight for a bit, but eventually the threads will relax again. <br>  <br>  To shrink them as much as possible, wash them in the hottest setting, then dry them in the hottest setting for as long as possible.<br>  <br>  If they still don't fit, go to a tailor. He/She can make your jeans look like $400 jeans, even if they only cost $20!|`|0AQF8pnKaa	It should work. I would soak them in the hottest water, then throw them in the hottest dryer cycle. Also, another technique i use is after i throw them in the dryer, i stop it half way (when the jeans are half-way dry), then if it's around the thigh area or wherever you want it to get smaller, i would spray it with a little extra water there. Then finish the drying cycle. You might have to do this several times to get the desired tightness. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|AA11387133	Normally, any shrinkage from a hot wash/dry will stretch out again withm normal wearing.

YldKg4vBaa	I actually just got hired at Subway last night, and have the big packet full of process and procedures there.<br>  <br>  Quoted straight out of the packet - <br>  <br>  C. JEWELRY<br>   - No facial jewelry except on ears. Stud earrings only.<br>   - No rings with exception of wedding ring<br>   - Watches are allowed.<br>  <br>  As for wage, it depends on your state and minimum wage, and the subway, I'm starting out at 7.25$ / hour|`|JCK4sKfPaa	Depends on what one you work at. At the one near my house there was a      who wore a sweatshirt with a hand flipping someone off on the back! Plus all the facial piercings! So ya, it doesn't really matter.|`|nXFbY4vEaa	No, I don't think so, I saw a guy working there the other day that had a facial piercing|`|ZaC5udNBaa	Technically, no, you do not have to take out facial piercings.  They do, however have to be covered up.  <br>  <br>  I worked as a waitress for three years, and even nose rings had to be covered up with band-aids.  <br>  <br>  The good thing about most chain restaurants like Subway is that most managers don't take that rule seriously.  So you may be able to get away with keeping your piercing in. <br>  <br>  Minimum wage depends on what state you live in.  It can range anywhere from $6.15 - $8.15.  I know in PA, where I live, minimum wage is $7.15 and going up to $7.25 this summer.<br>  <br>  Use this map to find out how much it is in your state:  <a href="http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/america.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dol.gov/esa/minwage/america.h...</a>|`|BKUhGTHdaa	I've seen people working there with piercings, so I would guess no.

nQ6ZbsRAaa	Yeah, you do have to pay.<br>  <br>  Beware though.. if you use it daily then you'll be come immune to it.<br>  <br>  This happened to me.. and it no longer works on my skin.<br>  <br>  My dermatologist said to alternate, like one acne med one day and proactive the next.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RvEkN9Rsaa	Yes, once you order Proactiv it will automatically ship every 2 months with a $60 payment being made.  However when you do order it you can make an account on the Proactiv website.  This lets you customize when they ship your kit.  I have mine come every 3 months, which then means I only pay every 3 months.  Use the trial and test it out, if you like it make sure you customize your shipment schedule otherwise you will waste both money and product.|`|8QjEISWeaa	d|`|mRQ6D0Ipaa	Absolutely not true. Its just easier and cheaper to buy it on tv just in case you don't like it. But if you don't like it and you want to return it you can return it with the receipt and in the 60 day trial run. So just buy it on tv and all you have to pay it's $20 and some shipping!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped|`|3apkkyPJaa	that's definitely NOT true<br>  <br>  you really do have to pay $60 every 2 months.<br>  <br>  be careful with it. i used it a couple years ago, and while it worked for about 2 months, my skin eventually became immune to it and i was wasting money|`|a1KT2SQlaa	its not free, they charge you 59.99 or more every time they send it! and this kit will last you longer than that, way longer in fact. i suggest you cancel when you get it otherwise they will keep charging you and you will have so much proactive its unbelievable!|`|24sK6L2uaa	I've been using it for about a year and it works fine for me.

x4NcoGjmaa	i have gotten i perm before...big mistake i have wavy hair and i wanted more volume and thought it would turn out like that picture and the stylist said she had the biggest curlers and they turned out tight curls perms dont make curls that big and plus when you want to grow it out you will have curly hair at the bottom and then your staight hair showing and youll have a big dent in your hair and they dry your hair out so much so dont please scrunch your hair with gel but dont punish your self with a perm they are awful
mLD6hy8naa	Take a shower with it on. In hot water. It will mold to your head, like you do with a mouthguard to your teeth. Then leave it on your head while it dries a little. You can even blow dry it. You can take it off when it is only a little damp.|`|65380270fb2a73cb4f9cd0edb98218f2aa	Depends on the material.  If it's natural (cotton or wool) hot water and then drying hot will shrink it.  if it's synthetic.... buy a new hat.
7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	How powerful it is and the heat. The air should blow out strong, and it you want to use it on hot, it gives enough heat to dry the hair quickly. A blow dryer will not really make the hair shiny; that comes from the product you put on your hair before you dry it. Check out Epinions or Folica to read reviews.

This is caused due to a protective mechanism built-in to the body to help keep a person warm during periods of starvation and malnutrition, and the hormonal imbalances that result.<br>  <br>  I don't know what to tell you about getting rid of it, but that sounds like Lanugo, which is a side effect of Bulimia or Anorexia...

lxYWZc9caa	Well you should start out with pinchers, which pretty much look like regular earrings, and a small size. I recommend an 18 or 20. When you are old enough to decide for yourself, you can go to bigger sizes. A good size would be about a 2(its a modest size, a little bigger than your thumbnail). Anything bigger is pushing it, and once you get to a size 0 theres no turning back. Whatever you do though, DONT SKIP SIZES. It can make your ear puffy and red, and you might end up with a blowout (you need surgery to fix it)|`|5752f4a64681996c65d14ae0704b5215aa	You can easily get away with 10 gauge without anyone knowing.

190d0e2350e47a93ee950563d0fe8690aa	I actually just went prom dress shopping Saturday, well I had been Sweet Sixteen dress shopping since last February, but there are some good stores, it depends on your taste. I suggest before you do, check out designers you like and then go to locate stores. Some main chain stores definitely are: Macy's, Lord and Taylor, Cache, Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Saks, BCBG Max Azria, Nordstrom Rack, Loehmann's, Filene's Basement. Arundel Mills's Last Call and Off 5th have some great dresses as well. So check out the closest locations for the other stores if you want to go to any of those.<br>  <br>  For prom specialty stores, I've been going to ones more in the northern Baltimore County region so I don't know if my reviews will be of any help to you, I did go to this one in Rockville, it was great, but it got closed down recently. The ones I have gone to: <br>  1. Vasarri in Pikesville: Good dresses, but a littttle overpriced and it is geared towards I guess more of an older generation, so if you are generally a smaller size, it may be harder for you to get a dress, but they carry good designers. <br>  2. Deja Vu in Mt Airy: They have great prices but dresses range in style, some are good, some are a bit too...flamboyent? The sizes are also in a great range, so you can definitely find something in your size no matter what. They also have A LOT of dresses, one of the most of this list.<br>  3. Ransom's in Towson: They carry a good range of brands, but the sizes are a bit more difficult to get, sometimes they tend to be a bit bigger sized? There also aren't as many dresses and the dresses they have are a bit flamboyent, but I recently got my prom dress there, while it's not the perfect dress, I only have 2 months until my prom, so I had to make a quick decision and my mom and I ordered my prom dress. The price was a lot lower than what we saw from online and we will get it in 4 weeks instead of from 8 to 12. <br>  4. M'Jourdelle in Towson: I've been here only once, but they have a lot of dresses. Prices seem to be nice, but I couldn't say a lot since I didn't see many dress I liked, I guess? The dresses weren't that much different, one of the only negatives is trying to walk around, the stairs are very scary to go up.<br>  5. Pinky's Bridal in Randallstown: Eh, good prices, okay dresses. Can't say much, they have a middle amount of dresses and a good range of designers.<br>  6. Aram previously in Rockville: They still have a store somewhere in VA, it was very expensive, but the dresses were definitely stuff I couldn't find anywhere else since most stores buy dresses they can afford, they didn't have many dresses, which is how they probably had such dresses. Reallllly expensive, but it could still be in your budget, it's like Vasarri, but I actually preferred this since they had my size, prettier dresses, and better attitudes. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://dailyadress.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://dailyadress.blogspot.com</a> Check out the designers on the right side to see if you like any and locate other stores closer to your area. Good luck!|`|PxtmMAMnaa	department stores should have the best selection since they have such a variety. or try BCBG, hopefully they have one near you because their dresses are gorgeous!|`|OMYKHs2Iaa	Maybe you should go to a department store. They have many of them.
