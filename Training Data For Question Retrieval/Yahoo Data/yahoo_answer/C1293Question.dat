20080305104500AAFSdCF	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Calculating pressure of a woman's heel in Pascals?	I'm trying to calculate the pressure exerted by a 120 lb woman who's heels have an area of 3.8cm^2 (assuming all weight is put on the heels) in Pa.      What I did was I multiplied 120 by 4.47 to get Newtons (Force) which was equal to 536 N. I changed 3.8cm^2 to .038m^2 then divided to get 14105 Pa, then divided by 2 for each heel to get 7052.6 which had to be changed to 7100 because of significant figures... however this answer is wrong, did i skip a step or should I have put it into scientific notation??

20081003153133AAfp0zg	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Evolution, are we all inbreeds?	It is an obvious fact that inbreeding leads to birth defects.  But aren't we all inbred?  The first known (believed) was a woman named Lucy.  If that is correct then she is the original mother to everyone on Earth.  Of course now inbreeding is not that big of a problem because of the huge population.  But for Lucy's kids, I think it would be a pretty big problem.  So rational would say that all of Lucy's grandchildren were inbreeds, which would most likely lead to the birth defects.  The closeness is relation for several generations would be a problem.  Has this problem ever been researched?  Are we all deformed?

My friend keeps telling me that the blood people donate to many of those busses near wal-mart and colleges sell your blood to some hospitals and i just keep telling him that this might not be true. But today someone else told me that same thing and now I'm confused. Do they really sell the blood people donate? I think that would be messed up since they tell you prior to getting your blood that it will be used for cancer patients such as children and others, and they never tell you that it will be sold to those hospitals treating cancer patients such as those childs and others.... If this is not true and the blood collected from donors is not sold, can anyone give me a page or some place it might be explained thoroughly. I also understand there are this blood banks where they pay people so that they donate their blood, and then i think they make you sign a paper and then i supposed they do with your blood whatever they want since they paid for it; but other than that i don't know anything about donated blood sold to hospitals.

20090227172349AAhiJ0z	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Science research project help?	Ok.  So I have to do a research project for my southwest science class.    Here is what I was thinking of:  I put sugar water in my bird feeder.  I would put out 3 different hummingbird feeders with 3 different amounts of sugar, and see if the hummingbirds would prefer a certain amount of sugar. Every 2 days I would measure how much was gone from each feeder.          My problem is that I need 8 hrs of observation.  I was was thinking that for 8 of those days I would watch the feeder for 1 hour, at the same time, and record how many hummingbirds drink from the feeder.  But I don't know if that is scientific, because I wouldn't be watching the feeder all the time, just over 3 weekends.        My teacher said I couldn't do my 1st project, where I would be seeing how long it would take for each feeder to empty, because I wouldn't be seeing the exact time they emptied, and I didn't have  8 hrs of watching the birds.       So is it still ok if I am not watching the birds the whole time, but still measuring the amount?  And then I would have 2 sets of data, one for the amounts measured, and one for how many hummingbirds I observed?

Ok...We just started to study Newtons Laws in physics and I'm having a lot of trouble here...      If a ball is placed in the center of the wagon and the wagon is then pulled abruptly forward then describe the ball's motion in relation to ground...and relative to the wagon.      So I know that when the wagon is pulled forward the ball moves back so it doesn't move in relation to the ground but it does in the relation to the wagon. But what does inertia have to do with that? How can physics explain the ball moving backward, if it's moving how is that inertia?       Also, if you are twirling a ball clockwise on a string and the string snaps will it continue to move in a curved path or will it shoot off in straight line. I know that it will move in a straight line but I - once again don't understand why! I mean wouldn't inertia make it want to continue in a curved path?      Much help needed and very appreciated!

Radio direction finders are placed at points A and B, which are 3.46 miles apart on an east-west line, with A west of B. From A, the bearing of a certain radio transmitter is 47.7 degrees, while from B, the bearing is 303 degrees. Find the distance between A and the transmitter.      2. A person is flying a plane in a straight course and observes a mountain at a bearing of 24.1 degrees to the right of its course. At that time, the plane is 7.92 km from the mountain. a short time later, the bearing to the mountain becomes 32.7 degrees. How far is the airplane from the mountain when the second bearing is taken?      (I'm thinking Law of Sines?)      PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW YOU GOT THE ANSWER!   Any and all help welcome.   Thanks so much!

20090225105050AAGBPKl	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	How do space crafts avoid objects in space? ex. asteroid belt?	For space crafts that reach the outer solar system, how do they navigate through "crowded" areas like the asteroid or kupier belts?  I know there is a lot of "empty" space out there, but the asteroid belt for example contains thousands or millions of asteroids.  Do they plan a safe route through these regions in space or just cross their fingers and hope they pass through untouched? If not, do they have systems which can detect objects and alter their course to miss these objects?  I would think that moving out of the way of an asteroid would consume lots of thrust propellant and would require additional adjusting to get back on course, but honestly I am just speculating.

Although NASA have technology to detect asteroids etc and are able to predict how close to the earth it will pass, or if it will actually have impact with earth but, can NASA actually 'control' the path of N.E.O's or could we say that they are wild ?
20090225073049AA54VxL	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Some laser/ light questions?	What is the wavelength of microwaves of 3.0 x 109 Hz frequency?        0.050 m   0.060 m   0.10 m   0.20 m      The relationship between frequency, wavelength, and speed holds for light waves because        light travels slower in a vacuum than in air.   all forms of electromagnetic radiation travel at a single speed in a vacuum.   light travels in straight lines.   different forms of electromagnetic radiation travel at different speeds.      Which best describes the image of a concave mirror when the object is at a distance greater than twice the focal point distance from the mirror?        virtual, upright, and magnification greater than one   real, inverted, and magnification less than one   virtual, upright, and magnification less than one   real, inverted, and magnification greater than one      Which is not correct when describing the formation of rainbows?       A rainbow is really spherical in nature.   Sunlight is spread into a spectrum when it enters a spherical raindrop.   Sunlight is internally reflected on the backside of a raindrop.   All wavelengths refract at the same angle.      In a double-slit interference experiment, a wave from one slit arrives at a point on a screen one wavelength behind the wave from the other slit. What is observed at that point?       dark fringe   bright fringe   multicolored fringe   gray fringe, neither dark nor bright            How are lasers used to determine the distance from Earth to the moon?
