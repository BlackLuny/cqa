20090307071034AAJvOjk	Environment;Global Warming	Poll: Are you worried at the rate of global warming?	Okay... this question is NOT to discuss whether or not humans are the cause... the bottom line is that the arctic ice is melting.      Recent news is out that current predictions have been pushed back again. Scientists once thought that the summer arctic ice would have fully melted by 2100... then it was pushed back to something like 2050... then 2020... but the most recent data suggests that the arctic ice in the summer may be completely melted by 2013... 4 years from now!      I can't help but wonder what will happen to seals and polar bears... and that's a little frightening to me that what is supposed to be one of the coldest places on earth will be warm enough to lose all the ice!
