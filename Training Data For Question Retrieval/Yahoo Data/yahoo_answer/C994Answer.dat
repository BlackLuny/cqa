7xQfil4saa	Well we got some good scoring from Boyes Macdonald and others. Hopefully we do!!!! Go Blues!!!!|`|etErp8rcaa	As of today, they are only five points out of contention, not very much at all, considering there are still 24 games left to play for them. That being said, the bottom four playoff spots in the West are really up for grabs right now, with no teams totally out of the running yet.<br>  <br>  That being said, the Blues would have to finish better than a few pretty good teams to get in. My guess is they don't make it. The West this year should look something like:<br>  <br>  San Jose<br>  Detroit<br>  Calgary<br>  Chicago<br>  Dallas<br>  Vancouver<br>  Anaheim<br>  Columbus<br>  <br>  I really don't see the Blues moving up much from where they sit now (13th in the West). Sorry, but the competition is just too good.|`|L64dNc09aa	Not very likely, they are a very good team just they needed to be good in the beggining.|`|2sdKWuv1aa	They've been playing well lately,but it's too little too late because there's so many good teams ahead of them already.|`|zbCh3Lxpaa	<a href="http://sports12.weebly.com" rel="nofollow">http://sports12.weebly.com</a><br>  <br>  this website has every game playing in NHL all the time and is pretty well updated.

The Blues are looking better, but a lot depends on how the Preds play between now & the end of the season.|`|ULw1777caa	1 in a Trillion.  Good odds.|`|oWYs6Btgaa	It's not over until it's over- they are only 5 points out of the 8th seed as of today.<br>  However,<br>  The remainder of their schedule consists of 18 meetings against 11 teams with a winning record. <br>  Number of games against opponent in parentheses with current standing and points<br>  <br>  St. Louis is currently 13th with 57 pts<br>  <br>  Opponents remaining:<br>  Nashville currently in 12th with 58 <br>  (2)  Phoenix 14th with 57<br>  (3) Dallas 7th with 65 <br>  (3) Detroit 2nd with 84 <br>  Tampa 13th in East with 50 <br>  Florida 7th in East with 66<br>  (2) San Jose 1st with 87 <br>  Minnesota 10th with 60 <br>  Edmonton 8th with 62 <br>  (2) Vancouver 5th with 66 <br>  Calgary 3rd with 74<br>  LA 11th with 59 <br>  (3) Columbus 6th with 66<br>  Chicago 4th with 74 <br>  Colorado 15th with 55<br>  <br>  It looks grim for the Blues, but not impossible.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	They certainly have a shot being only 5 points out.  <br>  <br>  Their next two games are at home against teams that they are battling with.  At this point in the season these are really the so called '4 point games'  Also, of their next 16 games, 10 are at home (including a pair of home games against Detroit), but theye are a tough set (2 against Detroit, 1 against San Jose) with a 3 game Western Canadian road trip.  They end the season with 3 of their last 8 games against Columbus....a very good team, but beatable.<br>  <br>  If they can continue to do well at home, and play at least 0.500 on the road.  They will be in the fight|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	8.3 %.  They probably need to reach 90 pts, Maybe if they go 17-7-1 in their last 25 they can make it.  They haven't managed 3 game win streak since late November tho and they'll definitely be needing a few!|`|l5CKKXD3aa	The same probability that the Lions will win the Superbowl next year
e794c375099cc02b419541f8b43f89cbaa	Well over hear in the uk its totaly iligal and i expect it is where you are as well, my preferd choice would be a 243.<br>  But to answere your question, yes.<br>  A roe deer at 100 yrds with a shot placement to the hart<br>  with a v max 17grn balistic tip, with little wind ,<br>  How do i no this,, dont ask|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Use at least a .243-caliber.  You'll get a cleaner kill that way.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	Possible? ---- Yeah you could aim, pull the trigger but more than likely the deer will run off and die a slow painful death..... This isn't humane.... The idea is your supposed to use a cartridge / bullet big enough for the job to end its life quickly.....<br>  <br>  The absolute minimum size cartridge to ethically drop a deer is a .243 with a .270 or 30/30 being a better choice........|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Yes, but it is inhumane, unethical, illegal, and you would end up wounding far more Deer than actually killing them causing undue pain and suffering, sickness, and crippling them.*|`|dAK8dS4kaa	Possible? Yes<br>  Legal? No<br>  Humane? No<br>  <br>  It's also possible to kill a deer with a butter knife (granted you would have to be extremely lucky and talented)...doesn't make it a good idea.|`|7royFhIgaa	It's possible,But in most states it is to small of a caliber. Check with the DNR.|`|fB8ujUVNaa	NO! Illegal. Use 30.06.|`|dpSr0icwaa	Yes, it is possible at close range if you shoot the deer right between the eyes.<br>  <br>  it is a poacher's trick to 'shine' deer (hit em with a powerful spotlight, this disoreints the deer, and the deer eyes shine back brightly for the same reason they do in car headlights, and the same reason people's eyes can look red in photographs)<br>  <br>  Normally the poacher will use a 22 magnum or a 17 HMR to shoot the deer because it is a relatively quiet rifle.|`|SkN2NqpGaa	Is it possible...yes, it is "possible", but the bullet would have to hit in exactly the right place, and then penetrate far enough to do the required amount of damage. Not likely to happen with a .17 cal bullet, no matter how much "power" is behind it.. The question you really should ask is "Is it legal".<br>  <br>  Go ask the folks at your local DNR (Department of Natural Resources - sometimes called "Fish, Game & Wildlife") if it is legal. I'm betting they'll say "No, it is not legal to use a .17 cal rifle to hunt deer".|`|TPZwmQK9aa	In not a single one of our 50 states is this legal.  However, with the right bullet, given the high velocity of this round, you could certainly take deer with it.|`|UwsbuHZYaa	Not unless you like to torture animals. <br>  You really shouldn't use less than a .243.<br>  .270 .308 .30-06 is a better choice.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	sure, it is possible........But Illegal!!!!!|`|4AbXxowTaa	You would have to be point blank!!  Go with a .30-06.|`|EGKeYd0Waa	Yes its possible but illegal. Go with a .300 win mag|`|b4Y0gYlIaa	you had better be a dang good shot|`|FhuXtF4haa	a .17 is a rimfire cartridge and most states and provinces prohibited big game hunting with these rounds. If your talking a .17 rem its a bit better but a mach 2 and an HMR would just would the animal. Why would you ask this? It is a stupid question...if you can't aford a .243 30-06 or whatever then dont hunt deer it is unethical. Would you like to be shot with a .17 in the leg and have to live with the wound for the rest of your life. Im not an anti hunter i hunt all the imte but not with rim fire rifles.
iO12Vjnvaa	Dave, the rumor around Mooresville area (compliments of my buddies down there at the shops) say that THEY WILL campaign a Cup car on a limited basis by the end of this year. Mainly it'll be the #66 crew moving up to pit the car (so no new jobs unfortunately)...but it'll be a partnership between RWI and the Gaughn family. Since Brendon is driving the #62 this year it's rumored that he will get the first start since he has prior Cup experience....but Rusty wants it to be a plateau for Steven to move up to Cup on their terms and not anyone else's.<br>  <br>  Just an opinion as always.|`|sXMrY3uwaa	I think I read this on Jayski man...<br>  <br>  Yep, this is from JAYSKI<br>  <br>  RWI considering Cup: The union of two families with passionate racing backgrounds has led Rusty Wallace to seriously consider a 2009 Cup Series debut with his own team, and a possible full-time venture in the near future. In the offseason Wallace did a deal with Las Vegas businessman Michael Gaughan, whose family excelled in off-road and Truck Series racing. The deal put his son Brendan Gaughan, 33 -- an eight-time Truck Series winner and Wallace's former Cup teammate at Penske Racing -- in RWR's #62 car. "I do want to run some Cup races with Stephen this year, I do. And probably my best avenue to do something with that would be with Richard Childress. I'm a Chevy team; Richard builds all our motors [Earnhardt Childress Racing Technologies] -- it just kind of makes sense." Rusty Wallace said. "I never had a whole lot of desire to drive in the Nationwide Series," Gaughan said. "I liked the Camping World Trucks, and I wanted to get back to Sprint Cup, but on my own terms, and Rusty really has me excited about this. Doing this with Rusty is probably the only way I'd be this excited. He brings that out of me and out of all his guys. "I'm looking at this and saying, 'Yeah, I want to get back to Sprint Cup one day, on my terms, but I know that Rusty wants to maybe go Sprint Cup racing one day on his terms, with his team so if I can do well and me and [Steve] can work together and get it to where we both can run, then maybe I've found my home on my terms with a family organization that likes me, wants me and we can make a long future with.(NASCAR.com)(2-14-2009)|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	I've heard those rumors also, but I haven't heard it from Rusty Wallace, maybe he will talk about it during the Nationwide stuff on ESPN this weekend. I think Rusty could succeed. It just makes be think who is gonna be next RCI (Ricky Craven Inc) who knows.<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|n55igpCUaa	He's simply considering Cup again.

zJC18FtAaa	Muay Thai|`|NJMzhcKhaa	If your goal is to be in a sport Martial Art (MMA), then BJJ / Greco Roman Wrestling and muay thai is the most common training in the game.<br>  There are several notable fighters with different background<br>  George St. Pierre base is in Kyokushin karate<br>  Another one is Lyoto Machida, one that Anderson Silva already states he will never want to fight due to friendship.<br>  Lyoto is also a karateka and brought his fighting style to his undefeated status now.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	You generally don't develop your striking and kicking skill without focusing on just that aspect for a while.  Karate, Maui Thai, boxing, and kick-boxing will all do that for you a little better than just a MMA program.  I have a hybrid fighting class and my karate students kick way better and use their kicks way more effectively than someone with no karate experience.  Many of those students have been working on those punching/striking and kicking skills much more diligently and over a longer period of time.  Boxers develop their hand skills to a much higher level for the same reason as it is all they concentrate on developing along with the needed foot work, movement, and motion.<br>  <br>  Since you are drawn to wanting to knock people out I would opt for a year or two of boxing after which you should have some pretty good hand skills.  At the same time doing some other art like Judo, BJJ, or jujitsu while doing boxing will further compliment your fighting abilities and give you a great foundation to build your skills into MMA type fighting.|`|IGJWF3VBaa	Most MMA fighters do have some degree of training in Mauy Thai (some have a brief training of it while others are very skilled with the style). While it is the most common striking style used in MMA it is not the only one. <br>  <br>  Fighters have used Karate, TKD, Savat to name a few but Mauy Thai is the most common (and the most effective in a MMA fight from my point of view) So if you want to knock people out in MMA i suggest you learn some Mauy Thai.|`|IXgPHYbDaa	Muay thai is good to study if you want to work on striking. (thats what anderson silva studies)<br>  <br>  but he's also a blackbelt in BJJ (brazilian jujitsu)<br>  <br>  BJJ is the most effective martial art. <br>  <br>  90 percent of all fights end up on the ground, so having a grappling experience and rank pays off. You can use muay thai on the gound.<br>  <br>  So BJJ is the best way to go because they teach you how to fight on the ground, and also teach you how to strike .|`|f1f7IQIKaa	well First,to compete in MMA you have to be 18. so Don't day dream yet,if you are. Then you better get your azz to training,because its a long road ahead before you compete.  Anderson silva has long arms and legs,that help him. He swings hs monkey arms,and that's how he gets knock outs. I am not a fan of Him.|`|KzpZBMVOaa	Yes. Start with one.|`|JqUGmk3Paa	Striking is situational,  dont be a brawler-they never get far.  Start with BJJ and Muai Thai so you have grappling and ground game... There will always be someone who is going to beat you standing up.  The trick is to have grappling AND stand up.. But you have to start with the basics, which I would consider your martial arts and Muai Thai.  Dont forget that some vicious knockouts are delivered from the clinch.  Striking can be developed by a boxing instructor, but should not be your backbone.  You will get destroyed in the clinch or on the ground if you learn to box and fight a true mixed martial artist.|`|Vjh7WXpbaa	learn as much as u can it will help. i have passed his striking level twice.ha ha ha i am aka tenshi.

9Zbh8HZxaa	A sandbagger is a person who bowls a crappy game or series  on purpose usually to get a bigger handicap or to receive a higher score in the next game or series|`|C2HHfun2aa	You usually see sandbaggers in handicap leagues. In handicap leagues calculate your average score and then you get a handicap based on that score. The lower your average score the higher your handicap and the higher your score the lower your handicap. Sandbaggers will bowl lower scores than they usually do to get a higher handicap so that when they bowl their normal scores they actually get an advantage.|`|YoraqaNjaa	this definition is actually for golf but I am pretty sure it works for bowling also. <br>  Definition: 1. Generally, any golfer who misleads others about his ability level, claiming to be worse than he actually is at golf.<br>  <br>  2. More specifically, a golfer who artificially inflates his handicap index in order to better his chances of nonscientificaments or bets.<br>  <br>  A sandbagger is considered by many to be the lowest form of life on a golf course. Sandbaggers can inflate their handicap indexes by selectively leaving out their best rounds of golf when they post scores for handicap purposes.|`|AA10051358	Someone who deliberately keeps his score low in the first round

b9ShNrWoaa	I dont know about NBA, but my boys play National and even thogh they're mixed (3 black, 1 Indian, 1 Arabian, 3 Europeans and 1 Aussie) they manage just fine. I have noticed though that the white guys (especially the 6'8" German and 6'3" Russian) seem more intimidated by black people on the opposing team....They watch alot of NBA though so maybe they think every darkskinnd/black person out there is JUST AS GOOD as Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant.|`|HLzS2z9laa	most black players in nba dont act ghetto at all, they are classy, and everybody is aware they are playin in nba on tv in america controlled by white men, its a money game when you look at the big picture, its not about black and white, if u about money you wil act white, if you wanna act ghetto then you cant even make it college|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Hmm, good question.  I guess maybe that could be the case or that the white people were not brought up in ghetto's or slums and therefore never have ever had confrontations with other people before.  I am not saying all black people are from the ghetto but a majority of the ones in the NBA do come from poor neighborhoods, where violence and murders happen on occasion.  I wouldn't say intimidated, yet more unused to being aggressive in nature.|`|Nuj1eScCaa	No sir<br>  <br>  I don't think they are intimidated, in fact nobody in the NBA is intimidated, if they were they wouldn't be in the NBA.<br>  <br>  Take Matt Bonner for example, he looks very bookish or nerdy but he's earned his respect in the league by players of all races. The point is if you do your job and play your game it doesn't matter what color you are. I play at the YMCA quite a bit and I'm one of two white guys there but it doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  As far as ghetto neighborhoods, most other whites and blacks I play with refuse to play in ghetto neighborhoods. It doesn't matter, you can get shot over there no matter what color you are.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I think they could be.  I mean, like it was said, back in the day some of your white guys would go out and brawl and weren't afraid of anyone, guys like Laimbeer.  But nowadays, they probably don't want to get into it.  I mean, lets be honest here, who knows if youre own teammates would have your back or if they would on you and support their own.  Any time theres something between a white and black guy, race is always brought up, and you wouldn't want to be the guy that 90% of the league is against cuz they think your racist.|`|lbAftZFmaa	some of the white american guys are for sure. None of those european or south american guys are. They grew up in neighborhoods that were really awful so they are experienced brawlers. There were some old school white guys like kurt rambis and danny ainge that would brawl with anyone but no current white guys off the top of my head.|`|BntHQeWMaa	thats why you gotta ball and prove your good enough.. talkin only gets you so far..walk the walk and you earn respect.|`|QBrsrS6haa	You have to take into account that many white players are just more finesse players or just pure shooters. The ones that are not finesse players are willing to go in there and bang it out with everyone else. Just look at Brad Miller. He is about as gritty as it gets.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	It looks that way when they always play. And it sux too because I'm white and they just make us look bad!<br>  <br>  I honestly think I can do a much better job than most of the white guards in the NBA.

How many years, over 100, will it be between Cubs WS.<br>  <br>  And I don't mean it as a dis (since it already is over 100), in fact, I'm a Dodgers fan and if we don't make it, I'm pullin for you guys, but its a bold prediction for a team that hasnt won since 1907.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	The Cubs will win between 90-99 games because they play in the weakest division in all of baseball.<br>  <br>  If their record is better than that of the NL West Champion, the Cubs will be eliminated by the Wild Card team.  If the NL West Champion has a better record than the Cubs, the Cubs will be eliminated by the NL East Champion.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Many Cub fans will always say it's the Cubs year only to be let down & it's been going on for what, 100 years now & to call the Yankees pathetic is really pathetic coming from a team who hasn't won a WS in your lifetime while the Yankees have won 26 since the Cubs last one & I may not have seen all 26, but I did witness the Yankees winning 6 & if that's calling the Yankees pathetic, then you need a reality check|`|iz5zDFxvaa	First of all, the Cubs are still cursed!<br>  Second, don't call the Yankees pathetic.

I promise you they will choke for the 101 time.<br>  <br>  <br>  A monkey is even smart enough to know they wont win.|`|qn50rmQOaa	I can guarentee you right now that the Cubs will not, I repeat, will NOT win 100 games this year. They have lost several pieces of their bullpen, and didn't really get anything solid in their trades (Marquis, Pie, and Hill) Milton Bradley probably won't be healthy either, especially since he is playing RF full time.

This is in no way necessary, though some teams choose to do it to acknowledge the players that helped them all season and contributed towards the championship season, even the ones who weren't fortunate enough to still be a member of the team at the end.|`|IUxM3brbaa	they get "waterboy" edition of ring|`|BntHQeWMaa	sure they do..even the 14 or 15th person thats never played all season get a ring|`|B5O60Ixjaa	yes they are part of the team for being in the team's roster|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Why yes they do.  They are still apart of the team.

3teWTOPqaa	I count how many times Pierce has faked an injury to help me when I can't sleep, I usually get up to about 106 and I fall asleep laughing.<br>  <br>  Steve Nash is given a green light to do whatever he wants to on offense and he played 4 years under the D'Antoni system as the leader, so I think we will see the Suns pick it up more, but as the past has shown us the Suns can't win that way.|`|NEtVRjplaa	drink some tea and listen to mellow music.<br>  <br>  bq: I think they might be. For me, it's a hard to tell because they have only played against one team so far. I do think they are better off now though.|`|u2QhQAxzaa	I eat cereal and it makes me go to sleep.  <br>  <br>  The Suns have only played the Clippers so far.  Therefore, you can't exactly judge them when they are playing one of the worst teams in the league 2 nights in a row.  But I will say they seem to be scoring more and letting Nash take over the reins some more.|`|BntHQeWMaa	yep just close your eyes, free/clear your mind..as if everythings black! start off on your back..roll to the left side then the right side and eventually your out... dont wanna sleep on oneside too long it will go numb!|`|tzrLDbHWaa	LMAO @ MC|`|m501HwyWaa	count sheep|`|QuLapuE7aa	just go to you bed and close your eyes and don't think of any ;D<br>  <br>  bq: I think it's too early to tell, I want to see them do it againts elite teams. but scoring 140 points in two games is really impressive and the suns were really fastbreaking even shaq!|`|L0ft1eo7aa	MC is good watch a movie half way threw the movie ull fall asleep <br>  <br>  suns maybe am not convice yet until they play another team besides the clippers|`|OxS3UVE6aa	have a beer. then try to read. haha.<br>  <br>  suns will have to work a little more. the west won't tolerate anything|`|mzhFrm5Taa	its 'etc' not 'ect'..by the way.<br>  <br>  and yes, yes i do.|`|vG0Ni0qDaa	just go to your bed.<br>  <br>  bq: i think suns are back.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Just shut your eyes<br>  <br>  BQ:Yeah|`|I2GnFoTLaa	read, it will make you fall asleep within 10 min! it works...trust me.|`|IUxM3brbaa	i typically overdose on pain pills when i am having trouble sleeping. works a charm|`|N5Cnuay0aa	lol at the 2nd answer.

lbAftZFmaa	Ask ur coach first of all. Then run several miles each day. Then shoot 500 free throws, 500 3 pointers, and 500 half court shots every day. Then read some John Wooden and Michael Jordan books. Also lift weights frequently. Go to the hood and play basketball all day with some tough thugs as often as possible. Play games of 3 on 1 and u have no teammates. Have ur teammates visit ur house (or their's) and have spring and summer practice. Work on ur chemistry with them. Watch some Harlem Globetrotter videos and And1 mixtapes and learn some trick moves. If everyone on ur team does this u will easily become state champs next year!|`|u2QhQAxzaa	Lift weights, work on your game everyday, and stay focused on your goals.|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	BC pretty much said it all. I can add stay in shape by jogging/ running everyday and watch what you eat|`|YiHRHca9aa	Just keep grinding and keep working hard. Work out, better your game, become a more vocal leader if you can. And keep your head up. Don't let a bad season or a season that wasn't so good get you down. And remember you team is family. So spend time and grow with them, you guys will have great chemistry and you will be more comfortable with each other. And have fun. Its a great sport.|`|BntHQeWMaa	well put more effort? practice makes 'perfect'. work on your whole game or the parts that are lacking.<br>  <br>  <br>  practice all off season. every day after school and on weekends or whenever your bored.. just dont over do it where the game gets old..enjoy|`|L0ft1eo7aa	practice practice  practice|`|IUxM3brbaa	Due to your efforts, you will be traded to the local rival school next year for a rookie.
akUibcJWaa	grip continental<br>  bend knees<br>  toss behind you (pretend to toss over your shoulder)<br>  hit up on the ball<---key<br>  <br>  try this drill: stand on your knees and do the tips above, especially hitting up that will help you get the ball over the net, so when you are on your feet you can hit even higher and harder<br>  <br>  hope this helps! it did for me|`|cP7Z7fifaa	try throwing the ball closer to you. This will enable you to create a lot of spin thus creating the kick.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Get your body into it!!!!<br>  <br>  Right before the serve just try to get like really intense, just think, " i am gonna hit this so hard" Then throw the ball up, bend your legs (i mean really bend your legs) Lean back, and i mean way back. Then extended all the way through. It'll be hard to get in at first but it will get you a more more speed and kick on it.<br>  <br>  If you just want kick though, just focus on brushing up on the ball, not hitting it fast.|`|OppuEFVzaa	Find good instructor. Serve is not simple thing. If you have wrong technique you will have shoulder or wrist injuries. Good serve is obligatory for wining the match. Elements are important but most important thing is synchronous combination of them.Good serve is not only force and speed. Don't forget about the second serve it must be good too This is different technique.
HsnZKAbAaa	Overal this is a very good team....you pitching is amazing and your lineup is solid. Just dont be surprised if delgado doesnt preform well, he is getting up thier in age and is very streaky. Then you also need to be carful with Matsui and his responce to all his injuries, so dont expect him to get as much playing time as he has in the past. If i were you i would try to trade one of your pitchers, like Weaver, in combination with delgado or matsui, that way you can get a more dependable player.|`|U3KAgO0baa	IMO its 2 early 2 draft but you have  a very solid team...

Those are his three greatest assets. He's the kind of player that can help break open a game, but under the windy and drenched conditions the U.S. and Mexico played under his greatest strengths were completely canceled out. Yes he didn't play as well as we are all normally used to seeing but had the pitch been dryer his speed and quickness would have made much more of an impact on the game.<br>  <br>  And to add to that, it's a shame he's not getting much time at Tottenham, it was supposed to be his show once he got there but somehow he's sitting the bench.

Eto'o is not that good realy....|`|4BppP7Mkaa	David Villa is defiantly the best striker is the world.|`|MUERDKyzaa	It's always been David Villa, Torres has always paled in comparison. He does it all on his own at Valencia and Eto'o relies on messi and xavi way to much.|`|7Xridrxaaa	Fernando Torres and David Villa are the best in the world. Eto'o and Zlatan are close behind|`|yVMGqyIwaa	The Prince of Milan.....<br>  <br>  <br>  Alexandre Pato!!!<br>  <br>  (The King is Kaka)|`|Yb0182Vxaa	I'd say David Villa is the best|`|kbIHYS5xaa	Statisticly speaking its Eto'o this season.. but ive never trusted the statistic.<br>  <br>  I would still say that its between Eto'o, Ibra, Villa & Torres. <br>  Id pick Ibra & Torres as first just because especially Ibra has the skills like midfield players do, + he is very tall so its harder for him to be like that. Then again he misses some chances Villa or Eto'o would never miss.. then again he scores goals none does. I just wouldnt be able to pick, it wouldnt be fair to others, but they are the elite right now.|`|oM0gMI3Daa	A striker is only as good as the supply he gets so Eto'o and Villa have had an unfair advantage!! Torres may not have scored as many as Villa or Eto'o but when you look at the supply he has had compared to the other two he has still done well. Now he is at a team that creates as many chances as the other two he is scoring regularly and looking a class act. However all of these pale in comparison with the mighty Nicolas Bentner lol|`|Rpxo33PUaa	hmmmm...I think it's unfair to label the EPL as an inferior league b/c of Torres' greater success there when you consider Freddie Kanoute's and Diego Forlan's respective successes in the La Liga after both were less than impressive in the EPL. <br>  <br>  In answering your question, I think an argument can be made for Ruud Van Nistelrooy.  A major success at both Man United and Real Madird.|`|UEaxNCd5aa	C.Ronaldo and Messi are not strikers they're wing forwards so if we're talkin about a CF or an SS my vote would go to Eto'o. He's fast, agile and has very powerful shots. And also remember that C.Ronaldo scored all those goals as a winger not a striker so it's pretty impressive.|`|HraimwiDaa	I think of those two... Villa.<br>  Eto'o is great, but he has a suplly line from Messi, Xavi and Iniesta.<br>  <br>  Overall I think Van Gol is the best ever... well, second to Brazilian Ronaldo. Maybe.<br>  <br>  That is very true, EPL strikers score way too often.<br>  Van Nistelrooy scored about 20/season in EPL and now only 15ish (if he can stay fit).<br>  Torres did the opposite.|`|tZm19KRJaa	the best striker in the world is Etoo right now, apart from MESSI.<br>  <br>  @Draganfly, thats not what your mom and sister said after i was done with them with my 10 inch rod hahah|`|HGDrlPcdaa	David Villa is the best|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Christian Vieri :P hahaha <br>  <br>  You know I like Villa ;)|`|L1QTSErIaa	It's actually neither. Good strikers needs to prove themselves outside their own country. There are lots of players who have ventured abroad and failed. Villa is reluctant to leave sunny Spain. And Eto'o has been playing with great players around him which makes him look good. He is yet to prove himself outside Spain. <br>  When it comes to best striker, only Torres comes to mind. He is proven himself in Spain and England and at the international level. His first touch is exquisite and finishing lethal. This despite playiing alone upfront. He is truely world class.
obPSaYf3aa	They're trying to show the public that what the media was feeding them was baloney.  If these alleged "superhuman steroid freaks" did benefit from PED's, then why did they suck during AS Home Run Derbies, especially Barry Bonds and anyone "NOT" named Sammy Sosa, Jason Giambi or Mark McGwire.  <br>  <br>  Barry Bonds never won one single World Series or Home Run Derby he participated in.  If he truly was benefitting from PED's, then he would win the Home Run Derby, help his team to the playoffs every season and win the World Series.  So far he's never experienced that happening.....|`|M0eyMvqlaa	So do we hold against the players who weren't using steroids ?  I don't think that would be fair.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	The annual Home Run Derby bores the snot out of me for two reasons.<br>  <br>  One is ESPN's production. They overglorify this fundamentally silly event, try to build it up as some great, tension-filled battle. And then, just to milk it for what little it is worth (since there's no other baseball that night), they cram it full of commercials, breaking any worthwhile flow to the contest. And, yes, Berman is annoying. Once upon a time he tried, really did try, to become a "baseball guy". He failed; he's a football guy through and through, and just cannot get into the great game. (One would think being a football guy would transfer well to the HRD, since it's all about spectacle and not at all about a competition. But no.) <br>  <br>  The second is, the Derby is just bomb after bomb after bomb after bomb... geez, that's dull. A home run in the context of a game can be exciting, as it changes the lead or closes the gap or just breaks a tense moment into utter joy for one side and near-despair for the other. Homers in a game serve a purpose. The Derby is just a dog-and-pony show. Interspersing this are some candid micro-interviews with the hitters or sideline players, and while they are great ballplayers and occasionally offer insight after a game, what do they have to say here? "Yeah, I hit it really well." "Oh, man, did you see that one?" Snore. Not the most fascinating speakers, and given nothing worth talking about. At least put some "hit sign, win steak" posters around the outfield wall. The Derby will still suck, but it'll have some bonus entertainment value.<br>  <br>  Because, seriously, when the Century 21 donation counter (for hitting homers with the golden balls) is the most interesting part of the telecast, you know there's something not right with the proceedings.|`|CjdCuWb1aa	no.<br>  the mlb shouldn't be penelized if their players don't follow the rules.

Then figure that Nascar is Southern United States. We are from Ireland, Scotland and England. The Vikings figure in there too, as well as the good looking indians acknowledged and unacknowledged.<br>  <br>  Our paternal lineage for everyone on the planet goes back to a man in Africa about seventy-four thousand years ago who was not named Adam nor was he the only man alive at that time. The maternal lineage goes back over one hundred thousand years which is still not much in evolutionary terms. Her name was not Eve. She was not the only woman alive at that time. But everyone traces their maternal lineage back to her.<br>  <br>  Since most of our ancestors have been in Western Europe since the ice age the links are much closer than that.|`|TYc6nAUsaa	What's up with Elliot Sadler?

yEsw7UkWaa	Mark Calaway (Taker) and Glen Jacobs (Kane) are not related by blood but have been best friends for many years. Taker is a couple of years older than Kane, hence the older half-brother storyline.<br>  Kane and Taker were the best man at each others weddings (Kane wed Maurisa in 1995 - Taker married Sara in 2000/divorced in 2007ish)<br>  <br>  So while they aren't blood brothers they're as close as you can get to it.|`|1yOdrYiHaa	It is just apart of the story line they aren't actually brothers in real life. The Undertaker's real name is Mark Callway and he is from Houston Texas and was born in 1965. Kane's real name is Glen Jacobs and he is born from Spain in 1967.|`|9ijwrcTZaa	no, IN THE story, they are half - bros.

6AFvANHtaa	The person who gets whipped with towels after the showers and people shout squeal piggy squeal|`|0xfVyxxIaa	To be the biggest lummix on the field and to throw that weight around.|`|Ml6mMDlvaa	The primary responsibilities of a prop are scrummaging and lifting in the lineout. <br>  <br>  In my opinion there are different types of props. I'm going to use Ireland as an example as I think it best contrasts the two.<br>  <br>  1st Type: This would be the lighter more mobile prop that takes on a lot of ball, is generally faster than the other. ala Marcus Horan<br>  <br>  2nd type: This would be a bigger probably stronger type that doesn't really do much in attack but is brilliant in defence. If you ever watch an Ireland match you'll always see John Hayes around the side of the ruck as a pillar, generally if someone picks and goes in that direction, they don't go too far.<br>  <br>  In general, props perform more work in the tight. In attack that means pick and goes and in defence it means pillars. Also pretty rare to see a prop kick. <br>  <br>  This is just a basic generalisation, there are obviously exceptions to the rule. Tony Woodcock, best prop in the world in my opinion, seems to be able to combine both roles pretty well.|`|DgS3MwYraa	An Prop SCRUMS!!!<br>  <br>  1 is normally taller because he anchors the scrum and gets the left shoulder (which is better attacking ball). # prop is shorter and tries to get beneath his taller (nr.1) oppostion prop.<br>  <br>  They also support the tall and heavy jumpers in the line out.<br>  <br>  They are less mobile than other forwards and their job is mainly to act as pillars at rucks/mauls and basically just support the guys lighter than them on the field. You know, they have to throw their weight around|`|nG4MfEbCaa	Your main job is to be the fattest player on the team and to fall asleep when the ref says crouch touch pause enzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz|`|Xu0XoB4jaa	Eat all the pies and then lean on the scrum getting over the indigestion.

V0ruWwNpaa	Red color is an imitation of blood or a wounded bait fish. that's why they make hooks in red too.|`|TGm36rBWaa	You are right about the color red.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in trying this color pattern on other lures or plastics, try using a spike it dye marker. Be careful though, if you use it on a hard lure, it could be permanent. <br>  <br>  I use my red one a lot on my light colored plastics, I will just die the tail of a zoom fluke, craw or worm. I will do this to change up the look of the lure and it works well.<br>  <br>  Spike it dye markers are a fast and easy way to change up the color of your lure, it takes literally seconds.|`|amlmhoUuaa	I'm not really sure why they like it ,but they do it maybe the red or it could be the action of the bait you use.  No matter the reason it works and that's good enough for me.

bBMKMd97aa	for one can you bmx?if not dont go blow your money on something really exspensive then decide that you hate the sport first try it out.buy buying an old bike on ebay for around 50 dollars.see how you if you like buy a new.|`|hPov8DZRaa	I would say to get a Specialized Fuse 1, 2, 3 are either my favourite bikes. They are light perfect for jumping and its a practical bmx bike, good for Street BMX'ing. <br>  <br>  The fuse 1 is the best for you $330 there are cheaper ones but they are a good bike as my friend has one.|`|PkDOw7dBaa	I agree with Charly... you dont want to go out and buy a $400 bike to turn aroud and sell it two months later. Plus while learning you will definitely screw it up. Spend $50-$100 on a good used bike, and just keep upgrading it as the parts break or wear out. Eventually, you'll end up with a new frame, too. So over time you'll end up with an amazing custom bike if you stick with it.

oTb67zNYaa	by the time you get to legal age to do mma you will most likely lost interest you have 6 years before you can sign a liability waver in case you get hurt this gives you time to work on a longer training time system like karate personally I would work on a defense aspect art for now as opposed to working on a sport style like muai tai or bjj|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Some forms of Karate are NOT useless and have allot of sparing like kyokushin. Karate does get a bad rep here in the states because of all the Mcdojos and crappy teachers who care more about money, than seeing their students excel in competition. <br>     MMA gyms are better because the coaches like to see their students excel in compotetion and bring more fame and name recognition to the gym, thats why I would suggest MMA gyms they want to raise good fighters. Most Karate Dojos in the states now days don't give a crap about sparring, tradition, or anything just cash.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	BJJ would be the best but it is very hard and only for the ground. Do it with Muay Thai, if he is every in a street fight and knew Muay Thai, he wouldn't have a problem handling anyone but if it goes on the ground, he would be killed unless he knew BJJ.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	I would have to agree with Fair there.  Tweens like yourself usually do better later if they have a good foundation in something from earlier.  BJJ or karate will give that to you as well as make you more coach-able and give you a better appreciation for good technique.  You will then more easily learn other aspects of martial arts and fighting.  It is ten times easier for me to teach a person like that when they are in their later teens or early twenties.  They learn and pick up things easier and generally will do them better than someone that does not have a good foundation in some kind of fundamental martial art.  <br>  <br>  Any martial art if it is taught properly and done at a high level can be  effective while at the same time each has its weaknesses.  That is the reason why many cross-train and dabble in other arts.  Start with just BJJ or karate, get a good foundation to build and learn from and by the time you are twenty and cross-training and dabbling in other arts like Maui Thai you will have an awesome repertoire of skills and probably better technique than you would have otherwise.|`|IXgPHYbDaa	Karate is useless when it come's to REAL LIFE fighting. <br>  all it is, is fancy unrealistic kicks and techniques that arent possible in a real street fight or mma bout.<br>  <br>  Brazilian jujitsu, is the most effective martial art for real life situations and MMA bouts.<br>  <br>  Muay thai is also good, but not as effective as BJJ. <br>  <br>  90 percent of all fights end up on the ground, so having experience in grappling is a most. (wrestling,BJJ,SAMBO is what you should study)<br>  <br>  Boxing, muay thai,sambo is good for stand up.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|KzpZBMVOaa	wow that is a lot of money. Sure go ahead and start. I say start just with one or the other and make sure there are some people at least close to your size, if you are skinny like I was.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	Those that say Karate is useless definitely need to have their brain checked.<br>  Each Martial Art in their pure form has their own advantages.<br>  <br>  Not to mention those idiot that call Karate useless then go on about BJJ and MuayThai because it's useful in real life and MMA, when two of the most dominant fighters in UFC have their base in Karate (GSP and Lyoto Machida)<br>  <br>  Now go on with the question.<br>  Go with Brazilian Jujitsu, since you're very young, I always say that the fact that you're young and naturally still flexible is an advantage to train in BJJ, later on, maintaining flexibility is much easier than attaining it when you're older.<br>  You can leave Karate or Muay Thai for much later, but it sounds that the trainer will be the same guy for MuayThai and Jujitsu, so you can ask him to teach you how to throw punch properly.<br>  <br>  The reason being, in BJJ, real sparring is to roll. Grappling might leave burn marks on skins, but that's about it, you train well without bad damage, easy to explain to your parents when you're still 12yrs old.<br>  <br>  By the time you reach 18, your BJJ should be at pretty high level if you start from 12. Then you can train either in Muay Thai or Karate. A standup martial art like Muay Thai or Karate, if it's a credible school, will have proper sparring sessions after 6 months training.<br>  If there's no proper sparring session, then run away from that dojo since big chance it will be a McDojo that will just get your money and teach you crap. Sparring is one of the most important aspect of martial art as you can only learn how to fight by fighting.<br>  A proper sparring session in a standup martial art could easily lead to bruises, something that you don't want to have to explain to your parents until you're older (you don't want to be banned from practice by protective parents----been there done that)<br>  <br>  If you have good solid base in Martial art and the training discipline by then, a study of standup martial art for 2 years will be enough if you want to join an MMA tournament.<br>  If your goal is pure self defense, do take classes in escrima or kali silat as they will teach you the weapon side of fighting. That will complete you as a fighter with knowledge of ground fighting, standup and weapon (stick/knife).<br>  <br>  So, there you go, Good Luck|`|ceiaGsLdaa	Lol @ The Realest Guy at is failure. He says karate is fake, and then suggested boxing. What a load.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I would go for BJJ if you really want to get into MMA later on in life. The "MMA Gyms" are going to teach you a little of everything, but they won't give you the experience of taking years of different kinds of martial arts. So I would suggest either finding a Muay Thai or BJJ gym and start there and see how you feel about it.<br>  <br>  If you're not ready for MMA yet, you can also try a form of Karate. But make sure it's a kind that has regular sparring, and teaches legit traditional stuff too.|`|e7eeXYpbaa	Look, who ever says that karate is not useful in real life is dead wrong. And I mean DEAD wrong. Even if you know BJJ, and some guy that's bigger than you, and stronger than you, and maybe has a knife takes you down, there's no way you're reversing, or getting him into the guard, because if he's attacking you, he's not gonna follow any rules what so ever, he's not going to stay in the guard or mount, and do some moves, he's gonna wanna kick your ***, punch your face, and stab you. <br>      I say 100% go for karate, so you can AVOID getting to the ground and have to use any skill. It's not like the guy attacking you is gonna have any mercy, like if he gets on top of you and you're at the ground, he's not going to get you tap out, he's gonna be giving you blows to the head. What if he has other people, it's a 3 on 1, or a 4 on 1, how's jiu jitsu gonna save you know?<br>       So my best advice is learn Karate, preferably kyoko-shin, that's what I do, it's really intense, but it's up to you. Now the most important thing is to learn to use your legs, get very strong legs, very fast kicks, and very fast punches, I work more on my flexibility, than my strength, because if the guy is smaller than me, the kicks would just knock him out, and if he's bigger, my strength wouldn't do much to his. Learn to kick fast, spin fast, work on your side kick, you'll get more confidence, you'll be faster, you'll kick *** harder.<br>       If the attacker is rushing towards you, knock him out with a kick, kick his groin, kick the inside of his leg, kick his ribs, knock out his face. So I personally recommend you go for Karate.|`|f1f7IQIKaa	Karate is suit for a 12 year old,MMA is harsh,although I doubt they will push you to any limits,I suggest Karate because at least you will have a lighter fighting experience,wait till you are 14,then train in MMA. I am saving your neck kid. also The realest Guy. You cant be a MMA/BJJ fan boy on Yahoo Answers Fighting boards. I am but,I cant show it :p.|`|aO5ErghMaa	Karate is useless try the Muay thai its a good fighting style.

18e2151919f80101e6b1310524ec221caa	If you mean "power" as in pain, yes. If you mean "power" as strength, no. Power does usually come from the hips if you are adept at properly shifting your weight and putting all your weight behind your punch. Here, you are utilizing your lower body strength.<br>  But power can also come from the back. We have muscles in our back that are called trapezius muscles. I think its commonly called as "traps" for short. The bigger the trapezius muscles, the more power there is in your punches. Here, you are utilizing your upper body strength.|`|Vjh7WXpbaa	that is not power that mean something is wrong.|`|KzpZBMVOaa	the power should come from your HIPS.|`|2oIVTQEEaa	it is part but not totally

tzrLDbHWaa	Doesn't really matter.  I mean, if you're coming from Miami, Florida, Oklahoma, FSU, USC, etc you'll get more exposure overall, but you'll also have a lot more competition for PT at those schools as well.  You'd almost be better going somewhere like Texas Tech, Northwestern, Wisconsin, schools that are still D1, sometimes are good, but you'll get more PT at and a better chance to dominate.  <br>  <br>  If you're truley good enough to make the NFL, don't worry, the scouts will find you.  I mean, the best LB in this years draft, by far, is Aaron Curry and he's from Wake Forest.  You also have like the 6th best, Larry English, who's likely a 2nd round pick out of Northern Illinois.  So there are players from not so mainstream football schools who will get drafted, then you have 2-4 among LBs as likely being all from USC.  So, again, take your pick.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	Any of the major programs will put you into a position to be drafted if you have the talent.

He didnt take a single snap.<br>  <br>  Look at all the high selection busts.  Leinhart, Bush, Mike Williams, and there are many more if you toss in the whole of the first two rounds.<br>  <br>  It seems all you pretty much need to do is start for USC, and you automatically will have some interest from the NFL.  If you play a skill position,  especially QB, you pretty much are going to the NFL.

A formal game of cricket can last anything from an afternoon to several days. <br>  <br>  Although the game play and rules are very different, the basic concept of cricket is similar to that of baseball. Teams bat in successive innings and attempt to score runs, while the opposing team fields and attempts to bring an end to the batting team's innings. After each team has batted an equal number of innings (either one or two, depending on conditions chosen before the game), the team with the most runs wins<br>  <br>  This should completely help you mate- <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/hosking/cricket/explanation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/hosking/c...</a><br>  <br>  If not feel free to ask me anything!|`|ygDC4JFYaa	since u r new to cricket the following links will helps<br>  ======================================<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cricket" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket</a><br>  <br>  to play cricket and understand basics online<br>  ==================================<br>  <a href="http://www.stickcricket.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stickcricket.com/</a>|`|0A5K6wfuaa	You can solve this problem to visit these sites<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sportsworldsite.com/" rel="nofollow">http://sportsworldsite.com/</a><br>  www.cricinfo.com|`|AA11088802	chk wiki

c3af48df18351d4c337821aa60e235dbaa	Bargnani era un campione qui in Italia e lo diventera' anche nella Nba...deve soltanto fare esperienza, affinare alcuni aspetti del suo gioco (il suo tiro e' fantastico, ma e' la selezione che deve migliorare, a volte esagera)...Nowitzki nel suo primo anno Nba gioco' peggio, faceva meno di 10 punti a partita e lui stesso ha ammesso che Bargnani e' piu' forte di quanto fosse lui alla sua eta'...probabilmente non vincera' il titolo di rookie dell'anno (Roy di Portland sembra il piu' maturo, in questo senso, non Morrison che e' in calando e che tira con pessime percentuali)...al contrario di quanto scrive qualcuno sopra, al Rookie Game ci DOVEVA essere assolutamente...piu' che Belinelli (che comunque sembra entrera' nelle prime 15-20 scelte se non prima) io aspettero' Gallinari, questo e' il piu' forte di tutti...|`|b5b565335ffa0aa8d741f03724197e9daa	Sta migliorando... è stato nominato rookie of the month ed è stato convocato al rookie challenge dell'all-star game.

Credo che si giocherà il premio di rookie dell'anno insieme a Brandon Roy e Adam Morrison, se continua così ce la può fare, visto che ha guadagnato finalmente la fiducia del coach....<br>  L'unica nota, vedendo le partite di Toronto, è che stia tirando troppo, infatti registra meno di un assist a partita, e in questo deve ancora migliorare....

a6b9d2d968427e6adac43fce5f97fe82aa	La palabra inteligencia es muy abierta por lo que mucha gente puede o no estar deacuerdo.<br>  Efectivamente, el jugar ajedrez ejercita la mente al igual que si haces ejercicio. <br>  Si alguien no hace ejercicio pues se le hara bastante pesado hacer cosas sencillas como subir una escalera, etc.<br>  Del mismo modo, si no ejercitas tu mente pues se te hará mas dificil razonar cosas no tan simples. Sin embargo tambien se requieren de conocimientos para poder obtener resultados en el proceso que se da en la inteligencia. Por ejemplo, serás muy inteligente pero si te digo a cuantas millas equivalen 20 Kms ? De nada te sirve ser inteligente si no sabes a cuanto equivale una milla en km.<br>  Otra cosa, el ajedrez como el ejercicio, ejercita una parte de la mente mas no toda. El jugar ajedrez puede que no te desarrolle mentalmente para una relación de pareja, un liderazgo, ó como llevar una amistad ó como superar la muerte de un pariente. Esto tambien requiere inteligencia pero el ajedrez nos ayuda poco en esto.<br>  Por otro lado, quien juega bien ajedrez no necesariamente es mas inteligente ya que el ajedrez requiere aprender ciertas tecnicas y reglas que el oponente puede no tener muy desarrollado.<br>  Lo que si creo es que el ajedrez te ense?a a ser objetivo y a definir los pasos para llegar a una meta, a identificar puntos debiles aunque en un escenario diferente a la vida.|`|8394e5936aebef9ee10585a3366dcadfaa	No, no es una herramienta para hacer mas lista a la gente.<br>  Pero si es una forma de mantener ejercitado el cerebro.<br>  recuerda que el cerebro es como un musculo, hay que ejercitarlo para que funcione bien<br>  <br>  saludos|`|UtZfKZmkaa	Hola, no es que seas mas listo por aprender ajedrez, lo que sucede es que te forma un criterio en tu manera de pensar, antes de decidir algo haces una evaluación de la situación y eliges la mejor respuesta, Lo mismo pasa con la gente que estudia carreras técnicas y la gente que estudia carreras de letras. piensan diferente, ven las cosas desde otro punto de vista.<br>  Saludos<br>  <a href="http://www.todoajedrez.com.ar" rel="nofollow">http://www.todoajedrez.com.ar</a>|`|a2e8707fbfb5567f0b3cf4d06c136fe4aa	la inteligencia es como los músculos, de tal forma que desde que naces, tienes definida tu capacidad muscular y tu capacidad intelectual.<br>  <br>  Así, el ajedrez no aumenta tu inteligencia, pero sí desarrolla tu capacidad intelectual.<br>  <br>  Por eso se le llama el deporte ciencia.<br>  <br>  Desde el punto de vista del desarrollo intelectual y la capacidad del jugador de generar estrategias, sí se puede decir que los ni?os que lo aprenden son más listos.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|ba0ca874609bcffefa15aab97857e59eaa	Realmente no, lo unico que hace es incrementar tu habilidad mental, pero requieres de otros ejercicios para desarrollar a un ni?o inteligente, es disciplina, actividad fisica, etc|`|df60ee6e35fe7c81442a99def1f62c9baa	Yo creia eso, pero ahora no.

AA10395295	MIS RESPETOS<br>  Hace un a?o tuve la oportunidad de ir a la arena México a ver un casting de luchadores.

a24c8439ae79b9931a27b6e3f00502aaaa	Hi. On June 4th, 1986, Kerry was in a horrendous motorcycle accident that nearly ended his life. With a dislocated hip and a badly injured right leg, Kerry was in bad shape. Doctors tried hard, but could not save his foot, eventually amputating it. According to brother Kevin, Kerry injured the foot following surgery by attempting to walk on it prematurely, crushing the bones beyond repair and thus forcing the doctors to amputate it. He was able to continue wrestling after the accident with a fused ankle.<br>  <br>  Kerry was able to keep his amputation secret for a while. However, during a match on an AWA card in Las Vegas against Colonel DeBeers, Kerry's secret was exposed. During the bout, DeBeers ended up on the outside, but he grabbed Kerry's foot, and tried to pull him out of the ring. However, he ended up pulling off Kerry's boot with the prosthetic foot attached.|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	yes its true. like the person posted above|`|AA12059944	maybe it was Kevin<br>  and thats why he didn't wrestle for that long

But, I'm biased, I'm a Cards fan!|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	The Twins have a good shot, as they have the three "top" players in the league right now.  Santana won yet another Cy Young and is returning healthy with a solid, slightly more experienced rotation, Mauer and Morneau can only get better, Cuddyer has one of the best arms in the league and has gotten better every year, they had arguably the best bullpen, and lost nobody, and they have a lot of good young talent developing and coming through in the clutch, however I have to say the tigers are the better choice.  They have another key player in Shef, and they have an amazing pitching staff.  Its a sad day when the tigers are not an easy win for us.|`|cc26f66f163149a72016057524193ec6aa	Bean Town! Will win it.

They have completely reworked the bullpen, which is what killed us last year, and Mike Hampton is coming back which will add a tremendous presence to our starting rotation.  If Chipper Jones can stay healthy, the Braves have a very good chance to bring the NL East title back to Atlanta and possibly represent the NL in the fall classic.  Let's go Braves!  Time to start a new streak!|`|tTqJL0dTaa	I'd love to see Detroit win it but I think it will be someone else.

Anch'io gioco da sette-otto anni e non mi stanco mai. Ovviamente abbonato al palasport anche!<br>  E' spettacolare, mozzafiato e sempre originale.<br>  In un secondo puoi vincere o perdere una partita e credo sia questo che lo rende cosi speciale. Non è mai troppo tardi per provare a vincerla. A differenza del calcio poi, non ci sono "difensori" e "attaccanti" ma i giocatori migliori sono quelli a "tutto tondo"...vedi MJ presenza fissa nel miglior quintetto difensivo di stagione....<br>  E poi quell'attimo che stai in aria prima di tirare....brrrrrrr....

gIxzeb0haa	Ya se acerca la época veraniega y empezamos a cuidar más nuestro cuerpo por lo peque?os excesos de la vida cotidiana... para tener unos abdominales bonitos y marcados recomiendo lo siguiente... los abdominales son músculos y por tanto por un sobreesfuerzo se cargan y pueden producir dolor, palabra esta que en ningún caso esta relacionada con un buen ejercicio. Al principio es mejor trabajarlos cada dos días para que puedan recuperarse. Unas series  (3x30 por ejemplo)variadas para cada grupo (superiores, inferiores, dorsales)antes de desayunar , para mi es lo más adecuado. Ya luego podras aunmentar según vaya aumentando tu resistencia y fuerza. Aunque no es un ejercicio que queme excesivas calorias, a esa hora tirara de las grasas. Para complementarlo lo más adecuado es buscar un agujero en nuestra agenda y practicar bicicleta, correr o natación, o sea, trabajo aeróbico para una eliminación más eficaz de los llamados michelines. Tambien no viene mal las cremas que venden para tonificar y evitar la acumulación excesiva de grasa despues de la ducha por ejmeplo (pero esto es un complemento y no una solución). Por último de manera general, evitar las comidas ricas en grasas saturadas como los bollos, las patatas fritas, bebidas carbonatadas, etc. Sobre el tema del agua, hay que beber agua, eso es obvio... pero si en un momento queremos mayor definición, de nuestros abdominales y mostrar nuestro resultado, es mejor no beber durante unas horas, asi la tripa no se hincha por el volumen de líquido ingerido y la piel esta más pegada al músculo debido a la deshidratación.<br>  buena suerte!!<br>  :)|`|3e2a723caaaf28cfee06d23aa76b65f9aa	mira despues de abdominales no es malo sentarse y  tampoco ase mal tomar agua al contrario dejame decirte recomendarte algo yo ase como unos meses tomaba como 1 gallon de agua al dia y en unos 2 meses el estomago como que se estava formando pero eso si deves de hacer muchas abdominales por ejemplo trata de acer 30 min al dia y veras los resultados en 2 meses|`|j3nsEFGfaa	Necesitas mas tiempo todo esto lleva tiempo, y no te marcaras de la noche a la ma?ana. lo del agua no se la verdad para que te miento nesesitas un entrenador. suerte y pues espero que tengas losresultados que esperabas.|`|jm6bt1slaa	Si quieres que se te marque, bajale a las grasas...  y si te puedes sentar al terminar de hacer ejercicio.... pero espera un poco para tomar agua|`|IeiAJCR1aa	Después de que hagas los abdominales si te puedes sentar y beber un poco de agua, pero para que se te marque debes de variar tus ejercicios de abdominales así como ir a correr y andar un bicicleta para que quemes un poco mas de grasa. también debes de tener una dieta mejor sin muchas grasas.|`|YmaLZc59aa	De que se puede se puede may!

If you do that you might be able to squeeze through but like the other guy said. If two people are on you that means that one of your guys is more than likely unblocked so he can get to the QB. Its team work.

But I also do know that when I stepped away to gather myself, it was also great.  It gave me time to enjoy life and do other things that basketball seemed to have consumed.  I do remember a great player name Michael Jordan who stepped away and enjoyed his time off the game.  My advise is that if you truly don't have 100% interest, stay away.  Then you will realize if you want to go back to it later, or perhaps in the  process of staying away you will find other things in life that interest you.|`|6816b581eec75bce28b7fe1e91701af1aa	i would 4 it again i mean its a real good sport n if ur good at it y not|`|71784331881c2d1c92e5b52ff44afddbaa	i would say if u want to quit quit dont listen to any of these losers on yahoo|`|AA11309657	if your good and tall, try out, especially if its highschool b-ball gets better by the years. best year in highschool is varsity so go for that, or just go to make the team in college, and try to go pro. hell its one of the most fast paced games ever how can you lose interest, just keep goin|`|a53d67070eb3182cca00ad4a43784a56aa	Give it one last shot,but give your best shot|`|c92ec4c2168e075f3e3fc505c5a03c1daa	If you aren't really into the sport like you were, then I wouldn't play.

d636af17b423f97b3c69182c7f8edb86aa	No i think Jeter is one of the most overated sports players he is surrounded with a team that should win the world series every year with players like A-Rod, Johny Damon, Hideki Mautsui,  Jason Giambi, Mariona Rivera, Jorge Posade, Robenson cano. He's a good player but if you put albert pujols and jeter on the same team they would neither win the mvp. I think Mounraea had a decent team and he led them to win a divisoin title in a hard divsion one team White Sox had one the ws 2 years before that then the tigers were the runner up to the cardnailds this year so that was a hard division and i don't thinked he deseved it necciserely but u can make a case for him|`|3f67bc27138586baa07f230b707ab971aa	Quick!

He is such a great player.|`|AA10153025	I completely agree with you.   His body of work (especially in the clutch) far outweighs what Mornea did.<br>  <br>  I think the only reason why Mornea got it was because the sportswriters feel that a catcher who wins the batting title is very difficult thing to do.  They feel that playing a catcher (being on your knees all the time) is the more difficult to play than shortstop.<br>  <br>  Look at Mike Piazza, he is the all-time home run hitter for that position.  He only around 400 home runs.  This is not even it the top 25 of all-time home run hitters.<br>  <br>  If I had to compare this to something-I would compare it to college football.  How does a team that goes undefeated not be considered #1?  That's because of "strength of schedule".<br>  <br>  In the case of Jeter v Mornea-it is "strength of position".|`|AA11216016	Derek Jeter definitely deserved that award, he is the greatest baseball player in the game, defensive and offensive|`|22e6ac960cadbb8d9dc11100f146cfc1aa	Even though I'm a red sox fan, I would agree with you.

Not only could the Texans had Young they could of had Bush. They didn't draft very well. Though i am not saying that Mario Williams isn't bad. David Carr will go to a teamin need of a quarterback. Teams such as Tampa Bay, Minnisota, and Oakland. Those teams are in need of that position. They could trade for a draft pick for next year. Not only they will have a good draft without the Carr draft trade but they will have a good draft because they are really bad. Then they could go for a quarterback like Troy Smith and maybe a running back.|`|832483ed0e447d0d1cefff503a116c0eaa	We can only hope.|`|f75e0029a67edaad4b5c6819c6328ae3aa	David Carr is not that bad of a QB, he is completing nearly 70% of his passes this year, which is unheard of in today's NFL. He has no offensive line, no running game, and no defense. With no running game and no defense you are forced to pass all the time. When you are forced to pass, defenses can plan against it and thus stop it all the time. When you have no offensive line, you cant pass, hence why David Carr is struggling. He will end up like Tim Couch did in Cleveland, a good QB screwed by his system.|`|59ce2dc3214b106a96f9456664470e00aa	He'll probably get traded to or acquired by the Vikings, then we'll get to grumble about him for awhile.  >:(<br>  <br>  We need QB help, but not *that* badly...|`|60efabbd6210b98c9b66dacfa77ad211aa	hey, carr showed life. but his o line blocks good for him. I say ditch him and get Brady Quinn in the draft|`|6f83ea481c797dd557e3047ab0baf727aa	I think they screwed up. I'm from Houston and a somewhat Texans fan. I was at the Texans-Titans game last weekend and saw the warm welcome to Vince Young. I am also an Aggie, and to have respect for a Longhorn (such as Vince Young) goes to show that he is on track to be and will be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. I think we should get Kevin Kolb from Houston. I'm not real big on Brady Quinn...|`|8e52783da3a3c964eef3a0058c229facaa	No,  Carr isn't the problem.  Its their offensive line.  I think the Texans hold the record last season for most times a QB is sacked.   If you are getting sacked that much you aren't going to be able to do your job.    ITs a 22 man team not a one man team.  I like Carr......GIve him a chance.....Kubiak is going to turn that team around....<br>  <br>  Im glad the Texans didn't get Reggie Bush.....N.O. needs him more.......|`|bca2eab3a6194f7a0acb8486eb1c7efaaa	Houston is stupid for not getting Vince Young or Reggie Bush but they could have a chance of getting Brady Quinn if Oakland or Detroit don't get him|`|AA10399154	David Carr is a good quaterback, but when your offensive line can't block for you than he's no good......also he had a new coach and had to adjsut to things....|`|bc2b59b7c267004f3cc309b8048b3f95aa	no, i think they are gonna draft  a QB troy smith 1 st round and a halfback 2nd round gary wolf

Green Bay was one of the most feared teams in the early days of the NFL.  Today, they are an average squad at best.  The Patriots used to be the whipping boys of the NFL, and now they are consistently in the running for playoffs each year.  San Diego has only recently become a strong team.  Heck, even the Saints had a few glory years in the late 80's/early 90's, only to fall to the wayside until this season.  Tampa Bay, Carolina, and even Cleveland have had their heyday, eventually I'm sure that Detroit, Arizona, and Oakland will be on top soon enough.|`|1f61355aaa0421c806cd650cb70bf57faa	it is possible. They all used to be good teams at one point.|`|c81ee0a6ae7479caec67ca84c573210baa	The Raiders were nice at one point in history.  The Lions will NEVER, EVER, EVER, be good.

jSo7Hy7Haa	Dog Fighting is one of the most barbaric 'sports' in existence today. Although illegal in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, the people who fight Pits operate underground, making them very difficult to catch and successfully prosecute. The people involved in animal fighting operate in very closed circles, and the fights themselves are held in remote and secret locations.??What is Dog Fighting??Dog fighting is seen as those involved as a 'sport'. It is in reality a vile 'contest' where two dogs (who have been bred, conditioned and trained to fight) are put into a pit to fight each other for the entertainment and gambling pleasure of the spectators. The fights usually last about an hour, but can last longer than two hours. The 'match' ends when one of the dogs either will not or cannot carry on.??Animal Cruelty?The injuries sustained by the dogs involved in fighting are severe and frequently fatal. These dogs are extremely powerful and are capable of doing serious damage to each other. The people who fight these dogs cannot take the dogs to a regular vet for fear of exposure to the law, so they generally 'medically treat' the dogs themselves, with little to no knowledge of veterinary medicine. As a result, these dogs frequently die of blood loss, shock, dehydration, exhaustion and infection.??If a dog loses a match, the owner of the 'losing dog' frequently kills the dog... and not by humane methods. The dogs who lose matches are often left to die of their injuries, are shot or even electrocuted. The owners do this out of anger because the dog has embarrassed them by losing, or has cost them a lot of money, or to keep the fighting dog bloodlines 'pure' by removing that losing dog from the gene-pool.??Some owners also train their dogs for fights by using smaller animals as bait (cats, rabbits, small dogs). These animals are usually pets that have been stolen for this use, or acquired through the 'free to good home' ads.??State Laws??Although dog fighting is illegal everywhere in the US, dog fighting laws differ by state in the ways that they impact the perpetrators. In states that do not ban keeping or selling fighting dogs, law enforcement must actually catch the offenders in the act of fighting the dogs to be able to successfully prosecute. It is extremely difficult to infiltrate animal fighting circles, though people who fight animals are easily identified by the condition of their dogs, the training equipment and drug paraphernalia they possess. <br>  A Community Problem?Many people are either unaware or turn a blind eye to obvious signs of dog fighting in their community. They shouldn't. Dog Fighting is a community problem for many reasons, including:??Dog fighters are often involved in the sale and possession of drugs, as well as illegal weapons. The weapons are present due to the large amount of cash present for betting upon the matches. ?Dog fighters and spectators have a history of violent and criminal behavior towards people. ?Dog fighting is another entertainment activity for gangs. ?It is not uncommon for dog fighters or spectators to involve their children in dog fighting. Research shows that young children who view this type of violence have a greater acceptance of aggressive attitudes and behavior. These children are taught to believe that it's ok to inflict the cruelties they observe and that dog fighting is an acceptable practice. ?The dogs that are used for fighting have been selectively bred for animal aggression. Their presence in the community increases the risk of attacks on other animals and also people. ?What can I do to help??For more information, a copy of your state's statute, or for tips on how to make your state's law more effective, you can contact the HSUS Government Affairs Section at 202-452-1100 or email legislation@hsus.org ?If you live in a state where dog fighting is still only a misdemeanor, please write to your state legislators and urge them to make it a felony. ?You are also encouraged to write letters to the media to increase public awareness of the dangers of dog fighting and to law enforcement officials to urge them to take the issue seriously. You can find a sample letter here. You can also display the HSUS dog fighting poster in your community. ?If you suspect that dog fighting is going on in your neighborhood, alert your local law enforcement agency.?Source(s):?<a href="http://www.pitbullrescuesandiego.com/lea..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pitbullrescuesandiego.com/lea...</a>|`|9JvGHSliaa	Are you really sure you want to know?<br>  <br>  Disregard once you have heard enough:<br>  <br>  They starve the dogs so they will be 'hungry' for the fight<br>  They drug the dogs with steroids for body strength and other drugs to make them more aggressive<br>  They hang the dogs by their neck or head for long periods of time to make their jaws stronger<br>  They put them in a ring with another deadly animal and make it fight that other dog<br>  They steal pets from neighborhoods and get them from 'free to a good home' ads and use these pets as what they call 'bait' animals--Just before a 'fight' they throw the pet into the cage with the starved pit bull to give him a taste of blood, the pet is torn to shreds in short order<br>  Some of the injured pit bulls and sometimes again the stolen pets are hung by their back legs and muzzled, then they turn the fighting dogs lose and let them attack the helpless dog until he either dies from blood loss, physical wounds, or shock<br>  If a dog does not perform well, (some will not fight even after being starved, drugged, and tortured) they execute the dogs by sadistic methods. With the BAD NEWZ Kennels they were said to <br>  Wet dogs down and then stick a live electrical wire up their behinds<br>  Slamming them to the ground until they are dead<br>  Shooting<br>  Hanging and if they survived that they submerged their heads in 5 gallon buckets of water and finished them off<br>  <br>  These are the methods we have HEARD about, I am sure there are probably more--<br>  <br>  Bloodsport organizations such as this have effectly ruined the reputation of pit bulls. They are now hated and vilified across the country. Many areas are considering banning anyone from owning a pit bull. If they are actually eliminated as a dog breed, the sadistic demented dogfighters will move on to another breed, and ruin that one--<br>  <br>  Below you can click the links to find out more about how these dogs suffer, and gain some information about pit bulls.

I feel that Randy and Ocho are both top 3 WRs (along with TO) and therefore I'd say to do it if you want to because it is a fair trade (although I will admit Minn defense has been very good).|`|8tEvmSpWaa	thats liek trading ana apple for an apple|`|PC09qTjsaa	I'd say keep Moss cause he's been blowing up over 100 yards and 2 touchdowns each week and has helped me cap some wins. PLus Minnesota's defense is 100 times better than the JAX D. So even if you break even on the trade with moss and chad you'll make more points with the Viking's D.

XXFVtGBQaa	werder oder schalke.<br>  stuttgart traue ich nicht viel zu. die sind so eingebrochen, die werden da nicht so schnell herauskommen. das erinnert mich stark an den hsv von letzter saison. die sind auch erst wieder aus dem keller gekommen als dolli gegangen ist. obwohl doll nicht wirklich was mit der misere zu tun hatte.<br>  schalke hat den ersten schritt gemacht mit dem sieg gegen rosenberg trondheim.<br>  und werder wird es auch packen. in letzter sekunde, da bin ich mri ziemlich sicher. und wenn sie das nicht in der cl packen dann kommen sie auf jeden fall noch auf den 3. platz und blühen dann im uefa cup auf!!!|`|00199cc95d0e31d96533ea07f8e6d7d1aa	über den 3.platz wird keiner kommen.<br>  Ist halt so wenn bayern nicht dabei ist.|`|bed4449ef7f9e6835ea88b2a22d83606aa	Stuttgart habe ich bereits abgeschrieben, was die Champions League betrifft - bis die aus ihrem Tief raus sind, ist die Vorrunde bereits vorbei und Stuttgart drau?en. In der Liga laufen sie gefahr, schon früh den Anschluss an die Spitzengruppe zu verlieren. Aber wenn wir mal ehrlich sind - so viel ist in der Liga nicht passiert und wer wenn nicht Stuttgart wei?, wie wertvoll eine gute Rückrunde ist! Also abwarten.<br>  <br>  Schalke hat im Moment fast alles richtig gemacht - in der CL sind sie meiner Meinung nach fast im Soll, auch wenn es gegen Valencia zu Hause gerne auch einen Punkt geben darf. In der Liga ist das 0:2 sicher ein Rückschlag, aber Karlsruhe musst du in dem Lauf erstmal schlagen! Trotzdem muss, wer Meister werden will, unabh?ngig davon natürlich einen Aufsteiger schlagen, keine Frage.<br>  <br>  Werder hat eine durchwachsene Saison bislang gespielt - und ist trotzdem Dritter. Spricht entweder für Bremen oder gegen die Qualit?t der Bundesliga. Wie auch immer - man muss Werder ein Kompliment machen, dass sie da stehen, so sie jetzt stehen! Was die Champions League betrifft, so war das bislang eine einzige Entt?uschung! Mit etwas Cleverness w?re gegen Real mindestens 1 Punkt drin gewesen und gegen Pir?us hat man in der 2. Halbzeit wie unter Morphium gespielt. Sollte man allerdings die beiden Spiele gegen Lazio gewinnen, ist wieder alles drin. Tippe trotz allem darauf, dass Schalke und Stuttgart rausfliegen, Werder noch weiter kommt!|`|nAuGgYkgaa	Alle drei überleben die Gruppenphase nicht.

Zur Zeit sind wir sicher die schlechteste Mannschaft, aber es muss ja auch mal wieder ne Wende kommen. Bis zum n?chsten CL Spiel sind Delpierre (der wichtigste), Hitze und da Silva wieder da. Leider fehlt dann Boka, aber den k?nnen wir mit Farnerud ersetzen und mit Beck. Nur Delpierre ist unersetzlich und wenn er wieder da ist, glaube ich an die Wende. Die Hoffnung stirbt zuletzt. Und noch sind wir nicht so schlecht wie 2001, also auf gehts. An Werder glaube ich weniger, denn wer gegen Pir?us verliert, kann ned weit kommen. Sorry und nun wieder Daumen runter für mich, weil ich an 2 AussenseiterVereine glaube und nicht an Werder. Aber ich stehe trotzdem zu meinem VfB :) Und im Gegensatz zu Werder stehen wir in der CL wenigstens auf Platz 3, also UEFA-Cup Platz :)|`|IRJaJD54aa	Stuttgart wird am weitesten kommen!|`|QyLGFR2paa	naja ich sage mal werder, stuttgart ist grade in einem tief und schalke eigentlich auch...|`|c4d63e47f7ca5923cf3624f5861c516caa	Ich denke das werder am weistesten kommt, w?re sch?n wenn sie wenigstens den 3 platz schaffen um im uefa cup zu spielen|`|b6ef076245b5f5d317f23164e05e0450aa	stuttgart!!!<br>  <br>  die hoffnung stirbt zuletzt!|`|SsS0hdm5aa	Die haben es alle 3 sehr schwer , man hats am WE gesehen......die doppel belastung ist nicht so einfach zu bew?ltigen.....TH

ROyzQrCMaa	I would start D,Ward hes playing green bay and he has to prove if he's for real or not and the giants are going to give him that chance look for him to have a big game maybe the game of his career I think this kids for real hes young, strong, fast, healthy, and good at catching the ball out of the back field congrats on getting Ward I am starting him this week over Cedric Benson anyway I am glad I am not facing your team so Good Luck this week stay away from Taylor this week he got banged up last week and Gerrard stinks lol my second choice of your four would be Berrian he has the potential for a big game as well. again Good luck and go Ward by the way I am a cheese head green bay all the way so for me to pick Ward should tell you somthing|`|qk1cPg44aa	taylor-spliting carries so no**d.ward-never herd of him so no**b.jackson-don't trust em so no**b.berrian-the only one left so yeah**|`|Kda2Rt3raa	I never like starting WRs in flex unless needed becuase RBs always get more points.

JwEbsQskaa	There's no doubt that you have a great vertical leap. The best thing to do to increase it is to follow these 8 steps:<br>  <br>  <br>  1<br>  Step One<br>  Begin every workout by warming up your muscles and then doing extensive leg stretches. Because you'll be building muscle fibers that are used for explosive activities such as jumping, stretching is of the utmost importance.<br>  2<br>  Step Two<br>  Jump rope for its excellent cardiovascular conditioning. This step should never be skipped, as it will be an important contributor to your results.<br>  3<br>  Step Three<br>  Sprint. This builds muscle, which will add to your jumping ability.<br>  4<br>  Step Four<br>  Run stairs on your toes. Start by running up a flight, one step at a time. Walk down and run back up, taking two steps at a time. Repeat as many times as you can manage.<br>  5<br>  Step Five<br>  Do sets of elevated jumps (see the next section).<br>  6<br>  Step Six<br>  Do sets of explosive jumps (see the third section).<br>  7<br>  Step Seven<br>  Do sets of double jumps (see the third section).<br>  8<br>  Step Eight<br>  Rest your legs at least two days a week. Results will come from sustaining the exercise program, not performing it aggressively for a few weeks and then slacking off.|`|73e125abf593afcb34c52d18acf1cf9baa	You have very short arms if your height is 5'7" and u can only reach 6'7". im 6'5" and i can reach 8'2". yea the other poster had it pretty much right.

S4wE3NByaa	I would say the Detroit Lions, but since they drafted Drew Stanton that looks less realistic but still plausible.  Also, after the Joey Harrington bust Miami could really use a reliable QB and even an aging McNabb could provide that for them.  Lastly, the Kansas City Chiefs could use a younger quarterback since Trent Green is over 35.  I believe any one of those 3 teams is definitely possible.|`|mcSiBz1taa	the only reasons the eagles would drop mcnabb after two seasons would be if he was injured and couldnt' play or if he started sucking. no team would want him if he was too injured to play and if you can't do decently in a west coast offense you're not gonna play better in another scheme. therefore mcnabb will not be playing for another team. if he did, it'd probably be the ravens.|`|aADpNGWVaa	it depends on who sucks when he gets cut|`|0d39043ddcd75e256281df6cfad68f74aa	i think he would be welcomed in baltimore. the raiders could get him as a mentor to jamarcus russell and he could fight 4 the starting job there as well

y7U9bKjBaa	3 by far.<br>  <br>  A martial art person may work hard, but WWE superstars are on the road almost every night to entertain fans around the world.|`|MAZBBJp4aa	wwe wrestler.|`|QLhuYWmxaa	i choose number 2. that would be totally kewl. how much is the bet?|`|UPlCAaNQaa	wwe wrestling because in street cars all u see is that the cars are going around and stuff like that u kno what i mean and the second nah it dont even sound interesting not to offened anybody and number 3 is the best cuz u kno ppl are getting beat up and there are belts and stuff and everyday there is some new stuff and new ppl so u kno from my point of view i would choose wrestling.|`|W9JLeKPVaa	i choose a wwe wreastler because they works their asses off!|`|sLVApZ61aa	I Choose a WWE wrestler who knows japanes ways and martial arts and has a nice @$$ street racer car....   <br>   That would be the coolest person EVER!!!!|`|GMzQZXavaa	3|`|yQmDb3RKaa	Most of us on this section would property say  the wwe wrestler ,because that's why we are here, to talk and support  wrestling.....so i will go with ............................a wwe wrestler.............
4BdXBjwQaa	wear it as much as you can.. just, almost as an instinct to just randomly curve the bill on your own, i do it all the time during my baseball games, and it gets broken in easily.. but wearing it helps|`|aabkRFNbaa	Soak it in the shower with as much water as you can stand; take it and fold it over to peak it then use mom's clothespins to hold it in position. Let it air dry naturally. Open it up and when it's dry, spray starch on it and iron it in. You'll have the best peak on the cap you've ever had. {Former professional baseball umpire.....I used this technique when I was in the game}.
9df324ecd5f192f2743d59d73688649caa	I would not make the trade unless his first pick would be able to get you Steven Jackson, Larry Johnson, Frank Gore or Shaun Alexander at a minimum. (The other owners would be crazy to give up the before mentioned in a keeper league.) <br>  <br>  If his pick is at the mid to end of the first round then you will go from stud RB to Reggie Bush and at best a second tier, possibly third tier RB's, especially in a keeper league.<br>  <br>  LT is a certified stud fantasy player. Only injury could slow him down. He is more of a lock to have an outstanding year due to Norv Turner's excellent track record with RB. (Turner was the Off coordinator when LT came into the league.) <br>  <br>  Turner's recent track record with RB's is great with Lamont Jordan in 2005 (Jordan has dropped to a 3rd or 4th tier RB when Turner was fired in 2006. Aaron Brooks at QB also doesn't help) and Frank Gore burst onto the scene last year.<br>  <br>  McNabb is solid point getter but only when he is healthy and he has finished a full year since 2004. Reggie Bush should have a good year, but he is a clear cut second tier RB who could emerge as a stud by year's end. You don't know what you will get with his pick.<br>  <br>  Don't do the trade and ride the LT express to the championship.|`|41a325ac3c7e9a44f30b472dfc86b4beaa	if it's a PPR league, you'd have a gold mine in Reggie Bush<br>  <br>  <br>  Myself, I'd pull the trigger in my league if somebody offered that, but I'd try and get somebody other than McNabb....he's still iffy after the injury and he's still injury prone<br>  and I can't see any problems with having Bulger as your starting QB every week.....the guy's a stud|`|f2d2290c573b9c118fe2a1bae3882f29aa	I wouldn't do it. LT is the best fasntasy player out there and still has plenty of good years left. Adding Bush would be nice and so would McNabb, but they are not worth what LT is worth. McNabb will most likely get hurt and Bush is still splitting carries. Plus, it is PPR, and that is where Bush gets most of his points. Another pick isn't going to get you a player anywhere near as good as LT. I would not do that trade.|`|rBD8hqC1aa	The first round pick you mention, assuming 12 league players multiplied by 3 keepers, means at the earliest pick you'd be getting is #37.  Bulger will be starting over McNabb. So basically the trade is Bush for LT plus a 37th pick. I wouldn't do it.

There is this thing that lets you search for old questions, try it next time.|`|mv4dTrzlaa	yea he betrayed the lakers he should get traded|`|oW3TU7Kkaa	This is the problem I think when a star player feels that the rest of his team isn't "Championship contending."  But other than that, I don't really care about him because I don't like the Lakers.|`|piEeeQbtaa	well its cuz he has all that raw power but i guess he feels that no matter what he does, the Lakers don't win<br>  and thats cuz they have a crappy team<br>  thats why he wanted to leave|`|cf1f3a688ad35b5901920f183df37cf0aa	First of all its KOBE not KOBY and he's a player whos untradeable, and one of the best players all-time.

OR just hit a hard line drive between the outfielders (it'll keep rolling), you can usually beat out a 14/15 year-olds throw home.

kQRaJpQ0aa	I hate them.  I work in retail and kids are always speeding thru the store on them.  I've seen them fall and get hurt.  If I catch a kid rolling on them in the store I tell the to quit.  If I catch them again I tell them they have to go outside.  They are putting themselves and others in a dangerous situation.  I am a manager with a major retail store. Some stores have a sign on the front door that they are not allowed.  I would love to put up a sign but corporate won't let us.  I would not buy them for my children no matter how popular they are.|`|Ua5gRaTwaa	I think they're a rip off and lame if your interested in heelys you should try skateboarding|`|nwPEtFGvaa	Kind of annoying.
Y9KwBt4Yaa	yeah beckett or tuffstuff is the way to go. But its sometimes hard to get bookvalue for a card.|`|9gnGfpRoaa	check out the sports card magazines such as tuffstuff or beckett for the prices on cards or go to a card shop. get several quotes

What you need to do is keep practicing, try doing figure 8's between your legs, and do the "duck walk" if you know what that is. that should really help you.  good luck!|`|AA10107263	when u got a defender on u, then bring the ball back a little, do a head fake, and crossover low. you will break away from the fool and get a layup.|`|0ws6rQP6aa	First, you should get real.  It starts with working on your dribbling skills.  Don't think that you are going to be like Allen Iverson just yet.  As John Stockton did, practice dribbling whenever you have time.  It will take time before you can perfect the crossover.
I8aNQdgCaa	kerna dia menang cuma sebab nasib baik dan bukan kerna kebijaksanaannya.kan cuma beda gol aja mereka menang musim lalu|`|4r3Ijhjhaa	i think ! ya... menurut saya sih. kinerja kepelatihan capello itu sendiri yangf menyebabkan dia di pecat. dan seorang pelatih itu selain harus bisa mengatur taktik dalam bermain juga harus bisa membuat para pemainnya itu merasa senang di latih oleh dia, bukannya brantem dengan pemain karna ke egoisannya !! walaupun mantan pelatih As-roma itu dapat memberikan gelar la-liga buat real madrid tapi kita lihat ketika awal musim real madrid ... tersungkur2... padahal dengan kualitas pemain yang top banget.. ! dan sang presiden tidak mau itu terulang kembali . makanya capello di pecat ..! coba deh liat tim2 yang lain yang sudah melalkukan perombakan2 utuk timnya ... ! nah presiden madrid pun melihat titik kelamahan real madrid pada musim lalu itu brada dalm seorang pelatihnya...! coba deh liat REAL MADRID yang sekarang, permainannya berbeda banget dengan musim yang lalu ... ya... salah satunya karna pelatihnya yang cerdas menggunakan taktik .. dan memilih pemain... ! so madrid sekarang memuncaki klasemen sementara .... . mungkin itu buktinya sobat ... mengapa capello di pecat...!!!!|`|3gTulDoAaa	Mungkin karena mereka sudah tidak cocok lagi ama kinerja kepelatihan Don Fabio|`|4r7Nf8Ktaa	karena pihak management aja yang bodoh. aset kok di jual...|`|6ymav3bzaa	Karena taktik gaya permainan Capello konservatif (permainannya kurang menyerang) dan itu bertolak belakang dengan keinginan presiden Real Madrid yang ingin agar taktik permainan timnya menyerang dan indah.Jadi keinginan mereka bertolak belakang dan Capello dipecat dan diganti sama Schuster.|`|wRbwueBWaa	mungkin capello rese' ?? atau dia gak bisa bikin pemainnya jadi bintang ?? nah loh gak nyambung...<br>  mungkin presidennya gak puas cuma ngedapetin piala liga aj... dia mau piala yang lain... piala liga champion, piala bang yos, piala AFC... halah...sotoy... lagian suka2 presidennya mo mecat sapa... wong dia punya kedudukan dan uang... hari gini ??!!! gak munafiklah... kedudukan dan uang bisa merubah segalanya... hoho...

If one of them is going up against a really good defense, don't start them. However, if it's a defense as bad as the Texans', then start that player. Bottom line: check the defense each quarterback is up against, then compare the defenses to see which one is better; the QB playing against the worst d should start.
bbblad63aa	tough call. I think the Dallas D is alot tougher then they showed this week. I would do with Jackson .

zTixXG4Jaa	I agree, unfortunately, UH is in the WAC conference and our strength of schedule isn't that great.  For Brennan to win the Heisman, he's going to have to go undefeated, put up big numbers, and hope that White, Slaton, Rice, and the Louiville QB screw up big time.  As for John L's response, that guy don't know ****!  Sure, Hawaii's offense is designed to put up big numbers, however, it takes a great QB to do it in an efficient manner.  If you think any QB can do it, look at UH's previous starting QB, Timmy Chang.  He broke the NCAA record for career passing yards, but I'll be the first to say that he wasn't that great.  He threw way to many interceptions and incompletions.  Look at the QB who replaced Brennan on Saturday.  He threw two interceptions in the first half.  Brennan has one interception in three games.  As for the Woodson fellow, he ain't gonna win ****!   Sure they play a lot touger opponents than Hawaii, but you forgot to mention they also play Florida Atlantic, Kent State, and Eastern Kentucky.  With the exception of LSU those other ranked teams are overrrated.  I bet you didn't even know that Florida refused to play Hawaii.  We proposed playing them in Florida, and they turned us down.  I guess they recognize the skills of Brennan.|`|Jr4j2Rcsaa	He dont deserve crap. He didnt play the other day and the backup even won big with that crap schedule they have. Andre Woodson is the best QB in the nation, what other good qb like that faces LSU, Florida, Arkansas, Tennesee, Louisville, and Georgia in the same season? Brennan aint crap and never will be. Hawaii will see what its all about come time to play Boise State and Washington, and these teams arent even all that great. Put LSU, USC, West Va, or Florida on their schedule and see how they do.|`|sk1kzURpaa	He'll be drafted early in the first round next year and will be in the Heisman runnings if he keeps putting up good numbers. And what's his prize? He'll get to QB the Falcons, or maybe the Dolphins.|`|1hQcoB8paa	I think he's the top QB in the country.  But our media ignores every team that doesn't play in a major conference.  Even if Hawaii goes unbeaten, they'll be left out in the cold come BCS time.  The system is rigged.

10302514907cc7c0aca4f1a0f05393b3aa	Start Derrick Ward, he runs hard and the GMEN usually don't abandon the run.  Also, he is the lone back and should get about 80-100 yards.  <br>  The only drawback, is that the GMEN have been bringing in Droughns for goal line carries, so it is a crap shoot in that regard.|`|PC09qTjsaa	If Carnell looks healthy before the game I'd start him. If not I'd say Derrick Ward before he starts splitting carries.|`|SeJ8eb3iaa	Derrick Ward i think is better, but Reuben Droughns steals his TD's so i'd have to say Carnell would be the better RB here.

Not a whole lot not to get|`|AA11074108	explain to me what the hell you are talking about|`|b38931832a49ba21d5c20524dbb5ac06aa	Simple, it was an azz-whippin'!!<br>  <br>  Actually, if you want it broken down to the basics, UCLA scored four touch-downs (7 points a touchdown for 28 total points) in the fourth quarter (the last 15 minutes of a 4 quarter/60 minute game) which is pretty good.  After a team scores, they kick-off to the other team.  That is what the article is talking about in the second paragraph.  Basically, Lawson (from Oregon State) received the kick-off three times and fumbled (dropped the ball so anyone can pick it up) three times.  That's pretty pathetic.<br>  <br>  They show Kahlil Bell's statistics for the game because he had a good game.  80 yards rushing is mediocre, but he had 49 receiving yards which makes a total of 129 yards which is pretty good.  Two touchdowns for one player is also impressive.<br>  <br>  Ben Olson threw for 220 yards.  When it said he was 14-for-25 it means that he passed (threw) the ball 25 total times in the game, but only 14 of those passes were caught.<br>  <br>  UCLA Bruins have a record of 4-1, 3-0 in the Pac-10 meaning that they've lost only one total game in the season while they won 4 games.  The 3-0 in the Pac-10 means that they've played 3 games in the Pac-10 (which is a conference...basically, 10 teams play in this one conference).  That's a wee bit more confusing, but the important thing is they are 4-1.<br>  <br>  Jeeze, I read over that and it seems more confusing than the article itself.  Hope it helps.|`|wNg60fPPaa	explain what? i dont get it like the score or what?

As a guy, I refuse to comment on the looks hotness of other men, although I will happily point out ugly.    In terms of the latter, that's debatable, only one QB just won the Superbowl although he is much maligned and doesn't produce impressive "hot" stats. Drew Brees has incredible talent and just completed the second highest yards total season ever recorded. In terms of starting QB's who played most of the season, Philip Rivers ranked number 1 followed by Chad Pennington, then Warner, then Brees.

DpfJfK6Baa	I don't remember it being played, but I remember I had a programme from one of the games.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	The Sheriff of London Charity Shield was an English football competition played once a year between the best amateur and best professional side in England.    The first game was played on March 19, 1898, after being devised by Sir Thomas Dewar. Proceeds from the annual game were distributed to hospitals and charities.    The competition was short-lived due, in part, to the dominance of the professional sides, and also to a rift in the Football Association which saw the creation of the Amateur Football Association. The shield was ceased in 1907 - although the charitable spirit of the trophy was to continue on in the Charity Shield; it was twice resurrected since, once in the 1930s and the other in the 1960s.    The Shield itself, commissioned by Dewar, was over six feet high - the largest trophy to be competed for in the history of football. In the 1980s the trophy was put up for auction and sold for 26,000 to a private American owner. Its current whereabouts are unknown.|`|i5jpDCVqaa	Yes it was an awsome event.

That's a big risk on the Yankees....no way will they sign Manny, it just doesn't make any sense.    Disclaimer: Note to Yankees and Mets fans...you have wanted every big name free agent on the market so far...even some Yankee fans asking for Abreu to get signed again.

Be careful what you request.|`|4cJuKxJbaa	Why dont you people understand that he CANT go to the Yankees! They have reached there maximum number of "Type A" free agents.

I didnt hear this piece of news. Wow wasnt aware the ban had been lifted. Even with this new bit of news I cant see the Yankees signing him. What would they do with Matsui?

Gva0qq3Yaa	Depending on zone press or man you have two versions of attack.     Man press -- get the ball inbounds and to a guard with a clear out to allow a full backcourt to work with to get the ball across.    Zone press -- If it has a point man on the thrower then you attack wing center opposite wing.  2 defenders at the elbows attack the middle first.  Both allow you to catch the defense in slides and create open space.    Plus, don't panic.    But your coach already told you that didn't he?|`|xDDNCKvlaa	Try trapping them in the corner. You have two defenders on them as well as being able to use the sideline as a third defender. And by the way, I'm a Carolina fan but Ben McCauley didn't mean to foul Mike Copeland as hard as he did. He was trying to make a play on the ball.|`|oPWXfsa2aa	dude you probably want to try a standard spread press break. have the 4 inbound the ball with the 1 2 5 and 3 near midcourt in that order. The 1 and 2 should run forward and then split and try to get them the ball. if that doesnt work, the 5 and 3 are near mid court. the 5 turns around and screens for the 3. the 3 runs forward and gets the ball. if he can, he should try to turn around and bring the ball up. if they trap him, look right back at the 4. the 4 should have come a little farther up so the 3 can just swing him the ball.
KqfTXGSUaa	Basketball is a TEAM sport. Being a team player is more important than individual stats. A lot of a team's losses are due to individual players who are only concerned with their own performance and don't play as part of the team.

The people cannot be effectively controlled if they are armed. <br>  <br>  An armed population could potentially resist the will of the government, like in the Revolution.... by disarming people, they can be more effectively kept under government control. <br>  <br>  Use example as to "how effective" gun control is, citing countries like the USSR as "good examples, and a model we should strive to be like". <br>  <br>  Make it sound as tyrannical as possible.|`|xboDUtI2aa	"Gun control" doesn't have to be a bad thing.  Banning guns because paranoid soccer moms think they're evil is one form of "gun control", but so is prohibiting violent felons and small children from buying them.  You have to define what appropriate "gun control" means to you, and argue your points from that perspective.  Should a six-year old be prohibited from buying a full-auto firearm?  Definitely.  Should all semi-auto firearms be banned because some psycho idiot decided to shoot up a school with one?  No.  Taken from this perspective of responsibility and common sense there is no way you can lose your debate.  What's the other guy going to say, that yes six-year old kids should have machine guns?|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	The problem with gun control is this:  Gun control as proposed by anti-gun politicians has nothing to do with keeping guns out of the hands of criminals.  It has all to do with CRIMINALIZING GUN OWNERSHIP.  When guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns.  How then shall we protect ourselves from those with murderous intent?  The police 80% to 90% of the time react to crime rather than prevent it.  This leaves a hapless public waiting for the police to respond.<br>  <br>  Consider also that an unarmed population is easier to control.  Police State anyone?<br>  <br>  That's what's wrong with gun control.<br>  <br>  H<br>  |`|gN56VYGDaa	There is a thin line between gun control and a total ban.  From what I've heard, Obama is against guns, he wants to ban most guns from being sold, he wants to raise the tax on ammunition by over 500%.  He basically wants to change the 2nd Amendment, and anybody who stands in his way will be picked up and placed aside.<br>  <br>  He also wants to let a lot of convicted felons have their right-to-carry privileges.|`|FVMcBP2Qaa	I think your best answer here is from DK.  I do not agree with the suggestions he/she offered, but they represent some of the foundational arguments of the 'anti-gun' group.  <br>  <br>  It is interesting, though, that his/her opening statement was nullified by the suggestions in the end.  It was stated that the second amendment was added to provide security for the people, against any foreign or domestic threat, but it was later suggested that semi-autos, handguns, and other 'non-hunting' firearms be fitted with de-activators, only allowing them to be operated at a range.  How likely is it that one would be attacked at a shooting range?<br>  <br>  The simple fact of the matter is this: The second amendment was, indeed, provided for the security of the citizens of this nation.  There is no solid evidence to suggest that banning firearms reduces violent crime rates, but some slight evidence that a 'right to carry' law reduces it.  In theory, reasonable restrictions are, in fact, reasonable.  However, only those who are reasonable enough to obey the law would follow those restrictions, putting themselves in danger of those who do not follow the law. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your presentation.  |`|VEoG1VCsaa	Don't worry about your assignment!  Debating against your own viewpoint will strengthen your beliefs.<br>  <br>  Gun control is not good, and I don't think anyone here will legitimately agree that it is.<br>  <br>  For the sake of your argument, the following unsubstantiated facts are usually spewed out by the anti-gun crowd:  leading cause of death for kids, police will handle our problems and keep us safe, guns only lead to more violence in a criminal encounter, we have evolved past the need to defend ourselves, and guns will be kept out of the hands of criminals.  None of these can be proven to be accurate, but that is the information out there.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|fKeJfgFoaa	You should not argue against your principles, it's bad.|`|19pANvMBaa	Gun Control means using both hands.  |`|YrxLbfiIaa	Only communist believe in gun control.....<br>  <br>  History has shown that tyrants seize firearms from the population before they inplement a communist / totalitarian state.....<br>  <br>  Obama is no different.....

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	No because Vince refuses to acknowledge TNA as his nearest competitor and rival, which is why WWE banned the Superstars and Divas from visiting the TNA Impact Zone during last year's Wrestlemania 24.There's no chance of Vince giving his rivals any publicity or tv time in an inter-promotional feud.Besides the WWE Invasion angle back in 2001 was regarded as a creative failure.|`|lCzBONU1aa	Vince did copromote with ECW when they were in a ratings war with WCW.

I think the situation right now is great. WWE and TNA respect each other, they didn't like each other:), but there is a certain respect, it's a good way of competing in who has the better programm. What would happen if TNA Impact would air on monday or friday nights. Vince has learnt from old mistakes, and he would destroy TNA one way or another. TNA is too young to have an serious war with the WWE, Vince has the experiences with WcW, in the end he would destroy the TNA, and the fans would lose a great alternative to watch. So please no more wars.|`|1ead85402698581b0818d3b4314aeaf9aa	If TNA goes out of business and Vince buys it, but a bunch of TNA guys would balk at the idea of working with Vince and vice versa.

p6AZS94Daa	Should have been a 15yd penalty, on the kick-off|`|RvXEXb5Yaa	it would be a 15 yard penalty. They never called a penalty on that so they kicked it off the orignal spot as always. If the penalty was called then the cardinals can choose to have 15 yards added on to the return. So actually since the cardinals got the ball on the 25 yard line starting they would have it at the 40 actually. So they would have 29 seconds to go 60 yards and with the cardinals it  is preety possible. Instead of having to go 75 they would need 60 only. Also there was a penalty before the supposibly fumble and it wasnt called. So they would have to then actually go only like 10 yards at the point of the penalty. So 10 yards to go and 5 second left. looks like enough time for me to get a touchdown and wint he game.|`|s9Pwnb87aa	Should have been a 15 yard unsportsmen like conduct penalty for using the ball as a prop.

If the refs didn't see it, it makes me think he didn't do in the end zone right after the touch down and maybe did it on the side line around his teammates.     As far as I know, there is no rule saying that after one scores a touchdown, one can never shake a football, so I don't know what the big deal is.|`|utJYCCvaaa	orangeblood why you keep saying 45-35 i swear the game was 27-23

Lots to worry about, but it's only 1 game so will see how they respond in the next 5-6 games.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	A "Relapse?" Not quite sure what you mean by that.

cOPCNP7Laa	Its not really true:    I have to notice that it is an 83,000+ stadium and it's shared by TWO teams.    Inter fans, and take it from experience and observation, hardly crowd San Siro, but if it is the Derby it's ALWAYS full. Same with Inter-Juve or Inter-Roma.    Milan fans crowd San Siro WAY MORE than Inter fans. We had more fans watching Milan-Braga in UEFA than in Inter's CL games, even vs Werder Brema lol    But we (AC Milan) get a minimum of 50,000-60,000 people in AVERAGE games such as those vs Torino, Lecce, etc, and definitely fill up bigger games.    We would definitely fill up Old Trafford and most English stadiums of lower capacity.    But differentiate Inter fans and Milan fans.    For the record, Juve fans are the worst. They don't even fill out Juve's 25,000 capacity Olympic stadium for semi-decent opponent games (like derby with Torino, vs Sampdoria or Genoa, etc)    MJ yes and I evidently can read. Our AVERAGE season long was that. But regularly we get close to 60,000 in Serie A and we definitely fill it for derbies and big games. We had over 60,000 for the pre-season against Juve ALONE.

LnJjS8BRaa	98 - on a quick count.|`|26b727784ab6c6917ee0c334293b7446aa	The Chen style I know reliably that it has a total of three forms;<br>  <br>  The first (forgot what its called) "soft" form, which is most recognizable in its "slow motion" nature, the second "hard" Pao Chui (cannon fist) form, which ressembles Shaolin Kung Fu, and then finally the third small frame routine, the Chen small frame form was taught to Hao Wei Zheng, who created his own style called either the "Hao" or "Wu" style and don't ask me to explain how the Hao Wei Zheng style is also called the Wu style, something to do with him training under some dude surnamed "Wu" and because of lineage issues he had to call his style the "Wu" style.<br>  <br>  I believe it had something to do with Hao Wei Zheng having studied both under the Chen stylist who taught him the small frame, the third frame in the Chen style, and then later on under Yang Lu Chan, and then after that, Yang Lu Chan's student who was surnamed "Wu."  Because the Hao Wei Zheng style borrowed so much from the Wu style, it was known as the Wu style as well so there are actually TWO styles of Tai Chi called "The Wu Style."  Getting a headache yet?  To avoid confusion, lets just refer to Hao's style as the Hao style okay?<br>  <br>  The Hao style only has one form, and I think that the Chen style is unique among all of them to reliably have more than one form to study.  There is the first, slow form, taught to beginers, I believe it MAY be called the Chen large frame or "cotton fist" or "soft fist," the second intermediate form called the Pao Chui or "cannon fist," finally the most advanced one, the Chen small frame, taught by a Chen to Hao Wei Zheng who then created his own style known as the Hao Wei Zheng style.  Hao Wei Zheng then instructed master Sun Lu Tang in his style of Tai Chi Chuan.  Sun Lu Tang, was already proficient in Shaolin Chuan, Xing Yi Quan and Bagua Zhang, and combining those previous three influences, created the Sun style of Tai Chi which some people consider more an offshoot of the Hao Wei Zheng style than a style in its own right although, there are crucial differences.<br>  <br>  The Hao Wei Zheng style is most reliant on small circular motions, whereas the Sun Style of Tai Chi is heavily reliant on "spear hand" positions.  Whereas in the Hao Wei Zheng style you constantly move your hands in small circles, in the Sun style, you hold them perfectly still for long moments, as Sun was obsessed with the Daoist idea of "stillness" and felt that an advanced form of Tai Chi should have moments in which a person holds perfectly still, that, was likely the Xing Yi influence, which uses that "stillness" stuff a lot.<br>  <br>  There are persistent rumors (rumors, not facts) that the Yangs have kept hidden from the public the other 4 frames of their style, and that only the rudimentary large frame is taught to the public.  The more advanced frames of the Yang style involve leaping kicks, and foot stomps in other words, elements found in the more "traditional" and recognizable to the west as Wushu "hard" martial arts.  I think there is probably a basis in fact to these rumors, as Wushu tradition holds that a recognizable style of Kung Fu (or Wushu whatever you wanna call it) has to have a total of 5 frames.<br>  <br>  Shaolin Chuan, Hung Gar Chuan, Fujian Crane style, Monkey Kung Fu, the non-Shaolin Praying Mantis style, among other styles, almost all the external schools, have five 108 step routines to learn.  Trust me, just ONE 108 step routine is difficult enough, not to mention 5 of them.  It takes more than a little dedication and good study habits to learn all 5 frames of a given style, and considering the painstakingly slow nature of the internal styles, since most people would likely give up and quit anyway even if the Yangs chose to teach all 5 frames, in the end its a waste of time, the style suffers, so likely they don't bother.  In fact, in my opinion I don't even think master Yang Lu Chan passed down his knowledge to his sons at all; I know that masters of Kung Fu are so ruthlessly impartial, that if their own children do not qualify, they will not even instruct them.  Naturally they will take responsibility and blame themselves for not having been better parents, parents that raised a child to be able to do Kung Fu, but I know that masters will not hand down skills even to their own children if these do not have good character.<br>  <br>  That probably means that somewhere in China, the defacto "successor" to the true Yang style of Tai Chi, or likely successors as there is probably a small handful, is not a Yang.  As to how many styles there are, they are virtually endless now, however the 5 standard, recognized styles as being the core ones are, in order of age;<br>  <br>  1)  Chen<br>  2)  Yang<br>  3)  Wu<br>  4)  Hao<br>  5)  Sun<br>  <br>  Then there is also the legendary Wudang style, the one practiced by Shang Sang Feng that rumor holds, was taught to Yang Lu Chan's own teacher, and that the Yang style is in fact the Wudang style.  However I do not buy too much into that; to me the internal arts are
xgTpop6laa	si, te recomiendo mas las artes marciales orientales, la razon desde mi punto de vista es la parte espiritual que estas cargan, en el kikc boxin y el full contact y las que se parecen, si hay muchos golpes mucho ejercicio, como el box, pero el karate que el lo que practico, tiene algo que se les llama Katas, alli esta la parte espiritual, la parte donde se perfecciona el caracter, la parte que te hace formar una filosofia del guerrero, segun la tradicion oriental, un guerrero valiente es eficaz en el campo de batalla pero un guerrero sabio es mas eficas comandando guerreros valientes, y eso se logra cosechando la parte espiritual.

gaN6hbbGaa	I would say it depends on the aplication. If you are gonna be playing speedball and you will be running and gunning and going through a few thousand rounds quickly then yeah its good but isnt recomended with co2 which is the easiest accessable gas to use. as the above user said hpa is almost a must. On the contrary if you are gonna be woodsballing and plan on roughing up the gun and not putting a ton of paint through it i would say its not a greast begginer gun. I would recomend a tippmann a5 or 98 custom as they can take a lickin and keep on tickin and they are designed to take co2 or hpa.|`|RuJYupFWaa	Well, yes and no.      Yes, it's a good gun for beginners but not as simple as spyders or tippmanns.  As long as you read the manual though, you'll be fine.  A lot of newer players get an Ion as their first gun, don't read the manual, mess something up, then blame the gun.    And no, because it basically requires hpa/compressed air and not everyone can afford an hpa tank and/or they can't get hpa refills easily.  So take that into consideration.    If you still want an Ion but can't get hpa, check out the Vibe.  Same company and operates basically the same as an Ion but is designed to run on co2.  That may be a better fit as a beginner gun.

392fb9fe3924e0ea502b517efe20098daa	Have you been there?  What makes you think a large number of people will be fishing alongside you.  Alaska is vast.  Alaska is huge with a very very large number of quality fishing spots.  If you can't find a place all by your lonesome, you aren't trying very hard.  If you see a large number of people fishing together, it is for the TV or a certain spot (easy to get to) that has salmon running.  Still you can find many places to fish alone.  Alaska is no way overrated.  Don't pass judgement until you have been there.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	No, but I do believe Alaskans on Y/A are!...LOL!|`|uXWbOhDcaa	You need to be willing to hike away from them or pay a guide to get you some privacy..........It ain't overrated, it is awesome|`|EoPRTJr4aa	no it's everything you've heard and way way more.  I could tell you about fish stacked thick enough in a creek mouth that it would appear you could walk across on fish backs and seeing 4 types of salmon in view in the mass of fish laid out in front of you. it's pointless even fishing at a spot like that cuz you'll hook fish on every cast, you can't help it there are so many fish....... na it's all a hoax, don't bother going.|`|O9FojdEMaa	i've never had the opportunity to fish in Alaska or Canada.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	I've been a few times.  The fishing is outstanding.  I caught so many red salmon on my 6 weight fly rod, that I ruined two reels in one trip (granted they were cheap reels).  I've drug up halibut close to 100 pounds, my dad caught one 250.  The best experience, while fishing the Kenai for reds with my 6 weight, I latched onto one of those oversize kings.  He surfaced just to rub it in, then made a run, broke my rod, and my heart.  I wouldn't even venture a guess how big he was (the ones that get away are always bigger.)  The combat fishing does get old, but there's a reason that many people are fishing.  The other thing that sucks, is the fish come in waves.  Either there's no fish, or you couldn't cast without catching one.  The scenery is spectacular.  I think everyone should try it, at least once at some point in their life.
7uffHRdkaa	It depends on the Yankees willingness to put Swisher in CF. Damon's not going to play CF. He's got a terrible arm. The two most common positions Swisher played last season were 1B and CF. No one would like to put Swisher in CF, but it'd make the line-up stronger. It may be something they do even now and than, but the most likely scenario will either be to have a 4 way platoon of three guys, with Matsui, Swisher, Nady and Damon, which can help keep each fresh. Or Swisher or Nady will be traded. Matsui's injuries and salary, along with Damon's salary diminish their trade value. Plus, the Yankees need Damon at the top of the order. Expect Swisher to stay and Nady to be traded. Swisher's BA isn't really attractive, so Nady may be the better option to keep, but the Yankees probably wouldn't have traded for Swisher if they didn't have plans for him. Still though, they saw Nady play decent for them, but he's in a contract year and won't get them much back in a trade. I think the Mets may be interested in Nady though, because they can use a right-handed hitting corner OF, but aren't being wise enough to sign Manny.|`|Cho9EtSnaa	it depends he and xavier nady will be the right fielder they have to trade one of them   and they say that nady will most likly be the one to be traded BRO|`|iLktOl83aa	not unless or until some outfielder or texeira is injured.  it is possible that by mid summer he will play at least one day a week in rf, one in lf, one dhing, I think it more possible that he will be traded to braves, reds nationals.  A lot depends on if nady is traded or not.|`|zMvGnlMraa	I agree with what Tom M said exactly.  Im actually hoping the Yankees only signed Swisher just in case and now that they have Teixeira, Swisher is the one they will be looking to get rid of instead of Nady.  I think Nady is the type of player that understands the game and his role.  He is a great hitter who is not caught up with being the best, breaking records, the media, or anything besides just bettering his game and helping his team win.  I think Nady is an asset to this team and Yankees should try there best to keep him.  He reminds me of a Paul O Neill, Scott Brosius type of player.|`|Mxzz2my7aa	maybe at cf|`|iz5zDFxvaa	I doubt it unless the Yankees change their mind about having him start in CF or move Damon to CF and put Swisher in LF.

scMMpPciaa	I have always been taught...the longer it takes you to get to point B from point A the more calories you can burn when running. So slow it down because you are also causing better resistance by slowing the running down with will help with muscle tone.<br>  <br>  (just what I have always been taught, you may need to look this up for confirmation)|`|bc12b3e60b0bad75a0255fc7888e3b38aa	You should do both.  Alternate days.  The slower paced running helps develop stamina, while the faster running builds speed.  Until you lose a bit of weight though, i'd focus more on stamina.  Studies have basically shown that a mile burns about 100 calories no matter how fast or slow you run them, so the slower run will benefit you more only because you're burning twice as many calories.|`|4950a38055e3a23487ed7959fc7378b5aa	It would depend on what your goal is for that workout.<br>  <br>  Seeing as you are probably just running to keep in shape a little bit, the slow 3 would most likely be best for you.  It will burn more calories.|`|4gZYucHMaa	I just started this March and I find the best way is to go longer with a slower pace.<br>  <br>  It's given me the best results (lost 20 lbs).<br>  <br>  Running or rather sprinting around the block or 2 will not give you the results you're looking for.<br>  <br>  Better to go longer, slower and in time you'll increase your speed.|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	neither is better or worse.  One is for speed development the other is for endurance.  Do both.  
8a3822ced036f956bfbf2ffe198d7003aa	Slow pace could mean a number of things.  With a 5:30 mile...:<br>  <br>  -Your long run pace can be around 8 minute miles to 7:40 miles<br>  -Your tempo pace can be around 7:10 to 6:45<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!<br>  ~Abab|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	If that is your max speed I would recommend doing most of your running at about 8:00-8:15 pace.  |`|p4XKFMNDaa	About 7:45 to 8:15, but see for yourself. Time yourself for a mile going as fast as you can without getting uncomfortable. Your time will tell you what pace is right for you.|`|bLaElTPuaa	about 7-7:30 minute pace would be a good pace for somebody like you.|`|seIqGlECaa	For what.

ODORT37Paa	I can't disagree.  Football & boxing all rolled into one on the ice.  Non-stop action with skull cracking hits.

I would say boxing/UFC fighting are the toughest sports because the entire point is to knock the other player out, whereas the point of hockey is to score the most goals; the hitting and fighting are only a small part of the game.  But out of the top 4 sports, hockey is certainly the toughest.|`|sZbyEohxaa	i think ice hockey is like the toughest sport ever! i have played before and its really hard..you have to know how to skate. you need to have about 5 extra pounds of equipment. you need to be able to skate w/ a stick and try to keep the puck away from other people. you also need to like skate in any direction. and then like injuries! there are so many people who get hurt|`|ll2y4YIGaa	hockey or lacrosse.  probably because of the violence involved and the skill that is needed to participate fully.|`|YajYjjxLaa	i agree with almost everyone. hockey is the toughest sport.

Plus you take checks into boards (not to mention hip checks) and checks into hard ice supported by concrete under it and fighting is LEGAL. The only sport (besides boxing and the martial arts stuff) is allowed. Plus you got hooking and tripping and you also have a really hard puck sometimes going 90 MPH in your face or at your leg or chest if you're a defender.

iLXikGhDaa	If you're playing in the Rally point system ( 21-points ) then the serve goes to your opponent, then the score goes to 1-0.

You are right Robertson's jam used to use the golliwog in their advertising campaign, but they were stopped from using it as it was deemed 'offensive'. The golliwog was certainly based on the image of a black african. Yes the world is a little too sensitive these days, but Carol Thatcher was aware of what she was saying. It may be an old-fashioned and some-what upper-class term but it has for some time been thought of as derogatory. We wouldn't expect to hear a presenter refer to a black athlete as a ****** so we can't really accept anything else. Was the fact that the tennis player was black actually relevant to her point or had she just decided to point it out unnecessarily?|`|IxhQtq5Eaa	Well the word golligosh was  used in the twenty's and the w.o.g stands for westernised oriental Gentleman.

Plus how can you be the conference leader (Congrats Mike Brown on the All Star coaching selection), and only have one representative, while all the other way above .500 teams, Magic, Celtics, have 3 and 2 respectively.

FR6uVNPiaa	They are meant for before.  In order to provide nutrients and energy that you will use.  They tend to have a lot of sugars and carbohydrates that will give you energy for activity relatively quickly, and sustain it as long as possible using fiber to slow the digestion.  Basically it causes a spike in blood sugar.  Although different types may be used for greater endurance or greater short term benefit for the most part it will all be the same.  Apple cinnamon and Banana will always taste the best though.  Another option, but usually only in endurance sports is that it is to be eaten during a race, but in your case I would recommend about half an hour before.|`|bB3xOSLbaa	You can have them before your race or between races.

And if you have in between races, you can have it straight after your first race, or before your warm up for your second race.<br>  But all this depends on the person, everyone isn't the same.<br>  Eat them when you feel it's comfortable and ideal for you.<br>  Enjoy.|`|w4X6Y7tIaa	Before ..actually "powerbar" has a before,during,after line of products.

4kdm6khFaa	the only good way to get into shape for the sport and get better at it is if you play it . you are doing excellent. <br>  n_n!! you will hepl improve your resperitory , try to breath from your nose and breath out from your mouth, it helps you not to get tired right away.|`|60041585a09b26e28706e9097d4156a9aa	running|`|Ouz8nGDfaa	Jogging a lot! I mean, a lot. Our coach used to make us go out in like 109 degree weather and run for an hour straight. Just jog around and around the soccer field. The more you run, the less you feel tired. My best advice is to run marathons, or little 10K races for fun. That helped me condition. When your in good condition, you can endure a lot of running w/ out getting out of breath quickly. Good luck. <br>  If you want to get better at soccer, play with guys.|`|RQRGQgk3aa	Play more soccer. There's no substitute for playing more if you want to get better at Soccer.<br>  When you can't play then run or swim to build up your cardio and kick the ball against a wall or dribble it, knee bounce it, etc... around by yourself to improve your ball handling skills.|`|iyAO4T1caa	run intervals.  set up two cones like 30-50 yards apart, then sprint from one to the other, jog back, then sprint from one to the other again, walk back, then sprint....etc.  Figure out what your limit is running those and push it, then increase the number you do every work out.  Soccer conditioning is like that because thats how it is when you play, you need a short burst of energy, then you jog, then walk, then run, then sprint.<br>  <br>  Just jogging isn't really soccer specific, because it exercises your slow twitch endurance muscles, and for soccer you need fast twitch.  Although, jogging doesn't hurt either.  <br>  <br>  Pro soccer people condition by running wind sprints (interval training) and plyometrics (need a personal trainer) and playing helps a lot too.|`|jaJ1Ga58aa	What I do is just run a few miles -or yards- practice with a ball for a few hours, or just think really hard about the sport and you might get really good at it.

DcWaA1Sraa	Like yourself, I've just started running quite recently (last year) and already I've noticed a few positive changes, such as tighter and curvier backside and I don't over-eat anymore (I'm a vegetarian).  My stomach muscles don't really benefit from running, but I am a lot leaner around that area.    I think you should do separate abs workout after running.  I do yoga after my running.    Good luck.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	It doesn't necessarily work your abs, you need to do ab exercises for that.  It does, however, lower your body fat, so that everyone can see those abs you're working on.    As for healthy food - balanced diet.  Avoid trans fats, saturated fats, and junk food.|`|AA12367393	running clears fat away from your heart  that's why its called cardie    and i meditate while running so..;)|`|OsjT9jszaa	I run quite a bit (80+mpw when its not 0 degrees outside), and just by doing this I have gotten a pretty solid 6 pack.

If you want to work you abs do lots of crunches and sit ups

yJ8DqPA0aa	I personally hate the naming of other Markets, it should be called Mets stadium or something. Though they might need the money to do whatever, but the marketing names are out of hand|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Dude shea is gone there about a quarter of it left. Thell play in citi and thell still be citi field|`|M0eyMvqlaa	It's not that simple to just name it "Mets Stadium". They need sponsors, not to mention that citigroup deal is for 150 million for 20 years. No ones going to pick up that type of deal in these times, So I have no clue on what's going to happen. Citigroup has stated that the deal still stands, but we'll see. Peace!|`|RJghPceKaa	it would probably be named after the mets for a few years until they get a new sponsor|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Since the U.S. Government bailed out Citi Group they'll take over the naming rights as well.

If they have to change the name of the stadium before they can get another deal done with another company, change the stadium name to someone who was instrumental in helping the Mets win their two Championships.    Call it "Gil Hodges Memorial Field" and put the Hall of Fame to shame for not properly inducting this guy. He was the Manager that won the Mets' first ever Worlds Championship in 1969.|`|jKOB7n35aa	I would think it would just be Mets Field or Mets Stadium, or something like that until they get another naming deal.|`|ak5A435maa	it might turn into a name like Mets ballpark or something. i would like having another Shea Stadium, but it wouldnt be the same. maybe they should give this park a new name if it doesnt stay Citi Field|`|4TgxrCX4aa	Since the Mets have already invested in memorabilia and stadium fixtures including signs and uniform patches that all say Citi Field the name would probably remain the same while the Mets sue Citi to stay in the deal or the Mets change the name to Shea or Mets Field or something while the Mets sue Citi for the cost of all the stuff saying Citi Field and the Mets will look to sell naming rights again.  While I doubt Citi will back out, it's almost more expensive (and risky) to do so.
H7lJHxwGaa	I wouldn't buy from either Airsplat or Shortyusa, as airsplat was unreliable for me and Shortyusa has pretty high prices. If I were you, I would buy a $260 gun like a G&G GR-16 Carbine (Full metal) and upgrade it. Much better value, as you can customize it however you want to fit your needs (more fps? different body or stock? ROF based? Red dot sights?). Or perhaps gear like gloves and a uniform. But if you insist on getting a $400 gun, take your pick:    http://www.airsoftgi.com/index.php?cPath...

lT8MEI6Raa	Theoretically they should hit at the same time|`|N4t2t3dMaa	its common sence the bullet from the gun has more velocity because of the gun powder exploding behind it and the bullet that is dropped is working solely on gravity, bullet out of a gun is reaching a mush higher speed right from the start the bullet that is dropped takes time to reach its highest speed! just think of two cars the exact same, one is at a stop and the other is 200 yrds behind the other, the one that is farther bak takes off and the one in front cant leave till the other one passes by him (he can leave as soon as the other car is directly beside him but he must take off from a dead stop while the other is already traveling at a higher speed) so you tell me wich one will win!|`|kUj4AP46aa	Was the bullet fired horizontally from the same height that the other bullet was dropped?    if this is the case, theoretically, they would hit at the same time. Ballistics would prove that the bullet that was fired would travel in an arc, and would therefore hit the ground slightly AFTER the bullet that was dropped. But for physics class, they land at the same time, because physics neglects air resistance (which has a hand in causing the bullet's path to arc.) and assumes the bullet undergoes the physics concept of projectile motion.    If the bullet was fired downward, in the same direction that the dropped bullet took, the fired bullet will hit first. It has the force of the powder explosion and the force of gravity acting on it. The dropped bullet only has gravity, and will have a lower magnitude of acceleration.    If the bullet was fired upwards, you would have to use 2D kinematic equations to find it's exact time above the surface, but common sense would dictate that the dropped bullet would hit first without needing any calculation.|`|UJmfDAI9aa	They both, equal mass, will land at the same time, taking into account one does not experience any resistive forces on the way down that the other bullet does not.|`|ejoBcPDZaa	If both are at equal distance and the pistol is being pointed at the floor and the bullet starts to move after being shot and at that exact moment the other bullet is let go. There is no doubt in my mind that the bullet from the gun will hit the floor first. First of all the bullet in the gun is traveling at above 500fps. Which the one that u let go of is not. It's common sence. That's like saying if I threw this bullet at a target and I shot a target with this gun at the same distance which one would strike first. It's BS.    One is travelling a lot faster then the other. If you had a high speed camera it would look like the dropped bullet isn't even moving compared to the fired one.|`|HUQMqdDqaa	At zero elevation they both will fall at the same rate, which here on Earth is 9.81 m/s 2.|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	If you fire a bullet from a level gun and drop a bullet to the ground, from the same height. at the same time, the bullets would fall  at the same speed.     Since the earth is curved, and not a flat plane, the bullet fired from the gun would have to fall farther than the bullet that is dropped. The dropped bullet would strike the ground first.     But, bullets aren't nearly as much fun when you just drop them. I'll take the bullet fired from the gun even though it came in second place!|`|h2KkiKK3aa	the dropped one, because you didn't specify that angle of the shot.|`|1d4Vin3Waa	They did this on "MythBusters" if you are talking about a vertical shot. A bullet will reach ZERO vertical velocity and then fall back at its terminal velocity at the same speed a dropped bullet from the same height would. In terms of physics and trajectories, the bullet fired reacts to gravity at the same rate as the object falling.|`|tKWwZpOAaa	they are both suppose to hit at the same time since gravity is constant and they are the same mass|`|cLJT3yZNaa	If the experiment was performed in a vaacum, then both bullets would hit the ground together. But normally the bullet fired from the gun has a lot of forces on it and therefore the answer cannot be found.|`|AA11694178	In theory, with the gun barrel held horizontally and fired over an absolutely flat surface, both bullets will strike the ground at the same time.  Unfortunately, real life seldom absolutely mimics theory.  In real life there are far too many variables to give you an absolute relationship between the time the two bullets strike the ground in all occasions.
8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	Hey ichigofan,<br>  <br>  Kwame Brown will probably be released and be a free agent at the end of this year.  Some team will pick him up to be a backup because he's a decent defender. He is not a threat to get a double-double-- he has very poor offensive skills-and terrible hands and really the only time he should be shooting the ball is off of a rebound.  He's a pretty good defender but that's about it.<br>  <br>  No way the Heat will trade an all-star Shawn Marion for someone who will be a backup somewhere next year.<br>  <br>  Nickster|`|b492423af2d29fe3c720b5001a69bd89aa	your joking right?|`|ye3L3yfaaa	The only thing Brown brings to the table is some decent defence other then that he doesn't do much, but with Marion his an all star player who can d-up against anyone in the league so the heat would be making a very stupid move if they agreed to a trade like this deal.

At Dick's Sporting Goods they sometimes have shoes that you can try for 30 days to see if they will work well for you, and they promise to take them back no questions asked. I did this before, got them disgustingly gross, and they did indeed take them back. Make sure you're getting some very supportive shoes if you're doing rigorous trail running, and invest in some arch supports.  Keep them only as long as you keep your shoes, and try to honor the 500 mile rule. I like New Balance, Brooks, and some Nike models. Go some place that will take the time to answer all your questions and examine your flat feet and gait. Don't be afraid to spend money on good quality shoes, it's the only thing you'll have to invest towards in running. Hope this helps you! :)|`|V4GqMQkOaa	you should get some New Ballance zips from the site bellow and than get some ortotics and after you go out for a run ice your shins
5zSqeugCaa	I would suggest taking your gun apart, and clearing the barrel backwards (take a small long rod and pushing the .20 gram pellet out)  Then re-assembling the gun.  That is what I had to do, and I learned never to do it again.  Just aim lower, or get a new gun!|`|kIUtEEhRaa	Basically... it's the gun. There isn't really anything you can do about it.<br>  <br>  If you are using a gun that can only use .12 gram pellets then it's a very cheap model that is just meant for messing around shooting the air and stuff. Don't expect any sort of accuracy or adjustability from it.|`|t3nKTukoaa	get a new one. or take it apart and put a weaker spring into it|`|VENkB5i6aa	The .20g bb you used most likely wasn't of very good quality.

dqSqxpBWaa	Practice is the only way really, I'd keep the reps of a low distance (say 80 meters) and only do 6 but of a good quality with decent sized recovery (say 3 or 4 minutes) and do this twice a week or so.<br>  I'd cut down the 2-4 miles, because this will get your slow twitch muscle fibers (STMF) good, but your fast twitch muscle fibers (FTMF) will suffer, and the FTMF to STMF ratio won't be what it should be. Keep the training to shorter distances and at some serious speed. <br>  Weights can help to an extent, but not too much- if you overly bulk up then you'll gain too much muscle mass and have too much weight to carry/ it will limit your movement.<br>  Once you get a decent FTMF and are reasonably quick, up the distances and keep the recoveries, so you're speed endurance will pick up so you can keep going through all the bases without slowing up when you nail one!|`|Cbf3iZ3zaa	Everyday do the same thing. when you are on a run if you listen to music then on the first song you jog then the second you sprint.

TGijx96aaa	This is a common myth among women.  It is not possible for woman to produce large muscles, we do not produce enough testosterone to do it.  The girls that are either take a protein muscle enhancing pill, or they are part of the less then 1% of woman that do build large muscles.  From the sound of it you are not one.  To lose fat it has been proven that running at a consistent speed (one that you can carry on a small conversation) with bursts of speed in it.  Try running on a 5-6 on a treadmill or just a casual speed and every five minutes add in a 60 second sprint all out, then recover.  That is the only way to lose the weight, cardio.  Also to tone muscles lift until fatigued.  That is what I do and I am 5'7 113 pounds and toned.|`|c481d6a4ef704039aa0657efd6feed42aa	Wow sounds like you might have a interesting time with your new exercise undertaking. I would definitely suggest running at least 3-5 days a week. Begin your first runs around 15-25 mins. long. Then after you feel like your getting into better shape, you can bump up your time to 30 mins and more and more...<br>  Any runs your body does longer than 40 mins will begin to burn pure excess carbs and lipids. In other words PURE FAT. But this will take 1 or 2 months and a great deal of dedication. GOOD LUCK!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and for your upper body muscles, think about 10 mins alternating for push ups to crucnhes when you see fit. Will create muscle and burn fat faster. You must stay diligent w/ your work outs too.
jvLsrtBNaa	thats pretty good! a lot of cross country runners can keep their miles between 7-8 minutes....i know that the fastest kid at our school did just under 6 minte miles!! he's going to the olympics....|`|kurVssmbaa	10:49 woooooooooooooow that's simply amazing. especially for a girl. 2 consecutive 5:24:5 miles. you are really good. i wish i was as good as you I get like 12 flat and people on my cross country team tell that i am a beast. but i am nothing compared to you. you are probably easily in the the top 3 on you team if you are in high school of both boys and girls. |`|p4XKFMNDaa	I'm guessing you're new to cross country for several reasons. First of all, you don't know what a good time would be (not that that's a bad thing; you'll get better idea of goal times as you go on). Secondly, you don't seem to be sure of what time you got. Also, two miles at 9:34 is extremely good for a girl, so I'm guessing the course was less than two miles or your time was off.|`|fAq8IwR5aa	If that is really the time you ran in two miles that is a really really  good time, but that is a little hard to belive.

fUKWTjjiaa	if they stand up and take a step back its a pass except on a draw<br>  if they go forward its a run<br>  <br>  its pretty straight forward|`|DJvWWswcaa	If a guard pulls the play IS going that way and if you see a whole (or "Daylight") opening up then hit it because a back is probably coming through it. other than that just watch if they all downblock or pull or pass set. It just takes practice. Try watching college or NFL games or just get some film from your coach. Watch every lineman and what they do and decide how you would react to it. After awhile you wont have to think about it anymore|`|TgkJ9dDqaa	If you are trying to pick up things during the pre-snap, you need to look for tendencies on their first couple of offensive possessions.  Some linemen have tendencies such as the angle of their feet, the pressure on their hands (more white spots due to more pressure leaning forward) when preparing to block for a run.  If there appears to be more blood in the hands, the weight is a little back, indicating preparing to pull or block for a pass.  Of course, once the ball is snapped, the linemen tend to stand more upright when it is a pass or they dry drive forward for the run unless he is pulling.  Its good to watch two linemen next to each other...generally there is only one pulling...|`|9qPqnATCaa	look to see if the guards are pulling to one side or the other that usual signals a run

r27Fg79Paa	It comes down to simple facts, start with the NBA, it is meant to gather the most talented players in the USA. 9 times in 10, basketball is constant on their minds, cause the league is competitive, you cant perform soon into career, the franchise weighs the option, and the worst thing possible, being an unwanted free agent when you are still in your 20s. A pro ballplayer is his own critisizer, to improve on NBA expectations and earn respect from his teammates, coach and the crowd.<br>  <br>  Being in the NBA, the players are no doubt knowledgeable about who is getting the spotlight and all that. Just the ignorant and blind could miss the Celtics hype. Hawk and Piston ballplayers wanted to take a shot at Boston, and bad. Pro NBA players are talented themselves, and dont feel as much awe about the stars as the fans. There is just respect, and proving the people wrong. upsets.<br>  <br>  Bring up Michael Jordan, yes there were those who went up against him and never went past impressed, getting front row tickets to the show. BUT THEN there were others who became obsessed trying to stop him. Sir Charles. Patrick Ewing. Isiah Thomas. These fools put on spectacular performances to attempt to beat MJ and make him lose confidence, and the whole Air Jordan energy. Never personal, just making the Bulls earn every single ring pocketed in the 1990s.<br>  <br>  Its the same exact thing with the Hawks and Pistons|`|IYVdyw8Waa	because you gotta play the games and anything can happen|`|1avVKcbwaa	It's called FIXED|`|3teWTOPqaa	Celtics team didn't have experience at first because their core guys are relative new with playing one and another.

aAB1wXqUaa	Truthfully...RELAX...if you freak out, chances are you will totally mess up. Relax, be confident, and go out there and show your stuff! Anyways, you've been given a huge honor and compliment by being asked to try out. The worst that will happen is that you won't make it. The fact you've been asked to try out is huge and you've still got plenty of time left. You will do awesome, trust me. I might not know your name, but by hearing what you have to say, this is what you really want. You've got passion, something thats dying out between players.|`|k2bjQzMfaa	Thats  great! I wouldnt be nervous if I was you. If you make it, HOLY $H1T! YOU MADE A HS TEAM AS A 12th GRADER! If you dont make it YOU STILL WERE RECOMMENDED TO GO FOR THE TEAM. Getting your name in with the coach at a younf age is good too if you dont make the team. Im sure youll do great. Good Luck!|`|pfZzd6kOaa	Just to let you know, you posted this twice. I don't know if you meant to...<br>  Anyways, instead of freaking out, take it as a huge compliment. Go to the high school soccer tryouts and DO IT. Your coach knows what he's talking about. Besides, whats the worst that could happen? You don't make it? So what? You're left with two things. 1. A chance in a lifetime experience, and 2. A huge compliment that should kick your ego up a notch. Good luck!|`|XleaHtwHaa	Before you go to tryouts, practice a couple drills you already know you're pretty good at to get your confidence up - just go out and show 'em what you've got!|`|6bqjx5nSaa	Just be confident and the the coach will see that.  If you're nervous they will see that.

In high school for tournament time there is a limit on how many can come in uniform for some states. In NH you can only have 25 girls uniformed, but you can have more than that on a regular team.

SCpPquCdaa	I'm a sophomore girl and i can run 3 miles in about 20 minutes....and most guys on my team can run it in under 18.....you need to run way more than 1.5 miles every day.  we run at least 6-7 every day, on with some days, fast sprints of just under 1 mile with a warmup and warm down in between.  Basically....just start running....A LOT....good luck!|`|c37589c86bed3b32aeac260bd1a723c8aa	do intervals on a quarter mile track.  60 second lap times. It seems like sprints but you already do the distance. Even do laps in your military boots. Eventually you get used to running at a quicker pace.   |`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	well honestly , the only way you will get better is to run more than 3 miles at a time.  It would be like you running 200 meters a day and then I say, " Boy , get out there and run a mile as fast as you can and get er' done."  You see what I am saying.  You need to run intervals, long distance days ( build to 6 miles), and common days ( just go out for a run.)  3 miles in 18 minutes is a fairly respectable time ( 18:30 5k) if you want run some road races to get in a competitive comaderie.  You will have to work for that time.  |`|nI9gXEHxaa	u need to be running about 4 miles almost everyday, not race pace but not stopping.<br>  i do cross country at school and we have 4 days of about 50 mins of running. on one day we have a sped workout, where we sprint intervals of about 1/4 miles
54IAwUDqaa	NO U DO NOT<br>  <br>  unless there are cuts, and i can't think of any school where they would say "no u can't run xc (cross country) at all" you might end up running jv or someting depending on you age<br>  <br>  <br>  if u not in shape, that's fine, you'll get there. maby not in 1 season.....def not in one season, but you willl def see imporivment if you work at it<br>  <br>  <br>  running is like most things<br>  <br>  you get what u put into it<br>  <br>  or to quote the beatles, the love you get is equal to the love you make lol|`|SauYxfNraa	it would help f you had started in junior high or middle school but all i can say is it will be very had considering some runners are averaging a mile in four minutes thirty seconds i have ran varsity for two years so just lettin you know it will take alot of effort<br>  |`|1e9837b90fb6cd2da8f7ba59782f65a1aa	No way the flabbier the better.|`|nLMifJfVaa	Pretty much.|`|sZhTwzh4aa	i started cross country my sophomore year of high school. =)<br>  <br>  if you're not really in shape going in, then it'll be tougher for you, but they definitely keep it at a level where you could do it if you weren't just like, "omg this is hard. i give up." as soon as it started hurting. i would recommend joining it, because of the sense of comaraderie [it's like a miniature family; at least on the girl's team] and it's fantastic to gradually see yourself improving!!!! =D <br>  <br>  //have fun!///|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	I would recommend doing a little before you go.  The thing is , man, that cross country will get you in shape.  You will not make the varsity shape right away( they are in shape) but if you run with heart you will gain your coaches respect and you will improve.  Join cross country it is a great decision, there is so much more to gain than you will loose ( a little bit of the day ).  
6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	you should just generally eat more fruits, grains , vegetables and just a little less meat ( a little), don't be obsessive about it.  I would recommend running track too , it helps generally.  In the winter I would just build up to 40 miles per week or whatever you feel is comfortable and then starting in about week 4- I would add in some speed work in about a month, hopefully, the track team will start to practice.  I would recommend cutting out all of your softdrinks if possible, it sounds hard , but once I started it got easier.  Also , what you eat before a meet really matters.  I would NOT RECOMEND pizza for lunch, the day of a meet, two days before it is really good.  In your "off season" I would recomend running a road race or something like that, it cost a little money but it is fun and diferent.  For now though, I recommend taking a week off like I will and then slowly build back up ( you will loose nothing in a week).  I also recommend icing your legs after long and hard runs because it helps in recovery.  When summer training comes it really counts.  Take it from day one " with heart."  Good luck with your training man.<br>        Source:  2 year cross country runner.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But too succeed you must have the heart to win and the most important , You must have FAITH.|`|9vkLxOqyaa	well, you should definitely be ready for the challenge, be brave and run and do your best<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry my answer wasn't that great <br>  but good luck.

cwPGf76iaa	I think you hide the ball<br>  and tag thee person<br>  I am 95%<br>  positive<br>  and 100% sure everyone else is wrong|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Well, there are two different styles. <br>  In one style, you only get points when its your serve. Meaning, if you put it down on their side of THEIR serve, you don't get a point, but you get the serve. This is usually played to 15 points<br>  In the other style, you get a point for putting it down on the other side no matter who's serve it was, plus whoever got the point gets the next serve. This is usually played to 21 points. <br>  It just depends what club/school/association you play with. I play with fanshawe college and OBA (ontario badminton association) and we play every point counts (the second way)<br>  The rules depend on whether you are playing singles or double/mixed, but its more of less like tennis (the lines and stuff) but with different scoring :)<br>  Basically you serve cross court. If it's out/long/short/ on the wrong side and the other team doesn't touch it, THEY get a point. It they DO touch it, it's in play til it hits the ground. If they don't touch it, but it lands in, you get a point. <br>  You can't touch the net. <br>  The the lines for serving are long and thin for singles (in front of the very back line, behind the serve line, and between the centre line and the inside side line on whichever half is cross court from the person serving. If it's doubles, it's still the same front and centre line, but the court is wide and short, so it's the second line from the back and the outside side lines. <br>  Once the bird is in play, it's the outside side lines for doubles, the inside side lines for singles, and for both the net and the very back line. <br>  If you are serving and have an even number of points, you'll serve from the right. If you have an odd number, you serve from the left. You can't touch the middle or serve line when your serving. For doubles, one person serves the entire time THEY have the serve. It doesn't switch people until they lose a point, it goes to the other side, and comes back. It goes back and forth between people and still follows the even-right odd-left rule. <br>  I think thats about all you need to know.. Oh, and you can serve any way you want, but you can't make contact with the bird higher than your belly button (so you cant throw it up and smash it). And if the bird lands ON the line, it's IN. <br>  <br>  Those are enough rules to get you started. I personally prefer counting every point and playing 3 games to 21, but it's up to you. <br>  Some of the rules (like serving) are of course different for different leagues, but those are the general rules to get you started.<br>  <br>  Let me know if you have any more questions :)<br>  <br>  |`|pg5AHNcdaa	You do only get points while serving. If they serve, you hit it in bounds on their side, you then get the serve, you then get a good shot in bounds on their side and you score a point. |`|iLXikGhDaa	In the point system that is used today, the 21 point rally system. You get a point no matter if you serve or not. In the old point system, the 15 point system. You can only get a point when you're serving. <br>  |`|AkcP8t3Uaa	ok, jokes aside. Just hit the shuttlecock down to the ground on your opponent's side, you'll score. (provided that the cock landed IN the box) ... (i er mean shuttlecock)

On the road I clocked a 15:45 and on the trail I clocked 17:13.  Don't worry about the average time, seek to go beyond the ordinary.  Train with heart and faith, enjoy the journey, God speed.|`|b89431a3195bd85fbbd28be4880b2ffeaa	My 5k time was bout 26 mins. Thats 5.2 mins per km. It depends if you are a regular runner or a first timer. I am.. younger and the first time i did it i did it in 26 mins. The older more frequent runners would probably be able to do it in 15 or 20 mins. So, i would say first time average is around 23 - 25 mins and a frequent runner average is about 17 - 20 mins. Remember, training wont get you the same results as the actual marathon because in the marathon you get this 'feeling' or hype inside you and you can run faster, for longer. Hope this helps.|`|5bbeb8c777a097fb118ea4a6da7ba967aa	My PR is 17:30 and i'm a sophomore.  This what I think is an average time for a 5k in my league.

If it NFL rules/field, yes the NFL players would win.  But play AFL rules/arena and I think the AFL players would win.  Both are football, but in many ways different.  For those that say AFL players are less talented and can't play in the NFL.. Many AFL players have gone to the NFL just as NFL players have dropped into the AFL.  The AFL players are very talented and Michael Irving even admitted that he would have a more difficult time playing in the AFL than the NFL.|`|MPDgKgIxaa	The NFL should win but the AFL can make it a good game for a while, NFL wins 38-20.<br>  <a href="http://americanfootballpredictions.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...</a><br>  <a href="http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...</a>|`|l3y23yVcaa	The NFL all stars would win by a ridiculous margin...<br>  <br>  Essentially, Arena football players are guys who didn't make even the practice squad on an NFL team...|`|AA10766947	To throw a little twist in this. I think that it would be a even game after the first couple of plays. On any given sunday you can lose to any teams. The NFL is a game that built around who is who? or better yet who your agents are in the draft. It all about money and not the love of the sports. You have alot of player who could play in the league but you have to have this size, weight, height or what school you attended. If the game was played like the old days then you could say that The NFL would win. You have alot of guys in the Arena League that can play if they had a chance. The league is not the same to many rules and the owner are getting greedy. If you take away the TV and let the fans see a good game then we could really see some games for ages.|`|57XQeNZ1aa	The NFL would win 82-3.

Qf4HcMkWaa	I dont know yet give them one more year and ask me then.|`|7UfhrqOfaa	They are a very improved team that is performing very well under rookie QB Matt Ryan and LT ex-backup, Michael Turner. Even their defense has improved in the last couple of games. I think if they keep it up then they can make the playoffs but they will have tough competition in getting there because their division, the NFC South has the best combined record in the NFL.|`|3T2s2Snuaa	I think they will win the division, and get a Bye for the 1st round of the playoffs, I also look for them to win at least one playoff game, possible 2 to get to the SB, then it all depends on who they face in the SB (saying if they make it)|`|MTRtqDJCaa	I really like the way Matt Ryan is playing, but I think they have a shot at a playoff spot in taht weak division. Hopefully he keeps playing well.  They have to get that running game going to help him out too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com</a>|`|jQnJSLwtaa	I see them getting in to a wild card playoff spot and Matt Ryan winning rookie of the year over a slight margin over chris houston|`|c4GE8idmaa	i think their good but i hate them im a panthers fan always will be

AA10572918	I know they very seldom to give it to relief pitchers but Brad Lidge is a key reason that the Phillies are the 2008 World Series Champions. I hope he gets it. If not, Lincecum deserves it for having an incredible season with that horrid Giant baseball team.|`|ODORT37Paa	I'd love to see Lidge win it.  41-41 in save opportunities for the world champions?  Why shouldn't he get the award?<br>  If I had to put money on it though, it would be:<br>  <br>  1) Sabathia<br>  2) Lincecum<br>  3) Santana<br>  4) Lidge|`|WOcjc6vZaa	not as many as he deserves.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	8 votes, 10 points. We now know.<br>  |`|kxCBmoQXaa	He won't get too many. He doesn't deserve to win Cy Young, that's a starters award to win. Lidge should win MVP, he was by far the most valuable player to his team in the NL, and his incredible save numbers prove it.

UBIlwiALaa	As other above me said don't get rid of Smith b/c he is your 2nd best receiver.  CJ doesn't have anyone to throw him the ball and is getting the main coverage now that R. Williams is gone.  Keep him and see if can unload any of the other 3 Evans, Johnson, or Cotchery for a 2 for 1 good or decent running back.|`|NeYFiGmRaa	Other than Boldin, I'd rather lose any of your WR's than Steve Smith, you don't need all of them heading into the playoffs, unload Cotchery and CJ or Evans for Lynch.|`|MTRtqDJCaa	I would do it.

UxooffHZaa	I hope well, as he's my fantasy football TE this week. |`|tG5Ar7DIaa	You know...Kellen Winslow is a great player.  I like him, and I'm glad that the Browns have him...but, he needs to get his head in the game and follow his routes.  It's hard to say, because I don't know how Quinn will do....I think that Quinn can beat the Broncos offense  I'd say that he does okay today, and the Browns lose 31-28.<br>  <br>  Go Brownies!|`|MTRtqDJCaa	I think he'll play great.  He's very good at taking small things and using them as huge motivators. I'm sure in the postgame conference, he'll mention what happened and how he can overcome anything. Then he'll compare himself to He-man or something like that.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com</a>|`|vgt0YtRxaa	He is going to tear the Bronco's leagues worst defense up. Even Brady Quin well look like a seasoned vet against the Bronco's|`|sAHTMuAeaa	yes I couldn't agree more with you...<br>  <br>  The brownies suck, almost as much as winslow.  Winslow really sucks.  <br>  <br>  Has he learned how to ride a motorcycle yet?  He should hang out with  Big Ben...|`|tDNDFtGyaa	denver sucks.... its up to tom brady oops i meant brady quinn! <br>  I dont think Quinn will be ready but he might use Winslow as a security blanket!|`|v0ECH9iSaa	I think Kellon Winslow will do just fine and so will Braylon Edwards.As a matter of fact I think the team as a whole will do better because they'll have a quarterback that will be there not only to lead but perform as a team player as well. In my opinion,they seem to play better as a team when they have a quarterback they're comfortable with.              GO BROWNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5UA8rm6taa	He probably wont do too well because he has to play with his STD...that would suck. HAHAH jk. I think he will have an average night|`|9ZYXdtmuaa	nice picture, lol.  he will probably catch 3 balls for around 45 yards and one touchdown|`|cA9k0SL1aa	 he will get one reception for 5 yards!!  he is an arrogant punk!!!
akpe0bTBaa	I live in birmingham England and i Batista must be the moodiest guy on the planet. he was on a talk show recently when he was in england like a week ago (The Paul O'Grady show) and a kid was on about 9 who was a massive wrestling fan and batista was just sitting there giving one word answers and had a mood on him.<br>  <br>  Randy orton was on Sky Sports News (like just before summerslam) and he was answering questions and having a joke around with the presenters.<br>  <br>  Make your own mind up dude =)<br>  |`|bSsBGrZVaa	YES ITS TRUE THAT ORTON IS A NICE PERSON<br>  & BATISTA IS A RUDE PERSON IN REAL LIFE|`|S0u3HKzhaa	I don't know if Randy is the nicest to say guy outside of the ring but when he is with his fans and outside doing tours and other stuff he always seems to being joking around and he seems pretty nice.Although Randy has been suspended for some anger problems it's seems since he's got married and has a daughter he hasn't been any reports on anger issues etc.. But Batista isn't to nice just by the way he interacts with is fans in my opinion. And no not all faces are nice and all heels are evil it's just there wrestling character on a sports entertainment show. <br>  Like someone for younger kids I would say wh is a role model is John Cena because I had taken my 3 old nephew to a wwe autograph signing and some of the superstars were rather rude at it.Like some who's play faces and stuff like that. Like Ashley for one wasn't even listening to him she just was listening to her i-pod and she spelled his name wrong on the paper! And I was pretty pissed about that it's like he is only 3 really! But other guys were really nice like Maria was really nice so was Edge and Cm Punk.(We only went to a few because we got there late so he didn't get to see Cena) But then we were about to leave and my fiancee turned around because she thought she dropped something and John Cena was standing right there and he actually sign my nephew's shirt and posed for a picture with him which I thought was very nice of him to do.|`|1UKAho1iaa	That's really sweet of him. I have heard that Batista is a jerk, but I doubt this is true of every face. I also doubt that every heel is a good person. It just depends on the guy, not on whether he's a face or heel.|`|a0fbc7e562f77c8c20b9a0ba1a3cf3bdaa	Unfortunately...  Batista is kind of arrogant towards fans outside the ring...  <br>  <br>  But actually Randy Orton is not the nicest guy outside the ring from the WWE wrestling...   The nicest guy outside the ring is The Big Red Monster "Kane"<br>  <br>  Way to Go Kane!!!|`|UWJinEbIaa	Randy has been suspended several times for being "unsportsmanlike" to fellow employees of the WWE.|`|VRsTuRz9aa	He is a very nice guy out of the ring. But not the nicest. Also heels and faces are just part of their character in WWE, but not their actual character in real life. But their are people who are the same in the ring as they are outside of the ring, people like John Cena, Jeff Hardy, Triple H. But I am a huge fan of John Cena, and I genuinly believe that he is the most genuine and most down to earth guy and one of the nicest guys you could ever meet.|`|SkQ2EZ66aa	well the nicest wrestlers i have meet are Kurt Angle and Hulk Hogan. As for Batista definately not even friendly at all. Randy Orton i see could be. Vince and Triple HHH and Vince's whole family is amazing people outside of the ring. I talked to Vince and Triple HHH via cell phone cause my mom called me and put them on a phone at a new years eve party.|`|kjCz5PYeaa	Well in front of the camera anyone can keep a fake smile..<br>  <br>  But i guess Orton is an awesome personality outside the ring...Jeff Hardy is also a great person outside..He do care about his fans a lot..Well John Cena is the greatest and nicest guy to ever step into the ring and outside with his 97% pure heart..He's awesome!<br>  |`|vh2tuGZPaa	I think he can be immature at times , but he seems overall a nice guy - Batista is moody I would say , depends on what mood he's in - LOL the Baddie  award - least he has a sense of humor- John Cena is a really nice guy , as is Edge - Y2J is supposed to be pretty nice to ,|`|MTRtqDJCaa	Seems to be that way, cause even Lesner is pretty cool outside the ring but he looks like an animal in there.  Of course Kimbo as an all-around heel, but I hear Ortiz is pretty cool too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com</a>|`|Ad8m1dYXaa	Great Ormond Street hospital! I spent the first few months of my life there... lol<br>  <br>  He seems like a really nice man... He has been suspended before (as mentioned above) for unprofessional behavior, but, I think he has changed his ways now...|`|QouSk1E7aa	No, Y2J is the nicest. Edge is also cool outside the ring.|`|X6eIquGCaa	lol<br>  cena is a face and nice<br>  <br>  <br>  i wonder if undertaker is nice|`|TbluUF2Haa	Yeah Randy Orton seems a nice guy. i thought batista was okay but i saw him on Paul O` Grady and he was there because a huge Wwe fan who was 12years old and was in a wheelchair. Batista answered with like 5 word sentences and sat there not talking or joking.
2Xx0Cm2Caa	Do you think Kobe, Lebron, or Jordan ever quit!?  NO!!  Keep practicing everyday!  Don't stop practicing even when you think your tired and you don't have anything left, push yourself to practice and train harder and longer!  It's hard work and if you want to be the best then you have to train and practice like the best.  Go Google/research some workouts and conditioning programs and start to follow those step by step.  Try to find a professional NBA workout and go by that!  This kind of transformation doesn't happen over night so be patient and work hard!  It'll happen sooner or later!<br>  <br>  Good luck!  And never give up!
MTRtqDJCaa	It's actually tempting, Marion's stats won't be as good as last years, at least not hit points, but West and Randolph pretty much cancel out.  So it's pretty much Marion for Dalembert.  Do you need blocks and rebounds? Dalembert gives you about 2 more blocks and 3 more rebounds than Marion, plus your losing Marion's steals. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't do it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com</a>|`|zifcapOxaa	hell no!
tt4ErW4paa	In the regular season games can only have one overtime it is announced before the overtime starts that if neither team scores in the 15 minutes then the game is a tie.  A tie is counted as worse than a win but better than a loss.  As far as winning percentage goes it is basically like a 1/2 win.  The Eagles have played 10 games and are 5-4-1 so they have a .550 win percentage.|`|y0jL9n6Taa	The Philly Pigeons are now 5-4-1.  And it really screws up the play offs.  That is if the Pigeons were going to the playoffs.|`|6e55ba828401d3fe8d83682808d3cce8aa	Yah because playoffs need a winner because if no winner no one can advance to the next round. During the season, it doesnt matter because there will be another game the next week. You have 16 weeks to make your playoff bid.|`|hPqqNFuYaa	It's only playoff games that go to more overtimes.  The game counts as a tie.  It's better than a loss, but worse than a win.  Example in the standings would be if the Eagles won out, they'd be 11-4-1, they would be ahead in the standings of an 11-5 team because they have one less loss.  So in that rare occasion it could be seen as a good thing.|`|04Oej4rsaa	In the playoffs you need a winner to advance to the next round.  The regular season has no need for a winner.  The overtime rules are different in college, with each team getting a chance with the ball in each overtime.  That is why you can see games with multiple overtimes.
MTRtqDJCaa	I like the Patriots in this game.  Cassell has been playing better and Favre is due for another 3 INT game.<br>  <br>  Patriots by 10.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com/</a>|`|T1R6UZDOaa	I would have to say the New England Patriots. I usually watch college football.  GO Gamecocks!!!  My brothers would be made if I didn't say New England Patriots.|`|tak6xnfVaa	The Jets are on a roll and they will win.<br>  <br>  Jets by 7|`|f1HKgd4Gaa	Jets will win |`|7UfhrqOfaa	I think you are leaving out a TON of key players for both teams (Thomas Jones for the Jets would def. be a key player and maybe even Calvin Pace), but to the original question I think if the Pats defense can play like they have the past couple of weeks then I think the Pats will win a close game in the upper 20's maybe lower 30's. But that just could be my hometown bias.
iLXikGhDaa	There is no such thing as a Yonex ArcSaber 8 Badminton racket yet, the recent ArcSaber racket that Yonex produced is called the "ArcSaber 9." There are currently only 3 rackets in the ArcSaber series for Yonex, the ArcSaber 10, 9, and 7.
iLXikGhDaa	There is one common Badminton strategy to win in Singles, and that is clearing and then dropping. Another strategy to win is hitting to your opponents backhand because most people have weak backhands. You have to look at your opponent's game then determining what the best strategy is.
4Pe8yZnuaa	Running at a brisk pace, you should be able to do it in about 9 minutes.   Doing it in 12 minutes is jogging......|`|ToxDHYsaaa	This should be easy.<br>  <br>  Edit ... <br>  well think about it there is 1609 metres in a mile that's four times round the 400 track add the half the mile and your be running 6 times round the track. so Basically you have 2 minutes to achieve 400 hundred metres.<br>  The 400m world record stands at 43.18, obviously you wont be achieving this kind of time and your body will get tired the further you run but i doubt you it will take you 2 minutes to run 400 metres break it down further and you have 30 seconds to run 100 metres in . <br>  The point im trying to make is running distance is all about breaking the distance down, when people run marathons they cut it up into stages otherwise the task seems to daunting.<br>  Im 20 years old and am training for the london marathon, i used to compete in the 1 mile event, i know its all about believing in yourself and telling yourself not to stop running and to run faster.<br>  <br>  If you would like to know about training would need to know more specific facts ... age, body type, fitness level ETC.<br>  <br>  Other then that just run three times a week say 1.7 miles, trying to get faster everytime. dont forget about what you eat before the run aswell. <br>  How important is it you get this time? Is it for one of the forces?<br>  <br>  Edit ... <br>  Well first of all make sure you have a nice big pasta meal the night before the run. 3 hours prior to the run the best thing to eat is patatoes, they are a great energy provider.<br>  <br>  Training... its pretty important you get this result so i would run no less than 3 times a week, as i said before run just a little further than the distance 1.5 miles. Always take a stopwatch and make sure you get faster everytime. Dont build muscle as a guy earlier said, you need to keep muscle lean as muscle weighs more than fat. try a road run, running in the gym is boring and has no atmosphere so all your thinking about is running, where if your on the road you have different things going on around you, also listen to music to motivate you. Using the bike is good as this work just your legs and the core of your body. If you wanted to do weights keep the weight low and the repitions high this will work on toning your body and will help your endurance in the muscles. Hope this helps JJ|`|sL5CY6Q7aa	well it all depends on how good of shape you are in. your goal is basically an average of an 8 minute mile. for some that is easy but for others it might not be as fun. i am a xc and track runner, so this would be simple for me. all u gotta do is keep a steady pace of just under 8 minutes... and if you know u will slow down towards the end, then try to go a little faster during the beginning. keep a watch on you so u can keep up with your time... if you are close to the time limit and are still semi-far away, then give it all u got in the end|`|g2SyflWxaa	Hi Jess just make sure you check what the doctor has written on your medical history you can see it before they send it off to the Army medical centre , my son is back at Whittington on tuesday for his second medical, we have had to pay for a consultation from a specialist to prove he does not have the ailments that our gp listed by mistake , so best of luck Jess Regards Ann-Marie.|`|PRsEdZyLaa	its BLOODY easy in a fartlect i was doing 2800m(400m off 2 miles) in 16 mins and im not that fit really and built for rugby<br>  <br>  n.b. i done a lap of 50's then 100's then 150 then 200 then down to 50's again|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	on a treadmill it is impossible.

BgY5Z5qjaa	Lets round your number to 22 minutes to make the<br>  calculation easier. That gives you a 7.33 minute-mile.<br>  Since this is with huge hills, you will run faster on<br>  a flat surface. <br>  To be conservative, lets say you run 7 minute miles.<br>  Then, 4K=2.5 miles, so you will come to about<br>  7*2.5=17.5 minutes. I think you will do better than<br>  17 minutes. Hope this helps!|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	I could say bout 18:30.  
RqQDKEVHaa	Either one would be good.<br>  <br>  You definitely have the build for BJJ. On the other hand, you're correct that most of BJJ is spent on the ground. (My son started with more traditional martial arts, then picked up wrestling, then BJJ and grappling. It drives him absolutely crazy when competing against someone with just a BJJ background when they instantly fall back into guard. So I understand your concern and frustration.)<br>  <br>  The question, also, is how practical do you want it to be? Some types of Taekwondo are fine for certain competitions (forms, musical forms, etc.), but really aren't good when it comes to actual fighting and self-defense. It really depends on how it's taught.<br>  <br>  I wasn't familiar with Hokutoryu, but looked it up and it seems interesting. You might also consider muy thai--good for self-defense and it's a stand-up skill.<br>  <br>  There are also some mixed martial arts. My son started off studying Hwardo. <a href="http://www.grandmasterhykwon.com/home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.grandmasterhykwon.com/home.ht...</a>  While Grandmaster Kwon is based in Virginia, there are schools around the world. It's great for physical fitness and is very practical. However (at least as it's taught in the U.S.) it doesn't emphasize competition.<br>  <br>  Another possibility is to go to a school that offers lessons in many. And then you can pick and choose. Here are links to a couple in my area: <a href="http://www.lloydirvin.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lloydirvin.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.onespiritmartialarts.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onespiritmartialarts.com/</a><br>  <br>  Those are just examples. But you might want to find a school like that near you.<br>  <br>  Best thing to do would be to try several of the different disciplines out. Most schools give you several weeks or a month of free lessons. See which one(s) you like.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|gBO908P6aa	Go with TKD.  You seem very athletic and I think the TKD culture will definitely fit in with you.<br>  <br>  Note:  BJJ draws it's ne-waza from Judo yes, but the differences are quite distinct.  Judo is reknown for its throwing techniques, which are far better than the takedowns of BJJ, a style that is more ground oriented.|`|N5SVU6Xwaa	ok listen tkd is all show and no go, if you want to do standing martial arts do kickboxing or muay thai i would choose muay thai, and for ground fighting do jujitsu, submission fighting, judo, and for mixed styles i would do krav maga, mma, and sambo, or combat sambo<br>  <br>  if you think this is best answer please give it to me|`|MTRtqDJCaa	Have you thought about Brazilian Jujitsu? It is a more defensive martial art, not as much focus on striking, more on disabling your opponent. Your right that your long legs would help with leverage, but can also be a hinderance if you don't work on your balance.  It should be a great challenge for you. Good luck dude.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com</a>|`|LnJjS8BRaa	Jujitsu and BJJ are different arts. Think of BJJ as closer to Judo than Jujitsu. <br>  <br>  A Jujitsu class should also train in stand up fighting but this is limited because the techniques were initially designed to be used against an armoured samurai. Punching an armoured opponent isn't too effective so a lot of the techniques take advantage of leveraging against armour (or a gi or clothes). <br>  <br>  You should also get a good amount of weapons training in a proper jujitsu class.<br>  <br>  As for the long limbs helping with leverage, that actually works against you not for you. A lock basically turns your arm into a lever and so with a longer arm the force is greater because of the the longer lever.<br>  <br>  Try them both out, both styles should be a lot of fun. Decide which one has the best instruction and which you are most interested in and sign up.|`|qNAgLIGJaa	If you don't want to fight on the ground, don't do bjj, wrestling, or judo.  With your size and length, you would make a top flight tkd or muy tai guy.  Another great option, although difficult to find, is escrima.  This is a filipinoi martial art that incorporates weapons and open handed techniques.  The great thing with escrima is that the movements with and without weapons are almost identical.<br>  <br>  You could also put on another 200 pounds and learn traditional sumo.  JK.|`|1VvIANPFaa	I would suggest kenpo, but out of those 2 i would suggest jujutsu|`|Hd41uJa0aa	Do Brazilian jiu jitsu.  Its great fun, a really good workout, and good for self defence.  Size also isn't important as a small guy with good technique and proper application of leverage can beat a much bigger and stronger opponent.<br>  <br>  I haven't done TKD but I do karate and BJJ and I have to admit I look forward more to the BJJ classes each week, and if I was forced to pick just one I'd go with the BJJ.  I tend to find the BJJ more interesting as at the end of each session we do free sparring which really helps you improve but with the karate, until you get to higher levels and have suitable levels of control you don't do much sparring so everything is more theoretical than practical. <br>  <br>  However, unless you are very disciplined you may get tired of BJJ as you don't grade very often (can take 2 years to grade from white to blue belt) so a lot of people get disillusioned and feel they aren't making any progress.<br>  <br>  Most places will allow you a free training session, so give both a try and see which you prefer.|`|yjyBbVJoaa	have you considered tai chi? mix it up with karate or any other martial art and you will have discipline of mind and body. But you have to have the right teacher who can train you in application. Later leading to sword form which is what I aspire to .
2LRhYziyaa	No, you can do over arm clears and smashes. You aren't allowed to do over arm serves though, which is what your badminton teacher probably meant.|`|iLXikGhDaa	Overarm shots are legal in Badminton. For the serve, it has to be done below the waist. |`|vnYYH4fMaa	I think they're legal. The serves should not be overhand, maybe that's what he means.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers.
iLXikGhDaa	There are quite a few shots in Badminton<br>  Drives<br>  Netshots<br>  Smashes<br>  Clears<br>  Lifts<br>  The most powerful attacking shot would be a smash. Badminton isn't all about power though. A drop to the opponent when he's in the backcourt can be more effective then doing a smash, sometimes.<br>

And Rasheed contract is over after the next season and the only way they woould be able to sign LeBron or Bosh or Wade or Stoudemire, is if the do not resign Iverson at end of this year, and do not resign Sheed and end of the next year.|`|gTqSEncHaa	Detroit has a good shot of getting LeBron. However, I do not see the Jazz letting Boozer go. They should do whatever to get him back cause he is a great player. Same thing with Bosh. But who knows. Detroit has money and good management. And they are always seen as championship contenders. So players will want to play for them.|`|MTRtqDJCaa	Lebron won't be a free agent til 2010.  They will most likely let Iverson at the end of the season.  They might bring in Bosh and let go of 'Sheed (I think his contract is up to), then go hard at Lebron in 2010.<br>  <br>  Good question man<br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com</a>|`|uD3LIDCdaa	if you were LeBron and had your choice of cities to live in, would you pick Detroit?

But any way Nash definitely made the fight worse because i think it would of just ended right there and they would of played intense basketball the rest of the night but Nash had to do that and risk possible injures, <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.belemasporttalk.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.belemasporttalk.com/</a>|`|6YnP3S0Uaa	He didn't really fight...he just ran up and got tossed by T-Mac.  I really don't understand why you run up to the altercation in the first place..that's how all of the last couple of big brawls got started.  If he was coming to separate his teammate he shouldn't have ran cause it intensified the whole skirmish.  It was fun to watch though. |`|GBGcI509aa	people are making it sound like a real fight happen lol.<br>  <br>  i kinda think nash has little man syndrom but i give it to him for takin one for the team lol.<br>  <br>  shaq shoulda gotten ejected.|`|cvd5S7pGaa	It was kinda funny, although shaq should have been ejected too for knocking over both tmac and yao<br>  <br>  Nash can take it he takes charges like no one else his size|`|6da83fff8d7abf8b5c05b2d96fffb480aa	lol, I was just trying to back up my brother. I had to go in there and show off my guns. I had to show everyone that I wasn't hitting the weights everyday for nothing. And Tracy comes out of nowhere and deals me a cheap shot to the ground, but good old Shaq-daddy had my back. Tracy was lucky Leandro was holding me back, otherwise I would have taken out his entire team. |`|6jErufVYaa	I don't know what he was thinking. McGrady was separating Alston away from Barnes and Nash ran to jump on Alston. And it all made things worse.<br>  <br>  The question is: Would you have done the same thing Alston did after Barnes shoved him with an elbow? I bet you, you would.|`|g0bd8Htmaa	nash was pushed down easily to the floor by tmac. shaq, on the other hand, pushed both yao and tmac to floor. he even pushed rafer. of course, they're smart enough not to push him back. lol. <br>  <br>  matt barnes was just too physical for this game.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkjWnoM7WD0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkjWnoM7W...</a>|`|x6MijuNIaa	He got knocked down my T-Mac.  Shaq though.  Shaq was pushing everybody down.  Was it: Yao, T-Mac, then that group of people with Alston in it.  He looked like he was in it just to push down people XD.  Rockets won too.  That makes me happy.|`|jlEOoVxVaa	Oh my GOD I were almost asleep til I heard noise on the t.v. I couldn't believe it. What were Nash thinking?|`|NN2hT9qsaa	its hard to fight when you get pushed on your back lol  shaq looked like the big kid in the school yard playin king of the mountain lol|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	Shaq almost killed everyone! hahaha  He showed us his super human strength! lol<br>  <br>  Poor Steve... lol
AA11303083	NO, it was probably Jones's last fight in front of his home crowd and he wanted to last the full 12 rounds like a true champ. The cut wasn't going to kill him, they let it bleed on purpose because if they had put vaseline on it the flow of blood would have changed direction and gone straight into his eye.|`|fXWXvkzlaa	i can see why you'd say that but it looks like roy jones last fight and he wouldnt of wanted it to end early so just for that i think it was for the best.|`|3p6Nm8AXaa	They would never let a fight like that set up get stopped early!!<br>  <br>  2 legends 1 retiring n 1 making the best come back in boxing!!|`|gASHjXixaa	jahahahaha|`|f922a5260f55297938ecacd54ce76bf5aa	Despite how bad the cut was, and the fact that Roy had little, if anything to give after the 9th round, I personally think it would have been a great shame if the fight got stopped, as it would have deprived Roy the opportunity and dignity of going the distance. Roy would have only protested and insist he carried on. Even though he was beaten, I'm glad he was spared the humiliation of being stopped, and was able to last the full twelve rounds.|`|dKA02Wonaa	IT'S OK SAYING Calslappy is 36,but in boxing those 3 years can make you an old man like Jones was last night.Instead of ducking Jones 10 years ago he should have fought him then,hardly any of Calslppy's punches were connecting,fights like  woman,oh,and Im British!|`|3659ca0e44bf2fec4b4040a064b7020faa	It should have been stopped and gone to the judges after round 9/10 but unfortunately cos it was PPV in the US I think that was the reason the fight continued. Luckily the cut didn't get much worse in the final couple of rounds.|`|RZ8BYlDFaa	Jones cut men should get the sack i think at the end of the 9th they didn't even put vaseline on it just dabbed it with adrenaline.. i think it could have very easily been stopped but its good to see it go the distance|`|MTRtqDJCaa	I think around Round 10 Jones was done.  Calzaghe was doing a great impression of young Roy Jones Jt, stickin his chin out, dropping his arms and taunting his opponent.  I think he should actually retire now before he gets hurt.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://daddysports.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://daddysports.blogspot.com</a>|`|F4UkVvBeaa	roy jones jr in his prime wouldve beaten rabbit-punch calzaghe easy|`|6QhACK70aa	yepppppppppppppppppp sirrrrrrrrrr<br>  it should be stopped but the referee and crowd (american) hoped for a surprising knock out|`|tpSSka4taa	I agree.....The fight should have been stopped earlier.

MTRtqDJCaa	It's a guy with really heavy hands.

Because after you've punched someone enough times your hands tend to swell if not properly wrapped. <br>  <br>  The only time i've heard of this is referring to someone as having "iron gloves" which is a statement made to say they hit hard. Because I can only imagine getting punched in the face with an iron glove!|`|hW57A3hIaa	If they hardened when you closed you hand, you wouldn't be able to open your hands again.|`|4VNcPRMbaa	Isnt it the stuff you use in your gloves|`|JD9Dt4M5aa	idk
s2gRgCZvaa	i'd say the cowboys are the most overrated team. |`|W1sireZRaa	I say the pats because theyve snuck away with some cheap wins. i actually think the cards are pretty because of there explosive offense. they are in the worst division in football though. The steelers are not that great. the offense really stinks to to an overated big ben who throws tons of ints recently. the giants havnt really creamed any teams that are good so i dont think there great and eli is really overrated. the titans are not winning by large margin and could have easily lost a few games. the chargers are not that good. the could hardly beat the chiefs who ar horrible and dont have a winning record but others still think the will make the playoffs thats who i think is overrated|`|8VtfC9PBaa	The colts, they got lucky in the last weeks game against the steelers with tipped passes. The Titans. ill admit their good but not as good as everyone says they are, once they run into a great offensive team that has a good defence they will be screwed. The redskins, they got killed by the steelers back up quarterback and also lost to the Rams who just got blown out 40-0 at halftime and 47-3 to the  jets!  |`|MTRtqDJCaa	I defenitely think the Cards are overrated, the Vikings I think overrated too, too 1 dimensional.

616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	Your question contains an interesting contradiction. You claim that football is less 'tough', but then you complain about the senseless violence of football. You should make up your mind.<br>  <br>  Looking at the number of posts in football (American) vs. rugby the football category has 30X more posts, and each day there is a whiney rugby troll coming to rag on football. This seems to indicate that football is more interesting, and the rugby trolls resent it.<br>  <br>  Please educate yourself about football. It's obvious you don't know anything about it. You'll find that it is a much harder hitting game. Rugby is closer to soccer than it is to football.|`|i8eB91czaa	First off, there are way more hard hits in football, because in football the padding gives a psycological edge, while in rugby they don't have that luxury, so they hit like sissy's. <br>  <br>  As for the long periods of inactivity, football requires a little thing called strategy, outwitting the other coach, instead of something stupid like soccer or rugby which is constant and without strategy. <br>  <br>  And, your just straight up gay for not appreciating cheerleaders. I see why you like rugby now. Its all men in rugby, when you see any women you can't stand it because your such a flamer.|`|QW3tkVt7aa	Personally, I think the lack of the forward pass makes Rugby boring.  The fact rugby players don't have the size or power of NFL players may explain why they don't need pads.  <br>  <br>  One man throws the ball upfield while everyone else engages in senseless violence?  I must not be watching the game.  I could have sworn that the quarterback throws the ball to wide receivers, tight ends, running backs and full backs while the remaining players block defensive players.  I also missed the fact that the ball is passed on every play.  <br>  <br>  More ebb and flow?  Granted, I haven't watched a ton of rugby, but it seemed like people run around mindlessly for most of the game.  |`|qnhi8N8Iaa	THis should answer your question, a football player can do good in rugby, a rugby player can never do good in football, they are both fun,intense, and violent sports,and i have played both. its rare for a rugby player to hit as hard as a football player, they mostly hit with the shoulder and slide down to the legs hoping to trip them up, football on the other hand requires u to tackle through the man, rugby player do need more endurance than football players, but they do not exert the massive forces football players do in blocking tackling and even running, <br>  it may be true that it is at times boring to watch but it is never boring to play, and cheerleaders are hot but do not indicate how boring the game is<br>  <br>  go to the link below and the facts will speak for themselves|`|ME62Mtv4aa	don't hate rugby sucks NFL rules end of story!|`|d2bf1107a84e4ec6c6a00757d4b3c031aa	i understand where you are coming from, i come from strong soccer background, i used to know every player in world cups and thought NFL was just bunch of idiots running toward the football, constantly stopping the game and dragged on endlessly,<br>  however, once i learned the timing and the planning that goes to each single play, i learned that NFL is the most complex sports ever existed!<br>   While it might look like mindless tackling, every single move is preplanned and has to be executed perfectly in order to move the ball, Also think about it,  do you really need tens of coaches for every position to manage a what "seems to involve just violence for its own sake against the opposing number while one man throws the ball upfield"!!!<br>  |`|m9kFC1auaa	hehe,<br>  football is so good.<br>  im from uk but i luv every minute of nfl,<br>  long but worth it<br>  harder tackles, faster players,bigger blockers, u name it nfl has it. rugby, senseless just run from  A to B but nfl get from A to B by outwitting the other team, skillfully manuvering the ball, weaving it through players to reach the reciever.<br>  i luv it when someone gets taken out!! lol<br>  rugby is jokes too tho, is mising 3 things, the skill, the girls in the breaks(dam thier hot) and the hard hits along with the brains to outwit other players.<br>  |`|xHQSWBV1aa	football requires more strength, quickness speed, and oh yah, they are smarter. They memorize over 1000 plays in their playbook.And unless im mistaken you cant tackle above the waist in rugby, you can say using pads is being a sissy, but not being able to tackle above the waist is really pussy|`|DV4RNZg9aa	...so you don't like good looking young girls?...But anyways foot ball takes alot more strategy and  they need helmets and pads because the hits in football are bigger then the ones in rugby, rugby does has big hits but not as big and not as often.|`|Fb4SwLCNaa	I don't know, depends on you interest, what you play. I like tennis and NBA way better. but NFL is okay. Never really seen rugby.|`|jkqy3cDzaa	Well, first off I'm sorry  you don't find pretty teenagers in short skirts hot.<br>  <br>  Second, You are a moron. Go kill yourself,|`|YFtqdvKWaa	Maybe if you didn't hit like *******, then yall would need to use pads to.|`|SKyPhcnqaa	i started NFL recently and im from uk so its not usually played and i came into it so biased on not liking it and ended up loving it i prefer it to rugby myself because they dont need the ball for you to tackle them this question is unanswerable simply because it depends on your personal opinion

He is learning to use his different receivers, and has some of the best receivers in the game.  They have a strong defense, and they have a strong kick in Gostkowski when they can't get into the endzone.  They know how to play the clock at the end of the game.  Last week they had an over 19 play drive which took out over 9 minutes in the 4th quarter.  Not to mention, they have one of the best head coaches/coaching staffs in the National Football League.<br>  <br>  Brett the Jet just isn't gonna get it done.<br>  <br>  Patriots clinch the division, Jets earn the wild card.|`|076i35yGaa	The Patriots, they will need to win at least ten games to win the east.

fAbeTXIRaa	I agree with everyone except for Raddie.<br>  <br>  Of course you can trade Nash for Redd and all those other players he listed, but i highly would not recommend it.<br>  <br>  I also have Nash in my Premier league and know what you're thinking. However, this is only the 3rd week of the season. Once his team gets situated in the new system, Nash and his Veteran IQ will get going.<br>  <br>  However, at the same time, if you can get an Elite PG for Nash, i wouldnt disagree. If you can trade Nash for Deron WIlliams straight up, I like that trade for you.<br>  <br>  Deron will be out for another week, so its considered a buy low situation.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  |`|MTRtqDJCaa	I think you should trade him now while you can. What does the rest of your team look like? Just to throw out some names, you might be able to get Michael Redd, Joe Johnson, Andre Iguodala, or maybe even Dwayne Wade.

This occurs when any part of the defensive player's body is over the line of scrimmage at the moment that the football is snapped by the offensive center.  Technically, if a defensive player touches a offensive player prior to the snap of the ball it is offsides, but that is called encroachment.  When the offense is "offsides" if is officially called a false start.|`|x9kYZ0UIaa	If a player on Team A is on Team B's side and past all of the Team B (the goalie doesn't count) and if he doesnt have the ball, he is offside.<br>  <br>  check fifa.com for the rules<br>  <br>  If you mean American Football (then you have the wrong catagory) but it is when somebody moves before the ball is snaped, so they bascialy get a head start.|`|q9Dw0roZaa	When the Ball is played forward by the attacking team . and is played to the furthest forward player and he/she is Beyond the Oppositions Defender . Then that player is offside ( The Wrong Side of the Defender ) This is judged when the Ball is Played, Not when the player touches the ball . so if a player was Standing beyond a defender, *TheBallIsPlayed* to he/she .. and he runs from an offside position to come back and interferes with play, Although sometimes Officials will allow the game to flow.

ZJtlB6o3aa	Seriously people are so annoying cause everyone hates USC. EVERY BIG 12 TEAM HAS A HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL DEFENSE. The person that said USC would give up 50 to those schools is crazy they would maybe get 24. All the Big 12 teams have great offenses and horrible defenses. Most Big 12 fans are not smart when it comes to football. Just get over the fact that USC has the best defense in the nation and one of the best all time. are they better than the top big 12 teams and SEC teams?  Idk, no one knows for sure, but I can guarantee USC wouldnt getten beat badly by anyone<br>  <br>  im as annoyed as you are man its annoying even posting questions. everyones automatic response is USC sucks. i mean you cant say anything more stupid than that|`|2d4f3713a999f0c1cd26290f44d82f68aa	They definitely look good but lets see them up against a strong offensive team outside the Pac-10 first.

TzhnOvXVaa	are you a girl or a boy?|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	yes , there is a freshmen in college.  Just joking man, anyway , I am a senior and it really depends, yes those times are pretty good.  Well I started running last year and I got my times down.<br>  <br>  <br>  2007-2008                                    2008-2009<br>   <br>  800 meter- 2:17- 2:14                             800 meter- ?<br>  1600 meter- 5:07- 4:41                         1600 meter- ?<br>  3200 meter- 11:11 to 10:34                3200 meter- (10:12 preseason)<br>  5000 meter- 20:30- 18:14                         5k- 19:00- 17:13<br>  <br>  <br>  you see, it is not enough to know your times.  A state champion might pop up his first year in running, what really defines you as a runner is how much are willing to improve.  My times are pretty good but unless you improve , you are not "good."  Work on your times and never be satisfied.  I wish I started when you did, enjoy your time and good training.  |`|dGL5xCrqaa	It's a REALLY good time for freshman girl's 5k.<br>  It could be about right for a freshmen boy's 5k.

Your times posted really don't show consistency in your efforts which tells me your training isn't all it could be.  12:01 is a bit faster than I'd expect a 5:46 miler and 19:30 is too slow for a 12:01 2 miler.<br>  <br>  I'm stepping out here and saying you need to run through some pain, when it get's uncomfortable don't back down. Looking at these times you posted, and I'm trusting you here, I'd say your future is as a distance runner. XC and the 3200 would most likely see you at your best. With an honest effort I see no reason not to be in the 17:00's for cross and into the 10"50'si n the 3200.<br>  <br>  As a coach I would want you to see me (NOW!!!) and say something like "hey coach. I really like XC / Track and have set some lofty goals for myself. I think with the proper training they are attainable." You coach would be happy to give you some workouts.<br>  <br>  For this track season set a goal you think is attainable say break 11:00 in the 3200. By next cross season why not 18:15 ? I've had runner's drop 1:30 minutes from frosh to soph.<br>  <br>  I'm being honest and sincere when I say if you walked out on my track with these times that 2:29 half would put you into my distance runners group on day 1 and I'd be certain to gear your success for XC.|`|rvJhPSaYaa	They aren't going to win you a lot of races but no worries you are young if you stick with it you'll improve.  I'm living proof.  <br>  <br>  In grade 9 I ran<br>  <br>  400m 1:08 <br>  800m 2:37<br>  1500 5:25<br>  5km 25:30<br>  <br>  In my final year of high school I ran<br>  <br>  400m in 48.02sec<br>  800m in 1:51<br>  1500m in 3:54<br>  the mile in 4:06<br>  5km in 14:45 <br>  10km in 31:56<br>  <br>  So don't worry I'm living proof that if you stick with it, you'll get there eventually.  But you have to train year round, have good coaching, show up to practice everyday and be relatively injury free.|`|VemuNjJDaa	I'm going to be honest, nothing is impressive except for your 800 time. If you trained all year you could be really good at that too. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying only do that.

7R0PTZJzaa	Yes. That looks good. You may want to run a little bit more though.|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	what are you training for?  If it is for track then it is good conditioning work.  how many reps are you doing?  Whatever you do just make sure that you improve over time.

We love running and other endurance sports!|`|UMesz9duaa	I like the strength training stuff....its my philosophy on running that a little slower and more distance will benefit you more as far as fat burning....although i cant imagine that you really have a lot of fat to burn......if you run longer your metabolism will be elivated for em extended period of time and you will continue t burn calories for some time after you workout.  so i would keep up the strength training and alter the running aspect slightly.  try running like 8 mph for 10-15 min intervals or just run 3-5 miles at a comfortable pace.  this will allow better fat burning.  if you run a short period at an intense pace you will just produce lactic acid and it is more of a muscle building activity rather than a fat burning activity.|`|XOfJ5txnaa	I would say your Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday workouts are fine, but Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday should change. I would say on those three days off, you should do a light jog maybe for ten minutes because not doing anything for a day won't help. Also, one day of abs won't do the trick probably as fast as you would like it. I do abs 5x a week with at least 4X25 reps of various exercises to work my abs, but the results aren't comming fast. My suggestion is to do abs 4x a week AT LEAST and do a little more running. Also, I recommend you use those off days for a light workout to keep the blood flowing, but nothing thats going to get you sore.<br>  <br>  Overal I say your workout is balanced and good, but I believe you should add a little bit more to it, so you are working out everyday and that you are working your abs more often. If you don't do it everyday, its easy to forget a day and just give up. But most of all, make a workout that you will enjoy and one that you will stick to because that's what will make the difference.

Seriously, it depends on what you will practice on the bag.  If you are into karate, I'd not recommend a heavy bag at all. It teaches you to push rather than explode. I gave up my heavy bag more than 25 years ago. My punches and kicks are better than they were when I used a heavy bag. I explode the target rather than giving it a hard push. Correct makiwara training will give you that kind of power and speed. If you are into boxing or something like that then a heavy bag is what you want. I'd then get one from a sporting goods store and wear the proper gloves, wraps, ...etc. <br>  <br>  P.S.   If you want to know more about the makiwara and how to train with it contact me by email and I'll get back with you.|`|bqIrBR6kaa	Put enough sand first to give some weight and so that the bag won't swing too much.

It makes a big difference.|`|e39d3be041a67553e25acb8d52e3f4a5aa	My neighbors have a trampoline and small children. The youngest children (7 and 9) are not allowed on the trampoline at all. The older children are allowed while under supervsion. They are fine. <br>  I think if you are older (10+) you should be able to handle being on a trampoline as long as you do not act foolish. <br>  That being said, always be careful. |`|rDQepcW7aa	trampolines aren't dangerous. gravity is.<br>  i think all kids should have a trampoline when growing up. <br>  i dont mean one of them padded ones with a net around them either. i mean one of the old school ones made out of 2" steel pipe (rusted cos it's been outside for years) with steel springs that will tear skin.<br>  they've taken the fun out of childhood. everyone's bubble wrapped now a days and all the kids are sh*ts. coincidence?|`|45bbd69a8bbc0dd3bd0028a0ea857fc3aa	So did my mother, but I won that argument. Well tell them you will buy a net. A net covers the edge of the trampoline and if anyone falls or goes too close to the edge it hold you in. It doesn't ruin anything and it is still just as fun/It has kept many incident from happening. Still be careful, if you land wrong you can hurt your neck or back.|`|Zqkcj6Caaa	if there so worried about it then just get one with a net around the whole thing<br>  without the net they can be kinda dangerous like i have had my foot go inbetween the bars and flip off..lol it was hilarious but it hurt and hey things happen.<br>  if you dont have a lot of ppl then ur good<br>  so anyways just get a net around it and ur perfectly fine that way|`|3X3ok4IDaa	I recently broke my arm falling off my tramp, but my mom and dad later bought a net that goes around it, and I just can't stop jumping on that thing! Tell your parents they can buy a safety net too, and to buy a nice tramp, not a cheap one off of Ebay.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope I've helped.|`|O9TKylC5aa	Trampolines aren't dangerous. They are useful in working out. It could be dangerous in terms of accidents such as falling off of it or landing by your neck. But it's not much of a danger. It is whole lot of fun and is useful and helpful to your body (working out)|`|BDViCkaqaa	I used to think the same thing.  Then I broke my back (literally) on one cause some guy thought it was funny to jump right next to me and make me fly up in the air.  I landed on my head, it was a miracle I wasn't paralyzed.<br>  <br>  As fun as they are, there are safer, but still fun things to spend money on.  I'd vote no and ask for a yearlong pass to the local amusement park.<br>  <br>  Good luck and BE SAFE  :)|`|Lz2hWss2aa	they are a little bit, you should not let little ones on but they aren't that dangerous...you might not want too many people on at one time but they are fun. if you are that concerned about it they sell nets that you cane put around the trampoline so that they do not fall off.|`|bQHkFe2yaa	Well, it depend on the type of trampoline you buy.The most dangerous ones are the fully springed ones with no netting.But my friend has one with no springs and a net and it is very fun and safe.Good luck!|`|GWINq3Owaa	not if your careful. i do front handsprings on mine, and i've not gotten hurt. it helps to have a trampoline net though. :)|`|FNqR8zs7aa	no not really but you should tell your parents that you can get a net to go aound it.|`|dyXN0grpaa	No their safe, as long as your careful . |`|S7ttCbXVaa	lol no|`|wqrZomw4aa	its not b/c it has that net around it that stops u from falling down|`|kPsOCP4Vaa	here are reasons y u should get a tra,poline<br>  1. they havfe nets<br>  2. their are limits on how many people can go on<br>  3. i am really reasponsible<br>  4. i will share<br>  5. i will follow the rules for it <br>  6. i will do extra chores for a week to help pay for a lil of it|`|jkWuKjiUaa	yes many of my friends have broken ankles from falling awkwardly or even falling off. Also i have a reoccuring problem with my jaw from where my knee went into it when i did the sit down stand up thing not helped by my friend crashing into me !|`|EWmTsC85aa	As long as you use them wisely. Don't jump from things (like roofs) on to trampolines. Don't do flips or jump close to the edges and don't jump from trampolines to the ground or in pools. Good luck!|`|n1Rhv4s0aa	well i no people who have broken bones from falling off.. but if ur careful then youll be fine. but if u get a net to go with it its really safee..  and its only dangerous if u have like 7 people all jumping going crazy on it|`|Rf5fWezjaa	Trampolines are not dangerus at all!<br>  They are quite sturdy. You just dont want to fall over the edge and land on your face. A trampoline with a net is the safest option.<br>  |`|ZpgSFnwraa	they are not dangerous because i have one and the only way they can be is when u jump like off your deck then it will and it would prob break through counting on how tall it is|`|dDo6x90raa	there are hazards, but the health benefits outweigh them anyway. Tell them you could always get an enclosure. I have went flying off ours into our house after a double bounce...|`|zeIw3KKcaa	Nope their not dangerous at all. <br>  Everything is very secure =)<br>  I've been on a bunch. You can soo much on them!|`|PvI0qCOqaa	I dont think they are dangerous... <br>  they are only dangerous if you <br>  dont have the nets on the side<br>  <br>  |`|usA4DjAOaa	get one with a net around them those are safer but as long as you dont like wild around on it you wont get hurt |`|hPEjwHucaa	if your parents wont let you have a trampoline, jump on them! THEN you will get your trampoline!!!!! It worked for me.|`|7edc4359051969025569199ba4abbd09aa	only when covered in cooking oil, or over a pit of sharks (with friggin lazer beams on their heads of course)|`|9z8Uz4oCaa	it is if you abuse it but otherwise it's fun!!!<br>  hope i helped....rate me the best answer<br>  thanx<br>  good luck convincing them mine never went for it so we go to the neightbors lol!!<br>  thanx|`|nnBAnBOlaa	There certainly is some danger involved, such as there is riding a bike or playing contact sports, like soccer, football, basketball, etc.  Swimming can be dangerous.<br>  <br>  The source has a discussion that compares the safety of trampolines and other activities.  It may help your argument.  Of course since it is your parents money they have the final decision.
6chLhNJhaa	LOL.....|`|fqycKwuQaa	I don't think they will ever be as good as the hawks because they will never have zero rings, since they already have 14 the second best in the NBA. The Hawks are the best team with out any Championships, LOL|`|tl7fd34yaa	lol at first i thought you were the real peaches but, i think te Lakers are already better than the hawks|`|FUoKu13Daa	wow tough question,  let me see,<br>  <br>  yes I think so.|`|dDhTMacAaa	lakers who?|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Don't you mean will the Hawks ever be as good as the Lakers?<br>  <br>  Who has the better record? who has more championships?<br>  which team has had the most MVP's out of those two?<br>  <br>  which team currently has the best player?<br>  who is leading the league in scoring? and who is the second ranked defensive team in the league? (Lakers)|`|7U79WQ9laa	You have got to be kidding.  I do not like the Lakers but they are already better than the Hawks.<br>  P.S.<br>  I like the Hawks so I am not a Hawks hater.|`|N9fUbdwhaa	r u kdding me<br>  you should be asking if da hawks will be as good as da lakers|`|L8bUjthkaa	Which team is "Hawks" ?<br>  Never heard about it|`|1DwwjKmRaa	******* retard|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	They already are... but better!|`|AA11488609	yes, because they already are.
4Vwhfygnaa	He will play tonight :)|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	Thank GOD is right!  I missed McDyess and so did the Pistons he should be able to help them get back on track and he should be able to play as soon as tonight if he's feeling up to it.  I'm not sure though he might need some practice with the team because they have new lineups with Iverson and he might need a couple practices to get some Chemistry going but I'd put him in the starting lineup because of the way the Pistons have been playing!  McDyess is a very passionate player and he's also very good and he might be the kick start the Piston's have been waiting for!  So I'd stir things up and start him!!!!  GO PISTONS!!!!|`|l6RDDidsaa	in a few days probably miss about 2 games|`|qFiamldQaa	i don't know u tell me<br>  |`|XaFYUMRSaa	They need Billups back !!Iverson is not a good fit for them.|`|3c0caaa2a4af31674ac41b5023c3c503aa	TONIGHT, Tuesday  supposed to play :-)<br>  They said he would be suited up so I am sure he will play.
