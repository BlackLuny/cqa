I made the best friends I could possibly ask for.  I also lived at home.<br>  <br>  Just loosen up and be ready to have fun with college.|`|KtR0NstMaa	It sounds to me like you have a hard time making friends and fitting in.  There is nothing wrong with that - it is just you.  As for things changing at college - maybe.  People are more grown up at college but they can also be just like high school kids.  A lot of them still need to grow up.<br>  <br>  Make the friends that you can and don't worry how m-a-n-y you make.  Just know that once you are beyond school and start a job and maybe move to a new town, things do get better beyond school.  <br>  <br>  You may meet someone you want to marry, buy a house, have kids.  That is all something to look forward.  BUT  don't pressure yourself.  Just let it happen.  If you dwell on this it just makes life hard.<br>  <br>  Enjoy life as it is.  Enjoy your family, cousins, nieces, nephews, and friends.  You don't have to have a guy in your life to be happy.<br>  <br>  But having a good friend in your life is a good thing.  Someone you can talk to and confide in.   Just ONE good friend is all it takes.  <br>  <br>  To find a friend is to BE a friend.  It goes both ways.  <br>  <br>  I have a friend that I have been friends with since high school - it is - - many years later and we are still friends and confiding in each other all the time.   One good friend is all it takes.<br>  <br>  Friends come and go.  I've had good friends that have moved away and never contacted me again.  Go figure.   But that is life.  Just take life as it is.<br>  <br>  The best place to meet good people is church.  You mentioned you are going to a christian school now.  Find a church where you can join the post high group while at college.<br>  <br>  I find compassion among church people especially the older you get.|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	It's alright, going to college you get a clean and fresh start. Try to be more  outgoing and friendly. good luck.

Free entry to clubs, free drinks, free payment for dates.......and extended to it's worst manifestation, punishing the hard worker in the form of alimony.<br>  <br>  <br>  SHE WAS A HOUSEWIFE, THAT'S WHY SHE DESERVES ALIMONY. SHE HAD ALL OF HER BILLS PAID FOR IN DECADES AND LIVED IN A HOUSE SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD ON HER OWN IF SHE DID AS MUCH WORK ON HER OWN WITHOUT HER HUSBAND, HER HUSBAND GAVE HER A HOUSE AND SHE WANTS IT, WHILE HER HUSBAND SUBSISTED HER EXISTENCE AND GAVE HER FOOD AND WATER AND SHELTER AND CLOTHING. This is even if the woman cheated and had affairs, or just left due to "unhappiness" as if being unhappy entitles her to pension, retirement, equity, half of assets, alimony which can reach up to $400000 or more. UNHAPPINESS.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	It's a throwback to when women were property and couldn't take care of themselves.  Unfortunately, the law hasn't caught up with human or gender rights.<br>  <br>  And because it's free money, the women's rights community is turning a blind eye.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Women do have to pay alimony as well in cases where they make more money, although there are far fewer Guy Ritchies in the world than Ivanna Trumps. As a previous answerer said, this is a throwback to when women couldn't support themselves.|`|qNMfaJ4Raa	I agree. Alimony is bull. But it's not just men that have to pay it, sometimes women have to pay their ex husbands off as well.|`|3iNobwVraa	I always liked Chris Rock's interpretation.  Go to 1:54 for the bit on ailmony.

Women have to pay alimony too.  It depends on who made more money in the marriage.<br>  <br>  2.) Women are not money grubbing at any higher rate than men.  Maybe the women you're around, but that's your own problem.<br>  <br>  3.) Alimony is only paid for a limited period of time.  Not a lifetime.  It isn't always paid, either.  When each person in the relationship makes about the same amount of money, no alimony.  The purpose of alimony is to keep a husband or wife from getting tired of his/her stay-at-home spouse and kicking her/him to the curb with nothing.  Alimony is meant as a means to give the other person time to find a way to make enough money to support the lifestyle they were used to as half of a couple.<br>  Instead of alimony, my mom kept the house when my parents divorced.  Alimony isn't a guaranteed part of divorce.  And if you're speaking about women like this, it's no wonder she wanted to leave you!|`|CMo0Fh1Zaa	I agree,  women can fend for themselves.   I think alimony should be banned.

It is very expensive ($350.00), and even after the initial cost you will need a cover for it($20.00-$30.00), not to mention the cost of books add up quickly.  Good luck.

And most of the guys in your age group are virgins too.  And that's all ok.  Being a virgin or not being a virgin is not important.

xzMUxGpgaa	Hi there, it does not really matter if the girls are aggressive and beautiful or reserved and what??? beautiful? ugly? average? No, honey it does not matter, because looks don't really play into this, nor does someone being reserved. A girl can reserve herself for the longest of time and then after getting with someone she can still walk away.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do as far as getting with someone and staying in a relationship with that person is to get to know the person by spending a lot of time together, care about the person, outside of the bedroom. If this sounds old fashion to you, it just might be. But on the other hand, is your way working? See, honey, I think what happens so much is people jump into bed with someone and then after a while they start to think about it and nothing solid is there to base a relationship on. And no matter how good the sex is, if you do not have other things in common and care about spending time with that other person, chances are the relationship will not last long. <br>  <br>  So, I say have fun dating. Go out with all kinds of girls. You do not have to jump too fast. Take your time and really get to know the people. Fall in love with someone, before you fall into the sex part of it. The best partners in my opinion are the ones that start out with a good friendship first, because then you know you really do care about being around that person and you really care about them. So have fun and take your time. I think in the long run you will be much happier. Best of Luck to you.  Aunt DeeDee.
C8DOT8Y7aa	Approach the girl you like. Say "hi" or "hey" and ask her a question or give her a compliment. It can be scary, but it's really pretty simple. If starting conversations is not your strong point, read these articles:<br>  <br>  <br>  How to Talk to Strangers <br>  How to Come Up with Good Conversation Topics <br>  Flirt a little! Relax, crack a joke, and break the touch barrier (see How to Touch a Girl). <br>  Gauge her interest. Take notice of eye contact, smiling, laughter, and enthusiasm in her responses. Read her body language.<br>  <br>  <br>  Notice if she touches you more often than what friends do (she's constantly trying to touch your hand or something). If she finds excuses to do so, then you're probably on the right track. But conversely, don't assume that just because she isn't touching you that she doesn't like you. She may be too nervous to touch you yet. <br>  Observe how she looks at you. If she likes you, she will either hold it for a long time or pull away immediately. Either of these could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it means she is nervous but she still likes you. If you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, then this means that she likes you, although she may quickly dart her head in a different direction. <br>  Pop the question. "Hey, why don't you come to the movies with me this weekend?" (It doesn't have to be the movies - it can be anything you're interested in, and that you think she'll enjoy too.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Another good way to ask is "I heard about this movie, _______. What do you think about it?" If she says she'd like to see it, ask if she'd want to see it with you. If she says "As in a date?", don't be afraid to say yes. If she doesn't say that, just make a time, turn up and treat it like a date and she'll get the drift. <br>  Keep your cool if she says no. Respond gracefully, like "No problem! Maybe another time. I'll see you around, OK?" And go about your business - there are other fish in the sea!<br>  <br>  <br>  Another way to go about doing it is to bail before she has a chance to respond. See How to Sweep a Girl off Her Feet. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TipsAsk her when you two are ALONE. Having others around you will stir pressure on her to say yes or no. <br>  Ask her out directly. Instead of texting, getting other boys to ask her out for you, or beating around the bush, just ask her. Even if you're nervous, this will increase your chances. Most girls will admire your confidence if you are not arrogant about it. <br>  Being relaxed and confident is the difference between a comfortable silence and an unbearable silence. It's natural to have breaks in the conversation. Don't sweat it. <br>  Don't be afraid of rejection! Most girls have big hearts and will not let you down very easily, if at all. Some girls agree to one date just because you asked and they're being nice. Don't take it the wrong way, it simply means she likes you enough to not hurt your feelings but not enough that she's ready for a relationship. <br>  When you do approach the girl, try not to start the conversation by a "Hey, can I talk to you?" or a "Can I ask you something?". Don't ask her out randomly, but these lines are giant hints that you are about to ask her out. This would be awkward. <br>  If she says no, just ask "Oh, OK. Is it fine if we're still friends?"|`|y9N3DsKBaa	You did not say why she turned you down. Maybe she already had a boyfriend. Some parents don't allow dating etc.<br>      Just say something like (I think your cute and would like to know you better. Would you go out with me sometime?) If she says yes. Then say (Great when are you free?) Once she commits to a specific date and time. Then ask if she would like to go to a movie or dinner etc. Give her choices.<br>      Try to stay away from yes or no question. Use either or instead.

Patricia wants to be a cook, and Gertrude's life-long dream is to go to San Francisco to be a prostitute. When they have a big fight, Gertrude leaves her. Patricia, heart-broken, goes out to find her, but doesn't bring any money. She, has no choice, turns to prostitution to, and makes a lot of money. In fact, She turns out to be a better prostitute than Gertrude. Meeting years later, Gertrude is extremely jealous. The plot twists when they result in having prostitution competitions. It tears them farther apart and both their lives end in STDs (which are now actually called STIs by the way).<br>  <br>  Great book, sad, unexpecting ending.<br>  Hope you like it!|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Well, you definitely don't want to look like a whore, so make sure to keep your flirting down to a dull roar. And if you want to let the guy know you're interested, I always used to just make more eye contact than usual and just seem chipper and happy around them (no one likes a party pooper). If you make eye contact, it's kind of saying you're interested without really showing it. <br>  The only issue is that guys your age aren't very good at picking it up, so you may need to be a little less subtle if it doesn't work the first few times.<br>  Good luck!!|`|RDwkN1moaa	jr high dating means nothing only whores destine 2 become pregant date in jr high stick 2 ur friends and ur grades 4 now|`|N7qxyIuzaa	Haha  yea im in jhs 2 lol 7th grade i  just start  laughing with the boy and all and start  making jokes and stuff talking  to them and pulling them   away from other people heehee ussialy Idk that im flirting lol|`|95s0Dlg9aa	"Make him think you like him but you really don't"<br>  That's awful!

Be partners with them or talk to them during class. Guy's automatically get crushes on girls so fast. So just play around, trust me it will come naturally.

This is the ultimate form of love. Because you no longer care about what he/she gives you , it is about how you look out for his/her well being , and how you only want the absolute best for him/her. Where you would honestly die just so they may live. which is the ultimate action of love.<br>  well I hope this helps.<br>  if you really want to know the best time to say " i love you " is on your wedding day because you stuck it out till then , and they truly know then that you guys will be together for ever and ever.<br>  <br>  hope that helps<br>  cia|`|VDSHt23Aaa	only say it if you mean it<br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhawDCBv5CQvWOYhqG0_YKvsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307143640AAjS7al">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|BjyXKFpRaa	just say i have feelings for you don't say the l word unless you mean it cause sometime it can Develop into  a fatal attraction.|`|rin6JBSmaa	no, as long as you really mean it!<br>  <br>  now answer my question :]

4m9Hewq1aa	Aw, that's so fantastic! I've been on the cheering squad since my freshman year and am going to be captain this coming year (which I'm incredibly excited about)! Do you have a cheer, chant and dance audition? Make sure you project (I am a bit reserved and quiet but you will learn to put it aside). Never stop smiling! Make eye contact with the judges (if you have them). In your cheer use diction, don't let it become sing-songy. Spirit and make sure your motions are tight and pronounced. I'm sure you will do exceptional! Best of luck to you! -Alice<br>  <br>  Oh, and as far as nerves go just take a deep breath before you tryout and tell yourself "I can do this, I am awesome!" haha, but truly everyone else is in the same position as you.

tp61e25Eaa	The best thing to do is go into the conversation with the perspective of a friend making conversation. If you say to yourself, "I'm going to go out with this person...", you are setting yourself up to be nervous. Once you talk to someone it will get easier. Sometimes you will find that you really don't like the person as much as you thought you were going to, once you start talking to them. Just keep it casual and see where it goes, then there is no need to be nervous at all. If you like the person after you start talking, ask them if they would like to "get a bite to eat" sometime, or something like that. Just play it cool. A lot of us guys have low self esteem as well, and the minute that a woman shows interest, a guy will be at the very least curious.|`|Vv7a31pmaa	Everyone has value.<br>  <br>  Find yours and make it a part of your thoughts about yourself.<br>  <br>  Everyone deserves to be treated well and be respected.|`|x62wDqmRaa	You need to get counseling for your esteem problems.

Why what you said of how she acts around you it really seems like she does like you. I think that she is just shy to admit it. A lot of girls, especially popular ones feel like "it would ruin their reputation" to date someone who isn't popular and if it is suggested that someone unpopular might have a crush on them, they'll try to ignore it and try to not show interest just because they feel like it might ruin their reputation or something like that. It's all very immature, but that's how it is - thats high school for you.<br>  However, while she might not admit to other people that she likes you, it doesn't by any means mean that she doesn't like you. It seems like, by her actions, she does. So I think that if you asked her out then she would say yes. <br>  After a while she won't care what other people think.<br>  I say, she likes you, and go for it!|`|EU7CUy2aaa	well, she is definitely giving you the signs. however, in my experience girls that are really big flirts often like to give EVERYONE the signs, and this can be very confusing.<br>  <br>  here's what you should do so you don't get hurt more than you have to:<br>  <br>  1. it seems like she has a status/popularity issue. the most likely situation is that she flirts with you when the "crowd" is not around, but since you're not "popular" (sorry you said it) she may be hesitant to admit her feelings. So, you just have to boost up your popularity, and it all starts with confidence. You have to be outgoing and don't be afraid to talk to everyone. I know it will be hard at first but if you keep at it the rewards are awesome.<br>  <br>  2. Really pay attention to the signs that she gives both to you and to everyone else. Ask yourself: Does she do/say different things when she is around me or talking to me?<br>  <br>  3. Ask her if she wants to hang out at your house, or ask her to go out for a night on the town. At first you will probably want to go with a group, preferably 5 or so. Really work towards your strengths in this area. For example, if you're good at having fun playing games, have a game night at your house or go bowling. Make it fun, don't try to impress her and just be yourself.<br>  <br>  4. As you get more of a feel for what her feelings towards you are, which will take a while, you will know whether to just be her friend and try to get rid of your feelings for her, or make a move. Invite her to do something with just you and her, and then you'll get the gold!!|`|bUuqOLBNaa	Say hi to her and talk to her more.<br>  <br>  Here are some random facts if my question didn't help you:<br>  <br>  If you have 3 quarters, 4 dimes, and 4 pennies, you have $1.19.

You are obviously the person in this question so it's a loaded question. <br>  I don't know why you're on here for reassurance. I'm sorry but personality isn't everything and you really can't tell from peoples descriptions of themselves, what they look like (unless it's a very detailed one).
CJvHQl5vaa	You can't help but hurt him.  Rejection hurts.  It is a matter of whether you only hurt him as little as he has to be hurt, or if you add some extra humiliation to the situation.  You are obviously a caring individual or you wouldn't have bothered to ask the question, so I assume that you really want to hurt him as little as possible.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to be really direct about it in a gentle but clear way.  Tell him that he is a sweetheart, but that he is not the guy for you.  Don't sugarcoat it because you don't want him to be confused.  You can't help wanting what you want any more than he can help wanting what he wants.  The cold, hard fact is that while you both are very nice people, the attraction is not mutual and you can't help that.  Close by letting him know that it isn't that he is flawed, but it is that you don't click with him that way.  Period.|`|WQ4hXvzmaa	if youll break him no matter what then just tell him|`|BrhVmZoGaa	well does he know you know he like you if ot play dumb ok and if he says anything just act like you don't know anything and he will realize it was his fault for not saying if he does then the best way out of it is be truthful|`|F0FXTK6Taa	be like your really sweet, but i think it would make it awkward... were too good of friends|`|yiR5W3hlaa	tough one...i don't think thats possible

And hypothetically if I were to choose between one loved one and the human race (i.e. the matrix), I would sacrifice my loved one.|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Well as a MAN, I am only hurtful or cruel to the people that hurt me first, no matter they be man or woman. If a girl wants to act like a man and get in my face or try to hurt my pride then I will be cruel and hurtful to her and treat her like a man.<br>  <br>    I'm older than you are, and it's not very  "mature" of you to insult someone who just gave an honest answer to your question.|`|HMzUeqTmaa	never i couldn't do that
KTqdwG3Xaa	She wants to get back with you.
ePFZ5tHqaa	He talks to you constantly, he sweats when he's with you, his face gets red in front of you, he smiles a lot with you, winks at you, follows you a lot and etc.|`|VqAgZB0uaa	well..i guess if he seems interested in what you have to say, if he jokes with you, laughs at your jokes, talks to you, smiles etcetera. but its always hard to be completely sure. you could always be totally drastic and ask him, it may or may not pay off? if you are talking about a specific guy and what he does u should have included details. good luck! :)|`|mbfMYmzWaa	Just watch him while he talks to other people, then watch how he talks to you, and compare the two.<br>  ~If he's the confident type he's going to look you in the eye, and smile alot while doing so during a conversation. <br>  ~If he's shy, he'll probably seem EXTRA shy when he's talking to you and either avoid looking at you, go red in the face, stutter, fumble with his words, laugh awkwardly, or any of those kind of things. <br>  <br>  If you're ever in a group together, the best way to know for sure is to use your periphial vision. Like, don't stare, but see if he directs his words more towards you than the rest of the group, and see if he makes an effort to reply or nod or whatever when you make a statement. <br>  <br>  Try to spend some time with his mates. Chances are if he's the type of guy who's told them about it... it won't take long till one of them slips or at least hints about it to (or infront of) you... just be on the lookout for their clues (laughing, the "hey heyyyy" raised eyebrow gestures, whispering mischieviously, etc.).<br>  <br>  Lastly, if you like him the guy in question- the best and easiest way to tell without straight out asking him- is to just drop a couple of openings and see if he takes the bait. <br>  <br>  Do the kind of things I've just talked about, just do it subtle untill he retaliates (only then do you begin to make it more obvious). <br>  Use plenty of eye contact while you talk, smile, and laugh at him and see if he retaliates. If he does... move on to flirting less subtly. Do something like, gradually steering the conversaiton towards boy/girl dynamics (when it's appropriate) & after a while you can throw in the "well how come you ain't got yourself a girl?"     If his reply is something like  "I'm not at that place right now" or "girlfriends are freakin annoying" or "I don't want to get committed" or something else that sounds like it would make a good "no thankyou" to someone who'd just asked him out... then stop right there- finish the tangent with something like "lol, no joke. Same" and wait till he decides to like you (cause at the moment, it's not going anywhere). <br>  IF on the other hand, his answers something like "well, I just haven't found the right one" or "I dunno, girls just don't seem to...bla bla bla" or "you haven't asked me yet" lol, or anything that sounds like it's not nessicarily his choice- then you've still got hope hun, just keep probing and flirting and enjoying eachothers company till one of you decides to further it or back away.<br>  <br>  The thing is though, the best way to find out is when he wants you to. Because he'll only do that when he's SURE himself, which means they'll be less chance of "second thoughts" or "complications". My advice is to just treat him as more of a "JUST MATE" than a "POTENTIAL". You'll come off as way more attractive that way, and you can decide whether you really like eachother... rather than falling for the flirty versions of one another... which tend not to last long if you ever do get together... which means the relationship's going to be dodgey anyway. <br>  <br>  Sorry it's so long, I hope it all makes sense! & good luck winning him over if that's what you're after. <br>  <br>  :)

As for the other girl, let it go.  She won't believe you anyway; she will find out for herself soon enough.  Whatever you do, NEVER let this guy back into your life in any way!|`|gXIA9yHJaa	I have been in a situation alot like yours. I also made the mistake of getting back with the person after being cheated on. About 2 years later (she in this case) cheated on me again, not being as smart as you at that time I decided to get back with her again. After 12 years and 3 kids together she left me for the man she cheated on me with in the first place.<br>  I can tell you this for sure, if your dating and your partner cheats on you tell that person how you feel and end it, don't waste your life on someone who thinks that little of you like I did. You deserve a person who is dedicated to you and that you can be dedicated to in return. This was a hard lesson learned for both you and me but you have a lot of time ahead to find the right person so don't let anyone get away with breaking your heart like that. Your time is to precious to be depressed and feeling hurt over someone who really couldn't care less.<br>  <br>  good luck next time and take it one step at a time|`|uQFZBcw3aa	Personally, I think its wise to end the relationship.  It sounds like he is a player and you deserve a lot better than him.  When my bf started dating a girl behind my back I was livid.  Believe me, I refused to ever hang out with him.  He lost his chance and its his loss.  He kept calling me, but I never saw him after that.  -snugs- I'm sorry this happened to you|`|vgWtWmXxaa	Your ex-boyfriend's a jerk. Don't ever get back with him. He's such a low-life cheater. It serves you right letting him know what's up. Even if you threatened to let that other girl that he's been cheating on both of you, that's alright. He has no room to be mad at anything. He put himself into this hole. You could always tell him to tell her first before you step in and tell her yourself, though. That could work. But anyways, don't stress about this too much. It's no big deal anymore. Wipe yourself clean from all of this crap. Time to move on and get over this BS.|`|QopX3tDdaa	To be honest I would have told the other girls. No need for them to be hurt or cheated on too.|`|9mcJBaUwaa	This is probably one of the worst situations in relationships, it hurts the other person more than they think. It is wrong for him to cheat on you, but note the fact that no one is perfect, there are millions of guys and girls out there, it is possible that he likes more than one of those girls. But he should have the ability to control himself when he's already dating another girl. There is a bit of chance of you guys going back together, it all depends on whether if you want to go back together or not. I don't know about you, but if it was me, I hate to loose a friend that I've been through a lot with, I would let it pass, not trouble/bother me anymore and move on. Life is about moving on forward, you cannot freeze and stay at one spot forever. Always be calm and keep an open mind. Perhaps he's just not the right guy for you. Take this as an experience, I wish you can find your dream guy.<br>  <br>  Wish you luck! o(n.n)o|`|FS5F3Ryyaa	you did the right thing but the warning signs were there when you were first dating and was told that he was dating another girl then you went back to him once a cheat always a cheat if I was you I would be telling the girl that you went to school with to tell her friend to be careful of him that he cheats and even though you don't know her you don't want her to get hurt like he hurt you  tell your friend to tell her to be on her guard  from him and if I was you go find  some one else there is some nice guys out there ,their not all creeps good luck|`|iJzlRCkOaa	I honestly think you should find out a way to tell Tori, in person or at least on the phone.  There's a sort of thing that women should (and often do) share with each other.  We know that while men can be great fun and all, some of them are really dirty pigs.  Believe me, Tori would want to know.  She'll be upset, of course, but not only are you getting her out of a potentially bad situation, but you're teaching Daniel (scumbag) a lesson as well.  I think that although she might be mad, she'd definitely be happy that you told her.  It's what I'd do, at least.|`|ej6pi4HEaa	interesting... do you always type your love life on yahoo answers?|`|jGKGlxAuaa	Move on, nobody needs that kind of relationship.|`|701e58df5467ec4c3e55497b3558ae74aa	I would walk away and move on.|`|2NRCJgq2aa	You aren't his girlfriend, you're just another date.  If that's okay with you, then it shouldn't matter who he goes out with, or how many people he goes out with.<br>  <br>  If it isn't okay with you - dump him.  He's not worth your time or your energy (and that won't change).|`|cOqVGdL8aa	Well I wouldn't have started dating him again in the first place because by that time it was pretty obvious what type of guy he was. <br>  Otherwise I would have told the other poor girl, and I would ask the guy I was dating why didnt you just break up with me like a real man and stop dragging me along. than tell him when he's done with this girl, at least have the courage to break up with her and not be a pu***. <br>  Than I would say when he got mad that I was going to tell her about me,that he should have thought the outcome of trying to date two girls at once would have been risk of losing both.

I don't mind the occasional pimple cos we all get them! Severe acne can be a bit of a turn off for a lot of people.

QcUkrLWraa	He's just too scared to be mean to your face. Otherwise, this guy is a di*k. He doesn't deserve your affection.

6blfbeTGaa	If she still has feelings for him and you KNOW it and she knows that you know it, then you shouldn't go out with him. Plus he's a player. What's going to happen when he "breaks" your heart? You will find yourself alone. You won't even have a best friend to talk to b/c she went away b/c you went out w/ him.  Do want you feel is right, but I suggest paying attention to your friend's feelings,too...But consider telling your friend how YOU feel and that you really like him. I think she should get him over now...It's been awhile since hte summer. <br>  <br>  key word:<br>  TALK.<br>  <br>  P.S. Since he's a player, he could just be well..."playing" you.

Not to mention you're not even actually in love.|`|5b5e3b4f114d52c05fdb151a2f5b2317aa	Flat out, you don't date your friends ex's. Even if it was twice over summer. If they still have feelings for him, he's off limits. If they are honestly over him, then you can consider dating him, but, until then, tell your other friend to not even go near him because it will make her loose her friend, and friends are there longer than boys are.<br>  And boys are RARELY worth it. The saying bros before hoes works for both genders. Tell your friend she is being really dumb choosing this boy over her friend.|`|9gAaahJtaa	i dont blame ur friend for getting mad. <br>  i was in her position once.
riC03pclaa	there is really nothing we can do. we feel the anguish just as much as girls really, sometimes more because it is harder for a guy because guys don't become attached easily, and when in your situation you were together 2 years, the guy has probably become really attached. it is also harder for us to admit our feelings in the first place before we start dating because we are supposed to be strong and masculine, but when we admit our feelings we break down inside like small children who lost their best friend. i am not sure if that helps but there you go.|`|X1CSZAxVaa	what I do is go out with one of his best friends and like flirt heaps and stuff, it makes him feel really bad and it makes you feel like you dont have to care what he does. eat lots of ice cream :) and watch heaps of funny movies. theres no point feeling bad about it for two long.

We were really good friends, but the whole FWB thing messed it up.|`|2bTeIiUYaa	Do I just count myself or all the friends I sleep with?  I'm 29.
KTqdwG3Xaa	My house.|`|N4ZLMXekaa	Obviously...<br>  <br>  No where.|`|OU8n1EPSaa	the main place? i'd think bed, but<br>  <br>  the floor, the kitchen counter, the pool, on the stairs, on the patio, on your desk at work, the dryer. lol. i don't know. ;-)|`|KDW2tANfaa	i guess the main place would be the bedroom, but that gets boring so every other inch of your house and some public places.. get wild ;)|`|PiWYjEQ9aa	church restroom|`|sGwMKlswaa	at that place over there, you see it?|`|XTSiJBv4aa	That is completely  up to you... usually ... when you are married, and committed to one another, you choose a place together. Usually in your home in your sacred marriage bed. Or, in the shared vehicle of the married couple, or the married couples garage, or their parents home when they are staying their for a family get together.|`|JoitjQRtaa	me and my girlfriend love the shower she gets wild in the shower.  But you gotta have a sparkling clean tub.|`|ItYSaSt1aa	the mailbox.|`|jf1o7TFHaa	i guess in the bedroom, but that gets BORING!!!|`|2dyv62qyaa	in the bedroom
NJMGZ6TRaa	hm, why not ask the girl who cant keep a secret or you could just tell him how you feel directly!<br>  goodluck!! :D
pnCYdBUuaa	Honestly, you let him stay gone and work on rebuilding your life.  The feelings you have for him might be very strong, but he violated the trust in a fierce way and that's not the road you want to start yourself down.  I PROMISE you, there is a man out there in the world that will treat you like you should be treated, that you will love more than this guy, and more than you thought was possible, and that won't begin your relationship by lying to you and disrespecting you.  Stay strong sweetie! Let him sleep alone in the bed he made.|`|CrNE1Aiiaa	Call him back ASAP!  tell him the truth, you probably ripped his heart in pieces. You should tell him the truth but tell him that you don't want to ruin your relationship, tell him to do what ever he wants i just don't want it to be my fault. Tell him right away!!!!!|`|uaHzhUeoaa	First of all, you are seriously thoughtful and kind because personally, i would have asked him to call off his wedding for me. It was a very selfless gesture, and he should appreciate that. I think what you should do next is call him and explain how you feel, because if he loves you and you really love him, it will probably work out. :)|`|QNG0zkQRaa	This story sounds shady..very coincidental that you bumped into him as he was buying her ring, weird. If this story is what you say it is, sounds like drama and I wouldn't get involved with someone who was cheating on the gf, cause more then likely they will do the same thing to you if you get involved. If its meant to be it will happen.
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	I wasn't aware of this...|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	All people do this when they're staring at someone's eyes. Most people can't focus their eyes on two different things at the same time.
K4mmMj6Xaa	Be careful because sometimes things only get worse when you get married. You definitley do not want to be in a loveless marriage. You will only be miserable and once you get married it's even harder to leave. Maybe you should leave for awhile and give him a reality check. If he really wants things to work out, he'll make the effort to change.|`|ZH8APsNwaa	Leave him. <br>  If you stay with him in 50 years you are going to still be complaining about the same stuff only you'll be too old to do anything about it. Life is too short to spend it with a lazy man. It would probably be the best choice for him too, that way he can find some lazy woman who can sit and get fat with him.|`|oB4KxwuJaa	You just need to have a serious talk with him and figure out what you both want to do in this relationship.  If you feel that it is not worth working out then maybe you should leave.  I hope you figure everything out.|`|LRJmHA7vaa	OMG sweet heart, you deserve so much better. It's hard to raise those kids on your own. I know, I did it, and you can too. Please, remember, every decision you make, you make for your children also. I have two boys who thank me every day for giving them the life that I did. Yes !!!!It was hard, but they both know what it means to work for a living and they both know what it means to be loved. <br>  <br>  Give your children the gift of self esteem. No Matter what.<br>  <br>  My children come first and so should yours.|`|akZrlqOqaa	If you don't love him leave him. It is not too late. If your thinking it is the right thing for your kids to stay you are wrong. Being in a relationship where you feel undesired and under appreciated is no way to live.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  Do what it takes. Being broke is better than being unhappy.|`|3ctchU2faa	If your fiance won't go with you to counseling, try going by yourself and see if they can't give you advice.<br>  If he is not willing to change, you might have to face the idea of leaving him, and finding someone who appreciates that you work full time and may need a helping hand around the house once in a while.<br>  If you do decide to leave him, ask your parents if you can stay with them a while until you can find something permanent for you and your two children, or seek social assistance.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	He sounds depressed.  Men are at their best when they are strong, confident and looked on as leaders.  He needs a huge ego-boost somehow.  He needs to feel his importance as a dad and a hubby.  He needs to feel like his kids look to him as if he were a god, which they do.  He has so much to work hard for, but somehow he feels weak and helpless.  Let him know how important he is, how much everyone needs him, and boost him up...and yeah, encourage him to see a counselor.  Take care.|`|qlDV1OZwaa	thing are much harder alone . i am a single perent of 2 . he has become used to you doing everything by the way it sounds . i know how hard it is but try and do not give up because you will always love him even if you don't like him|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Leave him or live with it. Those are your choices.|`|djUMvICoaa	As in all broken love affairs your head is telling you one thing and your heart is trying to tell you something else.  You have to seperate those two things out and listen to the part that makes sense, your head and then follow through.  You don't get to decide how much child support he will pay, the court does.  He isn't going to do anything else to help so you have to help yourself.  It's too bad he feels that he doesn't have any responsibity with the kids.  But easier to get out now than in 5 years from now when you will have been run into the ground.|`|gSxZFp67aa	i would say try counseling. i know in your details it said he isnt willing to go to counseling, but you dont have a choice. i would say you should give it a few months of counseling, because its really hard to go out on your own, work, and support your children. tell him that if he isn't willing to work on the relationship with you, get out. <br>  <br>  i hope i helped and i wish the best for you (:
of9TuRAVaa	ok well in my oppion of course i think you should tell her that you like her. because she might like you since usually all girls do marry there best friends and tell her now so jsut in case there is the chance that you can have her that you dont lose it to another guy and if she likes you more then him then she wont get with him or be with him or she will just start being mroe and mroe closer to you till you know it that you to are together trust me =] hope i helped|`|ZBnvveT3aa	hey what do you know me and my best friend jus got together... he felt the same way i was about to get with some guy when he told me... he pulled me aside and said... hey were bfs right? what would you do if i liked you? so i told him well youre a good guy and i would to find a bf like you and next thing you know he asked me to be his girl.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Yeah while she's with another guy you're going to have to be silent about her feelings; but if they break up you can come a little closer and be there for her in case she's sad about the break up. Start inviting her over and watch movies again. Take her hand, and look into her eyes; smile, then pull her close. After the movie, tell her you have something to tell her.<br>  <br>  I know it's going to be hard to wait but you can only be a friend right now if she's in a relationship; so hang out with other friends or in a big group that includes her and good luck!|`|kFOxlebDaa	I think you should tell her..but not in a manner of trying to steal her away and try to figure out how to say it w/o putting your friendship up
088b2f23da252d7364143178b0433b20aa	One month anniversary is not important. He really shouldn't have to do anything for it. 6 month... maybe 1 year... probably but not 1 month|`|LybMYXsLaa	Just tell him and say something like hey remember i won't be at school on friday and that's our anniversary so do you want to celebrate it when I get back or on thursday... that's what I would do , just act chill about it.
LknYI7FFaa	That's a good start that you don't do drugs, get drunk or cut yourself. It's hard to find a good friend who will not judge you. Just be true to your self. And don't do nothing you don't want to do just to fit in. One day you will find that one person you can trust, talk too, and cry to. Just stay being you, and your day will come to be happy. Good luck, happiness is around the corner.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	I'm sorry I didn't read that and I normall do. I wanted to say one thing to you since this is the Internet:<br>  <br>  BE <br>  <br>  CAREFUL!|`|qT8yID3Taa	i'm sorrry. =[|`|Rj7L1Rc6aa	ill be your friend...i sent u an email so holla back
rY84Ap6Maa	oh my god, shes 88 and ur 17?! WTF?!|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	you're just her boy-toy...
df7WXRl5aa	This is what I am doing to a guy I really like in my English class too! I am pretty shy, but I really want him to come talk to me, or make a move. You should talk to her, and then ask her out!|`|uuJszgCsaa	I used to do this with a guy I liked. But he was kind of a jerk so he used to roll his eyes at me. She likes you and she thinks you're cute and THAT is why she stares. She looks away quickly cause she's embarrased that you caught her looking and she's shy about her feelings and doesn't want you to know that she likes you. DON'T roll your eyes or anything like that cause it will really discourage and hurt her feelings. (especially since you said you guys were friends) Hope I helped.|`|DsXyMuAiaa	She must really like u & doesn't want to let on how much.  This has happened to me before...if I really like a guy sometimes I get really shy around him i can't help it. If you like her too you'll def have to make the 1st move with her.|`|RDdEJFxoaa	she's probably just waiting for you to make a move. strike up more conversations with her: it'll make her feel more comfortable and slowly, but surely she'll start holding eye contact with you.|`|8zfXJxxraa	She Likes u And She wants U 2 make a move|`|p4wdTloEaa	she probably does like you and she just kinda scared to tell you.  If you like her then when you catch her looking at you smile at her and flirt with her
AA12087540	its jsut about how you present yourself if you dont want to be treated like shitt then its up to you to tell him how you would like to be treated cause i am currently dating someone else of another race and its good that you can just see the person not the color so tell him how hw can make you happier as a person...|`|QAGaQUDRaa	What is your question? Do you want to know if we think it's okay for you to to date a black guy? If so, then yeah, of course it's okay. If he's a good person, then your parents shouldn't mind, but you're too young to be sneaking around behind their backs, so don't try to hide it from them.|`|MHfT0EiRaa	If you like him, give him a chance.<br>  You may regret it if you don't.<br>  :)
6cN2sIYcaa	i was that way for a little while too. I've been going out with my boyfriend for over a year and a half. A few months ago i met this guy who i loved being around, but i knew i just couldn't date him cuz i didn't like him that way. I realized that my attraction for him was extremely superficial and that my boyfriend was a far better person than him. It's certainly possible, but you have to think logically about why ur "attention" was diverted.|`|ded67a0b2e7e52c2691947fb4e226735aa	Maybe it means you are not really in love.|`|N4ZLMXekaa	I felt that way when I first told my boyfriend I loved him. Then about 2 months later, the feelings for the other person totally went away and now the only feelings I have are for my boyfriend.|`|2nc9k9BSaa	It means you're not happy with the current relationship. It also means that what you're feeling for the other person you think you're in love with isn't love.|`|easm1TkYaa	No, if you're in love with someone, you should look at them and know you want to be with them, and only them, for the rest of your life!|`|kWyatjbRaa	uhh..|`|IbSwlGsiaa	The answer could possibly be that you are not in love.  Because if you think about it, when did you even have the time to develope feelings for someone else.  Now just being attracted thats a different thing, but to have feelings; I think you have to be real with yourself. keep it real.
B462BQYzaa	i've dated a guy a year younger than me, i'm 26 but i won't date a 21 year old that looks even younger, can you say robbing the cradle??<br>  <br>  furthermore, the reason why girls at that age is easier to hang out with is because of experience, we've had our share of relationships and start to understand what to do and what not to do such as being overly jealous and let our guys go have fun.  However, dating a younger guy even just by a year gave me the sense that the guy is not very mature also.|`|vjnUENK0aa	well, if that's you in the picture,<br>  and if i was older, like in the age range you put,<br>  i would sooo date  you ;]
5DvsxolRaa	i think its good you told him you feel uncomfortable. i would say if he texts you, don't always respond. or if you are super nice and can't do that lol, just dont respond right away. (OOO i just read yoru last comment nvm) if he sends texts again, you can ignore those too right? how many times can he resend them?? make sure that he knows you like some other guy and talk about the guy you like with him until he gets the message. also, you could get someone to talk to him nicely like "hey. dude. she's not interested." i think that this is an extreme case, so sometimes you have to be very very firm.<br>  <br>  answer mine? :D<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AigBP.Ger5wDMVkOcpzptZDD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090307191501AAcmRS6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	Change your number.<br>  Or say you've changed your number and give him some random number.|`|OLZYHo17aa	agree with softball. if you positively can't stand him any longer, just either ditch him or just tell him you don't want him like that. i like the having a friend talk to him for you idea, or find out one of his friends and have them talk to him for you.
jGKGlxAuaa	Sounds like a real winner you've got there. Get somebody who can string together at least a 5 word sentence in an intelligent manner.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	You need to let him go. He's really not that into you.|`|t1giY6ghaa	i think he wants u to be the talker,and the the guy to be a good listener. he just wants u to make yourself sound interestin so he wont get bored, its pretty common in relationships, the gurl want to be the center of attention, tats why he's tryin to get u to be worth being around.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	He might just be a boring person or it might be that he just has nothing to talk about. If it's not working out then find someone who will at least talk to you!|`|FnnyT1mlaa	He's tired of you.|`|s4TMc1vqaa	either he is nervous or he doensnt like you anymore|`|8HM70cI9aa	Well i guess it depends how long you've been with him. Maybe he's got problems in his life right now that he doesnt want to make you worry about him. But maybe he might also not be interested in you anymore..sorry to say. Why dont you give him some space. Try having him call you instead of you calling him. Just see how that goes.|`|lF7oQWk6aa	He probably really has nothing to say so he is a boring guy. Just end it cus he probably won't change.|`|HTbSiEVqaa	Girl, take the hint and quit calling him. I wouldn't even consider that a boyfriend.|`|ikZE1cpfaa	You might've done something to make him really mad.<br>  It sure sounds like it.
e9cgt1cAaa	Hmmm. I like a talkative friendly girl. Not too flirty, but she knows how to keep a guy going. Appearance doesn't matter much to me. It's sorta like a plus, but I'm not dependant on what a girl looks like. I like how they think. Does this sorta help?|`|VxySsVbwaa	talkative and friendly.
2C9jU67vaa	Yes. ( and gorgeous eyes too)|`|wjgVgKJvaa	oh yea! definatley. dont let anyone tell you otherwise|`|xQhRvxavaa	yeah you dont have to worry about your looks at all!|`|VxySsVbwaa	yes you are.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Yes you are...<br>  <br>  And never ever let ANYONE tell you otherwise. You got that, keep that in the back of your head.|`|XYBCQz8Naa	i think your pretty :)|`|rEFHlhmdaa	yea you are and your little bro is adorable<br>  <br>  please answer my question<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArdFQ4rahgIczJ2RmfRzcxTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090302204818AAigK2F">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|yt2zVOZfaa	Very. <br>  <br>  :D|`|asxePXbZaa	yes|`|PiWYjEQ9aa	yes u r but u no but hey gotta look at da whole package
Ti1xO4GDaa	i think if you wantt to get out of it with the other guy then you have to tell him simply you love your boyfriend and will not do anything to hurt him. and do not wish to leave him, the other guy needs to find someone who is available...in my opinion =] good luck!!
jzdDF3Ljaa	it's called pansexual...|`|aLqbrJALaa	..thats just too weird, but I guess you can fall in love with a person but not physically...r u sure that guys not gay and does that other guy like him back?|`|081168f28573ebfa7f89cf91f00a1e36aa	WTF?!?! This sh*t sounds stupid! He's gay!!! He is in a denial mood. Your boy is confused....hell I am confused!!! How in the hell can he be in love with him?!?!?! I don't even know what else to say!!!
Ocovw5JWaa	You don't have to make it awkward by going up to him and saying, "hey, I like you." Don't put that pressure on yourself. Keep it simple and casual at first. It could be as simple as asking him if he wants to see a movie or have having a cup of tea. You are expressing interesting in him and if he feels the same, he'll accept and you guys can go from there.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Hmm....you could always go<br>  "Tell me if you like me, then I'll tell you if I like you." but if he says he doesn't like you, that could cause problems...<br>  <br>  You could tell your friend who told you he likes you to tell him you like him. Once he finds out that you like him too, he'll probably want to say something about it anyway. I mean maybe he'll tell you he likes you too since he didn't know you knew that.|`|db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	Just tell him.<br>  Honesty.<br>  Build a relationship on that, NOT sex.|`|2oH2En8maa	It could help if you got some mutual friends together to hang out and then direct your attention on him. If you preffer a more private encounter the do so. Also, If I liked a girl and didn't know that she knew I did. It would not matter at all if she straight up told me that she liked me.|`|lF7oQWk6aa	Just do it. Tell him there is nothing better that you would like other than to be with him. Or however he will more than likley tell you how he likes you too.|`|ztxkW7WKaa	say ooo somebody told me u like me....guess what???.....I like u too lol|`|7MsIHjKnaa	Eyes contact and tell him straight away. Man think and do everything very much difference from woman. I don't understand them all but I recommend the good way is to let him know just tell him straight away. Eyes are very important, eyes are like flowers that would blossom at hearts of both.
x9vI6z4Yaa	That's a hard place to be... I don't know if I would have necessarily DUMPED him because of that, but I'd be pissed as hell and let him know how I feel, that's for sure.

rX4ti0Nsaa	a divorce runs an arm and a leg but the way the economy is, it'll also take the shirt off your back.|`|xKjecOTYaa	You should start hiding, selling, trading, and/or transferring anything of "desire" out of your name BEFORE the divorce atty's get involved. Trust me... it works!|`|Jq2K3N1Zaa	Well, if you guys agree on things it will cost less. I work at a law firm, uncontested divorced are about 1500. Some are as costly 3000.<br>  I live in Ohio.|`|UUrqECXIaa	I got divorced in Wisconsin seven years ago, it cost me $4,000 for a relatively quick divorce. We didn't have much too dicker over. The more things you have to hash over with the lawyers involved the more it's going to cost you.
qNMfaJ4Raa	I'm from NJ where most people wait until they're 30 before getting married.

AA11299079	Neither... they're both losers.|`|85V6cHe4aa	Neither to be honest,i would be looking for someone with higher standards.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Way would you date someone who is on drugs? I would like a cute girl who has changed.|`|QcUkrLWraa	Nice personality and hot but does drugs. Domestic violence is scary, changed or not, you'll always have a doubt. Drugs is also scary, but I'd try to make sure he doesn't overdose.<br>  But then again, my guy can get arrested and harm me. I don't know, to be honest, I'd rather date neither.|`|pJZBdpehaa	Neither, both sound like idiots, go jump of a building.|`|419b54befe425a1ea6fbb7f00aaf095aaa	Neither one!|`|8P64hgL3aa	It's hard... but probably the hot one that does drugs.. I may be able to help her stop.. But you can't really help a violent person to calm down.. I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night with a knife inside me..<br>  btw looks aren't important at all.. I you really like osmeone, they suddenly become very pretty for you.|`|kYj7pCMIaa	The seconds one, because they said they have changed, but the one who does drugs can turn crazy and could harm you. <br>  <br>  And the first one he can but your while family in harm from the police.|`|hNFtO9vXaa	i wouldn't want a guy that does drugs.. so i would go with the bad boy.. i mean is he said he's changed and u see that he is changed then go for it..|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	Hot and nice personality.|`|IkAtIQumaa	Neither.|`|EvaRsC5Eaa	a.|`|eo0DKI0qaa	cute- whats love without risk?|`|sGwMKlswaa	lol|`|081168f28573ebfa7f89cf91f00a1e36aa	Are you serious!?!?! Neither!!! So you're two choices are a junky and an abuser. You really need to get out more! You know there are guys out there that are way better, don't limit yourself or settle for anything!! Drop them both!!! Oh! By the way my mother always told me that a leopard never changes his spots!|`|94043tRNaa	I would have to say the domestic violence girl. You never know what really happened. You would have to see the police report or something.|`|Fue5b9wmaa	depends on the drugs and depends on how convincing the criminal is.|`|5PWmGqzTaa	Neither. A zebra does not change his stripes, and you can not change a man.

H8lP7debaa	I think he can love two women.  Shame on him for getting himself in that position.  Unless both women are ok with that, then he must choose and that is not to say that either women would or should choose him.  He has clearly proved himself as someone who is not trustworthy.  I predict he will end up old and lonely, leaving a string of heartache in his trail.  I predict that both women will feel sad and get over it, and realize that they are much happier without him and they will go on to find true love and respect in their lives,|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Sure it can be true.|`|CajKowXcaa	erm whats he doing with a wife and a girlfriend?|`|ddWyRjmVaa	well yes, but both of them "hit" a different part in his heart. Like the wife is a reliable family wife. but the girlfriend if fun and exciting.<br>  :/<br>  I think it possible, but hes a jerk and wouldn't deserve either.|`|U2w775zZaa	You know what id love an answer to that too.|`|pvjEOGtOaa	it is possible...but that isnt love.

wybTIqXVaa	Probably because you seem a bit too confident and possibly even arrogant (I take that from what you wrote in your question). That can not only be intimidating, but also very annoying. <br>  And the guys that are anywhere near worth it don't care what the heck you look like as long as you're presentable. They'd rather be with you, not your face.<br>  Don't flaunt yourself if you want a relationship, just talk to the guys. Get to know them. Don't over-the-top flirt with them. Guys are human; think about what'd you want to see in someone else.
lv6xfkIvaa	Wait for him to make the move.. I can't stand it when girls makes the move. and defiantally don't do te third option uless your in fifth grade..|`|VVA3nDTtaa	Go up to him when you're alone and say, "So I really want to kiss you now, would you be ok with that?"|`|nWHNbKIfaa	take charge and kiss him|`|zHqwCYiSaa	Perhaps all you need to do is tell him kissing is acceptable with you and see where it goes........George
XH2o1MM6aa	.Flirt,tease,tempt and whatever it takes to get his attention. As you're already friends talk to him when you can and see if you stir his imagination.Maybe even hint at a movie you'd loovvve to see.He might take the bait.
e9cgt1cAaa	I know what you are going through. I'm in that sort of situation right now. Try doing this, sit her down. Alone. And just talk to her. I mean talk to her about your feelings and your emotions. You are thinking about other girls because you may just feel neglected. If you don't feel neglected and you just want to think about other girls. That's something you have to figure out on your own. But you have to let her know what's on your mind. Communication is the best step to a successful relationship. If you don't communicate then your relationship will most likely crash and burn in your face. Just remember don't forget about school too. Try to balance them both, if she loves you as much as you say then she'll wait for you. I hope this helps you.|`|mWqBMGknaa	JUS TRY TO STAY FAITHFUL..BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY LOVE HER ND SHE REALLY LOVES YOU THEN YOU GUYS WILL HAVE EACH OTHER WHEN ALL OF THOSE "OTHER GIRLS" AREN'T AROUND..THOSE "OTHER GIRLS" ARE TEMPORARY..THE GIRL YOU LOVE IS FOREVER<br>  <br>  REMEMBER THAT BECAUSE IT'S A FACT!|`|AA10928214	so work hard, don't do the things that you know are wrong, and give her you're special love and attention. if you say you love her, then you need to take care of her. That's love|`|SdlEr5zqaa	Maybe you need to let her go so that you can grow up. No matter how much you love someone, as long as there is temptation you will always question yourself. Even though you say you love her, she will know that in the back of your mind you are sexually attracted to other women and it will eventually break you guys up.
otAH6brTaa	Their smile, intelligence, ability to challenge one's limits.  Oops that's more than 1, so let's go with ability to challenge one's limits.<br>  <br>  Think about it: when you are in love nothing can get you down.  Suddenly going to work or school seems fun (with hope of seeing a glimpse of her).<br>  <br>  Even things such as chores seem quick and simple if it's for her, or in hopes of running into her.<br>  <br>  And when you see her in trouble, no matter how shy you may be, you can't help but defend her if need be.<br>  <br>  <br>  So my complex answer revolves around the feeling of happiness a girl can bring.  I know you were looking for one word, but does that answer your question?|`|AA10626566	they can cook and clean|`|VVA3nDTtaa	How they act.<br>  <br>  Also their boobs.<br>  <br>  I don't like um' huge but I don't like surf boards either. I like it when they fit their body.|`|VxySsVbwaa	legs
C8DOT8Y7aa	Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. <br>  Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  <br>  <br>  His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually. <br>  Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company. <br>  Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you, unless he's a bit of a "playboy" who flirts with a lot of girls. See if he uses any of the tricks in How to Touch a Girl, and see if he uses them more with you than with anyone else. <br>  Watch his actions around other girls and see if he treats you differently. Some guys flirt with other girls to get your attention. It gives them a chance to see your reaction. It helps them know if you really do like them or not. The way you can tell that they are trying to make you jealous is that they find little times when they're flirting with the other girl to look at you. His eyes will flick over and look at you. Another sign is that when you leave, he stops flirting with the other girl. That will be a harder one to pick up on, but you can have a friend look for you or something like that. You have to be sneaky sometimes to find out if a guy likes you. <br>  Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well. <br>  Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. <br>  Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't?|`|JeUhOli4aa	He most likely likes you. Flirt with him a bit and he'll probably ask you out if he's not too shy.|`|A5nZFjEoaa	Hm i think he likes you :)
ceVb8qdNaa	its a very good possibility that that is why he is acting like that|`|GegQJNzSaa	he most likely will never ever change. So you need to ask yourself if you want to waste any part of your life babying him and proving to him not all people are bad. You WILL eventually resent him for being what he is. I don't understand why the female thinks she can fix everyone! You are better off looking at new faces that smile back at you and have nice things to say!|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I think that after his father left, he realized that he no longer had a dad and that his mother no longer had a mate to comfort her or be there for her possibly and when he is dating he might be following in the footsteps of his father by turning off his emotions. I don't think that it's because he doesn't like you but I think that the way his father left him, he might not know how to be a man. He never had a dad to learn from and all he knows is that his dad walked out so he might just be bottling up feelings about his father and letting them out in this negative way. But what he needs to realize is that by letting this get the best of him, he might lose you in the process.|`|ePFZ5tHqaa	Try to comfort him and tell him your there for him and he can tell you anything, ask him is anything wrong and stuff .
GrWCIQvJaa	go with your gut.. shy guys are so confusing ... am dealing with one. they act aloof and uninterested which make the girl confuse and think that u don't like her.. which means by the time you get the gut to speak to them they lost interest because your behavior might have been weird to them. it is not what you say that makes them lose interest in you, it is your nonverbal body language u send out to them . so be forward and watch how you act ok * ;)|`|JAKKanVUaa	just be your self,|`|IVPZkJnvaa	Just stick to casual and common topics of conversation, throw in a couple jokes.

Don't keep talking about urself.  I find that to be kind of rude when someone yammers on about themself and don't even bother to give a minute of their time to other person to ask how they're doing.|`|21TogLbJaa	ok the problem i see is in your question TRYING to make someone like you don't work  be yourself and if she likes you that's ok if not move on there is plenty of fish in the sea being shy is a state of mind look in the mirror tell yourself i am damn good enough for anyone and jump right in good luck o see the weird stuff we all say that i know i invented that art of conversation|`|WfnbN8ASaa	Don't try so hard. Just be yourself. Let her do more of the talking if your shy. Maybe start up a conversation with a how has your day been? and what not.|`|d1y2Z62Yaa	Just introduce yourself and ask her name. She is probably just as shy as you.
KTqdwG3Xaa	It is time to move on, so sorry it's over.|`|pJZBdpehaa	Time to play world of warcraft.|`|NCvX4I0baa	Define "Long time". Depending on how long it has been it could be time to move on or it's just a phase. But by the way you asked this question I'm guessing you already think it's time to break up. And by the way you said it's been "a long time" I'm guessing you don't want to hold on.<br>  <br>  Do what's best for you. & maybe letting go is what you both need. You never mentioned you loved your boyfriend either so I'm guessing the fire has died and feelings have fade.<br>  Move on.|`|rYzxfrnnaa	You are correct in your assumption. Unfortunately, once we start behave in a certain way, it will only gets worse. You have to make sure in the relationship that things are going good all the time, you have to actively work on it. This is the way you guys choose to communicate with each other. You already think it is permitted. Get out of this relationship. And next time work harder and not allow your relationship to go into this direction.|`|LXherojjaa	you guys just need a little break thats all becasue me and my girlfriend have been together for 1yr and 10 months and we have had our times but it got better after we spent alittle time from each other and now it is going great so dont give up to easily if your really like this guy just spend a little time away from each other for a couple days and he will be coming to you like no other|`|IkAtIQumaa	Only you guys know that. Maybe you guys just need a break.|`|5PWmGqzTaa	Oh good gravy, if you the question came into your brain, you should probably act on it. If you ever think "should I break up with <blank>?" you probably should! Sorry if I sound agitated hun, but to many girls ask that question.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	a relationship  to keep are those that are worth it.. but sometimes it falls in routine and everything gets boring and frustrating.. maybe is time u two take a break from each other..but if u feel is time to move on then do so... good luck|`|ePFZ5tHqaa	No relationship is perfect every relationship has it's ups and down you just have to deal with it don't give up so easily.|`|FcDKhpVcaa	Break up!<br>                       Dr. Casey|`|lv6xfkIvaa	Yeah, relationships don't have to be like that..|`|W9wRSEOQaa	do not pass go do not collect $200 just move on!!|`|5DvsxolRaa	go find someone who is happy and makes you happy as well :D
CjEtAJP2aa	First give her some time to be accustomed to the breakup if it has been recent.<br>  <br>  If it has been awhile...send a funny card, saying while things didn't work out, she is great and you'd really hate to lose her friendship.<br>  <br>  If she really doesn't want to remain friends, back off, in a few years things may seem different to both of you.|`|KTqdwG3Xaa	Forget her, she does not deserve your time anymore.|`|AA10928214	why bother? who cares, move on, find new friends

25mllixyaa	Try talking to her. Tell her that insulting you is a lousy way to get attention. That's all that's she's really doing. You don't need people like that, they are a waste of time and energy.|`|AGCIMZWZaa	Your friend is not a really friend anymore she is a flip flopper backstabber I say you take him/her and ask hey whats up? why are you doing this confront her let her know HOW you feel your friend is a total ***** and if you say crap about me our friendship is over...tell your friend straight up it takes courage but I believe in you.|`|hNFtO9vXaa	ignore her..stay away from that backstabbing b****
w7aHSXCIaa	Well, to start with, get to know her better. A girl usually doesn't like it when a guy they barely know asks them out on a date. Take it slow if you're not ready, and just become friends. Then if you feel comfortable, take the chance and ask her out on a date. You'll  know what to do from there.<br>  <br>  Hope we've helped!|`|SCff9vNBaa	do u wear  glasses,have braces, and get really good grades?<br>  becuz if you look sort of ugly, then you can get a totally new makeover.<br>  she might notice u more and then u guys are bf and gf. good luck!
GbzxnGcIaa	Obviously,you do have some issues that needs a clearer explanation from him to resolve all the issues that going on in your mind.Well.I wouldn't say it is that serious though since all the things that you found are just his unsent letters to his previous crush.I wouldn't think that still shows he has feelings for that girl because he could probably keeps those letters for his collection of memories.What I'm trying to say is,those stuffs are kept just like that and it doesn't mean that he wants to start it all over again with that girl.<br>  <br>  Plus,he confessed to you that he never dates someone before and told you that he already get over her,right?Well,this shows that he wants you to get rid of your insecurities about his previous relatonship.Doesn't mean he wants to make you as a rebound since he treats you really well and entrusted you with his belongings.Just remember that you're the one for him now and maintain that.<br>  <br>  P/s:If this issue really bugs you,have a private chat about this with him and make him clear about your feelings about this stuff.Take a gentle approach and you'll do just fine.Hope I helped(:|`|Ti1xO4GDaa	i really think you should talk to him about it. because if you don't it's going to be looming in the back of your head until you finally do clear it up, get it out in the open and clear things up, really listen to what he has to say. =]|`|xLjzwcPmaa	just tellhim|`|zYXkPwhHaa	Your just another psycho *****, stay out of our things, im so sick of chicks digging through or crap|`|hnGZSRRnaa	Dont think you are a rebound because it seems to me like he likes you a whole lot! If he treats you like you have been together for years then he obviously wants you for you. not as a rebound. You shouldn't bring this up to him because then he would be wondering why you went through his stuff in the first place. And that kind of stuff ALWAYS leads do losing someone. And if they weren't sent then maybe that was his way of getting over her. I've heard that is one way to deal with losing someone. Write notes to them telling them how you feel. Just dont send them. And getting over a highschool relationship is hard so maybe he needed to write those letters. But i believe he truely cares about you. Just dont even worry about it.
cHBcR0Chaa	you have to beat him to the punch, you set the scene. kiss him, or make out with him on your terms that way you know its the right time and not awkward. and just have fun with it. sometimes making out or kissing in front of a lot of ppl is really exciting.|`|VVA3nDTtaa	If you pull away and make a big scene it would make it really awkward.|`|AmFLzUxvaa	Noooooo. If he leans in to start "making out" in front of people you dont want to watch.. then just lightly and politely decline and smile and say "another time" or something so he gets the hint that you want to (if you do), but nows not the time:)|`|QYXFai9Kaa	You may decide when to permit him to touch you or kiss you. till such time you have made up your mind, you may keep a safe distance.|`|uTmQNzpCaa	I say you make the fisrt move before he chooses to kiss you in the wrong place
RJWcgTZaaa	I would say, don't let it bother you.  This is called "puppy love", and most likely, it wouldn't last to the 11th grade.  He probably thought you were boring, plain, and didn't move fast enough.  I would also venture to say that your friend is a little more risque than you are which is probably why he likes her.  Your friend is insecure.  This is why she has indiscriminately hooked up with the guy you were (or weren't) dating without the girl to girl courtesy conversation.  She's selfish and doesn't rate your friendship above her social status.  There are plenty of (uh, hem,) gentlemen out there.  Forget this dude and find your next hot minute relationship.  As far as your "friend"... if you really want to continue your relationship with her then just act like nothing has happened.  When you graduate and discover the real world...you'll laugh in reflection.|`|Ts5WEoSXaa	tell ur so called 'best'friend how you feel<br>  after this she doesn't seem like a trustworthy person; she didn't even tell you who she was dating, which is a really big thing in a person's life<br>  I know its difficult to cut a 7 year friendship...but i've known longer friendships that went sour...sometimes its the right thing<br>  this seems like a wakeup call|`|3ds57CXcaa	just forget about it then. <br>  you too have been friends for too long to ruin it over a stupid guy. <br>  and i mean he is not worth it if he is going to say one thing one day and then another the next. <br>  would you really wanna be in a relationship with that going on all the time.<br>  and if they are happy together, and even if you don't want too you should be happy for your friend cause that's what friends are for. <br>  cause remember friends are forever and boys are whatever.|`|1FgGhZMMaa	which one would you rather choose?  your friend or your " boyfriend"<br>  i think if that boy is not going out with you anymore, break up with him, don't waste your time. if you think your friend still piss you off, i suggest you talk to her.|`|lIiUOwMNaa	slap ya bestie in da face and kick da guy in da nuts PAY BACK|`|pdqJjvrwaa	tell her<br>  <br>  A man who use dont no should never become as omportant as your friendship|`|Vv7a31pmaa	Talk to her or let it go.<br>  <br>  I would just let it go.<br>  <br>  Just don't go crazy over this.|`|FKR45WLPaa	Wow, I see why you are angry.  But, you know some of the blame lies with him.  If she liked him long ago, and saw a chance with him, I can't say that I am surprised that she took it.  Clearly he wasn't too serious about you, and he probably isn't too serious about her either.  Explain your feelings calmly, tell her that you don't want to end the friendship, but you just want to keep your distance for awhile.  Make it clear that it isn't about him, it is about the fact that you were the last to know, and that was wrong.  Give it some time, if it lasts, be happy for them.  If it doesn't, it is a good lesson learned for both of you.  Hope you feel better.|`|IyEJfHGSaa	Does the guy really like you??  If no then i tink you should move on. No point on u liking a guy who doesnt love or like you.<br>  Would you rather lose a bestfriend or a guy u like (whom u're unsure whether he's really into u or not)<br>  If the gurl is your bestfriend and she knows u like him... Y would she want to date him..Its like betrayal..Is she really ur best friend??|`|sdfGtlj4aa	wow well i would ignore them unless u really like the guy then tell her what he said to everyone and idk im very shy so i wouldnt do anyhting just sit back but if u were out there just telll them(or have someone else do it)|`|8c6862a271d7f95609a6595669ffda82aa	''''|`|9OOEDh6daa	lets put it this way..your so called "bestfriend" is lying say her and this boy never dated, why would she hide that information from you? bestfriends dont do that, you need to have a face to face convo (because if you do it on the phone and she gets mad she can hang up, texting/aim/messages she'll be a bX and show people) talk to her about this boy and her, and if she admits to going out with this guy and lying about it tell her to tell u everything if she says its not true and all this bs then she isnt a true friend and try finding better ones (you dont have to STOP being friends just dont consider her as a bestie) also if you really wanna get back at her- go after the guy - give him the best ONE night of his life- but thats only is she says stuff that really gets to you and is SUPER rude/starts drama. <br>  <br>  other then that, just tell her what you feel and how much you dont want ONE STUPID BOY destory 7 years of being friends. <br>  <br>  :]<br>  good luck<br>  <br>  ps. boys are NEVER worth this stupid BS.
TphxwASlaa	how old are you  ? it doesn't say but  If your old enough to leave home you must almost be old enough to be on your own....either way you don't have a right to tell your mom who she can be with... that is wrong...  to stay away till she gives in and gives you what you want  is wrong ... makes you sound like a spoiled brat who is trying to manipulate your mom....<br>  <br>  if the man did not beat you or molest you than you have to back off...
QcUkrLWraa	He might want to see you in a short dress because it's a bit kinky and it might look cute on you, but he might just be a bit surprised at the picture because it's a bit ... sexual, like one of the answerers said. He probably didn't expect it of you, and is probably not ready for that step. Take it a bit slower, and stick to clothes on. It's also a bit random, so he might be like, "okay?"<br>  Don't do foolish things like that though. Personally, I'd be a bit embarrassed.<br>  I'm not trying to be rude or anything, though.|`|zB7Gz8R5aa	Depends on the guy. There is a chance that no he didn't like the picture, in which case you shouldn't take offense to it, doesn't mean he doesn't like you.<br>  <br>  There's also a good chance that he likes it a lot, is just worried about what to say. Even if he's not shy, he might worried about coming off the right way, as in he was turned on about it but wants to be a gentlemen about it.<br>  <br>  There's also a good chance he is just being a dumb boy like the rest of us and doesn't realize how much you want him to say something about it, you can try asking what he thought, but don't pester about it. If you don't get a straight forward answer, it's that he worried about what to say about it (again, either liked it and worried about what you will think of his response, or didn't like the picture but doesn't want to insult you).<br>  <br>  I always say if you can't ask a question to your significant other your relationship has problems, as long as you aren't burdening the person.<br>  <br>  But that's just me, I could be way off.|`|su37vnIXaa	that is really odd & stupid of you|`|707gOCvbaa	Maybe he was with someone else and did not want them to know he just received a sexy pic from his gal. Sending him pics like that will not help him but only make him worse. You tease him over something he will not see for a month? tsk tsk.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	If he didn't say anything or compliment, He didn't like it.<br>  If I was you, I would refrain from doing such a thing again.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	It WAS odd and stupid....|`|x81a2NXAaa	He prob. thought it was strange..<br>  but i could  be wrong I am no mind reader.<br>  <br>  answer mine please..<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgbRoNSsk1VAPsRW9g5EOwXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307194732AAcnYtd">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhRxW5nsKGyhkwN6SnZ5UPrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307195323AAiM4i8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|prW1i0vzaa	Well, most people don't like to comment about other people.<br>  <br>  For example, a guy I know in California gave me his picture, and I didn't reply because I didn't know what to say.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it.|`|u52vyE3raa	Nothing wrong with a leg picture.<br>  Maybe he jus wasn't impressed.<br>  I know i would respond if i was impressed by a pic sent to me.|`|T2NK9u9maa	he might have thought it was a close up of a tarantula eating a butterfly|`|nuBix8sVaa	dont send pictures of stuff like that to guys...<br>  just dont do it..<br>  theyll end up in everybodys elses hands..<br>  trust me..<br>  i seen it on dr phill lmao|`|Lg6Y8HdZaa	he may have been shocked since it was a sexual thing to do.|`|NJMGZ6TRaa	idk,probably he was just shock?|`|axylPYftaa	of course he would like it, what guy wouldnt?|`|oOU6XJOqaa	If this is a new thing, i think he is just surprised. If it is not a new thing, and he has seen your legs b4, he is getting bored of the same pictures, and no action. If you want to continue this relationship, i suggest getting a little more creative and taking more attention drawing pictures. Go Crazy|`|qeF8AN7Jaa	That is a bit odd... did you send any text with it, or was it just like SUDDENLY LEGS?! Next time you might just wanna be like "So I remembered you wanted to see me in _____...." with the picture, so he's not shocked with surprise...|`|uygKFI9baa	Probably not, I bet he just didn't know how to respond. As a guy what are we supposed to say "Thanks" "Nice Legs" the response seem awkward and forced. Its like your fishing for a compliment. I am sure he like it.|`|sJTPzFdlaa	Yeah. Guys arent interested in pics of lower halves of bodies, they want a full view.|`|7ff93384150a84022f12b48eda390e79aa	He's busy sending it to all his friends. Since you are far away he is not afraid of the consequences.|`|J7fH52q4aa	Pe patient. He just didn't recieve it maby.. yeah.. Try asking him allot. it might help|`|SdlEr5zqaa	Don't question yourself, question the guy. Maybe you need to get rid of him!|`|RVlkauBRaa	Not nesicarally (sp?)<br>  He might have not known what to say lol|`|QuighYdGaa	maybe he was just like wtf or maybe he did like it but was too awkward to sae so????|`|a4cW6t50aa	i think hes just so surprized dont wory im a guy and i think he liked it|`|8oovDGZgaa	id have to see this pic to know how he feels
4m9Hewq1aa	"Everything we know is just a story that we've made up to help us organize this reality anyway. And since it's only a story- feel free to change it at any time." <br>  <br>  In society we yearn for the approval of others. We base our own opinions, fashion and daily choices off of other people. Most people trust opinions in masses, as oppose to individual people. We must have faith that our choices are correct in nature (as they are influenced by others). Personally, I believe that the best decision is one made by your own heart...you can never go wrong. Everything works out in the end. -Alice (16f)

Don't jump off the bridge just cuz everyone else is.|`|J7Tw6Tcraa	13|`|4712f79c3b66a688114af1fc7e707671aa	Anything between 13 and 17 is fair game. I know girls who've lost it at 13, and I've known them who've yet to lose it (and I'm a Junior this year lol) Same goes for boys. A few of my guy friends are virgins, but I've known some who've lost it when they were young.|`|zth3G2b6aa	17?|`|fsxFebCOaa	These days sadly its 14 to 15|`|h1omg1IPaa	i was 16|`|VAUK7KYKaa	I think it's 16-18. I'm a virgin and I'm 22 going on 23 this year and I have no problem with being one. I think if you can go without sex - it shows maturity and patience..Not only that, but its silly to have sex before marriage. The whole point of sex is to create a new life with the one you love..|`|WrWcMPMcaa	In these times its about 14 or 15 but im almost 15 and still haven't even kissed a guy so. but in my town this is pretty much how everyone is. still i wouldnt push it.|`|bsWp0pcLaa	Well I Lost Mine At 14 Years Old-Im 15 Now & Pregnant.<br>  <br>  Most Girls Tend To Lose There Around 14-16 Now Days<br>  & Guys Seem To Lose Theres Around 12-14.<br>  <br>  But There Really Is No Average Age Just When Someones Ready|`|SOsoZgUIaa	i was 15 years old when i lost mine... and ended up being pregnant at the age of 17... <br>  <br>  but i know some girls that lost theirs when they were 12 years old by being forced by their (14-16 years old) boyfriends...|`|qeF8AN7Jaa	I believe that it's 16.4 for both...

4lL34wJnaa	That's the date the ring was graded or evaluated.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes the value of a particular ring can increase (or decrease) depending on how the value of the stone or metal it is made from fluctuates.  The value can also decrease if the stone is chipped or scratched.  That date means that the grading summary you received was true as of that date, but may change in the future.|`|iN27E3WCaa	That's probably the date that the stone was graded.|`|uTdEdpAeaa	the date is when the stone was graded (when got got the serial number) thats all.

HSADGmMMaa	The first 3 things you listed are what good friends do with each other all the time. The other things are not important because they are what other people have said.|`|noGTQvFYaa	just ask him<br>  <br>  i used to have da same issue but turns out he just looked at me like a friend only! and i was like oh........................ my bad
NSKimt1Qaa	I'll have to turn this around and have it read "If my husband were invited backstage at a concert for his favorite female band -- & I wasn't -- I would let him go.  I wouldn't care, but probably wouldn't care about the free passes for the next 20 years, either.  Maybe I could sell 'em.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	i hope my man would cause i would love to make out with justin timberlake!!!<br>  <br>  seriously, if i had a chance to kiss my celebrity crush, i would in a heartbeat. i would tell my man too.  there is NO way in hell that i wuold be able to resist, with him there or without him there. just a kiss. ahhh...i hope dreams do come true|`|YzObEmUqaa	You should know the backstage drama<br>  Hens love rock stars<br>  and rock stars usually get what they want<br>  Behind the scene....If you know what I mean<br>  If you don't mind your wife be one of their toys....|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	Good God grow up.  Let her enjoy the moment getting autographs and shaking hands.|`|NYQhhNbzaa	Give a man and inch and he will take a mile.... <br>  <br>  Wishful thinking Eddie, wishful thinking.  lol|`|DlCcFu1eaa	If you want a free pass to do what you like why did you get married?|`|BUET39wmaa	grow up Eddie!|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Of course I would!  And, it would not give me a free pass to pick up women, either, because I know my wife would get autographs and talk, but it's not like she's some drooling groupy, for pete's sake!|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Wouldn't happen!|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Sounds like a plan to me.<br>  <br>  It's always good to bank stuff like that?|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	if my husband got a chance i would say go for it
NYQhhNbzaa	I would be impressed, but not turned on.<br>  <br>  If you were washing the dishes in a pair of hip hugging jeans and were shirtless with suds up to your elbows, now that would be a turn on.<br>  <br>  Vacuuming  wearing a pair of shorts (no socks) with a light sweat building on your brow, that would be a turn on... its the motion of the to and from.... ;)<br>  <br>  Fixing stuff and moving objects are in the job description,  not something that has the WOW factor going for them.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	You really have got to be kidding here. You want your wife to be turned on by you doing your husbandly chores?  Come on now, youd think you were doing her a favor and she should be grateful and turned on by it. Do you get turned on when she cooks, does landry, or even cleans the house? Probably not. Now maybe if you looked like Arnold or something she might  like to watch your muscles ripple but really come on. By the way,these arent exactly "manly acts" here. Now if you were to slay the neighborhood dragon she might think otherwise, but then that might be beyond your "knightly" capabilities, Prince Charming. But be careful, you just might be turning on the guy down the street with such "manly" feats|`|e1oky4jSaa	I don't know about your wife but it turns me on to see a man do those things. I have to beg my husband just to supervise the 15 year old mowing the lawn.|`|2YX18RE2aa	It would probably work better if you did not complain of back pain after.|`|AA10684513	I can do all that stuff myself so no it wouldn't turn me on.|`|uF5Xgtgraa	Can you come over to my house and show my husband how it's done?<br>  ;)|`|AdeD0xMuaa	It would sure get me hot and bothered.|`|Ag8pE3Cyaa	I'm more impressed by a man with a dish towel in his hands.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	Well, not everyone is the same. That obviously doesn't do it for her, maybe ask her what does. I don't see what having a father figure growing up has to do with it. <br>  I think women get turned on by men who do "manly" things, because the man is taking control.  He's "taking care of things" doing something the woman can't. It's hot to watch your man hard at work.|`|NW3L2QIOaa	I think if you clean the house, did the laundry, and dishes; she would be really turned on.|`|nbv6Z01iaa	do you think sweat is sexy?  I sure don't!  Does your butt-crack hang out when you are bending over.  That isn't a turn on either!|`|16827288a6ef61faf9d2e2c99f7102edaa	i like my hubby better when he vacuums or does laundry. it's all manly 2 me.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	Do you get turned on whe she does the dishes?|`|VjMyHAWraa	Being a woman that grew up without a father, I'll have to say that really doesn't have anything to do with (it in my  opinion). She probably just sees these things as things you are supposed to do. I'm sure while you do your thing, she's washing dishes or doing laundry or something! It's called household chores! Try turning her on by bringing flowers or taking her out for a romantic dinner! Now that's takes effort and thoughtfulness!|`|NSKimt1Qaa	I'm not sure.  I was never impressed by my husband doing those things, either, and I had a father growing up.  I thought my reason was because of the poor relationship my husband and I had, and the fact that he never looked or acted sexy doing those things, but maybe it's normal.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	I do that all except for the lifting 200 pd objects and sometimes it does turn my hubby on. You would think I would invent things to fix with the problems we have, if it gets a positive reaction.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	If need some appreciate you can come over and bench press my couch.. I need to vacuum under it anyhoo!|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	your wife doesn't know what she is missing , you can come to my house any day and do that ,, and wow,,,
4YK4tBW5aa	I don't find that very appealing, I'm much more turned on by just a simple sexy bra and panties.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	Because they get the movie version of what a hooker might be dressed like. Most men prefer to open the package and then see what is inside as it prolongs the effect and increases the anticipation.|`|YTasscmKaa	Elle, its all about the feminine mystique. Women's sexy undies are so different than what men wear that men find them fascinating and a real symbol of female sexuality. Men as all about the visual and anything that makes for a more interesting picture is going to catch their attention. Would I rather see a woman in suspenders and stockings than naked? Sure!|`|AA10266072	It looks sexy.  When a girl is naked it leaves nothing to the imagination.  If she's covered in something sexy like that it leaves an opening.<br>  <br>  And as far as men not making an effort.  What kind of sexy outfit would you want to see a guy in?  A pair of those elephant trunk cut out banana hammocks?|`|gqHy3821aa	Stop describing it you're making me hard haha. :D<br>  <br>  I dunno, i only prefer it when you can see the goods haha. Sorry for sounding shallow here. But yeah, i guess it just looks more seductive i dunno how to explain it. Sorry i weren't much help.|`|1fd011c04b7013be44a3fd5dc118bf7baa	it's very sexy and different|`|cyFqjkolaa	Men are visually stimulated.  So an erotic outfit is a turn on.  And yes we hope from there we will get the whole show.  The outfit helps to fuel the imagination.  The brain being the largest erotic organ of all.<br>  <br>  As to dressing for women for the most part you guys do not seem very responsive.  My wife loves the jeans, no shirt and sweaty look but then does not want to touch as all sweaty.  So what good is that.

"lame or cool?"<br>  <br>  I'll be contrarian and give you a gray answer then.<br>  <br>  I couldn't care less. People shouldn't give out their addresses or photos, because that just gets them stalked and raped and etc. Which is stupid. <br>  People can do what they want though.|`|MA8AUiQYaa	well i guess its ok as long as you don't give away your address or phone number or any Personal Information hahaha.|`|IGAx1FgEaa	i think its okay... i do.... i just make sure i don't give out any personal info and ****.... its fun 2 talk 2 someone other than the ppl in ur city/state sometimes|`|tDgXiWkUaa	Online friendship is not trustworthy
uBssj3Znaa	If he talks sh*t about you, he isn't a friend. You should just stop talking to him in general and then your feelings will stop being hurt.|`|4be98dd607dfed9ad18400ef02923955aa	Talk to him about it. It wont hurt to ask him some questions on why he's doing so. Also relize dont fight fire with fire it makes things worse and doesnt help the situation,you can even ignore him for a while till he cools down cuz maybe he's have a hard time. Otherwise if he dicides to be a jerk and not resolve the situation then maybe its time to cut him loose. :/

Don't date them both, unless they both are okay with it. kay? I understand that your girlfriend and you aren't on the same page, but go talk to her. You kinda owe it to her, due to the fact that you guys are in a relationship. But, I think I see your side. Just think about it, and descide.|`|Kk9f3MdRaa	if your GF told you that you should not be so into her than chances are she is ALSO seeing other guys. It doesn't sound like you are doing anything wrong. You should probably make sure to keep the no sex rule until you are with only one girl. That would definitely help keep things less complicated and easier to sort out.|`|IWzYB44raa	You are just complicating everything yourself.

I'd pick girl number 2 if you asked me.|`|RKHYrsP0aa	look dude honestlii ur totallii rite hunzz **** if she dont feel u then u gott everyrite=)|`|vhckzH4Qaa	no, thats now wrong at all. I think that if a girl cannot commit herself to a relationship completely by being able to tell you she likes you, then maybe its not worth for you to put into the effort. I think that maybe this new girl could be a good thing for you and it will also make your ex girl see if she really likes you or not. I say dont sweat it cause no matter what you will have a girl but i think maybe you should look into dating this new one cause she seems truly into you unlike your ex who couldnt commit.

aDIPIu7xaa	Pay the entire rent and be broke until Friday.<br>  <br>  If I had to choose, that is what I would do.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Pay the rent. <br>  You can still eat but most land lords require a 10% late charge.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Well, today is Friday so you should be good to go ;-) Actually, I would pay $900 now and the rest next Friday. Assuming that would be enough to get through.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Pay rent first.  I am pretty sure you squeeze $10 or $20 from somewhere.  Even not, still you do not want the landlord knocking on your door for this.|`|WgOJQGDcaa	Pay rent|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Call the landlord and notify him immediately.  You could also perhaps arrange to pay half now, and half next week when the next paycheck comes.  I am sure that any landlord would sympathize if this is your first time ever being late in two years.  He might even wave the late fee.  As long as you have communication with him, I am sure he won't have a problem with it.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I'm sorry to hear you're between a rock and a hard place.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I'd pay my rent late.  I would apologize profusely to my landlord and make promises about it never happening again.  Have you told him you've had unexpected medical bills?  That can sometimes hit people's soft spot.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	We had to do that before we asked him if we could pay him a week late . our rent is a lot cheaper than yours we pay $620 a month for a 2 bedroom duplex with a full basement.|`|J7GTIE5raa	I would pay what I could so that I would be able to buy some food for myself and child. Sticky situation and the landlord should stick by your side.|`|qVL5R8nuaa	I would ask the landlord if I can pay a portion of it now and the rest on Friday. It would be unwise to go without any money whatsoever for a week.|`|AA11923501	I would pay the rent.|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	I would pay my rent and eat peanut butter sandwiches.|`|AA12357988	That's a tough call.  In most places, you actually have until the 10th before it's considered 'late'.  They have to give you a grace period.  I would pay some now, and some later.  But I have a child in the house, so we wouldn't be able to scrounge for food.  She eats a LOT.|`|AA11356977	Talk to your land lord and ask if you can keep 100 for food and explain whats goin on. Tell him you willl pay the late fee along with the 100, he may be understanding and say ok and keep the late fee. Being  honest and keeping communication open with him is the best. I would never just send less without talking to him. Try getting rid of stuff like treats, cable, house phone, and keep a mobile phone only.|`|da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	I'd pay the rent and eat a little unhealthy for the week. It won't kill you and hopefully, you have friends and family that won't mind feeding you a day or two.  This may not be the last time this happens and I'd hate to have to start worrying about being late AGAIN with the rent, you know? So I'd just pay it now when you do have the option in case it ever does come up where you really may not be able to in the future.  Good luck to you !!!!|`|iiJK4Ivraa	OK ONE PAY THE RENT,NEXT GET A SMALL LOAN FROM FAMILY AROUND $100 WILL DO FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS.

THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS TO DO TO ENTERTAIN YOURSELVES WITH OUT SPENDING MONEY. GO TO THE PARK, CHECK OUT MOVIES FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY, READ MORE, HAVE FRIENDS OVER FOR DRINKS " SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY TEN BUCKS A BEER AT A BAR" ETC. SAVE SAVE SAVE UNTIL YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO FALL BACK ON.|`|rroE37HTaa	I would talk with my landlord and ask IF it would be possible to pay 3/4 of your rent now, and the following 1/4 on payday..explain that you had some expenses come up that you did not plan on. Most landlords appreciate a long term tenant they know! Do this before your rent is due. They may say no because they need the money to pay their bills..but chances are good they will do this favor for you once. I know I wouldn't be too happy if someone just came and told me they could NOT pay rent, yet carried bags of grocery's home!|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Tough spot.  If you have a good payment history then tell the landlord your situation and ask if you can pay $1000 now and the rest at the end of the week.  It should not be a problem.  $100 will buy enough groceries and gas to get to work.  Good luck...|`|e1oky4jSaa	If the landlord will let you pay it a week late I would do that rather than have zero dollars and nothing to eat. Honestly if it were me though I would pick up an extra shift at work and make up the money immediately.|`|xGshAiXOaa	Pay your rent and make it work.  If you can't afford your rent now, how is adding late fees and penalties going to help the situation?  You said it yourself, you won't starve, and a roof over my head is better than a 'buffer' in my account.  If you both have weekends off, try to find something to do for extra cash.  My husband will go work with his father on the weekends if we need money, and I will go down to the local beauty parlor that his grandma hangs out at and wash some of the ladies' cars.  There's always something you can do, clean out the garage/attic and have a yard sale.|`|ODYrypwaaa	I would def pay the rent.  Don't ruin your credit and don't lose your home.  You CAN live on PB & J and pasta.  Also call your family get a loan for a week or two of $100 for gas and extra.|`|AA11329026	give the landlord at least half tell him you'll have the rest by friday. start looking into budgeting your money better so you don't get into that situation again.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	Call your landlord let him know your situation and find out how much you can pay untill you get paid again!! If you've never paid late before im sure he'll sympathize... good luck|`|9yurQ85Eaa	I would ask to pay half now and the rest Friday.|`|5hxWSezPaa	pay the rent|`|zMg4hQwDaa	pay rent|`|MuVKeK8faa	I always paid my rent on time full amount.  Yes, that even meant some nights I went to bed hungry.|`|c6206b40d5e4899522260146aef60470aa	We are in that situation right now.....and we payed our rent.|`|AA10097443	Tricky..I have been in this place more then a thousand times..it seems..your have to call your landlord and negotiate to balance things out..will they allow you to payment plan your way out of this pinch..what would the damage be if you paid late..? (if you have been the 2 years you have a great record to lean on during trouble time..but you have to weight that against the need. (First of all you have to have a buffer to get you through the next week or so until more income comes in. (1) option pay as much rent as you can lets say 70% keep the rest for buffer. in cash..and a little in bank.. Pay the difference over time..The 30% of rent you did not pay. (That's if Landlord agrees..other wise you have to borrow the money..to have that buffer..you HAVE to have Buffer.|`|7twY5OIuaa	Pay the rent, it WILL haunt you in the future, the recession is kicking every one in the head. Try some community food programs. Don't be too proud to accept help, everybody is hurting. You may have to put the daycare on hiatus and I am sure people will understand. If not, they are just going to have to. You need to survive right now and in the future there will be other clients.|`|QilfSBfsaa	I would keep $100 for food and give $1,000 to the landlord for to show my sincerity of paying rent, of course I will pay the balance rent as soon as I get money.|`|rGStRem1aa	dont you have overdraft for your chequing account?<br>  <br>  oh oh!! i'm pretty sure there is a 7-10 day grace period before your rent is actually late.  speak with your landlord on that.  this happened to us a few times back in the day...|`|97b7d9795e7ae2ee4648b9cbb2fe32a4aa	i would give him the rent minus a hundred bucks and let him know he'll get it as soon as the paycheck is cashed on friday.|`|eEu3zbVTaa	Pay your rent.  You could ask your landlord if you could pay 1000, then use the 100 for food and as a buffer.  Good Luck!|`|07AwR3rdaa	I haven't done word problems since college.  sorry.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	I'd give the landlord $900 and tell him I'll have the rest on friday.<br>  <br>  Another point is that you don't want to have your bank account at 0. There's always some darned fee or something that hits and then you get an overdraft fee and there goes another 30 bucks. It's a vicious cycle.
PwkVl3ymaa	ok look that happend to me i think that you should end your relation ship with him because if he is forsing you on something like this then you dont know what he is gana forse you when u 2 get married so i mean you can talk to him about it if doesnt change is mind then tell him that u dont wana do it bc trust me it will be bad 3sum is horable its not good at all <br>  trust me i am not kidding but once again its up to u what u wana do i just recommend you that you talk to him and if he doesnt change his mind than leave him|`|FXBCYFhuaa	Yes. Do it. He loves you and wants to give you one of your most pleasurable experiences of your life. Your boyfriend and his best friend would give you double vaginal sex and double penetration. You would really like that experience and thank  your boyfriend for letting you have the experience of a lifetime.<br>  <br>  I might even want to give a  future gf an experience like that. Women really like it when their partners let them have extra on the side.|`|gkWizapuaa	u should tell your future husband that if he really loves you then he want make you do something that is violating to you and wrong. You should tell him that you do not want to do that. And if he dosnt want to go along with what you are sayin tell him its over. because if he really loves u he wouldnt want u 2 do something that u dnt want to do. Even if u all are in a long relationship it still not worth you respect and your body.|`|vzEUP1fdaa	That's messed up.. It's really up to you though. It's a stupid thing for him to say but I guess it just depends on if you really want to be with him and if how adventurous you are sexually. <br>  <br>  >>Are you sure that if you have sex with them.. that he's not going to back out on the marriage thing? This is so weird, but I mean go for it if you want. I'd prob consider it. ha.|`|4O9FsO3Xaa	wtf?<br>  dude thats so messed up that he would actually say something like that.<br>  u really must be torn right now.<br>  but dont do it if ur not comfortable with it.<br>  he loves you and wants to marry you for who u r and what u two can become together then believe it or not hes not for u.|`|LiZir5Jiaa	yea, he has the wrong intentions if he is going to tell u the ONLY way he will marry u is i u do that...if he REALLY loves u, then he will marry you just because he loves you, not because he wants something from you|`|faeXRQmcaa	Say no! Why would he want to share you with his friend? Even of you love him, you dont have to do it if you dont want!! If he doesnt like the NO the he doesnt respect you.|`|IUqKxMfWaa	thats not love that taking advantage of you. i dont think you should but its your life but honestly thats not right and if he really loved you he would want you all to himself and not share you|`|h8fvKM1jaa	Somebody is not normal here.|`|S8AE1GCuaa	dude sounds like a creep..|`|uBssj3Znaa	you tell him no, and then break up with him. He is using your emotions to get something he wants that he knows you wouldn't do otherwise.|`|3FKMMoXkaa	eew...that is perverted...and i think this is going the wrong way.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	Sounds like a duck.<br>  <br>  How do you feel about ducks?<br>  <br>  How do you feel about yourself?<br>  <br>  If it sounds strange, it really is!<br>  <br>  Marriage is marriage not a sexual triangle.  <br>  <br>  Ask him if he would just rather have the threesome?<br>  <br>  He is attempting to lead you into strange territory.<br>  <br>  Do you really want to go there?<br>  <br>  Make the decision you can honestly survive.  It is really about how he thinks about you.<br>  <br>  Learn from this.|`|FdixIDR1aa	If this is a serious question, you need to get some self respect and dump him. Why on earth would you want to be married to a guy who wants you to have sex with his best friend? He obviously doesn't love you and just sees you as a piece of a**!|`|crw44vnRaa	NO FREAKING WAY!!!!!!!! You start of a marriage like that whats to say he's nor going to start selling you out or something. No guy that loves a girl would even consider that. He does not have your best interests at heart that's for sure. Don't do it, He's crazy!!!!|`|O0pYOOpAaa	Lol wow. Can you type with the CAPs off like normal people.|`|PXuoxlwbaa	if hes going to make you do something like that to marry you then he's not for real. that is effed up. Tell him NO. You want to marry him but not if he's going to pressure you into doing things like that for it. Marriage should be because you love someone and want to marry them, not a privilege when you let him do something like that.|`|lBZkXzr0aa	wow,  that is a new one for me.  A man is going to allow another man to "f" his future wife!  or is his best friend a Girl?   Either way its pretty crazy.  If its something that your not into then I would say no,  you do something because you want to not because you were coerced into it.  <br>  <br>  Its something that you have to think long and hard about.   Doing something like this will not prove your undying love to him,  if he says so.....its a crock of Shyt!  <br>  Good Luck!|`|kxAMOZAuaa	You say no .. It's a test.. if you say yes.. he wont want to marry you because you would sleep with his best friend.  Think about it.  However if you say no, and thats what he really wanted, then he doesnt respect you and you need to leave him.  Either way you will have an answer.  Good Luck .. oh, and say no.|`|7TWAEBleaa	that's not love. not if your bf wants you to have a three some with his friend. why would he want another guy touching you anyways don't marry him if this is what you "have" to do in order to be with him forever|`|5ajVBIN8aa	what the hell is wrong with him??!!!! just dont do that.. do you want him to do this thing that you really love him? no..  i think he would like to be adventourous.. but not this type of adventure.. just dont do it!!!|`|AA11603529	that's effed up. If he's going to force you into that sort of situation there's something wrong with him. And if he really loves you he won't want someone else's hands on you.|`|pVaZty4Maa	that was really f***** up, you should tell him to go f*** off and you should go find someone better than that bastard|`|Cl2nEDtZaa	I think something is messed up here? /:)

YOU ARE NOT VERY OLD I SUSPECT? IT SOUNDS TO ME THAT HE DOES LIKE YOU AND WANTS TO BE WITH YOU! AND BY BEING WITH THIS OTHER GIRL... I THINK WHAT HE IS REALLY SAYING IS THAT "I DON'T WANT HER, I WANT YOU! AND OBVIOUSLY, I THINK HE IS TRYING TO MAKE YOU JEALOUS SWEETIE! AS FAR AS THE SAD LOOKS, HE IS TRYING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. READ BETWEEN THE LINES! <br>   I WISH I KNEW YOUR AGE. YOU SAY HE THOUGHT YOU DID NOT LIKE HIM... ANY THING YOU DID OR SAID GIVE HIM THAT IMPRESSION? GUYS ARE LIKE BABIES YOU REALLY NEED TO CODDLE THEM. GIRL... IF YOU LIKE THIS BOY AND HE LIKES YOU,,, LET HIM KNOW HOW YOU FEEL! YOU CAN HAVE HIM IF YOU WANT HIM! HE DOES LIKE YOU AND I THINK HE DOES WANT YOU, THAT IS WHY HE WONT LEAVE YOU ALONE! THIS OTHER GIRL, SHE IS MERELY A REPLACEMENT FOR YOU. HE WANTS YOU TO SEE THAT HE IS CATCH ABLE. HE FEELS LIKE YOU DON'T WANT HIM AND SOME ELSE DOES. IF YOU WANT HIM GO GET YOUR MAN! I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL HAVE HIM.|`|w9svzs2Saa	Well well well..<br>  It's about 2 options you have.<br>  <br>  1] Hun, he obviously still likes you if he's not leaving you alone. If he's still giving you sad looks then he's sad because he wanted you. Have you tried telling him how you feel? I know it's hard seeing as that you're quiet, but if you like him & he likes you back..then it's worth it. Try talking to him in private, get some guts to tell him what you truly feel. And if he says that he "thought", stop him and tell him "well you thought wrong" and see where that gets you. But don't be so up tight about it. Make yourself sound understanding and caring. =]<br>  <br>  2] If you feel that he really doesn't like you anymore because he has some other girl. Then maybe he just gave up on you because you nor him have mad a move. And since he "thought" that you didn't like him, that just ruined all chances. So i say, to get over him, start looking around for someone new. [[Im trying to do that too, and i know it's not easy..But i'm trying my best.]] If that doesn't work out with you then just start going out with friends more often. Occupy yourself by pampering yourself. Watching movies, have fun. x]<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, hun. =]<br>  Ask me more questions if you need any more help.<br>  mctonic@ymail.com <br>  <br>  :]|`|061beed10d29f9c5aa986e3e09fd392daa	you made me confused as well.. just kidding.. well i guess its up to you if you will entertain the gesture or just as u said, forget about him.. anyway in the first place nothing going on between the two of you.. you could try to build friendship but make sure you wont hurt another soul.. if you do, ul end up the bad guy even its not really meant to be... you know what im saying... :) im sure is one person meant for you... :D have faith!|`|Rj7146R9aa	he likes you but he doesnt want to break the other girls heart if you like him then maybe eveantully hell break up with the girl hes dating and you can ask...... if he really doesnt like her then hell eventully break up..... maybe find a different guy and get him jealous|`|hv4KJsy3aa	have an affair with him, because let's face it, he doesn't love the other girl, so you'd be doing her (and yourself) a favor.|`|WsiT3rsFaa	He wants you ALSO!! Stay away from him his a playa, he knew you wanted him at one point thinks he can still have ya|`|SsLY7ehhaa	I personally would say that you need to talk to him one on one and explain how you feel. If it turns out that he really isn't happy with this other girl and wants to be with you instead then maybe when you explain that you like him too, he will leave the other girl and you and him will be together and hopefully happy at last. However if it turns out that he is happy with this other girl and is just trying to be friends with you then you need to tell him that it is too difficult for you because of your feelings for him. Tell him that he needs to leave you alone if this is the case and then you can move on and find someone else. It is the only way, you need to talk to him.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I really hope you get your man and the two of you can be happy, after all you both sound like nice people and deserve to be happy. Hope everything goes okay but if you need any more help, just e-mail me.

th7D0qzqaa	O...M...G! I have the same problem as you. I have this friend. She is AH-MAZING, we've been friends since the second grade, but lately she hadn't been treating me like one. I was late for class because I was helping with her lock, I sat with her during lunch detention ( and had to miss my own lunch), and she treats other people better than me and treats me like I'm the easy-going pushover. Also, when I get good grades she gets super upset, and I think she wishes I didn't. She once even admited she got annoyed when I had fun! She always yells at me, when she's in a grumpy mood, and I sometimes feel like slapping her! But you know what? Don't end the friendship that you have with her, but make sure that from now on, you be stern with her. I mean don't constantly give her firm looks, but when she starts to treat you wrongly, speak up for yourself. If she wants to cancel plans with you, tell her politely that you thought you had plans with her, and that you had everything set and even made your famous sugar cookies just for her, when she was going to come over. Then say it will be a great inconvenience if she were to cancel plans. That way she will be uncomfortable, seeing that it will be HER fault if she was going to cancel plans. And when she wants you to be with her, tell her that you have to go because you have to study for a test. If she says, "Come on, you are my best friend!", firmly say back, " Well if you were my best friend, you would let me study for the test!" And, you know how your friend always say that she's prettier than you, say firmly back, "You have pretty looks, but I am artistic, smart, and funny. Those are qualities that make me so special." Don't forget to say the special part because then she will know that you think that you are one of kind, and you don't think that she's any prettier than yourself. All in all, I think you should be more stern to your best friend, stand up for yourself, and make sure she doesn't think you are wimpy or that she can easily take advantage of you. Good luck!|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	You are singing my song girl! I used to really fret about either putting up with my best friend or letting her go. Then I realized it doesn't have to be an absolute one way or the other. Just put a little distance between the two of you and it won't be so hard a transition to move into. <br>  <br>  you have to decide whether the good times are worth the bad times and whether you want to get her out of your life completely or maybe just mellow out a little. I distanced myself from my b/f some and it did us alot of good.

I think  we should send all women who knowingly mess around with married men to an island far away from civilized society.|`|JUvOKsevaa	If the married man is dating someone (and it is not his wife), then the man is more at fault than whoever he is dating.  I see a lot of people blame the person that their partner is cheating on them with, but place less blame on their partner.  Your partner/husband is the one who vowed to love you and forsake all others; that girl did not promise you that.  While, it is wrong that she is knowingly involved with a married man, the main force of the wife's anger should be at the husband.<br>  <br>  Why would a wife want a husband who cheats on her, regardless if he comes back to her at the end?  The wives that do that need more self-respect.  A husband who cheats cannot love you the way he should if he is willing to cheat on you.  And if they get away with cheating once, they will probably do it again.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	By getting involved with married men, they have already demonstrated a fundamental lack of judgment.  It seems unreasonable of you to expect them somehow to begin miraculously acting reasonable and mature when the wife intervenes in some way.

Who would want a man who cheats on his wife and leaves his wife for another?  Not me and this is why.  He will eventually return the favor to me as well.  I want someone who is going to love me and just me.|`|x3LclBZ0aa	i totally agree with you about the "other women" having no right to be mad at the wife. but also keep in mind, that sometimes married men do leave their wives for the other woman. theres always exception the rule. <br>  however, 2 wrongs do not make a right.|`|AA10500537	if they are little girls the guys should be arrested ,<br>   the wife should kick him out|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	AMEN! I totally agree, they need to find there own man, preferably one that is not married!|`|XlhBBZPxaa	this is so true but why put up with a person who uses you like this|`|SuOfRTXzaa	ANYONE that gets involved with a married man deserves all the pain that comes their way,  why should it only be the wife that suffers.<br>  come on ladies CHECK, RECHECK and TRIPLE CHECK that the guy isnt married before you get involved.|`|chlvKoXqaa	where do they come from? broken or dysfunctional homes. or they are simply attention whores.|`|34550d5f2dff52eadb5794f5944a6de1aa	YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT IN CAPITALS.  THEY ARE JUST A FLING AND DONT MEAN ANYTHING TO MARRIED GUYS.  THEY DO GO BACK TO THEIR WIVES.  (POOR WIVES).|`|pxygDg7Aaa	I don't know where they get off . . . . .but do you know where i can find them?|`|DlCcFu1eaa	It's part of a wider phenomenon where people have this obsession with always seeing themselves as right no matter how wrong they are. No matter how absurd their actions they find some way to make it the other persons fault, or at the very least not their own. <br>  <br>  I developed a practice of saying if even to myself "I was wrong" and "I made a mistake" whenever I see that I've screwed up. It frees me up to improve myself and it's liberating. If you listen, you'll find that very few people ever admit that they were wrong about anything without qualifying in some way that it's still not their fault. No wonder the world is so F'd up.|`|ixHwF4apaa	they might be vexed, commit sucide,pick another guy or live alone, any one thing happened|`|1HfLkTrdaa	Not to defend those women, but they are not innocent "little girls" <br>  <br>  They are GROWN WOMEN who know the difference between right and wrong, and who are ultimately responsible for their actions...except they just don't care who they hurt when they choose to do an wilful, intentional, immature and selfish action like go after another woman's husband. <br>  <br>  They got no excuses for what they're doing...and even if the man didn't say right off the bat that he's married, way I see it that once they DO find out, they should do the right thing  and break up with that guy right then and there and stay away...but nooooo. They still keep hanging on, don't they?<br>  <br>  Well, if they're "woman enough" to be a homewrecking tramp,  then they should be "woman enough" to admit they are in the wrong for doing so...and "woman enough" to accept the consequences....like the wife administering a righteous butt whipping on the hussy...AND the husband for bring that SHEEEEET into her house!!! <br>  <br>  j/k  more like the loss of reputation and respect from society.|`|dvQYaRNDaa	Some married men are real scum and while he's telling the wife one thing he's telling the other woman another. <br>  <br>  I was once with a married man, but I didn't know he was married until AFTER the sex. He never wore a ring or talked about his kids or about his wife. I worked with him for six months and it was only after he told everyone at our job what we did that anyone bothered letting me know about his wife at home.<br>  <br>  I continued to see him (stupid of me) and I never wanted to tell his wife or become anything significant to him. However my friend who knew what was going on always threatened to go to his house and tell his wife. Needless to say I ended that friendship over this mess.<br>  <br>  You have to understand there's two sides to affairs. Plus if he gets bored with one side piece who's to say he wont pick up another....marriage doesn't guarantee fidelity.|`|m81dfyOYaa	I think what is just as bad is the gf who is dating the married, separated man and complaining about the children taking up too much time.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	his lips move but she can't hear what he's saying.

You hit me first (woman or no woman) you get hit back.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	First of all, I would say that you want to stay out of it.  No matter what you say it's going to be the wrong thing.  Second, yeah he was justified in stopping her from hurting him.  If I elbowed my husband in the nose he would probably automatically react violently.  That hurts a lot!  As to whether the relationship can work, well that depends on them and if they are always like this.  If it was just a fight that got out of control, then maybe.|`|xxSGhywoaa	Completely justified.  This is no longer a battle of the sexes.  This is a battle of self defense.  Without knowing the circumstances of the elbowing, I'd tell the MAN to leave.  She's not a good person.|`|AA11501437	yep - he has a right to restrain and or defend himself for sure!!<br>  <br>  if you're going to hit someone - be prepared for retaliation - no matter who you are!<br>  <br>  if i were a guy and a girl elbowed me in the face, i'd have a hell of a time keeping myself from kicking some a s s|`|i3PGjRRfaa	He would be fully justified in kicking her @ss - which is what he should have done..............<br>  <br>  Until she learns her role (whatever it is in the relationship) things won't work out.|`|FtyLwqR5aa	First thin she should never have done what she done to him. Now that the violence has started on either side they need to split. one will end up hurting the other.|`|KKCMIE04aa	You all need to calm down and think about whats going on.|`|VR9iC2ykaa	well in order to be equal if she hit him first then i can see why he would do that...|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	She shouldn't be hitting him very simple.  She shouldn't be laying a hand on him at all.  His first reaction is hitting back however two wrongs do not make a right.  He should call the police on her instead but you cannot blame the guy for reacting the way that he did that is just a reaction (wrong reaction) but a reaction..|`|XlhBBZPxaa	I have always lived with the rule that it takes a piece of junk to hit a man and a bigger piece of trash to hit a woman|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Yes, it's fine.  If they're both under 6 years old.  Otherwise, they BOTH need to learn to control themselves a little, and to avoid dysfunctional relationships from now on.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	If he was ONLY trying to restrain her so to prevent her from hitting him some more, then it's justified.  Even cops will restrain a female who may attack or harm herself.|`|AUsvrW8faa	They should part ways immediately.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Hey, if she hit him first, he has the right to defend himself.|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	tell them to play nice and keep there hands to themselves.|`|HgW2Zwxqaa	Force with force is not right|`|L2t7Ek4paa	There is no excuse... he should have just walked away.|`|ltXxNfwRaa	I think its crap that when a female does something violent and the guy reacts that its "wrong".  Personally, if I hit a guy and he hit me back then it was my own fault for hitting him in the first place.  If people want equality then there shouldn't be stipulations!<br>  <br>  Any way you look at it tho, the violence not right... its good that he restrained her but they should probably both speak to a mediator about their problems.  There might be some underlying anger issues that need to be dealt with.  I know I used to have them myself and my bf had to restrain me a couple times... its not healthy but it happens and sometimes you just need the right friends/professionals to talk to, to find out whats going on inside and to let whatever it is thats making you angry, go.|`|fOQ2TDIeaa	You know it is never right for a man to hurt a woman, even if she hurts him first. But, it is his natural instinct to react the way he did, especially after being hit in the nose. That really hurts. Does she have a history of hitting him or others? Were they sober? There may be more here then what you see. Maybe she needs some anger management classes because, violence is never the answer. I don't think they should stay together their violent behavior towards each other will only get worse. Unless they get some counseling.|`|JuqxbJ3Daa	First of all I hope she did that accidentally. And if not two wrongs do not make a right. He shouldn't be putting his hands on her and she shouldn't be doing that to him either. A relationship can work after that if they act like adults. They need to learn if one makes the other one mad no matter had bad you might what to throw a punch it's just better to walk away until you cool off. Because if you don't you end of doing something stupid and have regrets.|`|fLU63N4kaa	Hunny if she wanted the opinion of a load of faceless computer users she would have come here! But she asked you, she wants your opinion. Tell her what you think of it!<br>  <br>  Imagine the situation happening but without any faces on the people, and evaluate it in your mind. Then tell her your opinion of it.|`|56O0inIeaa	it should only be right for a person to attack another in terms of self-defense. If your friend elbowed her man because of self-defense, its okay. If she elbowed him otherwise, she's the one at fault and the man had the right to restrain her for her violence.|`|Ggn7YkVIaa	if he was trying to restrain her then I don't think it's wrong, he shouldn't deliberately hit her back, but he absolutely has a right to defend himself and shouldn't just stand there and get pummeled on.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Nobody should be attacking anyone regardless of their gender, it's not good for a relationship, violence is pointless.|`|I71ePk4Haa	Obviously, both of them are out of control. They need some time away from each other, and some type of counseling.|`|BYg26Mggaa	no i dont think a man should ever atack a girl but sh shouldnt hav atacked him either<br>  and it matters if they can get through that and continue being together|`|22ee87c4e7e3af321345eba90245a377aa	A real man will never do anything like that to a woman.  If the woman hits first a real man will just walk away.|`|XUPsK2Nsaa	HELLLLLLLLLLLL NOOOOOOOOO its not ok, she should elbow him in the balls next time her man puts his hands on her.

I don't think its right for either of them to hit each other. If they can't play nice, they probably shouldn't play at all (i.e. shouldn't date)|`|AYiBPcUaaa	i think that is a tricky situation but i think he had a right to restrain her. but then again he should not have put his hands on her. so either way i think you should tell your friend that they should just forget about because they both did something they should not have done|`|9136WNCzaa	You are white trash.

Start talking to people, guys, girls, just be outgoing.  Shyness is just a part of insecurity in my opinion.  Just be confident in yourself.|`|qDl5Gegbaa	1) First of all, why are you shy? Figure that out and try and conquer it.<br>  2) Act as if you're not shy. In private, behave as if you're oozing confidence. Hold your chin up, stick your chest out, add a swagger to your walk and speak firmly. It may seem ridiculous, but you will see results when you're out in public. <br>  3) Look your best. One way to improve self-consciousness is to always look good and limit ways you can be self-critical.<br>  4) Lower your fear of rejection by imagining the worst possible outcome. If you approach someone, they may say "no" or they may just walk away. Absolutely everybody has been rejected at some point, but no one has to dwell on it. (<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2879_overcome-shyness.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2879_overcome-sh...</a><br>  <br>  The best way to overcome shyness is to practice speaking and talking with people you are not intimidated by. Try striking up random conversations with others - it will become more natural.<br>  If you know you are going to bump into her (inbetween classes on campus or something) think of a few things ahead of time you can talk about. <br>  The biggest thing is to have a "who cares" attitude about it. Pretend like she's just a friend and be yourself. We can tell when guys are nervous and putting on a show. It's much more sincere when your just yourself, even if you are nervous - we like that too believe it or not!<br>  <br>  *Make sure you listen to what she says and reply to it. <br>  *Compliments never hurt either but just be aloof about it. For example, just tell her she looks nice, and leave it at that. <br>  *When you talk to her, try and remember something she talked about so you can ask her about it the next time you see her. Like if she's nervous about a presentation ask her how it went the next time. *Suggest to get together for a drink or coffee sometime. <br>  *I love when guys ask my opinon or advice on something. It shows they value my input and is flattering all in itself.<br>  <br>  If I think of more I'll add it and good luck, we are really not that scary :)<br>  <br>  ehow.com has some good suggestions also....<br>  ** Observe the communication skills of someone you admire. Note the way others respond to this person. Take one or two of the key phrases or ideas this person uses, and make them your own. <br>  ** Confront your fears in a role-playing situation. Sit down with a trusted family member or friend, and practice sharing your feelings with them before you meet with the actual recipient.
RuJhWnS5aa	You don't want to hurt anybody and you don't want to start drama?  Your answer is pretty obvious then.  Don't go after this guy. :/  And if you do want to pursue him, wait a few months before you do.  That way, you'd still be respecting your ex's feelings by not dating someone right away.|`|utGddhnVaa	If you think that you still might hurt the other guy and piss off your ex...just find a new field to play in. none of you need that headache|`|SNCeFeY1aa	wait for a bit, find out how this guy feels about you. wait long enough that your ex wont be so hurt by this, if you do end up going out with his friend|`|98LDN0Quaa	if you dont wanna start drama then just befriends with this guy for a little while..and anyway you were with him first right?...so your ex should chill...see how the guy feels about you...maybe wait and see till your ex is dating other ppl as well then make your move.|`|sAYu1JNDaa	Follow your heart. Not the reality show that your mind is telling you that you are a part of. Wait a while though, make sure that what you are feeling for this other guy is real. You don't want him to just b a rebound.|`|7myZDJDNaa	just go for it<br>  dont worry about anything else|`|vhckzH4Qaa	i say go for it because i was in a similar situation but you have to think that if you dont act on this guy that you have kinda always had feelings for then you will never know if you could have had something really good. You could be GREAT together but if your scared of others , yes it may hurt some people at first but if you dont act it could hurt you. Why not go for it, your ex is your ex and I say GO FOR IT.|`|ldejLcqiaa	i think i heard a study one time, and it said your gut instinct, like your first thought to go trough with something, is usally the best way to handle it.<br>  whatever you thought was the best choice first is probably right.|`|PA11NoYDaa	Take your time and figure out what is best for you.
etV271ARaa	Firstly, get noticed. Let him be interested. Dress well, be sophisticated and mature. That makes him feel a little (just a little) inadequate. Then approach him one day when he is alone. By then he will so fortunate to speak and to be seen with you. When people want to get to know you, they tend to easily answer questions about themselves. <br>  <br>  Talk, get to know him better. Only then decide is its worth taking another step|`|dKyi5MLKaa	be canny act cool and casual<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227095716AAjeKLv">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|4JfALOMkaa	Be friendly and be yourself. Ask him about what he's interested in and what he's been up to since the last time you spoke to him. You'll find out from the way he acts whether he's a nice person or not. People are really judgemental when it comes to things like this. I'm sure he's had a lot on his plate since his brother died, it's a big thing to have to handle and it really cant be easy. Just be supportive and make him laugh have fun together and it'll be great.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)

ltUzwXZEaa	The truth of the matter is that they are both at fault even though neither of them want to admit it. Either of them had a right to do what they did,and if they do not start trusting each other and telling each other what is really going their marriage is doomed for disaster,no matter who did what they just need to move on forgive then share all even if they know the other may like what ever the other has to say.|`|ea411a2c44df3b7648b1c84f352a4902aa	So you're saying her being a snoop somehow justifies the husband's infidelity?  <br>  <br>  Or does the hubby know she also cheated and had a revenge affair? <br>  <br>  And as far as playing the blame game.

There's communication, counselling, divorce in that case, not cheating.<br>  <br>  Snooping doesn't give somebody a licence to cheat. That's breaking the marriage vows and very wrong. You promise to forsake all others. You don't promise not to snoop.<br>  <br>  Yes, in terms of the overall decline of the relationship, that takes two.

You decided not to go to your friends house, sometimes you will have to be around people you dont like, but we have to put up with them and be civil anyways.|`|UIhqGzidaa	Sounds like you need some new "friends." By the way, if you were her friend at all, you wouldn't have called her such an awful name. Do you know what the word means?|`|CRk1goz4aa	You should stop worrying about what other people think about you and then you won't be so mad.|`|Pd1Dout5aa	why is she your friend then !?!?!?!?!? ditch that ***** duh!|`|U4Rf1rjuaa	Oh, I think you should focus more on your school work than worrying about your friends.

However, I think you might want to allow some time to pass so emotions can settle down a bit.  Then you might want to ask Tiffany not to say or do things like that in front of other people.<br>  <br>  You're probably pretty upset and angry with Tiffany and may even want to lash out at her or think you want to "get even" with her.  Usually anger is a "surface" emotion and when you examine what's really causing the anger you find out that it's emotional pain of some kind.  For example, I think it hurt your feelings when Tiffany laughed when Laura said you were a bum-sucker and then it hurt you again today when she said you weren't allowed to go out after school.|`|N0Pplfsjaa	I just wanna know why you still call her your friend?<br>  <br>  People (more so younger people) would rather be around a million people and miserable than to dare say that they sit alone.<br>  <br>  If you can list 3 people as TRUE friends then you've done very well.<br>  <br>  In Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail the play, Madea is talking to her nephew giving him advice.

jYBl7AVQaa	That is not normal behavior, but I wouldn't be totally weirded out. She's probably just really determined to help you succeed in life. Sometimes teachers take an affinity to students.

Not sure why she would ask you too sleep over.  Maybe she's just concerned about you or maybe she's developing some kind of feelings for you.  Try talking to her and see if you can find out what's going on.|`|NSzmBW7caa	It is just a little strange.<br>  If what she is doing is making you uncomfortable, then tell her.<br>  Tell someone else if it gets bad.<br>  But just watch what she does, and you will know if you need to get away.|`|UupJwvYZaa	yeah that's a little weird. if it's making you uncomfortable, there's probably something not right. trust your instincts and avoid her if that's what they are telling you.|`|qUFcR0w9aa	Yeah, that sounds kind-of weird. Are you sure you aren't looking into this way to much? Or not enough? I mean if she is really helping you out with your exams and studying, I wouldn't want to pass her up, but at the same time you shouldn't feel uncomfortable around her either. She is supposed to be there to help you. I say as long as she doesn't make it akward for you, just keep having her help you out, but if you feel like shes hitting on you.. and going to far, then don't talk to her anymore!|`|7be60c6f64a7e3394c128788505e550faa	Dear, your relationship has absolutely no boundaries. She seems very lonely, and that's probably why she is all over this friendship. Clearly you are uncomfortable, or you would not have written on this site. You really need to draw some lines in your relationship, so that you feel you have some control back in your "own" life.|`|4XvC1pYfaa	its strange...  does she have other friends ? i guess she feels like ur her best friend and that ur so close to each other .. or she just likes to support u and take care of u.. it isnt a bad thing thou..unless u dont wanna be with her anymore.. but i really think she loves helping u
H5xmpunRaa	You did nothing wrong! Not at all... in fact you are being a good friend by telling her exactly what you think. Im 17, and all the guys I know wouldnt even go for someone that young, it is wrong. But also you have to think on the side, you cant help who you fall in love with... My 16 year old friend just had a baby with a 46 year old!! That is wrong if anything is!! <br>  Its okay, things will probably dye out,<br>  if not, the best thing you can do is just tell her parents..<br>  but dont let her know that they heard it from you.<br>  At least then they are aware.<br>  <br>  =]|`|AA10306025	You did nothing wrong.  However, you know your friend better than I do, some kids at 13 look older and the guy may not know how old she is.  You did the right thing and if your friend is mad, then so be it.  It is reckless to behave this way, and it is your job as a friend to point it out to her.  She will get over it.
WiaMtrnyaa	No you don't have to answer the phone but what if she was calling to say sorry or something just tell her you don't want to fight and u still want to be friends and if you want to get out of this fight and she thinks you should say sorry just say sorry and get it over with!!!hope i helped
yA8sw0bOaa	o.k first you need to sit and try to talk to them one at a time but try to talk to the one you were in a relatioship with first. tell him everything that had happen with you and his brother tell him the whole truth and see how he feels if he called you a hoe (which i think you not i'm 17 and i never had sex before)then ya'll don't need to be friends with benifits don't feel guilty whats done is done but you need to stand up foir your self and tell him that your not a hoe and what happen happen the second brother if he's serious about the relationship i advice you to start as friends because that;s how all relationships are suppose to go and be then you move on to the next level and see how he acts then but you  need to ask him if he knew you were going with his brother and then when ya'll had sex 3 times why he felt guilty so he knew what he was doing and i feel maybe he really didn't care about you but maybe it wasn't eant for ya;ll to be togeather in the first place it was meant for you and the second brother to be togeather but give him a shot don't have sex again until you feel that you and him have feelings for each other and i mean where you can tell him anything and how friends would do so hold on to that even though you already had sex still it's a precious treasure and only give it to the prince you really love i know it feel good but just hold out maybe you can just get some head unti then but if you feel you can't wait then tell him how you feel and then if he feel the same way thats you cue so gooed luck and tell me what happen|`|02tWMJk3aa	heh..?<br>  <br>  I couldn't even read half of that because of the horrible sentence structure, and run on sentences, I mean we all know its the age of the internet, but come on, put a period or an enter or something in there to break things up a bit..<br>  <br>  And sorry no compassion here, because you cheated on someone, and now you 'feel bad'.... BOO HOO.....|`|jXnpJM0Oaa	Cool.  Maybe you can have a baby by each brother, then go on Jerry Springer and do a "who's my baby daddy?" show.|`|98LDN0Quaa	It's a lost cause...just end it between both and move on...cause then when ever you guys get into a fight this will always come up..no matter whats said to make it better.|`|cA8WjmIAaa	damnnnnnn...you just got caught up but to be real<br>  girl you need to move!!|`|e59bc254d8339c1ae45e999a109e63e4aa	What you did was totally wrong. You did not use good jugdment. My advice is just apologize to both. Leave them both alone, and move on. Take this as a learning experience. God bless.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Follow your instinct about this, and not your heart or mind.|`|urGXKo7Raa	You dumb *** why did you do that now they will like hate YOU because of that now all you have to do is to get away from them and start a DAMN NEW LIFE!!!!!!|`|AA11603529	Wow. Longness. Umm you should be with whoever you want to be with, though what happened was kind of bad.|`|67ThRN4Taa	Could you break that down into paragraphs?|`|lfp3K3Czaa	wow people out there are very stupid and i think u wear i mean really using people to make yourself bater so sad.|`|eBEfZO9eaa	I think since there was dishonesty between the brothers, and you weren't really into the first brother the answer is clear--do not see either them.  You probably already know that this is the best thing.  It'sjust not a good situation all the way around.  Meet someone else and you will probably be a lot happier instead of worrying about this.|`|GuNBgiEWaa	i know someone who did the same thing as you but with 3 or 4 of the 6 brothers.  their mom couldn't stand her and can you blame her?  she ended up pregnant and nobody knows who the daddy is.  is this something you would want to explain to your child when they grow up?<br>  <br>  your best bet is to move on and forget that it ever happened.  they'll never really respect you.  and regardless of whatever mistakes you have made this far, you deserve love and respect. i think you understand that you won't find that by sleeping with guys the first time you kick it with them.  and you see that these two brothers are only trying to outdo the other.  they don't really want a serious relationship with you no matter what they say. i don't think you really want to be sleeping with a bunch of different guys so you really have to understand that no matter how loved they make you feel, you just don't need to give it up that quickly.  if they aren't just trying to get into your pants and truly do love you, they'll be around even if you don't put out right away.      hey, we all make mistakes but it is never too late to demand respect--from yourself and others.<br>  <br>  and whether you continue the way you have been or decide that you are better than that---PLEASE START USING PROTECTION ALL THE TIME<br>  good luck|`|CRk1goz4aa	Pretty much the one you are cheating is yourself. You are sleeping with these men before you get a chance to know them and before you give them a chance to prove themselves to you. You need to practice more self-restraint....and I hope you are using protection...for your own protection.<br>  <br>  Don't be surprised if you are being compared by the two...they got their share and now they're keeping count. You became a "thing".|`|vzEUP1fdaa	Who do you want a relationship with..? Either way, I think there could be a future, but it's prob best that you just let this one go and move on.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	why are  you confused? if you can be with both then be with both if thats what you want<br>  enjoy your life!<br>  this is a chance of a lifetime opportunity<br>  dont lose it!|`|AA11558572	When he called and said you were stupid, he was right.|`|dtyeY6HDaa	Find new friend they are creep|`|2a44232a3c44c2b41040c70dc6970400aa	Whoa!  First off, emails and texting are really poor ways to discuss important subjects because they're crappy at conveying tone and context.  Worse yet, they can get passed around or read by the wrong person.  Never write what should be said instead.<br>  <br>  Second, everyone involved is trying to justify their own poor choices by blaming someone else.  None of you are owning up for your own behavior.  Instead you're just compounding the brain damage.<br>  <br>  Third, since a lot of this is revolving around casual sex in a family triangle, it has a great potential to spiral into something much much worse.<br>  <br>  Regardless of how badly you have been treated by these guys, you owe each of them an apology for your own behavior.  They owe you one too, but that's their issue to grow up on their own.  Then you'd be wise to steer clear of both of them.

WYYTMgnfaa	Yes & I still love him and I know I will forever. I would give him anything, my hopes, my dreams, my soul, my life, they are nothing without him. I have never seen beauty so beautiful before. He is my angel, he made me into this hopeless romantic that I am, reminding me that true love does exist. We belong together, we could create such perfection together but we don't live in a world of perfection so who knows if we will be together. I know we are soulmates but im too afraid to tell and he knows we are soulmates but doesnt realise it yet.|`|EPaYoJaiaa	yes with my ex-boyfriend. We dated for 4 years and about 6 months after we broke up I found out that he had never really loved me, he only stayed with me because he knew how much I loved him. He knew my love for him was true. It'll be 2 years in may since we broke up and I still love him with all my heart and soul. I've tried to hate him, I really have. Everytime I would think about him I'd try to think of all the bad things but it never was enough. Even using me for my heart isn't enough to make me hate him. I have not moved on. Every guy I meet seems to either be psychologically crazy or already in a relationship. Plus there's also to consider the fact that I have my ex always in the back of my mind. I personally do not think that's fair to the next guy I date. I want to have an emotional disconnection from my past first before I get back in there. I doesn't seem like that'll ever happen though. No I do not believe we will ever be together again, sometimes yeah in the night i imagine that some miraculous thing will happen and he'll come back to me claiming it was all a big mistake. But I know in my heart it's just imagination, not reality. He'll never come back to me, I never really had him in the first place.|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	No, I have never known a love like that.<br>  <br>  I think if  I loved someone who did not love me, I'd let him/her go.|`|CpevWaQ7aa	I had that happen before, but if there not going to feel the same about you your better of trying to find someone who will love you back the way you love them|`|5XYlHv6Paa	Yes, when I was young and stupid. You have to move on, and it won't be easy, but you have to.|`|7TWAEBleaa	if i gave my all to someone who didn't give me anything back i wouldn't even waste my time waiting ..just move on and look for someone who'll give you the love back that you deserve|`|hlWiLwaoaa	yah i have...for sure.the guy didnt feel the same way at all and left me for someone else....u should turf him nobody needs that|`|SQe4ghfdaa	Yes, I loved someone when I was 16. I loved him so much that I gave him my heart and my soul and my body, too. I did everything for him. It took me 4 years to see that this guy was not worth it.<br>  <br>  He was cheating on me, he gave me an STD, he was out all the time, he called me about 3 times a week, he wouldn't get a job, my family despised him, and he didn't care about me half as much as I cared about him.<br>  <br>  It took me 4 years but I moved on. I got a much better boyfriend. I thought I was going to be with my first love forever, but apparently there have been other plans in store for me.<br>  <br>  I love my life.|`|YcWGDKvkaa	Yes, honest to goodness I love him so much that I wouldn't care if he would never look at me the way I look at him. I don't care if he married someone else and even though I'd be hurt and be broken...his happiness makes the pain lessen because my heart would know that at least he was happy and that someone was able to make him smile even though I can't.<br>  <br>  I love him enough to let go because I know he deserves someone better than me. Someone who can make him smile and be the best person that he could be. Someone who can inspire him and set his soul on fire and be driven by passionate inspiration.<br>  <br>  Sadly, I don't think I could ever feel like this on anyone else anymore because I've realized that the greater the love, the greater the tragedy.|`|PA11NoYDaa	You will never get over him. As long as you are still communicating with him and doing all this stuff for him you wont get over him and he will continue hurting you. You have to cut off all communication no matter how bad it hurts. Sometimes you will be suprised how fast you can get over someone you thought you would love forever. Besides wouldnt it feel good to not be hurting like that all the time?|`|n0sHQr7caa	I had that happen before and if they dont show that they care or love you then you should just move on. you are wroth better|`|2eHkInEnaa	yea.. it hurts... and is a huge bummer!

Ways to build that trust back is start being more open to your locations. It may sound as if you or he is checking up on each other but that is not the case.

QWaspeg7aa	People who are false and who lie about stuff just to make themselves more interesting. The thing is that its really easy to tell if someone's lying about things like that because lies don't stick in the memory the same way actual events do so they always trip themselves up, but because they've lied they have to maintain it and I just want to scream at them WE KNOW YOU'RE LYING!! but I can't, because I end up feeling sorry for them, that they don't believe their real lives are enough to sustain people's interest in them, which means they can't think much of themselves and probably have self-esteem issues and I haven't got the heart to show them up by exposing them as liars so I just sort of go along with them, which kind of makes me a liar myself, and then I dislike them even more for that, while at the same time feeling sorry for them, when I know I shouldn't, because its all of their own making and I end up not knowing where I am with them, and agreeing with other people who say they know they lie but I always try and make those people give the lying person the benefit of the doubt and try and excuse why they do it, but I've ended up in some sort of anti-whoever-it-is faction when really I just want to be able to say to them that they should stop lying because we all know they do it, but I can't so I end up doubting myself.

HsrRNnIBaa	I like girls best who have a regular or chubby body. I don't like girls who look anorexic, but if they are slim and healthy I don't mind. I think simple haircuts look best. Side bangs are okay, but straight bangs look awful to me. Shoulder length and longer look best to me. I like mid-back length hair best. Pierced ears are fine, but I don't like piercings anywhere else. I don't like tattoos either. These features are what I prefer, but personality is more important. Girls who smoke turn me off more than anything. They're fine for a friend, but I'm not attracted at all to a girl who smokes. And drugs are even worse.|`|ZTcVcmtPaa	I do have a bit of a problem with skinny girls because it usually ends up meaning they are shallow and care solely about looks.

I don't like girls that are obsessive over their looks...eg they put LOADS of makeup on you don't even know their natural skin color.  Piercings, to me are fine as long as they are confined to the ears or perhaps the belly button...but otherwise it can be distracting/annoying...tattoos are cool as long as they are not massive ones...<br>  <br>  my 2 cents|`|6hZFR3phaa	to many piercings is a no no... girls too skinny can be kind of a turn off... there are those girls you can tell that just try too hard to get attention that really bugs me... to tell you the truth when I met my girlfriend I just knew I really wanted to be with her she was the most beautiful girl I have ever seen so it really depends on the guy|`|pePysiAUaa	me personally i like girls skinny quiet and sensitive

Trust me i've been in a long-distance relationship. First i was in the UK and he was in Vancouver Canada. Than i studied in PA (penn state) while he was in vancouver, than i was in PA while he was in UK. This happened over a year (the 2nd year of our relationship). Let me tell you, it was horrible!! I can't imagine being able to get through it without allready knowing him and going put with him allready for a year. And don't get me wrong, we've bot moved and living in the UK now, but if i wasn't sure whether we would be together, i would not be able to handle it having been there myself.

You might not believe this now, but trust me there are soooo many nice guys out there.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Well, what kind of advice do you want?  I say break up with him; it's only been a month and the chances of your love being real this early on is extremely rare.  Long distance relationships don't last often because the desire to have physical contact (not sexual, just physical - to be together) is so strong.  But you don't want to break up with him, so there's no advice to offer you.|`|TiZEswxYaa	you're just setting yourself up to be hurt... have you ever seen him? a little under a month is not enough time to know someone and say you're in love.

I'm in the same situation, only the distance is different. She's in Arizona, I'm in Arkansas. To be completely honest, I don't know if long-distance relationships are smart to do. I like the girl, and I'm sure you like this guy from Canada too, but I don't really think these kinds of things last. It's the need for physical touch that makes it difficult. If you think you can last until a time you can meet up with each other, then I say go for it. Otherwise I would tell him what's up and move on.|`|nM8eelmAaa	i know what you mean..my mom is going through the same thing right now..but we are futher away..and you know what forget the people that say oh its only been a month and you love him? love has no time limit.. when you love someone you love them, and when you havent met him yet and you only talk to him that means you know you love him for him and not what he looks like or anything else that people fall in love with you know.. people think they are in love because they like the way someone looks or their sex or all these other little things.. when in reality you need to fall in love with the person for who they are not what they are..and thats exactly what you are doing.<br>  <br>  but whatever you decide yo do..i wish you the best of luck :)|`|H1zusQ8raa	Right thats consider lust not love in under a month your basically selling yourself short.......I believe in love at first sight...but theres a catch to that you may not fall in love once you get to know that person.  So keep an open mind for someone that you can have a real relationship.  I dont think long distance is very good unless you wer together for some time before departure.|`|J2S0OiDNaa	hahahahahahahahaha!<br>  Ok hunny I've tried that **** trust me many many times I have tried that it always seems like the greatest people live too far away dont it?Its not going to last your never going to see them contact or not you live in 2 different places in the world how can you have a relationship with someone you cant even spend time with and get to know them in person...I wasted alot of time dating girls from the UK and Canada and Across the United states it just dont work and the sooner you realize it youll be better off i know i am i found a girl thats close enough to see yet still far enough away that no one i know knows her|`|nbv6Z01iaa	If you can handle the long distance without infidelity then go for it.  Do you ever get to see each other?  The better question is have you ever seen one another.  Maybe you could stick it out for a while and then make a larger commitment like moving in together.|`|PA11NoYDaa	For one it takes years to know you love someone.

Ag8pE3Cyaa	Listen to me. <br>  <br>  At 20 I married a man that was into hockey. He played it, watched it, worshiped it. When he was not home on hockey night he would program the vcr to record it, that's how crazy he was. Eventually it lead us to a divorce. For 12 years him and I never went anywhere on a Saturday night because it's hockey night, we never went on get away weekends cause he would miss his hockey practice and matches. Because of this damn dependence to hockey we never built memories together like any other normal families!<br>  <br>  She and your child are suppose to be the most important thing in your life, even before soccer. If you can't control your dependency to this sport then you're not mature enough to be a family man.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	i do not blame her. you need to grow up and take care of your pregnant wife. she should mean more to you than soccer.  she needs you right now the soccer can wait. you have a family now and when the baby is born he or she will need you.  you do not have to give soccer all together you can still play maybe 1 weekend a month.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Sounds like you will be divorced soon.  I like the game of soccer and spent thousands of dollars and miles for my son to play over the years but it is only a small part of life.  Ignore your wife and someone else will give her the attention she is looking for.  Grow up, there is a lot more to life than any game.|`|YdjU4KqBaa	i think the question is to you .. would you prefer to divorce your pregnant wife or soccer|`|VnRECJJxaa	you are an idiot if you just chose soccer over your pregnant wife|`|FCcbgriuaa	The soccer is not the problem! The problem is you not spending time with her, she married you to spend her life and share things with you. Your being very selfish, specially when she's expecting a baby. She needs all the attention right now. You could always record your soccer game and watch it later. If you love her and care for your child you will make some sacrifice. Grow up life it's not all about soccer. that's cool that you like it but do you love it more then your marriage life, wife and baby?|`|d8pt9KMyaa	why don't you just  get a mistress like everyone else : )   at least she can keep you warm at night.|`|kxUigIkraa	Basically, you are being shockingly immature for someone who is 23. The woman is pregnant. Give her a break. Plenty of guys do without some things to keep a pregnant lady happy. We get emotional. It's not really our fault either. You would be extra sensitive too if you were so big that you could never sleep well, smells make you vomit, hormones are surging all over the place. Just get over yourself for one stupid month and show the poor gal your support. And when you said, "I love soccer more than anything, no exaggerating." That is just bad prioritizing. Your wife should always come first. Having a hobby is healthy, but obsession just plain isn't. You don't have to give up soccer forever. Just stop it with the soccer for a little while so that you can convince her that she is the new number one priority in your life. Once she is secure in her importance to you (and not only her, but really this could be about nerves with having a baby soon too), she will definitely be ok with sharing you with soccer again.  She is not asking for something crazy. That is how marriage works.|`|875b9562d8defd3804154e34c3bf5ea4aa	This is silly. You enjoy the sport, it's a great passion of yours. But obviously your wife feels like you enjoy it more than her. It goes Beyond having a hobby, it's about compromise.<br>  It's stupid to get divorced over something like this. BOTH of you need to give the other one a little slack. She needs to be more understand with you, and you with her.|`|e1oky4jSaa	She is 8 months pregnant and is very hormonal. You need to pay more attention to her and make her feel special, at 8 months pregnant I felt like a beached whale! Just be caring and attentive, and I'm sure she wont mind if you retreat to soccer for a bit after babe is born. Just don't be too excessive about it.|`|zMg4hQwDaa	you are superficial, will soccer take care of you when your old, or be there for you? Its okay for a child to say this but not an adult. <br>  She should leave you, because you took something that's a hobby too far. You are no better than a drug addict that wont give up the addiction. grow up.|`|77fbbb1d9999a5a9e6e6781a763a28aeaa	well i LOVE soccer too. But you have to think of it this way your the dad of the baby and you need to be around for that too. so just make a deal with her. you spend time with her doing things that she enjoys and you do the same.|`|7VGU0uZQaa	Did she not no this when u got married, I think she needs to let it be. On the other hand u do need to make her feel as if u love more then the sport, u do have a baby on the way and they both need you...|`|USooqQlWaa	Just picture her head as a soccer ball.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	SHE WANTS A HUSBAND THAT CARES ABOUT HER AS MUCH HE DOES SOCCER!! helllooo your about to have a child GROW UP!!

It seems to me that she should have been well aware of your love of soccer prior to marrying you.  Unless you married at the age of 5.  she accepted it before the marriage, it's too late to change things now.  I will give her the benefit of the doubt that the pregnancy thing is adding to the problem and maybe it's making her insecure.  I find it complete BS that a woman will demand you to choose.  Especially since it's a sport!  It's not like you are hanging out at strip bars.  Put more effort into your relationship and making her feel better.|`|BUET39wmaa	she is a realy selfish broad to do this to you.<br>  you lived like this when she married you and now she wants you to change.<br>  don't worry buddy after your baby is born you will have lots of free time to play soccer because that self-centered stupid will devote all her time to the baby and leave you out in the cold.<br>  guaranteed.<br>  <br>  good luck with all that|`|7MJSPGnhaa	Really?  Seriously?  A sport on the television is more an important than a living breathing human being that you promised to love, honor and cherish until death parted you?  And what about your unborn child?  Will she also take a back seat to your selfish love of a sport that can't love you back?<br>  <br>  Get your priorities straight!! You are immature and honestly have no business being married.|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	Well, I'm thinking you are way to immature to either be married or having a child.  Anyone who would pick a sport over his family is an idiot.  I don't care how much you "love" the sport.  I'm sure you can come to a happy medium, but it sould mean some COMPROMISE.  It's a word that mature enough to be married couples know very well!|`|qVL5R8nuaa	Your wife is 8 months pregnant. You want to choose soccer over her? She needs your love and attention especially at a time like this. She needs to know that she is the most important person in the world. It doesn't matter if you are Diego Maradona, you should get on your knees and beg her to come back to you.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	dude, you're already married to soccer.  I wouldn't have continued dating you, let alone married you.  You have no room in your life for anyone or anything expect your sport.<br>  <br>  we all have choices to make.  If you want your wife and child then you'll have to scale back on the soccer and make room for them.|`|LRvjfQyhaa	Your wife is about to have your child.  Would it kill you to miss a soccer game or two and just be with her?  Chances are it's her hormones talking, but I can't say that I blame her for being angry at you.
PA11NoYDaa	It really depends on your maturity level. For an average 15 year old I would say that dating os ok as long as its kept casual, meaning no sexual relationship qquite yet and it doesnt get serious. Your friends and family and school should be more important since your family and your education will be around forever and hopefully some of those friends will too. At 15 you both have so much growing up to do and changing that the chances of staying with any guy you meet right now are slim no matter how much you think you love him. So date and have fun but nothing more than that..|`|yIgd5vDAaa	No, i think 15 is about the age when most people start dating.<br>  i think like, 13 and 14 is too young, seeing as at that age most don't even know how to handle their own emotions, much less someone else's.<br>  <br>  But i say go for it. :)|`|JXrvbW7caa	No, you're not too young.|`|XMXgeJPFaa	not too young but have fun and dont miss out on life and your friends.  younger kids tend to make relationship too much of a priority and miss out on what high school has to offer and the time you spend with friends gets shorter.  You shouldn't be stressing over it just go with it.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	no just keep it PG-13. You may feel like you know what you're doing, but getting pregnant or getting an STD is easy.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	yes|`|jLLkSWyiaa	so whats your question?|`|lwFgDJlHaa	it all depends on the maturity of the person.<br>  If you there is a difference Between "dating" and being in a "relationship".<br>  If you just want to have a boyfriend and have fun while you are young.go ahead. just make sure you actually DO know what you are doing so you dont get takin advantage of.<br>  you are at the age where the most teenage girls are takin advantage of because they are so young and do not have all the experience in life situations.<br>  -I think you do need to be careful but have fun with dating, but safely.you WILL gain the dating experience needed later in life.|`|7c2cd1dbc4d071687fc07457c1a3cb92aa	I agree. Just, the more serious it gets (emotionally), the more risk there is of you geting hurt. Don't try to be "in love" with someone at 15 or 16. And remember to use condoms.|`|oQcDZI9Daa	you're not too young to date... i started dating when i was 15.  i also lost my virginity at 15, which i wouldnt recommend doing.|`|S41nRFKKaa	Everybody thinks they know what they're doing.<br>  And yet, almost nobody actually does.|`|jC9J0Ctuaa	good try but yes you think you know but you really dont. People in their 20s and 30s are still learning ask any older woman or man, its a process that takes years to really undertand.|`|XKryj6dpaa	im 15 and i date ... actually ive been with my bf for 1 year :)|`|0756dc620f7e85830cd5e318d021d602aa	Your Old enough. Just don't do anything you wouldn't want your parents to find out about ;D|`|0lewWYJdaa	your not too young.|`|yIJzWavsaa	well at 15 you're kind of young to date because ur starting out in high school but if ur mature enough to know what the dating scene is like, you know conversation, having a good time, getting to know the other person better, being respectful thats what dating is. dont try settling right away for one person, remember there are many people to meet and the more respectful and mature you are to another people will get to know you and in time dating for you will be so easy and casual|`|6VdIvUhtaa	You may THINK you know what your doin (cuz all teenagers do, I did too when I was 1) but doesnt mean you do! But if you do, make sure you have an older accreditable person to guide you! Who you know wont guide you into doing things that arent the best thing for you. Who knows you well, and whose life isnt tainted with bad relationships themselves.|`|J2S0OiDNaa	Ummm no I didnt know there was a such thing as too young...just dont get too serious till your older highschool you'll just get hurt 9 times out of 10|`|Vr7NR2LGaa	no its not. im 14 & i've been dating for awhile. just dont have sex & you'll be fine. but dont let the guy make you grow up to fast, move at your own speed.|`|vzEUP1fdaa	I dont think you're too young.. just not old enough to have a serious relationship.. that's all.|`|GUlFatGZaa	I don't think so. If you know what you're doing and feel comfortable - go for it! Just be safe ;-)|`|3V2eZzbLaa	nooo.<br>  i started datin when i was like 10.<br>  soo go for it.
4X1uF6w2aa	Your fooling yourself. You obviously dont feel as strongly for your girlfriend as you are trying to tell yourself you do. If you did then you wouldnt be asking the question and certainley wouldnt be thinking about your co-worker like this. <br>  I think the kindest thing you should do is break up with your girlfriend to save her from any more hurt and then seriously think about what you want!|`|WlLcttM2aa	It's not fair to have them both unless they both know and are okay with you having both of them. Who do you want more?|`|FknQXMzRaa	This is why most men cheat. Greed<br>  <br>   Be happy with the girlfriend you have now.<br>  <br>  It says in the bible 'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife' . Stop drooling over other guy's girlfriends|`|nbv6Z01iaa	Is it so hard for you to keep her as a friend because the two of you are similar?  I don't believe that office relationships do not work.  If you like her more than your current girlfriend than maybe it is time to move on.  2 years is not a life time, but it is an investment.  Which one do you see yourself with in 5 years.  Think of long term.  If you are questioning your current relationship than maybe you are not meant to be in it.|`|51843c451ddb1dc1decc4f236d232ca8aa	At 2 years into a relationship with your current GF there should be an idea in your head if the relationship is going to last. Do you picture you both together forever married with kids/animals?? If you answered yes to that question then just be friends with your co-worker. Its not always a good idea to date a co-worker because of the whole romantic aspect. Now if you answered no then you both should agree to dump you other halves and go out. Just don't be a cheater thats the worst thing to do. You could always be best friends with the co-worker.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Don't cheat on your girl, if you want to bang someone else break up with her first and don't use the fact that "there are things you hate about your GF" as an excuse to cheat on her or as a way to blame her for the failure of the relationship.. this is all your doing. <br>  <br>  If you loved your GF you wouldn't be shmoozing with this other girl you work with for kicks. <br>  <br>  When you meet a new person they always seem great, just like i am sure you thought your gf was when you first met her.  Now you're tired of your gf and think this new chick is sooo perfect.   But think about this, if she's such a great catch why is she going around flirting with other guys when she has a boyfriend already? You really do have lots in common don't ya, like lack of loyalty to the people you are with.|`|fa7e17ae5e79327378e35d3394cfed94aa	It's never good to mix business with pleasure. I had a relationship with an old co-worker and it was not the ideal situation you would expect. Unless you're willing to quit, break up with your girlfriend and have her break up with her boyfriend, then you can figure out if that's all worth being together or not. Good luck!
SOv6I9Wfaa	I didn't look at your video because your private business is not my business and I am not interested. However, I can't help wondering whether posting that private video on a very public forum "Hey everyone, look at me, me, me - hey Mom, look at me!" might have something to do with her annoyance. Not everyone feels that any attention is better than no attention.|`|BhlGe0A8aa	It doesn't work sweetie !<br>  perhaps you should try again-i would really like to see it.!|`|Vm0iVpYPaa	Sorry hunn the link wouldn't work it said malformed video!!!<br>  <br>  Try talking to ur mum and explain y you made this video or make one for ur mum too.

EPaYoJaiaa	I would probably think that he wasn't really ready for marriage and that he only asked me so as not to risk losing me just because he's not ready yet after 5 years.<br>  I would sit him down and ask him to tell me the honest to God truth about why he asked to marry me but then when I ask him about wedding plans he feels pressured. If he's not ready I would personally wait for him till he was and that he doesn't have to fear losing me because of some stupid society's rules or other girls advice to me or whatever. We would have a very long talk and figure things out like two adults should.|`|xZ6UY0araa	Give him back the ring. Hes not ready, he probably just said it to make you happy. If it was me i would tell him how i feel. and if he doesn't listen he is definitely not ready and maybe not that committed to making it work.|`|nqyDxAleaa	I would begin to assume that he doesn't want to be committed to be like I'd like to be committed to him. If a guy beats around the bush about moving forward in a relationship whether it may be becoming more serious or marriage in general then he's not on the same page as you are.|`|mDYPgjiWaa	just act like u dont care they'll come around and want more from you i mean other then getting married you are pretty much at the limit of any relasionship 5 years is a long time same with me and my bf 5 years this year lol dosent seem long at all lol|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Call off the engagement.

MXjvZMUXaa	What's up with the spam?|`|oFUqegjfaa	Tell the exchange student that you and the girl have never hung out and do not get along. It would then be up to her if she wants to hang out with her.  Don't ever be friends with someone if you already know they're using you.|`|41b5520f22fb7c31c977577d29ab1905aa	Don't allow yourself to be used. If Emily wants to befriend the exchange student then let her on her own. Don't introduce them when you know that you are being used. Why put yourself in that situation? However, you do have to understand that if Emily and the exchange student happens to become close friends that you may be outside of that circle. Hopefully, since the exchange student is staying at your house, you two have or will develop a close relationship and loyalty will be of most priority for the exchange student. Also, don't speak bad about Emily to the exchange student. Just forget it and let it go.|`|9604dad549d1d9ec19f7dbd9698567fdaa	I would tell the exchange student what Emily is doing to me and let the exchange student decide if she wants to still hang out with Emily, and if she does, then she might see the kind of person Emily really is for herself. Dont sweat it. Friends come and go, but the real ones are always there for u. There are people around the world that r starving, have no where to live, suffering from sicknes, u need not waste your time and worry about little things like this.

AA11481603	What a mess. Well, unless you sponsored your SIL, you have no legal obligation to her, but as your wife's sister, you do have a family obligation. You say she hasn't pulled her weight since coming here. The question is, what does your wife think about it? Nothing says you have to help someone who won't help themselves, but you will have to answer to an unhappy spouse. Make sure first that you and your wife are on the same page about your SIL first. Next, about the relationship of your SIL and neighbor. He sounds likes a buddy of yours, seeing that you've hung out together and gone to his  parent's house. Saying he's a great guy when he's sober doesn't say much about him. If he is an abusive alcoholic (as it sounds), then things are likely to escalate. Your family relationship with your SIL is going to pull you into it as much as proximity, so avoiding it will not help. However, you would not be wise to butt in and give advice either. I would talk to your wife about it, since you both know whats going on. <br>  <br>  See how she feels about the situation and honestly tell her what you can and cannot do. What I mean, is, if you think that encouraging her sister to get out of a bad relationship will mean moving back in with you, which I assume you don't want, then tell that to your wife. Back your reasoning up with specific events, such as not working, etc. The thing is, your own relationship is your primary concern and you will likely be a part of whatever goes on with your SIL because of it. Do not confront a drunken bully either. This will be tough.<br>  <br>  After reading others answers, I would say DO NOT allow your SIL back in your home if she refuses to work, etc, even with a time limit. The thing is, with relatives, once they're in, time limits are out the window. Period.|`|PA7kYyAxaa	If he's violent, get a temprary restrainng order. Get your sis in law out of your life, too.|`|0LSLXwWVaa	Honey, I feel for you. But you are not responsible for your sisters' choices, even if you did introduce them. Furthermore, if she wants to stay in an abusive relationship, there isn't much you can do. But you could pack up your family and move. & take her with you or leave her behind. Tell your wife to explain to her that your concerned for her and that you care for her. That she shouldn't allow anyone to beat on her. Maybe, think about telling her boyfriend that he shouldn't hit her and perhaps he needs help, AA perhaps? Maybe you should think of going to a support group to help you deal with the frustration brought about by this relationship. I feel for you, really, because I know that when the crap hits the fan, your sister in law is going to end up at your doorstep and her boyfriend will also bring the trouble to your door. He needs to stop drinking & she needs to get a life. You need to sort of mind your own so that you don't get lost in this rumble. I hope you find some peace.Oh! and, btw, don't go kicking the guy's behind. You'll only end up having another problem you really don't need. Really, just be cordial towards him. Hi and By. Otherwise you could cause more problems.|`|34550d5f2dff52eadb5794f5944a6de1aa	Oh my gosh.  this is not an easy situation for you or for your wife. A drinker has to be dealt with severely for their own good.  Do not tell him that you know about the abuse. He will take it out on your wife's sister.  I would sit him down, and tell him what you dont like about him when he has been drinking. Dont ignore him, as you are the better person, but also dont get over friendly. Unless he changes for the better.  Its known that drinkers have a really good side to them, and that is what makes it so difficult. Dont blame yourself either, as you didnt force her to go and live there. They must get on with it, and you must be patient until he moves.  Things will turn around then. I hope everything works out for you.|`|9136WNCzaa	I'd punch him in the back of the neck/head area as hard as you can thus resulting in some sort of permanent brain injury.|`|CQsD09D6aa	Tell your wife everything that you just told us. Let her know how concerned you are for your sister-in-law's well being. Even though you do not really want to, offer temporary lodging at your place until she can stand on her own two feet. Give your SIL  a deadline and let her know that you are serious. Offer her assistance in getting a job and acquiring job skills.  She is family and you should help get her away from an abuser. It doesn't matter that he only acts up when drunk.|`|b34a54682dc09f70279f26554322d78aaa	I think the answer relies on your wife's relationship with her sister.  <br>  I am sure it is very heartbreaking for your wife to see this too and have you talked to her about this? I mean, what is her opinion? After all it is her sister.  She (your wife's sister) should be the one that makes a decision, and end this abusive relationship with this guy. You can try to help him by telling him that he needs anger management ... but I do think that your wife's sister is the only person who can end this. Tell her to grow up!|`|KKCMIE04aa	Tell him to quit drinking and go to anger mgmt, then duck and run. <br>  Talk with your wife because any decision made will need her full support. I would gradually cut them out my social schedule. I'm sure you can come up with your own problems if you aren't distracted by the neighbors. Say good bye.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Your question is a lot like asking, "It really hurts when I keep putting my hand on a hot stove.  What should I do?"<br>  <br>  Answer: stop doing the painful thing!  Avoid the guy.  He is not your problem.<br>  <br>  As for your SIL, you need some serious practice in not being so judgmental.  Whether or not she works, gets a driver's license, etc., is well and truly none of your business.|`|AUsvrW8faa	It seems like you've done enough and you need to stay out of it.  If you do anything tell your wife to tell her sister to get it together. It sounds like she'll be back at your house shortly.  If you don't want that to happen, you have to tell your wife and ask her to tell her sister to get a job and get her license - she needs to tell her she's got to get prepared to get a place on her own(roommate or whatever), but she's not going to be able to stay with the 2 of you.  If you decide to let her stay, it should be on a time limit- a couple months then she has to go. She's got to start getting prepared for that day right now. I totally understand helping out because everybody needs that (including me), but if you all keep taking care of her, why should she do anything to take care of herself?|`|UU1YR1Kaaa	If your wife's sister is getting beat up and you know there is proof, I would call the police the next time there is an occurrence, you can call anonymous as a concerned citizen.  Then, I would talk to your wife, and tell her that you really suspect that he is beating her.  If you don't then he will continue to beat on her until someday she will be dead.  I have seen allot of abuse cases.  The thing that needs to be done is an intervention with him, he does need help, but he has to decide to get help, and he must decide if he wants to change.|`|hE6Z93Ysaa	Well I really don't know how to tell you to get out of this one, its quite allot to deal with.  In the future let people find their own situations and don't get involved.  You can only talk to the guy across the street when he's sober.  You should cut off all ties with him and the sis.  If he asks why tell him nicely when he's sober.  Don't tell him about the problems you know about with the sis because you could endanger her.  If you could get her to move away it would be ideal.  Trouble is when she's there he's there so tread lightly.  She sounds like the biggest loser on earth, just be glad you got the good sister.  Good luck to you.|`|scnW0Wzeaa	I would confront the drunk. If he gets mad Too bad. The sister should go to Bartender school. She can get a job in the bar. Find some Bloke in Boca Raton to take care of her.
MXjvZMUXaa	You shouldn't care either. They're just calling you names because they think it's fun to piss you off. So try not to listen to them... Just tell them that everything they say to you goes in one ear and comes out the other and that you don't give a damn about them.|`|oFUqegjfaa	I hate this kind of situation because you feel like no one is feeling your pain.  I'm sorry. If there is another way to travel, take it. The bus driver should be helping. If anything, tell the principal on HER!!|`|41b5520f22fb7c31c977577d29ab1905aa	You just have to find strength. I went through this from the beginning of school until about the 8th or 9th grade and I am 29 years old now. I still remember some of the hurtful things people would say about me. I know they say words will never hurt but they do. Words hurt more than the actual fighting sometimes. Anyway, you have done all that you could regarding the school. Have you talked to your parent (s) about it? If not, then you should. If you have a best friend or someone you trust, go to them about it. I never told anyone about it because I was afraid of retaliation but around the 8th grade I became fearless and started fighting and fighting is never the best option. However, look at it this way you are in the 11th grade and soon you will be done with high school. If you can go without taking the bus, then don't. I just don't want you to give up on yourself because of a few people. I know it is hard but it does get better and these people just don't have anything better to do. Also, you may want to start going back and forth with them. When they check (talk about you), check them back. Just don't be afraid. Also, go to the principal again or your counselor and tell your mom and/or dad about it.|`|Bu4n8YdEaa	ignore them, they are getting satisfaction from knowing they can affect you.  listen to music and ignore their comments, unless they physically get in your face, then just ignore them.  If they touch you, then you can take action against them for physical assault.  Certain things they say can also be considered defamation of Character, and you can sue them.  If you have a family lawyer, you can have them send a letter to them and threaten legal action if they continue to defame your character.|`|O3CPESX1aa	Of course it hurts. But the more you pay attention to them the more they will do. Perhaps if you just don't listen and act like you don't care it will stop. There opinion don't count anyway. You know who you are by now. I personally would not accept any one BS from them. I just would go on with my life. They don't have one. I'd by hangy if they'd have mine.|`|MVVCMj6Haa	ok this is what you do get buck with them .just be like leave me the hell alon you f#@kin idiots get a got damn life ....have the meanest face on mean buisness|`|qi52nTmDaa	Hunny you have to tell the bus driver directly. I have had a similar problem. Not name calling just harassment from an ex bf, but I went tough the same thing telling the school whom did absolutely nothing about it because they apparently had better things to do. So go ahead and try to get your bus driver alone, and if you are not comfortable doing that, write a letter to them. I am positive he or she will then take some action. If this still doesn't work, tell your parents or guardians and ask them to take this issue directly to the school. Sometimes a parent will actually scare them to do something about this situation rather than hearing it from a student as sad as it sounds. Best of luck to you.
kfM7ppWpaa	Here is what I did for my lady one time:<br>  <br>  Print out a poem.<br>  Buy a Dozen Roses and some rose petals.<br>  Cut the poem out in 12 sections.<br>  Cut the stems in half on each rose.<br>  Attach the pieces of the poem to each rose stem, keeping them in order.<br>  Take and give him one personally at work, then put one on the windshield of his vehicle. Go home and put one on the front door. Then leave some w/ the rose petals on the floor, leading to the bathroom. Draw a bubble bath, have some romantic music playing, and be waiting for him IN the bathtub.<br>  <br>  This should make for a romantic night. Hope it helps!|`|Ga29gevoaa	Why are you asking this?

7Q6edIEoaa	First off if you feel the need to defend yourself because of what others are going to call you due to your situation right there is your first clue. you need to let the situation alone, he has a girlfriend. Whether or not he is giving you signs.. he's off limits to you. Do you really want to be with a guy who let's his girlfriend push him around? He doesn't even have enough in him to leave her. that right there says it all!|`|ks2oieV0aa	I'm not sure, is this someone you see on a regular bases?  Do you talk in person?  Or is this just one of those internet things?  How could he possible really LOVE you when he has a girlfriend?  I'm not trying to sound cruel, but he has no concept of what it means to Love someone.  Not you or his girlfriend.  Enjoy your Youth and don't take things to serious!  xox|`|AA11108018	In order to avoid problems with luring him away and him having regrets and miss his ex,  Move on find someone who is not attached|`|CaRKCpMqaa	Leave it. Never ruin someone else's relationship no matter whether he says he's not happy or not. This guy obviously likes you if he tells you such things about his girlfriend, but a lot of guys do this, when truly there is nothing wrong with there relationship he just wants to appear more available to someone he likes.<br>  Leave it, never intrude intosomeone else's relationship.|`|6E81yM9Eaa	Get over it okay because if you dont like him then dont worry, if you do then am more than sure you will show that|`|j1akZve5aa	slap his fro!|`|71e4c99bdb3d30e1e3a590d2a8520a6daa	hes trying to just mess with  u  go away from him|`|tYO2Ir1oaa	My advice is to leave it well alone. If he decides to leave the relationship for his own reasons and later approaches you, then fine. But please don't try and dabble in someone else's relationship or encourage someone to cheat. If, later, you ended up together you would never fully trust him, knowing in your head how the two of you ended up together.|`|Ies8naFgaa	Hey just tell him that its not right how his gf is treating him no matter if she does have him on lock he should relize that she really doesn't love him like he loves her just tell him that and then he will be think about it, eventually he well make the right chose. There and then that willl be ur moment!!!! GOOOD LUcK <3 =)|`|GsRpZJX5aa	your   a       h o e<br>  <br>  first of all he sounds lik a jerk if he is sending you mixed signs when he<br>  has a gf<br>  <br>  you shouldnt be talking to him and flirting which you r probably doing<br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  <br>  stay out of their relationship|`|bHcjc9Q0aa	it sounds like u have a crush on him but u dont need to go to fast and ruin any chances u may have. just be urself and dont try and impress him. it always ends up bad if u do that|`|OflbswHKaa	If it happens, then it happens. But don't ruin the relationship. Most likely he will break up with her, and then he's fair game.|`|mrD6GfTSaa	Well leave him alone!<br>  Im saying this b.c. if you dont it will cause<br>   drama out the a$$ ,say he does leave her for you <br>  shell come back and it will just be non-stop drama<br>  leave em alone ...|`|BosXJUoFaa	b****<br>  stop trying to steal other peoples boyfriends|`|AA10989335	This sounds like an unhealthy relationship. I don't think its appropriate  to continue to spend time with this boy if he has a girlfriend if your feelings for him continue to grow. You are setting yourself up to get knocked down. I know its hard, but I promise you will get to the point that you will not be able to take it, because your feelings will develop to a point that it'll drive you crazy that they are together. And the fact of the matter is she was in his life first, and will remain there until HE decides to move on, with you, or someone else.|`|Cu4Accaxaa	if the signs are confusing then he is confused.<br>  If you know he is not going to leave her then you need to move on and not give him that much importance, he is confused and will do anything so long as you believe he is suffering and confused. don't do anything w/him unless you want to get hurt. Walk away!!|`|8c77eef5469f7de8cbd762ca530b165baa	some guys just need to have a female to vent to. just because he tells u negative things about his girlfriend doesn't mean he wants to end it with her.  he's looking maybe for your thoughts as to if you were acting like this and wants to know why maybe a female might act in this fashion. remember he said he really loves her|`|xKZTQ3Iyaa	Well girl I say go for it let him know how you feel if you like him at least and well if she is doing all that then you need to open his eyes and let him know wazz really good girl.|`|Ho2WCe9aaa	Well, this is a very confusing question.  I think you should be like Edward Cullen and leave him alone, because it means when a guy does this (good or bad) he's a player.|`|6a3e68591559079347d376d3ad8f42c0aa	Well ask him can he tell you the truth in then from there be honest with him.Just him some time to gather his thoughts.|`|VGsr4e5naa	Girl i think this guy is playing with you.. dont let him. if ever ask him to prove himself first.|`|qe4y8irpaa	show the other girl he's yours fight for him dont be afraid girl
vffZ3is4aa	When you two are sitting somewhere private. side by side. reach over and place your hand on his thigh. move your hand up and down, giving his thigh small squeezes once in a while. Turn and give him a kiss. Yes, with tongue. reach for his belt and undo it, by now he knows what you are doing and may help. undo his top button, and unzip his pants. yes he is hard, has been since you put your hand on his thigh. Slip down onto the floor between his legs. pull his pants down. then pull his underwear down. reach up and take a hold of his pen*is.look at his sack, touch it and watch the skin crawl. you can feel around with several fingers and feel his nuts. caution! do not squeeze them! you can cup the sack and squeeze GENTLY. by this time he will be going crazy. look at his pen*is. if there is a loose covering on the head (foreskin), pull it back gently, it will expose the head. you now have the option to finish him by hand, mouth, or telling him you are done, he can put it away, the last option is not recommended. if you decide to finish him by hand, have something handy to catch the fruits of your labor. good luck|`|U8oR3VU6aa	About the only way to do this is to come right out and ask. It will be awkward, but the alternative is to wait until you have sex, get used to one another, start feeling comfortable naked, so just ask him. That is probably why he keeps talking about it--to get you curious.|`|XsYrhdY2aa	You are messed the fuc%ed up lady|`|LYnK4xb0aa	plant a big lip lock on him and get a handfull|`|c5COgNGaaa	just simply say "you know the other day when i told you that you didn't have balls??" be like, "well, i still dont believe you, ahaha!" then that will bring it up again. simple as that. once its brought up again just keep talking about it until he shows you. lol that should work. good luck!|`|yt2zVOZfaa	You should say "Hey I heard from your friends that you have a lower than average penis." Of course he'll totally deny it and might just show you if you keep on insisting that it's small.|`|K8wDgNwbaa	say "show me you balls"|`|bda90c576f1d500516702950d3dbb7ffaa	Well he brought it up.

It should come natural.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|b0jxIc2yaa	well i grab around there hair while he holds me against him...
C8DOT8Y7aa	Remember, it takes two to tango. Did she have a reason why she did this? Think of reasons why, and come up with conclusions. Thinking about it will get the motor running. <br>  What is this other guy like? Is he the macho type? If he is, then shes shallow and you deserve better. If hes the sweetheart type, then he probably won her over with words. <br>  Take time to relax and enjoy life. There's more to life than that girl you loved. <br>  Talk to her about it. Find out why she did it. Was there something missing in the relationship? Think of things that might have been left out. Talk to her and see if there is any way to fill in any gaps. <br>  Don't under any circumstance, go out and stomp the guy. If you want the girl back, don't do that. This will guarantee her slipping farther away from you. <br>  Listen to some good music. Not the hardcore depressing ones, but the ones that can relax you. <br>  Usually, guys get over girls by drinking, smoking, or doing drugs, but try working out or exercising. It'll do you a lot of good.|`|Oz0h1TXwaa	Wow, weird.<br>  Get another girlfriend.|`|HGpaOwuEaa	umm, well i was kinda in the same situation. no. she wants you but maybe she doesn't want to play games and buy you saying no that was a game. you need to make sure that she knows how you feel and that your not playing games. dude she never had you to get over you. she could also be embarrassed that you rejected her...make she she know that you were the fool....make sure everyone know.<br>  <br>  good luck man.|`|Z4Xliw8zaa	You are retarded.

djUMvICoaa	He came home to a great party, huh, and you are going to have a little gift for him when he gets home, how wonderful.  You haven't changed, have you?  You are still the one he thinks of and him for you?   Just remember the love and everything will be O.K.  Wanting to look nice is O.K., but I bet he just misses you.  And any guy who gets down on his wife for what happens to her body while carrying his kid is an idiot in my book.  But I still understand you wanting to look nice and as long as you have that as a goal you will get there.  But he isn't going to care about that, in a way it's different having something different around, I never had trouble with any of it.|`|coPtU10Laa	You ladies are always more judgemental of your looks than us guys are.

Because you can never please anyone even if you give up your life for them.  I think you should not care about your body and why should you be because you are giving him a happiness that no otehr woman can give him.  Especially the ones who look very sexy and have a very good physique.  Whenever my husband says anything about my body after a baby it makes me feel very bad but not anymore because I think that the models that he sees on the TV won't like to put thier future on stake and would give him this happiness.  If he truly loves you  then he won't care.  Would it botehr you if your husband gains weight and do not look sexy any more?  We women just want to please our hubbys and forget about ourselves and regret later on that why we did not care about ourselves.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It's normal to gain weight with pregnancy and everyone knows it so he's going to be expecting that it's no big deal. Just relax and don't stress out it's not good for the baby. You'll lose it after the baby is born and he knows that plus if he loves you it won't matter.|`|m81dfyOYaa	When I was pregnant the last thing on my mind was whether my husband would be dissatisfied with my body. We were both so happy about the pregnancy I actually enjoyed the changes. How would I be if I were in your shoes, thrilled to bits to get my husband back and for to him see our beautiful baby. There are some things in life that are more important than how you think you might look after a pregnancy. Anyway, you've got 5 months to lose any baby fat. Good Luck.
O5KwzStkaa	I've done that before. It's called a blood pact. And it is dangerous if the other person is sick or if there hand are dirty. Because if they have aids then by making a blood pact you yourself could get aid. Also if there or your hands are dirty then the dirt could get into your cut and give you an infection.|`|yrEQq2vsaa	if you cut your hand wrong you could criple your self too dont forget that.|`|kknCZkq0aa	yup it's dangerous. you could get any blood borne disease, like HIV or Hepatitis.

7fAHPUkkaa	when women say' they are holding out or he aint getting any' we stray|`|wXaGIPSPaa	There is so many reasons people cheat.  I meant that is like asking why someone gets married...there are way too many answers.  But if you are looking for one generalization, then I would have to say because they find themself in a situation where they loose control. <br>  Infidelity is a choice bottom line, but will power and self restraint are not enough we have to control the situations we are in. (ie being close to someone of the opp sex , 1:1 time with somone that is sexually interesting or interested in us, feeling lonely or disconnected etc from spouse and not tackling it, or just plain given an opportunity not to get caught)|`|6fd4e1a5aa0206bfc6a1ce509a0f2507aa	Maybe I'm too cynical, but if a man cheats he simply doesn't want to be accountable, doesn't take his relationship seriously and shouldn't be pretending to be in a relationship.<br>  Men or women who cheat should, in my opinion, be single and have lots of casual, shall we say, "get togethers", whatever that may be.<br>  I have never seen anyone get cheated on and it made their relationship better or either person get happier.<br>  Posers....that's what they are.|`|om3N441xaa	A shortage in the bedroom is a great contributor to many flings....|`|dm7gls1iaa	Who knows. Really.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I think cheating results from insecurity on some level.  They don't feel sexy anymore, or they feel under appreciated, or they put themselves in situations that get out of hand and don't have the guts to stop.  I think if they liked the other person better, they would just leave their partner.  Usually they just like a single aspect of the other person that their partner doesn't have.  Like they're really sexy, or they listen well.|`|Ar2XADGOaa	There are many issues that can contribute:  Lack of common interests, lack of personal time together, lack of sex, large debt or unable to pay bills, feeling unappreciated or unloved, not being attracted anymore, lack of communication the list goes on.|`|djUMvICoaa	I guess they found their thing in someone else they like better.|`|tawgKlOpaa	Your beauty and wit astonishes me!<br>  I love you!|`|WewCtMpzaa	Many reasons, but I suspect that many are sucked into it by trying to be the good guy for wanting to help women in trouble, and get caught up liking them. Building up emotions, and then desires.<br>  <br>  A good number are just for sex.<br>  <br>  Then there is that group that have bad or no sex with the wife, which might be just for sex again, but they have more inspiration due to a lack of sexual activity.

Dx9h0qkFaa	You should take the initiative and ask the friends that you hang out with at school to do something. Maybe go to a movie or something and once you start to hang out with those people you might feel as if you belong to a group.You seem like you are a pretty friendly person so it should be pretty easy to make better relationships with the friends who you aren't that close to yet.|`|d2da7e64032883f337805711b0c2a360aa	when i was in high school too, i just didn't like to hang out with people because i was too busy for it..or my parents were really overprotrctive of me so i wasn't allowed to hang out with my friends..i actually really didn't mind cuz even though i had a lot of friends, i liked to keep to myself just because i felt like it..now that im in college, i like getting to know more people and hanging out with them and my parents have become less overprotective..i still don't really like going to parties and all that types of stuff, but i've become less shy and have made a lot more friends..hope this helps! :)|`|HqKQSJ5naa	Do a sport no matter what it is.  If its football or tennis or cross country or track.  People will meet you and you will have a team no matter what team it is its still people.  <br>  <br>  I didn't have much to do so I joined the football and track and wrestling teams.  I've met a lot of new people some of the best coaches that changed my life.  <br>  <br>  I'd like to know your reasons for not hanging out with your "friends."  Be nice to people and think positive.  There's no good enough reason to not hangout with your friends.  That reason needs to be fixed you obviously need to open up to someone important to you.|`|nPTdqsFkaa	OMG. I feel the same way brother :O! Basically all I do when i get home is do homework too and go on the computer. You're not alone~ x] Hehe. I have my reasons why I can't go out either. ~cough~ muslim girl and overprotective parents ~cough~ ;O! Well I don't really mind xD... Just start memorizing Qu'ran or do some good deeds and help around the house xD??...|`|7kga2aRBaa	i dont see anything wrong with the way you are.  you talk to people at school which is good.  but its all about what makes you happy.  many teenagers are actually just fine being within the comfort of their family.  i mean if you are happy and comfortable with your family, then seriously why not?  you can see your friends at school, and your family at home, its balanced.  if it does bother you though, then you can easily get together with those couple of close friends you have.  i dont have a group of friends either, i just talk to people in classes and have a few close friends who i hang out with on the weekend. i find a when im feeling lonely sometimes a good way to cope is to improve on stuff your good at.  find a hobby, like drawing, designing, music, a sport etc.. and work on that.  <br>  do what makes you happy :)|`|kRN7SPiyaa	um well I have something similar... I am just too busy to hang out.  What you should do is find a very close friend and everyone day of the week plan something.  Like every Thursday my close friend and I have a cooking night.  We make something bizarre like dessert pizza, lemon square-balls! It's a lot of fun.  Also, if you can't hang with friends or things are awkward have study groups or just stay at home and  focus on studies.  It does get better.  Everyone (even people who you think have no friends) always have someone to hang out with.  Just try to plan activities.|`|6AbXKQyJaa	I am the same way : also in highschool and 16 years old. I help my mom run a Daycare center at our house and thats kind of were i spend most of my time (with cute little kids). But i also have friends and a lot of family. You just have to find something that you like to do and dont feel to depressed , your life is way better compared to other people living in this earth. I dont hang out with anyone but my best friend i known since 7th grade and we just go to the mall or hang out at the beach but other than that i am pretty lame.

lHBSOcjeaa	in the way i see things, i think you should find out.<br>  there are many ways to do it. you shouldn't follow him and check him around, you should talk to him and ask him face to face. you've been with him for so long, so you'll be able to tell whether he is lying or not. don't ask him in a rude or bad manner, ask him if about it like nothing was happening, because if he isn't doing anything of that kind, he will get very upset. if you find that he's cheating on you, i think you should leave him. there's no point of being with someone who doesn't deserve you, and who doesn't appreciate you. and if he isn't being loyal to you, how do you expect him to be a good father and a good role model for your baby. i don't think you should worry of being a single mother because you can get a  lot of benefits from the government, child support, your family and friends, the father of your baby and his family too. you should love your baby and take really good care of him/she. your baby will give you hopes and energy to keep going and move on.<br>  <br>  happy birthday tomorrow.<br>  <br>  i hope and wish to go things for the best, and really wish you good luck. <br>  <br>  remember, this is MY point of view and what i think.<br>  you are the only one who make the decisions of the best of your life and the best for your baby.. <br>  <br>  think twice before decisions....... good luck :)|`|AA10092586	wow1 i would confront him and i am only 17 but i have seen my aunts go through alot.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	well obviously you didn't use condoms.  you got knocked up by a guy who you weren't married to and is cheating on you.  you wouldn't do anything that smart.|`|aXtwn7Usaa	well you are about to become parents and he needs to be  little more responsible, he needs to tell you where he goes and with who, its ok to check his cell phone, and just ask him, hey babe, i was looking inside your wallet for your card/anything and I saw some condoms, when did you buy them? you know just ask questions not yelling, just act normal and innocent and watch for his answer.

1NIFJaThaa	Well honey Im sorry to break it to you ,but yes. You are certainly laying the ground work for him to play away. Although it depends on the kind of man you married. If sex isn't a big issue , perhaps he's fine but don't take it for granted. Try to be the one to initiate and get things going. Out of curiosity you didn't say why sex stopped. Have you got a low libido, are you in the late stages of pregnancy , what is it really?<br>  <br>  You have to talk to your husband immediately on how to improve the sex life. Sex is important in a marriage and please don't let ANYONE tell you otherwise. If you don't satisfy your man someone out there would be more than happy to fill your shoes. Do you really want that. Believe me no wife does.|`|QKRHlpHoaa	Yes, sex is a crucial part of every single romantic relationship.  There is a problem, regardless of how well you two get along.

If sex is falling to the wayside, a guy will get weak when the opportunity presents itself.<br>  <br>  There are exceptions, but most will jump at some good sex, if they are in a no sex situations. The marriage in their minds is not as important or practically over anyways when sex goes south.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Yes. Number one reason. It's why 99% of us don't marry men.

Lack of sex is certainly an "ingredient" that leads to cheating, but it ain't the whole recipe.|`|hAz30eGVaa	Depends on the guy, but I think most likely the answer is YES|`|7fAHPUkkaa	yes|`|bea2c50e30c8c234aeb6e88e02424208aa	I think that's a common misconception. I think that's rarely the case.<br>  <br>  I think that people have affairs, because at some level, they aren't happy or satisfied with *themselves.* <br>  <br>  Saying "I don't get enough at home" is just an excuse. People think that going outside their marriage will........that the drama and excitement of an affair will fill that void within themselves, but it never does. It just makes them feel more empty, (not to mention destroying their relationships.)<br>  <br>  If a lack of sex were really the problem, they could simply get a divorce...("Logic! Why don't they teach logic in these schools?")<br>  <br>  Instead of blaming their partner or their marriage for being "inadequate," what they really need to do is look in the mirror. Find the things about themselves that they aren't happy with, then work to change them.|`|81hqHDKHaa	I never would so would not my partner.<br>  I even have told him we wouldnt be having much of sex after marriage, he was fine. He even supported me by saying how many other things we could do together and still have fun and spend the time together.<br>  I trust him more than myself.<br>  He would never cheat. He is first of too religious to do it. Second he says cheating is not for real man who respect their family. He says, hes got the brain over his down part. <br>  So i guess, it depends on the kind of man. If he respects his family and his promise, he would never think of it.<br>  But low man would do it. Yes.|`|jcXsclHYaa	In my opinion it could as I have seen it so many times. The marriage is about understanding. So if one part wants to have sex "all the time" and the other part "almost never" they should meet half way. Lack of sex, sadly, can lead to cheating in my opinion.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	a guy could bang his wife everyday and if some chick out of his league wants to screw him he would.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Depends on the guy's needs.

8NBq70JPaa	Send her flowers or a card. Tell her she is beautiful often. Make her laugh. Treat her like it was your first date every time.|`|FNi40XSaaa	Genuinely make an attempt to get along with and impress her family. Even if she hates them. Always ask her how her day went. Pay attention to her body language even if she says nothing is the matter. Be affectionate and make her feel beautiful. Learn something about what she is interested in, even if you think it's lame or boring. Don't forget to share your interests with her. Make sure any relationship you have is built on a solid foundation of friendship. If you wouldn't like her as a good friend, then you shouldn't like her as a girlfriend.|`|Q7XwBNMEaa	Support her and dont' be an asshole and let her finish talking|`|JNAWH590aa	I'm a guy.... But i can give advice.<br>  <br>  1.   Be willing to change, but only for yourself<br>  <br>  2."Good things come to those that wait". Not when it comes to women. Good things come to those that act!!! Remember that.<br>  <br>  3. Being totally agreeable is boring (i learned that the hard way)<br>  <br>  4. Don't ask questions that are designed to find out what "she" thinks of you.<br>  <br>  5. Life isn't fair and dating is a part of life. Dating, dealing with girls, isn't and isn't supposed to be fair. Get over it!|`|526fafb4a2990433e20d87f8d365ac7daa	Always offer to pick her up or drop her off- if she says no the first time its probably because she doesn't want to bother you, but ask again 10 minutes later because just in case she did change her mind and is too shy to ask you to get/drop her off, you'll make her feel better.
uRbeSOMwaa	she wants to get to know you, talk to her.<br>  :)|`|S3Mqe64Aaa	uuummmhhhhh...talk to her ?
NJSUK2l9aa	Treat her more cordially than before, and make her understand that it is better for us to be friend but not to be more which will spoil relation itself.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Just tell her that you're really sorry but you don't feel that way.<br>  <br>  She'll need some space and time to get over you though.
coyq5rZVaa	from the beginning there was great communication and she was flirting with you, but then she starts randomly flirting with some other guy.. she is a flirt and probably can't help herself. That makes you less special than you think you are to her. After you started ignoring her im sure she thought maybe you were mad at her for something and wasn't quite sure what. You say the communication has been bad, well if you want to pursue her that's up to you, but you have to communicate to her and send her signals that you are not into playing games. If you don't like her flirting with other guys, then maybe she isn't for you. Try to further observe how she acts around other guys to determine if she really is a flirt, and know that if you want to pursue her you can't keep ignoring her.|`|8yGOjz5Maa	hmm.  i wouldn't. Is she is such a flirt then you don't know what could happen if you went out!! She could easily cheat on you.  Also if she is timid to ask you what time it is, then just imagine what would happen if you went out!! I wouldn't.. there is other fish in the sea :]|`|KhfFeve9aa	Don't think. FEEL.

Don't go into it head first because it could ruin a relationship.|`|SOsoZgUIaa	well i think thats good because you guys are making the next level... <br>  <br>  but if you are having second thought about you moving in with girlfriend then maybe you should wait til you think its the time... or til you think you are ready...|`|CVVl4U4caa	I second Jose.|`|FnnyT1mlaa	I co-sign the first answer.|`|M961DkIjaa	It depends on how long you've been dating.

apbuHIJOaa	The only way you can truly know if a person has feelings for you is to ask. By asking, you can be sure the answer is sincere as it came directly from said person.<br>  - Acts mature/immature when you’re around<br>  - Allows you into "personal space"<br>  - Apologizes a lot<br>  - Asks friends about you<br>  - Asks who you like (often)<br>  - Backs you up (supports your thoughts, actions etc., stands up for you)<br>  - Becomes oddly itchy (scratches head, arm, neck, nose etc.)<br>  -

kRN7SPiyaa	hmm... be like her! lol<br>  <br>  Reverse psychology won't work here! sry... <br>  <br>  I would tell her, maybe in a note, that trying to be like someone else just helps them lose themselves... I would try to hang out with her and maybe even talk to her why she does this.  It is most likely to impress the guy that used to like you.  I would tell her that she should be herself.  Try to get to the core of her problem.  She has no self confidence in herself so she tries to be you.  Talk to her.  Maybe you are the answer|`|QdcmctmJaa	just tell her to stop. its easier to do on aim.

Blow him off.  You spent too much time waiting and money.  Never do that for any guy.|`|RFeYz59maa	Wow, he really pulled a number on you. You shouldn't be bothered with a guy like this. I think another girl is in the picture somewhere. Why else would he not show up to a date that he begged YOU for. I don't think you should go with him....unless he got in an accident or something else serious happened. Most likely, that won't be the case though but you never know. You know what, this is what you do....if he comes to the door listen to what he has to say and if he doesn't have an accurate excuse (you'll know) then tell him straight up that you're not going. That's so disrespectful.|`|081168f28573ebfa7f89cf91f00a1e36aa	Oh!!!! I would be pissed too!! This is what you do.<br>  <br>  1. Don't call him again, let hii call you. (and he will)<br>  2. Act nice and like nothing even happened.<br>  3. When he tries to make it up to you (and he will want too), let him.<br>  4. When he set up a date say yes<br>  5. When he comes pick you up, don't be home!<br>  <br>  This will fix his azz!|`|V7IdZplIaa	He sounds like a psycho. leave a note on the front door saying your not home. and keep the doors locked and the lights off.|`|rY84Ap6Maa	What what, in the butt? your asking me? ooh your kidding. well, 2 free points for me.|`|xCifmFfkaa	dkjfkjd  babhahaha.|`|v2XKMN32aa	Wow what an inconsiderate jerk, I would let him know that you don't want to have anything to do with him anymore and just keep him out of your life you don't need someone like that around. Think about it would you ever do that to him? No. So what makes it okay for him... nothing. Simply tell him that and shut your door. DO NOT LET HIM IN!!! Don't bother getting revenge it's petty and childish it's best just to avoid having people like that around. Besides revenge won't fix anything. Keep your dignity and your integrity intact unlike him.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|kWjy7uzAaa	YOur fckin bonkers lady, you didn't have to hang out with the poor guy and sell your tickets, you could have told him no. Maybe the poor guy is stuck in traffic or nervous about picking out something nice to wear or something.|`|QhXL4Lilaa	Girl, have him pay for your tickets and you're wasted time by having him cater to you.. That was a bad move and I'm glad he's leaving, I'm mad just reading that, I can imagine that happening to me, I would be pissed and ready to murder him... But karma is a *********... <br>  <br>  Answer the door and tell him he owes you money, if he refuses to cater to you, kick his sorry *** out and tell him never to call or speak to you again...<br>  <br>  A friend will not do that, unless it was an emergency, and clearly he was bullshiting you from the start.

Maybe it will wake him up|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	he kind of sounds like a manwhore|`|NprrQEreaa	say DO U LIKE ME|`|T1beLIQqaa	Plain and simple-he loves your body,NOT you-give him half a chance and he will bed you and move on.From my own personal experience, I can not remain ONLY friends with women-if we are friends-I already find them PHYSICALLY attractive-does not mean I LOVE them-yes-given half the chance, I would bed them, but I am a little more mature than that.It would not take much to go beyond that.If the female friend initiated it-my little more mature would disappear in an instant. You already indicated he mentioned wanting to kiss(no mention of love) you before.Honestly, I have never seen an Jerry-Elaine relationship on Sienfeld that lasted more than a few weeks, before it went to, or back to, a more intimate level-yes, even on SienFeld this did happen..|`|w5Oedybqaa	He might be trying to get over someone else, and now regrets what he did.

Let him see you blow him off.  Seriously, act like nothing ever happened and don't treat him any differently than anyone else.  He'll hit on you again, but it will just be to see if he can get you to mess around with him again. It's a game for him and he does not have an interest in making you his girlfriend.  He is being a jerk.  I'm sorry because it sounds like you really like him, but there is nothing you can do to make him like you more.  You need to go out with someone else.  This guy is going to keep leading you on until you've gone to far.  Sleeping with him will not make him like you.  He will have conquered you.|`|c5COgNGaaa	you should just ask him how he feels about you. that's the only way to get a straight answer. no one else knows but him so yea.. but the whole kiss and leave thing is kinda weird. honestly, i wouldn't even waste my time with him.|`|7DHWmzmsaa	he's probably just hiding it from his friend that he likes u. <br>  i dont know how a guy thinks but thats what it sounds like.|`|vQpEkNJRaa	he sounds like he likes you but is a chickenshit when it comes to dating..like me!!!|`|fc6bFYHvaa	Sex him up.|`|5gYFBZgYaa	your friend wants to get laid bigtimeee!|`|5NYTZyclaa	if your going to dances and slow dancing it probaly means that your 12 and in middle school so why do you care? wow you madeout amazing. get off of here and go to slep its past your bedtime kido|`|LsbzHLu1aa	he probably does like you and he just has something to hide like maybe a GIRLFRIEND and sometimes guys tell there friends things so they wont think they ar weird or sprung so they act like they dint like a girl when they really do|`|Q7axONxnaa	I think he is a jerk and if he didn;t like you he shouldn;t have done it in the first place.

Guys are so unpredictible and stupid. You hate them but you love them. I really don't know what to say b/c I don't know his persanality; you could ask him and he could be a total *** about it or he might not. Guys are a bunch of BS, I've known lots of girls who would go out with a guy one day probably getting fucked up and then being dumped by them the next. Well sorry for my rambling. DX Shelb|`|V8dXNAGeaa	Maybe the guy who told you that your "friend" doesn't like you because he's jealous, or because he doesn't want you to get hurt, or because he doesn't want this guy taking advantage of you since you recently broke up with Mike.  Or maybe it's something else entirely.  To me, however, it sounds like this guy likes you.  If he held you close like that, even after the slow songs were over, that can mean one of two things:  he's trying to charm you into thinking he's someone he's not and is going to use you, or he really likes you.  Since he's your friend, you'll be able to tell better than any of the people responding to this story.  I think that you shouldn't always believe rumors you here, either.  That guy who you last talked about may be trying to protect you for some reason, and doesn't want you around your guy friend in that way.  So I advise you to take it slow:  what's the rush?  Wait for him to say something, but if it takes too long (i.e 10 months), just ask him.  In the mean time, see if he asks you out, or just do something fun together.  It sounds to me like you guys have a good relationship already.|`|btgxidCUaa	i would confront him.<br>  he sounds like one of those guys who knows how to play girls and he does it well for attention and his own benefits.|`|dtujIWZzaa	I think you should just talk to him and ask him yourself. Don't be asking his friends or other people's opinions on what they think he was trying to do. Just be straight out and ask him face-to-face, not through the phone. That's really the only way you'll know for sure.|`|uvj8kbD0aa	well first off at the ending of ur story say dat you guys didnt make out wen you admitted that in the beginnig of ur story you said you did.<br>  <br>  but thats not important.....i say dat dis guy is messed up in the head and a lil confused.( i dont say dat in any mean way at all.)and if he uses its only making it worse.(trust me i kno from experience, i can on a certain level relate to dat guy.) im jus gonna say that its really complicated and ur not going to be able to understand. if ya wanna have a chance at being wit dis dude then ur gonna have to play it cool wit 'em and just act lyk ur above all dat past drama, but still be nice....jus not so "inviting". if you do manage to maintain a relationship with this guy it wont be a dreamy one like in da disney films, and he might not show much affection, other than what he wants.(also emotional abuse.)
AfsoZm2Gaa	This may not sound like a serious answer, but as the man, I would try this:<br>  <br>  1.  Back off - take pressure off of her.<br>  2.  Take the time on his hands, and use it to work on his mastery of  <br>       oral sex (he is a virgin, and this is going to take time).  He should <br>       express no interest in reciprocation (see #1).<br>  3.  As she gets more comfortable, SLOWLY start using 1 finger to <br>      enter her WHILE going down on her.  Over time, one finger  <br>      becomes two. Ease into this...<br>      I should break in here by saying that his goal is bringing her to   <br>      orgasm every time.  Practice, practice, practice...<br>  4.  Get her talking about sex.  Remember that anything she says is  <br>       ok.  He should start with asking for feedback on his oral.  This <br>       way, that way, etc, and slowly break out into tangents from there.<br>  5.  If they drink alcohol, he should start introducing it AFTER he can <br>       bring her to orgasm.<br>  Wait for it, wait for it... she will ask for it.  Hard.<br>  By the way, it doesn't matter what the Doctor says.  It's always his fault.  Everybody knows that!<br>  **** SWEET MILDRED SENT ME TO HELP YOU***|`|oqLqPwsJaa	It sounds like she has some kind of phobia of having sex. Maybe she should see a shrink.

She should get counseling.|`|ltUzwXZEaa	I think that it is nice that they saved themselves for each other until after marriage.It is no strange that she i uncomfortable with the  sex act but he should just be patient with her and with for her to come around but in the mean time there are other ways that she  can satisfy her husband until she is able to make love to him,by them trying other things she just might get in the mood to try again.Good luck to them.
NB4h4jTyaa	You can't do anything about child support, so don't even try. Your step-mom gets no say in where you go to college. There is also no reason for you to have to stand up to your step-mom. Be polite in her home and respectful to her, but she is not your mother or father. <br>  <br>  Ignore their talk about each other as best you can. It's crappy that they're doing this in front of you.|`|tawgKlOpaa	Oh NO!<br>  Just keep your chin up and always remember that you are pretty and smart and you are worth it!<br>  Oh, and go look at a rainbow or a kitten!|`|SsfnitjXaa	Actually your step mother is correct.  Enroll in a 4 year university near your house if possible.  If not then enroll in the closest one, or one that is near a relative you may live with (just to save money).  But honestly if you all that poor you may qualify for grants that don't have to be paid back.  Just make sure that you work your head off and graduate in 4 years. <br>  <br>  May I also suggest you have a career in mind, if not your are just wasting your money, no matter where you go.<br>  <br>  Most step moms choose the cheapest way out.  This woman must really be looking out for your best interest.

She is going to ruin her life before it even really starts.|`|JV0i77uiaa	You should tell her all the consequences and trouble she would get.  She is too young.  Maybe his family should know about this.  Advice her how she would ruin her life.  She can wait 4 more year.  What is going on in our society?  You should advice her about all she would be loosing in life.|`|iyPxWNH3aa	You need to tell her parents, NOW.

If she isn't ready to be a mother then she really shouldn't be having sex.  Birth Control Pills take a month if not longer to even take effect.  Even then they should both be using protection.  If you are her friend you should advice her of this and try and convince her that she is making a big mistake.  She should enjoy being a kid.  If she doesn't listen to you, then tell her mother.  She may be upset with you for a little while, but she will thank you later.  If her 'boyfriend' of 5 days actually had any respect for her, he wouldn't be asking her to have sex.  How much can you really know about a person in 5 days.  She is too young for babies of her own which means she really shouldn't be having sex.  Be a good friend, convince her that this is a mistake.|`|FW8zYilEaa	Tell her parents. Just go up to her parents and share that she has a boyfriend and that you heard they are ready to have sex. Share all that you know and help them the best that you can. If they don't believe you then try and tell someone else or your parents and talk to her and tell her that she has so much to go through before this and she is too young.|`|FIWB7Dgtaa	you are a good friend. 12 is too young to be having sex-especially after 5 days!! shes probably excited because she thinks sex will bring them closer and it will make her a big girl -the reality is he is probably just going to use her for sex and not talk to her again making her feel used and gross. but theres really nothing you can do other than telling her how u feel|`|E4TQE4RVaa	Just tell her flat out no.  NO NO NO NO!  12 is way too young to be having sex, especially after a 5 day relationship.  Definitely try to talk her out of it.  She might get get kind of mad now, but I'm sure one day she'll thank you for stopping her.|`|8NBq70JPaa	You are a good friend to be concerned. Its awful that she is that young and about to take that risk. Obviously this guy doesn't care for her for anything else since he has dated her for a whole 5 days and can't really call that dating since he can't even drive her anywhere since he doesn't have a license. Who knows how many of his friends he is showing the pictures too.  The pill won't protect you from diseases. Guys can even have HPV and not know it and it can cause cervical cancer in her or worse warts. You really need to talk her out of this.|`|U7kJPlciaa	Oh my goodness 12 is waaay too young!!! you should tell her not too!!! how could she even think of having sex with him when<br>  1. they have only been together for 5days<br>  2. they're 12 and 13!!! (i mean goodness! way too young!)<br>  if she has sex now, she will regret it later....and my goodness she shouldn't be thinking about sex when your 12! i mean im 15 and i havent even thought of having sex!!! you have to be wise when it comes to relationships and sex...if not you could end up making a mistake....so convince her not to!|`|Vz7j7AOqaa	YES, you have to convince her not to! 5 days?! Omg she is rushing into this too fast.Tell her she needs to think about what she is doing.That sex at the age of 12 is wrong & that she will regret it in the future.To go on the pill you need your parents consent to take any kind of medication.Before you know it she will be pregnant & you guys maybe won't be friends anymore because your parents will think that she is an influence on you.<br>  <br>  If she thinks your an overprotective friend just tell her that you are trying to look out for her. If all else fails then you should tell her parents before anything serious happens.|`|QdcmctmJaa	some people are saying to tell her parents but seriously i wouldnt. her parents wouldnt ever trust her again with dating. and she might not forgive you for it. tell her shes too young. she might not like that but its worth a try. tell her to go live out her life BEFORE she gets knocked up. the night there supposed to have sex, ask her to come over your place for a girls night. it might take her mind off it.<br>  <br>  hope i could help(:|`|LY1k1xvLaa	Wow, it's as simple as saying "your to young." Which you completely are, your friend is way to young to even think about going on the pill for those reasons. You need to tell her just that if she does, she will get a bad reputation. Especially if she has been dating this guy for less then a week.|`|47058848ed26897ec86acfe7dbd15807aa	She is way too young to have sex. Tell her she should not have sex. Tell her that she should say no.  The guy probably said if you love me prove it by having sex. I had a friend's daughter who did it because her boyfriend  said that and she regrets it. The experience was not very pleasant. What if your friend  gets pregnant? Or  a sexually transmitted disease?|`|Ruw7mXj6aa	well first of all im glad you posted this you deserve like a ******* medal or something well you should tell her not to do this she only knows this dood for 5 days shes 12 you say this kids way older 14 im 14 myself i say he might just be using her so i would go on and tell her to drop the relation and if she declines on your words then thats her mistake one thing please dont make bad decisions like your friend|`|PBp3JAS2aa	no,no.no. tell her NO<br>  oh my goodness that's horrid.<br>  you have to tell her no.<br>  <br>  she will screw up her life and be a sex addict....shes too young.!<br>  try your best to convince her not too without hurting her feelings. seriously if her loved her or whatever he wouldnt pressure her into it!<br>  <br>  <br>  it is pressure. trust me she may seem excited but i bet shes also wayy scared.

That guy may seem all manly and wonderful but he's just a boy and will drop her like a hot potatoe. He just wants to get his rocks off and she will be the one to suffer. PLEASE let her know that she shouldn't have sex especially if she doesn't have protection and that she should at least speak to a school counsellor or her Dr before doing anything that she will regret for the rest of her life. My advise is to tell her she's making a huge mistake, whats the rush??|`|OLZYHo17aa	wait 4 years? that's probably enough.|`|izznp1uiaa	Okay, i wouldn't tell her parents, because if you were just in over your head and you thought you wanted to have sex, you wouldn't want some one to tell your mom and dad. <br>  <br>  listen, you need to tell her that she is going to ruin her life, and her parents WILL some how find out, she is not even a teenager yet, inform her of that, remind her that sometimes you need to make mistakes to learn from them, but losing your virginity is not a mistake you can fix. <br>  <br>  i really feel bad for your friend. Pray for her, i will, and i want you to remind her, that saving yourself for marriage is the best gift you can give to god. <br>  <br>  and only five days? this boy does not like her, he wants her body. <br>  and she is only 12. seriously. i'm sorry, but this is a problem, and if you don't stop it now, you'll wish you did in the future.|`|V09bBUbhaa	tell her she is going to get in a big mess if she gets pregnant|`|eID9BlG1aa	let me tell you your friends future if you dont help her. theres this girl named alice who goes to my church and got pregnant so many times that it should be in the world records book. she started having sex at 12 and do you think her boyfriend cared about her? or do you think he was just looking for another girl to "get with"? when she got pregnant, did he care? even though before it all happened he use to take her out, tell her he loved her and be her romantic romeo? no he didnt, he just wanted some and she was another dumb girl who gave it up. then when she got a new boyfriend, she cheated on him to sleep with her ex boyfriend's brother and ended up pregnant agian! her so called "friends" just let her destroy her life and "let her make her own mistakes" instead of protecting her from her near hellish and slutty future. now tell me, are those girls good friend? a friend is someone who loves you enough to yes, let you make your own mistakes, but not mistakes that are going to hurt them in the long run. My friend sharay is the best friend a girl could have. she is having sex but shes trying to stop, she doesnt want to be a tool. she loves me enough that when I ask her advice on sex instead of telling me to do this and that and let me do it, she tells me she doesnt want me to be like her she wants me to be better than her. she doesnt want me to have sex cuz she knows how much it can change me and shes my best friend and she loves me and would never let me make a mistake like that. THATS A TRUE FRIEND! what kind of a friend would you be if you let this girl do that? she might tell you something like "I dont care, its not your decision" or its her choice, but remember it IS her choice, the same choice that if things go wrong youll be the person who stood by and let it happen and itll be a guilt youll have to carry on yout shoulder for the rest of your life. Alice will never learn, shes one of those girls that if you try to tell her to stop doing something thats gonna hurt her, she wont listen. the best thing that you can do for her is to steal her cell phone and get in a room alone with her parents and tell them whats been going on and if they dont believe you, then you show them the prof. its may sound hard to do, you may be afriad that if you tell her parents then you might lose her. but imagine how much her life might change after that. she'll thank you later, she WILL be mad but its for her own good.<br>  <br>  be a good friend and dont let her end up like Alice, be like Sharay and dont let her make this mistake. if you really care for her, you wouldnt let this happen.
xxQwv1nSaa	LOL. I'm almost crying laughing right now because this is the situation I was in a couple months ago. The only difference is, I almost screwed up the chance to have a great friendship with that person by staring at them constantly xD. But seriously, just talk to him. You're crazy in love with him, but you need to become friends with him so you'll get to know him. And then, if you have the same love for him, then you tell him that YOU LIKE HIM, not that you love him, or are obsessed with him.|`|CYSUuFmVaa	puberty acting up, trust me freshman year around this time i felt the same way over a girl i barely knew, we got together, and it was utter DISASTER  there's just so much you don't know about  a person, and it can end up crushing you. truth be told after that one relationship i don't ever want to fall in love again|`|sxnt92moaa	Crush much?

GLKD89wnaa	Tell your ex she needs to get her fat *** off the coach and get a damp job.|`|aWgdX0pZaa	Well, your wife is RIGHT! You two should not make your son pay the price b/c of your f*ing ex wife. I think your ex wife has really GOOD hands and feet to go and find some job. She is being a B*tch. Don't let this affect your marriage and take her to court for harassing, she does not have a leg to stand on b/c she does not have a job.|`|UUrqECXIaa	Why isn't your 11 year old on your family insurance? Well, anyway, she has to have the surgery done- set up a payment plan to pay your half and be done with it. Let the ex worry about paying her half.|`|y21VcTjDaa	You have an obligation to your 11 year old daughter just like you do the 5 year old.  You can regret the relationship with your ex but to say you regret what produced your daughter is mean and cruel.  As for your wife, while I'm sure she is getting tired of carrying the load, she married you knowing you had responsibilities elsewhere which would normally include monthly support.  To be honest, no 5 year old needs a 1200 per month private school...it's nothing more than pretentious.  You need to weigh up your priorities as does your wife.  Check with the military to see if they can help in any way for your daughter's surgery.  No matter what you do, you cannot treat one child preferentially over the other...it would be so morally wrong...they are both your little girls.|`|u1uECuFNaa	You regret your daughter?<br>  That is sad.<br>  <br>  Go to court and get it worked out. You do not have a job, you cannot pay...but I am sure you should be getting something from the military, right?<br>  To me the private school is way too much. And that much money for a private school? That is almost my rent and I think that is too high!!<br>  Don't blame or punish your daughter for being born.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	well they should have you on some anti depressants and you should start feeling better. tell your ex to go talk to the courts and to stop harrassing you. ur wife works to be able to put ur kids thru the good school so let her do that. tell your ex to get a job and support ur kid as well as you did.

l0xnIquFaa	that is awful, but that same things happened to my family. <br>  heres my story then i will tell u wat we did and what you can do:<br>  ok so my cousins were having there first communion party. me little brother and my cousin meg had theres about 2 weeks apart. in my cousin invite it said to rsvp asap, so my dad called in and said that me, my brothers (3 of them) and my parents WOULD b attending, he even called back a second time to double check, you know incase they forgot. well my dad fam showed up at my brothers party and my uncle told me that i looked cute in w.e outfit i had on, and said that my cousin meg had an outfit like it for her party. my dad just mentioned the party bc he asked like 'what time should we get there' and my uncle said that he didnt make reservations for 'my' family so we couldnt attend! my dad actually cried that night (i have only seen him cry a couple of times, and those were only wen somthing happened to me or my sibs) then a few years later my cousin bob (megz bro) had his communion my we got invited this times me dad called my uncle and aunt, email them and even sent them a letter in the mail. my cousin bob has brain cancer so every minute with him is a big thing. so my dad wanted to b there really badly.  even after my dad said we would b there a TON of times, my dad called on the day of the party to tell them we would b about 30 mins. late bc we had to drive like 2 hours to the party. once again my uncle said we werent invited.<br>  now im having my 8th grade graduation at the end of the year, guess whose NOT invited?? hmmm, o ya my dads ENTIRE side of the family, and they ARNT allowed at my wedding somday either, they can burn in hell for all i care (my dads entire family did some terrible stuff the past few years and im done with them)<br>  <br>  basically after htis christmas we cut off all connections with them. if they dont love us then we dont love them.  you should ignore them for a while, or crash your neices wedding, i doubt your sister would throw a commotion at her daughters wedding. just make sure to get her a GREAT gift as for the futur. it depends how much you care for them. i would keep inviting them to parties and stuff but if you are really upset i would cut off all connections. that is terrible that she did that to your family, and you shouldnt have to put up with it.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	well, if she didn't invite you then I wouldn't expect her to invite the rest of your family either.<br>  <br>  The way you deal with it is ignore it and don't invite her to events that you know she wouldn't invite you to or figure out what her problem is and try to heal the relationship.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	That is unfortunate.  Maybe your niece has been influenced by her mother or your sister is controlling things with this wedding.  Maybe you could bypass your sister completely and contact your niece directly to wish her well for the wedding somehow (by calling, wedding present and/or card etc).  At least she will know that you do care and don't want to impact on her big day by stirring up another fight with her mother and reacting to your non-invitation.   If you live nearby, maybe you can contact your neice after the wedding and catch up with her and the new husband then.  Good luck.|`|1NIFJaThaa	Oh dear, this is really awful. It doesn't really matter at this point why she hates your wife and child but what matters is how to resolve the issue, if it can be resolved at all.<br>  <br>  Every family has a family member to play the right ***** and to cause upsets. The best thing one can do is to avoid her if resolving the issue fails. Its sad but what can you do. Your loyalty is to your wife and family now and you can't afford for them to be disrespected even if it means being struck of the Christmas list.|`|AA11866897	Well, there's the basic answer of letting it alone and let your sister live her life with her family while you do the same with yours.  Or you could try to discuss it with her, explaining that her not inviting you or your family hurt you deeply and try to get a dialogue going.<br>  <br>  It really depends on why she feels the way she does.|`|fOHn1ISdaa	Well first thing is...why she hate you guys? So you guys can understand why she is not inviteing you. But if your sister don't wanna invite you. Then who cares. F Them.  <br>  But still.... try talk with your sister. Tell her how you feel, and make peace with her. ...What ever you guys did or she did ...or if you don't know the reason, why she hates you. Then of course talk to her!! .... If talking does not help. Then just leave her alone, and give it some time.

lPFUfbAyaa	Do you really have to ask that question? I think you know the answer.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	There are many clues that he is giving off that should have warned or told you he is only using you for sex.  Lets start with the fact that you have not heard from him in about a month.  Even if he was in rehab he would have called to either let you know how he was doing or find out how you were doing.  The fact that he did not even call you on valentines day, which should tell you that he does not even see you as a friend.  Then when he finally sends you a message all he ask you is do you want to have sex.  Then he did not come on your terms but on his and you let him.  When he arrived he got right to the reason why he came over in the first place.  Then when he was done he was ready to leave saying he had to get up early in the morning.  Remember you have not seen him in a month, if he cared anything for you, he would have talked to you about the things that had been going on with him or why you are so upset.  No matter how early he has to get up he would have spent a little time with you if you were more than a booty call.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	isnt it amazing that all the ladies say hes using you... its all his fault.  your the victim,,   bullshit,,,    get a life and live by morals that are good for you.... you started the process by droping your panties and inviting him into your bed,,, grow up and take responceability of your actions,,,,  stay away from the scum before you become scum,,|`|KOjVWXOCaa	Sorry to tell you, you are being used big time. Men take advantage of women all the time, so don't give up the goodies if you are not in a serious relationship or married. Its dangerous out there, you never know what std people have, because sometimes men don't have any symptoms. Use protection at all times, if you choose to have several different partners.|`|fIXuFk6daa	It sounds like you might have been used for sex. If a guy is that carless with your emotions and responds asking for sex... then I would say yes. Especially if he had sex with you and finished quick and then left... he did not even try to return the favor it sounds like... he used you as a pocket pu$$y|`|t1EyGUj7aa	I have to ask you: How long have you been knowing this guy? It sounds to me like he has another girl, and for some reason he wants to keep you around. His girlfriend must be on her period and that's why he comes to you. Yes he is using you for sex. You as a woman need to LOVE your self before you can allow others to love you. You need to NOT talk to him at all from now on. Guys come and go, DONT search for LOVE let it find you. It sounds like this guy really swept you off your feet or else you wouldn't be asking for help. You would of left him alone the first week he didn't answered your calls, or at least I would have. DUMP HIM >>>STOP HURTING YOUR SELF. STOP allowing him to bring you all this confusion.|`|3RW0uJfAaa	Are you serious? YES he used you for sex.. all you are to him now is a booty call. Dumb him and dont talk to him anymore! Find a better guy who will care about when youre upset. Youre worth more than sex!|`|ek7Ha2sjaa	So, i stopped reading at "So I havent seen this guy in 1 mo he was in rehab" drop the guy find a good one|`|xx8kSXiFaa	Used No...You Called On Him...You Asked For It And You Got It...Now Learn From That Mistake...Friendship Before Sex!!!|`|0k2QYM0eaa	First off you are not the only one to ever get involved with an addict. Rehab is designed to change people so they stop using. Personally I think he may have been reaching out to you for support. He might have really been in rehab. But he should have stayed with you after having sex. Give him a chance to prove if he loves you or not. But if the only time he comes over is to have sex, then you are being used, Ask to go to his place. If he won't let you he is hiding something, like maybe a girlfriend. If he is telling you the truth about rehab, you have to be prepared for a long road ahead. People who have addictions are very needy and it takes a lot out of a person to deal with them.
vatQCxfZaa	I would definitely keep it in the back of your mind that maybe he's changed his mind, but I wouldn't give up right away or turn into the crazy wannabe-girlfriend. It's hard to tell sometimes what's going on in someone's head. The possibilities are endless, really. Maybe he found something that he doesn't like about you, or found someone else he likes better; maybe he is just playing the good Christian boy card and he IS a player, he could also want some space. Or maybe...he doesn't realize that he's changed, or he wants to be alone to think about asking you out soon. He could just be distracted with other things such as family, school, church, etc. Break ups suck, and it often takes a long time to get over that person, even if they treated you like garbage. I think his decision to wait a while is very wise, that way you can be sure that you're not just a "rebound" girl. <br>  <br>  If you continue to feel as if something is off with his behavior, I think it would be reasonable to ask him. Not in an accusing way, "Hey, what's the deal?" but in a way that lets him know you care such as saying, "(name), I don't mean to sound clingy, but you seem very distant recently, is everything alright?" If he tells you something you don't want to hear, don't start flipping out on him, stay calm so that he knows he can be honest with you. It's possible that whatever it is is personal, and he may not tell you. If he says nothing is bothering him, just drop it with something like "Okay, good!" and give him a hug to, again, let him know you care. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped...|`|gayDcP57aa	I would say that maybe he has decided that he doesnt like you like he thought he did and doesnt want to tell you because he is afraid of hurting your feelings or maybe he is checking what else is out there just because he wasnt a player before doent mean he cant become one you could just come out and ask him whats going on if he wants more with you or does he just want to be friends

I would tell you to forget about him, but I KNOW thats easier said than done.  I think what works for me is to get really into work, and try to go out as often as possible.

You did give me some hints that I should have picked up on like when you would often smile at me, play with your hair whenever I was around, laugh at all my jokes (even the ones that were not funny), the way you would just happen to be at the store the same time I was each Friday afternoon, the way you would sit outside my house all night in your car so you could see me when I went out to get the paper each morning, and how you sent me all those flowers, cards, gifts, etc.  I know those were just your little way of saying it, but I just though you wanted to be friends.<br>  <br>  But now that I see it here on Yahoo Answers, I know that you want something more than friends.  I don't know what to say... I never expected it.|`|cRXT54jAaa	Yes,<br>  Yes I Do|`|UHfA9yHPaa	Ha, I wish someone would love me.|`|8VaTqkMvaa	haha|`|rXQAbazWaa	no, but i do now !<br>  love you too ! :)
raffyRYmaa	Okay it sounds like your girlfriend has went through a lot of hard things, so i would just be totally onest is a NICE way and say "I love you so much but i think you should get help for your wetting the bed problem, dont be embarassed about it because alot of people do it"  If i was her i wouldnt be embarassed so i'm pretty sure she wont be eighter. I also might no why she wets the bed, When your in the hospital and you go through a operation that you cant get up from you would have a small tube go in you so you can pee, and when she was in the hospital she must have gotten used to not having to get up to pee so it kinda is a habit to do it. all she really needs is these things you can get when you wet the bed there kinda like dipers but for adults or she can go to a counserler and get help. It's not a big problem but it could be when you have to clean your sheets all the time and have to sleep with someone who wets the bed. Just be kind and nice to her and she'll completly understand :)            Good luck                                                                                       PS :gett back to me if what i said helped you and her :D    <br>  <br>  ---Nikole|`|fMWmXD2faa	one word: Support
EKj4PH76aa	with the whole jealousy thing, i don't know how to <br>  help there.sorry.<br>  hint around at my feelings without coming right out and saying it,<br>  well you can smile at him, get closer to him without him knowing<br>  that you are.start telling him how good he looks on what he's<br>  wearing that day.
QCi8DGyMaa	just be really sweet and compliment her. just dont use lines. and i know that might not seem like much but trust me, it is to us girls.|`|urQnRQ4jaa	have a one on one date or have a group date and pull her aside and talk to her in private girls like that kinda stuff...hope that helps...|`|8e27XX4Raa	Don't do it man.  Enjoy the friendship please.  You can't turn back once you tell her that and it will change the dynamic and you will feel depressed if she turns you down.|`|m9ZQeKBHaa	You should try to hang out with her a lot I agree. <br>  I know that my boyfriend loves me just by the little things that he does. <br>  He will give me a little compliment out of the blue, he'll share something with me, he will send me a funny e-mail, get me a little treat.<br>  Little things like that let a girl know that she's loved.|`|271e6581641939afd4192f67ff3b66d8aa	Start asking her to do stuff.  I don't know how old you are, but even if it's a bunch of you going, see if she wants to go with you.  She'll get clued in that you like spending time with her.  Make a point to talk to her and joke around.|`|f34f90B9aa	Be very nice to herr and if you go somewhere for example the mall, buy her a smoothie or something. Or for a movie, buy her popcorn. Get what im saying?|`|nLAfzeitaa	well you tell her and say "look i really like you and if you dont like me that is ok but i will still have feelings for you"
aztQDdMXaa	What I would do is say, "hi mom, how are you doing? Your still not mad at what happened a week ago right? I don't hold grudges, and I got over it." But in front of your siblings, and if she does not answer back, then your family will see how selfish she is being. And do the same with her, make it seem as tho college is being a lot of fun, and don't get her involved, she will eventually give in and ask how everything is going. <br>  I have been there before, and it was with my dad, so it was harder than being in drama with a grown woman.<br>  =>_<=<br>  Hope it helped and I hope there is no more drama for you.|`|CTVkz71aaa	write your thoughts and feelings down and give the letter to your mother with a kiss on the cheek and an " i love you, mom ". then give her the privacy to read it. a verbal apology didn't cut it so maybe a written one is what's needed.|`|PNgXyElyaa	Me and my mom have always been tight! When we got in a huge fight like this we say down thoguht about the things we had in common then we went to go do thoughs things then we apoligized and got along.|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	u apologized....let time heal the rest. it will get better.<br>  <br>  you could also print off this question u typed, and leave it laying around for her to see....|`|wHrOKQrXaa	it is time for you to grow up and not be a victim in your family. i say this from my own experience. as a mom a daughter and sister and aunt. There is nothing worse than having broken dreams in a family when you love them so. When i visit one i always get a hotel room because i don't want to wear out my welcome. I will not take a chance of conflict because the relationship is what is more important to me. they are me and i am they. we are family. watch the movie Madea goes to jail it says it alot better then i can. take your mom and take your mind off  of your problems there is a good message in there for all. and unfortunately we mothers put ourselves into the martyr roll because we are use to it. and it makes us week because we make ourselves victims and hero's at the same time. but it is still whining.|`|ozbaqOyoaa	just step back and think about the fight, is there anyway you may have hurt her in a different way than you ever have before? if so apologizefor exactly that. just give it a couple days and if it continues then let her come to you!! i have these fights with my mom all the time.. and all it takes is time. your her daughter, she cant stay mad at you forever!! best of luck!!<br>  ~Elizabeth~|`|WlbgTO5paa	set them ( your family) down over a meeting and tell them what is on your mind. If they get mad at you take it calmly and don't get upset. Tell them that you are sorry again and basically present your side of the case without upsetting them.|`|QCi8DGyMaa	shes probably just angry/upset. maybe apologize to her one last time and leave her alone. im sure she will come aound.|`|5y5h5VYIaa	Let her be pissed. And if she says your not talking to her then make it that way.|`|L1EnPN67aa	That really sucks, I havre issues with my parents too, but it's with my father. I htink you should go to her directly and ask her why she is still holding on to the past. Maybe you said something really hurtful this time. Or go ask your dad to ask for you. Or ask your siblings, just find out what it is. And try to stop arguing with your parents. <br>  <br>  When you get enough money, and please work on it, MOVE OUT as fast as you can. Leave on good terms with your family and you wont have that drama and you can always go to them for financial help if you need.<br>  <br>  <br>  I say move out, because after awhile it just gets annoying to have to argue with your family and have to go make up, and sometimes parents (like my dad) are what you call old school and if you say certain things that we feel are normal for adults, but seemingly disrespectful to them they will feel...disrespected. And if you don't want to change your ways, MOVE OUT.<br>  <br>  You have the right to be yourself and be happy without always having to kiss your parents you know what. Just be civil and adiult and leave on good terms. They'll have no choice but to respect you.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	go to her privately and talk communication is the best thing every before its too late.
djUMvICoaa	If you still want her as a friend, how would you bring it up?  But I agree with you and the best thing might have been if you could have asked at the time how could you?  But how does anybody call stepping out of their marriage even a one night stand healthy for their relationship, you are now basing it on lies?  If she brings the subject up again tell her if it doesn't forget it.  You are already seeing her in a different light and probably be looking at her differently for a while until you feel she meant what she said.|`|Cpwedckvaa	You should tell her how you feel  One of my best friends has cheated on her husband...more than once...sadly...and I told her exactly what I think of her and her behavior...it was bad for her but this way we both have said what we need to say|`|aErUKUvVaa	Talk to someone else not involved with the 2 of u about it.  Ur only gonna make it worse and if u want her as a friend, don't go there.  She made her bed, she has to lay in it.  Not u.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	mind your own business nosey.|`|3bef6db1e814bbf22fd78ed76d048272aa	You should tell her.  If she told you, it seams like she wants to talk about it.  I think if you bring it up just like you did on here. like i" don't wanna judge but i'm upset".  But also be prepared to deal with her being mad for a few days or longer.  Good Luck!|`|Hg0es2S6aa	If i were you I WOULD TELL HER HUSBAND. <br>  ONCE A CHEATER ALLWAYS A CHEATER|`|ZW1xklaAaa	if she told you about the affair then you can say something if you just randomly found out about it its not your place|`|JH6oCuUZaa	Tell her how you feel, she needs to know she has lost respect because of how she treats people
FNi40XSaaa	Well to the person who answered before me, she already got him a nice watch for his birthday.<br>  <br>  And unless he is really into theatre or feminine entertainment, I don't think he'd appreciate the opera, iceskating, broadway or anything of the like... honestly, just ask him what he wants. Guys are very good with direct questions and answers. If he says nothing, then pay attention to his hobbies and interests. If he likes sports, get him some sports memorabelia, like a jersey, a hat or a bobble head. If he likes movies, look for one he likes and doesn't have. Take a look at his movie collection, is there a trend? Lots of action? Sci-fi? For our first anniversary, I got my boyfriend a book written by his favourite author, KungFu Panda the movie (which he loved), and a set of candles in sandstone candleholders that had a love poem engraved in them. So there was a little bit of fun mixed with a little bit of romance.|`|DT4PHmukaa	Think about what he likes. Maybe you can get tickets or reseravations or something nice so you can spend time together on your anniversay. Granted cheaper tickets are in nosebleed sections but it's an idea.<br>  Opera <br>  Ballet<br>  Ice Skating Event<br>  Concert<br>  Dinner-your treat<br>  Movie theater<br>  sporting event<br>  picnic in the park <br>  rent a movie from netflicks or video store<br>  maybe you can cook him dinner and just have a romantic evening together|`|og6bVSlUaa	guys dont need expensive things a womans touch usually suffices make him dinner or make something that he can keep one of his cherished keepsakes in. Even guys know sentimentality and how much it means|`|196xhUgjaa	get him a watch he would like it and it would last a real long time|`|6QmvMyOAaa	cologne. what goes around comes around. :) <br>  try Tommy Bahama cologne with some Tommy Bahama rum. that's what i got my boyfriend. now we r engaged. :)  also i got him a Tommy Bahama dress-shirt. good luck!!!!|`|4fC6EJWfaa	guys don't typically wear rings unless they're married, get him a leather string necklace with a pewter pendant of some kind.|`|1YcKHGLqaa	You could get him a promise/eternity ring, but put it on a chain, so he can wear it under his clothes :) It's what I did for my boy and he only takes it off to shower.
abTZX46faa	yupdidoodlieno|`|Oz0h1TXwaa	You'd have a better chance of getting<br>  hit by a flying mongoose.<br>  JK! She likes you.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	yes you do she is just be grounded and you have to respect that.|`|4d7f164df9b799e88fffba204ae0183faa	Ya she likes you.  If you saw her two nights in a row and then she has been texting you she does.  Maybe she really did get grounded.  It could be an excuse but probably not if she sounded depressed and started crying.  She'd have to be a really good actress to pull that off.|`|CX5RGqZuaa	if she was that depressed about not going to the movies with you than she definitely like you.|`|5VQrGtIIaa	Sorry, she is sitting in my car right now.|`|XTSiJBv4aa	she is not grounded! she is out with someone else right now. she does not like you and would have crawled out of her window to meet you if she was grounded and really wanted to see you. don't let her play you like that. find someone else, you are only 17, live your life a little!|`|GaHXxlS7aa	I think that your overreacting. Just calm down and everything will be okay. She's grounded, that's why she couldn't go to the movies with you. She hung out with you 2 nights in a row, she's interested. Just be patient. Don't rush the relationship if you really care about it.|`|PB9EklObaa	Dude it sounds to me like you're in like Flynn She has got to be into you about the club I don't know but keep doing what Your doing she feels comfortable with you from what I am sensing good luck Dude. oh yeah remember this everything happens for a reason.|`|271e6581641939afd4192f67ff3b66d8aa	That's enough to make you feel uncomfortable...you text her something like that and she doesn't respond right away.  I bet she just got tied up or  her parents walked in or something.  Ask her about it, but be light about it, sarcastic or witty or something "so what's with me telling you blah, blah, blah..."|`|ke1SgRxTaa	probably either that shes into you or she just wants to be good friends, but since she seemed really upset that she couldn't go probly into u, BUT since she didn't txt bak after u said that ... she might b freaked out... like in a good way...  or bad it could go either way <--->|`|CdZK7XjOaa	Yup sounds like she really likes you. She probably just got grounded and didn't lie cause she sounds nice so i think she probably likes you if she always hangs out with you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UfmxdEFkaa	ahhhhh coca tea....good times, good times.|`|7ff93384150a84022f12b48eda390e79aa	You should try again with more watchmen.|`|xxQwv1nSaa	You're being a bit paranoid. If she got grounded, then that's just it, and she probably DID go to sleep. When people get sad, they tend to become sleepy, so she does like you. But it's not a good idea to try to sneak into the club. If you cared about her, you wouldn't want to risk her getting in to any trouble.|`|ek7Ha2sjaa	come on, seriously? dont be insecure....be confident and tell ur self...i WILL take her to pleasure town

B6EVKaFPaa	Have you looked at working at home?  I think that the home party plan companies provide the best of both worlds.  As a Scentsy consultant, I choose when I want to work and how much.  I also can do home parties if I choose and when I do, it's a nice chance to have some "me" time and time to interact with adults.<br>  <br>  Just something to think about.  There are a lot of different companies out there to choose from.  Decide what you can be passionate about and go from there.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!<br>  <br>  Lisa|`|8ilHQMq5aa	i think that if you can afford to stay at home while the kids are little then that is great. if not find a reliable babysitter. i work in a home day care and think it is better for kids than a regular day care, it has a more homey feeling... but i also think that when all the kids are in school you can go to work and you could do mother's hours if you want to be home when the kids come home. as the daughter of a stay at home mother i have to say i am lucky that my mom was home for me when i got home from school. she didnt start working full time until i was in highschool and my siblings were in middle school.
wHrOKQrXaa	i am a working mom second time around i worked for 22 years at the same job . work is slow ..but ... i am raising grandchildren. and they are beginning middle school.and this is where my children were having problems. i do not want to make th same mistake i had made before. So as you i am looking at quiting. because of government cut backs ,this seams to be a workable solution of me doing my part to give back to my community. keep my grandchildren out of trouble|`|Vc6eNci9aa	I work as a Survey Schedule Coordinator at AAAHC. And before I was a stay home mom for 14 yrs. I then worked as a Licensed Practical Nurse. But I like being a stay-at-home mom more.|`|c33f9c2b4f3efbf28fdc82af3fd5c309aa	I am a SAHM.  My husband and I planned this before having children. We had to go down to one car, cancel the cable and let go of many luxuries. We also planned our children (weird, in this day in age).  I love being a SAHM.  It is the hardest and easiest job at the same time.  We lay in bed all morning reading books and cuddling.  I love it!  I was a teacher before hand so I really use my time wisely to teach my children.  At night I go to school to get my masters in education.  I plan on going to work when my youngest goes to kindergarten.  This is the greatest time to further my education so I can have a good pay increase when I go back to work.  I am so thankful for the opportunity to be with my children all day.  I have many friends that work full time with kids and respect that decision as well.  With the economy how it is I think people are less judgmental of working moms.  It is really a shame how many moms judge one another when we should support each other.  People always act like I have the easiest life but it really is hard not being able to buy many things.  I cannot wait to go back to work and be able to go out to eat :)
3y0w1qIBaa	I am no girl expert, but if she talks to everyone and being herself, but you, then that means that she likes you.  The best thing for now is to treat her the same and hopefully it will increase her confidence and more open minded to you.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	She is shy and she may like you so she is nervous.

0234a5919425f2503a2245af18fde971aa	Go there. Of course. Four hours is as far away as you want it to be. Will you feel home sick? Of course you will, all freshman do when they go away, but it will be incredibly good for you in ways you probably wouldn't really appreciate right now.  You will be in control of your life like never before...but still be very close to home actually. You family will be able to come see you as often as they want because four hours in a car in not very far. And you will be able to come home as often as you want to...but I would recommend once a month or so because you will make a number of friends.  Since they too will be away from home, you bond quickly. Go for the gold. It isn't as though you are not gong back home ever. Do it! Go for it! Call home daily, email, send pics, you can easily stay in contact these days. You worries are normal, but take heart in the fact that what you are feeling literally millions of people have been in your situation before. By the way, a certain percentage go back home after on semester, and the ones I know always say that they regret not sticking it out.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Of course you should go sweetie.  I know it will be hard, but it's close enough to family that it will be easy to come home for visits.  You can handle anything you put your mind to.  Reach for the stars and don't look back. Good luck!!!|`|nPt7hUE8aa	Um..... that's easy. Go. <br>  <br>  4 hours isn't far. You need to learn some independence. So go.|`|51dc9a048ec5f1dbc3da4596a39dec77aa	I say you should do it.|`|gwG2X8bGaa	You should definitely go. Life is short and you really don't want to have to regret anything. You should live your life how you want and especially when it comes to YOUR education. Do what you want to do because in the end you will be happy you made that decision and four hours is not that far from your family, and I think it would be good to have a little space and when you come home every other weekend or what not you will be MORE excited to see your parents.|`|p68Y7pxIaa	Yeah!<br>  Go for it. If you have really done your research..then you should. Don't worry about home..It's not like your leaving permanently. There are students out there who are willing to go college thats 5 or 6 hours away.You also get a place to stay, I'm sure college can offer you one!<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  sunkist;)|`|BSrucfDBaa	yes you should go it will help you be more of a family person and cause you will be able to handle your own situations and be more responsible of your business.|`|spbuQvLiaa	Go for it you can handle it and your family will miss you but they will also be so proud of you!  Good Luck!|`|B3v8cLESaa	I say take a chance and go for it. 4 hours really isn't that far away from your family, and you'd probably regret not going.|`|WlbgTO5paa	if you go 4 hours away then you will most likely see your family every other weekend so if you can handle then then go for it, but if you cant then don't|`|V0uUiAGOaa	You should decide what is good for you and not worry about your ex. He should not be a factor in your life anymore.|`|QkIJEG1Gaa	I think 4 days away from home is better... just my 2 cents|`|Kdr9CRbqaa	o gosh that's a tough decision... i go to a near college b/c of the same reason, but u shold think to urself, what do i want most? besides u can always cam chat with ur family in college.|`|H7ENkTxaaa	Well you gave four good reasons for going there: cheap, <br>  relatively close to home, good teaching program, and far away<br>  from your ex.  So I say GO.
K6TeDfEZaa	Well, this is really a simple err.. okay, it's not a simple answer.<br>  A best friend is someone we come to appreciate more than any other person. As you get to know people better, you may change your mind and disrupt the friendship.<br>  <br>  Usually you get to know yourself better, and they get to know themselves better, and the friendship moves on and you split or become closer.<br>  <br>  You must respect the friend as much as yourself. Never forget that is the key to TRUE friendship.|`|7LS5HmFjaa	At different times in our lives we come across people who will be there in our life for only a season others for a lifetime. Unfortunately sometimes we mix up the two. In any relationship, there should be trust, honesty among other attributes. However, with time, people will either remain the same or change and not always for the better. This in turn causes conflict within relationships. Circumstances will also play a big part in any relationship. This may lead to betrayal, deep hurt and great mistrust. Friends who truly want to remain friends must overcome these and any obstacles. It does take commitment however if its not worth saving its just easier to walk away...|`|O5KwzStkaa	Well as a person who has lost a best friend sometimes it's completely out of your hands. It maybe that for some reason something happened and neither of you can overcome it. Or maybe a comment that was completely taken out of context. It might be that you chose someone to be best friends with that you knew wasn't a nice person because you needed someone. Or you thought you could help them, change them. And also have you never had a fight with one of your friends? Ever?|`|FW8zYilEaa	Because people grow and mature. Some don't and i don't want to sit around for stuck up brats that are immature and i don't recognize the friends they used to be.|`|f5cf5ncYaa	R U KIDDING ME?! it's life! more likely than not, ur not gonna be best friends anymore! Right now I have the bestest friend I could imagine, but first it was her, then this other girl, then this other girl. N now it's her again. :D
8IyZphFVaa	are you sure you aren't being paranoid? don't pay attention to them. just focus on the teacher and then leave when it's done.|`|ddc7688c9403e9b2641228799e0da4b0aa	lol just suck it up for one class..<br>  its not that big of a deal
7LS5HmFjaa	Its important here to not just focus on "Blanche." The reality is that he could be the one who is also being deceitful. We cannot know with full certainty that he truly is separated from his wife when they are still cohabitating. A man who has made up his mind does not need to 'think about it.' His intentions must be questioned as well as why is he still living with his family...is it a matter of economic convenience? If so, how will he be able to live and support himself and "Blanche?" In all fairness, should both parties genuinely wish to continue this relationship, everything should be brought to the table. Irregardless of age there needs to be honesty so this needs to be the starting point. If your friend truly would consider such extreme action, perhaps you could suggest counseling for her. It seems she has low self-esteem as to she is not accepting of herself for who she is. As well as the fact that she is basing her whole future on someone who just may not be the one for her. You are a good friend to care so much for her. Help her to accept herself and be confident. This way she won't settle for less than what she deserves.|`|GkH5NoFyaa	This relationship is doomed from the beginning. He is cheating on his wife, and his kids, and she is lying to him about her age. Two people who are self-destructive. Stay out of this mess. They will only drag you down when the relationship ends. And it will end badly.
Aj2iJZXJaa	I'm sorry to hear that, people can be really annoying like that! I think that you should just ignore them or talk to them about how you feel and I wish you the best of luck! Hope I helped. ~I LOVE Derek|`|8waXhvPuaa	I don't know how to respond to that.|`|k4XLr4TUaa	I think maybe cause they really like you.. Like they thing your a cool person and they want you to feel happy by asking you how's this and that, like they want you to feel the center of them. They may want to be your friend like BEST friend or something..|`|AA10939951	I think u did the right thing by telling them to mind their own buisness..ur not a light switch u cant switch u on and off whenever they want to be friends with you and know information..|`|hWUXnEpMaa	alll twins are annnoying.

c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Get counseling...and by the way...married men do not have girlfriends...|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	This situation would depend on how you want to handle your marriage.  Do you want to work on your marriage are be with the other woman.  Before something happens between you and the other woman you need to figure out what you want from your marriage.  Cheating on your spouse will not make things get any clearer than want they are.  If you feel that you want to be with this other woman you need to get out of your marriage.  The reason why you are more comfortable with this other woman is because she is new and you feel you are getting all the things you are missing at home.  Remember that the grass is not always greener on the other side.  You need to stop all communication with this other woman before something happens and you can not take it back.|`|73c08aa590c890d1f54b22d1db2cef60aa	You aren't doing the kids any favor by staying together. Have enough respect for each other to get a divorce and work out custody arrangements and all of that.|`|AA11156937	Is that how much marriage and your kids mean to you? Use your conscious.|`|4SXa9lJWaa	You have to care for your kids.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Get a divorce.|`|AvmKTcJNaa	You really shouldn't have been with another girl in the first place but it already happened sooo.... What is the question? Are you looking for someone to say you had a right to be cheating or do you want things to work out with your wife? <br>  <br>  This is a real big predicament. You see unless you fix things with your wife then how do you know it won't happen again with your new girlfriend? You need to find out why the relationship went sour and either fix it with your current partner or let your spouse (who you promised to spend the rest of your life with) know so you can move on. Either way find out why it went bad to begin with otherwise it will happen again and you'll be in the same place a few years from now. Whether you're with your girlfriend or still with your wife.<br>  <br>  Another thing. It's not your kids fault but unfortunately kids have a real talent for blaming themselves. You can't just abandon them. You can leave the relationship but you can't abandon the family. No child deserves that kind of pain. If you leave you should still be a part of there regular life while still in peace with there mother.<br>  <br>  Yes, I think it goes without saying that your wife will be unhappy. and even though things went sour, as a human being you don't want to hurt her, do you? I'm not there so I can't tell but even if it was partly her fault for the bad relationship, you're the one who strayed while she was trying to make things work (it may have not worked greatly but it was an effort you ignored). As hard as this will be for anyone you need to admit most of the fault. Because if you didn't have the new girl, things could have still be salvageable but now it's 5 times harder for her.|`|awLr3uCaaa	Counseling. This is going to be very difficult, either way. DO NOT under any circumstance, stay in a marriage in which you are not happy. Although I do not condone extra-marital affairs, it might have been a good thing that you discovered other things out there that can make you happy. My parents stayed together "for the sake of" me and my sister and it only caused more heartache in the end. My parents are not happily divorced. Get some counseling, tell you wife what's up, and live for you. That's all you can do dude. Good luck to you.|`|6b7UXPUQaa	Cheating is one of the most awful things anyone can do. I was cheated on and it was the worst thing anyone had ever done to me. I suggest being honest with your wife. Talk about it with her. If you don't want to get a divorce, then get some counseling. If you do want to get a divorce, I'm sure the two of you could figure out a way that would be best for the children to cope. If you do end up getting a divorce, be honest with the kids and make sure they know that it's not their fault and that you both love them with all of your hearts.<br>  <br>  I hope you figure out what's best for you and that all will go well.|`|uwCcIY8Aaa	yes. you're married.<br>  even if the marriage isn't that great, you should of realized that before you got married. this is exactly why you don't rush into marriage.<br>  there is always divorce, even though that's hard on everyone. even the kids. i guess talk to your wife about it and say, even though we're married maybe we should just date other people. just to see how things are.|`|QDVXC0GMaa	if ur wife puts up with u for the sake of the kids, why cant u????dont u care for ur kids? Dont make the lives of ur kids a lving hell.<br>  Stop the relationship with ur girlfriend and try to be a good father if not u will regret it later|`|fGtIMyMXaa	You are straying. Stop the crap immediately. You are bringing ruins to your family. Your wife will be heartbroken.|`|94Ts9aLHaa	Ali lol|`|g6MiGWuJaa	why dont u try to put the attention you give to your gf to your wife and family|`|WniOOchkaa	I think you should decide what you want and pick one or the other.  If you keep going between both of them it will probably just cause more problems.  First you need to decide if you want to be with your wife, reguardless if you have the girlfriend or not and act on that.  If you decide not to be with your wife you should take care of that first and then decide after that is finished if you want to continue with this girlfriend.  If you want to stay with your wife then you should end things with the girlfriend.|`|5YdcrgGoaa	try to get a divorce. if that doesnt help just "seperate" but live together for the kids until they are old enough to realize and handle a divorce. also if you get divorced while your kids are young it will hurt more then if they were 13|`|2WEoZWmHaa	WELL FIRST DESCRIBE THE GRL THEN DESCIRBE THE GRL MORE AND THEN THINK ABOUT IT YERSELF CUZ IDK WHO IS THIS =GIRL=<br>  <br>  CLEARS THROAT heee|`|59f3fb5349cc37c5db705b9e5de40dd1aa	Wow....sounds like an episode of seinfeld.|`|ek7Ha2sjaa	first off, thats disgusting....having a gf while you're married....thats completely ridiculous...what should you do? leave both of them, cuz u dont deserve a women in ur life
15VxE4vdaa	I've only been married 6 mos, but I've already realized that a great deal of getting the most out of marriage has to do with steering the conversation towards compromise. no matter how little either of you want compromise, you will both be happier for the effort. I do agree that emotional security could improve with more time around one or two parents, but it definitely wouldn't suffer with both parents working.|`|euQFQzc5aa	You can't fight her on this. You may have married the wrong woman.|`|ZNPdphweaa	As long as you both aren't working constantly, the kids will be fine. As long as your kids can see both of you for advice, it will be fine. If she wants to work, support her in that choice.|`|spbuQvLiaa	Your wife should work.  Maybe you can stay home and watch your brain turn to mush.

Like telling your friend that you can't stand it when another friend does the same thing. That way you are telling her this is something that annoys you...but you don't have to hurt her feelings by telling her directly it's her. hopefully she will get the hint|`|K6TeDfEZaa	Try asking her about the things that you used to do together. See how she reacts to that. If that goes well, try suggesting some of those activities now. Try reminding her that she is not 'her boyfriend' and that she's more 'fun' when you two are doing things you both enjoy.<br>  If that fails, try being busy when she wants to talk. Either she'll eventually come around, or you lost nothing that wasn't there to begin with.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.<br>  It's easier to have a good friend than to be a good friend.|`|WitqRbfaaa	well if she has been talking about him shes probably trying to make you jeleous or thinks of you as a really close friend. so i would tell her to "stop talking about him no offense or anything but its kinda getting annoying" and if shes just trying to make you jeleous then she will be all "whatever" but if she thinks of you as a really a close friend then she should stop. :)|`|Likst1Mxaa	I would say "I'm not interested in your relationship.

qIVy4eloaa	maybe, just maybe he has a special feeling for you and he's shy to show it to many people. he is not ready yet for other people to know that he likes you because he doesnt know if you like him back. Also he doesnt want to feel embarassed or dosent want you to feel embarassed on whatever happen. he's just concerned about you. your lucky that there's someone who cares about your image. Maybe he wants to tell you something he just need timing. If you can, you better start the talk and ask him whats wrong. there's nothing wrong in asking and talking personally is the best way to solve problems. Plus you will have more trust to each other.|`|kbGOMwi7aa	maybe he is inexperienced  around people, like when in groups and that makes him selfconscious|`|6d08d4117b506d7d5e374a3b065bb49caa	not so much embarrased as shy maybe.|`|cfc833c644ef0a9fd9a271abde252f77aa	when someone doesnt look you in the eye it means they are hiding something.....whether it be that he likes you or that he doesnt find his face appealing. its easier to think your facial features arent being scrutinized as closely when your not looking directly into someone elses face.|`|51dc9a048ec5f1dbc3da4596a39dec77aa	It's possible that he has anxiety problem around people.

May have problems talking to girls in general.<br>  If he is over 20, he is a generally dishonest person because he fears rejection and is probably looking for distractions to change the topic.<br>  If he is over 30, he may have a criminal history and you should talk to (his) family members and friends to find out more. Seriously!<br>  <br>  Sounds like you like him and are hesitant to engage in a romantic relationship with him. You should probably discuss this with him in a 'subtle' way since it seems to be affecting your friendship.|`|XU9kfVmKaa	sadly your bf is either embarrassed or is just to immature to have a girlfriend like you, your best bet is to just break up with him. trust me you can do so much better then that.|`|jktbtoSDaa	he probably has a crush on you, but he's most likely shy about it, and doesn't feel he can be open with you unless its just you and him.|`|QlROytniaa	He is nervous and probably wants to keep ur two relationship private.|`|VSPrT7V8aa	maybe he's just shy to new people he meets and is more comfortable around you than he is around other people.|`|QDVXC0GMaa	too many people to look at?

He would have not gone to the other girls house, or stopped things from goin so far and thought about how it would hurt you, not how good it would feel for him right then and there.

He must have known that by going into detail with you about what he & that girl did was going to hurt you, so why the hell did he do it? Move on cos you deserve better & think about it if you stay with him will you ever be able to trust him again?<br>  <br>  I don't think he knows what the true meaning of love is cos he seems to only think with his dick!|`|PTyYSdxbaa	Dump him and don't give him the time of day, move on with your life. Figure out what you want in a man and how you want to be treated...write it down on paper and keep it so you don't forget. Then don't settle for anything less. You don't deserve to be treated like this sweetie. Seriously, this guy is a loser who doesn't know how to treat women and you will never change a guy- people don't change. Trust me it took me a looong time to realize it but it's true...good luck.

Even though the abuse is mild now, it could lead to a much worse situation that could cost you a LOT more pain physically & emotionally. <br>  <br>  Unless you started getting physical with him during the argument, he had NO right to push or shove you at all!

This WILL quickly escalate into something you can't get out of. Don't let him have anymore power over you. You don't need him. He could be feeling he has too much control over you.<br>  <br>  Don't try anything. Just leave him, as soon as possible.|`|hxdV0wa4aa	this will only get worse as your relationship lengthens. he knows that the more time goes by, the less likely youll be to leave him, and right now hes testing his boundries. get out while you can!!!!|`|urQnRQ4jaa	He will get more and more violence towards you and you could get seriously injeried next time...I would say get out of that relationship...|`|hAXDWhiVaa	hes an angry person. he may be easily provoked. let him know it's not okay. get away from him for a while to show him you're serious.|`|AA10220566	you must leave him. any guy that treats a girl like that has absolutely no class and has serious anger issues. if you dont leave your asking for trouble!|`|vkYpTds8aa	leave him it'll never stop if you live a long life you'll see that people never change so find a good person to be around and live the bad ones behind you|`|h0ZdSxQiaa	not sure, its all on you!! if it was me, i would never lay a finger on a woman no matter how angry i was even if she was the one who made me angry. i will always respect her!!!|`|PtSeJXnEaa	he ONLY done it twice.<br>  sweetie thats twice too many. dump the jerkoff. did you not learn anything from chris brown?|`|A7xNZcrvaa	That's an abusive relationship.<br>  Talk to someone you trust.<br>  <br>  Tell him its really hurting you (physically and mentally), the way you guys are fighting.  Tell him he needs to control his anger or your leaving because he is only making the situation worse by fighting you.  Tell him how much you like/love him and how you don't want to leave him but if that's going to be the only way to stop this abuse, then that's the way it might just have to be.|`|fbf7a0218ad796311e2571268fcb04d4aa	It's violence and abuse.  It's only going to get worse.  Get out.|`|PNrJS4OKaa	It's gonna escalate. You should leave him, even if you love him, why put up with abuse?|`|vQpEkNJRaa	you should really seek anger management for him and get out ot the relationship for your OWN health. hey may say that he won't do it again, but it's already happened twice. with all the stories of domestic violence out there and the horrors it causes, why would you put yourself through it?|`|kwhxWYx9aa	if you really love him wait and if he does this one more time report his ***** ***|`|ejvCttS6aa	You sound so sweet... but honestly, you need to leave him because he has serious anger issues that he can't control. First, he'll start shoving you, then he'll do worst things like hitting you because you took the hits instead of standing up for yourself and demanding respect from him. I'm not telling you to go "Tina Turner" on the dude... I just think you should leave him. Its gonna hurt... but, you know you deserve better.|`|PTlzTu8uaa	hmm|`|iJ1jfDbRaa	Please please please get out of that relationship and tell someone. Perfect example of the most recent abuse situation happened to Rihanna by the hands of her man Chris Brown.<br>  <br>  There is NO excuse and I can guarantee that if you 2 stay 2gether and have kids he'll hurt them too....That is never ever ok!<br>  <br>  I said a prayer for you|`|CeJrap6Uaa	This is very siresus he should never shove you out of anger.

He will end up hurting you worse if not killing you. Its not worth any love to be physically abused by someone you love and care about.|`|f34f90B9aa	im sorry. but if you plan to marry this idiot. Ill be at your grave.|`|WrWcMPMcaa	Hun ive been in that position and in the end u probably want to leave him. i stayed and payed for it and then finally broke it off. it took all for me to do it and he hurt me for breaing up with him but it was better than continuing the pain.|`|0Fd9nqyHaa	Well you say you love him but if you let him just push you around and hurt you then you love him more than you lve yourself. There are many other guys. I do not want you to get hrt by him again take these kind of things to your mom. She is there for you or tell your best friend.|`|wX9ybBqEaa	This is a proffesional answers :P<br>  <br>  Create a 'game' for him.<br>  First, what you have to do is, test his loves towards you.<br>  <br>  -> Tell him a fake storytelling that you're leaving him because you're bored with his attitude<br>  <br>  Secondly, test his reactions<br>  <br>  -> If he let you go by yourself, he probably don't love you.<br>  <br>  -> If he don't want to let you go, you'll have to ask him to do something to proves his loves towards you.<br>  <br>  If he fails in proving his loves towards you, he doesn't love you.You might want to giving him a second chance when he fails at the first one.But don't give him too many chances.Keep failing means he doesn't loves you.Instead, he just want to hit you again and again.You're already waited for him to change for a long time but he keep fails.So, simply the best answer is : LEAVE HIM<br>  <br>  Maybe he just being confuse or anything.I don't know~<br>  Life's what you make it, this is just a suggestions :)<br>  <br>  Good Luck~!|`|CYSUuFmVaa	remember Chris Brown? he will urn into him and shove you out of a car one day, dump him, you don't want to end up on tmz with a swollen face|`|Oz0h1TXwaa	Tell your parents.|`|hAz30eGVaa	call the police before he kills you!!!!<br>  <br>  you might love him, but he obviously doesnt love you.

If he says know then say if you ever do it again you'll leave him. If he ever does it again then leave him.|`|zTeW6BIIaa	sweetie, LISTEN TO YOURSELF! he's hurting you!! don't let him do that!! leave him before he really, really hurts you badly!!!!|`|g6MiGWuJaa	leave him you think its hard to leave a bf but its nothing compared to getting bad hurt,embarrassed, or marring him or getting preg by him and having to leave him then.. get out while your young and its early.  You will regret it if you dont and be happy if you do.  You dont deserve it and he wont change.  Dont lie to yourself be true and be safe.|`|NprrQEreaa	hmm...|`|9851deb6f5776ae6834cf0b79571e624aa	OMG|`|7oYpbSjIaa	lol.  you're so funny making up stories about your life.  is this the father to the baby you allegedly miscarried? or is this the fiance who has a sister in the hospital so you are breastfeeding her baby while managing your alleged type 1 diabetes?|`|9ko5WUFkaa	You need to leave him.  He has assaulted you, twice!  This is not good enough.  He needs a serious wake up call.  You need to break it off with him, call the police and get a restraining order and cut all contact with the a**hole.  This isn't love - it's about him trying to control you with violence.  If you stay with him, you are basically telling him it's OK for him to treat you this way and it will keep happening.  That's not a maybe, he will do it again and it will get worse.  He needs to know that what he has done is very, very wrong and if you get the police involved, not only will it scare the crap out of the coward, but it might make him get help before other women are abused by this jerk.<br>  <br>  What you seem to want is for us to make excuses for his behaviour, but there is none.  There is no good reason for his violent behaviour towards you.  I understand it won't be easy, but you have to get away from him.  Surely you have family and friends that love you and wil support you.  <br>  <br>  Please run away as fast as you can and never look back.  You deserve better than this.|`|2rUTU2csaa	Get out of this relationship now. <br>  <br>  There's a Lifetime movie called "No One Would Tell" .<br>  <br>  Anyway, you don't need to put up with that. It doesn't matter how much you love.|`|2F4vkfnxaa	thats called abuse my dearrrr.<br>  if i were you, i wouldn't take that.<br>  i know you love him,<br>  but love most defiantly is not violence.|`|mXZ4825aaa	Do you want to end up dead or like Rihanna with all those bruises on her face???? If your answer is no then break up with him. If your answer is yes then prepare to be killed.

fgbgPx0Taa	Don't push it - stop asking all the time.  You're trying to force him on them.  Seeing him every couple of weeks or so really isn't all that much.  Let them take their own time to come to realize that he is NOT like your previous boyfriend.  They will eventually accept him, tattoos and all, if he really is as great as you say.  Just live your life and let things progress naturally.    <br>  <br>  Think about this - when you first were with your previous boyfriend, you probably said nice things about him and it didn't turn out.  So let time prove that you have made a better selection this time.  And count your blessings - at least they aren't telling you you shouldn't be with him!|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Well, I think that is right, they are a bit cautious because of your history and you are their daughter that they would love very much.  Maybe your mom is also hinting it would be a good idea not to get tied down yet, rather than that they dislike him.  Earning their trust would take time and you can't force it for your boyfriend.  Your parents have not expressed negative views, which is a start.  Maybe give it some time and take a bit of notice about their possible views of take you time and let's get to know him better and not get in too deep too quickly.  Maybe you think more of your parents than to assume a few tattoos would write him off completely in their opinion (in other words, maybe they are a little more broad-minded than that).  Good luck.|`|8ilHQMq5aa	you may have nailed it. she is probably wary... she probably doesnt want to start to like him yet because of the last guy.....<br>  and funny thing about parents disliking tatoos.... my dad always said that he hated guys with tatoos...and the only acceptable reason to have one was to be a sailor... well my now husband was a sailor and has tatoos. and thinking about what my dad said makes me laugh. i have always loved tatoos on other people|`|ImnZzaRCaa	same has happened to me. Basically with my mom and dad--they calmed down and liked him more once they realized that he did stick around and showed he wasn't going to do what the last boyfriend did.<br>  <br>  I sugggest: Give it time, reassure to them how nice he is to you, and make sure that you bring him around even more.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|HzUM8hVSaa	i can understand you mother's worry and concern about this relationship, she just cares a lot about you.<br>  <br>  You could try and explain all the things he does to make you happy. Show her how much you care that she cares. Show her why you think this relationship is different.
0k2QYM0eaa	This is a very ugly situation. eventually this other woman will be asking for child support. The amount of money can range depending on which state you live in. Even if he is giving diapers and paying daycare, he will still have to pay child support. The courts do not care what extras he is doing. She is definitely trying to break you both up. You have a very long, ugly, miserable road ahead of you both. His little mistake is going to affect your lives for many years. I assume you have had a paternity test done. If the test was positive then he has to care for the child. As I'm sure you know, hookers are mental cases. Stay away from her as much as possible. He should thank you for being so understanding. This woman will keep messing with you until someone else wants her, or she dies. She will keep trying to break you two up until she hs another man in her life, But who wants a hooker for a life partner? The only thing you can do if he is sure the child is his is to try to prove her an unfit mother. This will give you custody of the baby. If she has been arrested for prostitution, drugs, or any other charges you have a chance of getting custody of the baby. Try to stay strong, stand by your man, and hope for the best. Sorry I couldn't give you an answer to your situation.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	Somewhere along the road this woman was given all of the power and control over your house as well as her own.  There needs to be a point where you and your boyfriend have to sit down and have an adult conversation and come up with a solution about this problem together so you can take back control of your house.  Since this baby is his and he is doing all he can to take care of the baby maybe he should go to court and get visitation rights of the child.  The other mother is using her child against your relationship and it is hurting the two of you.  Instead of getting mad at her, which is what she wants you have to be the bigger person and stop letting her get to you.  Sooner or later she will see that she is not making much of a dent in your plans or relationship and it will stop.  Maybe or maybe not, but you have to deal with her because your boyfriend has a baby with her.  You really do not have to deal with her on any other level except when it comes to the baby but she will try her best to string you in so you and your boyfriend are not getting along.  She should not be a topic in your household as much as she has been.  If you have plans to go out with just the two of you than keep your plans do not let her stop you from having plans.|`|5YdcrgGoaa	she is an immature beoch who needs to grow up.. your boyfriend needs to go to court and get custody of his child because that is whats right and hearing her background i think he will win full custody. sorry if i didnt help

tKinAaJiaa	omg they never said if they were a guy or not ya'll could be callin a girl that likes guys gay<br>  <br>  Here is my answer, just be yourself. Flirting isnt really something you just know how to do, its more of an instinct. When you are by a guy your interested in your flirt naturally|`|PBhnn2hqaa	You can let them know that you are interested by making eye contact.  Also, it lets you know if they have initial interest in you if they look back.<br>  <br>  Play the eye thing for a while until either you or him work up the nerve to talk to each other.  <br>  <br>  Once talking, laugh at his jokes and try to show him that you have a good since of humor (light sarcasm or wit works too).  <br>  <br>  Smile a lot and act like you generally have a happy disposition about life.  <br>  <br>  Once the flirting is about to come to an end make a comment about how you never realized how funny/insightful/cute they were and say "we should hang out sometime soon" , "you want me to call you?"  if he says yes say "then I'll need your number"<br>  <br>  The best advice is to do the things discreetly.  Just act natuaral and act like yourself as much as you can and people that won't be attracted to you for you acting like yourself are tools and not worth your time.|`|7DHWmzmsaa	ha. ur not pathetic.... flirting kinda comes naturally.<br>  honestly i didnt know how to flirt and one summer i was<br>  at a swim meet and i was just talking to and messin around (cleanly)<br>  with this one guy and everyone was running around saying i <br>  was flirting with him BIG time. lol.<br>  <br>  all u really have to do is talk to him, joke around, use small talk, play around with them... things like that. it'll come pretty naturally once u start. trust me.|`|azDAghihaa	You know, there are TONS of ways to flirt with a guy.<br>  <br>  The 3 key things you need to do are<br>  - TOUCH HIM<br>  - TEASE HIM<br>  - IGNORE HIM<br>  <br>  I am willing to explain these things ALOT more in depth, but it will easily be ignored on Y!A, so if you need MY help, add me on msn.<br>  <br>  darksonicnight at hotmail.com :)|`|tJg7TlnPaa	Make a long  eye contact with him as you bite your lower lip.

Be subtle, be attentive, do not be at all fake or shallow. He will know you mean business and you are not some flighty vapid thing.  never lower your standards to impress a guy. Be yourself.

There should be repeated contact. Eye contact is very important, it tells that you are sincere. On your first, he will make sure that it is really him that you are flirting with. With your second, he knows it's him and is all giddy about it and on your third, he might be going over to your table now, you should express interest by introducing yourself and starting a conversation. <br>  <br>  2. Whisper. This usually gets their attention. Avoid shouting. Check your voice; it may sound like a grill. <br>  <br>  3. Don't stay in a group. No man can bear a rejection in front of a herd. Also, he may feel that he can't approach you because of your friends. <br>  <br>  4. If you are not interested, be polite. You can always refer him to one of the girls. At least, you can practice your confidence in meeting other people and you just met a potential friend! <br>  <br>  5. Give clear signals that you are not just making fun out of it. Make sure to check your choice of words too, your flirting might sound a little sexual instead of a friendly flirting. <br>  <br>  6. Be positive. People like to be with people who are cheerful and has a positive mindset. Feel good about yourself and everyone, and they will feel good about you. <br>  <br>  7. Buddy system. This is used a lot by female groups going to parties or drinking place. Walk through a group of men and let one of your friends check out who is eyeing on you. <br>  <br>  8. Become more irresistible by showing a little of you, a little flesh in the legs is not that bad, wear something that can emphasize your great features. <br>  <br>  9. Give him the winning look. From head to toe, nod with approval and flash your sweetest smile. <br>  <br>  10. Lastly, don't forget to be YOURSELF! You will not enjoy any moment of it if you are playing somebody who you're not supposed to be, stay focus and be proud of who you are. <br>  <br>  Flirting is a negotiation process that takes place after there is some initial attraction. So, anybody can do it. These flirting tips for girls, teen girls and ladies in all walks of life is just some guide for you to go out and find that special someone, in case, you have your own style, just incorporate some of the tips here and I guarantee, you'll be I-R-R-E-S-I-S-T-I-B-L-E!|`|w5Oedybqaa	Good question! I don't know how to flirt with girls, so I'm kind of in the same boat. For one, some people are just more flirtatious than others, and that's just that. It can't really change. My advice is, just start out by talking to them. Guys won't bite if you say "hi" to them. Just have a conversation, and don't think of it as "flirting." If it turns into flirting, then that's great, and if it doesn't then that's fine too.|`|PB9EklObaa	Well almost all from above answers  would do Just be yourself hell ! just be honest tell him hey I like you maybe we can go get something to eat or catch a movie sometime.

t1EyGUj7aa	I've never heard of such thing. I would not recommend it though. Think about the effects it could bring if you guys have a baby. It may not affect your baby, but somewhere down the line it will. What does your family think? Are they Ok with that? If they are, it may be that you are adopted and there for they don't see the harm. But if LOVE in this case is stronger than everything......then ask god for forgiveness, move to another country, and live happily ever after|`|H4bYFqwPaa	by law you can marry your first cousin. a lot of people do. even some famous people have done that. just ask your family what they think of it.|`|AA12135516	As far as i'm concerned you shouldn't have any sort of intimate relationship with any relative whether it be from your mother's or father's side.|`|31Y7QUmkaa	i wouldn't recommend it, but if you wanted to then you should move to a swamp in Georgia and have 27 kids with too many fingers and toes.|`|ilrSUcMvaa	i dont think u should date anyone who is related to u.|`|DcmVPyHcaa	well i dont know for sure. but  i think thats illegal in the us|`|OEATSehSaa	muslims do that
JhvqUvlsaa	They do that to embarass you (get a rise out of you) and they do it because you are so close as friends. Don't let it bother you! =)
szBkbTUJaa	Ugh.I hate when this happens. My, like, bestest buddy Riley is awesome. But EVERYBODY except close friends thinks we are dating. Just like you, I love Riley like a SISTER. She has a Boyfriend. I almost have a girlfriend. But your old fart teacher is probably a just a *****. So get over it, and try to ignore it. Hopes this helps.|`|ACNECiZAaa	What this means is you are trying to fight your true feelings by telling yourself that you are not in love with him when you really are.|`|w5Oedybqaa	Go up to the teacher and say I'M NOT DATING JASON, OK?????!!!!!!!!!!!!!, that should give him the message.|`|T7uR3nT1aa	because your old fart teacher does not like you.|`|YZ9vI5ccaa	Well, I had an "older brother" that's been my bestfriend for like 3 years. Then one day we were watching a movie and he made a move.

If he really is just a friend you don't have anything to worry about.|`|6gL0iZzKaa	Eat **** bum that's from super bad trying say that to fart teacher|`|OLZYHo17aa	means you're pretty tight.|`|2RhTe54Raa	she thinks ur rite for each other.. wen ur done w/logan mess wit Jason|`|dPgc8p9saa	I hear wedding bells!!! lol your teacher sees the connection you guys have its probably like no other thats why he thinks you guys are dating!!!

AA10199093	haha yeah, it cracks my wife up.  I love seeing my wife's feet peeking out of the covers in the morning.  My wife sleeping is a turn on too.  My wife brushing her teeth, wearing her ugly pink bathrobe, reading, petting the dog, opening the refrigerator, breathing...it goes on and on.|`|lPFUfbAyaa	Women that are feminine turn me on. Well, that and 9,997 other things. Does that mean that I am easily turned on?|`|ek7Ha2sjaa	hmm...a nice sensual "licking" of the ear...thats nice...;) lol|`|DOUWdX9Oaa	yea. all my husband has to do is kiss my nipple and im hot
90ht2JH2aa	I agree. My boyfriend was one of my three best friends long before i ever thought about dating him.  There seems to be this idea that friends are off limits to date because it'll make stuff awkward...but if you're going to eventually marry someone you date, it would make sense to date someone you know you get along with in daily life and not just love atmosphere, that you trust already and know fairly well. Dating someone in order to get to know them never really made a whole lot of sense to me.  That can be awkward enough without adding in someone you barely know.|`|JgKosPJpaa	i agree with you. i dont like the idea of "dating" or going out with someone i'd rather be friends first then ask them to be my boyfriend. and when we are boyfriend/girlfriend, then we can go out just for the fun of it and not for "testing the waters" to see if the relationship will work.
B12E4rYiaa	Porn is an addiction it deadens emotions in those who get caught up in it and makes them incapable of loving anyone even themselves just like all other addictions. That's why he's emotionally distant so it's time to get going or insist on marital counseling to save this and so he can break free from his addiction and be available to be in a loving relationship.|`|ltUzwXZEaa	Let me start by telling you that there is nothing wrong with him looking at the naked women on the inter net,most men live to enjoy fantasy.There is something that you can do, one day while you know that he is looking at the naked women why don't you sit at look with him,then ask him what is it that he likes about the women and if there is something that you can do so that you can be as attractive to him as they are.Then you can take it one or two steps further by asking him if there is something special that they do that he would like to try with you.|`|fwdnXIOoaa	I had a boyfriend exactly like that.  He was a Christan and after sex he would quote the bible to me, withdraw and not want to see or speak to me until the next time he wanted to have sex.  I gave him lots of chances to appreciate me but he never did.  He admitted that he was addicted to porn and constantly masturbated.  I ended our relationship because I felt like a used door-mat.  <br>  <br>  Your husband needs to appreciate you and have respect for your feelings.  Teach him a lesson by keeping your legs closed until he gives you what you want.|`|YrqMrVfOaa	Dump him... no other way out.|`|TiOsIfi7aa	set down talk with him, tell him he got a problem and in order to fix this problem you two both need to work together. ask him does your relationship, and family means anything to him, and if does tell him that he needs help. and tell him you will be there to help him if he really cares about you and the 7 month baby. It happens sometimes in live. you have to struggle, be strong and try to find a way to solve this problem. you know those things are addictive, he could be addicted to that, and that means he needs help you are his wife and you can help him. try making him to get counseling it help most of the times. don't just destroy your life like all these people say "dump him" it sounds easy but when you actually try to do it, it is really hard. Get counseling for him and for yourself as well, and don't just throw away all your happiness right away without trying your very best to fix it. and I think you can.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you be strong|`|Wwi39lwiaa	Dump him. If the chemistry is gone, and he no longer cares, end it. You deserve to be fully loved and appreciated.|`|5e36acbf7c04a21308ae16d4bdc18239aa	Confront him about it seriously and firmly. <br>  I know it's hard to leave the one you love, and I'm not saying you should, this could be fixed, but scare him! Give him an option. He either stops looking at filth, or you will leave him. Make him believe you will (even if you feel you won't in ur heart). After being firm, later show him how hurt you are. Make him feel guilty. <br>  It's a shame that men do this, and I'm sorry. They think as long as they don't cheat that it's ok. It's not always easy to confront men about things like this. He might defend himself, but back yourself up with evidence. DO NOT SCREAM OR YELL!!! Well at least try not to. By staying calm you are showing him you are in control and you can't give him reason to leave or feel that you are being overbearing. He will realize how wrong he is if you handle it right. (unless he's a real jerk) It's hard being a girl.<br>  All the best to you hon. I hope I helped in some way?|`|njgF24Tbaa	My cat's breath smells like cat food.
vg0qxouBaa	yeah you've fallen for him by the sound of it. Not much you can do though
3a8886a7c5aedfc0a30848cd06d2d06faa	you could create a separate facebook profile and not add them, but keep the old one updated so they don't find out. you could put up the "act" on the old one and your "real" self on the new one.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Well, if you invited them and posted that info, it is not really prying, is it?  Now they know, you might as well not lie about it.  They are family, but their child chose you as their partner, you don't have to answer to them (for want of a better term) like you do your partner.  Maybe hiding it from them but then putting it on Facebook is not a good look either.  Maybe you could talk to your partner about it and then not hide it from the in-laws.  If they can't cope with tolerating the different views of their sister/ daughter-in-law when she treats them with respect, well chances are a problem was going to arise sooner or later anyway.  Hopfully your differences can be discussed in a civil manner or agree to disagree and not let that get in the way of getting on as a family.  I suspect you and your partner would have similar values, and maybe deep down, some of these values were instilled by family.  Focus on things you have in common e.g. family, sport, good shopping and food tips, any grandkids etc - might help get things back at ease a bit.  Good luck.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	well at-least you have smart in-laws.  that should count for something.|`|b6aba9d8544ca19789fd92b0c9a7b4c9aa	This is just a taste of what can happen on Facebook.Everyone can know your business, and it is pretty hard to stop that. Take this as a warning, be very discreet on Facebook. Down the line when you an employer looks at it lets hope it suggests the right image of you.|`|V0uUiAGOaa	I would polietly tell them that you are entitled to your own opinions and feelings. If they love you they will respect that.|`|DwiQ66qyaa	yea i think "person" is right....
aleWoJufaa	No, you both must be unmarried to legally wed in the U.S. His divorce must be final before he can re-wed.|`|u1uECuFNaa	No. Come on.....you should know better than that.|`|jcXsclHYaa	In my opinion he need to get a divorce. As long as he is legally married to another person, according to the law, he can;t get married with you.|`|p8yphpjYaa	No, when you're married in one state, you're married in all states. He cannot get married again until he gets a divorce!!|`|D3hYbsVJaa	No. He needs to be divorced first. He needed to file before you go all serious too. You might want to ask him to do so last week.|`|rX4ti0Nsaa	try the state of Utah. i believe polygamy is still legal there|`|coPtU10Laa	No he needs to divorce first wife before he can marry again. You should be asking why he hasn't already gotten the divorce. It's called bigamy to be married to more than one person at the same time and can lead to his being arrested.|`|KEUFaCkUaa	wow, if you didn't know this, i'd say you weren't really ready to make a marriage decision.  i mean even people who were brought up my wolves knows that.|`|AfsoZm2Gaa	No, he has to get divorced.  If he can't get a hold of her to get divorced, he has options.  <br>  **** SWEET MILDRED SENT ME TO HELP YOU***|`|1SihjQh6aa	no if he marrys you it will not be legal, he has to divorce his ex, trust me it would be a mistake if he doesn't divorce her first he can go to jail if you get married now|`|tawgKlOpaa	I'm not sure but I hope so!<br>  Marriage is wonderful and so are you!
zth3G2b6aa	talk to her!<br>  and dont be nervous! be yourself and just have fun when you are with her. <br>  all you need to do is make her laugh and she will love you that much more.<br>  Good Luck!|`|Cq2CVuhcaa	only 1 way to find out<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  speak|`|3gUetu9Aaa	Talk to her. Ask her out. Tell her how you feel. Wright a letter, it's the easyist way. I think she still likes you personally, I mean she liked you before and she texts you a lot and whatnot. Lifes too short not to. You only live once and you don't want to have any regrets.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help.<br>  :]|`|CX5RGqZuaa	yea she still likes you.
5be5f207c83c023e6bd45deedf8155d4aa	you got some nerve!!! you didnt even tell the whole story and i dont think i need to say it over and over because it wasnt my fault this happened soo go with a and stay with it!!|`|JhvqUvlsaa	D. Give it time.<br>  <br>  If she says one day that you can be friends and then the next day she says you can't, then give it more time. She is still angry and hurt and needs more time to get over those feelings. If she posts that she wants to be friends again on her myspace then see if it stays there a few days. If it does, message her and say "let's talk; I want to be friends again too." And see what she says. <br>  <br>  When you guys do talk, both of you should talk about what the other did to hurt them; admit your faults and apologize, hug, and forgive one another.  <br>  <br>  But it sounds like she needs more time to think about things. =)|`|bL9APqogaa	I would say number C. Sometimes you just need to let them think it over again and give them some space for a few days. Get her something so that she will know that you still love her and want to be friends. But DO NOT push it. When she is really, she will want to be friends again! Just don't give up on here. I know how you feel. I lose a good friend of mine for awhile. It hurt!|`|O5KwzStkaa	No way should it be A. And B is really stupid. I say C defiantly. And I think you thought C all along too because it's the longer one.|`|sAcZIRdTaa	D= My answer, To go over to her house and say look, im sorry for what ever i did that hurt you and that you see were she is coming from but you (she)also wasnt in the right... <br>  <br>  and tell her why you got mad or why you also were hurt then also i would say that it was uncalled for her to say she doesnt want to be friends anymore over a fight on the phone. then both of you need to get over it. and let it go.<br>  <br>  also for the sake of your friendship with her, both of you need to stop extending the drama, and try to go forward with a more positive attitude next time your both in a fight. because why waste time being mad or something so little. lifes to short...<br>  <br>  oh and if she still hasnt forgiven you then move on, let it go and find a friend that is not going to stay mad and act childish. because you should be able to be up front and honest with her if shes is your best friend..
hA49dFBEaa	I doubt your parents are not going to think about that sweetheart. in their eyes your still their baby girl and i'm sure it doesn't help that he's older.<br>  <br>  but if you really want to act depressed then just act like yall really did break up. i think it will take a lot of energy trying to act sad and depressed so your parents will see that you miss them though.|`|f8VeQ98Taa	thats a dumb idea. dont do it sweetie. the real question is-why do your parents hate him? im sure they have a good reason too...|`|6gL0iZzKaa	act like nothing happen and if any1 ask you how's it going with you guys tell the truth it is possible to feel better in a week or 2|`|PEhWtWcmaa	actuallly break up with him|`|90ht2JH2aa	I think it would be better to be honest with your parents....if they seem to hate all boys it's probably because they don't like the idea of you dating.  You are fairly young and they want to protect you as long as possible.  They're not being mean, they're watching out for you because it's their job.  Be honest with them.  Maybe you could have a talk to them about what they would like to see for you dating-wise and come to a compromise.  That would also make life alot easier on you so you don't have to sneak around and worry about getting caught.

1YcKHGLqaa	You guys are going through a rough patch. It happens. Every relationship hits one at some point or another, for some reason.<br>  <br>  I would wait for things to settle down a bit more and, though it's not really fair, try to go out of your way to show him you care about him, and want to help him through this. Let him know that you're sympathizing with him. It's not what you want, but one of you is going to have to budge, and if you want this to work, it's going to have to be you.<br>  <br>  Give him some space and genuinely try to work on the traits he's told you he dislikes. Do some research on the net and plan a nice date for the two of you. It doesn't have to be anything expensive or fancy: just plan a day around him. Put together a nice picnic, give him a spa treatment at home... you get the picture. <br>  <br>  After things start to settle down a bit, very calmly talk to him about how you feel, and LISTEN to him when he talks. It is not enough in a relationship to just complain about your own feelings and expect your partner to fix it. It is a partnership. I'm not trying to sound like I'm saying this is your fault; I'm not at all. I'm just making the point because very few people seem to realize that.<br>  <br>  While doing all of this, consider whether or not you are willing to do this for the long term. You know your man and his faults. Are you really going to be able to live with them all ten years down the road? If not, then you should consider ending the relationship. I understand that that sounds harsh and cruel, but for your mental health, it would probably be best.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, really and truly. I'm sorry you're in such a hard place.|`|cvBkyVRyaa	sounds like a real problem.  You will probably be better off without him.  <br>  <br>  Dump him and move on.  In the mean time you can work around the transportation issues while you learn to stand on your own two feet. <br>  <br>  If you need a relationship to get by, it is a sad thing.  It is also unhealthy emotionally.|`|0RAuPEpaaa	well unless you want to creat more strees for him tell dont break up with him he sounds like a realy good guy try and ask him to spend a lil more time with you and try to spend at least one night with me a week|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	I'm sorry to say that if he is behaving this way now, the last thing you want to do is marry him & live your whole life with someone who is going to turn away during rough times. A partnership requires 2 people working together to make it work. In my marriage we have learned that if we turn to each other during bad times instead of away from each other things seem easier to deal with, it's less stressful and your relationship continues to grow. If he can't do that or doesn't have the time to work on your relationship, I'd let him go now.
l0F7lSaraa	First of all if she dumped u to be with smeone else, she has made a huge mistake and i think that finally she will realize it, i dont know why she broke up with u, and maybe u dont either, but all we know is she has broken up despite the long time u spent together...<br>  Just know that its normal all the feelings u r going through....hurt, sadness, despair, confusion etc...<br>  You love her and she was your first love so there is no one else to compare to and right now all u can thinkis stuff like "shes the one for me", "i will never find anything liek this again, this is it for me".."Now ill be alone forever"<br>  Its normal....the person u were super close to is now gone, and whether she will come back or not..ud ont know!!<br>  <br>  right now the best thing u can do is give her space, maybe if she sees u doing ure own thing and not contacting her she will begin to miss u "U never know what u have until its gone" ...<br>  Also for ure own sake u need the distance, cuz if u remain in contact it wont fix anything..just give it 2 weeks or a month then maybe talk and see if maybe she wants to try again...<br>  <br>  If she doesnt u need to slowly help yourself, it wont be easy......it takes time, and its a day by day process, and dont jump into dating cuz most likely it will only make u feel worse cuz u will compare everyone to ure ex!!...:)|`|TqTIaSsnaa	The hell if i know|`|AhLy3rh4aa	maybe she needed to let go and be on her own|`|FnnyT1mlaa	Too young to be acting like she's married. she want to test the waters.
BCMO8TE3aa	no. that's just not right<br>  sweetie.<br>  you'll hurt your ex|`|fIXuFk6daa	Sounds a little odd that he has gone out with all of your boyfriends ex's. Honestly, does not sound like a good thing. I am not really sure why your boyfriend is still friends with him if he is dating all of his ex's... maybe guys aren't like girls on that aspect. I would leave him alone... he sounds like a pro at whatever it is he is doing to you!|`|KPt6D5Deaa	no<br>  he is a hoe.|`|psImLiPFaa	if u like it play it girl ... its always fun ... don care about ur x and y's..|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Well, your boyfriend has no right to gone out with your past boyfriends' ex.  You should go out with this friend.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	He must be into used cars,  Your are brand new and top of the line, so keep it that way,
kbGOMwi7aa	haha when i was 13 girls liked me and I was like, why??|`|AA10092586	girl i know how that feels i am 17 nd never been on a date your lucky but i think you should just tell him you don't like that we should get to know one another and see what happens email if you have any more advice ok.|`|tcCGRQSbaa	no hand holding split the check show him a cutie (girl) and hold the door open for him
XH2o1MM6aa	.Looks like this lack of communication is all about availability.Before you were quite close and able to talk every day.Now your apart,it's much harder.Maybe you should move on.This relationship is going nowhere.
fuia2Z6Maa	just tell him..
2bTeIiUYaa	Nothing.  I still act like one.  After I finish dinner, answering questions, watch a movie and give my dog a bath I plan to spend an hour or two playing with my GI Joes.<br>    My parents always used to tell me that after I turned 18 and became an adult that I could do whatever I wanted.  I told them when I was 14 that I would shove those words up their *** someday.<br>  <br>    The last time I had an arguement with my father and he spent 45 minutes bitching about how I don't act my age I corrected him.<br>    I told him  "I am an adult now, I can do whatever I want and I want to act like I'm 12 so there!"<br>  <br>    There's almost no reason to miss being a kid because there's nothing to stop you from continuing to be one.<br>    Nobody can stop you from enjoying life so bust out the Legos, Hotwheels and your Slip-and-Slide and go nuts. <br>    There is no law that says you can't and public opinion be damned.|`|X3zl9hZCaa	I love the answer above mine!!!!! All I miss is the good tv shows!
66dAMlktaa	when she's old and wrinkled, she wouldn't mind it when you ask her then...|`|hAXDWhiVaa	once shes out of her 20's, she'll probably take offense.|`|uNvF299Caa	I'm a girl but I don't think it's offensive as long as the question is asked the right way.  If it's to make me feel bad because I'm too young to know about certain things, I don't like it. Or if I'm too old.  <br>  <br>  I think if you say "it's probably inappropriate to ask you your age, but how old are you? and you don't have to answer if you don't want to"|`|VSYhHiOeaa	the key is this:<br>  if theyre under 40 years old, take what you think their age is and guess 4 years under that.<br>  if theyre above 40, up it to 6.|`|HSADGmMMaa	21. the drinking age.|`|5c190a4e5e52cca87333f5becfbec23caa	30 ....then old woman get weird. if they don't want to answer they will say "21+" or something like that
AA12164378	Maybe you should just ask her about it.  Be straight up and honest with her. It might just be a joke or she might actually be obsessed. You won't know until you ask her. Good luck!|`|O7Hzsq8baa	Its not bad to be on the internet alot but she needs to stop the lying. Tell  her to tell the truth.|`|9s1It2WKaa	I am a really cool girl who has this boyfriend his name is max and were like totally the cutest couple!!!<br>  hehehe :))|`|3y0w1qIBaa	I agreed with the first answer.  However, since that she is addicted to YahooAnswers, you may want to drag her off for a while and focus on her schoolwork in order to have a balance in her life.|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	Sometimes we all have "a friend" with a problem.  It is OK to go see someone like a counselor or psychiatrist.  You don't have to worry. We won't judge your "friend."
rLvJpWivaa	You really need to think about what you are doing & work on your self-esteem.  If you continue to have relations with him while he is back with his girlfriend, you need a serious reality check as well as a boost in self-worth.  At the bottom of the sex act itself (many times more for women, is attachment) is what you are looking for or seeking.  Is it attention, love or both?  You might also take a good look at your life to see what is missing.  Friends, family, education, spirituality & where you are going with your life in the next  few years are all important matters to think about.  Hopefully you can focus on the larger picture for your life (education, success, travel, fulfillment of your dreams) rather than getting hooked up with guys who use you.  You are not a whore because whores are paid for their services.  You are not the other slang term commonly used because you do have a relationship with him, however strained.|`|cOqVGdL8aa	No. But you're a ***** for having sex with him when he's with another girl. You only had sex twice that doesn't make you a whore. If it was two different guys, than yes people would see you this way. But apperently everyone sees you that way on yahoo answers. Its ok to not have strings attached, but its not ok to go behind another girls back.|`|d01EV6npaa	yupp. stop being such a big fatty slutface.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	How much did you charge him?|`|H7ENkTxaaa	Nice choice of words. Wash that mouth with soap little girl.|`|04F4149yaa	You're being used. His gf doesn't give him enough so he takes out sexual needs on you. Don't do it again. You will be a whore if you do it once more.|`|Kdr9CRbqaa	YES... it's pathetic how 15yr olds r getting draged into all this underage sex... do u not respect urself? or is it b/c all ur friends r doing it?|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	If you were paid, you're a whore<br>  You just sound like a hoochie|`|gew4KVFfaa	uhh yah. u seriously need to ask that question?<br>  but u need to stop having sex at the age of ******* 15! tha guy is oviously an a$$hole. <br>  <br>  sry.. i dont mean to be mean<br>  <br>  but its for ur own good. dont have sex until u are with the person u love and truley trust. not some player who only wants one thing out of u...|`|O6TC4CgRaa	I don't think you're a whore<br>  However, you're not doing the right things for yourself<br>  You're so young girl<br>  <br>  Don't walk around and jump in bed doing it with a guy who used you just for sex<br>  Wait till one day, you'll find the one that love you. The one that give you real feelings<br>  Stop being around that jerk<br>  He sounds like a jerk<br>  Dating around, cheat, player, etc...<br>  Girl, straight up your life ok<br>  ALSO, YOU DON'T WAN TO BE PREGNANT<br>  YOU'RE ONLY 15|`|Ii0Kd6hdaa	No. The Webster dictionary defines a Whore as a woman who has sex for money. This is not the case so you are not a whore. You are a slut.|`|0234a5919425f2503a2245af18fde971aa	No, you are in need of attention and you have lowered your standards.  He's not the one, you know it, but you are stuck in a negative cycle.  Stay away from him, as it will continue to happen until he decides he's done with you as a play thing.  Are you a play thing?  Of course not, so stop being used like one.  Have some self respect, start right now, and praise yourself each day for starting a better more directed life.|`|gHV2B10Taa	No, you were just curious and he took advantage of that.  Don't go for the "friends with benefits" crap.  Obviously, a guy came up with that one.  Be smarter, not easier.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Your not a whore just not very smart.|`|IGAx1FgEaa	yeah.... go **** someone else|`|mXZ4825aaa	You are not a whore!  Don't judge yourself without taking actions. Leave this alone, stay away from him. Dont call him or avoid seeing him. He is using you and he is taking you as a game. You deserve someone that will respecdt you and will not hurt you. He is hurting you, don't let him do that.|`|Q5KFND17aa	i dont even know you. and ive been told im not a judging person. but i HATE you.|`|abTZX46faa	yes, you are|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	yes, yes you are|`|d0apx2mUaa	Yes I'd judge you this way|`|qT8yID3Taa	you know, my friend is like that too. and i don't consider her a whore at all. i think that you need to be careful though. but your just livin life, and when you grow up you'll just have another story to tell.<br>  <br>  people will disagree with me, but that's how i see it<br>  [=|`|Lu918yR5aa	no ur just caught up... like.. ur probably cant stop seeing him. and it sounds like he's the whore because he's datiung some one and ******* u? wat a cheater but u mmust be way pretty then that other girl. but if u feel like a whore then tell this guy to stop and u feel like a whore and dont wanna be one. hope i helped=) peace<br>  -Vanilla|`|PVfymAdgaa	no...i think you're just confused...try to think a little more in the future ok?|`|v6KSGrlJaa	Yes Isnt your age a little to early be one..?imagine once u go to college your probably be the girl on the bathroom with a line full of guys trying to get some|`|uegmmnOpaa	No, your just young.  If you just want sex then there is nothing wrong with this arrangement.  I hope your using protection.  However, if you have feelings for this guy, you are in for some hurting.  Why would he tie himself to you when he can still get the action and have someone else too?  It just depends on where your heart lies.  By asking if your a whore I would say you are not doing this without emotional attachment.  I suggest you tell this friend that this is no longer working for you.  Tell him you have feeling for him, but if you are going to be sexual with him your relationship needs to be exclusive.  If he says no, end it and move on.  He may want you, in which case all is good.<br>  Just remember, you don't need to buy the cow if you get the milk for free.  Just as you don't need to buy the pig if all your after is a little bit of sausage.|`|BtIAB7duaa	no dont call your self that. just stop it as soon as possible. or come to an understanding with him and figure out if you are or are not gunna be with him. because if youre not thats really mean to the other girl and to yourself|`|U99DiQEZaa	No, but try to make better desions|`|7jNYqtWOaa	Um, if you are a whore, what does that make him?|`|nBjQQ3yraa	I think he is the whore.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	yes you are.|`|doHNEvf8aa	yeah sorry. but that is kinda the definition of a whore. try sticking to SINGLE guys and waiting till you get to know them before you have sex.|`|izXIAxXGaa	No, you are not a whore. You are a 15 year old girl who is trying to find out about life and love and is confused. You are not a whore, but you might want to see a nurse or a doctor ASAP to find out if you are about to become a MOM. Now in some primitive cultures, you could be married and have several children at your age. Unfortunately, this is 2009 and you need to get your life straightened out. Stay away from this boy. It's over, unless he is the father of your expectant child. <br>  Friends with benefits? Who is getting the benefits here? Don't be a fool. <br>  Be done with this loser and move on to a new guy. Also find out about getting some birth control pills and contraceptives. And could you please wait a while before fooling around with  the next guy?|`|mTqkcTtWaa	ahahahahaha yeeeeeeeeeeeahhh!! ur a bigger one for not realizing it yourself ahahaha its ok im one too haha|`|syO08G5Daa	u just shouldnt have sex period until ur emarried theres still time for change|`|u8MOrhnvaa	noooo, you are a teen, you're naturally curious about sex. just becareful not to detroy your life by getting pregnant and or getting std|`|450d7108dcc557d8dc4bb1c606d1bee1aa	No. Don't let anybody call you a whore.<br>  What you did wasn't exactly right. But, we all make mistakes.<br>  I think you should stop messing with this guy, if he goes dating your friends. And, you two aren't together.<br>  I know it might be hard to let go.<br>  <br>  But, trust me, there's another guy who will treat you so much better. :)|`|ssiqDLKsaa	YESSS, if he is dating someone he should be doin that so he is a man whore and yu are a whore for havin sex at 15|`|gpxcUtL1aa	Whore is such a dirty word.<br>  <br>  Let's call it "morally ambiguous".<br>  <br>  But really, don't mess with people that are dating someone else. There are other guys out there, he's not worth the drama and you really don't want that reputation following you around for the next few years.|`|k0G58P6kaa	yeah and he is too|`|ZoeS825Kaa	Yeah, but who cares, just play it safe.|`|kAX9xBmkaa	yes and hes just using you for sex|`|CX5RGqZuaa	yes he has a gf and you still boink him.|`|nuBix8sVaa	yup youre a whore..<br>  youre parents must be so proud|`|B462BQYzaa	he's totally taking advantage of you, i suggest that you lay low, if he calls you or messages you, ignore them and move on.  if he talks to you in person then let him know he's already in another relationship, it's not fair to you or the other girl.|`|SZvJVM2yaa	im not gonna answer this|`|7e076a0be67ad9199649156f6917847caa	No,  you're not a whore unless you got paid for the sexual services...but you do sound REAL easy and slutty....clean yourself up and don't be so willing to give yourself to anyone.

You broke up and the only way to get over him is to stop interacting with him sexually (or period). If you stop having any sexual relations with him from this day on, you are not a whore; however, if you continue you are a whore. Don't feel left out, he is just as a whore as you are. Because he is cheating on his girlfriend.<br>  <br>  Oh and another thing, you are 15, you don't need to be having sex now. You should be focusing on graduating from high school and enrolling in college. Plus 15 years from now, you do not want to have memories of you being a whore. When you look back at your high school years, you want to remember things like school clubs, prep rallies, first love, activities you done with your friends, and so on.<br>  <br>  Change for the better and not the worst. I hope you take my advice. Good luck!|`|Bo1FHj88aa	When you get herpies your a whore so not yet give it time young one.|`|ejvCttS6aa	No, you are not a whore. But, if he tells all his friends what you all did (like normal immature guys do...) he will make it seem that way to everyone he tells.... But now, he really doesn't have respect for you because you are just his booty call. He only comes to you for sex. Don't feel bad though, because he doesn't care about his girlfriend either because he's cheating on her with you. Just be safe and make sure you use protection.|`|GVT7bwDxaa	yes. <br>  Tell your parents or a school counselor,|`|Kyokb1AIaa	Victoria it sounds like you are just looking for someone to love you and accept you for who you are.

There is no such things as friends with benefits that's just a crutch to lean on and say I will give you some of me and you will give me some of you, just for fun. I'm guessing that you don't feel satisfied or happy after you don't. Know this. There are consequences to what you are doing. A little insight of guys in case you haven't gotten it yet.

Look inside and see what it is.<br>  I get so angry when I see children, so young, experiencing something God intended TO BE SPECIAL AND SACRED. Not to be taken lightly!! And to them it is like drinking water, with little thought. Not thinking what they are GIVING UP, for one brief moment. Is your life not worth more than that? Is your reputation worth that experience? My Mother told me many times in my life...."the only thing you take to the grave is your character." I think you are selling yourself cheap to a dog that could care less about your heart!!! You are worth more than that!! God did not create you for that purpose, he created you to serve him, not man. Take a good look in the mirror, you are young, and have a life-time to offer. Give it to God, he will never make you feel cheap, and one day, when you are ready, he will give you the desires of your heart, and it will be sweet, and wonderful, and pure. And you will not have to wonder or worry how others preceive you, there will be no questions to ask.

c5UAa65qaa	From the way you've laid out the factors here, it sounds to me like you already know what's best for you and what you want to do: you just don't know how to justify the decision to move to your family.  I think all you can do is let them know you love them, this is a decision that you're making for your own sake as well as that of your family, and you'll do all that you can to stay close despite the distance.  If they choose to let that come between you, that's their own fault.|`|WewCtMpzaa	It's a big decision, but it's getting popular for some to move back to the old country. My wife has relatives that live in Ireland, and if we didn't have roots here, we would be moving there or Canada tomorrow. <br>  <br>  We both love the United States, but we can see so many things that are going wrong, and it's only for starters right now, not even looking at the current recession stuff. Our primary education system is horrible, our secondary once the greatest in the world is starting to fall, including our big name Ivy League Schools who cannot compete with European and Asian Schools that are just as competitive, but far cheaper.<br>  <br>  Our jobs are descending because of globalization, where we all knew one day that when you buy all your stuff from abroad, and you outsource many of your mid range jobs, hiring illegals for low end jobs, that it is just a matter of time before all jobs get cut back because its cheaper to bring in these better trained, more competitive labor to fill in all these expensive jobs here in the States. Bank of America hired like 18,000 foreign workers to come here and run their banks for starters.<br>  <br>  Then the American Dream is slowly dying. Everything is getting really expensive to live, and it appears we are taking on a new level of socialism which should put us on par with most of the world, except that in America's case there is going to be all this huge debt which is really going to make Americans pay higher taxes one day for lessor services, so socialism without the services so to speak.<br>  <br>  It might turn around one day, I am sure the recession will one day, but all this debt, bad education, along with a few other issues will be an issue with America for a very long time, probably 100 plus years, if not 200...|`|y9N3DsKBaa	It is a personal preference.

My advice to you is to keep all your receipts when you buy things for your child, this will cut down the cost of the child support. If you do pay child support, stop spending the extra money(some women are just greedy. Sometimes in this case child support could be less than what you original pay for child before. I am a Social Worker and I see alot of cases like this one.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|UjrJDKCSaa	if you provide everything your child needs, shouldnt that include CHILD SUPPORT? even if the mom is on welfare, your child still needs to eat and be clothed.|`|5y5h5VYIaa	CAuse your the damn mother fuc*** who provied the sperm.|`|b6aba9d8544ca19789fd92b0c9a7b4c9aa	not sure what you mean.

1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Well, first of all, you need to get a lawyer.  Then you need to gather your evidence and it can't be just your suspicions and fears.  You have to actually have hard evidence of him neglecting the baby when he's in his father's care or of him abusing the baby.  It's not enough to say he's not a good person and you don't like his girlfriend.  No court is going to take custody or visitation away from a parent for that reason.  So gather whatever evidence you may have and get yourself to a lawyer who will then advise you on how to proceed from there according to the laws in your state.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Start keeping a log of these things.  Write down dates, times, etc.|`|d01EV6npaa	well first go to the officiates and tell them that you want full custody of your little bitties.<br>  <br>  ps. your ex's partner? so he's gay.......<br>  pss. or is he not....<br>  psss im not mentally unstable am iiii??? chakjadfkjghdkhjfgj hehehehehe:D

You're only 17. Whoever looks down on you because of your car/house is a stupid piece of sh-t themselves..Obviously you don't have a high-paying job or a job itself, and you're still too young to be having a nice car or house on your own. Atleast you OWN a car.. I know plenty of guys my age (i'm 18) who don't have a car themselves. Things like that are totally understandable though. I do understand that there are some shallow girls out there but why try impressing them in the first place? There are half as many girls who don't give a rat's a$s about a 17 y/o's car/house.

You should offer to purchase the sisters share of the home for a reasonable price.  Mortgages are lower now than ever in history.

I think she seems very nice, a lot of moms can make you much crazier.<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember you get to make lots of decisions later in life and pay bills and all that good stuff.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Gee it doesn't take much to make you crazy does it?|`|DwiQ66qyaa	Because she doesn't want you to be a "guest" for a more than a few hours....<br>  <br>  You can go back and hang with them later if you want...but they need some privacy too...<br>  <br>  That's my point of view...<br>  <br>  Have fun:) b a gud boy:P
0AUPrCMZaa	i am shy.  you have to ask. sorry, that's how it works :p|`|3y0w1qIBaa	The best thing for you right now is to flirt with him.  If you do that, it will increase his confidence and more open minded to ask you out.  If not, then you should make the first move if he is too shy.|`|v6KSGrlJaa	It's no big deal asking him out .. Or give him a note asking the question , other way would be talking with one of his and telling them to tell him to ask you out|`|83bTxYA0aa	well thats easy<br>  u gotta wear less<br>  dont wear a bra or underware<br>  u probabley shouldnt wear a shirt either<br>  if u wanna cover ur bottom wear a mini skrt<br>  when he gets a ***** give him a hand job...<br>  <br>  <br>  trust me, girlfriend...<br>  this ones in the bag

Bam!|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Yes, you should because most guys are too shy.|`|25mllixyaa	It's cool for the girl to make the move on the guy, but my best girlfriend once told me that: "If he doesn't have the guts to ask you out, he's not worth your time." That told me to go after this one girl I liked. But I don't know, it kind of depends on if you know this guy likes you.|`|DnmbGHfraa	do not he`ll never make you forget it , when he cheats he`l remind you when you dump him he`l remind you that you the one who made a move on him even if he was interested in you he`l put it all on you so let him make his move on his own if he lyks you and you do not wanna go out with a guy who doesn`t notice you|`|FW8zYilEaa	I don't think you should make the move but you should give him an obvious enough hint that you like him.<br>  <br>  Please answer mine?!?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArMv8A0LdbJ0qy20KhYt8IbA7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090307203622AAyaXyA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
Ti1xO4GDaa	that sounds kind of like me last year!! try to talk to him more and try not to be as shy around him. show him that you like talking to him. it sounds like he's not sure if you're interested in talking to him-- think about it..you don't want to be the one always pursing a conversation, you would like it to be mutual im assuming =] so don't be nervous just strike up a conversation!! he sounds pretty friendly, what have you got to lose.
450d7108dcc557d8dc4bb1c606d1bee1aa	She must have a thing for you.<br>  She wants your attention.<br>  if you like her, go for it.|`|JgKosPJpaa	i think she likes you...though she has a weird way of showing it.|`|Q7axONxnaa	I am really playful when i comes to boys, so I bug them to get attention. It might sound weird but it is true, I just want to talk to them and I think it is a little funny. So maybe that girl likes you. Hope i helped!|`|Qgq2hiu3aa	she maybe likes you|`|4XVqIalFaa	maybe she hates to love yaaa. lol<br>  she likes you, shes just trying to flirt with you in a elementary school kinda way lol. you know , you tease the kid you like .|`|C2w1OUR6aa	maybe she likes you and just wants you attention/ or shes just a snoby girl who only wants attention and will do anything for it... but i doubt that|`|Hg0es2S6aa	HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO she wants your attention isn't that obvious. <br>  ignore her you will see
4XVqIalFaa	i think you should give her space, but i dont think shes a true friend. you have a diabetes, she should support you, and shes being reallly selfish for getting mad at you. idk i say ditch her, shes not worth it, if shes giving you the third degree cuz your not feeling good,screw her! lifes to short to worry about annoying selfish ppl.<br>  hope i helped =]|`|8waXhvPuaa	Well she obviously isn't a true friend to begin with if she has that attitude.<br>  A real friend is not gonna say those kinds of things.

AA11879371	If she shows up only on the days you are there, it sounds as if she does.  Either that or she likes to see you work out!  In which case, it's the same thing.  Go slow - work up to it!|`|ssiqDLKsaa	possibly bu tonly time will tell
tkM1a0dWaa	Her mom is a jerk!|`|JEvnlU3uaa	Her mom is just like mine. A selfish *****. She's never change and I hope your friend can stop speaking to her as soon as possible. <br>  <br>  My mother is exactly the same way and we were always at war but now I don't speak to her because she makes me so angry that I want to bounce her head on the ****** floor. <br>  <br>  Your friend is going to be very angry or depressed if she has to stay around this ***** much longer. Her mom either needs to change or get the **** out of her life. My mother and I are still at war because I go home on the weekends. <br>  <br>  Your friend needs to talk to someone about the hurt she has inside. May she could talk to you about it? All you need to do is listen and care for her and sympathize with her. Basically all the things that her mother failed to do....I'm not saying become her mother figure I'm just saying give her a shoulder to lean on. This is hard for her. I know this because it was painful for me to. I forgave my mother but that doesn't mean I'm gonna put up with her bullshit!!<br>  <br>  And please note that if your girlfriend is depressed that means she's turned the anger towards herself. This means that she might have a hard time admitting there's a problem in the first place but just be open and don't judge, criticize, or say anything negative to her. Her mother does all that already.<br>  That's the problem.|`|m4rc3zakaa	So I'm visiting the Canadian version I'm from the U.S lol<br>  Anyway,I think you should telll your g/f to accomplish somethingg real big,do something different and then telll her to shove it in her moms face.
4ESlizXraa	See if your county clerk of court office has a website.  The records, in most jurisdictions, are public so while you may have to go down to the courthouse you can usually see such things.<br>  <br>  More rural counties may not have their records online, however.|`|p8yphpjYaa	Yep, go to the county he lived in, where his divorce would have been filed, and go to the court dockets, civil cases. You can look up anyone by name and read the dockets and party information on anything civil, like divorce, debt collections, etc. That's how I keep tabs on my ex and how he's trying to dodge child support!|`|BLaEQfdDaa	why dont you just ask him instead being sneeky about it you can tell is someone is lying about things just by body movements, if someone asked me I would tell them, I would even show them the paperwork, but thats just me, alot of times the courts will have it but might not be internet access that depends on the county, and local newpapers will also post to due the creditors.|`|JwW4bgAMaa	You can...kind of. You can use the Internet to find the address or contact information for the court where the divorce was filed and then contact them. If you are willing to pay, you can find divorce record data in seconds on just about anyone.|`|tawgKlOpaa	Why would you want to look at something so dreadful!?<br>  Think happy thoughts, you pretty thing!<br>  Puppies and lemonade!|`|djUMvICoaa	Those are county records and I don't know if they are on line anywhere, I hadn't heard of that.|`|AfsoZm2Gaa	Here's what you can do in my state:<br>  <br>  1.

rTidi7n6aa	I'm sorry to hear about your situation.  This is something that is going to take time before you will be able to move on.  Abusive relationships tend to get worse when the woman is pregnant so kicking him out was a good thing.  He is going to make you feel bad, but try not to give into him.  It is going to be hard because he is a good manipulator, but don't let him play mind games with you.  And be careful.  If he threatens you or tries anything call the police and you might want to consider talking to your local domestic violence shelter or call a domestic violence hotline.  They can give you more advice on your situation.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if I had enough points I would give the guy above me a thumbs down for his ignorant comment.|`|6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	The best advice I can give you to get over someone who has hurt you is to reoccupy yourself with things you enjoy doing to pass the time and to meet new people who are so positive that it will not lead you to have enough free time to think of calling and getting back with your abusive boyfriend.  Try to do things with your son that will help you meet other mothers.  You will have the babies in common so there will be much to talk about.  Do not answer his phone calls because that will make it hard for you to say no if he ask to come over.  Next thing you know you will be back with him and nothing will change.  You also have to think about your child.  You may think he is too young to understand what is going on between his mother and father but he understands more than you think and you have to saw him how a man is to treat a woman.  He needs to be around positive men even at this young age.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	wow  and you never seen it from the time you met him?

A guy who likes you wouldn't go out of his way to see you everyday, he really wouldn't care. He could say "hi" but that is it. Other than that, yeah I think he does, and you feel some attraction that you said you haven't in a long time, so that means there is something you like about him. So he may be the right guy for you.|`|054bfce8ce5933a083f96a2cc71caf09aa	You should talk to him more. I think it was an instant connection. and if he likes you or no yet depends if he had a connection too.

hWUXnEpMaa	12|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	I think you should wear a ponytail with all of your hair put in it. I think the bang really hides your face. Don't be self-conscious, don't feel less confident. I don't want none of that. Why am I so strongly on this. Because I was (and still a little am, I am working on it) like you. I don't know your situation, but I use to be called "ugly" all of the time in school, maybe even more than I can count. I use to believe it, so therefore I hated myself. It first started in the 5th or 6th grade and died down in the 11th or 12th grade. Now I am 17 and trying to re cooperate. I try to live with what I have, and if people don't like me, I don't like them. Most of the time, but not all, I don't get upset when people say something mean about me, but it bothers me.

0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	From their perspective, it makes good economic sense. Why spend all that money on an apartment, separate rent, food, hydro when it's really just a waste of money? Maybe he's saving up for marriage and if that's the case, you might just well have a real gem in your hands.<br>  <br>  Because there are cultural differences, you would do well to try to understand those differences. It might be a blessing for you ;-)|`|GHH1i6d3aa	He probably doesn't want to be alone, and gets along well with his mother.  He probably feels it's his duty to take care of her on some level.  So beware, even after he moves out, they will still be very close and you may be competing for his attention if you and his mom don't hit it off.  You will also probably have to make out in the car like teenagers.  Unless he lives in the basement and you can sneak in lol.  He sounds like a really great guy though.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	I guess he live with her for free ? lol Maybe he is mommy's boy?!

I am a 27 yrs old mexican and still live at home w/my parents trying to finish school. Mexicans parents don't rush nor kick their children out once they turn 18. They know that their children are preparing for their own life down the road. Finishing school and preparing to eventually marry and leave the nest for a better stable life in the future.<br>  <br>  I also have friends that are around my age that still live at home. <br>  <br>  It is just the cultural customs that hispanics or other ethnic groups carry.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	Do this guy a favor and stop dating him. Perhaps his mom is ill and needs help, perhaps he's doing her a favor by helping her out financially. <br>  <br>  If things begin 'happening', why can't you go to your house? Sweet, educated, has a great job and you can't even ask him why he lives at home?

He even pays the mortgage there, otherwise she wouldn't be able to afford it. Do you think this is the case with your boyfriend? Perhaps he's trying to make life easier on her by relieving some of the financial burden. I find that latin cultures and mediterrainian cultures have a strong focus on the sons taking care of the parents, especially the mothers. He might just feel like she couldn't get along without him, emotionally or financially. And he loves and respects her. It's perfectly natural for a boy to fear leaving the nest, however if he's mooching off of her hospitality, that is where I would say dump the bum. <br>  <br>  Also, what is preventing you both from going back to your place?|`|VjMyHAWraa	Why does there have to be a certain age your children move out? I am assuming his mom is not married? Maybe he just wants to stay with her as long as he can so she wont be by herself. You are lucky to have found such a caring person! A man like this will certainly be aware of your needs and more than likely always respect you and treat you well. Latinos have a very close bond with their mothers which i think is awesome!  you should not be annoyed by this and just come out and ask him about it! I bet you will respect him even more when yu here his answer!
83zdK7xDaa	If you don't like him, you have to be fair with him.  Tell him no, when he asks you out.  If there's a possibility you will change your mind, let him know that, but if there's no possibility, then tell him that, so he can move on.  Can't say how your friendship will be from now on.  Only time will tell.  One thing that drives me crazy (I'm a guy, by the way) is when attractive females, who are friends of mine, assume that I like them and don't even talk to me about it.  That hurts and it is unfair.  Good luck.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	I think if you don't like him back, then turning down his offer is a much better option. Just tell him "Thanks, but I just wanna stay friends for now. Is that okay?"<br>  <br>  It will be more weird to go out with him (especially when you don't even really like him) than to turn him down and stay friends.|`|0RbuSEAmaa	this could go all of three ways:<br>  <br>  1. after he could see you aren't into him so he'll leave you and not want to talk to you for a bit<br>  <br>  2. you could just go with it and see if you like it or not<br>  <br>  3. he'll be fine with it, but you'll probably feel guilty for it because he's acting so innocent about it.<br>  <br>  So good luck :)|`|DYQkOIXVaa	idk how i just thought of this<br>  but u could tell him u have a bf already from another school that he doesnt knoww!<br>  <br>  :D<br>  good luck!|`|KsYQ5HMTaa	sometimes falling in love with our best friend isn't as bad as you think|`|debe1637ce1e911c58445b0c39b08566aa	tell him i like u but we should just be freinds and its just to akward between us|`|0NDJqEYwaa	if you dont like him in that way then dont go out with him cuz thatll just lead him on and you'll be stuck in a relationship that you aren't comfortable with. and think about it, would you want to go out with someone that doesn't like you the smae way you like them? probably not<br>  <br>  just tell it like it is and things are only awkward if you make it awkward, so just dont make it awkward haha <br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|h8XSotCCaa	i think you should go out with him once<br>  you might find you really like him in the end<br>  to be honest i like this guy and i don't know if he likes me so i haven't said anything to me<br>  but apparently he knows i like him but he hasn't said anything.|`|4jU0iogjaa	tell him it would be best for your friendship if you say no and just forget about the whole situation
WQiTQGdBaa	Say something. The chances are, he likes you too. Make sure you let him know you don't want it to be awkward or for your friendship to change if he doesn't feel the same way because even if he doesn't like you back (which is unlikely), you won't want to lose your friendship. Be bold; you have nothing to lose. Otherwise, the chances are you will regret it. Trust me.|`|tFAKwsv6aa	I know EXACTLY where you are coming from on this one. I married my very best friend, we met when we were 13 and during junior high and high school days we would sometimes flirt and even shared a few kisses. But either he would pull back or I would and one of us was left with hurt feelings. What is you age if I may ask? I did not attempt to get involved romantically with my best friend until we were age 22. Even that was young and we ended up not talking for 6 months after we took our relationship to the next level. I cried for a few months and then he came back and missed being friends. So we went back to being best friends and within two months ended up with those same feelings  and ended up getting married and having three babies.<br>  Okay sorry for rambling but I want to offer you real advice here...you should remain his best friend as long as you can and trust me it will so be worth the wait and the tears you may shed occasionally. My best friend tells me now that as much as he desired me and wanted to be wit hme, he knew that it would have ruined our friendship. And it almost did ruin things when we were in our 20's. Tell me more about the situation and age if you like. And best wishes to you and him no matter what you decide to do!|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Tell him how you feel. What's the worst that could happen right??|`|VALxlwYSaa	Best advice I can give you is when it comes to love.... run the other way.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Ask him out or ask him if he likes you the same way you like him.|`|mQ5v9KUWaa	Tell him!<br>  <br>  You wont regret it :D|`|GmTs1BB1aa	aren't we all ?<br>  go for it, do it for those who can't.|`|0234a5919425f2503a2245af18fde971aa	You ask yourself if you are willing to risk your special friendship, because if you date him and it doesn't work out, well, can you really just go back to the friendship?  Tough choices, but you can get around it when you two are just hanging out and actually ask "Why do you think we never just started going out?" or something like that. Who knows. Generally, it has been my experience that many such situations do not work out and the friendship is compromised in the process. BUT, on those rarer occasions when they do, it is magic and forever...but it is rare.|`|NqMx7YOtaa	Try to start flirting with him a little, and test the grounds. On one hand, bestfriends are always the best boyfriends. But I think you should try and see how he reacts to you flirting with him before you tell him. Guys rarely ever are JUST friends with thier best girlfriends...so chances are you dont have to worry about that.|`|r0huEwgcaa	I agree with your mom (I mean one of the people who answered, not your actual mom lol). I am in the same place and am waaaaay to scared to tell him. ;) do it for those of us (like me haha) who can't. I wish you the BEST of luck!!!!!!!!!!|`|ZpmLzxpyaa	WARNING!!!!! Make sure your friends feelings are mutual. If not it could mess up your friendship. also if you do go out when you guys break up it could seriously break your friendship.|`|AA10189776	go for it<br>  <br>  don't worry about what might happen or if you can't be friends<br>  <br>  odds are things will actually work out... and the relationship will prosper|`|dPgc8p9saa	you shud definitely tell him!! im sure he feels the same way if u guys are super close!! u have nothing to lose right now take a chance or you'll never know and you'll just give some other girl a chance!|`|hhRuKIzRaa	your best guy friend will be ok with you loving him...even if he doesn't feel the same way.|`|cvBkyVRyaa	tell him.|`|KOjVWXOCaa	Let him know how you feel, don't wait any longer. Go for it before someone else takes him. Life is too short, you will never know what could have happened unless you try. You surely do not want to be one that say I should've, could've, would've, but I didn't, now he's married. Go get your man.|`|2keE82GJaa	This must be hard for you, as for you being around him alot, and having him acting to you in a friendly way.<br>  I think you should let him know how you feel though, and if he was your bestfriend, he would understand you.<br>  Who knows, maybe he likes you, and is as shy to let you know too :) xx|`|sEc5XbK1aa	you should prbly drop hints to him and try to see how he feels about u and then you can try to tell him if ur heart really wants too....just follow ur heart gurl|`|xhX7akuPaa	Tell him...|`|LxZXNDYLaa	go 4 it!!!! if u 2 r that close then it shoudnt B a problem!!! fave fun!!!|`|8Bs7OFfOaa	So am i hun.<br>  Tell him!!|`|51cd856f9c2a18d1e26ffbefc3cea6d8aa	tell him....|`|uzySXITWaa	thats what happened to me.<br>  and now ive had my bf for 2 years (:|`|TZhfrmwHaa	me 2.. join the club.. <br>  haha, i'm going to ask him to prom, <br>  i don't know wat to tell u though...

Who knows? maybe some do but are too shy to tell you.  Just hang in there and Im sure youll find a good guy.|`|Ruw7mXj6aa	hey whatever your name is dont pay any attention to those other girls when they get older there most likey going to be std infested sluts your 11 your too young to have a boyfriend wait until your like 14 and dont make stupid decisions|`|rUPVDszEaa	11 is young to be thinking about dating. You shouldn't care what the popular kids say. And braces don't get caught to another person's teeth (normally). You will find that special someone.
eGpOIV12aa	this guy saw this friend of yours and thought she was hitting on him.<br>  men are simple minded in nature. they take the first thing that appears on their plate.<br>  <br>   for you to get him to forget about her and pay attention to you, the easiest way would to act all mad at her and complain to him about her. telling him how the other girl played him and you two have something in common. not liking your friend. once you have the guy, then you can make up with your friend if you want
iTk7aaYdaa	oh how funny lol, i am experiencing da same thing, except im da girl in my situation(:<br>  <br>  no lol, im like dat...i nvr start up da convo jus cuz i feel like if he starts it, it meanz dat he is still interested...its kinda a personal thing for me..i wud nvr start up da convo first unless i knew for sure dat he wud answer<br>  <br>  she prolly duznt have a very high self-esteem :(<br>  she duznt wana get her hopes up, she wants u to surprise her & she prolly lovez it wen u im her :D|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Just pay attention to her reactions, see if you are boring her or distracting her. You could also ask her, "Am I boring you?" or something if you wanted to.|`|qiUYTCnzaa	so...whats the question?<br>  you should tell her you like her, thats all a girl wants. seriously, tell her.|`|KCzzzCu2aa	idk normally i would say yes but if you guys talk for hours then i dont see how that could bother her, she would stop the conversation <br>  <br>  btw the first girl is really rude, she should at least try and answer the question|`|4AHGY6jnaa	yes. you'll seem needy. let her start them and call you sometimes. then rarely you can aim/call her. don't make it too often so she'll be suprised and happy when you call.|`|c5COgNGaaa	no.. not @ all. why would you think that!? girls like it when the guy can be the one to start up a conversation. personally im not great at starting up conversations so if the guy can, thats always a plus!|`|qZOuxR1Raa	i'm a girl, and i know how girls think. sometimes when talking to a guy, we don't know what to say because we don't want to look stupid or make the guy think of us wrong. Also, its just the playing hard to get game.  A lot of girls wont start a conversation because they think it'll make them look desperate. In a way, it's kind of expected for the guy to start a convo. I know its messed up, but some girls expoect guys to do EVERYTHINGG. For me, i think guys should make the first move but from then on its up to both of them to make things work and make them interesting. Just bring it up. One time say "i always bring up a subject, you bring one up this  time", I can almost guarentee it will work.|`|Q0HEpw3jaa	Do you talk to her in real life or just on AIM? Generally if a girl likes you she will IM you first at least half of the time. She seems like she is just flirting with you and talking to you to lead you on and she has no crush. I could be wrong but the best thing is to not IM for a few days and see what happens. If she likes you she will make an effort to talk to you and if not, I'm so sorry, but you will get over her.|`|PhPwAGVNaa	Cute.  But your best bet to start a conversation not on AIM.  Try hanging out.  Try getting her number.<br>  <br>  But just as a warning, girls are flirts, remember that.  Be careful not to let her fool you.|`|o3UYhXNdaa	You wouldn't be a pest because most girls like when other people starts conversation.As a tip when u start the conversation have the topic be on her or something she like or even something u have in common. good luck!|`|Jq4TdGShaa	wanna help me?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlZBuN7mOCeBJukCfbk_J4nsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307204703AArztLn">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|RSWsmYAYaa	you might <br>  try and ask something really simple and maybe she will start the conv.|`|QRqNsyA3aa	not really<br>  if you talk for hours<br>  and hours<br>  isn't that a good sign?

0IpfhSqiaa	It's normal for your friendships to change or even break when you get older, but you should still keep some truly close to you. You kinda come off as shallow if you switch around too much, people will see you as just chasing fun. Maybe it's because you've been through a lot in the amount of time and you need friends that adapt to who you are in the moment. Try to build your friendships up, and they can be something meaningful rather than just a string of memories.
RFeYz59maa	I think you should make a few attempts to see if anything is bothering her and see what the deal is. If you try to talk to her but she's not very responsive, then I say let her come to you when she's ready. She probably needs a break from you, is mad at you, or just doesn't want to be your friend anymore.|`|RVLTubfYaa	I constantly move my best friend around on my top friends. It doesn't matter which position she's in to me, But I've never moved her like 11 spaces. She might be passively letting you know she's upset with you. Have you asked her why she's been so moody lately? Maybe she has a lot going on at home-or something happened to her. It sounds like you haven't made much of an effort to keep in touch with her, and that in turn could have caused her to think you and her aren't that good of friends anymore, and are losing the friendship. Pull her to the side, call her up, or write her a really long letter addressing your concerns. Talk to her and see what's up, hopefully you'll learn what's been going on. You also mention that you "get tired of switching best friends so often though." You say "should i try to get a best friend back or just find a new one?" Best friends are not a pair of shoes you go to the mall and buy. A BFFL is exactly what it means. Just because she's moody and reclusive doesn't make her an expendable friend. Friends are the thick and the thin, good times and bad. You're coming off like you don't care a little, and that could also be what your friend thinks, and maybe your old best friends did too. I'm not trying to flame you-I really do want to help.|`|0qspJSt9aa	well you can ask this advice on jamrie.com<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!
V8dXNAGeaa	You need to talk to someone you can trust.  Someone you can really talk to--elaborate on all the details and leave nothing out.  Honey, you need to talk to a psychiatrist.  Don't feel insulted by this matter.   They'll be there for you and really help you through the situation.  In the mean time, whenever you feel your blood pulsing in your ears and your agitation about to spill over, hold your breath, count to twenty, and exhale.  Suck in a deep breath.  Let it out.  Focus completely on breathing and on breathing alone.  Tune everything else.  Hear nothing but the sound of your beating heart, your breath coming in, coming out.  Steady pace.  Inhale, exhale.  Inhale, exhale.  What you need to do is learn how to slow down, how to start with little steps like calming yourself down.  Don't let your tears get the best of you.  Don't let your emotions run wild.  Compose yourself, and once you get in the doctor's office, then you can break down, let everything loose.  Let the psychiatrist help you, heal you, help you find the happy person you once were.  It will feel so much better if you talk it out, if you focus on breathing, if calm down and take one step at a time.<br>  Good luck.|`|081168f28573ebfa7f89cf91f00a1e36aa	Honey, you really need to talk to someone and get some help.

They can really help, especially if you're as scared as you say you are.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	it may be hard to talk about, but I think you want to tell people. Stop hiding fro mit and meet it face on. It also  wouldn't hurt for him to step up and make a big overture to counter this.

It really helps.|`|kjRGIVzqaa	Do you have kids? You may need to take a break from him. I don't know that anything will fix this except time. You might need to visit a clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist to discuss it. I don't usually recommend them, but for this, yes. Your husband should understand it. <br>  <br>  Also, if he is not willing to listen to you about this particular issue, that's a problem. I understand that he may be worn out dealing with it, but he caused it. You are not a machine, you are human. But if you are talking about other issues, then if he just doesn't listen, that's a real problem. When I ask my son a deep question, I don't talk, I just listen, until I am sure he's said everything he needs to say. that is what people usually need, listening-wise.<br>  <br>  If these issues are becoming significantly troublesome to go beyond asking questions here, then you'll probably want to visit with a pastor or a professional marriage therapist.
gsyhNAiRaa	Fighting isn't the best answer especially if your going to do it at school. Many schools now a days are filing criminal charges against students for fighting or at least threatening kids with possible charges to scare them. Here are some things you can say to him that may at least piss him off:<br>  <br>  Does you mom own a refrigerator? Because I thought lesbians ate out all the time.<br>  <br>  I'm going to walk around your house naked to show you who has the biggest ding dong! (say it just like that)<br>  <br>  (if he says something like I'm going to kick you *** then say) Why don't you put that in your resume and use it to get a job. Or why don't you go put that in your diary.<br>  <br>  Try to think of different comebacks it may be hard at first but before long you'll be tossing out comebacks left and right without thinking about it.|`|KSlbDaGgaa	Fighting is for brutes and morons. If you truly want to fight him, do it in his own head. When I was still in school (I'm 18 and often had the same problems you described) I would often find myself on the receiving end of cruel jokes and such. eventually I found a way to combat them. Do to all the slander I found myself becoming pretty quick witted. and being in school you could get dirt on anyone, So attack him mentally, if you do it right you could put him into a deep depression and completely break him down. Find his weak spot, and attack it relentlessly. Granted ignoring the situation entirely would be best, as confrontation never ends well. But if you feel you MUST confront him, I still suggest somehow attacking his thoughts and feelings. A hit on the inside takes longer to heal than one on the outside if done properly

7ul6zeI8aa	I was with my ex from the time I was 15, just turning 16, to the time I turned 18. It heals over time, it took me months to get over. I found a new guy a moved on, it happened when I decided for myself that I was not going to think about him anymore and there was good reason for what happened that made us break up. My ex and I now talk as good friends, but he says he misses me. I learned from the mistakes there and know better now.

There are some guy friend's where I can see myself going out with and then there are others that I would never go out with (and it doesn't really have anything to do with their looks). She probably values your friendship and wouldn't want to ruin it. Try being friends with her and maybe she'll come around and realize she likes you too, but sometimes friends cannot go out. Sorry and good luck! :]
Q3ibC4Rnaa	The sooner the better! My wedding is next Saturday and I booked my place back in Sept, and I had to go with a different time then I wanted because it was already starting to book up. March isn't even wedding season, and it was already starting to fill up!!!! September is about the end of the wedding season, I think it's from April - October, but because of this peak - this is the worst time to wait! Even though things are the way they are (and it really isn't as bad as the media says, and it all depends on where you live as well. My part of the country is doing well so it wouldn't help at all to wait!) you're trying to hold off during the busiest part of the wedding season. I'd say, if you know what you want, go ahead and book it, otherwise you'll just set yourself up for disappointment. I don't know what to tell you about how to explain this to your parents, good luck on that, but do what you can to get your place now. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YooAAgNZaa	I doubt much truth all the events of this importance should be planned with a long time ago. <br>  I hope you have good luck and get everything as you need it. <br>  congratulations on your forthcoming wedding...|`|foVfETb2aa	I would find a few places you like and ask what the booking dates are looking like that will help you make a more informed decision. I started looking in oct when I got engaged and I will be getting married this month. But here it was easy to find a place... I wish you all the luck in the world. Just so you know there was a place a girl booked here in Oregon and right before her wedding the place went bankrupt so your mom has a point too.|`|vyL7yEleaa	if you were saying your wedding was in June and July i would be a lot more worried. you want to book the venue ASAP to make sure you get it, September is not as busy a month when it comes to weddings as you are getting out of the bridal season, but it can still book fast.<br>  <br>  most places will accept a few hundred dollars down payment to book the date, some if you explain to them what is going on will sometimes go even lower as long as they know they are getting money. <br>  <br>  i know the economy is bad, but brides will spend money even if they economy is bad XD there is no such thing as a bad economy to a bride|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Wow, you really should have already booked your venue to guarantee your date. <br>  You know what you should do to get your mum to agree, start calling places and checking their availability. Most will already be booked for that date, you might be lucky to find one spot. So then show your mum the places you have called, show her how booked out they are and tell her that there is definately not going to be a better deal later on as they already have all the business they need.|`|L6DZZ6SJaa	my fiance and I were engaged a year ago, and are not getting married until October 2009. We booked the venue right when we were engaged... we are getting married Oct 3rd because it was (literally) the first available Saturday the venue had. Being completely booked almost 2 years in advance is not common, but I would not suggest waiting that long. You will get stuck with the venues no one else wanted by then (if there's any avail at all). Most wedding planners suggest booking about a year in advance. I would book as soon as possible.
R8VhFeEVaa	This is not too early. I'm getting married on the same day and I've already booked a place. You don't want things to fill up. And by the way, September is the most popular month to get married this year, (09/2009), last year it was August. Don't panic. Prices will go up and choices will go down the closer to the wedding you book. <br>  <br>  You could find a place though. The last wedding I planned, I planned in one month total time before it happened. <br>  <br>  Check out this website. Its very resourceful as far as ideas and links to local businesses go. <br>  www.theknot.com<br>  <br>  Also, keep your mind open for where you would want your reception to be. It could be a lot of fun to have it in a restaurant, or a bowling alley. Half the fun of planning a reception, is going around to different restaurants and telling them that you are thinking of using their facilities for a wedding reception. You'll get the best service you've ever had in your life. You've got the church- that's the hard part. Its not ridiculous to try to book a venue in early June. <br>  <br>  Have fun with this stuff, don't stress about it, just play.|`|iDfRTLklaa	I would suggest you sit down with your parents and explain to them that the reception is the first thing you need to finalize as any good venues will be booked out months and even years in advance.  Maybe you can find some magazine article to back you up, and show them how vital it is to book the venue|`|vyL7yEleaa	you need to only ask this question once.. posting it multiple times isn't going to get you any different answers.<br>  <br>  Edit: before you go giving me negative marks.. try looking at the question under this and a couple down.. she's posted it three times.. same question|`|C6IFaaEaaa	You could wait and take a chance the date you want is not available. since you've already booked the church having the dates coincide is important.<br>  <br>  This idea might buy you some time.  Call the venue and TENTATIVELY book it, without laying down any money.  Tell them your parents are insisting you consider other options, but you have really already decided.  Tell them you will get back to them as soon as you have satisfied your parents requests to consider other options.  (Make your parents the heavys!)  Also ask that they give you first right of refusal if someone else should want that date.  With the current economic situation, a venue might just agree. (A little pleading goes a long way too).  Doesn-t mean you're going to get a deal, but the bottom line is you get the venue you want.  Hopefully this will buy you some time.|`|q84KT11saa	Depending on how popular the venue is the sooner you reserve the better.  It is possible you can reserve it 2 or 3 months before the wedding.  Best bet is to call the venue your interested and ask them what spots they currently have available for that day.  If they are already having a hard time squeezing you in, you might not have much luck later on.  Once you find out this information talk to your parents about it and explain to them what you found out.  That might get them to consider doing it now.<br>  <br>  If you can't afford to book the place yourself, then you really don't have much choice other then to listen/wait for your parents.  Is it possible they just can't afford it right this minute and want to wait a little later till they get some money?  They might just be trying to save themselves some face.  Either way, unless you can convince your parents to put the money down for it now, you have no choice but to wait.|`|HQsmRzPsaa	i don't think a place changes their price booking it closer to the event date. the season will change the price, like a winter wedding would be cheaper but i don't think booking it 3 months in advance is cheaper than 12 months in advance. plus if you don't book your venue first you can't really book other vendors like a DJ, caterer, officiant because they will need to know where it is first to calculate their cost for travel time, set up and other stuff. i really don't think it will change the price. book a place, pay for the deposit and don't tell them! act like you are waiting then tell them a few months before the wedding. plus if you wait the place you want might get booked for that date.|`|8bTder08aa	Ooooh, the thought:  you can't get the exact precise one-and-only perfect satisfactory nothing-else-will-do venue:  your life will be ruined.  You will cry bitter tears every time you think about your wedding.  Your life will be dust and ashes, everything will be wrong wrong wrong rotten rotten rotten.  You may as well tear your hair out and rend all your clothes, beat your breasts and wail your misery to the whole world right now!  Why even bother to get married if you can't have the venue you want?<br>  <br>  Now if you can read that and not laugh at how stupid it sounds, you are seriously pathological, actually mentally ill with a narcissistic personality disorder, and I'm not kidding about that.<br>  <br>  You are going to be marrying the man who you love, and who presumably loves you, more than anyone else in the whole world.  It shouldn't matter a rat's @ss, seriously, where your wedding and reception are held.  You need to get a grip on yourself and understand that it is not any of the externals-- the church, the reception site, the flowers, the gown, the favors, or anything else that matters.  It's the occasion, and the way the occasion comes off is going to be determined in large part by YOUR attitude.<br>  <br>  If the damn venue matters so much to you, then sell something you own or work at a second job or pawn something so you can pay for the venue yourself right now.  IMO if you aren't willing to do something like that to secure the venue, then it really isn't that important to you, you're just being a high-maintenance pain the patootie kicking and screaming and turning red in the face over something that doesn't matter because you want your ego stroked.<br>  <br>  If you don't get the place you want, you'll get some other place-- and since you aren't paying for it, who cares?  So why not get over yourself, relax a little, and stop thinking that there's only one perfect venue and it's a catastrophe if you don't get that?  Show some grace and graciousness to your parents and some maturity in your attitude.|`|Likst1Mxaa	If YOU don't have money, don't get married. Sheesh, it's not that hard. Just change your church reservation for a different date which aligns with a day you can get a reception venue.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, venues are booked years in advance. i'd get in quicker, just coz there is a recession doesn't mean things will be cheaper.|`|bFfWFsFWaa	I think you should get it now. It's your wedding. What's the biggest fear...<br>  Not getting the place at all?<br>  Paying more then you could have?|`|jYPeis3Saa	depending n how large you wedding is you may, but chances are you wont. <br>  <br>  when i was planning my wedding 3 years ago, and looking for places for our reception i had to book at least 9 months in advance. <br>  <br>  maybe call the place you want ot have it at and ask what their schedule looks like for september and ask how likely it is that you will be able to book on you're specified date 2 months in advance. <br>  <br>  <br>  honestly, you need to book your venue now. if you cant afford the place you want, then find a cheaper place or cut the guest list down to a more affordable number that YOU can pay for.|`|sLLgERQWaa	Call around and ask the prospective venues when THEY say you should book....then tell your parents what these places say.....<br>  <br>  Back in 1974 one had to book anywhere from 6 months to a full year ahead of time depending on the venue....I doubt it has changed, especially if you want a banquet hall or restaurant.<br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with you waiting....and everything to do with availability.....most people have been saving for their wedding for quite a while , wedding dates are booked as a  first come first serve (with deposit)...waiting until the summer won't get you a better deal if the date is no longer available,even if prices drop, and there's no guarantee of that, and how Mom can guarantee you will get the place you want if you don;t find a better deal by summer makes no sense, as most brides book far ahead of time to insure they have the date they want. With the more popular wedding months, booking far ahead is the only way one can insure one gets the day one wants and waiting until a scant 2-3 months cuts  your chances way down in getting the day you want<br>  <br>  Your parent's are living in La La Land, IMO....<br>  <br>  Proof is in the pudding....get the info from the source-fact over opinion, dear.....armed with the facts you present your case to your parents..........and cross your fingers against them being that stubborn.
ZfleGhXLaa	Yep, I had a similar situation (Ordered the dress early, had lost weight by the time it arrived and it was waaay too big)<br>  <br>  My alterations cost less than $30, and the dress looked just fine.  Taking a dress in is apparently a much easier alteration than taking it out.<br>  <br>  I used the seamstress at the same bridal shop where I ordered the dress.  She had me put it on, I was told to wear the same undergarments I would be wearing on the wedding day so she could be sure no part of my bra would be showing after the alterations.  If it is a floor length gown, bring the shoes for altering length too.  She just pinned up the dress in a few places, and I had to take it off being careful not to disturb the pins.  I came back when it was finished to try it on and make sure the fit was good.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	ya just wait untill maybe 2 weeks before the day and take it in and try it in in front of them so there is no mess ups! just make sure you go to a good place!|`|AA11139669	Yes, you can get it altered. Just make sure you know from the bride about length and everything....sometimes doing extreme alterations can change the look of the dress!
9UQlhzitaa	well stop worrying about liking him and treat him as if he were any other friend you have and see how he reacts to that.When he compliment you return one in kind and just let the convo roll from there.<br>  <br>  He may like you but not enough detail to tell you yes or no.Just watch his body language and his actions toward you. if he is always around and always close at hand then he likes you but then how much becomes the question|`|pCQlDDf3aa	ur gorgeous!:P

oHO0XOQVaa	You're not noticing it when they do or you need to come out of your shell more. That's a lot of work for one person to have to coax the other.|`|4BoteYDwaa	The girl has to appear interested and approachable. If I think the girl isn't interested or doesn't drop some sort of hint,  I usually won't waste my time trying to chase after something I can't have. The shyness, could easily be mistaken for "not interested". If someone smiles at you and you try and hide (not saying you do...) it may appear as if your trying to avoid the person.|`|q2H9jgDSaa	I'm sorta shy and i get hit on.<br>  maybe you should make yourself more approachable,<br>  or maybe you don't exactly know what flirting is.<br>  because guys  may flirt with you and you just don't know it. <br>  I dunno, <br>  but guys will flirt with you if they think that you're hot.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	Shy girls usually seem uninterested. If she'd at least smile, I'd come up to her and start a conversation.

But they make it seem "joking" so that if the person isn't interested the guy can say: "Oh, I was just kidding!"<br>  But then again, if the flirt-ee goes with it, they know where they stand. Boys aren't always as stupid as we make them out to be.<br>  <br>  Too frequently the shy person thinks they are being mocked, however, and will completely ignore the source of the attention. The fact is, though most of it is subconscious, the boy just fears rejection. You know that thing about cheerleaders being intimidating? Ha! Shy people are much more so because they seem harder to please. They prefer to stick to themselves, make you often feel unspecial. Guys don't like that. They want to see smiling, laughing; some sign that they are liked.<br>  <br>  But then there are the sweet, quiet ones, and although it may be oblivious to them, plenty of men start chase. You just have to wait, honey, until the hormones die down a bit and they seek a "steady relationship".<br>  <br>  In all honesty, I love the silent ones. They are normally very intelligent and that amounts to ninety-eight percent of what I ask for in a companion.|`|rH4hN5QRaa	Being a guy myself, i would have to say its because at least when it comes to me, i need some sort of signal that it is okay? I don't ever try to do anything with a girl that doesn't give me a sign its okay to. I'm shy though myself so this may have a little bit to do with it. Good Luck though in the future! :)|`|nYntQhBoaa	Some do. But being so shy, it can be hard to tell who's trying. Its ridiculous how hard it is to keep a conversation going with shy girls. I used to be super shy, and finally this year i became more open, and i've already had two relationships, made more guy friends, and been asked to hook up multiple times.|`|pQw80POJaa	They tend to go for the girls who are aggressive and self-confident. Shy usually means that the girl is insecure or isn't fully comfortable with herself. Just be more aggressive and flirt with them first.You said that you're cute so just tap into your inner Grrrrrl and let her loose. Lol.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|XJi0l3JUaa	Guys have to feel that spark.  Also, if you don't talk, how are they supposed to get to know you.  Also, many times guys that go for extremely shy girls will want to take advantage of them because they think the girl is too shy to say no or tell someone if something goes wrong.|`|VCRa7y5xaa	wow i am talking to a girl who is very cute but very shy and nerdy...i like her a lot, the only thing that makes me sad is if she wont feel comfortable when we go out...like she is not the party type, but i want to take her to clubs and parties with people drinking and smoking (when im not)...i want to spend time with her! were 19|`|r8VvBxM6aa	It might be because they don't want offend her or make her feel uncomfortable. <br>  If you have a boy you like and he's not approaching you, then you make the first move :)<br>  <br>  btw i've started an advice column on youtube about questions like this. if you want to check it out and comment whatever other questions you may have i'd be glad to answer them. :)<br>  <br>  just go to youtube.com and search for thatbrowngirl890<br>  <br>  or go to the link directly<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqlEYydebvg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqlEYydeb...</a>|`|l7VOXWTEaa	they are shy themselfs? i know i am and some1 it seems they are out the shy's guys league b/c of there past realationships that how i feel wen  i know a cute girls likes me can u possily help me<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmUuI2Gs.6L0LUWpMyYprjnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307205404AAMb3TM">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|dBRxfRGqaa	because they are not interested in anybody that's not like them. they always want the girls who would make them look more popular.|`|zNR9Ik3Daa	shy girls sometimes come off as boring or bland.<br>  if there's nothing for them to notice, there's nothing to chase.|`|fF4lfNaHaa	uggg i have the same problem( im not saying im cute lol) i think its cause most guys r shy too and the more talkative girls r easier to approach|`|mpgpImZyaa	Some guys do go for the shy girl.<br>  Maybe try putting yourself out there a little more and catch their interest.|`|ibeFIUpkaa	uh I do?

AA10545938	Well, you seem as if you have tried your hardest to be their friends. Especially the second one. You have tried to help her as much as you can. You should probably stop being friends with her. It seems that she has to many problems in her life and that you shouldn't be involved in them. Eventually, if you keep trying you will fall in the same category as her. "LOSER". She seems to have major problems in her life.

Shes pretty, granted its not the best picture, but I can see her being pretty.|`|HqKQSJ5naa	12 she looks like a hooker.  <br>  Average confused girl.|`|vR4k5iVCaa	she looks 15 in the face but she looks like shes trying to dress older. that outfit is not very appealing there are ways to dress older without looking cheesy|`|7kga2aRBaa	she looks 15 or 16. so its not like she looks heaaps older. but she is very pretty.|`|4XVqIalFaa	c'mon if she seriously thinks shes ugly, she has issues.|`|esPAi8Dfaa	her face is ugly!|`|ke1SgRxTaa	avg
m1mGw5ISaa	Wow I'm 18 and marriage is the last thing in my mind it's good to live your life and really find yourself and who you are and then get married experience is everything and getting married that young you lose out on alot of things in life afterall you are gonna be married for most of your life so why not have fun living life but I guess if u found mr right and u believe u can't lose him than I guess u go for it but your young just think about it befor u tie the knot good luck in life :)|`|cd8bb7da86b425b8f404e714fd49fe11aa	It's a big mistake. You think you know everything now, but you have no idea who you even are yet, and the person you're with has no idea either. It's better to wait, and if you are both on the same page after college and getting a career, then yes, by all means get engaged. Until then enjoy a promise ring and each other's company.|`|hD5WSYbpaa	First of all, it is NOT illegal to be engaged. <br>  <br>  I think that it all depends on your relationship. In most cases tho, things don't work out with early commitments between teens. Maybe it could work out, Hopefully it does.<br>  But teenagers are teenagers. They are overly dramatic about everything especially love. I should know, I am a teen myself.|`|Q4Hk5Kvpaa	Well, it's your choice, but I think you're making a big mistake. You're not even your own person yet, and if you 2 feel so strongly about each other then marriage can wait, if you really love each other that much then you should still be together when the more appropriate age for marriage comes. And if your not still together by that time, then I'm sure you'll be glad that you weren't married because you wouldn't have to go through all that nasty divorce sh*t.|`|pxNnXwwBaa	well.... its ok to be engaged, but to be engaged that early it sort of bad. but it all depends on how you love that person but if you really love that person, the best idea is to wait and your lover will wait for you if they really do love you as much as you love them.|`|St7Y2Ldkaa	Honestly, I think you're proving your immaturity by getting engaged so young. The human brain doesn't fully mature until age of 21. So, if you still want to get married then, go right ahead. But otherwise, don't. You're going to struggle a lot more if you get married ASAP. I say after 21, get married. Before, don't even try! :D|`|Ly1YUt42aa	if you love him, i wish u the best of luck....<br>  God knows, you both arent gonna work out, unless well, you both bend ur back and compromise until ur like 20, thats when ur mind has fully mature and well, like teens change everyday and its hard to accomandate with and well, once ur mind is more mature, everything is a lot easier...<br>  <br>  but yea, i dont think its gonna work, good luck|`|XzsmYWOqaa	DON'T DO IT!  it is a guaranteed divorce, trust me.  And please don't go get knock'd up, that will only make things worse.  A good age to marry is in your 30's.  HAVE FUN NOW AND IN YOUR 20'S, you won't regret it!|`|vyL7yEleaa	way way way to young, i made that same mistake and i regret it completely.|`|99kKci9caa	way to young, you still need to understand life, don't ruin it this early by making the wrond decision|`|gayDcP57aa	honey you need to live your life before you get married you are way to young for that|`|eGn09jolaa	I say if your in love then do it. Its your life. You live and learn.|`|AA11839888	if its a long engagement ,fine, but you never said who is 16 and who is??. just too young.|`|ayby0npIaa	too young. why are you engaged at sixteen?|`|dsivvZm4aa	very bad|`|KpxVsPZSaa	that's bad and so gross at the age of 16.|`|n1r8tG81aa	oh dear...help the poor children|`|FIG58FVpaa	I think most people at 16 are too young to be engaged. I don't know the whole situation... but most people aren't mature enough to be married at such a young age.|`|JK2RvliYaa	at 16 you are not the same person you will be in 10 years. think about it at 16 you change your mind about what you like &don't like all the time. what's to say you will love this guy forever. plus that is limiting yourself allot.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Been there, done that, got the t-shirt and pawned the ring.<br>  <br>  The next time you get engaged, people see that as a joke too.|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	I think you should have a long engagement.  Don't rush it.|`|JxUFDutxaa	BIG<br>  MISTAKE.|`|hXdt1lntaa	too young|`|HwjYCfLJaa	You should wait. You are going through a lot of changes right now, and it's easy to get caught up in love. If it really is love, there should be no problem with waiting until you are older. If, when you're 18, maybe even older, and you still feel the same, then go ahead. Then you'll know for sure it's real|`|hsZnjZvoaa	I don't think much about it at all.. at least not good thoughts.  Kids today try to grow up too fast, then at the first signs of trouble, they run.<br>  <br>  Please think long and carefully and don't rush into anything... give yourself time and let nature take its course.|`|bgtNYOp5aa	gross, illegal and he should be arrested. Why do you think it is illegal for a man to be with an underage girl? I bet the husband is like what 40 years old and has brainwashed you.|`|5sTPhPGiaa	* BAD * idea.|`|ZRS6V6Rcaa	not in America|`|1qTNn8qnaa	>.<...okay =) watever floats ur boat.|`|76db084b0636ae593b0b3c0e95cb3838aa	I think why?|`|RFUgLmxyaa	What is the gain from that? NOTHING.
qGP1cFCMaa	I am now 28. I was also a 16yr old mom at one time. She shouldn't be treating you that way. I mean she sounds like a (little kid) trying to start a cut down fight. I think it shows true colors to bring your parenting skills into it. I mean if she has some feelings about you personaly, address that. It sounded like she was just mad trying to hurt you.  You just tried to ask her nicely-SMART. I would be as nice as possible if there is any chance to get your stuff back. It may be she doesn't have it and is starting a fight with you so she doesn't have to talk to you about it. That is probably why it's so irrational too. She's just trying to change the subject. Contacting the post office might work too-  I mean it's worth a try.  If all else fails tell her you won't be mad at her, just tell you the truth about the stuff. I  wouldn't rely on her as a BFF anymore. She is obvious trouble, and could really give you alot of grief with your family. She showed you her true colors, get out of the friendship ASAP before she does something worse. Sorry so long too!!  :-)|`|ced900a717a4f9b75128124af402c7d4aa	This is a 16 year old. Even though shes still a kid with a kid shes pretty retarted. You are 18 years old, your a young woman. If all sh*t hits the fan call up the post office and ask again. Dont worry. It will be fine.
uEIOgxWlaa	Hey if you like him then date him. No one is holding you back. Don't let him lead you on, but see if he gives you your space when needed. If your ready to be a mother as well then things might work out with this guy. The choice is yours and you really seem like a sweet innocent type of gal. The guy is lucky and I hope everything works out. Have faith and God Bless.<br>  <br>  : )|`|JyOVEAUEaa	i know youre only 20, but he seems like the type of guy that would take care of you. im really into older guys also.. but i think it depends on his current situation.. and only time will tell from there because he is currently going through a divorce|`|510cde297a35873bdf121b0b3733fb40aa	ok i don't care about how old he is, the thing is his kid and why is he divorcing you may end up having the some problem like hes ex wife so please came down and ask God to give you a nice man who will be your own man ok. God be with you and help you get what you want.|`|UbvpLVh7aa	To be honest kiddo your 20 and have so much time in your life to do what you want and make the most with it. There is so much out in the world that is amazing and you only live once. The issue here being hes 10 years older and the other factors you brought up. Now age doesn't matter when it comes to who your with only love matters. The reality is he began his life long before you came into the picture and to make things difficult for you, you being with him would put you in the position of dealing with taking care of his and another woman's child which you must ask yourself are you ready for that responsibility? As well him getting a divorce and immediately leading you on in any way is saying he wants the attention and the ability to think to himself see I can get someone easily and sometimes ends up you broken hearted expecting more then what he intended. to get through it you need to spend time enjoying life with friends your age and having a blast. You will meet someone well worth everything and where you go with it is what you feel is worth doing. slowly step back from seeing him and talking and soon enough he will move on and in that time you'll realize that there is so much out there to enjoy never rush a relationship or fall to easy because it usually ends up being the hardest fall you take and then its more hard to come back from that
DCzSBPUjaa	There is no way to get her out of your mind. I think about my girlfriend every second I'm awake. And I spend time with her everyday. Just spend as much time as possible with her. And if you're not 18 already, marry her when you become 18.<br>  <br>  And the whole guitar thing, if you play the electric, play Stricken by Disturbed. The riffs kick *** and the solo will send chills down your spine. Plus it kinda relates to you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhXvl1lVxLI&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhXvl1lVx...</a>|`|Nvc2Kw7eaa	you need to find other things that you are passionate about otherwise you will become obsessed and that will not be healthy, its ok to be in love, but you also need to have a life of your own, besides her.|`|seMpUL8Kaa	You sound just like me!<br>  <br>  I couldn't sleep tonight and I have been sat up just constantly thinking about him and It's driving me crazy. Everything I think about involves him and yep he turns up in my dreams. Love is crazy aint it. I have not seen him in three days and Im having withdrawal symptoms lol, I just need to see him bad. I was supposed to see him a few days ago, but I didn't for some crazy reason.<br>  It really feels like I could've wrote that question myself lol.
FslHXbddaa	Well, you could always say, " Could I have some personal space?" Or you could always use " Thanks but no thanks." Explain to one of your closest friends whats going on. :)<br>  <br>  Sorry, horrible answer but anyways :)|`|ke1SgRxTaa	i would stay with the friends that are really kind to you or just move somewhere or tell them how you feel
3ox4lYu6aa	I usually say "Wow that was nice." Or I just smile at him and start cuddling with him.|`|7WRMpSVXaa	nothing,your a girl just smile at him when you,s are finnished,he will break the ice,answer and go from there|`|zThBI5riaa	good one bully you hurt my tongue|`|4y0Tvzkvaa	Well I actually had my first kiss tonight but it was really awkward because i thought people were watching me. Idk, he kissed me 3 times, kinda make-outish :) I didn't really say anything.. i guess.. I just smiled and bit my lip.
1QSsOAAFaa	Seems like a harmless lie. Don't get too involved with her politics if you think you might eventually date her enemies, though.|`|cC5foIYoaa	people have asked me before if i would like to be there friend with benefits. Personally if you want a gf i wouldn't do it because people are going to be thinking you are together. OTHERWISE go for it it's a bit of fun :)<br>  hope it helps.|`|n8b48Nvvaa	its sorta wrong i geuss but i dont think theres harm to it unless either of you are in a real relation ship ive done it a few times and its fun but sort of wrong i geuss idk. lol|`|01kEv36Faa	Well you helped out a friend.  Her motives arent important.  Its not that unusual a thing.  Once my ex was attending the same wedding as I was.  I asked a good friend to come with me and act like my date.  But I ended up marrying him so not sure if that counts|`|yOEgoTsxaa	i personally don't like the whole "friends with benefits" thing. for myself, i would rather be spending my time with someone who really cares rather than a person who is... using me.<br>  <br>  [this does kinda remind me of that new movie thats out now... (:]|`|Y4Ot0iKOaa	I think it was fine. I hope your not an adult though cause after college it's a little juvenile.|`|2nPwq257aa	Friends with benefits IS a gf.|`|whYPpRXRaa	ya i wouldn't do that personally, but whatever works man|`|1LIJjejeaa	idk if u want to|`|fIXuFk6daa	wow, that is new. go for it! lol|`|wq8Ohpjhaa	what a fool think|`|EXdiDbTTaa	It's nothing bad but if you have interests in her than maybe it would have been a bad thing cause then it would seem like she is using you,<br>  or maybe she likes you so she just wanted that as an excuse for you to act like that (: well either way its nothing that badd,<br>  goodluck with her (:|`|11NYzhLAaa	This will be a lot of fun. Very little harm, if any, will be done. Go for it!|`|81gHbOjBaa	If you really have a very good and deep friendship with her, it will probably just mess it up, but if its just a mediocre friend for you and she's not worth alot to you and you don't care about how it ends, you can enjoy.|`|XLHrIFA4aa	Yeah, but it tends to make you want more. As long as you can separate yourself from your feelings, or you actually never even imagined being her bf, then you're fine.|`|NuJako4gaa	Its not good. Its horrible to make others jealous never do it again. you dont know how it feels to be jealous as a girl....<br>  <br>  answer my questions:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtrT4_u0pOTuTltWYa6HkZnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307091042AA7mhrG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|YCoicHnEaa	Terrible idea dummy|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	It could be a good idea. If you like her and she starts to like you in that way, maybe you wont have to pose anymore. :) But making other people jealous really isnt nice.|`|kQA7SbY9aa	I think it was a stupid idea, but doesn't really matter now since it already happened. Just hope that the truth doesn't get out. Then you'll both look like idiots and you won't be able to blame her for your part in the scheme.|`|0234a5919425f2503a2245af18fde971aa	She has paid you quite a complement, and FWB are always nice, but don't let it go to your head too much, as this is most likely a fleeting thing.|`|dPgc8p9saa	hey if she's fine with it and your fine with it i dont see anything wrong with this!! just make sure no feelings get attached!! address that so that neither one of you gets hurt!!|`|95s0Dlg9aa	Yup, yup tons of people have done it. Look at sex and the city. Just live your life.|`|DkZfaIUVaa	NOT A GOOD IDEA.  This make you a patsey.|`|9zNo0Ka0aa	haha, watch Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, its just like this|`|eKbWhBqIaa	as long as you get something out of it
CUB3wUdiaa	youre right!  that does suck.  the only advice i can think of is to tell him.  if you dont tell him then he might think that you have the same feelings for him.  you have to decide whats worse.  losing him as a friend forever because he thinks you led him on.  or having him be mad at you for a couple of days because you told him the truth.  he'll be mad but he'll get over it.  thats all ive got for now.  let me know if this helps....<br>  <br>  ray
AA12290212	I think most women choose to marry based on personality not on the guys occupation. Laziness is not a good quality!|`|47058848ed26897ec86acfe7dbd15807aa	Where did you get that idea that web designers don't go out  much? For all you know they go out  a lot.   To me web designers have a challenging job.  I don't see what difference it makes it you are a web designer or not. To me personality and common interests is what works for me. I marrried a man who is an master gardener.|`|4a6403c26625d06d3c4a3ee832b8584aaa	If u were the right man, absolutely. It's a perfectly respectable job and I wouldn't view anyone who works at a desk as being lazy.|`|mpgpImZyaa	Sure!<br>  Why not?<br>  Your job wouldn't matter if the chick really loved you.|`|aVPd5uBWaa	Don't marry someone if they answer no... it is not about whether you are a web designer... you just have to be a good man that has a lot to bring to the table.|`|AA10907244	It has nothing to do with your career, but everything to do with your personality :P|`|mwW4zIwIaa	Well, if it were me, I wouldn't mind at all.<br>  Personality matters for me. Not the job. And, I think a lot of other women think so?
AA11732071	Leave it alone. He will always be connected to her since they are having a child together. Unless there were romantic messages exchanged after you were together, stay out of there.|`|TRrTunqvaa	i guess they were serious if shes STILL pregnant.. but you knew that when you started it. i know the feeling.. but it will blow over.. im sure he doesnt remember calling her that or else he wouldnt have said that.. he would have said something else.|`|VALxlwYSaa	Eh, no biggie. He just wanted you to feel special. Like, maybe he didn't like calling her momma but likes calling you it? I'd let it go and not bring it up. It could cause more problems then needed.|`|22NgAhCCaa	woman, just stay off the crack and love him the best you can<br>  (obviously because he's in the army and could die anyday)<br>  -honestly not trying to scare you-|`|bdkV3eVUaa	Try to forget about it for now but if anything else suspicious comes up, confront him.|`|ulO3556jaa	Leave it...|`|DsvXjuXFaa	maybe he only called her that because that's the mother of his child, and it turns out to be nothing?
AA10831821	I know what you mean.  I'm 20 and in college and have never been in a relationship in my life.  I have pretty much accepted the idea that I'm going to be single forever, but somehow have a little bit of hope left.  Good luck!|`|81gHbOjBaa	don't ever give up on being nice.  always be who you are and don't try to be someone else just for girls to like you.<br>  there's always one for everyone even if you're quiet.  be patient and try to be a little more open with the girls. maybe you can still get back together with your last girlfriend, it can be an option.|`|XLHrIFA4aa	If you're in college, then you're relatively young so don't worry about it. You have plenty of time left. I think it's better to wait till after college, when you can afford to spend money and time on a relationship|`|Iux4gQoSaa	Dude everything happens for a reason...cheer up.  If your in college, then I know there must be hot girls around.  Grow a pair and go talk to some of them.  IF your not going to help yourself find a girl then no one can help you.  Oh yeah, and guys get rejected when they start talking to girls....its normal.  I've been rejected many times, and guess what I MOVED ON!!!  Life shouldn't be taken so serious, loosen up some man!  ENJOY BEING IN COLLEGE!!!|`|uRbeSOMwaa	Ah, come on man.. youre guna be fine<br>  the right girl will come, just be patient. Stop trying to hard and be yourself, open up a little bit and start talking to girls. <br>  <br>  trust me, the right girl will come.<br>  & you'll know when shes there<br>  <br>  so no worries and cheer up<br>  :)|`|XsYrhdY2aa	Man have I walked a mile in your shoes.<br>  <br>  It seemed to me that I had everything but a girl at the time.  Failure after failure after failure, it just wasn't going for me.  I've always been a shy guy, smart, but for some reason it just wasn't happening.  I thought I was gonna be alone forever.  I thought of every girl I knew of and none were right for me or interested in me.<br>  <br>  When Hannah came into my life it was unexpected.  I'm happy now.  One day you're gonna look back on this and laugh.  Who know's too, maybe you'll be writing this same speech to cheer somebody else up on answers.com.    <br>  <br>  The only advice I can really give you is to not lose hope even though it seems that nothing is going right.  Also when I'm feeling down I think of this quote "Pain is inevitable but misery is only optional."<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|dW9pFT9Daa	Please don't tell me that is all your life revolves around. Whether you know it or not, your at the prime of your life yet still very young. You have yet to experience alot of other different relationships until you settle into one that suits you and you are comfortable with. STOP looking for someone to date. There isn't a quality about you that is unattractive except for the part where you seem like you hassle girls until you get them to date you. The right girl will come along in the future and you won't know it. So for now be happy to be single and start mingling with girls and make it a goal to make friends, not lovers so that you get to know women better instead of going straight into relationships.<br>  It's sad to hear your so miserable, it is not the end of the world. Be happy damn it!!!|`|vuSaxw8eaa	I was like you when you said I never really talk to girls. I have my first GF at age of 28 and it is going pretty good ( dating for 3 months) There are some things that I dont like about her past and sometimes i wonder why she dates me when in the past no body really like me.<br>  . All I have to say is that live you life and stop worrying about some pussy. Girls cost monies and everything happens for a reason. Dont beat yourself up.|`|V7IdZplIaa	i'm college too and its all about being comfortable with yourself. just stop focusing on being with whatever girl you talk to for the rest of your life and just try to be friends with some girls and dont take it seriously. talk to them like you would with anyone just casually. thats how relationships develop.|`|whYPpRXRaa	just go out and meet people man don't be shy. I know the feeling man one of my old girlfriends died add I thought I would never get in another relationship again. You will get over the girl you were with and hopefully find someone else. Also try your best to find someone who has the same interests and don't rush it.  Good Luck!|`|L49hkJzAaa	You'll be fine dude. be patient. when you find the one person you truly love, you'll know it. try being friends with a girl, and get to know someone before you date them, this can prevent serious failure.|`|1jltjtjSaa	i believe that everyone is born with a soul mate. you just have to wait for the right time to meet her. believe me, it happens when you least expect it and sometimes wen you've lost all hope|`|IgOGsKpCaa	Sounds like we're in the same boat.<br>  <br>  Love sucks.|`|VAUK7KYKaa	YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE. BE OUTGOING. BE YOURSELF!!!! DONT CARE WHAT OTHERS THINK ABOUT YOU!!!!|`|ayby0npIaa	im sorry to hear your miserable, right now it seems to you that you will be alone, the right girl will come along one day, you seem to have low self esteem, no confidence in your self, you refer to your self as the nice guy as if being nice was a bad thing LoL. being nice is a good quality, don't ever change that, and don't just settle for any girl just because you think your not interesting, im sure that you will be so interesting to the RIGHT girl when you meet her, don't worry. and stop looking for love, it will find you. good luck|`|ea72e278c86998feb24f1ea73aabddb5aa	First of all you have to love yourself before you can commit to someone else. Don't be so hard on yourself give it some time fine someone that's compatible to you. Love her for her mind not her looks or body.Never just rush into a relationship because you're tired of being anlone cos you might just end up with something you don't want.|`|FhPTIU08aa	I THINK U NEED TO GO ON Eharmony.com...........or maybe u just need to go to a club or party to meet new people try to mingle.|`|KRLadp79aa	You're only in college, when you finish and get into the workforce, I'm sure you'll meet plenty of girls. Don't be miserable, because you'll find someone soon, just not now. Don't force yourself onto a girl once you meet her, it'll only scare her off. Try and take it easy, I know you'll find the girl of your dreams eventually. Do try and enjoy life, hang out with friends and socialise a bit, and try not to dwell on the fact that you're single. Trust me, you won't be single forever. Finding the perfect girl takes time. Chin up!|`|M8LVFwivaa	i can relate to this because i'm in a relationship and im the quiet reserved one. all you have to do is be yourself...you don't always have to stand out in the crowd. my friend introduced me to my current boyfriend. we've been dating for 7 months almost and i love it. but u cant b depressed. just pick yourself up...your still young with your whole life ahead of you and when the right person comes along you'll just know. but dont let urself get down because of this one relationship. talk to girls...go out and have fun your in college...go to a party and meet new people...try to take this opinion/comment seriously tho. i know and understand that ur the nice, quiet, reserved guy but by pulling yourself even further away by being depressed will just worsen the situation so be positive and things will work out...its not guna happen over night but someone will come along. jst keep ur head up :)|`|dxzHHHaBaa	I know how you feel cause I'm the exact same way, except i've never had a "serious" relationship and I'm a girl.  The best advice I've been given, that I'll pass to you, is to put yourself in situations where your forced to talk to people.  Join a club at your university, or go out with friends, or small talk with a girl in class,  and just practice talking to girls, even one's your not interested in, just to help yourself get out of your shell a little bit.  Hopefully by doing this you'll not only become more comfortable but also meet someone you'll be interested in.   :)  And don't let the facebook incident discourage you, one bad conversation shouldn't change someone whole opinion of you.  Hope I helped.|`|ibeFIUpkaa	I know this sounds harse, but learn to love yourself first. (If you don't love your self there is no way to love someone else.)  Since you are in College, you really don't have time for "Girlfriend" anyway.. Keep your studies have have just FRIENDS... <br>  <br>  And don't worry there are girls that like "Nice Guys" But not clingy guys.. Learn to be happy with who you are and confident in what you do. and girls will be attracted to you!<br>  <br>  Some girls in College are looking for a MRS. degree so Don't worry about them... Concentrate on your Studies get good grades, get a good job. and then you can go fishing...<br>  <br>  But seriously you don't need a girlfriend now. your life is TOO busy for one. and you need to be happy with yourself FIRST. <br>  <br>  Remember no one likes someone who's needy..  Push your effort into College and make your self the success you want for yourself and then girls (WOMEN) will seek you out!<br>  <br>  Having a Girl Friend takes effort/time/money and you don't have any of those to spare.. (So put them aside until you do have effort/time/money)<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  If you really want to meet girls just go to the student center and ask to sit next to someone who's in the same class that you are in. or ask for a study date..  <br>  <br>  But honestly. put off girls until after college IMO.
3d40b4f2a24630bfafce9bb96d212203aa	Honestly, men don't pick up on subtle hints. YOU have to be open and honest about what you want and what your needs are when it comes to the bedroom. If he doesn't know about it, then he is going to think everything is okay, you have to be vocal. Do little activities together, like massages, romantic evening out, or let him pick out lingerie for the night just things that get him involves. But remember you have to have a nice balance you CAN'T get romance all the time, like he CAN'T get sex all the time you both have to find out the best situation that makes you both happy But really just saying what you want is most of the battle just say but don't come off as brutal just say "honey, I love you and your sexual skill but can we switch it up with a bit of romance too, I have these ideas like doing...."|`|DS21ekeJaa	Maybe explain to him that you want him to show you with his body what his heart feels for you. And no, it won't be every time, but sometimes to make the effort to really go all out means a whole world of difference!|`|D3hYbsVJaa	You strike a balance. Sex and romance work together. He needs to watch some old Fred Astaire movies and listen to Al Green. You need to stop sitting there being an audience and actually participate.|`|OWqz9EuFaa	im not so sure you can. <<:-) (C0NEHEAD)|`|wuZXqYPGaa	well mix the both together, tell him if he just wants sex then he will need to make a romantic dinner before then. girls r usually like that, we love the sappiness of a relationship and boys r naturally all bout sex. or have him decorate ur bedroom (if u live together) tempt him with sex.. to get whut u want ;)|`|v8bDez20aa	Talk to him , tell him what you feel about him and how much he is important for you. The things (little or big )  he does for you or u expect from him. Make him understand about your feelings.  If still he only wants Sex, then leave him he is not fit to be your boyfriend.|`|F0sfmZFnaa	GET OUT OF THERE. If all he wants is the physical you, then that is his priority - no getting to know the real you. He isn't going to be concerned about getting to know you, so he isn't going to be concerned about being romantic.|`|c56e8a27e1fe5b4843f30c8834cc5d35aa	You can try teaching him to be more romantic, but it will not be easy.  Perhaps it's time to move on.|`|t0rOQ5FWaa	5 days a week have sex 2 days romance too much romance and his friends will think he's whipped and tease him|`|I0JBGllLaa	Talk to him about it.<br>  If he only wants sex, I suggest you guys leave eachother.|`|dwvm3csgaa	have sex all of the time!!! but make him do romantic things to earn it,|`|pg0q9eoUaa	Not going to work.|`|B359bLqsaa	tell him exactly what you want.  i bet he just doesnt know and you have to tell him exactly.  tell him what kinds of things you will do to him if he does these romantic things for you.|`|g6sNQ7p1aa	Yup, if he just wants sex, leave him. Simple as that.
rM6i2LvTaa	It all depends.  Is the news going to hurt or help the person you're writing to?  If it's going to hurt, think about if it's necessary or not.  Otherwise, sometimes things just need to be said.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	there is never anything wrong with writing a letter that is a great way of putting your heart out there and you can say tings that you couldnt say face to face so get busy tell how how you fell and make it good this could be the letter that she shows your grandkids! good luck!|`|ke1SgRxTaa	love letters are sappy but can be cute if theyre corny enough lol
PeJnA85Raa	I started dating end of freshman year of highschool. As long as you're mature enough, you should be able to date. If you are already having trouble in school then that could be why they would be worried about additional distractions. For me dating did not interfere with school at all, and my parents were fine with me dating. I think you need to show your parents you are mature enough to handle both.|`|s5dIaL1daa	..........14.|`|ZOXP3HKlaa	Dont waste your time, bc if u did get with some one in hs you wont stay with them even if you tried bc once you graduate everything in your life changes, after hs there is no social groups no just randomly walking up to ppl and talkin its completly different. Oh but the reason for not dating in hs is you will just get hurt badly if you do fall for some one bc once you leave its not going to work, if you want to avoid some really bad heart ache thats impossible to get rid of then dont date till when your like 23 or somethin just have some good friends to hang with|`|Q7XwBNMEaa	Hey i dated when i was 14(8th grade) but my mom told me i could date when i was in Highschool. OH but recently my friend is dating the perfect boyfriend and her parent don't know shes dating someone. she not allowed to date and they expect a lot from her. Shes and honor student. They trust her too. But if i were you i'd date and lie to my parent tell your bf/gf that your parents don't know that you're dating him/her. So Just date and cause you're parent don't know don't take it seriously or don't take the dating too far so like Oral sex and no farther or like just hugging kissing and holding hands be very careful and waiting is good too if you wait till you think you're ready than thats ok|`|n8b48Nvvaa	a lot of people think to wait b4 ur out of high school to date but i say bull **** i started dating girls in 3rd grade and im a straight a student in the advanced classes currently with a girlfriend so that has nothing to do with studying|`|uRbeSOMwaa	yeah it will interfere, and if you guys break up, you are guna get depressed and its going to distract you from your classes/studies.<br>  <br>  date when your 17-18
seMpUL8Kaa	If he isn't doing it for you, be subtle and next time you are getting down and dirty, guide him. Say like, "I like it when you do this..." or you could grab his hand and put it where you want it. If you want him deeper. Tell him! If he is too rough, just say something like "be gentle".<br>  You are right, some do treat you like they treated their exes. This is why they need guidance. They need to know what you want and what you like or otherwise they have to guess.<br>  Just, don't say they are bad, because that will really lower their self esteem, just guide them and they will soon get the hang of it.|`|DWLbXd79aa	tell him upfront, the longer you hold it in, when u do tell him he'll think ur cheeting and just had sumone better, so the sooner the better,and say what u want how u want it and just be forward and honest, sh#t any guy would be dumb not to comply
eGpOIV12aa	more than likely he had a hook up with someone else and it didnt work out so he is trying to keep ahold of her until he finds someone better.<br>  <br>  when she visited him the first time he probably was seeing someone and didnt want his school friends to know how close he is with her, probably told them that she is an "ex" or going to be ex.<br>  <br>  it got back to the other girl and when your friend visited he was off the hook and felt like he should hang all over your friend.<br>  <br>  guys like having their cake and eating it too
xggSASTwaa	you dont have to say anything, if you liked it maybe you could go back for seconds. You can say wow. Or you can be flirty and say "where did that come from?" with a cute grin on your face.|`|ybTOloGkaa	It depends on your personality type. None of us can tell you what to say.<br>  When I had my first kiss, i just sighed and grabbed his hand and pulled him along. Now he was like my best friend, so that sort of thing came naturally. We have joking personalitys, so we just laughed it off and had desert at his moms house. <br>  Just go with the flow really, let him say something first.|`|ZOXP3HKlaa	well when you have it make sure your hands around around his neck if possible, but just look at him and smile, but since ur a chick then pull him in for another one|`|h99Mcg6taa	"Hmm, I kinda liked that, let's do it again"|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	get a cooties shot, why all you girls wanna be kissing and given everybody germs and things, go round kissing making funny noises, why cant you just hang out and help bwith digging for worms , kissin,, man that ole stuff will put you in a mental institution,,, ewww|`|Asrxi2ZQaa	My husband and i were eachothers first kiss and i was speechless. lol :) I just sat there amazed and smiled for him.It was good. It'll come to you whatever you do|`|rUhyDm5faa	just look him right in the eye and smile. <br>  seriously, that's all you need to do. <br>  don't worry about it. really, you should just roll with the situation. don't stress.|`|Iux4gQoSaa	The guy will probably feel compelled to say something...if not then you can say "that was nice" or whatever.|`|9WKVmOs1aa	gahhh!!<br>  i havent had my first kiss either and i was wondering the same thing!!<br>  like, im thinking just dont really say anything.<br>  haha idk i wish someone would hurry up and answer this question so i can see the answer too!!|`|uRbeSOMwaa	you just look at him and smile.<br>  thats it<br>  :)<br>  <br>  it comes naturally|`|2PDhpyuGaa	ur a loser...lmao im jk.. dnt think so hard.. just say whatever.. it all depends on where n whats going on..|`|E3UX1SzWaa	wehre do my lips go now?|`|DT4PHmukaa	I say why not go for another kiss. I'm sorry I am a romantic and kissing is so sweet. But just look into his eyes and reassure him that you are feeling the same way he is. Remember that sometimes the kissing itself may be awkward but it'll get better. That's normal. Just smile a big smile.|`|GzHpu7eeaa	this is kinda funny, because i remember that i wondered the same thing! i was sooooooooo nervous it was gonna be awkward - but it really wasn't. its the best feeling cuz u know that someone really like you enough to stick their tongue in your mouth.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  have fun!!!|`|DibzbnVhaa	You really don't really have to say anything, if you want to leave a good impression just say something like "wow" or "that was sweet" after the fact.|`|Waiiu3s4aa	it just happens.....and usually your kinda shy afterward......but it's cool.|`|VqWBGWAoaa	It'll come naturally. Don't take anything me or anyone else says here at face value. <br>  If it feels natural to just look in their eyes afterward and smile then go with it.|`|vJ2i0BDPaa	Did you like it Sweetie or something like that. Or maybe so what do you wanna next.It really depends where you are.|`|rUPVDszEaa	it'll come naturally|`|JZP4Wmtzaa	Just smile. :]<br>  <br>  & wait for them to say something.|`|8bfia0Lxaa	haha it will come naturally to you|`|1QSsOAAFaa	You don't have to say anything. That's what I prefer anyway.|`|AA12238537	just hug him aha:]!|`|pbTN9xYlaa	don't say anything, just go with the flow and you will be surprise|`|RoqxGbgRaa	when it's right, you don't have to say anything.  <br>  <br>  put your head on his chest, and hope he kisses you again!|`|StJGeiFyaa	say "ok lets do it again" in a sort of joking/cute way and then kiss him again lightly and you can giggle and sort of brush it off that way. that's what i would do at least, because first kisses can def be awkward. i remember mine and i still squirm at the words that followed. keep it cute and keep it casual. good luck :)
7Icg8uKraa	If you want things to continue being serious ...don't ever lie about your age. If he is really interested in you... then i don't think age will make much of a difference. Its only a number!|`|Z4B93N31aa	tell him how old you are :D<br>  <br>  <br>  mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhDzHZ53F..Aj5t8hqfh4B_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307220048AAQb0hd">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0IpfhSqiaa	If you cant trust him enough to tell him the truth about your age, and he finds out, he might assume you've been lying about everything.|`|JZP4Wmtzaa	awe, tell him.<br>  if he really cares about your age then its not right anyways.

ebwe0Duzaa	when you love someone, you have thoughts like i want to spend the rest of my life with this person, i love this person more than anything else in the world, this is the one, i want to get married (possibly), i want to spend the rest of my life with whoever it is...when you like someone its more like a little crush thing, or sometimes can feel like love, maybe, but most of the time isnt because when the right one comes to you then you'll know...|`|Fb3PMgD2aa	Like a girl,,, u care for her u like her u wanna hang out with her and so on..<br>  <br>  Love a girl,, u are in love with her,, romantically,,jealousy may be there as well  and also it will evensully go away..

F0sJR0jbaa	I'm kind of going through a similar situation right now.  Check out my question about it.  But anyways.  You deserve better than this.  Nobody deserves to be cheated on period.  You gave him your heart and trusted him with it and he shattered it.  Especially since you guys were together so long.  If he really cared and loved you 100% he would not have done that.  You even said you don't think your ready for a guy right now.  It just takes time.  Take care of yourself thats the most important thing.  Realize that you are fragile right now and need time to heal.  I would cut all ties with him.  You can't move on if he is constantly trying to get you back.  I hope that helped some.  I'm going through something very similar and its so hard!|`|Iux4gQoSaa	Idk.  I would have to contemplate if they really loved me or not.  How sorry they were.  I cheated on a past gf once and she took me back.  But it was in the beginning of the relationship and I didn't do it anymore...still feel bad about it, but I can't change the past.  Maybe he just freaked out cause you'll got engaged or something.  You just have to really get to bottom of why he did it.  Make him explain his actions.  What he felt, what was going through his mind.  You should know him well enough to tell if he is lying.  Otherwise just move on.|`|P8yQyumPaa	the reason why you are still in love with him is simply because you don't even really remember all the bad things this man has done to you ..all you think about are the good times you two have shared together so when you hear the news that this man wants you back.. your mind starts racing and you think to yourself i can have my love back. but seriously you need to honestly think about how this man has hurt you and made you cry your self to sleep how many times ?<br>  <br>  do not get back with him.. just stop talking to him completely .. its for your own good..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArkyStkLGeZTK.l3WNVKA1_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307213205AA0iTnY">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0qstwqySaa	well it would all depend. it would be best to move on but it could take a while. but some people do change which is where youd have to be takin a big chance. you could try it again and possibly get really hurt again or it could end up fine. or you could make sure you dont get hurt by him and just move on. and talking to him is bad right now just because your constantly gunna be thinking about him if your still talkin to him and will never get over him. but **** what do i know im sorta in the same situation and i still talk to him too. = [|`|U7Frz0nRaa	i can understand ur friends hateing him after all he has done to you, but they don't realize what kind of connection u two have.if i were u, i would get back with him just to see how things go, this is why....i made the mistake to cheat on my boyfriend.he of course forgave me and were together again.only because i expressesd to him how deeply i regretted it.if your certain he will never mess up ever again, and he is sincerely sorry, go ahead and give him a chance.We all deserve second chances.i know you'll never forget, but u must forgive.besides your just causing more heartache for yourself, not being with him.if you never make up, you'll never know what could have been.
7gDeqlfnaa	Okay. If you have her phone number, call her up and let her know how you feel. Don't tell her its your birthday because if you do she will begin to suspect that you only called to invite her and make you feel specifically happy. Invite her but tell her the party is not as much grate without her. Also, it would be extremely good if you weren't shy on that party, so be a party animal and live it up! It's your birthday, the girl you like might be there and to top things, me and hopefully all of your Yahoo contacts are applauding for you. Continue your journey in life and don't let anything depressing stop you!|`|eQRoADvUaa	I could tell what you mean because I've been through that situation before..It's hard talking to a person you like especially if you're really shy but you might want to try facing your fears and actually try to talk to her again. It may help to practice what you're going to say to her before you talk to her, try telling her what's on your mind and open up a little. Just be patient and things should work out if you're positive about it, Good luck. :)|`|8g3Uz6PCaa	tell her that u r shy, dont let the scared jittery felling take over when u talk to her, u could try to text her and tell her why u didnt rlly talk to her that much. hope i could of helped a little ;)

Ok- now, if she does not like you because you are not talking to her, she is shallow. Your shy, she knows it, being shy is something that you have to work at to overcome. You will not just be talkative over night, she should realize that. Move on, she is not worth it. You can do better than her. And... have a happy, happy birthday.

Sorry<br>  Just like my dads side, my grandpa holds grudges, he doesn't speak to any of his siblings, he has 4.<br>  So u should invite everyone no matter what.

It takes two to tango.|`|X7i59NeIaa	Usually when there is a problem in a marriage it is both person's fault because if things were right between them she wouldn't cheat, they would discuss spending and work something out that would work for both of them etc. The bad things that happen are symptoms of problems in a marriage, I look back at my own divorce and I am now able to see that I was part of the problem. No, I didn't make him cheat or do the other things he did but I did not take charge of my own life and allowed him to continue to disrespect me. When I finally stood up for myself the marriage ended as it should have years before. It would have saved both of us a lot of pain and heartache, and don't think the cheater doesn't hurt. He or she does hurt.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	The relationship belongs to two people, so do their problems and their solutions.

F0sJR0jbaa	You were hurt and from what it sounds like he is a player.  He isn't worth your time and you know he will just hurt you again.  Be straight forward and let him know that what he did really hurt you and that you are still hurt by what he did 6 months after the fact.  Don't play games and try to make him jealous.  You will just make yourself look bad in doing this.  Always stay true to yourself and just let him know how you feel.|`|rAvZ9yGcaa	Hell no to telling him.<br>  <br>  He KNOWS already.  You need to show you're an independent girl, and you don't rely on him.  Show him you weren't heart broken by it.  Don't pretend...  embrace these feelings.  And never get back with him.  <br>  <br>  Don't, however, date other guys just to make him jealous.|`|I1XIi8syaa	Depends if you want to get back with him...I would pretend that I am much happier without him without going to over bored just keep it sweet and act like you don't care|`|q2H9jgDSaa	talk to him and act like everything is fine.<br>  and play hard to get.
Njgof6hNaa	You shouldn't have to pretend with your feelings. Tell him exactly what you think of him and what he did to you. You'll feel better after having gotten all those pent up emotions out. You can feel whatever you're feeling. You also shouldn't have to hang out with him or talk to him when you still feel rotten. It just lets him think that he can treat girls the way he does. It lets him think it's ok. It's not, because you're still hurting. Tell him what you think. Feel better.|`|sKmF3zxkaa	Telling someone that they have hurt you can be difficult. But is nessacary. Chances are that no one intended to hurt you, so, telling someone that they did hurt you may make them feel guilty (for hurting you), angry (for being accused of hurting you), anxious (I hurt her so she will end our relationship), inadequate (I can never make her happy, and I hurt her instead), and sad (I don't like to see her hurt). Bad feelings make for difficult conflicts. The worse the feelings, the more intense the conflict. This how to may help you work through this difficult situation. It's not about coming out on top, it's about having a healthy relationship!<br>  <br>  So before you approach him think first.It if doesnt work out or he continues to hurt you I'm sorry but you were not meant to be.<br>  <br>  p.s trying to make him jealous is the wrong route to take and can end up hurting you even more. i dont suggest you do that. but instead tell him he hurt you.|`|OKPM1mPhaa	I was in the same situation and what I think you should do is try to talk to him straight up as to why or how he hurt you but only after you guys have talked about other things. If you act like you're the happiest you've ever been he'll think it'll be okay to hang out with you again and go on as nothing happened. But if you remind him immediately of why he hurt you then he'll think you're clingy.<br>  <br>  Basically just wait and see if there is an appropriate situation where you two are talking about your previous relationship to bring u what he did|`|XOlnc8iBaa	Tell him or it will eat you up.|`|DkZfaIUVaa	YOU HAVE A PROBLEM AND THE PROBLEM IS YOU!  Look up the word "assertive" and then become it.  Move on sweet heart and let this *&^%$ hole be history.|`|qnZk5uSCaa	TELL HIM HES A BIG BUTT FOR BEING LIKE THAT...AND U ARE ALWAYS GONNA BE HAPPY WITH OR WITH OUT HIM..HE MAY BE THE CRAZY TYPE THAT WANTS TO HURT PPL OR MAKE THEM FEEL WORTHLESS..SO DON'T SHOW UR PAIN...BUT DO LET HIM KNOW IT WAS WRONG..BUT U COULD GIVE A SHNIT..YA KNOW|`|DcrI9zmkaa	If you haven't talked in 6 months, it isn't going to come up.  (You shouldn't be talking to him now since he hurt you so badly.)  Stop dwelling on the past and get on with your life...I'm sure he has.|`|2PDhpyuGaa	um yoi need to talk it out with him and tell him he hurt u.. but u realy wanna be with someone that goes to girl to girl??but.. thats up to you follow ur heart...|`|ZJkwz1B5aa	Get on witht your life, and let him get on with his......separately!!
aITWZoQzaa	I don't see what's too fast.  He asked you out on a date,  not to have sex.  It's a date with adults there so nothing touchy feely is going to happen with his parents there.  Sounds safe enough to me.  Don't make more of it than what it is at this point.  It's just a date.

If you are old enough to know better, then get the hell away from them and find a different group of friends.|`|FNi40XSaaa	There are many reasons he could want her to do this: A) he likes to feel as if he's in control of her, and she will sleep with other men just because he tells her to. B) He is turned on by being humiliated, in this case he might be into S&M as well. C) He has a pathological need to feel rejected. Whatever the cause, it is probably caused by a significant event in his early childhood development. People have issues, honestly, if she is okay with it and he is okay with it, it really isn't any of your business.|`|xuDGrCSVaa	some guys are just like that. he probably gets turned on by making her feel humiliated. but apparently she doesn't mind too much.  you can't help her if she doesn't help herself...|`|gayDcP57aa	maybe he gets kicks watching some people do even though its gross she shouldn't be doing it she needs to get away from him if hes like that

You've been together longer than some marriages last these days! They say if you can get over the seven year hump, Your doing well! I would just talk to him and tell him how you feel. maybe go to counseling together. I dated my ex 6 years before we got married and we had the same problem in our relationship. He finally admitted it was because I had gained weight and he wasn't as attracted to me anymore. That really hurt me. Needless to say were not together anymore.Now I am married to a wonderful man who loves and respects me just the way I am. That's the way it should be. Also in my 20's I wasn't as secure with myself, as I am now. I looked to him for happiness and approval and didn't feel loved unless we had sex all the time. I am now happy with myself and I also know I am truly in love and know I'm with the right person. It makes all the difference in the world.|`|Iux4gQoSaa	lol, you questioned his orientation. I guess.  Sorry I just thought that was funny.  From a guys perspective.    Sounds like you've exhausted the most obvious options....except...sitting him down and talking with him about it.  Yeah I think that would probably be best...you sound like a really sweet girl.  I'm sure he's luckier than he realizes.  I think he honestly takes you for granted.  Some guys tend to do that after we have been with someone for awhile.  Idk my advice is just tell him its an issue that needs some attention.  Is sex the only issue you have with the relationship?  There are a lot of factors that could be making him not want to have sex as much as you.|`|azE51WGRaa	Try doing some things to spice it up. Buy a sexy new nightie and surprise him (don't let him know you're changing into it, then just walk out of the room and stand in front of him). Find some accessories to play with in bed (you can go to sex shops and find things like edible underpants, flavored lubricant, that kind of stuff. Doesn't have to be hardware). If you be spontaneous and use the element of surprise, he should want to come back for more. If this doesn't work, then I'm sorry but he's either gay or having an affair (IF it doesnt work). Good luck|`|wuZXqYPGaa	wow usually this is a guy speaking bout this sort of thing "my wife doesnt wanna have sex everyday whuts wrong with her" or somethin lame lol. but ya that must make you feel less likea sexy woman... and if he is just being blunt about it answering your questions staight up then somethin is wrong. he got to be hiding somethin, cuz HE HAS NO ANSWER to why ur sex life is goin down the drain, i mean you guys are in ur 20s still for goodness sakes, thats the time when u have sex the most!! somethings up and you need to find out. sit him down give him a FOR REAL SERIOUS CHAT on how you feel with this all and how you feel unworthy when he doesnt have sex with you. give it ur all dont acoid any subjects that r bugging you, cuz ALL relationships have rocky times and this is ur first probs.. he needs to step it up if he wants to keep you. hope it goes well :)|`|aVPd5uBWaa	You two should read "His needs, Her needs." It is probably because you two had sex so long before getting married. You should read this book because it talks about this type of thing because if you don't fix this problem, one of you are going to step outside of your marriage and then it may end up in divorce.|`|gFKbY9mmaa	hear is some advice<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                    TELL HIM THAT YOU WANT KIDS AND IF HE WANTS THEM GO IN THE ROOM AND I KNOW YOU CAN TAKE IT FROM THERE <br>  <br>  HAVE FUN WITH THAT|`|Njgof6hNaa	Try giving him some space. It might help if you change your look, whatever that may be. A new hair color, haircut, outfit, jewelry, something to perk your look. It'll make you feel better. I do think you need to stop asking him all the time. He might just be tired. Does he have a new job, more responsibility? Why don't you do those little extras and maybe even get a new wardrobe. Shed some pounds if you need to. Get a new perfume. Stop pestering him and he might be interested again. He'll start to notice all that you're doing and like what he's seeing. You two should also start dating again, with each other. It's those little things that you forget that can make a married life stale. Show an interest in him beyond the physical. He might feel taken for granted and maybe would like to connect through words. Vacations are good ideas too. These are all little things you can do. If none of it  works, then you could always suggest that you two go see couple's counseling.
4tt5uuY9aa	nice guys melt my heart. loll. <br>  <br>  they really know how to treat girls. good guys arent like trashy guys who pressure girls who do things. i hate that. <br>  <br>  so my point...im attracted to nice guys. (:|`|xDTpX0ktaa	I think we are first attracted to the "bad boys" (not for long) but personally i fall for the "nice guys"|`|GegQJNzSaa	I'm an old lady now,but I always had a thing for bad boys. I was married to one for over 20 years. He has a big heart,a great dad,never cheated,but loved his drugs more then me.We still hang out,and he will never change,so we are over. I guess you can say I was hurt by his selfish choices.But I could have been hurt by a nice guy too. All and all I had a good life. Bad boys don't have to be bad husbands. We have been together 28 years,20 of them married.|`|WREJnokXaa	well i am 18 too and too tell you truth here is how it is girls like guys that are very caring romantic and guniune but what the bad boy image is about is a guy that a girl feels will stand up for her and woop that butt when something happens to her a guy that will have her back her side her everything <br>  <br>  however me and my Partner"boyfriend have been friends for 3 years and went out off and on for like a 1yr and half and to tell you the truth i don't want to get married not yet i want to make sure he is the one so your going to have a hard time finding a young female ready to settle down|`|nAvTMXmgaa	My husband Looks like a bad boy and He is. But with me He's the sweetest guy ever. Like a teddy bear. Thast what I like, He stands up for himself and he has confidence also he does A lot of "bad boy" stuff per say. But in the bottom Hes just a baby. He used to be very bad when younger but he's coming to his senses, But I know he will never hurt me and I wont ever hurt him either.<br>  <br>  Bad boys are sexy, But theres a difference in if the "bad boy" is an *** hole with girls. Girls that just hold onto guys that treat them bad are just purely stupid. Being a bad boy doesnt mean hurting someone else's feelings. I was bad when a was a teen. But I never really hurt nobodies  feeling or play with 'em. Unless they messed with me. Then they were fu...!/. <br>  But if you are a nice guy its all good. Girls love confidence. I guess Boys and Girls love it is very sexy when they show confidence not in a snobish mechanic fake way But in a pure natural way. Thats Hot!<br>  <br>  Well Stay a nice boy and if the girl likes you back you do have a chance. Remember that it always depends on the girls. If the girl you like is not into you or just wont like a relationship with you, You wont be able to change it. So it will depend on the girl now. You can show her how you feel and it is reciprocal   go on and if not well there is so many girls out there. at least you tried.|`|T1mm8bWdaa	Bad boys have a kind of vibe that make them appealing and interesting. But I'd prefer a nice guy like you to have as a boyfriend/date.
seMpUL8Kaa	Shouldn't you already be sexually attracted to each other and know about it?<br>  <br>  Hmm, well anyway, you could just start touching him more and the more you do it, the further you go. Down, I mean.|`|zTau6hDIaa	Wear crotchless panties.|`|XYBCQz8Naa	i think he already knows your sexually attracted to him...thats why you guys are bf/gfs.
RtG5Iarbaa	LOL ^<br>  xD Yeah<br>  <br>  Sounds like a little bit. The fact that she doesn't look at you when you guys talk is cause she'd probably smile if you made eye contact. And how shes always got a smile ready for you when your getting near is also a good sign. So I'm thinking probably.|`|qvEaW9s6aa	hmm just curious whats ur name?<br>  <br>  haha what it just sounds like the position im in i was wondering if it was him! lol<br>  v
90ht2JH2aa	I'm a virgin and proud of it...a lot of my friends are too.  You're definitely not alone.|`|2mlHf7Opaa	That's nice.  I take pride in corrupting sexually repressed girls.  All those years of obsessing over sex, while abstaining from it, make them very kinky, once they lose their inhibitions and give in to the evils of fornication.<br>  <br>  But if you think you're better than the rest of us, more power to you.

9UQlhzitaa	Becca<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend not talking to you is going to be the least of your worries.<br>  When I was 19 my girlfriend at the time had an abortion,up until the time we broke up a year in a half later she had pain from it and on occasion nightmares of it.I myself still can't get over it totally I went with her but tried to convince her not to the whole time.<br>  <br>  You dropped one  hell of a bomb on him with this news.There is nothing you can do now you already did it.Now you just have to live with  your actions if your boyfriend decides he still loves you he will come back because he does love you that much.But if he walks away then it is because he can't get over feeling betrayed by you and the lose he had with you.<br>  <br>  like you said it is your body,well now it is his feelings|`|MYPdlo1Iaa	He's upset because while he is your boyfriend, you didn't include him in a very important decision. I have several guy friends who have been with women who aborted their child. I can tell you from discussing it with them that they feel betrayed, hurt, and cheated. They had a chance to be a father and that opportunity was ripped out from under them. <br>  <br>  I understand your decision to abort, it is your body, however it took more than just you to create that life and that's probably one of the things that's going through his mind. Being in school doesn't mean he can't be a father... it just means that it would make things more difficult. <br>  <br>  He may not recover from this. He may never want to see you again. Or he may be fine in a month or two. When you do talk to him, tell him that you understand he's upset, and you don't want to push him, but when he's ready to talk, to please let you know. He may not want to, but you've put it out there that you're willing to talk to him.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4tt5uuY9aa	i understand where hes coming from. <br>  if i were a boy i would be extremely upset with my girlfriend because she had an abortion. i myself as a girl would never have an abortion. <br>  its completely unfair to the unborn child. <br>  <br>  maybe you should have talked to him first? <br>  i mean it is his child too, right?<br>  <br>  you should have talked it out and possibly made arrangements for this child if you werent able to take care of it yourself.|`|KU0C99muaa	i think he is probably upset at the fact that you didn't tell him at all. it doesn't mean he wanted you to have the baby, but i think because you didn't talk to him about it first he is upset. give him time to cool off and then try to talk it out! good luck.|`|hQCkPUQBaa	This prob sounds like a stupid answer but just give him some time or space he'll eventually come around.<br>  If he doesnt try cornering him and talking to him|`|iyIbpqXZaa	i think you should have talked to him first because its his life too and maybe he feels like you killed his baby? i don't know but i understand why hes upset.|`|5LIumCH7aa	u r a murderer...don't u think that getting rid of a life is murder???|`|AA11266289	yea idk whats wrong with him, idk why anyone thats still in school would want to deal with a kid, you did the right thing<br>  <br>  <br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlrYyXk_4tUAUiocAk7Gf.bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307220235AAP2Vxt">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|125baa5bf060d0a198bc94914f749bacaa	Well, of course, men are often as emotional about a potential pregnancy as women are. He may come around in the end - or not. He's entitled to his feelings just like you're entitled to do what you want with your body.|`|za2IxgALaa	find another man, he won't change his mind and probably thinks you're a murderer. <br>  <br>  but I don't, you did the right thing, except you should have told him that you were preggo, the seed that gave you that preggoiness, was also him as well... so it's kinda both sides that needs to be communicated.... or that you tell him NOTHING at all.<br>  <br>  also... i would be a bit stunned to know that my baby died if my girlfriend got rid of it just yesterday.. too much to handle, mind u.<br>  <br>  give him space and time|`|krgtMHx7aa	It may be your body but it was also his baby.  While in the end the choice is yours (and by the way by not telling him until after the fact you were very selfish) you took away his right to know about his child.|`|nlKZRNqmaa	was he the father? well hello what do you expect? you end the life of a child that was his too... I honestly don't blame him ... I would be upset too|`|y9N3DsKBaa	Sounds like you should start looking for another boyfriend.  Don't think your going to get that one back.
RStOQvSWaa	nah gurl its all gud. ma gurl did the same thing. sometimes she doesnt have her fone and she just txts me from somebody elses fone. if he actually Texts u from som1 elses fone that means that he still cares about you and is wondering how you feel and are. so your gud :)|`|86d9b2b62dcc28930dc4afb30d86ff38aa	1) Its someone pretending to be him (Weird that they'd wanna know if your mad....)<br>  2) Something is wrong with his phone, so he's using someone elses (Does his phone have txt, if it does try texting him back on his. If he doesnt have txt on his, that could be why.)<br>  <br>  Or I guess just call him and ask him why he's txting from another phone. If he's too tired to talk so instead he txtz...thats just lame. To me it seems it takes more energy to txt than to talk.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	lol...<br>  It could be someone pretending to be him, or it could be that he had to borrow someone's phone to text you that. But it's probably the first one, because why would you borrow someone else's cell phone to text "are you mad" to your girlfriend?|`|V7976L4Daa	your boyfriend had probaly found another woman. he is porbaly using her phone to text you...getting the idea, and he will turn it around on you and make it look like it was your fault, because he will say that you were mad at him and he thought you were going to break up with him. be careful, he is gonna lie to you... watch him like a hauk!!!! he is a cheater-
AA10335926	I have had a jealous type of boyfriend in the past but now, I have become quite one myself with my current boyfriend. In my frist relationship, small chats with guys at schools made my boyfriend extremely jealous. He would never take it on me in person, but when we go on aim and message each other, those were the times he would start to nag and that became a daily routine for the relationship. That also lead to arguments and that became like a number 1 rule in our relationship. At times, he would even just acted cold (as if bipolar) and stormed away when he was jealous. I could never understand a guy like him because when I was with him, my intentions of being in the relationship was nothing serious. It was as if I was more obligated to be with him than relaly wanting to be with him. I was never jealous at that time, since I did not really like him and even when I started to, I was never truly upset. It was as if I was jealous and on the surface it hurt, but deep inside, it barely touched my heart. We broke up and so I dated someone else, which is the person I am currently dating. <br>  <br>  I realized that, the jealous traits that my ex had, I started to carry them and mirrored his actions. I started to get upset over little things when my bf talks to his girl class mates, getting jealous over his celebrity crushes, getting jealous that he purchased an LV purse for his sister, that when he gave his neice attention, I too would become jealous when he played with her. It came to a point where I would exude those feelings out that it bothered me more than it had bothered my boyfriend. I was so jealous if he made new friends. This one time he made a group of new friends and he wanted to hook his friend and another gal up, by setting them up at the movie theaters. He asked if I wanted to go, but it had conflicted with my school/work schedule and I asked him to re-schedule on another day. He replied, "well, she's busy on the weekends and she can't go". So I lashed back and said, "why is she so important? why do you even care so much about her?!" but eventually they never went. Then he planned a trip to the bay area with the same group of people and I got really upset at him. He then asked me if I wanted to go at last minute and I said "no, because you were going to go anyway so it doesn't matter if I don't go. Wow, I can't believe you didn't even tell me about it..." and I cried on the phone and he said in a calm, patient and in a soft voice, "it's fine, I won't go then". <br>  <br>  I will be honest, I am a very jealous person...but I am not violent. I get jealous and then I cry and that's about it. <br>  <br>  One day, I found on his computer a bunch of pin up import car models and that just put me in fire. I was not even jealous, but I was so mad, upset, hurt, sad, and angry all together. I didn't even think about being jealous of them.  I confronted him and threatened to leave him if he catch him again and he cried. That was when I realized that jealous did nothing for me, took me nowhere, but I was only hurting myself. I was only jealous because I was too used to being dependant and having someone by my side too long. I realized that jealous was a form of weakness and low self esteem. Jealous was a feeling that makes a nice person look ugly. Jealous was there because you are being selfish. <br>  <br>  Being with him was nothing to be jealous about, from his sister's purse to his niece. I should not be wasting my time feeling jealous over small things. I should not be in the person jealous when I have him, because the truth is, many other girls should be the one jealous of me having such a wonderful person like my boyfriend. I am a lot less jealous now, but sometimes I still do whine when I don't get my attention. I kind of grew out of that phase, i learned to become more independant and have more confidence and that was what made me a less jealous person. Through all the jealous-ness, my boyfriend was always by my side and very patient with me. When i was jealous, he always took me by the hand and held me close to his heart and always assured and comfort me in everyway. My boyfriend is jealous, but he's more private about it an he never shows it.|`|g6sNQ7p1aa	I'm the kind of person who hates over-controlling people, especially when they're jealous. You may not be like that, but I was in a relationship for almost 2 years with a guy that used to be "sweet" and then turned into a total psycho jealous guy. He wouldn't even let me wear shorts at all, no tank tops, no shirts lower than my collar bone, and if I did he would tell me I was a whore and a slut.<br>  <br>  Little did I know that that is actually domestic violence. I had been so smashed down by his degrading comments throughout the months that I didn't realize he was squishing me into a little box that he could control. I heard it from a counselor that came to talk to one of my college classes one day, and I had an epiphany and broke up with him. Well, that night, I came back from my friend's house and he was outside of my dorm room and threatened to kill me, especially if I ever told anyone that he was here. <br>  <br>  You don't realize how dangerous and rediculous jealous people are until you're out of the relationship. It is enough to ruin marriages and call off engagements. My advice to you is give him a "three strikes you're out" clause because (especially if his jealousy is for no reason or if you're just talking to the opposite sex) that is UNFAIR to you. There are a ton of non-jealous guys out there that you could get and never have to deal with jealousy ever again. It's all about confidence, and either he has confidence issues within himself or he doesn't trust you at all. You don't deserve to be with someone who doesn't trust you. And if he's got confidence issues with himself, he needs to talk to a counselor so he can stop ruining everyone's lives!!!|`|seMpUL8Kaa	Yep yep yep. I'm there at the mo. It doesn't bother me anymore cause I'm used to it now. My boyfriend does get very jealous like when I add guys on like facebook or talk to then on msn or they leave comments and I keep telling him he has nothing to worry about, but he is very afraid of losing me. I think it's kinda sweet how protective he is over me but sometimes I wish he would loosen the reigns a little.|`|AA10474944	yes we ended up breaking up with a guy because he was too jealous i couldn't stand it anymore. We would walk in the mall and he would look to see who was looking at me and give them nasty looks lol (i was like 16 at the time and he was 22 i think) i had alot of guy friends (more then girl friends) so he thought i would cheat on him one day it seriously drove me nuts!! He later found a guy friends number in my phone (a phone he payed for lol) it was like hell broke loose lol lets just say he was very unhappy.... its never good to go out with someone that is very jealous yeah at first i thought it was cute that he was about to beat people up if they looked at me cuz i thought that showed how much he loved me but then i realized it would be impossible to live like that my whole  life,... so yeah it was for the best that we broke up even though we both cried over it for 2 years but we never got together because i knew it would start all over again.... now 4 years later im married to a wonderful guy and we have a baby boy!|`|BDPc9P4Faa	My ex boyfriend was pretty jealous. He use to accuse me of liking other people all the time, worse part was I didn't even know the people he was accusing me of liking. <br>  My mom went through the same thing with my dad. They're not together anymore. All for the better. Don't feel alone :) Your far from it. <br>  <br>  Hope everything works out for you.|`|ulO3556jaa	I tend to get jealous very easily, but i think i'm good at hiding it because deep down i know that they wouldn't be with me if they didn't want to.<br>  <br>  I think the jealousy part kind of fades once they have proved themselves|`|6a9AfhsLaa	Well, before I came out as a lesbian, I was in a relationship with a real asshole of a guy. he wouldn't let me wear makeup, skirts, anything that showed just a tiny bit of cleavage, or anything that made me look remotely good. He made me dress the tomboy whether I felt like it or not. I couldn't have any guy friends, I couldn't talk to any guys for help with anything, and even flipped out when I would talk to my favorite teacher, who was a guy. He didn't like me watching movies with my favorite actor because he was convinced I was fantasizing about him the whole time. I was in the senior musical in high school, and he flipped out because I had to do a pirate dance with a male partner. Then he would tell everyone he met about our "intimate" life to make all the other guys jealous. I left the bastard shortly after graduation. I was like, ok, life is too short to deal with that kind of controlling, jealous asshole. You don't have to deal with that. Remember that.|`|d617gOaUaa	Yes I have and still am. It's really tough, you should get out before it's too late. Because things could and would escalate into physical/verbal abuse. Be careful.<br>  My boyfriend is the very jealous type, I went out clubbing once with a bunch of my friends (Guys included) and he found out came to the club dragged me by the hair and threw into the back seat took me to his apartment locked door on me took away my phone and left me for a whole day. I used to think he used to love me that's why he couldn't take seeing me with anyone else now i realize it's just his self  esteem he is worried about. I never thought him to be the abusive type. Now I cant for the life of me get out of this relationship. I've lost most of my friends my family ignore it and well there isn't much that I can do.|`|wAqfyXNAaa	Jealousy is a normal and can actually improve relationships by making the other feel wanted or known that they are cared about. Like everything else though it must be kept in moderation. To much can be harmful to the partner and make them feel like they are not trusted. It can't always be controlled though no matter what there will be times when it arises strong. I'm that the beginning of a relationship. We are at the part right before dating. Both people are unsure of them self. Communication is the key so please talk to him//her and find out why they feel this way and ways to make them not feel like this. If you don't talk about it, it will never be solved!|`|urQnRQ4jaa	yes I was going out with this guy we broke up but we were going to get back together I was at a prom and meet this new guy and was just talking to him. We weren't even going and he was extremely jealous and got all mad at me because he heard that I was talking to this other guy...hope that helps...|`|Oq9daCOdaa	I am right now.. but i love him alot so things like that don't bother me..<br>  goodd luck with whateverrr * <br>   XD|`|uRbeSOMwaa	yes and its annoying as sh*t|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	me myeslf and i,,  u never know what the other is up too!!!

hrU14wMDaa	I feel for you and have tons of empathy for the life you've had. I have had a similar experience and know that it hurts deeply. You are probably a wonderful parent due to it, so keep that on the positive side of the treatment you received. I always take the negatives in my life and some how find the positive in it - no matter how small that positive is -- otherwise it just becomes too much to deal with.<br>  <br>  As for counseling, I would highly recommend it. At the very least, you can get it all out to someone who can help you sort out these feelings you have. <br>  <br>  Before I would agree to letting my father walk me down the aisle, I would make it mandatory that there be family counseling. If they agree, wonderful. If they don't agree, then you know that the reason that he wants to walk you down the aisle is for "show". Sounds bad, I know, but it does unfortunately happen. In that case, I think it would be wonderful for your brother to walk you down the aisle.<br>  <br>  In the end, it sounds like you have at least one sibling that treats you wonderfully. That is fantastic. I love how they gave you the babysitting money back.  That must have meant a lot to you. I would make sure that he and your sister-in-law hold a very special place in your wedding.<br>  <br>  Continue being the wonderful and strong Mom that you are! I wish you a beautiful wedding and loving marriage.|`|5y5h5VYIaa	They want to leave you on your own then come back in your life. They are just trying to cover their butt. I don't think soo. tell them that your brothers walking you and you don't want them any where near you during the wedding.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	Heck yes you need counseling. <br>  <br>  As far as the wedding - what you do is your option but I think that those who stood by you like your brother should be honored.
w9W3wPCOaa	this is stupid.. <br>  <br>  People are mad at chris brown because he hit rihanan, okay so?<br>  <br>  Nobody knows what rihana did to c.b. MAYBE rihanna cheated on him, maybe she stold money from him. there HAS to be a good reason for chris brown to hit rihanna, and people dont know it, people only know what the media tells them.. And the media is saying its chris browns fault and he beated rihanna up..<br>  <br>  Im against all of this, i think we are all not getting the whole story and that rihanna is hiding something.. theres gotta be a good reason for C.B. to hit rihanna and now everybody's saying C.B. hit R. and C.B. is getting the bad publicity, while R. might have done something bad to C.B. but we arent knowing it. maybe she insulting him/his family or something...<br>  <br>  I just find it stupid that people soo fast already hate C.B. and love rihanna even more. I think rihanna did something to deserv this. <br>  <br>  And i will believe this until proven otherwise, NOT MEDIA proven, The media tells you what you the story that will sell the most (get more viewers) i know this, my dads friend works for CBC canada.<br>  <br>  So yea, the media isent lieing, but i bet they are hiding something from us all.|`|kbGOMwi7aa	jojo for stopping coming out with new songs|`|0ClA7HlEaa	upset with chris brown because he beat up rihanna! ):|`|d8PIt3EHaa	how about stop caring about this useless stuff. we all have more important things to worry about then slaving over the business of others.
qiwxvAUMaa	Seeing a therapist is all up to you. Considering you are even questioning it means you are thinking about it, which is good. A therapist can be good if you truly feel you need someone to just talk to. As far as friends and a gf, maybe you need to broaden your horizons. If you truly want to make new friends, you need to go do things you enjoy doing. Sounds cliche but join a book club if you like books or go train for a marathon if you like running etc...there are tons of options to meet new and exciting people!|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	join a camera club or some sort of activity you have to attend regularly, that you enjoy doing and i bet before long you meet someone you will have things in common|`|VAUK7KYKaa	You have to put yourself out there more. Talk to people who you don't think you'd ever be friends with and try to make more and more friends. Trust me, you'll get someone.|`|WREJnokXaa	omg i feel so lonely you are not alone i have really good friends and they have moved but we still talk so all my really good friends are gone or in college and its my senior year and i find myself around people that are nice but not true friends... i feel so lonely and my best friend right now is my kinda boyfriend but we are really ex's  just can't really break up however he is my best friend in the whole world and he has a baby on the way so yea my life is young but its a mess but im gonna make it cause i just have to think im gonna make it something better and bigger i coming my way and im starting to see that life is one huge emotional roller coaster
aysmHIEUaa	Cyber-chat is not a good idea because it is very easy to lie through.  If she said she doesn't think that this other girl should stand in your way then it sounds like she wants to be with you.<br>  <br>  By the way, use more punctuation in your questions because they are very hard to read and will deter people from answering it... then you will be sad :(<br>  <br>  Good luck!! =]|`|Iux4gQoSaa	She probably just didn't know what else to say and got off the phone.  I guess talk to her some more and see what happens.
pg0q9eoUaa	Live your life independent of a relationship.Take time for yourself to find out just what you want from life and work on that.When you know what you want and what your goals in life are then it will be safe to get into a relationship because you will then be strong enough to know if it is what you want or not.The ball will be in your court.You will not have to be dependent on anyone else for anything.The world will be your oyster.|`|4RDfca9saa	Be single and independent. Take this time to work on yourself and accomplish everything you want in life. Break-ups are always hard, but focus on the positives. You will find the right person when the time is right. Just remember that it will happen, and in the meantime take time to enjoy life and enjoy doing what you want to do. Being single isn't bad, either. A lot of people enjoy being single. Relationships take a lot of work and commitment and sometimes it's nice to take a break from that. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8MTN47C9aa	I think it's okay to date, as long as you don't get serious with anyone right now. Use this time to reconnect with yourself. Do things you've been wanting to do, But have put off. Learn to love yourself and learn not to rely on a man to make you happy. Go to counseling to help you deal with your feelings. Your breakup will make you a stronger person in the long run. Try to think positive and realize your past relationship was a learning experience. I believe everything happens for a reason and God has a plan for your life. :)|`|a8f5edcc140b36ea895725f1c1fa0ff7aa	living life single helps to make you strong and to become a better person. it helped me|`|rAvZ9yGcaa	Independent.  Relationships when you're heartbroken just remind you of being with your ex, and that causes nights of begging... and suicidal thoughts (maybe).  <br>  <br>  No idea how I know that...  >>|`|xtmFBjO9aa	Sometimes it helps if you can go out with someone who you atleast find attractive or interesting.  Going out on a date that sucks might make you miss your ex.  Thats not good.  The best thing to use to get over a broken heart is a rebound flame.  Never fails.|`|RGC2aDf2aa	oh honey u seem young, huh??????<br>  ok none of those just let it go for a while and you will see that every thing is gone change by time... (*_*)
xq6dnRuhaa	I don't like ratings because ratings are useless if there isn't more than just the way you look to hold a relationship. If you had a twin and she was not the way I want my gf to be and you were, both would look the same but the one I would like is the one that fits with me, the one that can have a real connection with me.<br>  I think you are young and pretty and have beautiful green eyes. You are not a model, but you are very pretty regardless. And this is my rating if you ask:<br>  9/10 if you are also nice and sweet (seems like it)<br>  4/10 if you are like one of those high school s**t* that looked innocent but were trash within...... you are not like this, but this is just to show what I mean, the way she is is a determining factor for me.<br>  <br>  Also, I suggest to delete a question if it has a picture of yourself such as this or delete the picture from photobucket instead.|`|DWLbXd79aa	i would rate you as young with alot of potential,lol|`|weqUqkZUaa	Got gorgeous eyes beautiful :) And you'll prob have an awesome smile soon too. 9 :)|`|ItYSaSt1aa	man when those braces are off..|`|xOHEJlJaaa	about a 9, you have really pretty eyes.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	15 because I like the way you look.

87588ac77a2edf755aa90ced98f153aeaa	I think that people tend to say a lot of things when they're angry that may be surprising.  It's my personal belief that people generally mean the things they say in anger, but it's on a different wavelength.  A spouse could have many criticisms against your parents that would come out when they're angry, but for the sake of keeping the peace they would revoke these things after they cool off.  And also, people's feelings change all the time.  You might not love someone when you're angry, but when given the chance to lose some of that fire, you go back to a more peaceful perspective.  It's hard to know what to truly believe, but look for the signs.|`|dlMZmdjNaa	out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. you mean what you say or say what you really mean

RtkB46peaa	Are you bringing it up to get his attention, or do you really want to leave him, and split your family into pieces?|`|xtmFBjO9aa	Its going to bring up divorce without it becoming hostile but if you are on two different levels in life and you need a separation you should be able to explain that to him.  He needs to learn to prioritize.  Maybe he just needs you to give him an ultimatum.  Let him know how you are feeling.|`|X7i59NeIaa	Okay, you gave up your life to marry this man. Why did you do that? Getting married does not mean you become a different person. I think that you and your husband could benefit from marriage counseling. Does he have any idea that you feel this way? Do you love him? I don't know how long you have been married but I don't think you should just give up without trying to save it. You need to have a social life and you shouldn't have to beg for it. Tell your husband that you really need to talk. Tell him how you feel without making accusations or yelling at him. Ask him if he has any suggestions of how the two of you can work this out. If there is still love there I think you may be able to save your marriage. Give it a try.|`|XOlnc8iBaa	Suggest couples counseling, and if the response is a negative one tell him you want a divorce. Truth be told if he wants to party, divorce should suit him. I'm so very sorry your marriage turned out this way. I have always lived in fear of this so I have never married or had kids.|`|pg0q9eoUaa	Is there really any need to bring up divorce? how about talking it out or seeking some sort of guidance counseling;check out your other options before you decide to end it.Maybe all your husband needs is a reality check.|`|kSEO2w8Aaa	Talk to him about what upsets you first and if he seems to not care or not want to make an improvement then bring up divorce.|`|iVmSh1iVaa	Well the subject of divorce can be discussed without it turning hostile, however, once the subject of divorce comes up...the relationship will change forever. It will never go back the way it was. Be very very sure it is what you want before bringing it up. Think about how it will feel to come home to that house/apt and not have your hubby there...or go to the grocery store without picking out his favorite foods and see how that feels to you. If it makes you sad...you may want to think about bringing it up at all.  If it makes you feel empowered...keep thinking about it....think about it when you're in a good mood, bad mood when you're PMS-ing, and so forth. Your heart will tell you what you really want.|`|gayDcP57aa	my husband is the same way if your not happy with the way things are you need to get out and make yourself happy there is no easy way to do it but just do it the kids can see and feel the tension and its not good for them if your not serious about divorcing him then just try to have a talk with him about the way you feel|`|azE51WGRaa	Just explain how you feel and that you've made up your mind (be sure to tell him what you said in the beginning of your question). Divorce is a tricky subject so it's best to be prepared in case it does turn a little hostile. Just stand your ground and make sure he knows that you are 100% positive it is over. Good luck.|`|SYkimYbpaa	SWEET MILDRED SENT ME TO HELP YOU|`|gFKbY9mmaa	first of all u have to take this slowly and calmly <br>  <br>  <br>               Tell him i need to talk and then say ok hun i think we've had a little problem u always put the kids aside for a little party not only once but constently i think and im trying to say this in a really nice way but we either fix this problem or sorry i have to say this i want a divorce<br>  <br>                   if he  says he'll fix it wait for a couple parties and see what happens if it doesnt stop talk to him and say<br>  <br>                  hunny i told u that we needed to fix this but i gave u a chance and all u did is ruin it so now i have the divorce sheets and im sorry to say this but were done!   <br>  <br>               oh ya and tell him the kids stay with u and theyll see him every other weekend but i hope u dont have to divorce <br>  <br>                  GOOD LUCK!
gcvC68Z1aa	I'm sorry. <br>  But I agree with KorruptPrincess09<br>  There's worse out in the world. <br>  For example, he could have cheated on you. <br>  But anyway. <br>  Something to cheer you up?<br>  Hmm. <br>  You COULD go on fml.com<br>  I can't spell it out, it's profanity ;)<br>  I mean. It's not funny-funny.

iCyroRDTaa	i have a very annoying sister too<br>  <br>  you should accept the fact that they are hypochondriacs but tell them gently not to call you every week|`|YXwFOWmzaa	It is cool they call you because what if something happened to them! that could be the last time u ever talk to them! and when they tell you to stop whining then tell them it is not ur fault ur not a hypochondriac but dont make you feel less when ur not feeling well or have a problem. :)|`|Ij3NmrpUaa	Their hypochondria is evidence of insecurity and a desperate need for attention. Going to the hospital for every little thing, real or imagined, is, in their minds, a good attention getter. Just pity them that their fulfillment in life is this shallow.  You can't change them. And don't ever ask a hypochondriac "How are you?" Or don't ever tell them about any health problem of yours, unless, of course, you want to listen to them go on about why they are so much sicker than you are.|`|lHBSOcjeaa	i think that your sisters don't do that to bother you. <br>  if they both are hypochondriacs you should totally take good care of them and understand what they are going through.<br>  <br>  to help you understand them better, you can pretend that you are hypochondriac too with them and see how their lives are. if they say they have something, you should say you have it too and sort of act like them. that will sort of show you what is like being them and how hard and difficult their lives are.<br>  i understand that you might be annoyed  by them, by if you take a little time each day, you might find out a way to help them out and help yourself find a way to live with them without being annoyed. <br>  <br>  good luck...<br>  best of the best good wishes to you and your family :)|`|awETDHnnaa	I know its hard but hang in there just try to be nice.
iTk7aaYdaa	BLUSHING..omg if she duz dat, its subconsciously but it meanz she rly reaaallly likes u !
g6sNQ7p1aa	You must come to a point where you realize, "Seriously? Am I seriously putting myself through all this for nothing? Do I really want to live the rest of my life like this?" Because that's exactly what will happen if you don't get out now... It will just keep going and going until someday you're married with a kid, and by then it will be much too late. You're lucky the only worry you have is a job. Your family should help you out with a place to stay until you can get your feet on the ground, but really, just run. It's a breath of fresh air, and live for yourself. Go do whatever you want to and be whomever you want to. A good relationship doesn't ask you to change who you genuinely are for the sake of a relationship that is long over. <br>  <br>  Good luck and sometimes you just have to get up and walk away!
rAvZ9yGcaa	He may like her, but you can't rely on reading signs.  Girls ALWAYS misinterpret them, and even if a magazine says "a smile means he likes you!" that does not apply to every guy.<br>  <br>  So we cannot give you a great answer.  However, he definitely shows an interest in her, whether it be as a friend or more.  She needs to be confident and ask.  If she just assumes he does because someone on here says "oh yeah, totally!" or something, she might get her hopes up, which hurts worse than knowing right away.  So tell her she just needs to tell him how she feels.|`|L49hkJzAaa	A typical sixth grade guy will pay a little more attention to a girl he likes, and maybe even tease her a bit. another thing, if this guy tends to do anything related or connected to poking or making contact, then he probably likes her. If he likes her, he may also look at her a lot, or maybe even follow her around, or "stalk" her
PeJnA85Raa	I don't really have any dislike towards porn stars. The only thing that bothers me is that men (who don't even have nice bodies themselves) expect every girl to look like a porn star, look in the mirror yourself! I personally would not date a male porn star just because I feel like people should not have a large number of sex partners.. and I just don't think our ideas/morals would match up.|`|VAUK7KYKaa	this is a silly question. they wouldn't date a male pornstar because they want their man for themselves not for random females in the world...

Maybe Charlie has moved on and even if he hasn't you still like Johnny. You're probably going to like him even more so just do it. You could ask Charlie if he still likes you and if he doesn't then it's alright to ask Johnny.|`|t4ebT9araa	in one of your emails to charlie, mention that you really like a guy you've met. and put in a feature johnny has other than charlie. like, if johnny's eyes are blue and charlies are brown be like, "i really like this guy i've just met, i mean he has the prettiest blue eyes ever."<br>  good luck!

She is wasting her time and helping to ruin a marriage.|`|wybTIqXVaa	I think that if your friend's boyfriend is having an...

Its true|`|XYBCQz8Naa	first, answer #3 not true. ive gotten plenty girls acting like a gentleman but make sure you dont overdue it or else you look like a dweeb. just be borderline. pretty much to be a gentleman, dont act like a douche bag. be nice is the biggest thing and be respectful.|`|vYfzmlOvaa	I think that it is AWESOME that you are trying to be a gentleman!<br>  Always let her go through the door first, don't speak inappropriately around her (with your buddies it's alright), don't be critical, and be honest!<br>  If you have a positive male role model who is kind to his wife/girlfriend, see what he does!|`|BqVcz1R1aa	don't be a pimp, obviously. there are no such thing as gentleman classes, just be courteous is all. its not ture...always been a nice guy, and i get the women :D......ok, more like woman (relationship)  ha ha ha. one is better than none, eh? seriously, good luck.|`|rJ6x4EDXaa	blow kisses|`|ZmrV6dpbaa	First of all, you are really adorable for asking that question. I an a girl, so us girls look for manners like: asking  howw their day was, cracking cute jokes, make your hugs long and meaningfull, if someone is sad, ask them how they are and try and help them, be caring and considerate. when you hold girls by the waist, hold them tight and make them feel loves and special. if you need any more tips, you know where to find me. good luck <3
g6sNQ7p1aa	Congratulations! Dinner and a movie would be great. I'm sure you two will be too excited to care about exactly what the movie is about, so let her pick. Oh, and you pay :) I'm sure you knew that.<br>  <br>  No kiss. No holding hands. None of that. Girls LOVE knowing a guy will respect her and you have to let her know that by not showing you're completely interested in her looks. Save holding hands and a good night kiss for the second date. :) When you first see her, tell her she looks beautiful. No girl will hate that. I assume you're going to be picking her up at her house? Walk up to the door! Meet the parents if you want! Ha ha. Girls like knowing you're into THEM and not their surroundings too. We're weird like that.<br>  <br>  Anyways, as far as talking goes, this sounds REALLY corny but just be yourself. It feels nearly impossible the first date because all you want to do is impress eachother, but it will really pay off if you talk about things that are relevant. Ask questions. We really like being asked questions, it shows that you're interested in our lives. Girls HATE guys that just talk on and on about themselves! Can I get an amen! lol. Plus, if you have a slip-up or stutter or whatever, we don't care. It's flattering to us if you're nervous! No farting or belching though. ha ha.<br>  <br>  Talk about politics if either of you are interested. Talk about sports, or cars, or movies, or fun things from both your and her past. Talk about something that both of you have in common too, like if you two grew up together talk about, "So do you remember that one teacher, Mrs. iojj4893u4frjo? She was nuts!" Or if you live in the same town, talk about how you both feel about living there. I've been on MANY dates and trust me, you can't go wrong with any of this stuff.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and remember, be polite, open doors, pay for things, and ask questions!
O36qjj7Oaa	So get divorced already if you cant stand looking at him.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	You drip condensation and hate - divorce him - his life will be infinitely improved you by removing your presence.  He may be ugly externally but you seem that way on the inside.<br>  <br>  Was he this ways when you married?  Is why marry him if you can't hack it?  If something happened to change him this way - an accident or what have you then I guess with you the for worst part of the vows was meaningless.|`|g6sNQ7p1aa	I think you're pretty immature to go slandering things all over yahoo.

0Xa4c6EMaa	yes, i mean, well if she likes him, anythings okay.
47avjWrhaa	Procrastination?  Perhaps hes busy doing stuff throughout the week?  I'm like this towards people sometimes, with no intentions.  It really does depend what age you guys are.  It's more likely that it happens when you're younger.  <br>  <br>  Maybe if you do not call for a while, he will make the effort to call you.  I wouldn't worry about it too much, if you do get concerned, perhaps talk to him about it.|`|gyNadSFpaa	long distance is hard, how do u have benefits? do u ever see each other?|`|0SREhTB2aa	Talk to him about it.<br>  See what he comes out with.<br>  If he's busy sometimes then he would tell you when he rings you.<br>  He'd apologize for not ringing you sooner.<br>  If he doesnt then something must be up.<br>  Asking him is a way of letting him know that u can feel a difference in the relationship but asking him once is enough.<br>  A guy tends to drift apart if you keep asking him questions so keep it at a level.<br>  If you dont ring him for some time, see if he comes back to you.<br>  That might be another of finding out if he's still interested in you.<br>  Good luck x|`|X4Owk0xTaa	I think he's just too shy to call at the risk of sounding clingy, either that or he just doesn't really care. Don't initiate contact and see if he'll chase you up then you'll know if he truly is interested or not.|`|nYntQhBoaa	If he wants to talk, he will call.

HzUM8hVSaa	explain to her that you need someone to talk to, so you talk to your brother. Then tell her you don't like how she acts when she drinks. That it makes you feel bad, when you don't deserve it.|`|fOHn1ISdaa	Call this number .... ( 211 ) and ask for the number for the "Child abuse hot line" ...Once's you get that number. Call them and tell them what's going on in your home, between you and your mother.  Don't worry you won't get in trouble and they won't get mad at you. They will help you and your mother out. So everything will be ok!   .... Your mom may need to take a AAA class. So she can control her self in her drinking and other problems|`|snZ7z3DLaa	Take every bottle of what she drinks, empty it out and fill it with water.

xuDGrCSVaa	Yes, you are good looking.  You got a good body.  But I do think you should shave your mustache too.  You might think about letting your hair grow out and getting some corn rows or whatever you call em.  I think you would look good with them.  <br>  Just remember girls always want what they can't have.|`|4m3z1ztEaa	have confidence|`|ZYUeEbI0aa	i doubt its ur body thats the problem...most girls dont make that there main judgment on the yes or no. Its more on the how you ask and your personality and things like that.<br>  <br>  Also every girl is different, some like the confident approach some like shy people. My partner likes shy quiet alone people.|`|dH8LY8Lxaa	Flick the caterpillar off your lip and you're not that bad looking.
UPDQjv5Iaa	Well you shouldn't that only proves that he's not your real friend and probably just using you to make you a laughing stock so try hanging out with other people and pick friends who will respect you.|`|ayby0npIaa	omg!  boys will never change! you hear me? hes a boyyyy not a man. i would probably forgive him if he begged me a million times but i would never talk to him again!
2ij4wwjgaa	maybe people think you would have lost ur virginity cuz ur attractive or sumthin<br>  but bein a virgin is what ur supposed 2 be<br>  no wed, no bed...lol|`|RoqxGbgRaa	you're right.  there is nothing at all wrong with it.  i'm glad you feel that way.<br>  <br>  trust me: i've lived long enough to know that young people having a whole bunch of sex that they are not ready for is a horrible thing that they usually end up regretting.<br>  <br>  there are emotional costs to having sex that the majority of young people are just not ready for.  folks end up hurt, confused, ashamed, and sometimes humiliated.  <br>  <br>  take your time.  wait for love (and marriage).  sex will be there.  it's been around for millenia; it ain't goin' nowhere.|`|hSOYndoxaa	There is absoutely nothing wrong with being a virgin.|`|izznp1uiaa	i know, <br>  i am a virgin too, <br>  and all my friends are like ... <br>  i wanna have sex/i have had sex<br>  and i am like WHAT THE HECK!?|`|3KAiV9zTaa	there's nothing wrong with it. be proud definitely. give your virginity to a guy you'll fall in love with. you'll be more happier. i did and i am happy.<br>  <br>  i'm 16 by the way.|`|XsYrhdY2aa	There's nothing wrong with being a virgin

2LmfQUbKaa	it sounds like the problem is within you! you need to keep your friends close and let them help you you have peopl out here who call them selves friends but could care less about you! so if you have the type of friends that stick around dont be a fool! and push them away! it sounds like you have issues you need help on and you should let them help you!
zzaScg0haa	If you put "friend" in the quotation marks it shows you really don't care what she thinks about wether or not you go for it, all the road blocks are in your own mind
PVnKQG8Waa	DON'T TELL HER ANYTHING!!! Just have sex one more time with the babysitter then stop cheating. After that just tell your wife that some money went missing from your wallet and you suspect the babysitter took it. You do not want to report her to the police, but you also don't want her watching the kids anymore. That's a perfect excuse and keep the babysitter from coming back. Of course you now need a new babysitter to watch the kids so start the hiring process and repeat the steps all over again. Enjoy|`|dFUqPcWKaa	Be honest with your wife. She probably already suspects something, anyways, and doesn't want to face that it's the babysitter that the problem because, who would want to think of that? Fire the babysitter and, if your wife has any sense, she'll see if there's a way to have the babysitter lose any type of licensing.. tearing apart a family is in no way tied to caring after someones children.<br>  <br>  Lying to your wife will only do more damage to your marriage.|`|kTgU92nvaa	NO! i definatly dont think you should tell her. what she dont know dont hurt her. It will cause her a ton of heartbreak and pain,and trouble to your marriage.As long as u know it was a mistake and you wont do it again. As punishment youl have to live with the guilt.thats enough!Save ur wifes feelings,and ur marriage,and for the sake of your kids|`|W16vRFTNaa	I think you should and let her decide if she still wants to be in the relationship. How can you be with someone and not be able to have trust and honesty ?|`|AHZtje9aaa	If in the long run you want to work things out you should tell her because a marriage is based on trust and the ability to be faithful...|`|dlMZmdjNaa	why did you cheat? mabye it's time to talk forgiveness can only come when asked for and if she loves you and your marriage is worth saving then tell her.|`|IRlVBGWOaa	I agree with aubrey v.....you're a jerk.  Tell her.  I hope she takes you for everything you're worth (which probably isn't a whole lot).|`|1Thb8v1yaa	tell her.<br>  and fire the babysitter so it doesnt happen again.|`|gzXbiiWnaa	... i think its best you should<br>  and it's probably inevitable that you'll end up in conflict etc.<br>  i dunno maybe divorce<br>  <br>  way to go|`|1HyxHtquaa	yes let them know before she finds out from someone else<br>  thats a bad situation and clear your conscience fast|`|bbrj7lD5aa	Wow, you're a jerk.|`|ViRCkVcmaa	wow...what an ***!<br>  did ur wife & ur kids not cross ur mind!|`|VjMyHAWraa	Wow! Y'all sure picked a good babysitter! Tell her so she can fire the both of you!!|`|xtmFBjO9aa	Yes, you should definitely tell her.  If your relationship is strong enough, it will survive this if you are truly remorseful.|`|AA11391968	Why do you want to tell her?  Is it the fear that the babysitter will tell someone who will tell your wife or are you that ashamed?  It seems to me that if people feel secure in that their spouse will not know, the do not tell because they do not want to upset their marriage or hurt their spouse.  Only you can really answer your question.|`|81gHbOjBaa	Typical piece of ****. just tell her if there's a probability of her finding out. if the posibility doesnt exist you don't really have to worry about it except for the guilt you will feel. (if you dont feel any maybe you don't love her AT ALL, and should't have married her).|`|RGC2aDf2aa	OMG... you better tell her cause if she find it out by herself it's gone be really bad for u... (*_*)|`|ba11546863a841cea0081f35f682a3ccaa	i agree with tincan62..let him cheat w ur wife|`|8MTN47C9aa	I would come clean and tell her you did and that you want to be completely honest with her from this day forward. Tell her you realized how much you love her and don't want to lose what you have built together. Honesty is the best policy. If she leaves you, at least you will have the peace of mind knowing you were honest about it. And if you don't tell her, She may find out eventually and really end up hating you for it.|`|zAfKvhW4aa	No. Do not expose your sin to your already happy wife. You can't read her heart or her mind, she might leave you or never trust or respect you as much again. Don't hurt your wife by what she does not already know.  Don't destroy yourself even more by letting everyone know (family & neighbors)  that you are an adulterer.<br>  <br>  Never even think about going close to this most dreadfully, family destroying act AGAIN!|`|4RDfca9saa	Definitely tell her. If you don't, it WILL get back to her. It is better to admit you made a mistake and be honest. If you don't tell her and she finds out, you will be a cheater AND a liar.<br>  <br>  People do make mistakes, which can be forgiven...but it's a lot harder to forgive a liar.|`|nZUvBisfaa	Tell her. You owe her that much. How could you??? I hope your penis falls off and you get genital warts of the face you dirty butt hole!|`|wuZXqYPGaa	thats wrong on SOOO MANY LEVELS..and on the kids babysitter whut r u a little child urself. immature. yes you tell ur wife...<br>  b a man and tell her, hopefully ull still be married after that...|`|TMNSsI6iaa	The fact that you feel guilty enough to ask it on Yahoo answers shows you should probably tell her.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	let me cheat with your wife|`|E7RhMRKhaa	My advice would be no......

AA11150213	Usually if people are really busy but still interested they will suggest another time that they are available.<br>  <br>  Don't ask her out again, using the "busy" excuse is most likely her way of telling you she isn't interested in you on that level. <br>  <br>  If she is interested she'll let you know, for now keep it moving.

However, if you plan on having children, keeping it in the family, no matter how distant the relation, is probably not a healthy idea.|`|ByTmzw8Taa	maybe...?<br>  <br>  i mean, the relation's not that big is it?<br>  <br>  but still, it's a little weird. i mean, you at least have some of the same family.|`|k0B8err5aa	Sure! And when ya'll get married and your children are freaks due to in-family breeding, don't blame yahooanswers!|`|ryHdojcIaa	I would say no even if you really aren't close it would probably feel a little weird|`|ek7Ha2sjaa	Third cousin....yea, why not =D

Honestly, if you are not ready to do anything sexual with him, I wouldn't advise you to give him a *****.

E4TQE4RVaa	Since she and your sister are friends, it probably wouldn't be too weird if she said hi.  I don't know, I wouldn't think it was weird if my friends' little brothers said hi to me.  If she ever comes to your house with your sister, wait until your sister goes to the bathroom or something and just to try to strike up a conversation. Ask her about her classes and what you're going to be taking next year, I don't know, just try to come up with stuff you have in common.  Good luck!
vyL7yEleaa	i am normally all for getting married if you found the right man... but i draw the line at 16. 18 i think is the youngest i would ever think of getting married as most 18 year olds are starting to live in the real world and are maturing. <br>  <br>  but 16 year olds are still growing up they are still kids. it would be stupid to marry that young before you got out and got to enjoy the world. you might be happy now.. but when your older you will look back and wonder what the hell did i do|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Sure! Go for it! Then you can get the divorce while you're still 16 too! Great idea! (HEAVY sarcasm)|`|kHEFi3ttaa	if you're pregnant then yes. .. but your parents will have to sign off on it. You have to be 18 to marry legally in the United States. If you're not then wait until you're at least legal.

Also when there was no birth control and parents wanted to get rid of kids ASAP. In some societies, that's an acceptable age. Not so much in North America. Have you seen the divorce statistics lately? I do know some people who stayed together when they hooked up so young - like one out of hundreds. You change alot from 16 to 20, 25 to 30. Do you think you will maintain the same feelings through all those changes? Are you willing to accept divorce as a possibility? Divorce costs emotional pain and big $$$ for men. By some estimates, a divorce will cost a man at least 25% of his life earnings. Think carefully .... if you're asking is it because you have doubts?|`|MGVVbNXiaa	it kind of depends on the people that are getting married and the reasons behind it.|`|nEw1ZccTaa	nahh really, we aren't mature enough.

AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.
AA11032586	Consider yourself very Blessed that you have parents that care. Another rule of thumb, their house, their rules. Respect them or get out. At 16, I would recommend respecting your parents and their discernment for your well being.|`|T547TtDRaa	I know this is difficult for you.  I went through the same thing with my parents.  I had to wait to develop my own life when I left home to attend college.  There I studied, worked part-time, and did safe things with my friends.  I married while I was in college, graduated from graduate school, and went off to full-time work in my field of study.  <br>  <br>  Yes, I couldn't go to parties when I lived with my parents, but my life has turned out well.  I'm over the age of fifty.  I do many activities now.<br>  <br>  Be patient.  You'll be on your own before you know it.
8GO5VP1baa	take a look at the divorce decree or even the visitation rights paper work that your mother probably got from court. When my parents divorced I was 13 and I could see my dad every other weekend IF I wanted to. Take a look at that. It might give a piece of information that could help you out! But, running from your problems won't solve them. If you can, sit them down and let them know they need to listen and understand your feelings, and you need to understand theirs as well! If you can't do it in person, write them a letter!|`|5c615fe0b021c3a7f40c244c8041457baa	Love is the answer, and you know that for sure; Love is a flower, you've got to let it grow.<br>  <br>  John Lennon

MtQ9ea2Uaa	He likes you!<br>  <br>  He told you he was shy. He admitted that if he had the guts, he'd talk to you more often. He was also flirting with you and he probably felt braver since you were flirting back and his shyness didn't kick in. (Although it is myspace..) And the staring at you bit, yep, definitely a sign that he likes you..|`|C9z5g6pVaa	he doesn't like you.<br>  his interested in getting to know you.<br>  take it slow . get talking more at school,then phone calls<br>  then maybe some dates :)|`|vyHrvt0Zaa	Hard to know if he likes you this early. If he asked you to talk to him then do and then go from there.

0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	You are feeling 'relationship insecurity' not 'personal insecurity'. Some call it jealousy. I don't. Some guys can give you all of the access they want you to have... and only that much. You are about to make a lifelong commitment to a relationship with him, and the same for him with you.<br>  <br>  He should seriously consider losing his 'trophies' and get it straight in his mind and his heart how he wants things to be with you.<br>  <br>  You mentioned the 'last straw' which leads me to believe that there is more to this than you are saying. If you don't resolve this issue, you might have to seriously reconsider your future because it will be a thorn in your side otherwise.|`|kSEO2w8Aaa	I would not put up with that whatsoever!!!!!! I would tell him my way or the mutha fukin HWY!|`|LUhh9bSWaa	You're trippin...ya broad.|`|YJV2TU6taa	I wouldnt put up with it. It's one thing if all these females where just friends before hand.

Remember, he is being open with you and letting you see what he is talking about. Dont be so quick to think the worst|`|kTUL01tfaa	absolutely not, this is part of who he is and marriage will not change him, he has a lot of girls in his head while you are in his bed.<br>  stupid choice on your part.|`|1fa1d82a6a831651d482ff85ed3b01dfaa	There is no way you should tolerate any of this. He is being childish.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	no. he has separation problems. he doesnt like letting people down. i say that you talk to him and say calmly and rationally, that it bothers you. and you need some conformation that this isnt just in case. it is always better if your honest, not hiding it.<br>  Go crazy in your life or let your life drive you crazy!|`|NB4h4jTyaa	If you can't deal with this, you can't. I am still friends with most of my exes, my husband with some of his. We both have friends of the opposite gender. As long as he is being totally transparent with you, I see nothing wrong with what he's doing.<br>  <br>  It does sound to me like you're the one with the hang up. Before you even move in with him, I would suggest getting some pre-marital counseling. I met my husband when we were in our mid-30s. It would be unreasonable of either of us to pretend we hadn't been with other people and those people will always be a part of our histories.|`|aVPd5uBWaa	Just because he has friends on facebook doesn't mean he is cheating or a cheater. You can not smother him because then he will resent you and will end up cheating. Give him some space and allow him to breathe a little. As far as the exes, if there are some that you do not agree with him having communication with, he should break all ties. My fiance' ended communication with an old friend that I didn't like. He didn't like it at first, but it something you must be willing to do if you are really ready to get married. But, I think you have trust issues and you should take care of all of this before moving in with him and before marrying him or it will be torture.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	I'm sorry, that would be unacceptable to me. I think it's healthy for you to be "normal" around exes, but not to continue having a personal relationship with them that does not involve your current spouse or girlfriend.  I'm lucky to have a husband who doesn't have any girlfriends ... I wouldn't be able to tolerate it. :0<br>  <br>  It also DOES sound like he's keeping them "just in case", like you said.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	He's told you he has no intentions of changing.  So he is right in that respect that you need to either accept it or go your own way.<br>  <br>  It is fair that you don't want a man who has a ton of female friends, but it is not fair for you to tell your SO who they can and cannot be friends with.  this guy just isn't the man for you.<br>  <br>  Men and women can be friends and not have anything else go on but if your instincts are telling you something different or the situation you have makes you uncomfortable and he's not doing anything to reassure you except to tell you that you are nuts and the problem is yours then he's not the guy for you.  He's not even bothering to take your needs or concerns into consideration and that is not a man who cares for you.
8ilHQMq5aa	honestly i think their hearts are in the right place... but i understand that no one will replace your mother. but your mother in law may think that having a mother type figure around will make you feel better and she probably wants to be the one you go to for motherly advice and that is good. that means she likes you and you have the potential to have a strong bond with her. but obviously it is too soon to think about any one being a mother figure right now. <br>  just tell her and him gently how you feel. tell her you really really appreciate her being there for you and trying to help you like a mother would but you really can't deal with that right now. because im sure you do appreciate her trying to be there for you.|`|JiKWi3R1aa	Whoa jeez..I wish I was you<br>  <br>  I was only 14 when my mom passed and now Im 17<br>  after she died everyone seemd to care but it only lasted so long..<br>  <br>  after a week things were back to normal<br>  noone remember me or cared to comfort me and at the time<br>  I was hurting..I didn't want anyone to replace my mom!!<br>  And I still don't! but it wouldve been nice if I had someone<br>  to just show that they still cared..<br>  <br>  I think you should appreciate your fiance and his mom for trying to be there for you...Im sure they don't realize what there doing and only have good intentions..<br>  <br>  though! I can also understand you very much<br>  <br>  Maybe you can talk to your fiance about how you feel and tell him exactly what you told us!<br>  <br>   "Your thankful that they care but you don't want anyone to try and take your mothers place" <br>  <br>  Im sure he'll understand... then the both of you can talk to his mother!<br>  <br>  they seem that they really care about you and will take it well and with understanding..<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to express how you feel! go for it! <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!

They went from about 14 to 16. That's when the teenager thinks she has learned all there is to know about life.They think they are ready to move on and be treated like adults.Look at it like this. It took all your life to learn what you know right now. Your mom is at least twice as old as you. She has learned alot in 30 something years. What  she is doing now is trying to help you avoid some of the life scarring problems she has gone threw. You don't want your babies to get hurt.

LOL|`|5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	Stay positive, don't argue with them, listen to them vent briefly, then steer them to other topics.  Keep telling yourself, that they raised the amazing person you married, so they can't be all bad.<br>  Sometimes asking for their help with a small project, setting the table, helping with dinner, walking the dog, reading a story to a grandchild and so on, will give you a little break.<br>  They are part of the family you chose to join, so try to make the best of it.  If, after all, you find they are so toxic that they cause problems in your marriage, limit your time with them.  And never, never, put your spouse in the position of having to chose between you and his parents.   <br>  Down the road, chances are very good, that you will have to help care for them.  Figure out a way to make it work as best you can.|`|dNj1RjWHaa	ultimatly you can take only so much. right? my mother in law is such a downer she drives me nuts, everything is death this and life sucks that sometimes i just want to strangle her. but i will soon be divorced so thats what i am doing. oh and my wife sucks too. good luck|`|IvMPh09baa	avoid being around them.|`|VIKXnXuTaa	You put filters on your ears.<br>  <br>  You make your spouse aware of how he may have been influenced by their toxicity without knowing it.<br>  <br>  You thank them for their advice, and don't listen to it.<br>  <br>  You set boundaries about how long you will be there and what you will do if your filter alarms go off.

kRN7SPiyaa	Trust me... NO.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  It will come one day where she will realize she was never actually "loved".  When she is old and has no beauty, she will look back on her life with much regret.  Unfortunately we live in a world where looks make a person.  But there are times in life when people get there acts together and truly see what life is for them.  That day will come.  Don't feel ugly, just be confident in who you are and don't worry about her.  She will age.  She will rely on beauty until it is gone.  Then what?  Just let time pass and look past her.

If you tell him, it is going to be because you have developed feelings and/or love for him and are going to be trying to end their marriage or so called marriage. You need to quit with the three some and quit being another man's mistress. Find yourself your own man. There are too many STD's and especially HIV/AIDS. This type of thing is disgusting. You need to find your own man. One of the ten commandments is "thou shalt not commit adultery" and that is exactly what you all are doing.

AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.
83zdK7xDaa	Healing takes time.  It can't really be rushed.  If you know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, He will help you through the process.  Also, find other female believers, more mature ones in the faith, possibly who also grew up in messed up homes, who can mentor you.  Life for any Christian, male or female, is about being the right person, not having the right person.  Go after Jesus primarily, and the rest will fall into place, if it's God's will for you to be with this guy.  Remember?  "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you" (Matthew 6).  Just maintain a friendship with this guy, and have people around you monitor it, so that you don't move too quickly, for the time being.  Remember, "Love is patient..."(I Corinthians 13:1).  If it is God's will for the two of you to be together, then God will turn his heart to fall in love with you.  If it is not God's will for the two of you to be together, then you don't want him anyway, really.  God loves both of you and wants the very best for you.  Since God is smarter than both of you, He is in a better position to determine what is best.  Good luck, and God bless you.|`|wI3AAkIoaa	You tell him you have changed which is why you now go to church.

Next time, you might wait a little longer before talking about your past, but remember that the abuse wasn't your fault, we *all* have things in our past we regret, and the right man for you is the one who loves you just exactly the way you are, blotches and all.  Big hugs.

526fafb4a2990433e20d87f8d365ac7daa	I think I understand your problem because I've had a similar experience. My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 months- we're in college and when winter break came around I left on vacation for 3 weeks, we talked on the phone every night but when i came back and school started things go weird. I guess I had gotten accustomed to not being with him and one night we were lying in bed and he was trying to kiss me but in my mind I was thinking, please don't kiss me, don't touch me, just stay away from me-- and I said to him that something was wrong and it felt like he was a perfect stranger to me even though just the day before I couldn't have felt more in love- that totally crushed him and me I couldn't forgive myself for stabbing him in the heart but after deep reflection and a lot of thinking I realized that my problem was that I was afraid of getting hurt. so i was like purposely pushing him away, trying not to get attached, tell myself he's just a guy, there's plenty more- and it was horrible. On Monday i could be head over heels for him, but Wednesday he didn't even cross my mind... don't be afraid to get hurt, its going to happen (well unless you get married) but people will come and go in and out of your life and unless you love and give with your whole heart you'll never understand what it means to be in love or truly care for someone. Its a risk everyone takes and we all feel pain from but you have to give your all to feel the whole experience, and let me tell you, when i let go of that fear (but still keep in mind that might happen, but remember everything for the good) our relationship got so much better.<br>  good luck!|`|87588ac77a2edf755aa90ced98f153aeaa	I definitely know the feeling.  It's going to take some serious introspection or talking with someone to figure out why you feel the way you do and why it affects your actions.  For me, it's basically incredibly deep seated insecurity.  I don't make relationships anymore, not even friendships, certainly not long lasting ones.  It's important that you try to overcome this before you start telling yourself that you're just not made to be with someone and then begin cutting yourself off from people entirely.  Best of luck to you.
whtWq2keaa	you don't need nathan in your life, dont let him get in your way. since he talks behind your back now, you know he's unfaithful to you. go with adam, it's your life, live it your way :)|`|pU6fvgvIaa	First of all honey, when you break up with a guy, he doesn't need to know about your next bf. So, dont say anything to Nathan anymore since he would not be with you. Thats my opinopn. So, i dont think it did much if he's saying crap about you. He doesnt know what kind of a good girl he was missing so he may be the one with the problem. In other words, I guess you did good, showing him that you are interested in someone else.

If an officer is going to be there do not show up drinking of drunk this may sound stupid but people have done this and end up being arrested.

uRbeSOMwaa	ill still give it a chance.<br>  i dont care if she is saving herself til marriage, actually, i think it just shows you stand up for yourself<br>  <br>  which is a turn on|`|DJoojZ3Kaa	well.... being committed to yourself is definitely not a turnoff.... its being in control of yourself.. which is again what most men look for.. and im sure the one who you are talking about dint have good intentions about you.. so, you should be happy that you have avoided him automatically.<br>  all the best..|`|Unz5OISBaa	I don't think it's a turn off and a guy should respect that. But, as a guy, I would have to say that at some point the relationship will get more physical. I think that you shouldn't tell him until deep in the relationship, and if he still leaves then you got lucky to get rid of him. If he stays, that means he still likes you for you. I don't fully understand why you save yourself for marriage though. Why do you want to wait? If you aren't ready, that's cool. If you don't think it's responsible, that's cool. But if you are just "saving yourself" because it's the right thing to do or you think you should, that's dumb. What are you saving yourself from? Sex in marriage is no less degrading, meaningless, and removing of "innocence" than outside of marriage. <br>  Think about a situation where you were absolutely in love with someone, but you didn't have sex with him just because. He leaves the picture. Later on you marry someone you thought you were in love with and it turns out he is a jackass. You missed out on making love because you saved it for sex with an ex husband. This situation is just as likely as waiting and finding someone who you love and loves you and marrying and never ever splitting up.|`|pe9502BAaa	No it isn't IMO. But you must remember if this is your choice then expect this most of the time. Guys in college (most) have three things on their mind/ Grades, Girls, and Alcohol. Not necessarily in that order. Looking for that percent of guy who doesn't mind you wanting to wait is like looking for a needle in a hay stack. I think in this day and age of promiscuity where girls are now the higher percent of aggressors, you should be given a medal. If you are patient and don't give up you will find that perfect match you are looking for, BFN Focus on what matters most and  be proud of yourself :)-|`|PB9EklObaa	Ok been giving advice all night here If he likes you as much as you think he will wait but the guy took a U turn in another direction he was confused He thought otherwise If your going to wait good for you this is hard as it is to believe someone will come along and wait with you  as far it being a turnoff no I don't think so and I would give it a chance. good luck or maybe he may come to his senses and give it a chance good luck.|`|dyhnK4eNaa	i don't know weather its correct or not but as my life i had given my one chance to my girl because i never believe on the person and there words because i just go forward as my heart say and heart never shows wrong way . i believe on love i think we can change the world by love, but some one don't get this luck. i can say u just follow your heart that sol, if u feel i am right mail me because we both are facing same problem.|`|590dd2748ce32b631e9dced7f91686e3aa	well i told my girlfriend that we wont have sex until we were married!<br>   she lost interest in me as she wanted sex and was only there with me for lust!!!<br>  so i just broke off!!<br>  she treated me like an sex object and nothing more!!!<br>  well i think if a person loves you he will wait for you! he/she wont be in a hurry to get hooked as love last destination is sex and why reach the last end point before marriage and loose all the pleasures of a new married life before it!<br>  i am waiting for that special girl and i think i will get her soon!<br>  best of luck to you too!

If he does, great, if not, ok too. But if you make a move on him and its not what he intends, it will damage your friendship permanently. I suggest you wait and see if he does anything else
xkMadpW5aa	i'm not going to say that you're too young to be in love because you've already pointed out that you don't want to hear that so this is what i'm going to say:<br>  from like 4th grade-8th grade i really liked this guy who happened to be my best friend...well, my best friend from like 4th-7th grade.  in 8th grade  somehow, though remaining friends we weren't nearly as close.  i didn't know why, but for some reason i assumed it was his fault.  i came up with all of these ways to tell him that i wanted to be friends again and that it was weird how he was drifting away.  then one day i realized it was my fault.  because i liked him (and i never told him or anyone) i had kind of begun to pull away from him.  i was nervous to call him or hang out alone and that was why we weren't the good friends we used to be.  when i graduated high school, i found out that he had liked me in 7th grade.<br>  <br>  i know that sounds like it has nothing to do with your situation, but basically what i'm trying to say is you have to say what you need to say because you never know what people are thinking, and if you don't say it, it might never be said.<br>  <br>  and sorry, but i have to add this.  you may now think that it's love, but in not too long,you will realize what you're feeling in 7th grade does not possibly compare what love really is.|`|gv5DsZRZaa	i know this will .. kinda be a chest-feeling stopper, <br>  and thanks by the way for letting me know where GUYS get that feeling, <br>  <br>  but this is not love. <br>  it can, howEVER, easily turn into love. if she ended up liking u that way back and she ended up spending much much time with u and knowing u better than ANYONE has or does, then it will be love. but only if that happens. <br>  <br>  i have experienced love before, <br>  altho i cannot show it and i cannot express it, <br>  <br>  and i have also experienced that feeling that ur getting (altho in girls it occurs just above our *****) and it means that u just have strong affection to her and strong passion. that makes the love u might have sometime for her a lot more passionate, long lasting, and good <br>  <br>  its basicly a before-love feeling that comes on and sometimes leaves later on. <br>  i mean, even if u did love her, that feeling may leave even if u love her forever <br>  <br>  love can leave too. u can love someone and later on only like them and still have affection for them. <br>  <br>  love is like a care for someone. <br>  NO, i am not talking about the care that u tell urself u have for her, <br>  im talkin bout the care u dont even KNOW u have for her. like when she gets in a big bad sitch and u feel like crying even tho shes fine. <br>  love is when u know her better than all her friends know her, and u know things that others dont even nearly UNDERSTAND about her. <br>  <br>  love is possible in middle skool, its just rare. love is often mistaken for like, and want. love is more than like, and want, and everything. its awesome. its the light of life. its the most cherished emotion that God made so, according to most. <br>  <br>  u should never forget love and put homework in front of it, altho if it isnt real, then u should of course forget about the mistake u have made by forgetting everything else thats important too. <br>  <br>  i could never even TELL u (it has to be experienced) how hard it really is to sit there and think about how uve thought u loved someone that u didnt. i mean, u may stay up day and night thinkin bout her and thinkin bout touchin her, or anything, but that dont always mean that u love her. it just means that she is on ur mind. <br>  just cuz shes on ur mind dont mean u love her. <br>  <br>  expressing love has better rewards than hiding it tho.|`|w2kmLGWKaa	Sorry dude ive felt that way but its physically impossible at the age your at.its just infatuation and lust.

You're gonna be the only one wiping everybody's *** when they are gonna be the ones driving lluxury cars, working in an air conditioned office doing nothing but drinking coffe, **** like that.<br>  <br>  you should take advantage that your parents are giving you the time and money to go to school.|`|vZycNmAyaa	u cant have it all ... parents usually want for thier kids what they couldnt have for themselves which is the best ... 16 is a very hard age talk to them about how u feel ... maybe they will loosen up ... and if u want a girl friend u gotta stop drugs ... beautiful girls usually go for stright guys that wuld give an clean relationship ... good luck and try talking things out .. communication is very important|`|Ij3NmrpUaa	I feel very sorry for you and for your parents. It's so sad that you fail to see that they are the ones who really love you and want the best for you. Think about it, do your so called friends really care about you? If they did, then why are they standing by watching you destroy yourself with drugs? You are on a course that can only lead to disaster for you and for those who truly have your best interests at heart..your parents. Your "friends" don't love you or care about your well being and you're not a real friend either or you wouldn't be encouraging them in such a dangerous life style. You are self centered and very selfish. If you continue this way, then at best you'll be a very sad loser, at worst you'll be dead. When is the last time you thanked your parents for anything? Or offered to help them do something? Or said "I love you, Mom and Dad"? It's not too late to be happy.  The first thing you need to do is dump your so called friends and start associating with people who have higher standards and goals in life. Your parents aren't the reason you're miserable, you are. If you don't make some drastic changes now you will pay dearly for the rest of your life. This may sound hard nosed but it's very true...I've seen many like you and they never have a good life...unless they find the strength to make the needed changes. All the best.
MlCWsBcwaa	I would get him to read information like this link and see if he can honestly say it is okay to do that to your child directly (in addition to jeopardizing his ability to be a good dad to your kids).  If he can, then I think you need to stand your ground and say you will not budge on this (you have no option but to put your son's health first I think - your husband is a big boy and can decide for himself, but your son needs to rely on you to look after him as he can't do it).  Your husband deserves your support, but you still need to be firm on this.  Your husband is swapping one health disaster for another.  Maybe you can help him quit with tablets or nicotine patches.  Get him to go to the doctor and work out realistic options.  It is a serious problem and I hope it works out for you.  I have read that if you give up smoking by about 30-32, you can end up being at the same risk of some relevant health problems as non-smokers (not sure where I read that though).  Good luck.|`|PdxMOlcaaa	You can get information about what second hand smoke can do to your child.  Serious health conditions can develop in your child's later adult years just from second hand smoke, you are also being subjected to health risks.  Smokers will tell you that isn't true, but I have lived it myself.  Taking the smell away will not remove the harm, but vanilla candles will help with the oder.  <br>  <br>  Take a look at your husbands diet and suggest ways you can help him.  Reducing fat or portion sizes, but the best thing would be exercise, just go for some really nice long walks.  It's something you and your family can do together.|`|uGQMCDUuaa	Try opening the windows when he smokes. If its too cold, then go somewhere with your son...maybe to the movies or to the supermarket while he smokes. Try to talk to your husband, tell him that smoking is not the way, it will just end up killing you in the end. Try suggestion a dietitian, they will help him lose weight. Goodluck! :)|`|1YdeUn1Caa	That's not going to help him. <br>  He's never seen an over weight smoker before? That's a first. There's plenty of them. It didn't help their appetite any.|`|iCyroRDTaa	tell him to go outside!! if he smokes around a 1 year old then that's bad! pretty sure you can't put anything around the house. TALK TO A COUNSELOR!!! a counselor can probably help.|`|fOHn1ISdaa	Omg you guys are going to give her sec hand smoke and other health probloms. Gooness!  .... What you should do make an area where it will be ok to smoke.|`|YlyfZ9CRaa	wow thts fukd up u better tell that ***** to go outside unless u want 2 kill your baby dumb dumbs.|`|Ykz5WZTGaa	fat nugs|`|gASz3hDWaa	Why do you refuse to go outside?<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh I see, I interpreted it wrong. Well open windows while smoking. Use Fabreeze air freshener.<br>  Dieting is not going to help his looks or health if he is smoking more to lose weight. And he will stink more.<br>  Maybe try and pursuade him that his child has higher health risks because of his smoking inside. He might want to be on his high horse about it being all rubbish but insist on it if he wants to smoke around his child then he is being selfish.
2vg6pClwaa	Well it depends if you don't have many things to do just bike maybe go for a walk. If you have a movie theater thats a killer for a date!|`|de7iS7h7aa	have her and some people you both hang out with over and just play fun games. like 'never have i ever' and fun stuff like that
n5GXQAOjaa	show her how a real woman should be treated. Win her heart over, it will work. She likes him but wants better, if you show her better she will fall for you I'm pretty sure of it.
83zdK7xDaa	depends how much you like your boyfriend; everyone has feelings for other people sometimes; if you're going to leave your boyfriend though, let him know that you found someone else and break up before you go for the other guy; don't cheat.|`|h99Mcg6taa	Pick the one that gives you butterflies when you think of him, see him, kiss him...<br>  <br>  PLease answer mine<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ajft3J.MVT0kkHsKmj6fwjrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307200726AAkihJm">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ZOXP3HKlaa	The guy your with now, how much do you like him? if he isnt really all that you like then leave him but dont go straight for the other guy, but dont cheat no one likes a cheater
DPtQYt1uaa	Nobody wants to feel stupid. <br>  <br>  I think you should go tell your friend the truth before that person finds out the truth by another friend. If your friend was to find out that you don't have a tumour, s/he will feel so ridiculous to have believed in you, and trust will be lost and your friendship might no more last since all relationships are based on trust. If a classmate is be more trustful than you.. then, what's the point of her/him and you being friends at all? <br>  <br>  Tell that person that you are truly sorry and it was a selfish thing for you to do so.. but that is how you feared to lose that person...<br>  By doing this, s/he will see the true color of you and understand why you did what you did. Then, even if you did a mistake, you came to clear things out in a rightful way, with honesty. <br>  <br>  After this, your friend might take some time to think about things. If s/he thinks you as a true friend, s/he will eventually be friend with you "forever". However, if that is not the case, then s/he might not have been a true.dear friend as you thought her.him to be for you. <br>  <br>  Best of lucks!|`|cWuumdy7aa	you should never say such a thing to any one. do you imagine what that friend of yours must have gone through.you should just apologise and tell that you will never do again|`|kxMDFPnbaa	tell him that your kidding...if you had a brain tumor he would probably realize that you had a brain tumor... dont worry...i dont know how he believed you in the first place..you must be a pretty good liar..but a brain tumor?|`|dGFSQPlUaa	ok, i've heard of lying about a cold, flu, virus. but a brain tumor? come on! that's ridiculous! didnt see that blowing up in your face! sheesh!<br>  <br>  tell him the truth! people deserve to know that you arent sick...well, i would say your a little mental but good luck!|`|OHOPX2yUaa	Foundations on lies never stand for long. You better tell the true reason to your friend. Before its to late.|`|hlRVor7waa	dude theres no way out of it coz they'll get really angry with u.<br>  but still tell em y u said it,explain n talk freely|`|6XzvVUJTaa	First off. Why would you ever ever EVER lie about something so serious?? Second off. That was a very bad idea, lying about something like that, And its your girlfriend?? Issues.  Oh well cant turn back now, so I might as well try to help even if it is the wrong thing to do.<br>  Okay so umm you could try telling her the truth about it all and tell her why you did it. But then that could just lead to her leaving you but then again maybe not. Or maybe you could just lie some more and say it was an all miss-understanding or something that what you said was wrong. Hmm that could just cause more trouble so i dont know. Soo Good luck. =]|`|NSx8YmP6aa	Ok so you're lieing to your friend because your girlfriend thinks you're suffering from a disease. Ok you're not sick and a relationship won't work when it's made of lies. Tell them the truth. If you wait.... It might be too late for your friend and gf..|`|UPDQjv5Iaa	Tell her, I mean she's your friend, she must have cared for you and you should care for her by telling the truth and not giving her a heart attack.|`|TXYBYFLHaa	That's just cruel, you should never cause someone that pain. Reflect, and if you have any humanity you'll tell the truth and let her go.|`|yDgxAHO9aa	it's very simpal and easy|`|ke1SgRxTaa	stupid maybe u do hav a tumor y would u say that? tell them the truth
pg0q9eoUaa	Maybe you are not ready for a serious one on one relationship;you did not say how old you are but you are in school so I am thinking you are too young for this;you can be friends and hang out from time to time but you need to be able to spend time with your other friends as well;why does he have to walk you to every class? don't you know your way there.School is for learning and being able to be involved in the activities there; that is what should be taking up your time and attention.|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	Look like that he is very control over you. well if your heart say time for over it then do it.

t7S4vU7Qaa	I totally agree. If it is embarassing in your part, think how much more in my part cause I am a guy. I am 21 years old and my bro next to me is jsut 16 yet he is already as tall as I am. :'(<br>  <br>  i stand 5'11 and my bro is 5'10. but surely he will overtake me sooner. <br>  if its only your relatives that comment about it, then lucky you. me, my parents comment about it and i jsut can't do anything about it. good thing that my bro is really a good boy and just would pass off those comments. I love him for that, hahahaha...<br>  <br>  well, looks like we are in same boat. jsut do what i always do. when you are together with him/her, keep a distance,so they will not notice the gap. and wear high heeled shoes!
B359bLqsaa	my husband was also a crack addict and he had so many problems but sex was not one of them.  it might be different in your case, but there is no telling.  He is the only one who can tell you for sure but the chances of getting the truth from him are slim.  The only thing you should do is treat yourself as if you have been exposed to an STD and get medical help.  If it turns out you are clean then you can celebrate later.  Its better to face it head on and dont take any unnecessary chances.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Why bother even asking. It is in the past. Move on.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	Just go get tested.  <br>  <br>  other than that don't obsess  over what your ex did or didn't do.

What are the chances he cheated on you? Difficult to say but they, on one hand, could be very high as people who are under drug influence can't control themselves. On the other hand, if you was addicted to the point that he saw nothing but crack and was getting high to the level he could not walk, then I do not think he cheated on you.<br>  <br>  I am sorry I can't give you high/low answer, it is just not possible.<br>  <br>  Take care,|`|Z7lSdg61aa	more than very likely - they're liars and cheats and will do just about anything for the drug AND while ON the drug...there's lots of info / blogs re: crack online - educate yourself and get yourself checked for STDs if you haven;t already...whoever they were before that drug came into their lives - they aren't that person any more - and likely never be again...terrible truth...but TRUE...|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	No one can really say if he cheated on you. If so it was most likely with a man because crack addicts usually have problems having an erection. If you know how bad his addiction had got then you know if he would go that far.  Now this is not a definite but sometimes stranger things happen when people are addicts.|`|XOlnc8iBaa	I was a prescribed drug addict for 17 years and in truth the drugs come first. Unless he had to sell himself or he is a cheater by nature drugs do not play a part in cheating. Ask him.|`|wuZXqYPGaa	uh usually when ur on drugs doesnt mean that you go out and screw someone. drugs are just an addiction, unless he has a sex addiction as well...i doubt he did he better own up to it tho if ya ask him:)|`|q3KCDrMAaa	Who cares? It's over and he is gone. If you are really concerned, go to a doctor and get your self checked out...

If I were you, I'd just have a casual convo with her and play it all cool and say something like, "hey you know what would be fun? if you dressed up with pigtails in your hair... etc etc." well perhaps not worded exactly like that, but it's a starting point...|`|uxBnPqtYaa	umm thats kinda scary and you should get some help.<br>  but it could be kinky too. just talk to her about it.|`|gyNadSFpaa	that would be awesome... i want my gf to do that..|`|Njgof6hNaa	That is a lot to ask of someone. Uh, you could always ask her to share fantasies of her own. Try a few tamer ones with her, initially, work up to your star fantasy. Also, her fantasies should give you an idea of what she's into. I think before you get to your fantasty you should try some light bondage, scarfs, soft cuffs, but easy stuff. Work up to that. If she's not into what you want, it'll show. <br>  You'll then have to figure if your fetish is more important than she is. If it is, then it might help to let her go and meet people more your speed. Try fetish clubs or meeting people online who have your fetish in common.|`|JAruRfYqaa	that is really creepy. i mean really creepy.<br>  if i were you, actually if you want to keep her, do not tell her this. it'd be better if you just got over this.<br>  did you read what you wrote? how is that not creepy to you?|`|5pyHgpZkaa	its actually not that odd of a fetish, just tell her. Not like "I want to pretend to rape you", say you want to roleplay a little and see where it goes|`|xngBZmr7aa	WTF !!! Perverted pedephiles shouldn't be allowed on the  Internet freak|`|Ky3XC0eVaa	I bet she would do it if you agreed to do one of her fantasies too!|`|93bwPCV2aa	Not bad just kinky.|`|KDW2tANfaa	that's not weird, you like a little role play thats hot and kinky.. have fun ;)|`|pbTN9xYlaa	she might do it only if shes a freak|`|ibeFIUpkaa	That's a little weird IMO are you a Pedophile?|`|rAvZ9yGcaa	Uh... haha...  Just tell her.  <br>  <br>  ... haha.  She might like that.
Likst1Mxaa	You only did the wrong thing if you hadn't told him about the flirting thing/given him some warning about leaving him because of it. Like if you asked him to stop and he hasn't, that's cool.<br>  <br>  I dated a few guys who flirted with girls heaps, and called them on it several times. When we broke up it was a relief not to be with someone who was trying to hit on other girls too.|`|g6sNQ7p1aa	If he's "madly in love with you" then he won't flirt with other girls.<br>  <br>  The end.|`|kRN7SPiyaa	well yes and no.  He might have been just boosting his ego, but he was hurting you.  If you talked about it before breaking up then you did the right thing but if you just broke up then you didn't.  I wouldn't worry much about the past.  Look beyond that and have a girl's night!|`|2PDhpyuGaa	uumm do u flirt with other guys?? if he is madly in love with u just make him suffer then u can take him back anytime if he is so in love with you... or if u feel u did the wrong thing take him back n let him kno why u broke up with him give himone more chance n if he does it again u wont be takin him back...nuff said!!!|`|fpS90nx4aa	sometimes its innocent flirting.maybe he didnt notice he was doing it but it doesnt give him the right to be too friendly to other girls either.if he loves you then you shouldnt care much because at the end of the day hes w you not those other girls|`|Rj2ySnJtaa	That all depends on how you feel. It's a matter of opinion, but you seem like you miss him. If you take him back, set some standards for him to go by. Have him cool it with the flirting.|`|5YdcrgGoaa	maybe he cant help himself. if you arent in love with him then you shoudl have brokenn up with him but if you love him you would give him another chance and if he wants to flirt do it behind your backso it doesnt hurt. i doubt he would ever cheat and if he :LOVES you then just givee him a chance|`|yOEgoTsxaa	depends on what you mean by flirting. if he was seriously FLIRTING, then you did the right thing. but if you are doubting your decision, then you should reconsider.
DibzbnVhaa	Absolutely nothing can happen to you legally. You are both minors, your parents would have the same rights to press charges  as her parents do.

Never, ever, ever, ever send something you do not want other to see. If you are only 13, and she is 14, you have nothing to worry about legally. her mother can be mad, but that is all she can do. What I'd like to know is did the girl show the pictures to her mother, or did the mother sneak a peak at her cell phone? This type of thing happens all the time. Stop sending pictures and dirty messages to this girl, and you will be ok.|`|nYzcP5V9aa	You can't get in trouble don't worry about it<br>  You're both under the age of 18 and it's not like she didn't take part in this at all<br>  You're fine the girl is just and idiot and has a psycho mom<br>  Just be more careful next time|`|Ykz5WZTGaa	run my little friend, run far away. or sell the pictures on the internet|`|VqWBGWAoaa	You can't get charged.|`|Xexi7KCJaa	jump the fence to mexico or canada what ever is closer lol :p
wuZXqYPGaa	well it makes complete sense, comparin other men to him, cuz right now ur sooo focused on WHUT HES NOT. if it makes you feel better, my mom is the "life of the party" and my dad was the quiet, reserved, intellegent guy. and theyve bin married for 26 years.. my mom told me she had doubts, cuz she seemed to be more attracted to the outgoing men that always made you proud to be with them, but she said marryin my dad was the greatest choice she has ever made. they both dont clash(even tho they r complete opposites) but i completly understand that ur trying to explore other options (whut if there IS a better guy out there for me?!)  but i think that you need to give ur husband a chance, i know you have already and ur havin many doubts. but all marriages have ROUGH PATCHES and i think that if you give up now then theres no hope for the future. if my mom gave up in her 20s with my dad... she would never be satisfied. he loves you and would die for you... just give it time before you turn ur back on him. hope i helped a bit,, let me know if you need someone to chat to.. hang in there|`|a8f5edcc140b36ea895725f1c1fa0ff7aa	sometimes someone being diff from us, balances us out. focus on all his good points, not the bad. challenge him to do things that you would like him to step up on....in a loving way. and while youre at it, ask him if theres anything that he would like YOU to change...|`|azE51WGRaa	I think you're being a little selfish in wanting him to change into all the things you like. Did you ever consider that there might be some qualities that aren't so great about you? Marriage isn't about making the other person into "mr. perfect (or mrs.) It's about love, compassion, understanding. If you want your marriage to work, then I suggest YOU change. When you married him, you knew he had these qualities that seem less desirable to you. But yet you still married him and took the vows for better or for worse. So what if he isn't the life of the party? He loves YOU for you, supports you, and sticks up for you, even when you demean him down to nothing by comparing him to other men. If you want your marriage to work, I suggest you start by loving your husband for who he IS and not who he isn't. Otherwise, you might as well kiss your relationship goodbye.|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	Well it is really up to you if you want to stay with your husband but don't make him miserable in the process.  If he loves you so much then you should be glad that he is giving you that.  A lot of woman would love to have someone to just have a conversation with them every once in a while.  He is supporting you in everything you do. You should be on here praising him....not questioning anything. Respect him as a man and that will save your marriage.|`|g4UvGCx7aa	No one can save your marriage but you! I am worried about my relationship now and im not even married. I have low self esteem, no confidence, im miserable at my job and EVERYDAY, EVERYDAY I come home to my  beautiful children which I love but the routine has put a strain on my relationship with my fiance and I. He's a wonderful man not always what I think is "Mr. Perfect" but he's close enough because I can't see myself with out him..............enjoy what you have and be thankful..........you could have the opposite besides now is the golden time to fortify your relationship with out the "routine". Shoot, the sad thing is all I want is marriage and a change of pace where we make time for "US" rather than a DAMN ARGUMENT! The sad part is although we have a child together there's a real possibility I may not get to spend the rest of my life with him because we're not married and before we had a child we didn't do all the things to fortify our relationship!|`|wq95fwOFaa	your husband is not the person who needs changing, its you whom needs to accept him for who he is. from what you have described, you have a perfectly balanced and happy union, but because of your materialistic behavior you misjudge a good man and compare him with the non realistic side of him which you claim would make your marriage long lasting should he convert to the person you fantasied him to be, you have come a long way from dating him in a long distance relationship, that said a lot for the commitments you both have put in waiting for one another. Some women, have to deal with their partner gambling, cheating, violent attacks and being a doormat, some lacking love and care in a relationship. if i were you i would stop acting so immature and start enjoying my relationship with your husband, for the grass is not always greener on the other side and once you took your relationship for granted, it will a lifetime of regrets you wont experience until you lose him|`|D3hYbsVJaa	Why didn't you just marry yourself? If someone was exactly like you described, I guarantee you would be miserable. I suppose you're just perfect too? HE needs to leave you.|`|XH2o1MM6aa	.Grow up you made an adult decision to marry.Now your in the comfort zone you have the cheek and audacity to compare other men against your husband.He is incomparable and  deserves your undying affection and love|`|d28f15ee4fdbf2944e40df8ba2e01a24aa	If you don't love him for him and the way he is you are in a prison and he doesn't even see the bars.  You cannot change someone so why try . Make that decision to live with him or without him|`|F2wI6NGNaa	wow you a selfish b&tch you dont deserve him he should be leaving you|`|0PdYYeBFaa	What a shame...<br>  <br>  You have to understand you can not change your husband, it is something he has to want to do himself if he finds an issue with himself. <br>  <br>  Instead of looking at all the tweaks and what is faults to you about him. Why don't you try loving him of who he is.It seems to me you married your husband because you were in love with love. But possibly were not in love with him for who he was. <br>  <br>  If you want to save your marriage you are going to have to adapt and try to love him of his imperfections. Nobody is perfect...I am sure he can find some faults in you...but he is still loving you for who you are.|`|nZUvBisfaa	My dear you are selfish...I hope you know that this post makes you sound terrible. You married this man, that means you take him into yourself. You are supposed to find someone that completes and compliments you and by all accounts, I think he does. Its really a shame that you pit your husband against other man...again terrible. I don't think that your husband has the problem... I believe its you with the problem. I believe that you are bored playing house, yet your conscience keeps you from leaving. Get over your self and stick by your commitment. Love your husband or else you will force him to resent you. Final word of advice: Grow up.
ugJHDON6aa	if you like him, you should just say, look, I don't know whether you are into guys or not, but if you are, I kinda like you and wondered if you might want to go out sometime.<br>  <br>  if he is gay, then he will be flaterred, I am sure.<br>  <br>  If he is straight, I bet he would still be flattered, and he would just say, um, you know, I am into girls.  I mean, not to stereotype, but if he is into theatre type stuff, whether straight or gay, he is probably open minded enough not to be "offended".  Personally (and I am straight) I think it is cool for anyone to find you attractive.  I have had gay guys hit on me and I just say, thanks, but I am into girls.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|AA11605143	I'm not gay but if I were. I would tell him how I feel. If he isn't gay, HEY don't beat yourself up. You got the courage to tell your feelings to someone. You should give yourself a great pat on the back. Just keep your chin up and do what YOU feel is right.<br>  <br>  Good luck man!|`|pbTN9xYlaa	I think you should ask one of your friends to ask if his gay but if he says no then you should probably move on with the next person. And also you need to know the outcome of what he might think of you. He might go around telling every body ewhhh his gay. So you should really think hard of the choice your about to make.|`|7vTKcMgPaa	You have to ask him.<br>  He may be straight, bi, gay<br>  If he is you should for and ask him out.|`|ZyBXnK6eaa	hmmm|`|P8yQyumPaa	ew.|`|rAvZ9yGcaa	Go for it!<br>  <br>  Isn't it better to be momentarily upset instead of regretting not trying something for years to come?<br>  <br>  Besides, not to stereotype or anything, but being involved with musical theater people and musicians, the guys do tend to be gay...  or at least eccentric.  Nothing wrong with that!  Just trying to boost your confidence.  =)|`|vQpEkNJRaa	i know it's easier to say than do, but tell him how you feel and hopefully he feels the same way :D

zzaScg0haa	Why don't you talk to her before she starts dating some one else
EwJOA6rYaa	Does he have a favorite TV show or video game?  Wal-Mart carries some pretty cool t-shirts in the mens section with prints from trendy shows and games.  That would be a fun gift, and it wouldn't cost too much.
Unz5OISBaa	I'm a guy and I've only done it with the most recent girl I've liked. I check her facebook all of the time and I look at the same pictures of her all the time. It feels creepy, but I think it's a good release so I don't try to contact her too often. I think it is worse to come off as needy and scare her away than to do something borderline creepy. In this part of the relationship, she at least likes me, but i am mad for her. Maybe she's doing the same thing, but until we're farther along, I think it's important to not say how mad I am.|`|OZokMUaqaa	Nope....I am not a stalker......GET OVER IT!!!!<br>  <br>  oh<br>  btw<br>  im still in love with you harvey! YOU are soooooo hot! :*    (i miss you! remember me from elementary school? i haven't dated anyone else! im waiting for you!)|`|ZJdeXNiHaa	Yes, quite a bit, we just probably don't admit it.  I guess I never knew if girls did all the time or not though.
Yc8mcp03aa	I know it's hard. Try having BOTH your mum and dad down your back. My mum though there was something higher than an 'A'. LOL, that's the problem with Asian parents.  <br>  <br>  I don't think lying is going to solve much here, tell her next time the truth. If she's really getting on you, I'd recommend you tell a female teacher or just someone you trust to talk to your mum in a polite and not telling her off. I'm 15 and I had the same situation. I talked with my mum (like when she was in a good mood) and ask her what she wants you to improve on. Negotiate with her. I know it seems merely impossible with Asian parents but you'd be very suprised. In a way, I've benefited from being so under pressure, it helps you become very independant.|`|b932e920875dce5892bc32431779086faa	My mom is like that too but not THAT harsh.<br>  I guess every mother wants their daughters to succeed in life and not live the life they had and/or lived.<br>  My mom used to compare me with my friends but she stopped now that I'm all tops on everything.<br>  But I do want her to be jumping with joy for me someday.<br>  Lol.|`|B3RLAL9Iaa	well you should take some time with your mom and tell her the truth about your sister and how you really feel about this situation... if it won't help you should get professional help with a psychologist to help you and your mom Communicate better and just try to do everything right and have your conscience clean that you do what you are capable to do trust me my mom is the same and if you are younger than 18 just try to have good grades and get into college, you'll get to be away from her and all her noise<br>  <br>  hope it helped ;]|`|OpwMuboqaa	You certainly are not having a very good life right now sounds like.  I doubt that your sister is perfect.  No one is perfect.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't be abused by anyone.  It sounds like your mom isn't a happy person herself and is taking it out on you.  Maybe a little talk with her might help.  Tell her what you are feeling and that you don't deserve to be treated any less than anyone else in the family.  Talk to her like a grownup.  Tell her you don't appreciate her hitting you and that isn't going to solve anything.  She's taking out her frustrations on you and that isn't fair at all.<br>  <br>  Talk to your dad.  You said that she doesn't treat your dad nicely either.  Maybe you could get together with your dad and go to your mom and say these things.<br>  <br>  Just eat healthy food.  Being too thin is not healthy.
PdxMOlcaaa	Being a mom is not easy, I think back about times with my own children and I wish I had been more understanding.  Mom's want the best for our children and drugs are a really scary thing.  When your mom isn't busy and open to a talk go visit.  Just ask her about her life when she was your age.  All teenagers feel like their mom doesn't understand them.  No one can give you all the answers, but you can try to make a better relationship with her.  This relationship will change as you mature, but for the moment take one day at a time.|`|GegQJNzSaa	If you want to get threw to your mom let me give you a big hint on how to do it. She is not listening to your words.She is reading your body language,You may be standing in a defiant way. Your voice may be in a sarcastic tone.You may be loud.So maybe sit down at a kitchen table so your eyes are at an even level,and try to say your peace in a quieter tone. Maybe for the first few conversations you can talk about light hearted things and by the end of the week you can get into deeper subjects. Hope this helps|`|Qk7xiIkNaa	Your mother loves and cares about you.  All you have to do is - when she asks you something-say do you want to listen to what I am saying?  Ask her questions like that back.  Say I know you care about me and are worried about me but I am doing the best I can.  Tell her not to worry about you and say that she has taught you well so far and now it is time for her to trust you.  Say  that you love her and wish that she could  let you enjoy your time together more.|`|Rj08Nzv9aa	Your mother just cares about you you should just tell her sorry but i am my own person about the way you talk text and study but not in a rude way and ell her you are a leader not a follower|`|TFmKNu24aa	HI,<br>  <br>  I am going through the same problems as you are. My mother is very envious of me because she has no one. She does listen, but she's incomprehensible. It's very hard!! Yes, we all have problems, and we all have things going on in our life. The main thing you can do is to love, and appreciate yourself - if she doesn't want to listen to you, or appreciate you, then she's naive. Focus on the people who doe care about you, and love you for you. After all, you are the one to decide how you want to be, how to be, and do as you please. It's truly unfortunate that she's treating you this way.<br>  <br>  Amanda.

fuIUOJ2paa	flirting is talking. Talking can start with an easy "hi". Everyone says hi so you won't feel stupid. After hi ask him what's up by his reapons keep the converstion going.

As for how to speak - treat them like a little brother or something lol. Get that fun/joking atmosphere there. Tease him a little bit. Make plenty of eye contact, and touch his arm a few times. When ur talking to him, just stand really close - like closer than normal. Smile ALOT. :)<br>  <br>  Hopefully thats a few tips to get you started :)|`|dH8LY8Lxaa	About getting little boys?

zFx7NT2Baa	I think you have a good idea, that is, while kissing and making out, slip your hand down there and stroke and rub him up and down without taking it out.  Girls did it that way for me in situations like you describe. If he offers to pull his own zipper downk, if you are not ready, say, "not now" or something like that, however, if you feel ready then help him take it out, slowly, carefully and best if his pants are down (hopefully you are in a private place) so it is free to stand in your hand which you move up and down gently, maybe even with two fingers, saying to him, "How does it feel?"  Want me to hold you harder, both hands (I really like both hands and even a hand feeling the heft of my balls)?  Have a large hankerchief ready or if in a house, wipe him with a warm towel.  That really feels good.  And know this: after he comes, he will be tender there, even ticklish so be tender yourself. Keep your hand on it as he comes. I have been told by girls they like to feel it sort of twitch in their hand. Enjoy.|`|g6sNQ7p1aa	If you feel "weird" then don't do it. Or, if you feel like he's "expecting it" or that you have to, then don't do it. That's pressure, and that's wrong. I wish I would've said no to that stuff when I had felt uncomfortable.|`|fsiXYWEvaa	Nope you can do that<br>  But he might become controllive|`|OlISdLbtaa	yes you can!<br>  youll feel more comfortable about doing it|`|DWLbXd79aa	do it, have fun,|`|vffZ3is4aa	Do not use ben gay. it will hurt, burn, ouch! use some mineral oil if you want. be sure you have something to catch the fruits of your labor. Yes you can make out with him while you do it. you might want to put your head on his chest and watch. be carefull, if he doesn't tell you that he is there, you might get hit in the eye. try explaining to mommy or daddy what the stain on your blouse is. after, you can keep stroking, but be gentle, we are very sensitive at this time. we willn also leak a little. so be carefull. And yes you can get pregnant by putting it against you without penetration, so keep it away from your crotch.<br>   do not squeeze it to tightly, but do grip it. you can use a corkscrew motion also. I know your arm is going to get tired, if you stop for any reason, you will pretty much have to start over. <br>   you can bite or pinch his nipples , squeeze his sack gently, pinch his sack skin and pull on it. do not squeeze his nuts!!! it will ruin the moment. you can also scratch his thighs and stomach with your nails. anything that you like, we like also.<br>   If you get turned on by doing him, you can ride his leg  good luck.|`|86d9b2b62dcc28930dc4afb30d86ff38aa	If you feel really uncomforatable just tell him. Sometimes a guy will help you out (like his hand over yours) and kinda show you how he likes it..then if your feeling more confident you can do it all by yourself. <br>  Making out is a GREAT idea! BUT dont get too hot and heavy about it, it might lead to Other Things *wink* if ya know what I mean. So be careful how hot and heavy you get if your not ready to take that plunge...unless y'all have already.|`|t4ebT9araa	i've never given a hand job...so idk.<br>  but i do know that if you feel really uncomfortable with it, you shouldnt do it.|`|1Thb8v1yaa	lol it is definitely ok to makeout and give a handjob at the same time..<br>  and if ur uncomfortable with it..it def does take away the awkwardness.|`|9UYq9g38aa	Yes, you can do that, it would be normal, not weird.|`|wBSkGfxjaa	The guys I see have given great advice and good detail.  Those are the ways I have done it too.  Have a great time.|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	use plenty of ben gay on your hand, help him out a bunch|`|PEhWtWcmaa	pretend your going to bblow him and then like bite his sh*t off!!!!|`|YvvYtsjNaa	Yes, it's possible to do that, the question you have to figure out is, SHOULD you do that?  Maybe just ask him if he'd like you to give him a hand job.  Pretty sure he'll say yes.  Also, tell him you've never given one before.  It's kinda sexy to tell the girl how to do it.  He may have some special things he'd like you to do .  Some might say that's it's too awkward to talk about it, but isn't it even MORE awkward to stumble around trying to figure out how to do a handjob?  I can't speak for every guy, but I think most don't much care if a girl is inexperienced.<br>  <br>  Here's a possible scenario:  You're getting fingered, you'll be giving him a hand job.  You know what comes next, right?  Maybe oral?  Maybe intercourse?  Are you really, really ready for that?  Be honest with yourself.  Are you clear-headed?  Maybe you're just being swept away by the moment. <br>  <br>   It's possible that if he's doing a good job of fingering you, and you're doing a good handjob, you'll each get so passionate, so sexually aroused that you'll both feel excited enough or obligated enough to rush into intercourse.  Are you on the pill?  Do you or does he have condoms?  Is this what YOU really, really want?<br>  <br>  Next thing?  What did you think of his fingering you?  Was it good?  Did you climax?  Were you letting him because you felt you had to?  Is he attentive to your pleasure?  Since the stats show that on average, girls have 4 or 5 boyfriends before getting married, if this one is just your first, suppose a later boyfriend might be "the" one, but wants a virgin?  You'd lose out on him because you didn't "read" your first boyfriend accurately and he just was using you for sex.  <br>  <br>  Are you mature enough to figure all this out yet?  It takes a lot of experience, a lot of time, some maturity and, yes, sometimes some heartache to make informed decisions about  why and what you let a guy do to your body and whether it's the right guy, the right time, the right place  to do so.<br>  <br>  If you think this guy is "the" one,  how do you know?  Can you be absolutely sure once he has intercourse with you that he won't just drop you and go on to his next conquest?  There are guys out there just like this, and they're GOOD at fooling a girl.  If this is "the" one, can you put up with any flaws in his character for the rest of your life?  Do you even know how to detect any flaws?  Do you even know how to integrate your own character traits with another person on so intimate a level?  <br>  <br>  Be smart.  Know what you're getting yourself into.|`|Nvc2Kw7eaa	it wouldn't be weird if you were waiting for marriage.
lxAP3n3vaa	i think you have to talk to him at one stage and if you want to stay friends, the sooner is the better so you don't grow apart, it's happened to me before. i waited too long and in the end, it was too late. don't let the same thing happen to you. just call him up, ask him if he wants to hang out, tell him that you've missed him and take it from there. if he likes you and feels like he needs you too he'll be more than willing and even waiting for your call. if he's not the talking type, that might be why he hasn't called. he might be feeling embarrassed and doesn't know how to start.<br>  then just ask him how he has been and if you REALLY feel that the two of you can't accelerate into something more than tell him that, don't leave him confused, even if he doesn't take things very well. But if he really means that much to you, then i would try going out and seeing how it works for the both of you. give him a chance, give the both of you a chance. if it doesn't work, well it doesn't work. at least then you can say you tried. if you guys are really that close and it doesn't work, you can just laugh about it and say 'what were we thinking...'<br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck with everything. i hope all goes well =)|`|dGFSQPlUaa	i think its better to get involved w/ your best friend. that way you know each other better and already have a relationship built.<br>  <br>  you should try talking to him anyways. tell him how it made you feel. and tell him how you really feel about him.|`|toPFkM6Xaa	i think that u and ur best friend can TRY going out and if it doesnt work, if he really does care about u, he will still want to be ur friend! i mean he wont want to loose u all together! :)
25mllixyaa	You really just need to talk to your friends. Get to the root of the problem. If they are still acting cold towards you, it's better that you make new friends. I've learned that people change, they grow up. You might be able to keep some of your friends, those are the ones that you should hold on to for life. You're young, it's never too late to make new friends. Also, try not to cry. It takes too much energy out of you. I hope things work out.|`|2z7etZxhaa	i think u should talk to ur friends about ur problems
N4FA7Zttaa	I HAD THAT EXACT SAME PROBLEM LAST WEEK.<br>  call him as a friend and be like WHAT'S POPPINNN? or something<br>  and when you hang up, have the last word then hang up.<br>  or if you don't wanna call him, keep talking to him as a friend .<br>  hopefully he'll start liking you ;)<br>  but if that doesn't work at the end, try to remember that if you had a girl hitting on your guy, how would you feel? angryy|`|dH8LY8Lxaa	Trying to ruin another girls life?

ZRG7wEf9aa	It sounds like your at the emotional level of a 17 year old.  Gils just don't change boyfriends like they are a pair of shoes.  Give her time before you start nagging her.  In the space of one week you expect her to throw out everything that reminds her of her past relationship.  And you are already making demands of her to prove she won't meet another guy while dating you.  Grow up!  You need to learn how to keep your cards close to your chest.  You are supposed to have a filter between your mouth and your brain.  No girl wants to be controlled.  You should just have been happy to have an opportunity to date this girl after her boyfriend broke up with her.  But no, you jumped right in with your list of demands.  Work on your jealousy issues and give the girl her space.  If she calls you in the future apologize for your immature behavior.  You just might get a second chance.|`|NmLMUOkXaa	Give her some time and just be her friend, you don't want to be the rebound guy.  She was upfront with you about still having feelings for her ex, and it's difficult to get over a two year relationship in a week, even if she does like you.|`|VpBPIAieaa	I think you should talk to her.  It seems as if you really like this girl and always have.  Its safe to assume you want a relationship with her.  Tell her that, but don't push. I think this is just one of those to soon cases. Think of it from her side she just went throught a painful brake up out of a long term relationship almost every feeling she has right now is bad.  Keeping things help to remind her of the good parts of the relationship she gets a break from the bad feelings.  I think you should be open with her tell her how you feel and what you want, don't push understand that she is going through a very tough time. I guessing she could use a friend, so for now just be the friend until she is ready for more.

Sqe8h5Hzaa	Best Advice: Leave her alone! I know you really like her, but "if you love her, you must set her free" Really, it's true. Girls don't like it when guys are "clingy" and try too hard, maybe she likes it when you play hard to get...Just try not being around her or trying to get her attention for a while, and see what happens between you two.<br>  <br>  "if she comes back, she's yours, if she doesn't, then she never was"
0Xa4c6EMaa	Well, it's not really your fault that your dad's losing his job. The economy is pretty bad because of Bush anyways, so hopefully, all you can for now is pray that your dad's business will get better.|`|b6hid42iaa	yea have fun|`|Qk7xiIkNaa	Your not responsible for your dads business.  I'm sure he didn't fail because you didn't hand out his cards.  There are a lot of people losing their houses.  There is nothing you can do to stop it,just be supportive and positive if and when you see him.   These are tough times that we are all going through.|`|hrU14wMDaa	You are not responsible for your parents. That is too much of a burden to place on children, so if you are feeling this way, please don't. I am a parent and would never want my children to feel this way.<br>  <br>  Now, if you want to pass out the business cards here is an easy way to do it. The next time you go to the grocery store, leave one in the shopping cart. People must do this a lot because I usually find a business card in my grocery cart when shopping. It does actually work - as I read them to make sure it isn't something that I dropped.<br>  <br>  I am sorry that your dad is having a rough time financially. I am sure he was asking you to hand out business cards as a last ditch effort to save his business, but you are in no way responsible to make his business successful. To ease your mind, I doubt handing these cards out to your friends would work, as it is usually a parent that buys these products for their kids without the kids asking.<br>  <br>  Edited to add...please do not place the cards inside mailboxes, it is illegal to do so. Sorry!|`|BaguqDHiaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Maybe tell your Dad to advertise his business by placing a bunch of his business cards at Salons, shampoo shops or beauty stores. Also he should (if he hasn't already) setup his own profile page on places like Facebook and Bebo so that people can look at his products and contact him. And lastly if he wants you to help him out, maybe place some of his business cards on the notice boards at schools, Supermarkets and public places.<br>  <br>  Just an idea :)|`|gFKbY9mmaa	Pass them out!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ur dad might lose his house tell ur friends its for a really good cause my dad might lose his house dont disapoint him|`|Rj08Nzv9aa	drop them in the hallway of your skool maybe ppl will pick them up|`|FslHXbddaa	Well, you could put the acne business cards in different mailboxes.

Jk.<br>  Well, if you guys talk a little, maybe ask her if she wants to hang outt and get to know her(:<br>  then when you guys know eachother a little more, and you guys seem to like eahother, go for it.<br>  ask her out[:
xtmFBjO9aa	You definitely overreacted.  Call him and tell him that you apologize and that you were just a little jealous at the thought of him looking at other women's bodies to get off.  All men do it just about.  Be glad that its imaginary and not realistic.  He could be cheating with real booty ya know?|`|B359bLqsaa	I would rather have my boyfriend jerking off to a magazine instead of cheating on me with another woman.  I think he should decide if he wants to throw them away.  If he does it to make you happy, he will learn to hide it.|`|aLgY4l3Naa	Im sorry i would be very upset, some people say its not realistic BUT THOSE WOMAN ARE REAL what the hell do people think!! If your boyfriend wants to be jerking off to woman in a magazine then he certainly does not need you and if he does want you then he needs to throw that **** out!! I don't care what anyone says, its DISRESPECTFUL TO YOU and if he could do that it could lead to other things, porn is the beginning of the lust that drives men to do many other things besides just jerking off to the magazine, LOVE AND RESPECT YOURSELF because if you don't know one else will including your boyfriend, draw the line and set your boundaries and let him know how you feel, if he cares anything about you HE WILL consider your feelings!! Good luck to you!!|`|K6vEbdqxaa	Definitely overreacted.  Porn isn't a big deal.  Would you rather he went out and found some other girl to jerk him off instead?|`|RGC2aDf2aa	you did over react honey... (*_*)|`|13d4bd226d0dce7fe19e7693dc8cfed9aa	how you gonna do in the real world?|`|kTgU92nvaa	You have the right to get a little upset over him having porn magazines,but he probably had them before yall got together.Most guys have magazines or videos, i dont think its a dirty taboo thing, its just natural.So what if hes lookin at other women naked in a magazine,its you he loves.Dont push him away by freakin out!|`|V7976L4Daa	actually, you did over react. men do that type of thing. you should be worried if you find gay porno! then you have a problem. maybe he has the porno because he likes to read the profile about the models in the magazines. did you ever think of that? it could be harmless..really!|`|01kEv36Faa	Well, Its like sometimes you know something but you dont want confirmation.  Its one thing to figure, yeah hes a guy and probably does.  But to have him confirm it and rub it in your face may be a bit uncomfortable.  I wouldnt ruin my relationship because of it though|`|iko1uqBnaa	yes you over reacted maybe try looking at it with him sometime you might enjoy it and of course he will enjoy you enjoying it and even if you don't you can guarantee that he will be thinking of you before the night is done|`|W16vRFTNaa	You did overreact. i think if he needs some help sometimes then let him be. some guys just do not have a good imagination.
2LmfQUbKaa	it is good that you are such a goo dfriend if i was you i would wait till they was together and go up to them and tell you bf look every sence she has come back you have changed and you believe every lie she tells you and im sick of it so when you get done with all this bs and she shows you what a snake ahe realy is you call me! other wise we will just be see you around freinds because i have been there for you i have been a friend and if this is the way it is going to be with you because of her then i dont want any part of it you are my bf and i love you dearly but i am tired if being hurt by you letting her do all that she has done so i will be here when she shows her true colors and walk away and even if she laughs or says somthing nasty just keep walikung because in the near futore she will do somthing to show her real self and your bf will be coming to you just leave that door open and dont let her or anyone put you down you keep your head up and show them you ar esrong and you are a real friend! good luck to you!|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Well you might as well give her a last chance but make a mental note that it's really her last chance and if she hurts you again, she doesn't deserve your friendship.  Just find another friend(s) who is or are worthy of your friendship.|`|lumJDhIJaa	Even though she is ur best friend you cant keep going through that. give her one more chance but tell her if she messes it up that time the friendship wont last and you know that she dosen't care about the so called "friendship" anymore.
gayDcP57aa	I lost my best friend to drinking a few years back its a very tuff thing to deal with it will really bother you for awhile but you will get through it you will never get over it but it will get better as time goes on you are mad right now probally because of both reasons you to let your feelings out about it though its not good to keep them inside|`|ke1SgRxTaa	Just try not to think about it too much, and if it fells good, cry it out. My friends just recently went through the same thing... hard times
EbmieiNHaa	handj0b!!!|`|DkZfaIUVaa	Take him to the Army recruiter so he can enlist and make not just you but all America proud of him.  Your father and mother will love him for that!|`|wuZXqYPGaa	ok so maybe set up the whole day... take him to a unique restaraunt and get all dressed up and look real hot, then i think for a gift you should go on Jonesoda.com and click on MY JONES.. and put in a picture of you and him or take a picture of you holding a sign saying "HAPPY 18th I LOVE YOU" and then you can get 12 jones bottles sent to him with the picture that you want on it. it will be SOO UNIQUE and memorable :) and he will have it forever, plus who doesnt liek soda? and then maybe after just watch a movie at his or your place and set it up... have everything planned. sentimental things r often better than any money spent items :) good luck, hope ti goes rad!|`|ru0r0g3Caa	well you know him i dont what does he spend his time doing (other than being with him) get him something he really likes or just take him to a nice place like if you live near a beach that would be perfect. and make it something HE  would like not you!|`|gSFFHv1iaa	give him a wrist watch n draw the meaning of his name on some blank paper color it give those to him wid an light kiss n warm hug <br>  <br>  nwish him happy bday from my side also|`|2I2t0xWdaa	maybe u can make him a sort of video scrapbook? it would be a cute idea and it could bring memories of all the times you've been through with him. something like tht
E5rShmibaa	well, i like to pursue a guy, rather than him pursuing me.<br>  in other words, take it slow and dont say anything...<br>  YET lol
AA11149659	Well, i would talk to him first about it. You have to get some kind of sign that he's into you. And if he is, then talk to your friend about it. Think about who has a better chance with him. Has she ever talked to him as much as you have? If not, then i suggest that you go for him. BUT talk to your friend first. Communication is key. Don't just skip everything and go in. At the end, you have to be happy. So, i hope everything goes well!|`|t4ebT9araa	talk to your friend about it.<br>  see how attached she is.<br>  and if she mentions that he's just a little spark,<br>  tell her you think you might have feelings for her.<br>  you might get in a little fight,<br>  but telling her is going to be a lot better than just ignoring her.|`|5b69b0aee2e0929afbcd2166a8e14474aa	go on a fishing expedition...tell your male frind that you think your friend really likes him....and see if he shows a lot of interest in that conversation or will he say " to bad i rather like YOU" its his call , there is two of you and one of him.<br>  Just a note of caution though hun...i had a g/f once like you have, no matter who i dated or wanted to date....she ended up taking over my guy and when i made nothing of it, she lost interest  in him too....it was her way of trying to keep us friends w/o any guys in the picture|`|1HyxHtquaa	talk to your friend and let her know whats going on and find out if its okay with her, or work out a compromise, dont give up!
lGmyFOxiaa	It sounds like he's acting suspicious. I would usually trust your instincts. It could be stress or he could be doing something shady. You need to sit down and try to talk it out. Try to sound non-confrontational. Say, " Hey, is there something bothering you lately? " or something that sounds like you're not placing blame. Communicating is always the key to getting somewhere.|`|Z4B93N31aa	aww im sorry<br>  have you talked to him<br>  <br>  mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhDzHZ53F..Aj5t8hqfh4B_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307220048AAQb0hd">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

Does he really?  No.  He just likes the idea of me one day saying "I love you too" so that he can conquer every girl in school.  So does he like you?  You should ask him.  Haha, he'd probably be embarrassed after that.|`|mpgpImZyaa	He does.<br>  I do the same thing with guys I like, and if they admit it I give them crap about it.|`|FhPTIU08aa	he likes you..... he just wants you to admit it so he can tell how he feels..|`|wbgqfqrqaa	YES now go out with him|`|b0567ce2ec94aad1068db86dfdd2c890aa	haha,<br>  say yes and find out :)|`|kl4uqG0Laa	oh yeahh :)|`|fma8N2VEaa	its probly yes seeing how every one else says the same thing|`|XF6njLPEaa	You see , its like this.................wait, What're we talkin about?? :D|`|vNAw06uzaa	He likes you.<br>  It's flirting.<br>  I do it with my best guy friend all the time.<br>  Unfortunately, he's taken but we still do it behind his girlfriend's back; i know harsh.<br>  But should i say it's harmless flirting?|`|7THwaLkAaa	depends on his age/maturity lol. but probably yes|`|ru0r0g3Caa	well of course he likes you hes trying to get you to say you like him so he wont feel stupid that he likes you|`|FJKNA1ZZaa	YES!!!|`|VnXcucNTaa	he hates you just kidding he loves you, maybe?|`|MtQ9ea2Uaa	YES, he likes you!

Njgof6hNaa	It's good that you have such an understanding mom and bf, but I can see how difficult it must be to maintain these relationships, when you're falling apart. The one thing that is clear and most difficult is that you need to let this man go. I know he's your dad, but he's not ready to be a dad yet. Someday he might, but that's not clear if it'll happen. Meanwhile try to find comfort in the relationship you have with the friends and family you currently have. <br>  Be honest with the people in your life and tell them how you're hurting over this. Also, it might help you to be honest with your dad too. Write him or call him and tell him how his actions have hurt you. Confronting someone about how they've hurt you is hard, but it makes you feel better long-term. I hope everything works out for you. But seriously, draw close to your loved ones and tell them what you need and how you feel. <br>  Something else you can do is start writing in a journal. Writing out your feelings and thoughts helps your break them down. It can also help with some of your anger. It might also help you to see a therapist. Sometimes it helps to tell a stranger how you're feeling, because you don't have to see them at the end of the day or come home to them. Their sole task is to help you feel better. That would help. Ah, and be picky about who you pick for a therapist. Pick someone you feel good about and wouldn't mind opening up to. Treat it like an interview. Pick someone who makes you feel safe and open.|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Now stand back, step out of the childhood feelings, and look at life  with adult eyes. You can't be abandoned as an adult because where ever you go, there you are and you are all you need as an adult.

I don't know if he <br>  loves you or not or is just put off by your mother <br>  but you won't move on with your own growth as <br>  a person until you shoulder this distress and get<br>  on with it.  Sometimes you just have to put your<br>  own heart first to save yourself.|`|WniOOchkaa	The best thing you can do (and not to sound mean) is to get over it.  That's your father's mistake for not wanting to be a part of your life....not yours.  You did the mature thing by contacting him and offering him to be a part of your life and it was his choice not to.  All you can do is move on and learn from his mistake.  Don't do to other people what he did to you.  My father did basically the same thing and yes it is sad that he was like that, but I try to use it to make me stronger and as motivation to not be like him and do the things he did.  Be a better person than your "father".

KhCcGy25aa	I know what this is like, from one of my friend's experiences.<br>  <br>  It sounds like they're not doing to spite you, sounds like just a bit of fun.<br>  But, if it is upsetting you I think you need to either, talk to your friends seprately and ask them to stop, or ask them why they do it.<br>  <br>  Or you could tell a teacher/parent/gaudian because this is believe it or not is a form of bullying, eventhough it sounds just like fun.<br>  <br>  Either way the only way you're going to get this stopped is by telling someone. Or if you don't want to do that, ignore them and find some new friends to hang out with.<br>  <br>  On the otherhand if you don't want to do that, maybe try and make fun of them in a joking way, that's what me and my closest friend do to eachother, it's funny, but we both know it's just a laugh!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck!|`|B5Qzt5IPaa	Ah I know how you feel. I used to hang around with people like that.

Like if they see another ugly person and they say that just say "No, I thought she looked like you actually."  or even make fun of yourself. I learned to do that, and really, you can't make fun of someone else unless you learn to make fun of yourself :)|`|bBSYxQlAaa	Wow they sound like real asswippes<br>  <br>  ok talk to them both at the same time and tell them how you feel about them talking to you like that or threaten them eg i wont be your friends if you keep that up. or something because if they keep this up you know that they arent really ur friends
GegQJNzSaa	I was married to a drug addict for 20 years. When it gets down to it I loved him,and I still do. Between us both we made good money,not rich but we owned a home. But his drug habbit cost alot. I never owned a new car.We would only have the one used car. I walked to work cause he did heating and cooling and had to drive all over to do his job. He even gave it away for crack once. I sometimes held down 2 full time jobs to get us cought up with bills. I was sick of it and threatened to leave. Then one day I did. I was gone for a year and a half. In that time I bought all new furniture and a new car. I only made one third of his income. I also left him with the kids so he would have to have some responsibility. I would stop at the house every morning after work.Get my kids off to school,sleep there during the day,fix super for the kids,help with homework and then leave before he got home. It was like I never left,but I did. I moved back becouse a lawyer said he could file abandonment charges. We did another 5 years of his crap.Then when my youngest said "mom,I wish you were happy" I felt good to go.So we divorced after 20 years. Its nice not to have to look at him every day.I wish like hell things could have been differant.but drugs meant more to him then me. We are still close. My kids are happy I stuck it out. I don't regret it.I'm still young enough to ride off into the sunset on my Harley (I bought after the divorce) Only you will know how much crap is worth putting up with. I did the right thing for my kids|`|5i4vUQhgaa	it sound like your finally getting sick of his**** its time to let go if you have already had to talk to him like a child then its time to go.  or you are going to keep on talking to him like a child (it never changes).|`|dNj1RjWHaa	follow your instincts, ditch him.
Rj08Nzv9aa	its problably just because he is not in her life anymore i think its a normal thing to happen he should be sad about it but hen she says hate she doesnt really mean it so bad. You should try to get him to talk to her mother so that he can be in his daughtes life a little more
XmJZkFuMaa	Donating the clothes can really help people out.  It's what we did with my grandpa's clothes when he died.  We actually offered his clothes to anyone who needed them in the family first, then they were taken to his church and donated in that way to the boyscouts' garage sale/fundraiser.  Since he had donated so much of his time and service over the years, it seemed fitting.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	You give them to charity. Or to a person you know who really needs them|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Maybe if your mom wants to do that, then you need to respect her wishes.  Maybe you can keep a few things if they are important to you and bring you some comfort, and the same for other people in your dad's life.  Donating the clothes or proceeds for selling the clothes to charity is a constructive thing to do.  Maybe donating the clothes to a charity a bit away from where you live might help.  If you donate them, then they will be gone and the job will be over with (even though it is still sad, you won't have to worry about actually facing the task anymore).   Perhaps not having to do it alone might help you too.  Good luck, and sorry about your dad.|`|g24NZnjNaa	It's different for everyone. First I am deeply sorry for your loss. I know how hard it is.<br>  <br>  You might want to keep them because they still are something special.

The a-hole will predictably treat you like trash, except for the maybe 1/4th he doesn't... So somehow its more desirable and fun to be treated like crap 75% of the time?  And just because a guy treats you well doesn't mean he isn't tough and won't put a guys head through a wall for treating you poorly.|`|2nPwq257aa	The "good" ones have become bitter because of how much they have been s%@t on all their lives by idiot women like the ones you just described. <br>  It doesn't take long to see that being genuine in the dating world hurts only the good person.|`|1uR2zPnEaa	i would like to know what happend to him too : /<br>  if you find him let me know|`|60NclxBFaa	girls like bad guys because i guess they are turned on and they like being someone's B!tch!!|`|zNR9Ik3Daa	..he got boring and predictable.|`|88659fb68a525a5b01a64e02c0248d60aa	Very good question, unfortunately, I'm a girl who seems to always go for the "idiot" guys too.

However, this is not always true! Just because you're having problems with your social life does not mean that everyone is against you. <br>  <br>  Okay, so you said you had low self esteem. Did you ever think that you think you're ugly because your having trouble with your looks? I bet in real life you're very handsome, but you just don't realize it. <br>  <br>  Personality wise, I don't think its your looks that is making your personality "sour." I think it's the fact that you think everyone in the world is against you. I highly doubt that! Think about all your wonderful family members. Do you know how much they love you? I'm sure they really care, and they don't like seeing you depressed like this.<br>  <br>  If you have a bad attitude about something, it's going to get worse. Start thinking positive! :] think about that wonderful woman that you're going to meet one day and fall in love with.<br>  <br>  I believe that everyone has someone in this world, that was made just for them.

Dont blame your personality on not having great looks, because if anything it should be a reason to improve yourself mentally and emotionally. Trust me, girls will love a guy with a sense of humor and a good heart no matter what he looks like, if not romantically as friends. The key is being able to rely on yourself, because if you rely on anyone else to much they can feel smothered. And if that person isnt there you have nothing to fall back on. things will get better if you make it better. all things, including life, are only what you make it.|`|R4VrBPfLaa	Well dude, first of all don't give up. You need to smile and laugh allot.<br>  Then you need to go and be outgoing. Oh and you need to have a good personality, girls like that type of stuff, and you also need to have a combination of romantic, funny, and chill, and the hippie side, that's good to have. Just have faith dude, there is someone for everyone.|`|qiChP3Uxaa	Being dead is not a great ice-breakers with gals!! :)<br>  <br>  sick of living??? Sickness is something that reminds you that you are alive.<br>  If you have seen the movie "Troy", it has a scene where the guy says "Gods are jealous of us, because we can die. and hence we appreciate all we have" (or something of that effect)....the point being we are lucky to be living dude!!!<br>  <br>  Moreover, consider this....even if you kill yourself now, you will in all probabilities, be reborn....go through all those tough 20 years AGAIN (remember all those school times and all those homeworks...you wanna do them again???), and you still might not get a girl!! <br>  <br>  you are who you are, and someone WILL like you for that!!|`|X6qrh5ZWaa	why would you do that? for really, why would you waste a perfectly good life just because you dont think your the best looking person. who decided if you were good looking or not?  i know everyone was made beautiful even if you dont think you are. just wait you will find a girl, but if you waste your time thinking about how bad you look, and how mean you act you wont have time to find the one perfect girl for you. just get out there and try. You cant get worse then you are so you might as well come up from rock bottom and enjoy the next 80 years of your life :)|`|oDsFSXhhaa	I think you are superficial on top of it. Your right why bother.

Take small steps and make small choices to gain confidence in your ability to make a decision. As you become secure in your ability to make good choices, you will gain confidence in yourself, and be more secure about your abilities in general.<br>            * For example, if purchasing jeans makes you nervous because of having to decide on brands, colors, and styles, then just take the plunge. This is a minor decision that can always be rectified by exchanging the jeans if you really feel you made a wrong decision. However, try to stick to your original choice.<br>            * Buy a shirt next, to go with the jeans. Take your time trying on different styles and colors. When you feel a bit of excitement inside of you, you will know you are making a good decision, so buy it. It is that inner feeling that will help you build up your feeling of self worth. You will begin to think, 'If I can do this well, I can do other things!' Your confidence grows, and so does your self esteem. Confidence and self worth go hand in hand.<br>            * Wear your jeans and shirt the next time you go to meet friends. Show off your outfit. You will know by the compliments you get that you did indeed make a good decision. Smile and be proud of yourself because you took the first step of many in gaining confidence in yourself via your ability to make decisions. The new found confidence comes from your willingness to assert yourself and make a simple decision.<br>     2. Don't always try to please others. It is considerate to care about others' feelings but your needs are important also. Do not try to be like someone else either. You will be at your best when you are being yourself because of your uniqueness. Strive to be your best, do not criticize yourself if you fall short of your expectations.<br>     3. Avoid negative people. People who have a negative attitude which may rub off on you are not good for you. If you're timid, loud and aggressive people are probably not good for you. Whatever you do, do not compare yourself to others. Just be the best that you can be.<br>     4. Face your fears and forget all your failures. We only fail when we do not make the best out of adversity. When something doesn't go the way we would like it to, there is something to be learned from that, which can be applied next time you are in a similar situation. Get up and try again.<br>     5. Stop the negative thoughts. Try positive thinking on for size. The term “self-fulfilling prophecy” in relation to self-esteem basically states that whatever you believe about you, whether it be perfect or totally off base, becomes true. If you constantly tell yourself you are stupid or that you will never achieve success, you will in turn act as such. So, make a habit out of saying positive things about yourself and use the self-fulfilling prophecy to your advantage.<br>     6. Improve your self confidence. You can do this by simply doing things that you make you feel good, like accomplishing something. Accomplishment is the key ingredient to gaining self confidence. Just do it, don't worry about making mistakes. We all make mistakes.<br>     7. Do something to impress yourself. Volunteer at a homeless shelter or vet's office. Be a Big Brother or Sister. Help someone else. Nothing makes you feel better about yourself than seeing how your help can make someone else's load a little lighter. Take a class, study hard, and pass - learn something useful or interesting. It could be photography, oil painting, a literature appreciation class, or beginning guitar. Do a daring feat: bungee jump off a bridge, skydive, go hang gliding (all with a guide, of course). Accomplishment raises self-esteem by raising self confidence.<br>     8. Don't worry about being "perfect." Aiming for perfection in life is a lost cause because it is different things to different people. Nobody is perfect in the eyes of everyone else, so by trying to be perfect you may just be setting yourself up for disappointment and failure. Instead, seek to achieve goals. For example, take a class in the visual arts. The visual arts allow you to explore yourself and find "perfection" in "imperfections". This self exploration, artistic knowledge, and the accomplishment of finishing the class can do wonders for your self-esteem.<br>     9. Learn to appreciate yourself. Everyone has strengths, weaknesses, habits, and principles that define who you are and can make you distinctive. Spend more time focusing on the qualities about yourself that you like and less on the ones that you dislike. You can better accomplish this by taking up hobbies and projects that you can do that will make use of your strengths. Additionally, by starting on some projects that emphasize your good traits, it will keep you busy so you will end up spending less time thinking about your weaknesses.<br>    10. Reward yourself when you succeed. Bask in the glow of

y1k5wxgqaa	I haven't seen one but I have seen pictures. I'm really afraid of ghosts. :( When I'm alone, I always imagine that there's a ghost near me or looking at me. :((<br>  (with pics)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aj_rTn3BIbZpvawSGWXG5bjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307230648AATh8nj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XCrkjoQQaa	ghost is a spirit. the spirit of man once removed from the living being the body is dead. Ecclesiastes 12:7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it. this means if you see a ghost or spirit visibly it is sure that is not the spirit of man, because the spirit of man returns unto God who gave it. the question is whose spirit is that ghost when it becomes visible to whoever believes in it? in all probability that is an evil spirit but not the spirit of man.<br>  i have not seen a ghost as a visible form but i have felt its manifestation and i had goose pimples when i felt it. but if you are referring to a ghost created by the play of the mind because of emotional feelings that is even dangerous because that can command an action on the part of the person entertaining and believing it. that will lead to negative action of the person affected such as ill feeling, shame which could not be understood by that person, the result is a broken spirit Proverbs 17:22 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine; but a broken spirit drieth the bones.|`|e6Kyqb22aa	Yes, I saw one but strangely, it did not scare me.

PfXpTwBwaa	I'm Not Racist Grrrrr... <br>  <br>  JK <br>  <br>  that's mest up i think you should move on <br>  (i think the whole parent thing is a fake)|`|N7gOE1btaa	That is not racist.  You need to understand that some people cannot handle the strain of such a relationship.  Its great that maybe your parents will accept it, but some people simply wont.  She would essentially have to choose you over her family.  I'm sorry you got burned in the process, but at least she was honest upfront.  Its tough in life when you have parents who don't approve of things, and its a heavy burden.  Please understand her instead of taking this as some racial hit, because I doubt it is.  I'm sure she likes you too, but the whole situation is just too much for her.|`|uTmQNzpCaa	She may not be racist, her family could be, so it really has alot to do with her decisions in life, especially if she lives at home with her parents. If you live with your parents you really cant disobey what they say. So dont take it personally, there are plenty of girls out there who dont give a **** and like people for who they are and not the color of their skin.|`|Za3iJC3paa	Well to be completely honest my parents would have one helluva fit if I brought a man of color home to them. This man would make it through ten minutes before he felt the need to either snap or go home! If I really liked someone, I would never want to put them through that! <br>  <br>  I know this is not just a problem with white families telling their kids not to be with men of color! I have had black friends tell me I couldn't go home with them because their mama doesn't like the "white folk" <br>  <br>  Its really kind of sad but I think in a generation or so most of this underground "racisim" or misunderstanding should lift...hopefully. It is VERY real..and its not cool! <br>  <br>  I wouldn't dub her as a racist. Maybe misinformed...you could also dub her parents that as well...or maybe we could just all look at and accept the differences that are actually there and accept them like real grown ups! Haha wouldn't that be nice? Maybe one day you will meet a girl that will step up against conflict for you...even if its against her parents will. I know my parents hated my boyfriend for a LOOONNGG time and did not accept our relationship. Finally, after 3 years of struggle and fighting over his real personality/character they are starting to see that I know him like I say I do. I hope you find that girl you're looking for. Some people will fight and some people won't. Sounds to me like you need one of us hard headed bias with love for you :o) Good luck!|`|RvYqObe7aa	No shes not,my family isnt racist just doesnt like mixing color,i dont believe that,but i probably wouldnt date one because of dissapointment from the family,i mean everyones looking for that prefect son in law you get me,but she probably like you alot too.|`|j0mI8l07aa	If that's really the ONLY reason she won't go out with you then at the very LEAST she is perpetuating racism. If her family is that racist, and she doesn't call them on it, then she's probably at least a little racist herself.|`|loA0R4iIaa	well where im from there's nothing but colored ppl so besides that there is nothing wrong with dating a different color person  if my family did not like who i date then that's there fault their not the ones dating them i am and if they really loved me they would c that im happy and would not worry bout it|`|Emx7bwDVaa	If someone said that to me I would consider it racist. But what people believe is their decisions I guess...<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it. (:|`|ayby0npIaa	leo, its her parents fault for teaching her that theres a difference between black and white, we are all human beigns|`|5tQqcDyKaa	not neccesarily she just might not be into you.|`|ayM5TlcXaa	no it doesnt it just means her parents are. but just so u kno u shuld probably stay away from her and find sumone else|`|1hciyvKdaa	Just because someone decides not to date someone out of thier own race, doenst necessarily mean they are racist at all. Personal preference, is personal preferance, and it could be she found it easier to say that, then to say that she does not date out of her race. <br>  You took a chance asking someone out and they said no, take it as that. <br>  I am not racist, but I know in my head what my dream man looks like, and no matter how nice or sweet talking any other man is, if he does not fit the profile I want, he would have no chance with me. We are all individuals, and if my thoughts on the type of man I like is shallow then so be it, its my life my choice, just like her life her choice. So leave it alone, leave her alone and find someone that you are their dream man. You will find her dont worry.|`|clcMZmHhaa	She's probably just an innocent girl that still cares about what her parents think about her actions and still wants their approval. She is probably very close to them. I don't think it's as much her being racist, maybe her parents are, but she just wants them to accept her and her life choices. I wouldn't take it personally. She probably likes you too, just doesn't want the drama or being torn between love and her family. It's a hard place to be. It sucks though that you have to be in the middle of all of it and nobody can help the color of their skin, it's really very shallow that someone would base love on skin color, but some people grew up in a different time and it's hard to let go of things that are all people have ever known. I don't think she's a racist, though, just torn between her family's love and the point where people make their own decisions regardless of other's opinions about it. Maybe she will change her mind once she is more independent. Just try to be her friend and maybe something will happen. Maybe her parents don't know any black people. If you get close to her by being a good friend and hanging around her family maybe you will change their mind about their perceptions.|`|LisP31O8aa	You are wrong.  Stop over-using that ugly word.  This girl is respecting her family's conviction and wishes.   They have that right to their preferences .  Respect her and respect her family's feelings also.  There are plenty of other fish in the sea.<br>  <br>  I have a like situation but in the reverse.  Our beautiful black daughter has always gone for whites and Latins.  We have always told her that she needs to date and stay within her own race.  The whites may bed her but they can never  really appreciate her,  nor would the Latins.  Period.  Besides, we want her babies to look like her, to match and identify with each other.  <br>  <br>  She didn't listen and ran off with an ugly white boy first thing.  It wasn't long before he dumped her for a white girl, called her 'niggerette'  and asked her if she was stupid enough to really think he was going to marry her.  She had an abortion - the ugly white kid and his family just said they 'd never accept any half cast baby nor help with cost or support - and she is wiser and more respectful now of her parents wisdom.  <br>  <br>  Now, she won't even talk to white or Latin boys who try to get her.  She could have saved herself a lot of heartache and misery,<br>     Life's too short to make all the mistakes yourself, we all need to heed the advice of others and respect the wisdom of the ages.|`|bgtNYOp5aa	Yeah, it's not racist but it's just as bad. She needs to grow up and learn to know in her heart your a good guy. <br>  <br>  Don't be her friend anymore, and give her the cold shoulder. Her family needs to change. But what about your family?|`|5kYIteIHaa	No i dont think that, i just think her parents won't allow her..|`|aYVVwjBXaa	not her, it sounds as if her family is racist.|`|1QSsOAAFaa	If she's telling the truth, no. She isn't. Family is more important than dates to some people, even if the family is irrational and compliance is unnecessary. But EVEN IF she doesn't date you because you're black, that still doesn't make her a racist. It just means she doesn't prefer blacks. For example, I distrust blondes tremendously and avoid dating them at all costs. Does that make me a bigot?<br>  To elaborate: I'm straight, does that make me a sexist, because I won't date men?|`|E0xuQFFnaa	She isn't racist it sounds like her parents are and she doesn't want to hurt them. I am in no way shape or form racist but I wont date a black guy because of a bad experience with one when I was 12. It could be that something happened to her mom when she was younger, or maybe they are old fashioned.|`|Kabycj7maa	shes not shes just scared of her parents but just say to her if she has feelings for you it shouldn't matter what her parents think her love & who she choses is up to her & her only. or you could just tell her to keep it a secret from her parents.. for now?|`|PXvcypHcaa	well, my fam is the same way. I find it really ridiculous but it's not like I listen to them<br>  <br>  It really is not her that is racist it is her uncultured family.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I think she comes from a family of racists and knows better than to put you into a position where you will be judged unfairly.

I doubt it was a coincidence that you just happen to be working there. He would of went to a different club if he did not want to see you. I got a vibe that he likes you but he wants to see you again, I cant tell if hes a player or not. He is not shy, he is not sure where to take you yet... So he is not going to reply. I also vibe he actually got a little mad/jealous that did not talk to him that night. Not your fault in any factor, but hes a guy that gets jealous easy in the inside, and you will never know. I sense hes a water sign so my gut is correct. Since he was mad not paticularly at you but just at the situation at hand, He decided to "punish" you by not replying right away. He showed interest by replying back at first but he felt that jumping the ship by going back out with you right away would make him less of a man. I would reccomend for him to come back to you.

If he doesn't respond, then let it go.  However....are you sure your last message got to him?  I don't always trust texting, because some of mine don't go through, and I don't get others.  I would try communicating again if you suspect this, or, it could be a good segway to renewing the contact even if you don't ("hey, my phone's acting funny - did you get my last text?").  This way, it is non-confrontational, no pressure, and he is likely to answer either way.<br>  <br>  Take Care|`|AMrkXKV3aa	wait a couple days to see if he replies... you don't want to sound too pushy, yanno? he may not be as interested as you are, maybe he just hasn't got around to checking the message.. if he doesn't respond after about 2 days, IM him or something and say hey, but don't throw in that 'when ya taking me out mister haha?' line until you're sure he's in the same boat as you are.|`|z6RToonUaa	Chances are...he likes you.

Spent some time with a Original Saint who can give you some assistance for mental peace|`|NDueI7Zuaa	i know it always seems like things all have to happen at the same exact time. life problems pile up and seem insurmountable. thankfully, you seem like a really smart girl. if people in your life aren't treating you well, LET THEM GO. if they come back later and apologize that's good for them, but otherwise you don't really need them in your life if all they do is cause pain and drama. it is remarkably easy to spend time with nice people who are fun and won't pull you through the grinder all the time.<br>  <br>  good luck! things always get better (then worse, then better, then worse, then better). it is our crazy beautiful existence here on earth.<br>  <br>  i would also recommend dancing very highly if that's what you want to do - or create some art or write how you feel. not so much the drinking though - drinking messes with your seratonin levels and will make you feel worse in the long run, and from personal experience i can tell you that drinking while you're feeling sh***y already will lead you down a far rougher path.<br>  <br>  <3|`|T864ejaiaa	drinking is not going to make things better. it will eventually kill you. you may want to get some help. people can be mean, we have to deal with life dealing us hard blows and then we pick our self up and go on. you can always keep in touch with friends that have moved away. if this girl is a bad influence on you then you don't need her. your other friends are only trying to look out for you. i like friends like that. they have my back. but if this new friend turns out no to be a bad influence you can always try to get them all together slowly and let the get to know the new girl. good luck, life is not easy.|`|vJkEF1kPaa	ok sounds childish to me. <br>  your 2 friends have to do some serious thinking about the word friendship. BUT if they are telling you she is a bad influence on you then maybe you should listen, they are your friend. your guy friend sorry to tell u, just wanted some a$$. since you probably never gave it to him he thought he was stuck on the friend zone. you need to think who will be there for you in the long run. your friends or this one girl. if worse comes to worse you need to start cutting people loose. just cut off the people that give you stress and you'll feel better|`|1iXvphNYaa	Let it all fall apart then.

Hang in there.<br>  <br>  Friends come and go.  I know that on TV they show people who are lifelong friends who are like family, but in reality people hardly ever have this.  You have to learn to make friends and then let them drift away as your interests change or they move or they decide they don't like your friends.  Instead of trying to hang onto a best friend, get a wide circle of friends that you see.  Stay in contact when they drift away, and maybe you can renew your friendships later, but don't stress if you don't.<br>  <br>  Go out and dance.  But don't get drunk.  I know it seems like it helps, but it doesn't.  Alcohol is a depressant, and it makes you do stupid things.  Stay sober.
GaEF8k3haa	All the things you mentioned are great, but if you want to be more outgoing, a personality makeover is what you need.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, an image makeover does help you feel more confident, but that is only one of the ways.<br>  <br>  1. Work on making yourself look approachable and friendly, using body language<br>  <br>  2. Talk to people, even if they are the kind you would normally not talk to. Looks are often deceptive, and you may end up with a great activity partner or a best-pal or even a girlfriend!<br>  <br>  3. Learn something that you're the best at. This will make people come up and ask you for help.<br>  <br>  4. Take up new responsibilities: in your school student council, or start a club, or stand for election. You won't believe how many cool people you will meet.<br>  <br>  All the best! I'm sure you'll do great! :)|`|z6RToonUaa	Some ways you can look more outgoing is simply by body language! Move your hands when you are speaking, and have an open stance (your feet are pointing in opposite directions) Most communication is made through your body, not words. Do not cross your arms ever when talking, this can be miss read as cutting off a conversation. Do not stand too stiff, just relax. Make sure your voice is smooth and calm while talking. Overall, this will make you a much more outgoing person!|`|L7GH0SjAaa	Join the Drama club!<br>  Super Fun!

Make sure that what you express on the outside is a reflection of what you have an affinity to or passion for on the inside.  Do not let what you look like be solely influenced by what you think the high school kids want to see.  Make it your own - make it art. <br>  <br>  I think the best way to do this, if you have not already, is take some time to design in your head the ideal "you", but not just on the outside.  Be sure to include honorable characteristics like integrity, as well as a smokin' bod.<br>  <br>  Take Care|`|3EM66IWFaa	your not in a position to change any thing. Be there where you are.
hHAdA9V9aa	I would try talk to your friend first, maybe send her a text or note because you shouldn't really talk to a teacher you trust, which would be your best port of call, without her knowing. It could ruin your friendship and she'll defo need one right now.<br>  <br>  Also, consider what would happen if it turned out to be true. Alot of changes will go on in her life - do you really think she'd be better off in the hands of the state?<br>  <br>  Talk to her first - make her aware she can get help and that they're there for her but don't force her to do anything.|`|FgKecGFtaa	do whatever you can to help her<br>  <br>  FIRST: just ask her flat out it might be nice for her to talk about it<br>  <br>  SECOND: if she has younger brothers or sister that may be why she is not telling anyone if they get taken from their dad they might be slip up<br>  <br>  THIRD: you need to know if you do report this she may have to move......with foster parents and away from you.........<br>  <br>  so just talk to her about it if she's about 16 then it wont be long before she can get out but make sure that reporting him wont make her life worse...i know that sounds stupid but really|`|XHkruFkqaa	If you told your parents what is going on I think they would let you use the phone for that.

I say call some one immediately!!! the sooner the better.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	You need to call social services (you can be anonymous) & next time she is all beat up you need to go to a pay phone call the police and say you wish to stay anonymous & explain that she looks like she has been beat.  They can file a report and social services can step in and do surprise visits etc..|`|00sn8G9paa	You've already seen enough signs. Call the Police.|`|GzBkproMaa	By the signs you have suggested, it does seem like she is being abused by her father. No child deserves this, and I think the best thing you can do is tell your parents about it, so they can take action towards it...that will also open up the phone line for you. You have to talk to your parents, so you can help your friend. If not your parents, than any adult that you trust, even a teacher. Your friend will thank you later, even if she doesn't appreciate it right then.<br>  Good Luck!|`|YbwDFvEaaa	This is really something you need to bring to the attention of your parents/guardian or a school councilor. You need their support in order to properly assess the situation and help your friend in the way that is best for her. Even in the event that her father isn't abusing her, it's clear something is wrong...no one should be bruised up as often as you're suggesting.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and best wishes to your friend.|`|kRbkiPvnaa	Talk to your parents and explain that you are concerned for your friends safety. Ask them to call child protective services and report the possibility of abuse before it's too late.  It's better to do something and be wrong than to do nothing and be correct about her abuse.|`|oFUqegjfaa	All of the signs are there. Google "child services".

Vp1Wzu07aa	Best thing you can do is learn from this! Do not ever try to intervene yourself.<br>  <br>  Unless you want to call the police while they are fighting, there is nothing that you can do if your mom won't cooperate. That is not to say that if you call the police during an active fight and they show up, if your mom has marks on her, even if she doesn't want to press charges, they will arrest your dad and press charges themselves. But it won't stop your dad from beating your mom if she doesn't want to leave him. <br>  <br>  My dad used to hit my mom on occaision and I used to have to listen from my bedroom. Fortunately, my mom didn't put up with this abuse for long and she left him. This experience certainly taught me how I should be treated by a man. Luckily I was strong enough to be able to break the cycle.<br>  <br>  Experts say that a kid who witnesses abuse most likely grow up to be an abuser himself or a wife who is abused. They say that because it is common that a child who is raised perceives their family to be normal. If that family is disfunctional, that child learns the bad behaivior and is likely to repeat it.<br>  <br>  If your mother will not help herself, you can keep pushing. Tell her that no one desreves to be hit...no matter what they do. Try to show her that there is a better place for you. It took my mom a while to be able to get us out of our environment, but just the fact that knowing she didn't think it was normal or acceptable, helped me form my opinions about abusive men. Maybe you can plead with your mom and explain that this not only affects her but affects you as well, then ask her if she doesn't feel that you deserve better.|`|tFoSy2YRaa	On a day when your mum is home but your father is away, sit her down and make her a have a long talk with you. Tell her exactly how you feel about it, and how you know she doesn't deserve to be hit. It sounds like she's in complete denial - she is probably depressed that her husband, and the father of her child has turned out to be like this, and he is controlling her. Tell her you love her and if you both have to leave you'll be ok. If she refuses to listen tell her so to the police. These situations can end up really bad, it has to stop now. <br>  Good luck, hope everything turns out alright, and make sure your parents' mistakes don't ruin your own life.|`|MtbaNz5Yaa	Don't look to your dad as an example of how to treat women or anyone else for that matter.<br>    What he is doing is called domestic abuse and is a criminal offense.<br>   Your mother is suffering from low self esteem and thinks that she is a bad person and believes that she is lucky to have any man.|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Report his A**, and if you have decent cops they will give him a taste of his own medicine.<br>  If not I have another Idea but I cannot post it I this fine website.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Your poor mum, she thinks this because your dad has completely destroyed her self confidence and her belief in herself.  <br>  <br>  If you are in England or Wales you can contact Woman's Aid and someone will be able to give you advice and help.<br>  <br>  Good luck your mum will need a lot of support to leave your dad x|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	you have to tell someone.

This is a good thing. But if it is more prevalent than good conversation and sharing of life experience, than he is not a 'good friend'.. yet.<br>  He should contribute at least as much to your life, through emotional support (just listening) as he does in advice and interest in the rest of your life (genuine concern with what you are concerned with).<br>  You didn't mention if you are already friendly with this subject or you are considering befriending him'. I presumed the first but it would still apply. Your mileage may vary depending on whether you are a good 'girly friend' ;) <br>  Good Luck

I had small eyes with folds that were barely noticeable, a flat broad nose and lips that didn't pop out. People thought I was cute but I always saw myself as awkward looking. I was also really short and not well-developed for awhile. My other relatives developed early and looked like themselves (as they look similar now) when they were children while I didn't. When I was 15, I finally began to develop, I grew up to 5'3, my facial features became proportional and since I grew into my nose, my lips suddenly looked very full. ALL WITHOUT surgery, just by puberty and growing up! I even had a ton of baby fat but lost it when I was around 18 years old.

His girlfriend dumped him after she found out.  Now you're wondering if she should ask him out?  Do you really want your 'dear friend' to date this guy?  Really?  He's not exactly a prize catch, is he?  It's not your or my choice.  She has to make her own decision.  But I voted 'Hell NO!!!'|`|feb0df556be60b6ae1592e3a13327aedaa	She should ask him out..why wait, NEW YEAR, NEw REALTIOIONSHIP, well this should help her out....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be in the right place. It's best to ask someone out in person, so you've got to make sure to be where the guy you have a crush on is. This could be at the mall, the movies, or maybe at the baseball field if he's an athlete. You don't want to look like a stalker, but you do want to be able to talk to him. <br>  Take the intiative. Unfortunately, many guys are too afraid to walk up to a girl and ask her out. Take matters into your own hands. Walk up to him slowly and introduce yourself. Try not to do this if he's extremely busy, but at the same time, don't let the opportunity to talk to him pass you by just because you're nervous. If he seems receptive when you introduce yourself, keep on talking to him. <br>  Make small talk with him. Break the ice by commenting on something he's wearing or saying something about the place or event you're at. Just try to get him to feel comfortable around you. <br>  Make eye contact with him. While the two of you are talking, make eye contact and try to hold it for just a little longer than you normally would--just two or three seconds. If he makes eye contact back, he's probably interested in you. Make sure he's not looking at you because you're doing something extremely weird or because he is the cashier. <br>  Commence flirting. This can mean touching him lightly on the arm, for example, or laughing at his jokes. Just be playful and communicate that you're interested. Sometimes you can flirt from afar and entice him to come over to you. <br>  Ask him non-intrusive questions about himself, such as what kinds of things he likes to do, what his favorite kind of food is, or if he likes to play sports. By asking harmless little questions you can find out more about him to determine if you really want to ask him out, and you might find out if he has a girlfriend. You can also set the conversation up to ask him out. <br>  Ask him out. Once you find something you both have in common, ask if he'd like to do it together sometime. If you don't succeed in finding something you have in common, you might not really find him that interesting, but if you want to take a chance, just let him know that you'd like to hang out with him again.<br>  <br>  <br>  If he says no, or if he seems like he needs more time, don't get too upset; always say you can just be friends if that's what he wants. Chances are, he'll change his mind. Guys do this a lot. Whatever you do, don't trash him to others; it makes you look bad. <br>  If he says yes, then plan where and when you will go out, and don't forget to have fun. Since you asked, you should pay for the date, unless he insists.|`|AA11981521	I'm not sure what "all he's been through", besides fooling around with someone else and getting dumped by another girl.

No mi cuate, cuando amas es sentirte tan en confianza y tan agusto como estar encuerado, como llegar a tu casa, te comunicas y expresas todo lo que te gusta y te disgusta, sin complejos, porque a lo mejor no te entiendenden pero si te aceptan.Comportándote así , tu tampoco eres buena gente. y por eso a los dos a?os estás que ya no aguantas.|`|E66qKIIKaa	bien por ti<br>  yo andava en una situacion parecida<br>  solo que me di cuenta antes de hacerla mi novia,salimos y todo pero cuando me cayo el veinte mejor dije hasta aqui, ella se enojo conmigo y me dejo de hablar pero es preferible andar como tonto|`|Etl8JMcnaa	No creo que te quiera, no se ve que te respete.|`|HvvGkmM8aa	ah ya no te ardas mano!!!<br>  al fin y al cabo estaba gorda!!!<br>  ya sabes que no falta quien les mueva las carnes<br>  acuerdate que son las viejas ..abronas!!<br>  <br>  hiciste bien a la goma!!! nada mas andaba buscando quien la llevara, quien la trajera y quien le pagara!!!|`|RQjA9spnaa	Bueno, tal ves es solo amiguera?? pero si a ti te molesta su actitud no trates de cambiarla, seria un error porque ella <br>  dejaria de ser quien es y perdería su esencia y si tu aceptas de alguien algo que no te gusta, tu estarías perdiendo tu esencia.  y ninguno seria feliz. Aun estas a tiempo de encontrar a una chica que se acomode mas a tu gusto ... Suerte!!<br>  Un consejo que aunque no son muy útiles ahí va...

Amar implica valorar al otro por lo que es. Si te casaste con él, es porque viste algo en él que nadie mas vió (a tiempo por lo menos). Por lo que contas él esta pasando por un momento difícil, mas que terapia creo que tiene que ver un psicólogo que lo ayude. Tal vez, si te dan las fuerzas, proponele que vean juntos lo que el ve, que te cuente, que se exprese, que diga lo que siente.

Parece que estás confundida y no sólo por las "ciber-actividades" de tu pareja, también te confunde la idea del "triunfo o fracaso" de tu matrimonio.<br>  <br>  Lo más importante es que identifiques ?qué es lo que quieres?, para de ahí partir...<br>  <br>  Algo triste de la vida real, es que los hombres no cambiamos en nuestra forma de ser, podemos modificar nuestras actividades durante un periodo, pero nuestra forma de ser está implícita.... posiblemente tu marido haya sido así cuando lo conociste y con el tiempo te diste cuenta, entonces sería algo "injusto" querer modificar algo que ya existía antes de conocerte. Ahora bien que si el amor de tu marido por tí, es lo suficientemente grande, puede modificar esa actitud, pero para ello tienes que ser firme en lo que pides y no doblar las manos, sobretodo si amenazas y no cumples es igual o peor que si el promete y no cumple. DIALOGO sobretodo, pues es una actividad que podría ser de lo más natural, como fantasear con tu actor favorito, mientras haces el amor con tu marido... pero cuando afecta ya la relación entre ustedes hay que hablarlo, de frente, directa y firmemente.<br>  <br>  Pero repito, para llegar a este punto debes conocer qué otros puntos están débiles en tu relación, que han hecho que pase por tu mente el "irte".<br>  <br>  Y lo de los hijos, tienes toda la razón, mientras no estén estables, lo mejor es que todavía no lleguen.<br>  <br>  Salud...os.!!!|`|3d4c8e359148ccd9ae33a0347c0582dbaa	Saludos. En mi opinión debes dialogar con tu esposo sobre la situación que describes porque no es normal este comportamiento. Si él acepta que está mal, sería necesario que busque ayuda profesional. Con relación a tu estado anímico debes acudir, al igual que tu esposo, a buscar ayuda para poder lidiar con esta situación. Una vez culminado este proceso, si persiste esta problemática, debes autoanalizarte y determinar que deseas para ti. La decisión es tuya.|`|4958043b103484bcded6825cbbbf29eeaa	Mira lo que voy a contarte te parecera novela, pero es verdad, cuando te casas, segun las leyes de Dios, es para siempre, si no le pediste direccion a Dios para hacerlo, por lo regular pasa lo que te esta sucediendo, pero El siempre te escuchara si tu le eres fiel, pidele que te ayude, que te de fortaleza para resistir, y que ayude a tu matrimonio, a que tu marido cambie, no es facil, pero si confias y sabes esperar, te aseguro que vas a obtener una respuesta, cuando tu te casas, segun la Biblia, que para mi es la palabra de Dios, dice que se convierte en una sola carne, en uno solo, asi que tus defectos son de el, y los de el son tuyos, ora, vela, clama a Dios, el separarte no te lleva a nada, te lo aseguro, no esperes el verte separada para entender lo que es una divorciada y para lo que te van a buscar, puede pasar mucho tiempo para que veas una respuesta, pero te garantizo que si en verdad buscas a Dios como tu guia, vas a tener exelentes resultados, y un dia le vas a decir a otra persona lo que yo te digo hoy, Dios es real, solo te esta esperando a que lo buques, El te ama, solo toca la puerta y te abrira.|`|5c9c40881f27f68189e12e79422e0f40aa	Mina antes que nada espero que estes bien, y desde mi punto de ver las cosas lo tuyo no es un gran problema y mucho menos como para pensar en el divorcio ya que es una forma de ser de tu marido y si tu no la compartes no sesesariamente el esta mal, por el contrario considero es un grito de desesperacion posiblemente a el le haga falta alguna cosa en el matrimonio, como por ejemplo algun tipo de fantasia que si tu no la cumples no dudes que el lo busque por otro lado. <br>  Creo que no es malo, solo que es importante saber de tus principios y educacion pero lo que les hace falta a uds es COMUNICACION. para saber que piensa el, porque lo hace y si esta interesado en cumplir alguna fantasia contigo. Esto los unira mas como matrimonio y rompera con la monotonia, por otro lado no prestes mucha atencion pero el lo seguira haciendo, y eso no lo convierte en un mounstro ni nada por el estilo como para pensar el no estar con el. Yo te puedo decir que de todas las cosas que creemos malas o no van con nuestra forma de ser, podemos sacar provecho y convertirlas en algo positivo y maravilloso .....solo falta saber que tan dispuesta estas tu a ser feliz.<br>  Solo por citarte un ejemplo: si tienes una hija que esta en la puvertad, y ya quiere tener novio se lo prohibes, la respuesta es no?..`piensa que de todas formas lo va a hacer solo que ahora a escondidas ya que no cuenta con tu aprovacion, ya se que vas a pensar que sera algun pervertido el pretendiente que posiblemente piensa en violar a tu peque?a.... pero no lo sabras si no te das la oportunidad y en este caso lo unico que puedes hacer es educar y tener comunicacion para ense?arle a cuidarse, a observar las intenciones de la gente. Y tu lo puedes utilizar en tu beneficio.. ?puede tener novio siempre y cuando este exelente en la escuela, y podra salir con el bajo la supervicion de un adulto (tu) y de esa forma lejos de formarle un capricho la motivas. Piensa de igual forma lo va a hacer.<br>  En el caso de tu marido es tu decicion pero piensa usalo en tu beneficio o que lo haga a escondidas, de todos modos lo va a hacer...piensalo y toma una desision. no te digo que hacer solo expongo mi punto de vista.|`|77172e5554f0b9ed1dbcb48ea859b1c2aa	Deberian de asistir a terapia de pareja si el no cambia y eso te hace da?o tal vez lo mejor es separase no puedes vivir asi animo todo tiene solucion solo es cuestion de no quedarse con los brazos cruzados|`|8fef394eca06627769d0adb2533d237daa	creo q esta pasando por una situacion muy critica en cuanto a deseos sexual se refiere, el hecho de q este obsesoionado con la pornografia es dificil. quizas le falte moitivos para exitarse mas, habla con el y dile q esta bien q vea portnografia q lo entiendes q es por aumentar su imaginaciuon sexual, pero q no anteponga el sexo a su relacion de pareja, q la vida de matrimonio se basa de amor y cari?o y todo lo demas q si quiere sexo esta bien pero primero es el amor.... trata de ayudarlo porq para eso son esposos para ayudarse mutuamente..<br>  <br>  espero te ayude mi comentario y suerte.|`|b511abc4dfc1a96fc368b774805b4d83aa	pues, es dificil juzgar desde aqui,pero,creo q si los dos, como se ve, usan e utilizan el internet, deberian usar esta herramineta a su favor y tenerla como motivo de conflicto, no crees?|`|c7038536cf0f674d6f32389fbeacf880aa	si ya trataste todo y no cambia dejalo  y busca una  persona  q en realidad te  valore y no te utilice  como  un  objeto  busca un hombre q  en realidad  te meresca  y te valore   es dificil  pero  no  imposible  te    suerte  bye|`|d135816dc82cf75446ffea31e47fcba3aa	Dejalo de una vez a ese enfermo,y contacta-me ,que yo te voy hacer feliz|`|eea25e70e4ac9c46041a1be20b07786eaa	creo que no debes seguirlo aguantando pues te stas irrespetando a si misma al dejarte llenar de cuentos separate de el ademas n tienen hijos pues no hay nada de que preocuparse...

WaYC7W9Haa	Honey you should have mentioned to your girlfriend in the begining that you were diggin him.  Now that they've been on a few dates and not sure what happened on them.  I would totally be cordual with him.  Learn how to be aggressive if someone is peeping you and you are feeling them do something to acknowledge that and step up to the plate.  When are living in a different time and men love it when they encounter aggressive women.  Sometimes they can't handle it and shy away but be assertive in a nice way.<br>  <br>  Your girlfriend will look at you a bit differently when you bring it up I can almost asure this!

Sorry.|`|8i7AEWRCaa	she is your best friend. he dosent like u thats obviouse so get over him and dont talk to your friend about it. he dosent worth it|`|8LUm74jvaa	i am srry but  u arent supposed to fight for a guy!<br>  i mean she is ur best friend|`|4sNC5io8aa	If she is your best friend than you should sit her down and ask her first, how does she feel about him since she went out on two dates with him.<br>  And if she says she is not interested in him, tell her since she is not than how would she feel about you asking him out.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with a girl asking a guy out but she was your best friend first so out of respect for her ask her.|`|ajQYu3TCaa	First thing you do is ask your friend. if she tells you its ok then tell this guy that you like him. talk to him more often and let him know when you are available,... wait for him to ask you out. if he likes you then he will ask you out, but dont wait forever, there are other nice guys out there too. hope it works out.|`|yuRT8QKZaa	wait n watch carefully lovey, u sure he's only looking at u, r u sure he only dances with u...if these are all a big YES, then u need to ask ur frnd how she feels abt him. if she likes him like u, i think its best to forget abt it. if it wz just a joke 4 her, tell her ur feelings and in no time, u'll b goin out with him.|`|Zp7q5ZjXaa	Maybe you could start off asking your friend how she feels about the guy. That way you wont have to tell her that you like him if she does.If she likes him well, shes your friend and she acted first so you should step down and let her be happy. I really hope this helps. Good luck.|`|EdidZdtlaa	you should talk to your friend and find out if she likes him. talk to her about him and stuff and ask him who he likes or find out who he likes:ither you or your friend.|`|AA11108018	If your worried about you friend go to her and ask her if there is anything going on between them.  If not make your move if so back off|`|Oejricveaa	Ask her in a round about way if she likes him or if she is dating him or if she talks to him alot.<br>  <br>  If its no and she just did it for fun than if I were you I would go for it. <br>  Next time you are out talk to him more or mention you both should hang out together or grab dinner somewhere.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	hmmm i think u know more than what ur telling us here..more likely u have the feeling she likes him..and if that is soo its not nice for u two come between them two.. give it time and see what happens between them.. if she isnt interested or he..u might have a chance.. but wait.. let time decide what  will happen..good luck|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Yona, Yona, Yona,<br>  <br>  Ask him what he thinks of you and how the two of you relate to one another.

DFSHoO4uaa	well i think she has a boyfriend! or a male friend she properly doesn't want you 2 know about it best thing 2 do is show her your there for her and she can tell you anything and you won't judge her, hope everything is ok take care!|`|EdidZdtlaa	she might have a new boyfriend that she met in london or something. you should ask her about it.|`|PXfUyd5aaa	She's actually...HANNA MONTANA!!!!!!|`|AA11108018	Seems she visited more just your Aunt.  I would say she met some one who is older than her.  I based this on the fact your either a working guy making loads of money or a thief.  I don't know to many young guy who wear a rolex watch.  So keep watch on her but don't get to deep because she might just start sneaking around|`|uLHtXibRaa	B/F|`|Kvajun9yaa	maybe she is having an affair with a married man from london!|`|WNhQzmo3aa	Sounds like a guy, and from the reaction to the touching of the watch sounds like she really likes him. But what 16 year old gives another 16 year old a ROLEX WATCH? That seems suspicious! I think you should look into it. See what your baby sister is hiding. It may be someone way older than her. Who knows or maybe its a rich 16 year old kid who really likes her too....<br>  <br>  But its better to be save than sorry, find out exactly who the mystery caller is.|`|0ZyHN4Taaa	I can tell you exactly what it is. She has a person that is all in her business, and resorting to Yahoo! Answers to get even deeper into her business. <br>  <br>  All we need to do is eliminate the nosy threat from her life, and she will have no more problems.|`|CaRKCpMqaa	A sugar daddy?<br>  ha no, probably found herself a guy up in London but is too embarrsed to talk about it atm, give her anothr little while and see what happens, try talking to her to, sister to sister.<br>  Good luck|`|ZQdn9xMPaa	Oh come on....you know what shes hiding. A BOY duh!! Youve been her age what is the one thing that got you giddie like that.|`|X6ADjE1laa	Drug-trafficking|`|Sm0rYAnCaa	She has a new, wealthy boyfriend and she doesn't want you to know about it!|`|6vyWV0R6aa	she hiding a boyfriend in london|`|R0sfHEX4aa	I don't know. she's probably paranoid about something! Try to talk to her about it and see what happens. :)|`|IhZeoXqvaa	Well, I would start off by telling her that you respect whatever relationship she may or may not be involved in.  I doubt it is really much of anything, I am very protective of my things (whether they were bought by me or someone else), especially expensive ones.  Maybe ask her about it, and don't accuse her of anything.  Just talk to her and make her feel like you support her and care about her.  Then if you find out it is something weird like an old man or something, tell her how unhealthy it is and talk to your/her parents.|`|epgMbc4Vaa	Maybe, when she went to london, she met a boy and she doesn't want your family to know about him, is she allowed to date? maybe she's hiding it from your parents.Who knows, why don't you try asking her? if she doesn't want to tell you, I would stay out of her business, she may get angry.|`|Zp7q5ZjXaa	It sounds to me like she met someone in london. Like a boyfriend. The rolex watch makes me pretty certain that if it is a boyfriend he's probably older. Since shes twelve i think that if anything else comes up that points to her being with an older man your parents should get involved. Have you asked your aunt?|`|5lUSWvXhaa	Instead if sneaking around asking the internet, be honest with her, take her into a room alone and ask her to tell you. Don't rush her though. I think she will tell, you're her older sister after all.|`|oDLdqrJfaa	Obviously at least you met a guy she liked......at best she had sex with a guy she met in London. Women/ especially 16 year old girls get loose when they don't got their kin/peer network friends social circle to find out they slept with some guy.....and make them look cheap. So when they are on vacation they are super easy.|`|II8duVtMaa	if your close ask her, she might not want the parents to know, but might want you advise! <br>  its obs to do with a boy, what else would it be. the watch and running are signs. :)|`|gJPlY1ADaa	I would say your sister met a boy in London....she is in puppy love, my guess is the watch was a gift from the guy and she really likes him but yea that is what she is hiding ...A BOY!!|`|rh5vbol9aa	Probably she has already IMPULSES!|`|q1EDNQhBaa	She met a guy, The watch is a forget me not! Its him calling and texting!|`|rM9Oqy68aa	She probably met a guy and wants to keep it a secret.|`|PDAVQU3Caa	it seems she met someone in london.|`|OtbbKdITaa	It sounds like she has a love interest.|`|GsRpZJX5aa	duhhh she has someone back in london|`|WvIDTs4Paa	a boy

I guess the fact they can't communicate is another good reason for them to break up, just as good a reason as they don't sleep together.

WaYC7W9Haa	This question is ask all the time.<br>  <br>  Women tend to date multiple men if their not in a serious relationship to enjoy the moment with that person.  Sponsors we call it! Sponsor a meal, movie or concert.  The man that seems to splurg the most is the one we choose to stick with because it seems he has the $$$$$!<br>  <br>  However; this doesn't mean that he was the right one.  Men screw around with different women all the time but when a woman does it, it becomes contradictary!  We sometime catch feelings faster then men but we know how to protect ourselves go home and think nothing of it most of the time.<br>  <br>  It's all fun and living life!|`|kQA2wgaKaa	I tried Match for a period of time.  I never slept with any of the men I went out with but did date a couple of them (going to dinner or drinks) a few times each before I decided we weren't right for one another.  Usually, it only takes one date though and then I know if it's someone I want to see more.  Once I decide that, I'm not the kind of person who can date more than one person at a time... it's just confusing.<br>  <br>  Men (or women) who date multiple people at a time, I believe have commitment issues.  That's just me.|`|dEb85e07aa	i wouldn't now because i haven't done it...|`|EcI03UPUaa	some girl's don't they just keep it going|`|CaRKCpMqaa	I've done it once, never again ..|`|v96pYAg1aa	2% of the woman population go out with multiple men

You can't fall in real love in a minute. She really likes you if she's your girlfriend, she just doesn't love you yet, and why would she say something she doesn't mean? Don't rush her emotions.|`|rRWubfNNaa	shes not ready to tell you that she loves you. i used to do it all the time with my boyfriend until i actually ment it and it took me a while to figure it out, just be patient with her.|`|m2WGmGXjaa	she doesn't love you obviously and she doesn't wanna lie.<br>  <br>  She probably just needs more time, because "I love you" Is a big thing!|`|lzo4tOQvaa	how long have you 2 been dating ? its either that or said it WAY to early.|`|WvIDTs4Paa	she does'nt love you.|`|Gd9GKvXbaa	just kept telling her she will come around|`|Vkf3dpdraa	well how long has it been for you being together? because i been told those 3 little words after well few days.its kind of weird perhaps but if you feel it in your heart sure that its love and not lust. maybe the girl feels its way too soon and is scared of saying those words with out meaning it. sure you can love someone but are you head over heels over them in love is another thing.give her time im sure she will come around and tell you I? U!|`|NcAAqe9Iaa	usually that means she doesn't love you anymore. just stop saying it to her and see how she acts. or if you don't wanna do that just ask her why she never says it back.|`|Jsxv8WUsaa	Maybe she isn't ready to say it yet... I love you is a very strong sentence to anyone...it'll take time but don't back down!

Fmwd8ykiaa	Can I trade lives with you? That sounds a lot easier than mine.<br>  My dad should be going to jail but keeps evading the law. He has broken into my me and my mom's apartment, beating the crap out of my mom's boyfriend, breaking his nose and a lot of stuff. Tried to rape my mom and has hit my mom and me plus he has my little brother who I love so much. I haven't seen him in like a month and a half. I have no friends where I live except my boyfriend and his friends. But I mean we can both look on the bright side of things. For me it is the fact that I am going away to college soon. For you it may be your grades! :)|`|Wrn6WH7xaa	Be grateful for your two great friends. I'd say most people only get one great friend. <br>  <br>  As for your parents getting a divorce, thats tough. But maybe now they won't fight as much, and might get a second chance at love, which everyone deserves. :-)|`|fox5a3ePaa	Unfortunately theres not much you can do about your parents situation just try and stay close to both of them without taking sides. As for people calling you names because you are clever, that is because they are jealous|`|MWE7rQ4Daa	Get a bag of weed|`|6d0iJ4RQaa	First off, what you have to do is step back, take a breath, and collect your thoughts.  You have to realize the situation, find out exactly what is going on.  The second thing you have to do is learn to accept the situation because if your parents are getting divorced, then A.  it is not your fault, B. If two grown adults make a conscious decision to separate then that is their decision.  I understand when your parents get divorced, it is never an easy situation, its as if your entire childhood is falling apart, but you have to realize something, if your parents fight the way they do, then maybe it is for the best.  Look for your friends for shoulders when you need to cry, and live life.  Remember your parents divorce does not end your life, it is just a large pothole that you are unable to drive around.  The point is in life, there are good times, and there are bad, work through this bad point in your life, and learn to cope in a mature manner.  Be there for your mom and dad if they need you because even though they are getting divorced, their love for you will not be any less, I can promise you that.  Be strong.|`|YM3jlriXaa	aww hiya x<br>  <br>  well if your friends are being right goby cows the forget them im sure you have other friends you could mix with  x<br>  <br>  ohh and being clever is talented x<br>  <br>  if your mum and dad is arguing the on your mostley with and trust then tell one of your parent that your scared everyday theyll understand <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  xoxo luv you xoxo|`|qv6C4kQraa	About the friends being cows things I always look at friendship this way.<br>  <br>  20% Of friends are going to be really close to you, you can tell them anything.<br>  <br>  40% Of friends you are going to be friendly with but not too friendly in a Best Friend Way.<br>  <br>  20% Of people wont like you. But that's life.|`|SuOfRTXzaa	All parents argue, perhaps they will work through their problems. As for your friends cherish them 2 is better than none.  As for being clever GOOD FOR U, you might not see it that way now but once you leave school and get a good job you will have the last laugh.|`|jD1JY0BJaa	Ride it out. At least you've still got a couple of good mates. It's not the end of the world if your parents do get divorced. Mine are and I still managed to be happy.|`|7cUDstdjaa	Find a decent, caring  friend, male or female, that you can share your feelings with.<br>  Put all your trouble aside and concentrate on something that makes YOU happy.<br>  You're the one who's important here, and right now.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Don't add to your parents problems. Go clean your room, close the door, and be quiet. Don't beg for anything you know they can afford to buy you. When you are done with your room, go on to the bathroom. Keep going. It will keep you busy and your mind busy. You will help the stress at home and it's a good thing to do. Smile and be nice. It may just rub off on your quarreling parents.
EIK4TaWoaa	When we really like somebody the last thing we want to is to look stupid in front of them. <br>  <br>  I married the woman I love, we've been together forever, normally I'm a pretty extroverted character and yet I still have moments of real back to high school, stuttering, blushing, "I'm so embarrassed" shyness. <br>  <br>  Over time most people get less self conscious, life has a million ways of teaching you to chill out and have some prospective about what is and isn't important.<br>  <br>  Being cool with yourself makes things easier but when the other person's opinion of you really counts -the shyness never totally goes away. Just trust yourself and if you're lucky you might find the right person where in their eyes you can do no wrong.|`|u8MOrhnvaa	Because you really like him and you're afraid to reveal the real you to him out of fear that he'll reject you.|`|Re8MqVNkaa	just tell him exactly what u just told me, he'll think its sweet ^.~|`|QODJNf1oaa	omg, I used to be the same way when I was in highschool, and to this day I still am kind of like that in the beginning of relationships.

I'm sure it's because you really like him - and you don't want to make a fool of yourself in front of him & online you can obv. hide parts of your personality that you wouldn't want him to see. Next time your in school when you walk by him say something really sly..like "wow, u must be glad to see me today, huh?" and he will absolutely love it & in his head he'll be thinking about you all day.

It sounds dorky, but it's better if they're in the loop with these kinds of things, trust me.<br>  Because I don't know you and I don't know him I can't say whether he's too old for you but I think you should trust your gut. :]|`|Ih6Bgggsaa	age depends on your maturity, how comfortable you feel being with an older guy and how your parents feel.<br>  <br>  if you both have a similar mature stage (like he is a little childish and you act a little older than your age) then thats a good sign.<br>  If you arent embarrassed with your age and he isnt embarrased with yours then its also all good.<br>  the worse thing are your parents, if they are ok with you going out with a boy who is 2 years older than you then i say go for it.<br>  <br>  remember AGE IS JUST A NUMBER!|`|hnmF2wvYaa	yes he is to old for you..i have seen many relationships like this..and they all ended badly..<br>  1. i see a trend of older guys always cheating on there younger girlfriends..guys typically pic younger girls because they think they can get away with being unfaithful<br>  2. pretty soon he is going to want to have sex..now once he turns 18 its against the law and if you guys get caught then its over for him<br>  3. there is just to much of a difference in age|`|MRyv5E5waa	Well I dont think it is a big deal!

That would've been illegal then, but now they're older so it doesn't seem as much of a difference!|`|uIUXpteMaa	no he is not that old as such..<br>  its ohkay u really love him???<br>  and so do he ???<br>  all what matters is do u both love each other ...<br>  and really he is not old for u 2 years gap is okay!!!<br>  dont think much its alright... be happy <br>  enjoy :)|`|OWqz9EuFaa	na. when i was 12 i dated a 15 yo. whats wrong is my friend who when she was 11 dated a 23 yo. sooooooooooooooooooo wrong right there. you're fine, babe.|`|f3a69d4445ff73558288c867d72cb3f8aa	no... my closest guy friend is 17, and so is my boyfriend... we never felt the age difference..<br>  look at it this way: a sophomore and a junior!! doesnt sound as bad, rite? :))|`|MqoOPi9Xaa	Just imagine yourself dating a random 11 year old that you know and ask yourself if thats weird. If its weird to you, then you definetly shouldnt go out with that guy,|`|kWKZoQogaa	No; that's a little more than a two year gap. Not too bad at all.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	yes|`|vqUA37yvaa	no i don't see any problem with it! it's not as if you're 14 & he's 32...then i'd be worried!!|`|j0mI8l07aa	Your biggest problem is that in a year it's going to be ILLEGAL for him to have sex with you. So he's going to either have to wait until you turn 18 unless you guys keep it an ABSOLUTE SECRET. The sad truth is even if you guys are completely happy together, some uppity relative or "friend" could still have him thrown in jail. When you are adults though, 2 and a half years is nothing. When you're both adults, it'll seem like you're pretty much the same age.|`|wck4MHREaa	Nah, it shouldn't be too big a deal; there's not too much an age gap there. Just don't do stuff you shouldn't be doing...you know.<br>  <br>  But...why don't you meet a nice guy your age instead? It'd be so much easier, you know?|`|PbFL8jh2aa	I'm turning sixteen this year and I have a major crush on this guy who's seventeen/eighteen.

It may not seem so when your older but at this age when your still growing, it seems like a big difference.|`|FB1f9zguaa	Ahh to me..not really..cuz i like a girl,who is just going to turn 15 in few days and i am 17...but who cares...dont mind other ppl..Age is just a number.|`|N7gOE1btaa	If you don't care then why are you asking?  Clearly you care and deep down think its going to be tough because at your ages, age gaps are substantial.|`|u9GQRbhvaa	I don't think it's bad, just don't do ANYTHING other than maybe make out lightly.|`|FUlvx89eaa	no the age gap isnt too bad. just dont do anything illegal or something.|`|Rfrc80Hqaa	thats only a 2 year difference, it's not that bad; no.|`|xufESx85aa	Not in my opinion.|`|XVj1SleAaa	thats only about 1.5 years (my dad and his gf are 17 years apart)|`|7xCfyZDpaa	Nahh just take it slow and you are both on the safe side!|`|ziw77iuPaa	no not bad at all....|`|EPDi4Z1Iaa	no, not at all. its just two years difference.|`|PDuaJlngaa	girl thats screwed up|`|ayM5TlcXaa	its ok. i kno a guy who is dating a gir that is 17 years younger than him

WILL impact your love relationship at one point. <br>  <br>  People with low self-esteem issues will always have some conflict that will compromise their relationship. The best bet is to discover what is driving this self-destructive image behavior? <br>  <br>  If you care about your relationship and want it to last, I might suggest finding out what is up with the neg attitude about yourself via counseling.<br>  <br>  Obviously the person with you doesn't see you in that neg way.

I honestly don't know. I wish I had the answer. :P|`|AA11324847	My HONEST thoughts? I think a healthy relationship makes you a better person, and everyone who loves to just shrug you off and "oh you'll find it one day I promise" honestly couldn't give a ****. Granted, you have to have some kind of baseline respect or whatnot for yourself yes, but I believe the REASON two people are supposed to be together is to help each other, not feed off each others weaknesses. I used to think as a teen and young adult that I was craving a relationship, when I now realize what I burn for is true fulfillment with myself despite everybody else. That's what I pray for every chance I get. The ability to ACCEPT myself and my flaws, it's very hard and it's driven me to do some crazy things in that search for love of myself. The hardest thing is to accept your own weaknesses and shortcomings.|`|OWqz9EuFaa	im not exactly sure what you are asking. but ill just tell you that ive been in a relationship where we loved each other dearly. we knew exactly what we wanted. we had everything personally, and then we had had each other. i didn't believe in perfection until i met him. i believe that you cannot love anyone until you love yourself. i achieved inner fulfillment at a very young age (13), and found my soul mate at an even younger age (12). it sounds impossible, i know. but at different ages there are different types of love. if id fallen in love with him now instead of last year i would love him differently then i did then, and same for if i was 30. so, no, ive not found inner fulfillment BEFORE an amazing relationship, but soon after. im as happy now as i think ill ever be. so i guess in my next relationship i will have my inner fulfillment and a perfect love. yeah. <<:-) (C0NEHEAD)
63BzEtMVaa	You can't control your feelings and who you are going to love! It's so nice that you have such feelings for that girl! Enjoy and don't feel weird because she's older or anything. What does age have to do with love?Love is one of the best things that happens in our lives! I usually feel miserable when I'm not in love...You should feel lucky there is a person  that makes you feel that way! And the girl is lucky to have someone who cares about her so much and loves her! <br>   <br>  I'd have no problem dating a guy 2 years younger than me if I had feelings for him and he had feelings for me as well! It's not like she's 10 or 15 years older than you or something. A difference of 2 years is nothing!<br>  <br>  Just enjoy these wonderful feelings you have and be happy! Don't bother for these minor things! If you love her, then go for it!:)|`|6vyWV0R6aa	i like older men not younger men but love doesnt see age|`|Cvlf7arlaa	i think cause you really like her or are reallly attracted to her.|`|R0sfHEX4aa	If she's a year older, yes. but any more than that, no.|`|UyYoxd3waa	Heeey Spider, everybody needs somebody and you are the age when hormones run wild So just let her know how you feel and don't worry about the age difference, If she shares your feelings every things gonna be okay!|`|4aF3c2qcaa	Don't trip bro.

I prefer older.<br>  <br>  If you can't see her for a year, I think its best to move on.

It's not like the age difference is obvious (I'm 19 and she's 22) and as long as it doesn't seem like she's the older one, then it should never be a problem. You just need to take a lot of lead to act like you're the mature one and it's barely obvious for them to notice you're younger.<br>  <br>  Just make them forget about the age difference and act like the older one nonetheless. It always works between me and my girl.<br>  <br>  ADDED (Reply to answerers):<br>  <br>  When girls hear of a younger guy, they would definitely feel put off by it. But if they meet some random guy and they fall in love with him, would that still apply when they found out a month later that he was 2 years younger than him? Of course not, she would still stay in love with him because he didn't seem to appear to be younger than her. <br>  <br>  You see the point? Though you are younger, if the girl falls in love with your looks and personality, she will no longer care about your age or if you're younger. <br>  <br>  But in a situation that she fell in love with you but then suddenly lost interest when she heard your age, that means that she is wishing to outlive the guy and keep the children (sounds absurd but I've met women who are like that searching for men 10 years older) and that is really the only case I can think of if a woman loses interest in you.|`|lo12E7T2aa	Yes i like a girl older than me and i like a guy younger than me. I think you should tell her how you feel. Honesty is the best thing in a friendship and relationship

jgXTrdS6aa	we are in an exactly the same situation!<br>  <br>  on the guy's perspective, given that we are thinking the same thing, well, you're not giving 'him' enough 'hints' that you guys are doing better or getting better.  he is sorta losing his hopes as of now, that made him text you less.  he thinks that he overdo the texting, it will turn you off and he will have even lesser chance to be with you.  and wait, do you go out whenever he texts you?<br>  <br>  if yes, then that's kind of weird... prolly he is confused and he can see that you're not that interested with him.<br>  <br>  if no, that's definitely why he is not texting you often.  he doesnt wanna sound so clingy.<br>  <br>  either way, if you really like him, you have to show him you do... and please, be the one to initiate something next time, sometimes we men get tired too of just waiting for your reply whenever we text you first and how our heart/life feel so useless whenever you dont even reply to a single text.|`|40c2dd53f8275fb6c6f6e563c70a669eaa	He probably had just finished a previous relationship or the last girl he was talking to ended, so he's going to someone he used to talk to. <br>  If your interested in him, it wouldn't hurt to go on a date with him.

KBkTDOZUaa	Unless you are really interested about the environment and the weather, don't talk about it. It's the obvious choice. Boring. And where can it lead? Awkward silences are difficult to get past so try doing some research and find common ground - something you're both into. Maybe he plays a sport? Whatever it is make sure that you know about it too, or if you don't at least be (honestly) interested and ready to learn - ask him to explain it to you maybe? Good luck. Most of all, just be yourself - if you're genuine and relaxed then he's more likely to be intereseted in you.|`|s7Y2WHSQaa	Ask him what music he likes, talk about the latest movies, ask him what his favourite foods are... just find some common ground and go with the flow!

GMMf4oEQaa	Well i think she may like you as a friend but nothing more or atleast it sure dont' sound like it. If she was really interested she would have called or msg'd you by now. Obviously she's not very interested ! My best advice go find someone who will be interested in spending time with you and getting to know you. It will be apple's problem in the end but you should not be sitting alone waiting for your gf to call , she should wanna spend time with you . Trust me find someone who's really interested in you and move on ..... no loss to you !|`|AA10653189	Help with what?  Sounds like a mythical person.

If you don't talk to her at least once a week then let her go|`|H1lZtSEdaa	ur gunna b blu ballin it for a while|`|vZz021Ssaa	really?? uhhmmm , just ask the girl again, pls try to see her, and just talk to her in person, u know much better if u talk the two of u in the silent place.. just be there of you two.. try to ask her anything for you,.. u can do it!!!!!|`|4lcubntyaa	set a date with her so u can talk and clear things out..|`|AA10313634	try having her meet you face to face and talk about it...her true feelings for you i mean..|`|RIfJ0HLmaa	Apple might be very busy in her life but its not true that she hasnt got time for u, if she hasnt seen u for ages that wouldnt be good news and u cant recognize that as a good relationship, a few weeks is fine but months is bad it looks like there is someone else on the plate maybe or shes not ready and also depends on how long u have been goin out and also how long shes been single for cause if she been single for a while it takes time for u to think about u <br>  at the moment it looks like  ....her feelings is not as strong as it use to be when those days u guys spent together . u need to somehow visit her and tell her how u really feel being separate and also about  not talking or havent been seein each other for a longtime cause and really need to sort it out or .....u need to somehow like u again|`|TpfRicqiaa	Well if she hasnt been calling you or messaging you thn she doesnt really show any interest. What you should do is ask her whats going on and why she doesnt message you. I dont know what she'll say, but if i were you, I'd ask first.|`|imX28Qd0aa	well if she doesnt message you or call you, how is she telling you that she still likes you. And always make sure what kind of like, does she like you as a friend as a partner, buddy or relationship bf. Dude move on she is probably just not interested. Find someone that will give you the attention you deserve.|`|zM6jlVJOaa	maybe she's shy to really do anything.  take it slow and talk to her a lot, that way she feels more comfortable with you.  Making people laugh is also a good way to help someone feel more secure with you.  good luck     ^_^<br>  if you want an answwer to the problem, you have to ask her yourself.  No one here has the answer.  Just tell her how you feel, it always works out for the best, but it might not work out the way you wanted it to. Whatever the outcome is you have to be honest in a realationship.  just ask her.
AA11363680	Well I'm guessing that both your sister and your girlfriend are drama queens. Anyone that gets physically ill over a petty argument is not emotionally mature.<br>  <br>  Listen, as harsh as it sounds, it's time to ask yourself if the relationship is worth it. Is the rest of the relationship healthy? Or is there all kinds of problems over every little thing? And do you see this improving any time soon?<br>  <br>  And while you're at it, quit enabling your sister's drama as much as possible.|`|689bdcac7ef55f01be173522554cba2caa	They should not be interacting with each other so much...<br>  <br>  <br>  Try your best to distract them and keep them apart.|`|OhGxSpm7aa	don't bring ur girlfren home then or dun even let her meet ur sis...u shld b more concern abt ur sister instead...she has blood relations with u n u can easily find another girlfren if ur current one leaves u...<br>  what do u tink will happen if ur girlfren marries u n bickers wif ur sis everyday?!?!<br>  IT WILL BE DISASTROUS!
AA11480344	The shoes look normal. I would think it would be kind of weird though..wearing lifts. You have to like a person for being himself/herself and for being self-confident.|`|X5Qzk78maa	why dont u just find a shorter girl, if ur 5'6 ur 5'6 not 5'9, just accept it, those things would just make u look dumb and shallow|`|9btcOpxXaa	natural|`|dSRTkObRaa	well i think it would be kind of weird if my boyfriend wore lifts because i would want my boyfriend to be comfortable with the height he is at<br>  it is not exactly a turn off, but i would suggest you not wear them<br>  I mean you are considerably tall at 5'6"<br>  i say the shoes look fine :)|`|XasLRQnXaa	that is the MOST retarded thing i have ever heard of.

sr7jX2wYaa	First  take a  large  bathrobe  with you  when you  take  a shower to prevent  further  episodes like the one you had yesterday.  When  he starts  pointing  out  his  brothers flaws in a mean way,  say " You know What  If you  were more like your  brother, you wouldn't have to put him down. It  really makes  YOU look bad you know. " When  he offers  to do  stuff or buy  you stuff  Always Say No Thank you, If I need  anything  ( Your  BF NAME) will do it  for me  or get it  for me.  Your gut instinct  about  him is probably  right, but just in case  it  isn't  do absolutely  nothing to lead  him on. Joking  or otherwise. & if  he doesn't stop  after you always stand up for your BF, & decline  his offers of help,  then  tell Him  you  would  rather  he didn't come over  unless his  brother is home. If  that  doesn't work, then  tell your Bf, You feel awkward  when he  there when your Bf is  not home & could  he ask him to not come by unless he is  home*|`|gG2CuoF8aa	just straight out tell your boyfriend.<br>  thats the best thing to do.<br>  if you wait, his brother might make a move, which wont be good.<br>  if your boyfriend gets mad over this, then hes dumb.|`|DybOqfGpaa	deffinalty he is mature enugh and trying to take u away from ur boy but plz dun do this stick to ur pather may b u can tell this to ur bf as well and u both can do something abt it ogether<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgP_MslGtuEtWxX20Xsm7Ynsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227120109AAhda2h">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|X8ImtFIDaa	talk to your boyfriend about it and if no one believes you, out a restraining order on him.|`|AA11108018	What do you want I assume you where nude or close to it. If you where nude did you expect him look out the window.  Do not encourage hin at all    Talk to your b/f in a clam voice and tell him I don't like when brother makes fun of you and trying to start a fight  with you Ease into how he makes you always wanting buy you stuff   Leave the bathroom part out.  Never let the brother in the house when just you are there alone unless his life is at stake he has the hots for you|`|E6C64Ui1aa	if you love your bf be smart tell him that his brother is a JERK!! just be honest tell him that you have been uncomfortable and you think that his brother should be around when your bf is and not any other time.. And tell his brother that you don't like him and to be quiet when he says something negative. tell him that he makes you feel uncomfortable. I mean be straight up about it, because with that kind of stuff you need to be. Its not fair to you to put up with that kind of behavior. <br>  <br>  that is what i think.|`|WaYC7W9Haa	Either you confront the brother and let him know he makes you uncomfortable or tell the boyfriend to handle it.  I bet he'll stop coming by then.|`|kEcFWz6Xaa	Tell your bf before the situation gets sticky.|`|WvIDTs4Paa	tell the brother to stay out of your life.tell your bf about him also.|`|Ry77jN0qaa	If you like both of them, make a decision and tell the other to back off, and dont include him in your together time.|`|d2FJBJ8baa	tell him to f off<br>  talk to your bf about it and just not let him come over|`|JWNzoksmaa	maybe you should explain to your bf how you feel and maybe tell him some of the stuff his brother is doing.  You know this is like dejavu for me here.  I ex-bf when i was that age had an older brother that liked me.  I will tell you this...b/c my bf had issues of his own, but it did drive a rift into between my bf and me b/c he believed his bro over me.|`|NcAAqe9Iaa	just tell your boyfriend about how his brother acts and it you don't like it. just tell him you don't if you're just being stupid or what but.. and then go on telling him about all the things his brother says and does. just be really quiet around his brother and give him no signals that you like his attention.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i think u should have a good talk with ur bf because if u let this go on its like telling his brother is ok  and u like it ..even tho u dont and u dont care for him but your bf.. even if they are brothers u have to be straight and honest and have that good communication with your bf in order for your relationship to be strong and solid and filled with respect.. talk to you bf brother and let him know u dont  approve of his behaviour towards u and u bf.. and that u want him to have some respect after all that is your home and he is a visitor even if he is the brother of your bf.. but i strongly suggest u do talk to your bf about it.. good luck|`|AA10674018	have you bf kick his ***|`|4sNC5io8aa	This is a very dangerous situation if not handled right.<br>  <br>  For one your BF brother has very little respect for you or his own brother.<br>  And to me that just says what kind of a slime ball he is.<br>  You need to let him know with out a shadow of a doubt that you are not and would not EVER be interested in him.<br>  That you love his brother and feel that if he also loved his own brother he would of never put you in this position.<br>  <br>  You need to let him know he is making you feel uncomfortable. And please expect him to be smug about the matter.<br>  He will probably tell you that you are dreaming and try to put it back on you.<br>  Before you tell him all this sit down with your BF and tell him what you are going to do and how you feel.<br>  Ask him if he would like to be there when you handle it.<br>  Be sure you keep this on a mature level with no arguing or fussing or this could get way out of hand.|`|txiYG1e6aa	Set things straight with his brother, tell him your not interrested in him. If he's still interrested in you just make it hard on him and show you love your boyfriend in front of him. Kisses hugs, junk like that. He'll back off or get supper mad, but either way he'll stop, and he'll get over you liking your bf and not him. <br>  <br>  Love always prevail, have hope.....

OhYE3GhKaa	I think this question will be difficult to answer intelligently due to lack of data. First you ask, "Is it wrong"<br>  <br>  You need to stop right there and ask yourself wrong according to whom? Is it wrong by my Kathleen's idea? Is it wrong according to the group Women in Support of Missionary Intercourse for Procreation? (I made that up)<br>  Is it wrong according to the Bible?<br>  <br>  Awake 1985 8/8 p. 24 Parenthood Redefined? ***<br>  <br>  Truly difficult moral and legal questions arise when, as Dr.?George?J. Annas reported, the increase in sex without procreation in our time has come full circle with the advent of reproduction without sex.<br>  <br>  Is the problem here that a woman wants to have children but does not want to have sex? Again, what is her situation? Is this a married woman? Is this a grown-up? <br>  <br>  the last problem, as I perceive it, it that you are really talking about 2 unrelated situations here. It might be easier just to say, is it wrong for a woman to have in vitro, like does the Bible say in vitro is wrong. <br>  <br>  then there is the discussion of the God-like woman and her situation of her options if she hates sex.*** w81 8/15 p. 13 “Do Not Be Depriving Each Other of It” ***<br>  <br>  “Do Not Be Depriving Each Other of It”<br>  <br>  OF WHAT? Of the sexual due, of a married person’s right to enjoy sexual intercourse with his or her lawful mate. The command is directed to the Christian husband and to the wife.—1 Cor. 7:5.<br>  <br>  Why did the apostle Paul, in writing to Christians, find it necessary to raise such an intimate matter? And why, indeed, should it be of such concern to Christians today?<br>  <br>  The Corinthian Christians to whom Paul wrote, about the year 55 C.E., lived in a city that was morally corrupt, so much so that the expression “to corinthianize” came into use as meaning “to practice whoredom.”<br>  <br>  As for us, we can agree that the world today is likewise morally corrupt. For many, sexual promiscuity is an accepted norm. Everyone is bombarded with sex through the medium of TV, the cinema, books and advertising. This produces tremendous pressure to go along with the world’s immoral standards.<br>  <br>  Christians live in this system of things and so they, too, are under this same pressure. The fact that some Christians, even after many years of walking in the way of the truth, succumb to immorality is evidence that this pressure is very real and dangerous. Though the pressure comes against both married and single Christians, let us here focus our attention particularly on those who have marriage mates, those to whom Paul directed the words of 1 Corinthians 7:5.<br>  <br>  A SAFEGUARD<br>  <br>  If you are married, how can you protect yourself—and your mate whom you love—from falling prey to sexual immorality? You might feel that your love for each other is so strong that this could never happen to either of you. But in the 10th chapter of the same letter to the Corinthians, Paul warned: “Let him that thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall.”—1 Cor. 10:8-12.<br>  <br>  In the seventh chapter of his letter, Paul offers this fine counsel of a practical kind: “Because of prevalence of fornication, let each man have his own wife and each woman her own husband. Let the husband render to his wife her due; but let the wife also do likewise to her husband. The wife does not exercise authority over her own body, but her husband does; likewise, also, the husband does not exercise authority over his own body, but his wife does. Do not be depriving each other of it, except by mutual consent for an appointed time.”—1 Cor. 7:2-5.<br>  <br>  Paul was aware, as most of us are, of what a powerful force sexual desire can be. That is why he realized that a course of singleness was not possible for all persons. Concerning unmarried persons he wrote: “If they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to be inflamed with passion.”—1 Cor. 7:9, 37.<br>  <br>  Even with married couples, a morally dangerous situation can arise if one of the partners arbitrarily deprives his or her mate of the marriage due for a time, especially if this extends into weeks or months. Because of “prevalence of fornication” and the sexual danger that could arise Paul counseled married couples not to be “depriving each other” of sexual intercourse<br>  <br>  anyway, it seems that the person who hates sex and opts to have in vitro in order to procreate is kind of trying to have their cake and eat it too. OK, so I believe in God and would say that the there is a reason it takes a man and a woman to make a baby. Even in vitro you need something from a man and something from a woman. A baby does best with a mom and dad. We all know of those who muddled through without one or the other, but children really need mom and dad. <br>  <br>  Maybe a woman who hates sex should not HAVE sex. Maybe she should decide to live alone and celibate. Maybe she should not have a baby. Maybe this would be a consequence and a natural one I would add of a life alone and celibate. Just a suggestion|`|XE1OKdOOaa	OMG,you totally have no idea what are you talking about...having sex is the BEST feeling in the world!|`|OwQsCR4Saa	In Vitro can't feel better than sex. <br>  <br>  I think you're crazy.
sr7jX2wYaa	I think  the  painting  is a fabulous Idea, it is  a memory & keep sake he will treasure. It will not cause  grief, it  may actually help him grieve, I am  so very sure , it would  more appreciated than the flowers. The painting is a loving & caring  gesture, please do that *|`|1ZfFSH6maa	flowers are nice, but when my family was going through a loss (it was my great uncle, honestly it didnt effect me that much, so i have a good look on the situation) they literally forgot to eat. no one had the motivation or the will to make dinner or lunch or anything. i suggest ordering them sandwiches from a local deli or something along the lines of that<br>  good luck|`|YbwDFvEaaa	I think the painting is a very kind gesture. Of course there will always be some pain at the memory of a lost friend, but those memories are important. It's the memory of our loved ones that keep them alive in our hearts well beyond their physical death.<br>  <br>  I'm sure her father would greatly appreciate the portrait, and it would be a wonderful tribute to the lost friend.|`|3CoHM0NJaa	The grief will be caused by the loss of their friend, not by a thoughtful gesture such as you have suggested.  <br>  <br>  Paint the picture and it will probably become a cherished possession of your girlfriends family.|`|WiaMtrnyaa	I think a picture of the uncle would be a great idea just to let em now your there for em and u care for em..|`|XTMNHuvDaa	make them a card saying ur sorry forf their loss|`|VrjHcSCuaa	i think a picture is a wonderful idea<br>  <br>  when my grandad passed someone done one for us and it is so nice. <br>  <br>  i think s its great if you do that|`|FgKecGFtaa	i would deff paint the picture BUT wait until like his b-day or christmas to give it to him but flowers are nice and Just be there but the painting will mean a lot|`|ergk5yLiaa	Just be there for them <br>  They need time to heal<br>  That is the best thing you can do|`|RTgMgT6baa	Make them dinner

Txyi4jQ0aa	I'm sorry, but first you need to find out if this other girl is a serious girlfriend or what. Heck just ask him or one of his friends or even the girl. But do not try to break them up. Then just talk to him sometime. If he listens and actually makes an effort to continue the conversation, or if he doesn't know what the h*** to say then he most likely likes you. If he likes the other girl he will most likely ignore you. Just be careful not to mistake "politeness" for a yes. If he's shy then its a whole different story however.
hrU14wMDaa	I am sorry that your husband is doing this to you. I think "your" family is going to have an unexpected emergency that you must tend to that week out-of-town. ;)<br>  <br>  I think that you need to put your foot down on this and tell your husband that you can't handle and can't afford this many people. It is not right for him to put this type of obligation on you alone. This is stressful!<br>  <br>  Are there any base housing regulations that state how many people may reside in a 3 bedroom home? If so, use that to your advantage to tell them that they can't come. "I am sorry (insert name) we were sadly informed that we can't have (X amount) of people in our home  per the United States Air Force Base Housing. We would really love to have you visit, but until we get a place off base, we are unfortunately bound by their rule and regulations."<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.

Pienso que no es bueno presionar ni que te presionen, en ocaciones uno se fija en la apariencia y se emboba en ello, pero lo importante es fijarse en el modo de pensar, el como la pareja reacciona ante un problema, conocer el carácter real de quien te pretende. y en ocaciones es mejor conocer quienes serán parte de tu nueva familia, no vaya a ser que tengas una suegra con la que choques, metiche y rencorosa por que te quitaste a su nene.   En ocaciones durante el noviazgo tratamos de agradar a la pareja y ?después?, ho sorpresa no era como se mostraba.  No te dejes presionar, si en verdad te "ama", no te presionará.  Una consejo amiga, si no estás muy segura de quererlo,mejor dejalo antes de que por la presión cedas a cualquier petición de el, sea la que sea.<br>  Muchas ocaciones también la calentura es parte para que las parejas se casen jovenes y luego quien sufre son los babys o tu misma al darte cuenta que te haz casado con el que menos hubieras querido. Y por último, no te ponga exigente, en muchos casos quien mas exige se queda con el peor y deja el físico en un segundo plano, claro tampoco te cases con un adefesio.

KWeU8LJtaa	Being there for a friend at times like this isn't inappropriate at all.<br>  <br>  As long as you keep it clear (like you seem to have done in the past) that you're being his friend ONLY, I don't see a problem.<br>  <br>  I mean you can be there for him when he needs to talk, but if it starts getting to the point where he wants you to spend the night at his house because he feels lonely, or wants to be calling you every night at 3AM to talk,etc..that would be a little much, considering you know how he probably still has feelings for you.<br>  <br>  So be there for him..talk to him, and let him know if he needs something to give you a call. As long as things don't get out of control and he starts mistaking your kindness for wanting something more than friendship, I think you're just being a good person :)|`|0jUGSaZPaa	I would do whatever makes you comfortable as well...  Definitely be there for him, but know your lines... <br>  <br>  He is vulnerable right now, so just be careful...<br>  <br>  I would just bring a friend with you, or even your fiancee to comfort him...  Your friend obviously needs a few friends around to make him realize he is important, and has true friends to support him...<br>  <br>  I'm afraid if you comfort him alone, his vulnerabilities will get the best of him...<br>  <br>  Good luck, sweetie...|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	If your fiancé doesn't have a prob with it, then what's the prob? You know what - friends have tiffs; they have disagreements, they sometimes do stupid things in front of each other. I've made a fool of myself once or twice while I was drinking with friends; but this is not who I am, and it would hurt if my friends based their feelings about me on these one or two silly incidents while drinking rather that on everything else they know about me.<br>  <br>  It could be that the issue here is deeper than simply drunken behavior. Seems that maybe you are uneasy about this particular person, you don't feel comfortable with him, you don't trust him. This mistrust can't possibly be based on just one incident - surely, there have been other hunches that pushed you towards mistrusting this person. You don't *have* to be a friend with someone when the friendship feels forced. It doesn't matter if you're engaged, married, single - this statement still stands. Your friends are people you are comfortable with.<br>  <br>  Don't blow one stupid incident out of proportion, but don't disregard your gut feeling either. It's really up to you whether or not you want to be friends with the guy, but if you decide you are friends after all, put the past behind you and help him now.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	comforting a friend who is in distress is not disrespectful to your fiance.<br>  <br>  Your behavior after the drunk incident has shown your friend that you won't tolerate that kind of behavior from him and that you will limit or end the friendship if he steps out of line.<br>  <br>  Put the drunk incident behind you and focus on the present.  If he misbehaves again then go back to limiting your friendship and only see him as part of a group.|`|AA11380378	Send a card and a potted plant and steer clear from Mr. Happy hands.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|HJ0YTWjVaa	You know in your heart how far is too far.

884v4VhGaa	If worn with leggings (Indian-style ones would compliment it more than the skin-tight kind, either way they should be colourful) then you can get away with it. <br>  <br>  However, as was said, you don't need to dress outside your culture. I'd say that you should pick a dress that you could wear to a Western wedding (ask your parents if you need help - below the knee, has sleeves, not clingy or shiny or low-cut). It's cool that you want to experience another culture, but some people (largely older people, but some younger adults too) might feel that you were mocking the culture and the style of dress.|`|aipChC3haa	I think you should wear something under it, but for the most part yeah it is OK.|`|R8VhFeEVaa	Some type of pant or legging underneath would make it just fine.

Sex should never be degrading.|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	If you are in counseling, you should mention this as well and deal with it now rather than put it off.  If there is no love, there is no reason for the sex other than give him a chance to humiliate you and it will get worse before it gets better.  He needs the counseling and you need to take a role of support in order for him to deal with past issues, or you need to move on with a divorce and find someone who can love you without the baggage.|`|rGStRem1aa	whoa!!

He has involved himself with a very specific type of kink, but I don't believe that what gets a person off is also necessarily what defines their views on the opposite sex.  There are plenty of dominant men, even those who enjoy humiliation, who treat women with dignity and respect outside of the bedroom.<br>  <br>  I do find it curious that this is new for your husband.  Since you don't particularly enjoy the D/s and he seems to require it, this appears to be a solid strike against reconciliation.  You should definitely bring it up in counseling.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Don't let him use his upbringing excuse for his kinky sex ideas.

I have an MA in Psychology, and even I think it's a mistake to try to read too much into fetishes.  A D&S fetish doesn't mean he hates women, it just means he has a D&S fetish.  Some people get really turned on by it and most people don't - that is the definition of a fetish.

pawJiFnHaa	Are you sure she does not know you don't like her anymore, are you still doing some things on your part to further her behavior. Try being honest with her first. Tell her how you feel and that you just want to be friends, if that doesn't work then just ignore her. She will stop if she doesn't have an audience in you to play to.|`|GrCj35muaa	tell her like it is. If she is too blind to see that you don't like her like that anymore then you have no other choice but to hurt her feelings as much as that sucks. Grab her by the shoulders, look her in the eye and say leave me alone. OR you could go the whole I like someone else route without actually telling her so. Talk about another girl with your friends in front of her or tell her about this great girl you have plans with after school.

If you don't like someone that way, you  just say no.  Don't be mean or impolite, but you certainly don't want to date him just because he likes you.  You may want to send some good signals to the other guy, and if the one you don't like asks you out just tell him thank you  but that you have been interested in another guy.

K6TeDfEZaa	Try to spend more time with your friend 'away' from Mom's BF.. Secrets can be dangerous, especially to those who value keeping them secret. Please let your friend know she can trust you to keep the secret, but try to convince her to talk to her Mom about it.. Usually Moms are very understanding about such things if they hear it from 'you' before they hear about from somebody else. And if I were her, I would wait before telling Mom that the BF knew. That issue would work itself out usually.<br>  Good Luck in a tough spot.|`|CVTVFJDwaa	i've had tht same expirence i bcame frndzz wid a bunch of ppl and turns out they smoked pot i knew them for like 4 months and we were gd frndz before i found out bcoz apparently they quit but started again at first i was rlly pissed and i was like ur gonna kill urselves but then i was like u kno wat tht sounds like a personal problem bcoz i tried to help u rejected my help so u can smoke jst dont do it around me and we dont have a problem.thts how it is u cnt change ppl, the only person u can control is urself unless ur frnd is willing to stop u cnt help her|`|k8fMMxKdaa	you broke a promise, you told the whole world!|`|tU5NJVL3aa	Her moms boyfriend?

901eafc186c995cb8a7e6e8ce846775faa	If they are the kind of friends that won't abandon you, there is no reason you should not try preserving your friendship.  Carve out your own little niche in this group by finding common ground with each individual, and then you may discover the common ground that brought you all together in the first place.  Suggest a group activity (something laid-back, like watching a movie at your house or going on a shopping trip) that you can take the reins in organizing.<br>  <br>  I think the worst thing you can do is be over-anxious about it.  Even if you try to hide it, it will be felt and the other girls will be uncomfortable, not with you, but with your insecurity.<br>  <br>  Take Care, good luck|`|RXmWudcsaa	Thats happened to me when I was younger. Im now 36. I know it hurts but dont let it bother you. Keep in contact with you friends 1 and 2. Ask them whats going on with friend 3 and how come they didnt invite you.

If you are happy, forget those others.|`|qfuhHeDjaa	i think it all depends on where you are in life. teenagers have a huge gap between those years... whereas a 27 yr old and a 30 yr old may not have such a big difference... your boyfriend could get in trouble for statutory depending on where you live and what the age of consent is... if your having sex that is... i married a guy older than me (more than 3 years) but in our life expierences and maturity levels we matched|`|YsNDkPd4aa	sorry i don't see your problem and good luck|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	im 19 and my boyfriend is almost 25, i dont think there is a problem because we can talk and feel like we're on the same level.

I think the main concern a lot of people have is that older guys usually go after younger girls to doop them into sex.  However, if you know this guy, and you have been with him for a while, etc.  3 years is not all the big of a gap.  If people give you a hard time about it, just remind them that this is your life, and not theirs, and to respect that.  If they still hassle you, then you can't please everybody.  If you don't really know him, or he does come on too fast with you, then take major caution, don't be anybody's puppet.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i see nothing wrong with  that.. as long as u both are comfortable and mature to handle a relationship.. people can say what they want but if he makes u happy and he respects u.. then u date him .. good luck to both|`|3pMQE32Vaa	there is no problem with that as long he loves u and u love him and he respects u there is no problem!|`|0K9b3WAIaa	3 years is nothing sweetie! If he makes you happy thats all that matters :)|`|WaYC7W9Haa	if you were 21 and 24 I would say "WHAT GAP?"<br>  <br>  It's the fact that you are still a minor and he's an adult so realistically if your mom wanted to she can report him to authorities.  This is something that is done all the time with girls dating college boys and their in highschool.  Now their future is doomed because of it.<br>  <br>  Parents look at it like this, what does this college boy want with my baby that's still in highschool!<br>  <br>  He's 19, probably in college and most girls 16 trying to keep a 19yrs are doing things what they think would keep him in the relations.  Trust me, it doesn't work.  Save yourself and your soul for this too shall pass.|`|GIPIjD2Oaa	The thing is when you're 16 people think 3 years is a huge age gap but if you were 40 then then 3 years would be completely acceptable. You're 16 now anyway so people should have less of a problem with it now. It's only cos they think that he could be after one thing, but you've been together a long time now, they should leave you alone.|`|9j2k2KeZaa	doesnt really matter atleast the love is there.|`|jnIGCkawaa	It shouldn't matter at all as long as the love is there.<br>  The age difference is a really retarded reason for others to tell you that you shouldn't be with the one you love.<br>  There's seven and a half years between me and my bf.<br>  And we love each other very much. Age difference isn't gonna keep us apart, not at all|`|0Fl2WbWKaa	Thats not that bad. I dated a 17 yr old when I was 19, and to make it worse I had graduated h.s. and she was just a junior. It's not weird, but it is a little difficult, that's a nasty age gap, especially being as young as you are. Once you get older though, 2 or 3 years isn't a noticeable difference at all.|`|AA10989335	Well, it happens. I'm not going to lie, I was there once too. Enjoy it for now, don't bother what other people think. As long as your family and his is okay with it. But if you can take a suggestion from someone who was there once.. Enjoy highschool. Don't take this too seriously. You are only young once and you should spend time with your friends and classmates as well. Once you get older and go off to college, you might find you outgrow the relationship, but for now, learn from it.|`|q1EDNQhBaa	That is an aweesome age gap! I am 18 and my bf is 21 and i love it.

Don't worry about a thing honey, you guys sound like a great couple.<br>  <br>  P.S. i literally just broke up with a 16 year old and i'm 19. nothing weird about it...|`|tjZZUb0Waa	Girl!!  Let me tell you something!  You're not the first woman to date a man older than her.  That's how it usually is, everyone knows you take a man's age and subtract at least 6 years and that's their true age.  3 years is nothing!  I'm 23 and I'm dating a 36 year old man now.  You come to find the older you get the less age plays a factor in things.  Depending on your level of maturity it's almost like you're on the same playing field.  Before this guy I was dating a 32 year old and I felt like I was oldest out of us two. Plus you're still in High School and things are way different you'll come to find when you graduate.  You shouldn't concern yourself with what people think of you.  They don't pay your bills or put food on your table!  You're happy with this person and that's all that matters.  The people that talked **** about me 5 or 6 years ago in high school are now a distant memory.  Most of them are knocked up or still living with their parents!  So keep doing you!  Good luck girl:)<br>  B|`|9lGnGBL0aa	don't give a damn. I'm 17 my gf is 21. who cares? I like her so why the hell would you give a damn on what other people think? Come on? why are you so insecure about it.<br>  <br>  LISTEN:<br>  <br>  Don't give a $#*7 or a damn or anything on what other people think about you. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your life.<br>  <br>  Do what you want.<br>  <br>  Ignore your ego, so what if they criticize you? What will happen? would you turn into a peanut? No. It's their fault for criticising, they only see the bad side. They are being pessimistic. be optimistic. They are just jealous that they see someone having fun and loving each other. Come on.<br>  <br>  Forget about the negative side. Just think on what is POSITIVE and ENJOY the most of it. <br>  <br>  Again, Don't give a damn on what they think about you.

I'm 20 and any time I see a guy my age dating a girl my little sister's age, I want to throw up. <br>  You see, you're still young. You have SO much to go trough and to learn about life. He already graduated. Think about his: why wouldn't he want a girl his age? Is is because he is too immature? Eventually this will catch up. You will mature and he won't. When you're over 21 I don't think the age difference matters because you are already an adult.  But when you are so young I think it does. He is a pedofile. He is over-age and as much as you don't think you are, you are still a kid. If you guys last longer, do you REALLY think he will wait to go to bars and nightclubs for 3 YEARS to wait for you?<br>  I don't know, I guess it's debatable. I just know guys and the way they are. And his reason for chosing a high school girl over a girl his age is VERY questionable. Unless you two do not have intimate relationships. If you don't then disreguard my whole rant. But if you do, then think about it.|`|GTdcnGT6aa	oh please, get yourself a life you are so young to be thinking about such things, age doesn't matter but you have not lived enough yet the time to think of age gaps is at least when your in your  late 20's. At your age you think it's love believe me i've been there,its probably not.|`|06Hro5okaa	Age doesnt make much differnce.  I'm 7 years older than my bf and things are great.

I'm 3 years older than my girlfriend. If I were to ask a question on Yahoo Answers about it then people would assume I'm using her for sex when actually were both still virgins. I've been with her for almost 2 years now and everything is great. I love her more than anything and I couldn't live life without her.<br>  <br>  And this is just the big problem here. Women or girls think they know so much about us guys. If they see us with a younger girl they assume were using them for sex. It's just the way society is today it's corrupt and stupid.<br>  <br>  Anyways I think it's perfectly fine. It's not like he's incredibly old or anything. It's love and that's all that matters. You've been together for a long time so obviously it's working out for you two.

I am sorry hun, but I don't think that he likes you. Well, if he has known that you like hinm for a while then, I can pretty much gaurantee that he doesn't like you. Guys don't tend to beat around the bush. If he liked you then he would have already told you. That't the way that things work. <br>  <br>  I really hope that I am wrong, though. I really hope that he likes you. But, I also don't want to give you false hope. <br>  <br>  Definitely discuss it with him. If you have never told him to his face how you feel, find a good time and just do it. If he has been flirting with you and stuff, tell him that what he is doing makes you think that maybe he might like you. If he tells you that he doesn't, tell him that you would appreciate it if he stopped flirting wiht you because no one likes to be llead on. So, I hope this helps :)<br>  <br>  And know, that even if this isn't the answer that you want, that there are so many guys out there.

You said you have a happy marriage now so if you want to keep it that way I suggest you forget you ever saw those e-mails and remember that was two years ago and there is nothing like that since. Didn't you ever care about someone else and haven't you ever wondered what if. Please girl for the sake of your own happiness let this go. He married you, not her. Please remember that. Every one has a few secrets so let it go and keep your own secrets secret. Good Luck|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Knowledge is power. It is wise to use it carefully. If it's not broken, don't fix it.|`|AA12346188	NO-NEVER-WHAT IS YOUR MEANING OF HONESTY? AND WHY?|`|8bTder08aa	You snooped his old eMails.  Oh, my.  Well, IMO that's a dumpable offense:  it shows a lack of respect for your partner and a lack of respect for yourself, and relationships where those things are lacking are not long for this world.  (If you respected yourself, you'd find the mere thought of violating someone else's trust, let alone someone you're supposed to love, repulsive to your sense of moral rightness.)<br>  <br>  It's pretty clear that no matter what your husband says, you're going to doubt him.  It doesn't seem to me that he has done anything to warrant this kind of distrust.  <br>  <br>  Realistically, even if he tells you he'll never speak with this other woman again, you're not going to accept his word, are you?  You'll be looking for signs that he's going behind your back, you'll be reading double meanings into things he says and does, and falling back into snooping again.<br>  <br>  The solution here isn't whether you should have a confrontation with him-- which would probably be the beginning of the end of your relationship with him-- or not.  IMO the solution is for you to hustle your bustle to a counselor or therapist to learn why you feel so jealous/insecure that you violate trust and breach personal privacy of someone you profess to care about.  If you work hard with the counselor to find out why you kicked your self-respect to the curb with the rest of the garbage and stooped so low, maybe you can salvage this relationship and your marriage.  But I wouldn't bet a nickel on it lasting, as things stand now.|`|ZYUeEbI0aa	Well id be really upset if my partner spied on my email.

The saying is "Don't rock the boat."  Keep your thoughts to yourself unless something solid should show up.  Most every person has a past and with some it's harder to let go than others.  The difficulty of breaking up and divorce is a pretty good barrier these days.  <br>  <br>  You should dispel your worries any way you can and remember that he married you.  Your very suspicions could build a barrier and once that barrier goes up it's virtually impossible to break it down.

X7i59NeIaa	I can't answer your question but I would suggest you call social services and ask them your questions. Tell them exactly what you have told us. I do know that California is very much into child protection. I lived there 33 years ago and the were very pro children then so I am sure they are probably even more so now. I wish you luck and until you know what you are doing do not let him have that child. It is much better to be to cautious than to be forever sorry.

ckDkNGL6aa	I would certainly see how many of the other mothers you can get to cooperate with you.  If they are having similar problems with him he obviously has a problem.  5 children by 5 different women is excessive.  If they are willing, all of you should contact an attorney about the issue at hand.  If you can prove even half of the things listed here, I do not see why you wouldn't have a case of some sort.  If you don't have his rights stripped, you should certainly be getting child support since he does little else for the child.  He needs to grow up and be held accountable for 5 little lives that he helped to create.  As for the other women, I am not familiar with what they have going on or if their situations are anything similar to yours, but hopefully at least one or two of them will be willing to help and there is strength in numbers.|`|X7i59NeIaa	What a mess.

HtiVTA0jaa	It depends.  My husband and I were engaged by 6 months, married at 2 yrs.  But I know people who have been dating for 7 years and still aren't sure that they want to get married to the person.<br>  <br>  My advice:  Have you talked to him about what you want?  If you have made it clear that you want a commitment from him and that it is something that you plan on, and he still refuses to acknowldedge it or to respond to it, I would -NOT- wait.  Talk to him.  If you don't feel like he is listening to you or you don't feel like he wants the same level of commitment, then leave.  You can find better.  Or when he changes his mind, he can find you again, but you don't need to waste that time "waiting around"|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	5 years this marriage and we have been together for almost 10 years.|`|xufESx85aa	My husband and I dated for three years before we got married. <br>  As for how long the two of you should wait, that is up to you guys.|`|9LXXs93haa	We have been dating for a couple of months,he proposed and on the 4 th month we got married on a civil registrar and got married again 7 months after that in the church with all the trimmings.|`|BOqdtldyaa	if your that worried about take the initiative ask him to marry you|`|RWr6Fhltaa	It seems like he wants to marry you, but his silence is coming from not being sure of you wanting to marry him.

X2bxkU2paa	Maybe there is some other retarded tradition Lebanesians resort to in this type of situation.  Maybe like challenging the suitor to a duel or something like that, lol.  Beat his @$$ and you win the girl!<br>  <br>  I doubt that though.  You're better off fighting with finances, as usually that's how these things work.  These people treat their woman like property, and fathers auction their daughters off like they're prized farm animals up for the bidding.  Its rather disgusting and barbaric, but it is what it is.<br>  <br>  Her father isn't going to give two sh*ts about how much you two love each other.  In fact, he probably forbade the relationship from the beginning, that is, if he ever even knew about you in the first place.  His daughter "depreciates" or loses value if she's been with another guy, so it would be in her father's best financial interests to not have you around "spoiling" his "stock".  Unless you can outbid the guy (or his family) engaged to her you're not going to get your girlfriend's father's blessing.<br>  <br>  This is the U.S., however, at least that's the section on Y!A where you posted the question.  Forced marriages are, indeed, not legal to enforce here.  However, her parent's blessing or rather, the lack thereof, can change many things for the two of you; especially if you two decide to go against their wishes.  Financial help, acceptance of grandchildren, and other help from them would most likely be out of the question.  This might influence your girlfriend's decision to any "disobey/run away” schemes you might be planning to ask her to take part in.<br>  <br>  You could in some way attempt to convince the guy she's engaged to that you already have had sexual intercourse with her.  If you have, doing it again shouldn't be too difficult for you.  Tape it, get a picture, something that proves it happened.  Then figure out a way to show the guy she's engaged to.  He won't want her after that; he'll tell her father why he's no longer interested; and her father will find out YOU are the reason he's no longer interested.  The daughter will be seen as valueless merchandise to any other man but yourself, and you just might be given the parent's blessing to marry their daughter.  Depending on the cultural traditions of the family and the mental stability of the father, the daughter might also be banished from the family or even murdered, so be careful and keep the potential consequences in mind if deciding to do this, lol.  There also exists the possiblity that your girlfriend will hate you for abusing her trust in you and invading her privacy by taping her having sex with you without her permission.<br>  <br>  In a matter of doing whatever it takes, you could always plan, organize, and just snipe the guy she's engaged to and hope (other than that you don't get caught) that her father picks you next.  But obviously, there is a list of morality issues and other problems that accompany such a desperate scheme that you, in all honesty, would be much, much better off simply finding a new girl to be "in love" with.  In fact, I shouldn't even have suggested it, but I suppose it is a plausible solution with the possibility of successful results in your situation should you execute the plan appropriately.  I still wouldn't do it though, lol.<br>  <br>  In fact, if I were you, I would just find a new girl friend; one from a family that doesn't practice such outdated and taboo cultural traditions.|`|uIUXpteMaa	it really hurts to know... about the one u love...<br>  try to get over it !!!<br>  as its not possible to get her back ... she is engaged !!!<br>  or if she also dis-agrees wid her being wid that guy so just take a rapid decision dont wait any more !!!<br>  go ahead bro...

Ih6Bgggsaa	sometimes guys act differently after a girl tells them that she likes him... it could be one of three things...<br>  <br>  1. he doesn't like you at all in that way: alot of guys personality change after they hear that a girl likes them because they don't like the girl. they feel that you started liking them  because they were being themselves so now they are going to act differently so that you stop liking them.<br>  <br>  2. he could also like you... guys get really weird around girl that they like and that also like them, they try to be attention seekers so that you will continue to like them.<br>  <br>  3. he is trying to get some from you... he doesn't like you but he may be taking advantage of the fact that you like him. he may be saying nice things, doing crazy stupid things in  plot to get you to sleep with him, it sounds similar to number two, that's why it is so effective and why so many girls fall for it.<br>  <br>  take some time to get to know him outside a different environment, go and have coffee, or go to the movies, and see how he reacts then, you may get a more obvious sign.|`|689bdcac7ef55f01be173522554cba2caa	Maybe he was smoking pot.<br>  <br>  Bwhahahaha.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	The guy is an *** and will make your life miserable if you go out with him.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I think he probably was trying to get your attention for some reason but it sounds like it was done to just annoy you.|`|RStOQvSWaa	its just is way of flirting. all guys have different ways of flirting and well....thats his lol|`|tpioRQHkaa	wow i need more singles and dating questions to answer. any way stretch his balloon|`|GwzwAC38aa	dude definatly has a crush on you. No doubt. hes trying every move in the book to try to get your attention. And if you want him this is your time to jump on this attention seeker so to speak :P he will eventually come to you if you continue to show interest as well.|`|7f5EVzShaa	maybe he likes you more then you thought and he's trying to flirt, even if its in a funy way.|`|JAGuqPxBaa	stay away from him|`|GqCkQlzJaa	Probably his way of flirting sounds like a funny guy. if your not funny stay away|`|sLDqymHzaa	Wow... well that's... interesting. He definitely likes you, and I think he's worried  he's losing your attention (definitely plausible if you haven't spoken to him lately or if you were upset with him). And I disagree with anyone who says "every trick in the book". Especially about this situation. I think he's just being himself (in a weird, paranoid, off beat kind of way, because he's worried about how you feel). And that phrase makes it sound like men practice getting women, and just whip out an over rehearsed, un-heartfelt "technique" when they don't get it quite right. Truth be told, there is no technique. It's all improvisation and self being. NONE of it is premeditated. Honestly, women plan on how to get men more than men do about women.
sQ4tvYUbaa	Why did you do this in the first place.  Basically, you're in the black market and it will be very difficult to get out.  I recommend getting out now and tested for STDs immediately because there is an extremely high STD rate in the porn industry.  Have a little bit of self respect next time.<br>  <br>  Also, if he didn't pay you then and there, then you just may have been scammed into preforming sex acts.<br>  <br>  Test shoot means it was probably a scam.  How do you know they are even legit?  What's the credibility?  Why do you want to do this?  Essentially, you're making yourself out as a prostitute.  Don't do that to yourself.  You're better than that, I guarantee it.|`|02sblnZGaa	guess you are a porn star...gooodluck sleeping with 1000 other guys|`|lXaPxiG8aa	seriously, porn is a HORRIBLE industry...none of the girls or men that do that are happy....alot of them end up commiting suicide or doing drugs..or they die from aids...<br>  <br>  honestly go to myspace.com/annielobert<br>  <br>  read her "about me" section...she was in the porn industry and HATED it...<br>  <br>  if you have a myspace send her a message..she will tell you the REAL truth about porn!|`|3F0H9Hjvaa	Really?

IhZeoXqvaa	I understand how you feel.  My boyfriend works with his ex girlfriend every single day.  Just those two alone at work (except for occasional customers).  He also has never given me reasons to worry, but I always get upset when I hear that they had talked.  But you really need to realize that if he is good to you and has never given you a reason to distrust him, then you should really try to forget about it as much as possible.  Talk to him and tell him that it bothers you.  Don't demand that he stops hanging out with her, but just say that it makes you feel a little weird.  Tell him that you want him to be able to talk to you rather than her.  I had to tell him that I was uncomfortable with it and he makes sure that he only talks to her about work or necessary things.  I think that you really just need to talk to him.  Tell him how you feel, not us.  Good luck.  My email is tie2870@yahoo.com if you ever need to talk to me about anything.|`|iiRbOAQnaa	I'm good friends with one of my exes and I really don't see him in that light anymore. She probably isn't interested in your man, or she would have prevented you two from getting together. Please don't try to make him choose, because he needs friends outside of the relationship, and considering she's his best friend, he might not choose you. It's not that he doesn't want to talk to you, it's just that there are things that they talk about that they've always talked about. That's the nature of friendship. I'm sure there's plenty of things you talk about with your friends that you'd rather not discuss with him.... Just let him have his space and his friends so he doesn't feel like you're trying to take over his life. The best thing you can do is try to befriend his ex/best friend.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I forgot to address the texting.... that's something you need to discuss with him. He needs to respect your time together by not texting back or letting her know that he's busy. Believe me, i know it can be hard and you can sometimes think you're going crazy, but you need to trust him and not see her as a rival.|`|tYO2Ir1oaa	I think there is a level of appropriateness, and even though they may be close and nothing going on, it is still- in my opinion- crossing the line to be texting each other all the time, especially in your presence. And yes, as his girlfriend he should be able to talk to u about everything he can talk to her about. I don't think it's a matter of making him choose as such, but rather letting your boyfriend know how you feel. Say that you understand that they are close friends, and u don't have a problem with him having friends that are girls, but that it bothers you that they spend so much time together and texting each other and that you don't think it's appropriate now that u are in an exclusive relationship. Say you are addressing the problem because it could quickly turn from something that is annoying to something which is actually rather hurtful. If he really loves u he will make some move to rectify the situation, and perhaps meet u half way. Personally i think the friend, as a woman, should respect your relationship and tone it down. I know i would.|`|c4Q0Lh0eaa	To be honest, I would guess that he is probably cheating.  But regardless, you should not have to make him choose.  He should have made the choice when he started dating you.  You should stop wasting your time and ditch him.|`|2yLjb2eBaa	Some of these signs are really, really bad. He may not be cheating on you physically, but by her being the ONLY person he can 'talk to about things' this is a really good indication that he is cheating emotionally with this girl. I'm not saying he needs to tell you EVERYTHING, that's creepy, but you should be his confidante, or at least his female one. You need to talk to him. Don't jump on him and accuse or anything, that'll make him defensive, do it in a very calm and rational way, if he really cares about your feelings, he'll listen. He may even be flattered that you're jealous. Don't insist on him choosing, just remind him that as his girlfriend, you'd like to be his priority over his ex. Maybe ask him to let the texts and calls go when you're together or something. Hope this helped!
Ikd9cppcaa	Yes it would be creepy. Don't add her. You need to run into her somewhere, smile and say Hi. Don't try to contact her on the internet or you will seem like a stalker.|`|5c2tW6d4aa	No, unless they were stalking me|`|PKwEKfG7aa	I always block anyone I don't know. If you like her then its probably not the best idea to contact her electronically, all she'll see from that is someone shes doesn't know who is to cowardly to talk to her in person. If I were you I would start talking to her first (real life talking) and then ask if you can add her.|`|EayT8T5Gaa	no it will not be weird cause she's probably seen you before!|`|fox5a3ePaa	No id think they were desperate for friends|`|Wrn6WH7xaa	Kind of, yeah. I'd think it was a little weird.|`|V9uCNn37aa	Well, their is nothing wrong with adding people on facebook as long as you approach them in a respectful friendly way. If you approach them saying  " your hot" you might not get an add, and you probally will get a block, so if you know this girl you can add her asking her wats her name or you want to get to know her a little better because you have seen her around Campus and she looks friendly to talk to. <br>  <br>  Make something up be creative :).|`|hnTfk3kpaa	Facebook is a way of getting to know new people. Nothing wrong in sending out invites. Some people have hundreds on their friends list. They can't know everyone of them personally.<br>  I sent a message to a stranger just the other day with a friend invite as we had a common interest. They accepted and we have been messaging each other|`|qv6C4kQraa	I add random people I dont know all the time :D|`|9ickjVI6aa	I ******* hate it when people add me randomly if I don't know you then **** off|`|YM3jlriXaa	aww hiya x<br>  <br>  like yall i mean who wouldent x<br>  <br>  <br>  x
tjZZUb0Waa	Gifts should be the least of your worries.  In my experience the people that spent the most on me were the first to screw me over.  I used to put value on those things "oh he bought me this or he took me on this expensive trip he must like me if that's the case".  Wrong!!  It's easy to find someone who'll buy you things but it's very hard to find someone who genuinely cares about you.  If you've found that in this girl then that's all that matters.  I'm pretty sure she's not rich and she's got bills to pay as I'm sure you do too.  If you're going to keep tabs on how much you spend then that depletes the value of your gifts.  Gifts are given out of appreciation and love and the way I look at it if you're going to keep tabs then I'd rather you not buy me anything at all.  Good luck!<br>  B<br>  Also Idk how old you are but the older you get the more expensive women become.  $220 on a b-day is only the icing on the cake!|`|yb7qKI2yaa	I was actually in a similar situation. My boyfriend had a very good job ,and had money to buy me amazing gifts. However, I was working at a job that paid a little more than minimum wage and I could barely afford my car payment. Instead of buying him gifts, I would make him dinner and made him a cake for his birthday. <br>  <br>  Maybe she can't afford to spend as much on you as you can on her. If things are going great, then I wouldn't worry about anything.|`|JwokyINXaa	The reasons why you maybe should talk to her<br>  1.She probably doesn't deserve you<br>  2.Maybe she is cheap<br>  3.Broke <br>  4.If she works she has a lot on her hands to even think about buying you a present<br>  5.What if she hasn't seen how giving you are<br>  6.Do you know if she is caring if she isn't that is another reason<br>  7.You probably are spending to much on her<br>  8.Doesn't care about you<br>  9.Think about how she be acting around you maybe she is cheating<br>  10.Get to know her learn her personality <br>  Like I said you too need to talk|`|XE1OKdOOaa	Well,perhaps she's a bit using you... <br>  Or she's just not as nice as you are... <br>  Take it easy a bit with those gifts... <br>  But don't make her think you're angry on her or something... <br>  Lucky her with that kind of bf...that's all I can say|`|ajQYu3TCaa	Its not how much you spend. If you want to get her gifts get her flowers or cards or write her a poem. she may not have the money to buy you expensive things. slow down and keep your spending down. if she likes you then it wont matter to her how much you spend. and treat her nice, ladies want to be treated nice and with respect. Thats what i do with my fiance, treat her like a queen. woman are gems, treat them special, open doors for them and be understanding.|`|ZgprgA1Naa	Okay I think you should be very worried! You are spending too much on her because she is not doing the same. No Christmas gift is major, seems like to me she is getting free meals and presents at your expense.  Maybe she is  a person that thinks the male should buy all the gifts but she has to show you appreciation and gratitude sometimes. Maybe she is just no that into you, just talk to her about it if its worth. In the meantime ease up on the gifts!|`|WDLnNm7Maa	Try not spending to much money on her, let her feel how it is to feel dumped.. but still buy her things because you don't wanna risk the relationship. Remember maybe she doesn't have that much money as you do, or she doesn't feel it is right to buy someone expensive things when she has only known you for 8 months, she prob needs time.|`|dYB98nYFaa	I don't think you should base a relationship on what she buys you or how much money she spends. You sound like a gold digging woman. But it is also a little silly to spend a ton of money on someone. She may be taking advantage of you. She also just might not be able to afford it. I buy my boyfriend expensive gifts sometimes but he cant afford to do the same. I dont make a big deal about it.|`|GTdcnGT6aa	you chose to spend the money on her, she didn't ask you to did she?<br>  maybe she hasn't got that sort of money to spend,did you think of that? if your worried just ask her.|`|26oL7vHoaa	shes just selfish or slightly inconsiderate. make sure she better give 50% to the relationship. and tell her youd like some gifts now and then.|`|4DdSB11qaa	maybe she broke...she gotta job? her peeps got money? if u answer no to both of those questions... what do u except. duh!|`|WaYC7W9Haa	Y.E.P!|`|9K6NfT30aa	forget about gifts brother just make her likeing you|`|9HWOqVIEaa	Dont buy her anything exspensive ur like spoiling her, Buy things around 20-30.|`|BosXJUoFaa	maybe, shes either using you or is just a cheap a**|`|W5oUJgcuaa	my husband is the same way. started to wonder why.. until he bought me a knife from a gun and knife show... yeah.. for Valentines day!! WTF??! <br>  <br>  *then I knew why..*|`|7hNHSkEGaa	You shouldn't worry too much. Have you tried having this conversation with her? Ask her what her opinion is concerning gift-giving. I know that everyone is different and shows his/her affections in different ways. My roommate, who's a girl, does not like giving presents at all. She thinks that time spent with friends and family means more to her than giving expensive material things. Also, try not to measure what your gf is giving against your standards of what a gift should be. I don't think that is fair.|`|t77xHdDwaa	Dont worry, <br>  She's probably didnt have time to get you a good present. Or maybe she will give you a huge gift for a very special occasion. <br>  And dont spend to much on her. Treat her as she treats you with gifts|`|VPXgwde0aa	well first gifts shouldnt matter<br>  second maybe she isint rich or doesnt have any money<br>  and third maybe she doesnt know you want gifts|`|EKVIX5Fxaa	First of all, stop buying her gifts...love has nothing to do with how much we spend on someone. But whether or not she has any money, there are still things that she can do to make you feel special. I am crazy broke right now, as I am sure most of us are in these hard times, but I always find a way to let my man know that I love him. She can surprise you with dinner, make you a card, leave you little notes, get dolled up for you, light some candles, etc....if she is not making any attempts to make you feel special, then I wouldn't waste my time.You sound like a good guy, and there are plenty of women out there that will....|`|AA11108018	You are just cheep you should out with your self.  This way you no one to blame when you don't get a gift|`|jtjISk6qaa	why are you concerned about getting gifts. maybe she doesnt have any money.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	First of all, rule out two things: that she can't afford to spend more, and that she's saving up for something great, like a holiday with you, or her college education.<br>  <br>  Then: I don't know if you should be concerned that she wants to dump you or anything, but long-term, I would certainly be asking myself whether I want to continue spending time with someone who didn't care about me as much as I cared about them.  If nothing else, it means your life expectations will be different.  If you're only worried about short-term, then...well, the only question is... can you stand not getting presents?|`|AA11367901	I think she is in a bind. Just keep sending her stuff.|`|2SrcH7bBaa	maybe she is just broke, or isn't used of ginving a lot of gifts|`|0CEOMRGbaa	Could be that she was just in a relationship where she did what your doing and didn't want it to happen again. talking to her about it might help|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	You can't measure love based on gifts. She might just be a bit stingy or not raised to give gifts. A cake is really enough of a gift for someone's bday.<br>  <br>  If everything else is ok in the relationship and you can deal with not getting gifts, than proceed. But if receiving gifts is important to you... Then she might not be the gal for you.|`|wzAhxdpKaa	I think you are right.  And even if it is a money issue on her side, she could probably at least spring for a card on every now and then.  I feel for you because there is no way to bring this up without looking like a jerk.  I hope you get some good answers here.... I feel for you buddy.|`|8i7AEWRCaa	mmm i wud buy u gifts back... i love geting and giving gift dont u like another gf? is she poor? u should know that... u can say if she dosent like to spend on u or she just dosent have money. to me it seems like she dosent like to spend and don no why|`|Wrn6WH7xaa	I totally agree with Banzai.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you really have a problem with it, start agreeing on prices for special occasions beforehand.|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	it shouldnt be about the money, maybe she doesnt have it. You are choosing to spend that money, if you dont want to then stop doing it. its not like she is making you spend.|`|Qe95LNxYaa	slow down there sparky you should stop buying her all this expensive stuff something cheaper would be nice to|`|5hlJwDBoaa	maybe shes broke but even so i write my bf poems<br>  and get them gifts but were all different i understand a card would at least be nice tell her how u feel u wanna feel special too =-]|`|IuP0ryOMaa	does she have the money to spend??
b8VRlStoaa	As a father in a similar situation, I ask you , how dare you even ask such a selfish question. Its ok for you but not for her ? I Truly understand your position and it stinks, but you need to do what you need to do for yourself and your kids , and so does she. The court was right in not allowing her to take the kids initially, but obviously the circumstances have changed. Its not like your going to commute to work every day, so the real problem here is convenience and expense. Your going to move away, but not as far as she wants to move, and it would be more convenient to only have to travel from virginia to florida then all the way to california. Sorry man , that's not how it works.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	If she allows you to move, the right thing to do would be to offer her the same courtesy.<br>  <br>  What makes you think you can move without her permission?  If she won't grant it, you will have to appeal to the courts to move to NC.<br>  <br>  What goes around comes around.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if you move out of state then your ex can petition the court to have the terms of the custody order changed because the whole reason to keep her in state is so that you can be near your kids BUT if you leave then there is no longer any reason for her to remain in state as well.<br>  <br>  You're right, you are in a lose-lose situation.  Which is worse?  You go to jail where you can't see your kids nor earn a living and support your kids or you move out of state so you can support your kids but then only see them a few times a year?<br>  <br>  How about a compromise?  The ex wants to go to CA, can you find a job near where she wants to live (try AZ or Nevada or Oregon as well as CA)?<br>  <br>  Talk to your lawyer or the judge and see what kind of compromise they can come up with.  Maybe they can limit her move to something within a distance of where you are.|`|040115101fd4e24b2fd4488f18b7a9c9aa	These are questions a judge will have to decide but you should be able to get permission to relocate, and if you were not working for a period of time you may be able to get the 1000 adjusted.  You need to get an attorney - legal aid if you presently can not afford one - and let a judge sort all this out.  Whether the judge allows you to move will have no bearing on whether he can move as well unless he also has a good job offer in California.|`|CQTV4ntqaa	All you need to do is talk to a judge and explain the situation. For the reasons you are stating, I don't for see a problem. Good luck!|`|GaLw1qMwaa	you need to have a talk with the judge ASAP.<br>  <br>  if you explain you cant provide income unless you move then i would think they have to allow you to move.|`|dnFjdJ72aa	maybe
Likst1Mxaa	suck it up princess.<br>  <br>  or get new friends.<br>  <br>  girls are b!tches, one day you can be mates with them, the next you'll do something dumb and they hate you. Get used to it. It's called life.
pA55qVjraa	Maybe you could express to your friends what you are going through and suggest that you all hang out at home or simply change the type of activity that you do into something less tiresome. I hope you feel better soon.xxoo
wqchA8B7aa	Standard - man on top, woman on bottom. Save the kinky stuff for later.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	bottom unless he is to big and you are to small then on top gives you better control to not get hurt|`|SAgCy83Oaa	A wedding.<br>  <br>  Seriously: Female-superior is not kinky.  In fact, since it allows you to "control" the penetration level and timing, it could very well be the difference between you enjoying it or not.|`|uc0CYzpLaa	haha this is a given sweetie<br>  you should be on bottom only because you're not experienced and you don't want to create a awkward moment to ruin the mood.<br>  soooo i'd say have the guy on top.<br>  it's alot easier|`|1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	I was on bottom.....but that didn't work out very well for me.  It probably would've worked out much better  if I had chosen a much, much, smaller partner though!!!   Baby steps.  Baby steps.  There really is something to be said for that!!!  Jeez.|`|983a3a8efe5cb244e13ce535ec318f27aa	Ideally a bit of both, plus various other positions.|`|AA10156473	Something that makes sex in general so great is spontaneity - leaving room for the unexpected, and moving with the feelings that you cause/receive with whomever you're with.<br>  <br>  When you plan things...that's when you begin to set expectations.  When those expectations aren't meant, that's when you become disappointed...and while naked with your lover is one of the worst places to start getting aggravated.<br>  <br>  If you feel that your first time is fast approaching, let it happen as it does.  It's obvious that you're going to try to foresee every little detail of how it will all work out, but don't try to control the situation, ya know?<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  Logically, HOWEVER...if this is going to be your first time...you might want to be on the bottom.  Though all women are different, it is very common for a girl's first sexual experience to be a little painful.  Don't let it keep you from this, though, if it's what you really want.  The pain goes away quickly, and before you know it, you're in total bliss...depending on how well your lover knows what he is doing.<br>  <br>  Tell him to be gentle and considerate; don't let him rush you into anything you're not physically ready for.|`|lnWvaRWBaa	For your first time, go for on bottom and be sure to ask him to be gentle if you think you need to. After the first few times then you can work your way into being on top, and then other positions. Get used to it first.|`|phXY5z7Eaa	Girl my first time was from the back and it hurt like hell, so if i was you i'd be on bottom for awhile then yall can try different moves lol|`|q1EDNQhBaa	him on top, wont hurt as much and he can really hold you in a loving way and you can just look up into his eyes and be all dreamy lol|`|9K6NfT30aa	using condom|`|qN7xNavCaa	first time guy on top. it will make it easier for the both of you|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	for first time. man on top|`|4Zdp7fu9aa	U on the bottom and ur man on top..|`|tjZZUb0Waa	First of all protection is the most important.  No matter how much you get caught in the heat of the moment you better make him cover that pickle! lol!  But on a serious note, I always say play it by ear.  Sex is one of those things you can't plan, well that's if you want it to be good sex.  You've just got to let everything kind of happen even the sex itself.  Once you get into the kissing and foreplay you'll feel more comfortable and maybe even confidant ;) and things will unfold from there.  Everyone has their own preference of top or bottom and you'll figure that out.  Maybe start off on the bottom, see how comfortable you feel and then if you want to be adventurous make that climb to the top.  But speaking from experience, it's going to HURT so getting on top might be the least of your worries.  Good luck girl!<br>  B|`|tCFoCNxbaa	Female on bottom, male on top.

5SCD87hTaa	you need to tell their parents. though they will not like to talk to adults they need to. tell their parents and you may save thier lives.|`|Likst1Mxaa	I did a course a few months ago where we talked a lot about cutting/self harming.<br>  <br>  Lots of people don't realise this, but cutting is what called a maldaptive coping strategy. That means that people have found a way to deal with their problems, but it is not a very good solution.<br>  <br>  It is really important not to make the person feel guilty. don't say to them to stop cutting, as this can cause guilt and cause greater depression.<br>  <br>  It is really important to remember that cutting is NOT the problem. The problems that are going on in their lives are the reason they are doing it. (That also applied to people who you might think "do it for attention." If they are going to that extreme to get attention then they need it!) <br>  <br>  Encourage your friends to see a school counsellor or to talk to some that they trust. They could all go at once even. I know that some kids don't trust adults because of what is happening to them. that's understandable. However, you are a kid and YOU need someone to talk to. <br>  <br>  I would try the cutters' hotline again by yourself an dtalk to a different operator who might be more helpful for you.|`|364815ba0e4e52ba14aa1cef4ad4e5a0aa	You should tell their parents and confront them.<br>  <br>  also, Boozy gets the humanitarian of the year award.|`|26oL7vHoaa	its a really simple and hard decision. they simply need to stop.<br>  they need to physically put the knife down, when they get the urge, and walk away from it. and they do need to see a therapist, and get over the fear of adults. i saw a therapist with severe social anxiety, and i was so afraid, i started panicking and crying....then i wasnt so nervous around the tehrapist.|`|4c6jJrXbaa	i used to be a cutter but i havent cut<br>  in about 2 years now, i dont even have<br>  the urge to do it. but i was like 15 and i<br>  went to therapy. it helps alot, you can <br>  learn ways of stopping :]<br>  <br>  there are also groups where you can be with<br>  other young teens who have the same issue.<br>  i think its called teen group therapy. its alot<br>  of hel[p and your in a good environment and you dont<br>  have to deal with adults judging you and you wont be<br>  doing it alone. <br>  <br>  if i could get through it, your friends can too :]<br>  you can add me to myspace if you like :]<br>  <br>  myspace.com/gerardismyhomeboy|`|ZWsCHjIKaa	cutters useally dont let other people know they r cutting... if all of you know about it then it must be a attention thing.... and its a not a good form of attention... they probly dont have any intention of killing themselves. but if you want it to stop... send a letter to a school counsler or trusted teacher with the girls names and what they r up to....you dont have to give your name...and they wont have to know it was u who told... but a responsible adult will take the necessary action.  i speak from experience.

f7e9b138df29ae33c98ee1f2a737d794aa	story from the little box:-<br>  <br>  It's meaningful....<br>  <br>  Once upon a time, there was a teacher and his student<br>  lying down under a big tree near a big grass area.<br>  Then, suddenly, the student asked the teacher,<br>  <br>  Student : Teacher, I'm confused, how can we find our soul-mate?<br>  Could you please help me?<br>  <br>  Teacher : (Silent for few second, than he answered)<br>  <br>  Well, it's a pretty hard and easy question.<br>  <br>  Student : (Thinking hard) Huh???<br>  <br>  Teacher : Look on that way, there are a lot of grass<br>  there, why don't you walk there but please never walk<br>  backward, just walk straight ahead. On your way, try<br>  to find a beautiful grass and pick it up then give it to me. But just one.<br>  <br>  Student : Well, ok then... wait for me... (walked straight ahead to the grass field).<br>  <br>  A few minutes later...<br>  <br>  Student : I'm back.<br>  <br>  Teacher : Em, well I don't see any beautiful grass on your hand<br>  <br>  Student : On my journey, I found few beautiful grass,<br>  but I thought that I would find a better one, so I didn't pick it up.<br>  But I didn't realize that I'm at the end of the field, and I hadn't<br>  picked up any. Because you told me not to go back, so I didn't go<br>  back.<br>  <br>  Teacher : That's what happened in real life.<br>  <br>  What is the message of this story?<br>  <br>  * Grass - is people around you<br>  * Beautiful Grass - is people that attract you<br>  * Grass Field - is time<br>  * In looking for your soulmate, please don't always<br>  compare and hope that there will be a better one. By<br>  doing that, you'll waste your lifetime, cause remember..<br>  <br>  "Time Never Goes Back".<br>  <br>  It applies the same in finding your ideal life<br>  partner, your suitable career or business, therefore<br>  the morale is LOVE & grab hold of the opportunity<br>  that you have now, don't waste time!|`|c4cfba6513ac3ad33bb7682fdbfb851daa	well tell her how you feel, and see if she feels the same for you.

25da81abac9f6d6ccac95af4c3e918cbaa	congrads, my advice is, as a newlywed, is that it doesnt matter how much, size carat, and anything else its how you bring up the proposal, like i was asked at work, ...and i will never forget it... you need to do something unquie because you will remember that for the rest of your life.... like take her out for a candle light picnic and ask her under the stars...your love should mean more than spending a arm and leg on a big fat diamond....  good luck:) and have fun!|`|AA12390643	dosen't matter if its love she won't care|`|e1ff506f48f2d298ec55cc446fc2d164aa	Don't.|`|0ced62b93f8655aee10c98084b5d310aaa	well it depends on the chick she may like big and gotty so she may like small and sweet it is not the size or shape that counts it is the thought|`|d99832e130a64a06093d4aaedf7fe11eaa	Dear Pepe,<br>  <br>  First of all, congratulations on your pending engagement, You should educate yourself on the quality of diamonds. A reputable jeweler is a good start. The ideal size is a perfect carat in a princess setting. It just stands up and reflects the most beautiful colors in the light. But can you afford that? Let's see. Usually one pays 20% of his annual earnings on a wedding ring. It's an investment for a lifetime. I'm sure you'll pick wisely. If you can't afford a good quality one carat right now, buy the most you can afford and down the road when your finances have improved. you can always surprise her on Mother's Day or her birthday or better yet, your anniversary with that ring you always wanted to give her,<br>  <br>  I hope that helps!<br>  <br>  Ciao!<br>  Raylene|`|f4d086e02466e5d4e681bb1115e14661aa	I'm shure she's going to love any ring that you give her i mean  my brother wanted me to come with him and buy a ring for his girlfriend but i don't care because she's going to love any ring for her and she loved it when my brother give it to her.|`|AA12400186	Obviously any girl would love to have a big rock on her finger but that is not the most important thing.  How you give it to her and how you make her feel when you give it to her is the most important thing even if its a small ring that doesnt cost much.  Showing that you love her and want to spend the rest of your life with her is what she will be most happy about.  money and size of ring is just a plus after that.  Definitly only buy what you can afford.
SbTaLr2Waa	There's no way to get in that kind of relationship without risking ruining the relationship. If you guys have been friends for that long I'd think everything would work out well since you guys probably know eachother quite well.
AA11951420	um well you two should go to counseling if both of you want to make it work...three kids?

Both of you are just as guilty here.<br>  <br>  Two wrongs don't make it right.<br>  <br>  If you two really want to get your marriage on track, you BOTH have to knock off this silly stuff and get to work on your relationship.|`|32196c2122951435ba906612dc97e08baa	No, dont serve her with divorce papers just yet. I would suggest going to marriage consueling first. But if the situation doesn't improve, then maybe you should consider divorce. But even before you decide to go through with the divorce, think about the pros and cons of having a divorce and how it would affect  your children. Talk to to your children (depending on their ages) and ask them how they would feel if you and your wife were to go through with the divorce.|`|a95798c65a9593f00697d56d72facac1aa	Both of you need some serious help.  I'm surprised your marriage lasted this long.<br>  <br>  Your marriage should have been based on love and respect, not lies and deceit.  The fact that you had, not "one" but "two" children with "two" different women, (while you were with your wife), makes it obvious that you were neither emotionally mature nor committed to your marriage.<br>  <br>  Obviously your wife has her own "issues".  Her "explanation" about the "wall" is a bunch of crap, it's nothing more than an "excuse" for her behavior.  She knew when she married you what your "track record" was.  If she wasn't able to "accept" it, she shouldn't have married you!<br>  <br>  Neither one of you were emotionally ready for marriage.  Now, sadly, there are children involved.  Where you go from here is your decision.  I think you need to get some "outside" help to make any decisions.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you choose to stay "married", you and your children need some "counseling".  Do not "drag" them into any "adult problems" you and your wife are having.  They need "stability" now and they need to know that both of their parents love them.<br>  <br>  I wish you well, personally I don't think either you have much of a chance unless you get some professional help.  Good luck.|`|e454bdb66416d7041c98277d234eaee5aa	I am getting devorced right now, and what happened to you is similar to what happended to me, I cheated on my wife before we got married a number of  times, and she ended up finding out, well then she pretty much ended up doing that to me, What I have concluded is that it was pretty much all my fault because I did it first, and I think that can put unseen walls in a relationship, I think maybe you should try being without her and working on yourself and mabye seeking counsouling then trying to get back together, at the very least I think you should bring a third party into it. good luck
fad30a0cc19b9273a11eab0f636fc292aa	Just give them a big smile...then maybe ask the time...it all would depend on WHERE you see this person..but ask a generalized question...or make a comment about whatever you feel is an attraction for you.

First, if you two were meant to be together, he wouldn't have another girlfriend. Secondly, if you can manage to lure hiim away from this girlfriend, then you know that he can't be trusted to be faithful, and there would be no reason why he couldn't be lured away from you.  Be a friend, but be respectful of his lady as well. Encourage him in it. If that relationship doesn't work out, you will only look better in his eyes for being supportive and accepting. And in the meantime, focus your attention on available men, or on yourself and your own self esteem. If you are happy with yourself, you will "broadcast" that through your actions and your attitude, and who knows who that might attract!|`|db8ebb92b82f0d44396c11d69f439af4aa	trick her gf that he wants to meet him somewhere hes not and do the same thing with the guy and meet with the guy

dVpyca3Eaa	Thats really hard for some people to discuss and every situation is different. I have been divorsed since 1999 my kids were 2 and 7, they are now 10 and 15. I have spent $22,000 to keep my kids. But every year my husband takes me back to court to try and get custody. So i guess it depends it could last forever it seems like it will never end. In my case probably not till my kids are 18. All because he doesnt want to pay child support.|`|THWHHHRWaa	3 years...n.c.|`|d57e29c219b565c305798b1e32e4886faa	Mine lasted about 5 minutes.  My ex said "You're her mother she wants to live with you."  I said "Fine."  My ex has had very liberal visitation with our daughter, when we lived in New York he could visit her whenever he wanted, we dispensed with the "traditional" every other weekend.  As long as he called to let me know he wanted to see her it was fine.  When her and I moved to New York he would get her during school vacations and she lived with him for her first college semester.  With his job he also travles to California often so he can see her if she wants to see him, now that she is 21 I leave all those arrangements between her and her father.
ZKyDOKqOaa	Find out what her interests are. Go on the computer and look up as much info about her interests as possible. Once you both get to know each other better you will have more to talk about. I'm a nurse and we were taught about communication and one of the things that they teach us is that silence can be theraputic. So I'd don't think that silence is a bad thing.|`|AA11151794	Someone is going to have to "break the ice".

If you do, then that's going to be a big problem then this question you asked. If you don't like this boy and he asks you out simply say no. And do you also know that this boy don't like your friend? You should talk to your friend and see how she feels if she found out that he likes somebody other than her and is tryin to get with her. And if she says that she doesn't like that, then i think you shouldn't go out with him. And if you do like him, ask yourself what is more valuable, your friendship or this boy?|`|R3u1PFDMaa	who do u like? more ?|`|bc2db2282b517b57c1656f8fe837d22faa	well i have been thro that many many times.. just  try to get alway from that guy and dont act flirty around him...just wait and see what happens.. cause u can do many things but u cant change the future.. just wait nd see

If you want to be used - that's your choice.  Just remember that you have to live with the consequences; and also what comes around goes around.  Hopefully if you are ever engaged you fiancee will not play you as well as another one of his co-workers.<br>  <br>  Sucker born every minute....|`|AA11265002	I would reckon it's a last minute fling. Imagine yourself marrying to a two timing liar like him where he has the potential to be both engaged and tell another co-worker he "loves" her? hmmm.... suspiciously insecure|`|AA11649785	Why are you wasting your time with an idiot like that? Duh!!!|`|f24ad8b6c9908f3c47d4b1c53bd16788aa	I don't know about him... he doesn't seem like he can commit to you or that other woman since he's seeing the both of you at the same time. A man like that doesn't seem ready for commitment at all- even if it is a last minute fling, there is no excuse. If he is trying to find a way out, then he's pretty much a coward! If you continue your relationship even further (like, another hour, another day) without saying anything, then he'd go on thinking about you condone it and that everything is perfectly alright, even with this "fiancee" on the side. Either keep your dignity and respect yourself by LEAVING him (as long as he is with her) OR give him an ultimatum. Anyhow, keep in mind that you should keep yourself in mind and respect yourself, because this man doesn't seem like he is.|`|7a12e47848285d88aba6bae31dec0bf8aa	He's not taking you out, you're letting him take you out.  He's not doing anything you're not allowing him to do.  If you had any self-respect, you'd not even get involved with this guy since he's already spoken for.

I just don't like being naked for a long time. Especially if the room is cold. Lol. Anyway, how long have you 2 been together. Do you know him well or you just think you know him well? I don't know. He could just want to get dressed. I wouldn't stress it too much.|`|AA10591117	Jesus H Christ, I hope you're not serious!!!|`|b90e42d25bd45025e46d388ab0c06d12aa	just interested in sex|`|AA11190672	Maybe you guys had sex too soon and now the relationship is based on sex.  The fact that he puts his clothes on shouldn't be the upsetting thing, but instead like many others have suggested, if you want him to stay the night with you then ask.  He should be able to accommodate you on that at least every once in a while.  Since he does leave every time and never offers to stay over would raise a flag.|`|LSC4LVqzaa	Uhm, doesn't sound good girl. After I had sex with my new bf for the first time (on a Friday) he didn't leave until Sunday night to go to work! Then came back after work and...well you get the point. I think that is kinda how it should be in the beginning. Should not be able to tear yourself away, ya know? If he's always leaving then definately there is a problem. Sometimes we like to make excuses for people when they do something that bothers or hurts us but I would say find a guy you don't need to make excuses for. May sound a little harsh but believe me, there is nothing worse than staying with someone who isn't your dream partner. Ask him ONCE and if he doesn't have an extremely good reason like he's rushing off to care for his dying mother, move on!|`|WlGkw06oaa	Unfortunately you are probably correct in what you are feeling|`|aXAXrI7taa	Erm, it sounds like he might be!  Do you ask him to stay over?  Usually in a new relationship you can't get enough of the new person and want to be with them loads!<br>  <br>  Have you asked him why he leaves?  He might have a valid reason for leaving so quickly?  Also, have you asked him to stay?  If he refuses, ask his reasons!<br>  <br>  Deep down in you gut you'll soon work out if he's interested or not.  Go with you instincts!|`|pZTT5Pr3aa	yes it sounds like he is not cool with it if he just leaves..he can't handle it..why not do something after or before..

Even if not going as a wedding, the consultant or travel agency can find best deals for the hotel you want, flight (airline) and period of leaving/arriving window depending on low or peak seasons etc.<br>  <br>  Packages at those rates, are not set in stone pretty much as their is hidden charges (They hyatt charges $20 I think per night for activities fee, whether or not you use them or do) and non-related financies like renting a car etc.  So, taking a gamble doing it yourself. <br>  <br>  Can looking to pleasant holidays travel agency *used in december and it was great.<br>  <br>  or can use a wedding coordinator, and I can give you info on mine who is in Lahiana- Maui, Hawaii, if you are going in that location.

I consider it cheating when someone is even just wanting to be with someone else, it's not just physical, it can be emotional too.  He probably is just fooling around but I'd be irate as well, especially because he had already been with her.  Atleast  he does admit that he is involved with you.  However, I'd stay extra alert.|`|TVAdQwjyaa	Sounds like he needs attention.  I equate internet chatting to talking on the phone.  It's pandora's box and can lead to more than just chatting.  Next thing will be unexplained absences and like you said, better hiding.  I went through this with my boyfriend.  He didn't stop the chatting until he accidentally chatted with one of my girlfriends and got himself busted.  Although, he could have stopped for other reasons as well, such as the wrath I unleashed on him, where he had to make a choice between me and the dam board.<br>  <br>  Ask him how he would like it if you were chatting with countless men and flirting?  He'll change his tune real quick.  Trust me.

WJQtp8nnaa	I'm not sure how old you are, but nothing breaks me out of my shell like a shot of vodka, just one. It won't make you drunk but it will give you confidence to talk to people.  I am a very shy person and I tend to be quiet around guys I like but every since I learned about vodka, I've been alright. The key is to not drink too much. One shot will do it but if you continue, you may embarass yourself.
Qovy47HNaa	hehehe, kinda romantic way of writing you have:) you must be a real sweet girl^^... <br>  <br>  well i'm a guy myself, and this situation kinda reminds me on what I used to do. It often happens, that I behave curiously to girls  I actually like.Shyness can be a reason why he is like that. The more you try to attach to him, without actually beeing near to him, the more he will try to evade, though he likes you.<br>  Also, he may be a modest soul, so that when you complement him, he's not feeling comfortable and answers without enthuziasm. Some boys are girls-shy...  You need to have patience with em.  Make him know you like him, but not neccessarily by words. Look straight into his eyes, and you'll figure it out if he desires you. Try walking to him every morning, or afternoon, on your schoolway. There you will ave plenty of opportunity to talk to him, to say to him the right things. It's hard for outsiders to say to you what to say, since we don't know exactly how you are related with him, what you have experienced together. Good luck to you, anyway!<br>  Shy boys, like me, never show initiative. :) So show some yourself, if you want to come out of the impass.|`|HJbH2DtAaa	umm guys like girls that can start a conversation with them.  It doesnt really matter what you talk about as long as you can keep a conversation going.  It's okay that your friend likes him too becuaes that would only prove that he's sometihng special.  You shouldnt compliment a guy often, because that would only increase his confidence or he'll think you're sucking up.  If you're afraid to lose him then wait for more signs.  Maybe he only sees you as a friend right now, BUT give it time to let him get to know you.  Who knows?  He might like you in the end.
0u9gguq7aa	i dont think he likes you anymore|`|lqi9dXuVaa	im sure he probably wants to talk to you, but is wondering why YOU arent talking to HIM. sometimes you just have to step up and make the first move. plus, its a pretty simple move to make. same sitch here btw [[bout liking my best guy friend]] and once i started talking, we started hanging out at school a lot more. i found out that he was just as willing to talk to me as i was to him. good luck!|`|0c1TxQp8aa	ask him like why are u so weird aroiund me now a days??|`|5CTtWmFFaa	mm start a convo with him. he probably is thinking the exact thing. If  he tells you to go die... then he found out and doesnt like you... =D|`|AA11143258	If he considers you a 'best girl friend" he probably won't want to ruin the friendship that you have by going any further.|`|kRmVHRUdaa	You never know until you try the longer you guys go without talking the more awkward it will be to start up a converstaion. <br>  So just say something and make converstaion smile to him in the hall or wave or something cause then you seem like cold shouldered. i know it can be awkward but just break the barrier and things will go fine he wont find it weird if you say something he probably is wondering the same thing  about you.<br>   Hope you get your man :)<br>  Good Luck
RagQhT22aa	T... you should be careful with this guy.

If that doesn't work then go ahead and file a formal complaint with your police department and get a restraining order if necessary.

hBKGxl8iaa	In most states there is a time limit in filing your signed license so if that time has lapsed then they have a problem. Tell them to call their local courthouse where the papers should have been filed to find out what the rules in your state are.|`|D9mKoSkyaa	Nope... they have to go through the whole process... If they ever filed a paper at all, then it is on record somewhere.  Especially if they were married out of their home state.

ER9LoAkraa	Hey that's funny your an M R too. I'm a guy in my mid 40's and did Match as well. I gave up on it.<br>  <br>  I could describe myself pretty much the same as you did (I'm better that average looking but in great shape). I see the same things - the same women with a few new women here and there. One thing you mentioned is your "rather stringent criteria". While I only know 1 other guy that did this we both agree that stringent criteria is a turn off. We see most women demanding quite a lot. High income, tall, younger than them, no kids at home... Even if I fit the criteria, it makes me think twice about writing. <br>  <br>  Both my friend and I rarely get responses to nice short emails expressing a response. So I'm guessing most people don't respond. We get infrequent emails as well. I think this would better if we were in the top 10. I've been told by women that they would never contact a guy 1st. In the 21st century that really surprised me. <br>  <br>  I conclude a majority of the people on these sites are very superficial and are many times on there just to look. I have went on a number of dates most were not good, a couple went very well and I dated one woman for a year. I'm still friends with her too. I've found most people are quite different in person compared to there on-line persona. <br>  <br>  Personally, my particular problems are I have younger children and am only 5' 8". I've been told this is a problem many times from women. I never knew this was such an issue! <br>  <br>  So, you are likely experiencing what most people experience. The internet is a place were people can be rude and disrespectful and suffer few if any concequences. I don't think there is any excuse to not reply as it only takes a minute.<br>  <br>  I saw the above answer. I don't know about E harmony but Yahoo is the same as Match IMHO.|`|XecQnoPsaa	to be honest, i'm not over 50 (i'm only 20) and i've never been on match.com, but i've heard from other family members that going on <a href="http://www.eHarmony.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.eHarmony.com</a> is the best bet....and the yahoo singles network is also a good choice. i haven't heard many good reviews from match at all....

0NQ9P2Ozaa	I am only two years older than you but guys do that when they like someone (would you stare at a guy if you disliked him?). And about the last part .. when a guy asks me if like his friend (and I know I do) I don't say yes because I am afraid of rejection. Everyone is afraid of being rejected,right? And maybe he is shy.. trust me, I know many guys who act very macho and cool but they are very shy and sensitive people. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you think he likes you try to say Hi when you meet and smile at him.

Claro que influyen mucho las costumbres religiosas y tradiciones religiosas.<br>  <br>  Como ejemplo, yo soy varon y me gustan mucho las mujeres, tanto que de 10 mujeres que veo, 8 me gustan, por una cosa u otra. Me gusta mucho admirar la belleza sutileza de una mujer. YO SIMPRE HE DICHO QUE SI DIOS CREEO ALGO MAS BELLO QUE LA MUJER, SE LO QUEDO PARA EL.

Esa es una pregunta de doble sentido y, por tanto, debe ser hecha por ambos cónyuges. <br>  Hace muchos a?os leí un libro, que aún conservo, que decía algo así:<br>  "No siento que se haya ido el amor, si no de que se haya ido de tan poco". <br>  Cuando se escribió este libro, la mujer trabajaba, principalmente, en sus labores, como se decía. Hoy esa circunstancia ha cambiado y afecta a ambos miembros de la pareja. La solución que proponía era muy sencilla:<br>  Que el uno despida al otro cuando se va de casa y lo reciba cuando vuelve, si coinciden, claro está.<br>  Que si alguno se enfada mucho, que el otro tape su boca con un beso en ella. Recordar los cumplea?os y otras cositas.

2WYga1G3aa	Your doing all you can, why are you trying to patch stuff up with her though she sounds really horrible, like you said she has never been nice, i am sure you have loads of other friends so just with them until she calms down and realises what she's lost as a best friend, then she will come running back to you. If she doesnt, so what? you have your group of mates and an amazing boyfriend!! This girl sounds awful, your better without her. But then it's up to you.<br>  one word: Jelousy, it's obvious, bet she's single isnt she? <br>  <br>  good luck hun xxx|`|KBFOaEMJaa	get away from her .seems you gain a (boy) friend but lost a friend. to tell you the truth youshouldn'tt tell her that you' ll get friends with her ex.|`|9PKyOE1Gaa	That really bites. <br>  <br>  First - when she said yeah, it was fine...I doubt she really meant it, not deep down anyway. I think she'd be a bit jealous that you're with her ex because it didn't work out between them. And seeing that you're happy with him...that probably gets to her but she hasn't talked to you about it because she didn't want you to feel bad. I'm guessing her calling him names is part of the jealousy, and she's maybe trying to convince herself she doesn't like him anymore - but maybe part of her still does? Hence she kept going on about how horrible he was...<br>  <br>  About the fight...if she made fun of you because you wear glasses, I don't think she's the sort of friend you wanna hang out with. But if she's joined a group, it looks like she's doing things to fit in around them - and if they don't like you...unfortunately for you that means she's turned on you. <br>  <br>  If you really don't want to let go of your friendship, try asking her if you guys can talk. Tell her exactly how you feel about how she's been treating you, and ask her to be honest with you. If she throws it back in your face...then really, she isn't a friend at all and I'd let the friendship go and find people who won't treat you badly, because you don't deserve it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)

HnsgTAezaa	That's not unfair. There has to be a physical attraction to the person you're having sex with, and I think it's perfectly reasonable for someone to ask their significant other to take care of themselves.|`|cdf5a788e792f88054c9718b767854adaa	How long have you been with him? I think that you should be a bit more considerate of his feelings before you state it that way. Like it has been said before maybe you should exercise with him and try to break it to him politely *if possible in this matter* that you want him to take better care of himself for you to have sex with him. However if you are in a serious relationship and you truly love him it shouldn't disgust you. Is this the first time you have had sex, and did he weigh as much when you got together? I think if you weren't attracted to him to begin with you shouldn't have had sex with him in the first place. |`|Mv0Ffq4laa	i guess you are in line because you are trying to have an open and honest relationship with your man.  but at the same time, if your sex is grossing you out then you clearly don't love him, so why try to whip him in shape?  not trying to destroy your relationship or anything...<br>  then again on the other hand sex burns calories, so you can just follow his lead and let him loose the weight the way he wants to.<br>  Best of luck |`|St4TxwvXaa	I probably wouldn't word it like that.

If you don't like his weight, you shouldn't be with him, tell him to excersize and if he doesn't then maybe he's not the one.|`|1pQpn7ZRaa	yeah just tell him that he needs to lose some. but dont tell him that sex is gross with him. thats pretty mean. i mean if i was fat and my girl told me that, id be pretty hurt for a while|`|G4UP1OCJaa	Tell him to lose weight he is your boyfriend he will appreciate the honesty and im sure he doesnt want you to be disgusted when your being intimate with him.|`|2QlgSkkSaa	More often you see good looking girls with fat guys than good looking guys with fat girls. So either deal with it or get a new boyfriend.|`|cv5PYXEIaa	No. <br>  I bet he will definitely lose some wait because he will be more than determined.<br>  <br>  :]]<br>  good luck.!|`|7454b58a83708f2e8746175f16fdb64faa	Ask him to exercise with u<br>  enter a weight loss goal for both of u.|`|AA10956801	I agree w/ u....and i dont think is inappropriate
mbT3chfKaa	let me tell you something i have had 3 really good friends who were in the same situation you are now. okay honestly there is no way to practice... there are some people who go to a certain extent for example kissing your mirror or practicing on your hand but none of that works. the only way to do it is to try how you think you do it and practice with him. if you really liek him and he really likes you then he wont mind teaching you how, trust me, hes a guy. if you want a few pointers i could help you. i started out as being terrible at kissing but i just practiced with one of my x boyfriends and listen i started out with no idea but now every guy i kiss tells me im really good and it even made a few guys who didnt like me before .. like me. its not hard just remeber to pucker! thats the key thing really but when it comes to making out theres a whole other technique. post another question if you need help with that and ill do the best i can. sorry if thats not very helpful but its just a normal kiss. just pucker and practice it will all work out fine!|`|z8qdz9WFaa	try kissing your teddy bear. im jk. idk how to help u. sorry|`|apzcHqriaa	alright well first try to calm down, like maybe even pretend your in a dream and like it's not real so it's not as difficult. and then just be natural , and kiss him. just pucker up, orrr if its making out just give him some tongue. its hard to do when its your first kiss but, ull get used to it. =)|`|uurEuk2naa	ok just start to kiss him it will come naturally open your mouth a little and if he gives tongue open more you'll get  used to it |`|3labUyMOaa	Just don't go straight forward to making out that is bad take it slow. Don't worry it'll be alright you'll find your own technique.
KCEZVHgDaa	come clean with her and tell her in person. go to her house,knock on her door and spill your heart out.<br>  goodluck!
gbWKXP9Gaa	i have to admit that does sound like a lot, but when does many become too many? If he's clear of stds etc, and you like him, I would say what the hell. besides he should have a lot of experience in the bedroom.|`|uRHXFloWaa	OMG!!Your boyfriend is a MALE WH*RE!!|`|rE1UjNdbaa	I don't think it's a matter of good and bad I think it's about safety.  Since he has had many partners, he is at a higher risk for disease... I say both of you get tested before doing anything sexual and then don't be worried by his past... it's in the past.|`|f7ieZtikaa	This is reall talk and straight to the point<br>  <br>  Women with 18 lovers = Hoe<br>  <br>  Men with 18 lovers = Normal<br>  <br>  Check if hes got std before you get with him :)|`|XzsQdMUHaa	Personally...that just seems off to me. <br>  My ex had 12 before me...and now he's single after his 18th. <br>  And he's only 18...<br>  so I guess it's all up to you to decide.

I learned this through experience. <br>  If you ***** at each other, you're only gonna misunderstand each other and then things will only get more annoying than it is now.|`|QYW12oylaa	so do you wanna stay friends with this girl? she's obviously getting jealous because her crush fancies you + u like him back, so try not to talk about him to her + if she tries to then change the subject. Tell her the truth - that she's really annoying you and her acting like you isn't gonna change anything with this guy - she needs to get over him if she wants to stay friends with you x|`|Zug1V0AKaa	I think that you need to re-evaluate both friendships: the one with this girl and the one with this guy. A quick way to lose her as a friend is to turn on her and start dating him. If he is more important, and you are already realizing that she isn't a friend that you would like to hang out with any longer, well, then I suppose that you should just tell her that straight out. <br>  <br>  If you really value her friendship, I would sit her down and tell her what you are noticing. Don't drag the other girls into it...just tell her that its annoying you. Ask her how she would feel if you started dating him. If she gets upset over the idea...you have a decision to make. She might have every right to be upset if you both are great friends.|`|j02udTtdaa	Give her a pice of your mind.|`|U7SnmcxYaa	Tell the guy? or tell her to stop.|`|is2KFohbaa	You should tell her how you feel and talk to him two. <br>  There's no point braking friends but this is unreasonable good luck with the boy ;) and her|`|iSSCBTiMaa	i would say do what makes you happy, if she isnt happy with it, she isnt a true friend
yVlZKHTuaa	Needless to say if his feelings for you got to serious too fast, he is putting his schooling and thus career ahead of you.  I am not sure if he was looking for something serious when you started to date.  Many Graduate Med students go to a school in a completely different location than their undergrad.  It is hard to say that because he does not know what the future holds, he is playing it safe for both your sakes.  I have a friend that is still good friends with an ex, but he ended things because she started getting too serious and clingy too fast.  Since I do not know him, I cannot tell if he really did get the same serious feelings you have for him.  If he gets another girlfriend soon, I'd have to say the seriousness was one-sided.  If his feelings are serious, I think you still have a chance, but be aware that he is most likely to go where school and work takes him.  Thus your chance won't be until afterward when he starts his career.  Are you willing to wait 4+ years for him?  You can make a statement (do it more jokingly), "Let's make a pact.  If both of us are not married by the time you are thirty, then let's get hitched."  See what his reaction is.  |`|YgcLYx10aa	I don't know where there is any heartbroken in this situation now. I said this because this guy has been sincere enough with you and also childish. is it his sincerity or childish attitude that is heartbroken to you?<br>  Most of the time girls would want to die for a guy because of physical appearance or just mare infatuation. If you are sure you do not belong to this category, forget about this guy and move on, there are several equally good guys out there that would be more matured and love you for who you are.<br>  But if you think you can cope being a friend to him and not thinking about your present heart broken situation, go ahead and continue being a friend. on the other hand, if you know you cannot cope seeing him and not having him, then move on.<br>  <br>  <br>    |`|plVXnjyVaa	A bowl of Cheerios!|`|REB4FChQaa	Well that is if you are willing to wait around.  It seems he can not handle life…so it may not be a good idea for you to wait around for him...then when you guys do decide to try the relationship again...some other life issue comes up then what.  He'll be a doctor then and that itself will be an excuse because he'll need to dedicate his time to his patients.  To me it just kind of seems like an excuse, I have actually used a similar excuse to get out of a relationship in the past. To spare the other persons feelings.  Maybe he really does think you are a cool girl but the chemistry is not there on his end.  Its a cop out, don't wait...just search for some one who can give you their all because that is what you deserve.
TpNHTevSaa	you should make new friends! friends are everywhere! just be careful who you hang out with!|`|jcNtqbZOaa	Hello<br>  <br>  Im going though the same only i moved country and i don't get to see my friends like you i was dead popular.Im guessing you are still at school?Do you find you have friends but they is no one you really click with or could be your best friend!All i can say is look on the bright side at least you get to see them.Maybe try join a sports team or something.Maybe make an effort it may seem to you are trying but deep down your not cause you wanna go live where you used to so your not really trying are you?<br>  <br>  I know what you mean about seeing fotos of your mates its like they have moved on and your jst stuck.<br>  <br>  Keep your head up. xxx|`|XCrcItD3aa	Hello, my friend,<br>  <br>  I understand how you feel. I think you need to go out in the community<br>  where you are and meet people. To meet people we have to go out let alone meeting friends.<br>  <br>  I think you should go to the supermarkets, go to the stores, say "hi" to people that may interest you.<br>  <br>  I dont know if it is convenient to walk in your neighbourhood in the morning for some exercise, you could join a gymn, a club, a group etc.|`|UywxrfGdaa	O dont be sad now x u need a big cuddle!! your just stuck in a moment thats all. i dont no how old you are but when i moved sumwer new i got a job in a local pub and got to no new poeple. if you are younger than 18 how about a part time job in the pub restaurant? waitress? sumtimes you need to put yrself out to make change in yr life even if the effort seems too much x take care now x il b yr friend x x|`|9PKyOE1Gaa	I think I know how you feel a little bit. I moved away 6 months ago when I came to Uni and I haven't really made many friend, and I've only really got the one guy who I hang out with outside of Uni - so I feel really really lonely! Because everyone else seems to have at least a couple of other friends. And all my old school friends are still back at home and I see photos of them on facebook going out and having a good time, and here's me...on my own...missing out on it all. Gets me really down sometimes :(<br>  <br>  But it must be hard having moved away and not having people to turn to. I'm guessing you probably get on with the people you work with, but as you say...there isn't a lot of people your age. I think...if you wanna meet people your age...you gotta think about what things you like. Are you into sports? Art? Drama? Music? I dunno! You could join a gym, dance class or something...anything to get you out of the house. Even if you don't meet new friends straightaway, at least it will build on your confidence - cus it sounds as if you maybe lack a little confidence. But that's maybe because you've been feeling alone for the last year.<br>  <br>  Don't know if that's any help, but good luck :)|`|v9PhCTotaa	Im exactly the same! i moved away just like 5 miles from all my friends and that was it, im lucky if i see them once a year now.<br>  Funny thing is, when i say that im doing my car lisence, they all say "yay you can come see me then!" i feel like saying why the **** should i go see your lazy *** youve been driving for 3 years lol???<br>  it annoys me to see all my friends goin out clubbing and stuff, and no-one even considers to ask me.<br>  Ive made one friend since i moved away but since then shes moved away too lol, shes the only one i will bother going to see, seeing as she doesnt drive its not her fault.<br>  Honestly though, i have no idea how to make new friends, im a nice person and i try my best to get on with people, but no-one ever seems interested.<br>  But if you find an idea that works, message me id love to know!
0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	Yeah, I'm 22, so I'm not giving you my screen name.
44QPXU5eaa	Why did you go visit? He must have done something wrong to end up in jail so this is the perfect time to move on with your life. Do not keep putting yourself in the position to get heart from him anymore. Follow through with the divorce and find a decent man.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	hes in jail but you pay .. no more ger rid of him .sorry but its over .. get that in your head ... now move on .. for get him .. and make it happen .. leave the jurk to him self then .. ok|`|vGH9ghiKaa	Just turn around and walk away, let it be a lesson learned,  It's time to grow up.

If you feel low and like your not worth anything then your less likely to cheat on him or leave him. I would wait til the attorney has the divorce papers ready and then act very nice and like nothing is wrong. Just let it all roll off of you and when you go to see him that is when you drop the divorce papers on him. Now is your chance to get out of a very abusive relationship. Since he is in jail and doesn't need the home for the time being you will get to keep it and then you can buy his half if his name is even on it. Vehicles and things like that are the same. This is your chance to find someone who will love you for who you are and no matter what. You deserve better. You can go and find the man of your dreams and start all over. With someone who is willing to stand beside you not in front of you.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	You need to get the man out of your life for good and what he is doing is abusing you. It sounds like he blames you for being in jail. I was married to a man who would always scream at me about anything that did not go his way. I got very fed up with arguing all the time and we are now divorced. He came into the room to see you at the jail so he could get into another argument with you and then blame you some more. The man is not worth it and you need to have a peaceful life without him in it.|`|cdQryr7paa	Excuse me, but why would you go visit him??<br>  If all he can do is insult you and treat you like crap, why would you run to him, especially when he is sitting in jail.<br>  And you are paying for all the phone calls when he calls you from jail as well.<br>  Unhook the dam phone and quit going to visit him would be a good start.<br>  Better yet, tell the jail he is harassing you on the phone so that they don't allow him to call you anymore.<br>  To me he is acting just like the criminal he is, that's why he is sitting in jail.<br>  Your actions are the ones that confuse me.<br>  Get a lawyer and get the divorce, and when / if he gets out get a restraining order against him so he has to stay away.<br>  Life is too short to live like this, and do you really need a man in your life that is in and out of jail and treats you like crap?<br>  You are the only one capable of changing your situation.<br>  If you don't, it's very hard for me to feel sorry for someone that keeps going back for more abuse when they have the ability to get out of the relationship.|`|th7C1aoaaa	easy solution do a crime and get arrested and ask if you can be in the same cell. Move on.|`|0EB2ZR0Gaa	I don't think you need to concern yourself about whether he will call.  You should get a different phone number and pick up where you left off with the lawyer.  After the divorce is final, maybe you could relocate somewhere he doesn't know about. <br>  <br>  Imagine the foolishness of allowing someone who is in jail to abuse you!<br>  He cannot do that unless you help him, you know.  Just cut out the phone calls and visits and if he sends mail, mark it : "Unknown at this address.  Return to sender."<br>  <br>  Stick up for yourself, but don't waste any of your time doing it where he can see it.  Just treat yourself well.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	It seems you and your husband both want/need each other..but since your bashing heads, your arguments which display stubbornness is getting in the way of you both resolving matters in a mature way. You both should just give each other time...I am sure you both will come round it. See it as this is time for you and your husband to begin to deal with things in a mature matter.<br>  <br>  For now just do your thing and allow him to ease down with his frustrations because i am sure being in jail is adding to him behaving in such manner. Think about it...he is locked up 24/7 so he is bound to give up, have a temper, be on edge, have hostility in him.|`|7XIa76Usaa	His actions mean one of two things. #1 He really does not want to be with you anymore. #2 He is deeply hurt because he knows he has hurt you and doesn't want you to set and want until he gets out. My advice is for you to ask him to contact the Chaplin at the facility and ask for a Bible start reading it.  John 3; V17|`|AA11265589	First of all stop accepting collect calls to be berated.  Prison does things to people.  They change.  To be in prison and survive requires a certain disposition that is not easily turned off.  The visiting hall is a scary place.  Once he enters the room, several things are happening.  There may be other women there.  There are other prisoners that he has told lies to also.  So you don't know what that is about.  Why not let him do his time and when he is released you can sit and talk in a sane atmosphere and sort out your lives.  One of the major things you have to deal with men in prison is they still want to be in control.  They have no control on the inside, so they attempt to control the loved one on the outside.  Don't let a collect call control you.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	Why did you go visit him!?!?!  You are letting him abuse you again & again & again.  Take control of your life - Im sorry to say that your husband does not love or respect you.  Have no further contact with him, maybe he was once a good guy but he is not worth your tears now.  You must make a life for yourself without him in the picture.|`|naequcqlaa	GIRLFRIEND......read what all these people are telling you...Does it ALL sound familiar to you?  Have you heard all this before by someone who "cares" about you???  Get out of it all now while you have the chance...

On again off again and then back and forth. Jail does that and so does separation I guess. But you two need to decide for sure if it's on or off and stick to it and deal with the jail time and so on if it's on. If it's off then go your own way and let him rot so to speak. It really is simple. He is in a bad place and is lashing out. You are alone and are miserable and in love. It is the way it works when life is what it is for you right now. You two can work together and make it so much easier or work against each other like you are doing now and both be miserable. See what I mean? (smile) Do what your heart tells you to do.|`|m5CqJbYDaa	This is a question I can answer from expierience. I dont know what the reasons hes in there for and really its none of my buisiness,but after reading what other people here have to say I think its time you heard from someone whose done the time and knows what its really like! If he was good to you when he was out and I dont meen some of the time I meen pretty much all the time,ya know respectful,understanding,the normal things in a relationship,then what your dealing with is a man whose hurt because he left you all alone possibly again for something stupid or maybe even something that wasnt actually his fault,so by acting this way he's trying to push you away so you can find someone who wont hurt you in the same way,look at it this way,how long is he gonna be gone,and whats the crime? If its for a few years he doesnt want you to be alone or have to take the chance of you cheatin on him and finding it out later,so to save from the heart break of it he'll end it now by being an a__hole towards you,to piss you off enough at him, so itll be easier for you to leave and find someone new! If he was a good man to you before he went in and showed you that love you wanted then take it from me hes doing this because he loves you and doesnt want you to be alone anymore,he has no control where he is, but the one thing he does is loving you and trying to find you happiness,only problem is its the wrong way, If he was a good man to you dont let him go, hes just confused and lost like no one knows unless they've been in that situation and needs you more then you know,exspecially how much you love him,that cant be said enough,but if he was an controling SOB,then women you better get out while you sill can cause hes never gonna change only get worse from where hes at,people like that learn new ways to manipulate women and control them like youd never believe from incarceration!! So its real simple if he was a good man before it, chances are he'll come out the same way or  more grateful to you for waiting,if he wasnt and you stay, your in for one hell of a nasty ride,so use your mind girl not your heart or fear!!   ****SWEET MILDRED SENT ME TO HELP YOU***|`|uauJyxJNaa	You need to call that attorney back and file for divorce.  First of all sweetie, the slug is sitting in jail.  He probably has no where to put his wedding ring without it being stolen.  Secondly, he treats you like crap.  Why do you keep running to him?  Get some self esteem.  Don't give this loser another chance to make YOU feel bad about HIS miserable life.  You deserve better.<br>  <br>  Once a loser, always a loser.|`|zifEvqy2aa	Well to begin with he is in jail so he cant be with you, If it were me I would tell him,  you need a partner that is a law abiding citizen and that hes right he cant be with you because he violated the law then I would tell him he is the bad person not me it proves by him being in jail then tell him you will not live this way and you are done.
lNT22A0Caa	okay look...i'm not trying to be mean in this response, but this is what generally happens...<br>  <br>  basically, when a guy i've never met in person starts talking to me online, i'm generally nice and talk to him (just cuz i dont wanna be mean). but then he starts talking to me more and more and MORE so that EVERY time i get online he's ALWAYS chatting with me. but i'm too nice to tell him to go away so i just talk to him.  then he starts to suggest "hanging out." again, i'm too nice to tell him no, so i just say "okay maybe sometime..." hoping that he'll forget or something (because afterall i don't really know this guy, why does he want to hang out?) then if he actually does suggest hanging out, i might make up an excuse because it will be super awkward if we actually hung out.<br>  <br>  basically, i think she was just talking to you to be nice to you, and she eventually decided enough was enough. i honestly don't mean that to be mean, but maybe you should just forget about it.<br>  <br>  plus, the internet isn't really the place to make real friends.

hCZPRKOraa	I've graduated from High School and went through college to realize that it's not all about social cliques like it is when we're young. I used to date in my normal social group, but once I started getting out and meeting new people, I found myself attracted to all different types - not just those who wore the same types of clothes, listened to the same types of music, etc.<br>  <br>  I used to notice physical qualities and physical qualities only in a guy, but now I've learned to see past that, and "good looks" are just a plus, now.<br>  <br>  I look for a sense of humor. A mutual general understanding of common topics. An agreement on maybe not all, but certain beliefs. A guy who can have fun when not doing much at all. A guy who can stay in and have just as much of a good time. A guy who will leave me to go out with his friends, but return to me and not forget I exist. Not someone who will smother me with texts and calls, so as to give me my space as I give him his, but who doesn't hesitate to send the sweet message or give the random phone call just to see how I'm doing.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped. :]<br>  <br>  Xoxo.<br>  Bri.|`|7w3InrzDaa	The ability to put up with me extreme amounts of sarcasm.

XlOZRYWwaa	hmmm, thats a tuffy. Normally one will usually end up feeling for the other one.|`|0klCX1Ogaa	Totally.<br>  I have many attractive female friends but because I know that they are just friends I don't ever see them in a sexual way at all same as I don't see my male friends in a sexual way.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	Yes but it is very hard to remain platonic.  I have a friend guy but we rarely speak and rarely see each other.  We are just always in each others circle without connecting if you understand what I mean.  <br>  If a guy and girl start spending too much time together and always speaking to each other then there is an emotional bond that is unknowingly formed that can easily break down boundaries.|`|9PaRdlwcaa	Absolutely, it's been known to happen. If you happen to develop feelings for your friend, though, it's normal too. Maybe the reason you're such good friends is because you would fit together nicely as a couple and have similar interests.|`|ZKsSnT64aa	If they are mature enough then yes they can.<br>  <br>  Im friends with alot of girls and because I see them as sisters,I could NEVER do anything with them EVER.<br>  <br>  My fiancee is cool with this because she has guy friends and Im cool with that.<br>  <br>  We are 2 adults who trust each other|`|4wElyXcraa	Absolutely!!
9PKyOE1Gaa	Ooo, it depends. I mean...you gotta let him have his friends but then again, if he's spending time with her going to the cinema and doesn't take you as often then I'd be a little jealous, sure!<br>  <br>  You'd need to think about why though...I mean, what kind of films do they go see? And why aren't you going with them/him? <br>  <br>  If it's a film you don't wanna see and he does...and his female friend does then that's probably cool. But if he's not asking you..I'd find it odd.<br>  <br>  I'd bring it up in a conversation though, just to see what he said or hint I'd like to go with him to the cinema more :)|`|NXA4fJbTaa	yup pretty much. <br>  talk to him about it tho<br>  good luck <br>  x|`|IGXE3aDraa	lol yeah|`|3ylgyqGbaa	Kinda-depends on why he wouldnt want to take me and take her instead.|`|5db88cbaf3527eb6e504255901eb58cfaa	Uh, yes!|`|kdmGZn8taa	of course not he should be able to hang out with other people<br>  * a lot of sarcasm*|`|58ScqWG3aa	Yea,but if the only reason why he goes more with her than me was because I'm not always available then I would understand.|`|RtxKqeMFaa	If yur trying to get rid of him, then yes.

VBJOR4YRaa	Your lucky in the way that your still together and are both working on the issues that put you both in this situation. My ex divorced me cause of her affair and I think she is still not happy w/herself cause now I don't even communicate with her.<br>  The two of you will get through this especially if he is putting such effort into doing so.<br>  Remember how you two were when you met ? That is what you need to rebuild this love and trust for each other. Have dates go to dinner and movies together and rebuild that strong attraction for each other. You will never forget but you will learn as time goes on that he wants this to work and that is satisfaction enough. Have faith in the fact that he is trying, that says a lot more then you'll ever know. Stop living in the past when you think of bad feelings think of other happy things, it will be fine. Stay strong and keep your chin up !! Never stop the COMMUNICATION !!!|`|B359bLqsaa	I'm very sorry to hear that.  You are torturing yourself with what your husband did and I totally don't blame you because I would do the same thing.  I would tell  my husband if that was happening.  I would let him know exactly how sad and horrified I am at what he has done.  If he is truly remorseful then he will understand and will want to help you get through this.  What you need is lots of love, lots of reassurance, and lots of time.  You need to be able to talk about it and get it out so it will stop eating at you on the inside.  If your marriage is truly stronger now, then he should be strong enough to handle your intense sadness.|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	it will take time to forgive and forget. <br>  i just take one day at a time and try to make the present what it is about now,|`|veZLfnGFaa	You have to forget about this.  If he is trying, you should, too.  Don't stress over this - it's the past.  Focus on the future and work on this marriage.  If he's working so hard to fix everything, you should put that much effort into forgetting.  Good Luck :)|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	You don't forget, ever.  But after a while, you can forgive.  Neither though, is truly trusting him.  That will take years probably.|`|UJD2eYebaa	You might find the Betrayed Spouses Support board at iVillage.com helpful for your situation.  Good luck - hope it gets better for  you.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	I understand just what you are saying a few years ago the same thing happened to me, and he denied any thing was going on and it was the biggest mess, I could not do any thing because his brother had just died the day I found out  because she called my house. and his mother had had her legs amputated the week before and I was taking radiation for breast cancer,so I had to maintain my composure even that I was mad as hell, I have never truly forgiven him and I will never forget and I am still not over it, and it is still ruining my life,I feel hurt and betrayed to this day and even that we have talked about it his continuing to say that nothing ever happen except they were friends, I feel you don't have friends in a marriage your spouse can't meet, I don't have the closeness with him I used to, I hold grudges and I don't forgive easy, but it has caused a bitter streak in me and a unsure where I stand place with him, I try every day to move on but it is not working, but as much hell as I raised then I don't feel he will try that again, and what also made mine so bad to me, was that we had a small restaurant and she had been in it and bought things from me so she knew me and I had no ideal who she was,I never went back to my own place of business and closed it. so he allowed some one to destroy my sense of comfort.you will have to find some way to forgive him not for him but for you but don't forget it, this situation caused me to drink a lot and argue with him more because I was hurting and if he had said he was sorry when I would lose it that would of helped,and if I could of seen her I think that could have helped, just as you say she still haunts me and I also wonder about his friends who come to my house and are suppose to be my friends to. do they know, did they feel sorry for me, so try to move on and talking about it helps as you can find something that helps you  in the way other relate when this happens to them, I feel you know what is really troubling you, try and work on that and picture her as a reall tramp, she did things that you would not and he did not leave you for her so she was nothing, and continue to ask God to help you get past this and you don't have to forget to put far back in the folders within your brain. I will you good luck sister in this journey but in time this to will pass.|`|UGOse5Dvaa	Get help. talk to a friend.

Why do you think you don't deserve your husband or his devotion?  Why are you looking for negative things to think about?  There's a deeper problem here that's not being addressed.  You're definitely on the right track by being aware of the nasty habit.  Sometimes you just have to choose not to have those thoughts, as hurtful as they may be.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	It is so easy to forgive but forgetting is another thing.  Only time will help to soften that blow.  Its been a couple of months for me too and it is still an open wound.  It does not bite as much as it did say the first couple of weeks after but the pain is still there.  <br>  My husband is also 100% remorseful and repentant.  His life is now open but everytime I look at him I still ask myself how he could have done it and not be sorry at the time he was doing it.<br>  Hang in there and be strong and be happy and successful.  Live, Laugh, Love.|`|niq3ETl0aa	I've been there. Wish i had the answer. I moved out of my boyfriends house and never found out who the women were. I moved out within thwo weeks of finding out for sure. Then the pain wasn't looking me in the face everyday. But we weren't married. Whatever you are feeling is normal. Get counseling, the two of you. It may not work. Be ready for that. You may have to get divorced. But it won't be your fault, OK? I told him almost immediately that I forgave him. Because I truly did. But forgiving and trusting are two diff. things. if there are no children involved do what you want. And even if there are, you're going to have to overcome this obstacle one way or the other.|`|AA10531706	I really don't have the answer for you.  I am in the same situation.  He has asked me to forgive him and I have, but I can't forget.  I think about it everyday for the simple reason that I blame myself for being so trusting and I feel like I had been blind or missed something during that time.  I also feel that my husband should go over and beyond the call of duty to help me get my feelings back, but he doesn't.  It is weird.  We actually get along for the most part and during these economic times (I lost my job) I have to hang in here and hope things get better.  My feelings for him are -- I love him but not in love with him and I think he feels the same way.  We do talk, but nothing ever gets resovled.  I feel that the working he is doing on our marriage is acting.   He seems to be trying too hard and frankly it annoys me.|`|OF8V34LPaa	i fully support you staying together as long as its for love.i know alot of people that stay together because of children and all the wrong reasons but if u truely love him then thats great,we're all human,we all make mistakes and trust can be too easily broken because there are too many rules in life.i know a couple who have been married for years and he cheated on her a few years ago,she had a breakdown because of it a year later because it was still on her mind so much.the point is they stuck it out,worked on it and are now truely happier than they have ever been.it happens.i think you have every right to feel the way you do and the fact its playing on your mind on a daily basis is completely natural and you shouldnt try to block it out,its like a grieving process,if u ignor eit it will catch up on you later.so its best to go through all the pain now while working on your trust and marrage,i promise it will make you stronger,if you try to block out the emotions you re efectively blocking him out and it will come back to haunt you in the future.i have been through this myself,and trust me,it does get better,it took me a year and now i am so much happier and relaxed because its almost like the worst has been done it couldnt get any worse so there is nothing to worry about.i also know people who have had sex therapy,i know it sounds odd but they work on every aspect of your relationship,trust being the biggest part and it also gives you so much confidence you wont be worrying about that other woman,you will just feel great in yourself like you are the winner,its worth looking into.i know i have rambled and i hope it hasnt bored you,i wish you the best of luck.x
1k7LIZVWaa	Yes, you have to follow what the papers say.  If the papers say he has to pay support, he has to do that too.  Take him to court if he's not paying.  He should be allowed to see his children.  They are not pawns.  It isn't like he should only see them if he pays and not if he doesn't.  There are legal consequences when someone doesn't follow court order.  If you have no interest in seeing him to pick up or drop off the kids, see if a family member can help you out.<br>  <br>  I doubt the girlfriend will ever truly come before the kids, he just said that to get you.<br>  <br>  You are acting like a child and so is he.  Get over it and act like you are the adults you are supposed to be.  Be a good role model to your son and rise above these petty fights.|`|SsfnitjXaa	It is not a law in any state that a man has to pay to see his own son.  Why are you denying the child a father?  Give the guy a chance to be a father, he is not askng to be a husband.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	If he has court ordered visitation then YES. You must make the child available to see the father.<br>  <br>  The issues you have with him have nothing to do with your child's visitation.<br>  <br>  I suggest you contact the child support agency to get them to chase him up about his late payments.<br>  <br>  As for the girlsfriend contacting you.......this is classed as harassment. You should contact the police, and have them contact her to stop. If that doesn't work you should file for a restraining order against her.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	His girlfriend should not be involved in this, you can make police reports on what she is doing to you in communicating and what he is doing..don't allow him to control you..you can file harassment charges against them both..stop communicating with him altogether..don't enter into his stuff..if he has issues with seeing his son, then let him take you back to court then you can prove to the judge what he has been doing to you..but if you feel that you son is in danger or unsafe from his father or you feel unsafe..file for a restraining order against him now.|`|QUCIdBp5aa	Yes!  Absolutely.  He still has the right to see his child, too.<br>  <br>  Don't punish him when he's neglected support.  It can be held against YOU!  <br>  <br>  That's what the Court is for.  If you haven't filed for Enforcement, do so immediately.|`|d8zxbKduaa	For the sake of your son I would do it. Your son will grow up longing to know his dad otherwise. He may be a jerk, but let your son develop his own opinion of him.|`|7LWDRI2Uaa	If the father wants to see his son and you have agreements made for visitation then yes you do have to follow that. Money does not equal getting the right to see your child. There are other methods to pursue to get the money. The new girlfriend isn't your concern and I would make it clear that if she should continue to contact you, you'll go after her for harassment, other than that don't acknowledge her existence, and don't use your child as a weapon no matter how much you dislike the father.|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	No, especially if your son doesnt want to go. Now you cat withhold your son from visiting his father because of unpaid child support. Only a court can legally do that so be careful how you tell him youre not sending his son to him or you could end up in hotter water|`|IfOTZhQyaa	A court order is a court ORDER. You have to or else you will get into trouble that you don't need. You can take him back to court for none child support and try to change the court order. But until then you have to follow the order of the court.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Whether you like it or not, YOUR SON NEEDS HIS FATHER!!!!!<br>  <br>  If you go to court, the answer will be he always has visitation, regardless of paying child support.  btw, get them to take it out of his check!!<br>  His son needs him!!!!<br>  Don't punish your son because you picked the wrong guy to be his father!!|`|cKKUViZCaa	Yeah... visitation and support are independent of each other.  Do NOT stop him from seeing the kids, but take him to court over the support.  If he doesn't show up, you can garnish his wages.|`|8ilHQMq5aa	i dont think he has any rights if he isnt paying the child support|`|BqqDJXkjaa	You're both acting stupidly. Work it out.|`|OXohgDoJaa	You must follow the courts papers to the letter or you will be in violation. It doesn't matter what you want, what your son wants or what your ex hubby wants, the court has ordered visitation so you must make your son available. Its up to your ex to see him or not. We had a similar situation but much worse and the courts ordered my niece to see her father who only wanted to stir up trouble in the family and cared nothing for his child. Your only hope is to get him to sign away his parental rights, then visitation can be canclled by the courts. But, he can get locked up in jail for not paying child support.|`|Cpwedckvaa	Yes, you do. Court orders are court orders...if you violate them it can bite you in the butt later....Also, money doesnt make a parent. I know what it is to be a single mother and not get the help that you need with your kids but you need to remember that money doesnt make a parent! From what I am reading he seems like a real winner but that isnt for you to show your son...be the bigger person and do what you need to do.|`|K4MuUaqiaa	Absolutely.<br>  Child support and Visitation are two seperate issues.<br>  <br>  Mothers like yourself should rot in hell.|`|srAjGDjJaa	Every man deserves to see his child you have to try to think its not for him its for the child... Who knows maybe eventually he'll grow up...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PS. Sweet Mildred sent me to help you

He can take everything that is of value (minus the kids of course). He can take the house, car, etc. I know I am capable and able to care for myself and my children if I end up a single mother.

I am not asking for any money after or during divorce. I am back to school having no or little money. he has a good job right now.<br>  I JUST WANT HIM TO GO TO HELL WITH MY MONEY.

Have a baby or two, gain a few pounds, he's off at work with the secretary. Next thing ya know, he's shacking up with her and because the babies would interfere, you have them and the daycare bill.  You're stuck in a house you can't afford with children who require more energy than you have. And the bills you can't pay. Things aren't important. It isn't necessarily because she's female. It could be that she's just of low moral character.|`|AA11538662	I am a wife and an ex-wife and I have NEVER nor would I do such a thing. My ex and I actually parted as friends and I did NOT go after things I could have, for instance- his pension & spousal support and everything was split though he did give me the house free & clear but only he was a veteran and could buy another home for a lot less up front that I could (about $500.00 for him upfront).<br>  <br>  I do hate when women take men to the cleaners by taking EVERYTHING they somehow feel they are entitled to. Unless of course, he cheated, then he gets what he deserved because the easiest way to teach a lesson is through the pocketbook. But this works both ways of course.<br>  <br>  My hubby's ex cheated on him and even moved in with her boyfriend and lived with him for 1 year before a divorce was even filed, she was awarded spousal support for 24 months and a portion of his pension even though he had proof she cheated because my state (Michigan) seems to always be for the woman no matter what. And I guess the fact that his ex wife's father was a retired chief of police and I am wondering if he did not have an outside relationship with te judge that handled his divorce. And get this, the judge that handled this divorce was busted for soliciting sex in a mens room at the airport and somehow managed to keep his seat which IMO, is crazy. He is a public official and should know better than that.<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck and I hope all works out well for you.<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI.

And you can't stop anyone from saying anything they want, even when it's not true.  Hold your head high.  You've made a courageous decision that's going to be hard to follow through on.  A school counsellor can help.  Your parents can help.  And if worst comes to worst, you might want to change schools to get a fresh start.|`|9qqzRTpDaa	If one guy asks tell him you can't you have to meet your mom-dad another person, lie girl what ever you have to to get out of it, until they stop asking...they will, or tell them you have this boyfriend now and you can't  don't worry about the rumors because they talk already. so at least you be rid of these energy sucking leaches...I am really praying for you. Good luck, I know how hard this must be for you, be strong and know you are not alone.|`|UXf6g6Sjaa	Pretend that you have a mature grown up relationship (even though you do not) and just say that you need to break up. Say how much fun it was, and something like "I'm sure you'll remember the good times we had". Or "Our passion was just too intense to survive". The old "Lets just be friends" is kind of a cliche, though. Perhaps you could go out to dinner, and say this over desert.<br>  <br>  The point is to act in a mature fashion about the breakup, so as to minimize the rumor mongering. This will also be good practice for when you grow up. If you could find somebody about 25 years old to give you some hints and tips, that would be good, too.<br>  <br>  This is no substitute for counseling, it is just a way to reduce the amount of sex you are having. But it has worked for hundreds of years.|`|XF1y4wMmaa	You just tell them no! Be strong girl. You dont deserve this. Just dont listen to the rumors. You are doing the right thing by changing everything around. Dont give up. If they spread rumors then ignore them, Pretend they arent going around.<br>  You should also try talking to the friends that you lost during 7th grade. If they were really your good friends then they will forgive and forget!<br>  JUST REMEMBER TO BE STRONG AND NEVER GIVE UP!|`|aboQfYqeaa	Wow that is a difficult place you have put yourself in. But I don't think it's an impossible feat either.<br>  <br>  I think a good start would be to get yourself involved in a lot of school activities.  Concentrate on your school work, but keep active.  This will help you academically in the long run, but will also deter the sex crazy boys. You will start getting involved with people who are more serious about school and their education.  Then when these boys call you or ask you to "hang out" you can say "sorry I can't, I have a Student Council meeting" or "I have Volleyball practice" (if you're athletic), do see what I'm saying with that?  You will no longer be at their beckon call like you made yourself to them before.<br>  <br>  And most importantly NO MEANS NO!   Do not EVER allow any one person; man, woman, adult, child ANYBODY take advantage of you, your mind, your body, heart and soul.  You belong to YOU and YOU make the rules.  Who gives a damn what they say??  Those boys or anybody else.  Because trust me sweetie 10-20 years from now you will not ever hear from them again and it will not matter one bit.<br>  <br>  I suggest you make an appointment to speak to your school counselor and create a trust with him/her, feel comfortable talking to them.  Let them know your situation and they will have the tools to help you move forward.  I wish you the best of luck.<br>  <br>  |`|e454bdb66416d7041c98277d234eaee5aa	Is there anyway you can move schools? Sounds like you need to get invold with maybe choir or track or somthing, anyways, just tell the boys you are going to church or somthing, they may not get the hint at first but eventually they will, hang on to the friends you have and enjoy there company, three friends might not seem like alot of friends now but trust me in ten years youll think three is alot. |`|9a8pPJaLaa	You need to get professional help immediately.

Period. END of discussion. As much as the rumors will hurt, YOU will need to be strong, and hold your head up. Get to a counselor and talk about it if it helps you to cope.<br>  <br>  SLEEPING with ANY boy/man is never the answer to a bad day or going through things. I am NOT judging you. I just want to prevent it from happening AGAIN the next time you go through something and feel the need to "cope".<br>  <br>  You are a deserving young woman who should VALUE yourself and know that you are special. Save that for the one you LOVE when you are OLDER....|`|KqQlWbYsaa	You should go as soon as possible to your school guidance counselor: You should speak to the counselor very candidly about all that you have done to date; and about your wish to move your life in a new and healthier direction. There is nothing to be embarrassed about; and, in addition, if the counselor does determine that you can benefit from some professional help, you likely will be given a referral to a licensed psychologist or psychotherapist for the same.<br>  <br>  Eventually, as time goes on, your actions, or, rather, not acting, will speak loudly; and those at school will get the message loud and clear that you are now dancing to a different tune, so to speak.|`|YetOBaq8aa	If I was you, I wouldnt stop and I dont even care what they say cause I dont lik them and if they look at u in a mean way just put your middle finger up at them or roll your eyes.

WDNMaVDzaa	WOW!  I cannot even begin to imagine what you and your family have been through, but I can say that cutting off communication with your father is probably best at this time.  However, I believe you should tell him WHY you will not be taking his calls and WHY you will not be seeing him.  He is an adult, he made his own decisions and he needs to be held accountable for all the pain he has caused.  Tell him how you feel about him and path he chose to follow and then tell him that until he has gotten himself together and gotten his life straightened out, you will have nothing more to do with him.<br>  <br>  The worst thing you could do would be to enable your father to continue to destroy your life.  Enabling someone is the absolute worst thing you could do.  Your father needs to know that what he has done and is continuing to do is totally unacceptable and that you will not condone his behavior by continuing to have a relationship with him.  Does that make sense?  Your father thinks he can carry on with his pain medication addiction and not suffer any penalties with you.  That just isn't the case and he needs to be called on the carpet for it.  <br>  <br>  Break off communication with him AFTER you have told him what he has done and breaking your ties with him is just one of the consequences of his actions.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|5CGmDZ5Haa	drugs or no drugs, he is being  very disrespectful of you, i would tell him clean up your act and treat us with respect or get out...i have  similar situation, only its my brother...and my mother..only he doesnt abuse her he is cleaning out her bank account..pretty sad|`|NQoyNWaUaa	Intervention!!

No matter what you may think, you will miss him when he is gone...... Just my opinion..............|`|3IU58R69aa	If you aren't happy being around him, then don't be. I haven't had contact with my father or his parents for 20 years, because of things he did to me and my family, and I don't regret it for a second. I have forgiven my father and his parents for the things they have done, but I still choose not to be around them because it doesn't make me feel good. You have to choose for yourself what's right for you.|`|mYatJgXcaa	This is hard but in my experience with a father who was on drugs and not there, I would say stop being in contact with him. If talking to him hurts more than not being in contact then the choice is obvious. I haven't  spoken to my father in several years. There are times when he comes to mind but then I think of all he has done and well that 'dad' thing goes right out the window. Good luck. |`|L5xwMx9faa	I really feel for you, Honey.  This is always a tough one.  The first and foremost, as I see it, is YOU.  You must take care of YOU.  Do this for your own mental stability.  Second is to standby your mother and brother.  Reading into your story, I question the intent of why your dad wants to talk with you.  Could it be to weasel money from you, by getting you to feel sorry for him?  If so you will probably be dropped when you refuse.  (I assume you'll deny that request.)  I'm talking like this because I've seen this senerio before.  Two friends of mine had a similar situation, and that was the result both times.  <br>  I am trying to be as objective as possible without placing myself into it emotionally.  So much of the time, emotions and stable thinking don't match, and the result is a bad mistake that can be carried on for life.<br>  I believe that you are on the right track of thinking by not communicating with him.  Please be very cautious.<br>  PS..I have no doubt that he does love you, for whatever that is worth.|`|MOCBWQHhaa	Chronic pain is horrible 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. Pain pills don't take it away, they only make it bearable some of the time. Stress makes it worse.And it changes your personality for sure. Your dad probably had surgery to relieve the pain but surgery often times makes it worse. Taking pills daily does not make you an addict, misusing the pills you take does.<br>  <br>  Being human we think, act, talk relate to others through our emotions rather than rational thought or sanity. As a result we hurt the people closest to us the most and they hurt us too.That's all part of life That pain doesn't go away on it's own either. We could all use therapy to learn tools to communicate better but we don't. You can only do your best everyday, include the thought to not hurt other people. Your parents are you in a sense, they had a dream for a perfect happy life at one time too and real life changed that somehow. Everyone was a part of it so don't play the blame game. It's not what happened, it's how you deal with it that makes life what it is.|`|b6oMZIOnaa	Loves ponies is dead on.|`|GfNVcq7Naa	If being near him hurts you then don't be near him. But you have to tell him why tell him the truth about how you feel about him and that you just need some time.  But don't let it go for too long or you will regret it.|`|dxTwHB1yaa	I went through the exact, and I do mean the exact same issue with my father. <br>  <br>  Do not cut him out of your life. <br>  <br>  At this point your father is a sick man that needs help. It might be up to you to stage an intervention, otherwise you might find yourself with no father - as mine passed away from complications due to painkiller addiction. You do not want that guilt to haunt you for the rest of your life, as my brother wasn't speaking to my father when he passed and now has severe issues of closure and other issues. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://addictionintervention.com" rel="nofollow">http://addictionintervention.com</a><br>  <br>  This is a good website to help you figure out how to handle the situation. Sit down with your family members, and chose a time and place to have your father come, with an intervention specialist to discuss what can be done. Do this before the intervention, so there are no "figuring out the finer points" which will hamper the actual intervention.  There are state programs which will pay for rehabilitation and counseling services if you don't have insurance, or the insurance doesn't cover rehab. <br>  <br>  Remember this. He does love you. He does care for you, but when people are in the throes of addiction, their brain and feelings are mixed up, so despite caring, the internal conflict and chemicals they are introducing into their system will not allow them to make rational decisions or thoughts. <br>  <br>  I know you're only 23. That was the same age I was when we began to have the same trouble with my father to the extent that we needed to help him. He refused the intervention, and there is a chance it couldn't work, but whatever you do, do not cut him off. He needs you more than ever right now. It's tough to have to be a parent to your parent, but after this is all said and done, both of you will be stronger people - and closer than ever, because you might just be the person who is responsible for saving his life. <br>  <br>  I don't think that some of you folks understand. A person who is addicted to drugs can not control their actions. It's not as simple as telling them to "clean up their act." Chemical dependency is a horrible thing to have to deal with. The worst thing for this person to do is to cut off her father from her life. If she does, she will have guilt, remorse, and unending pain from the fact that she could have done something but didn't. Now is not the time for her to "worry about herself." It's a job, no doubt, and someone has to take responsibility for a person who is no longer in the state of mind to take responsibility for themselves. You can not let someone sit back and die (which this path will eventually lead to - in one of many different ways.) Does it suck to have to do this? Yes. Is it an inconvenience to your own life? Yes. Is it the right thing to do? You'd bet your rear end. <br>  <br>  When someone is already dealing with the emotions of a tattered childhood, the last thing they need is for a casualty to happen when there is help available.  An addiction this bad needs to be treated as an emergency, and it's not the time to be selfish. When her father works out his problems (with the professional help he needs,) then they can start on counseling to resolve the hurt and issues from the past that haunt them. Help him to help yourself. It's the only way. <br>  <br>  And like I said, I speak from personal experience and a near exact same situation - except my mother passed away and then my brother almost died from leukemia. That is what drove him to pain pills and addiction...I tried to help but for me, I started too late. Don't let it happen to you.|`|hhL1G3Ofaa	I would talk to him and let him know that once he is truly off the pain pills, that there may be a chance to talk.  Disrespected Grandma and blaming her for things that went wrong in his life is his fault and not hers.  FIRST he needs to grow-up and take responsibility for his own actions and stop putting the blame on everyone else.  Good Luck!!

Thanks. |`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	what you are calling joking she may see as you deliberately trying to hurt her and that's why she gets angry.  some people don't see insults as joking, they see them as insults and personal attacks.<br>  <br>  now that you know you can't kid with your sister in this way, you'll have to figure out another way to relate to her.|`|tQA4eBDlaa	She hates you?|`|szVvf7Nkaa	Take time to talk to her. Let her know that you like to joke with her but that it freaks you out because she gets angry. Ask her if there is anything going on in her life that she would like to talk about. Maybe your sister is going through something right now and maybe she doesn't know how to handle it.|`|AA10796792	I am sure that you already know the answer to that question-Mike<br>  <br>  She gets angry so easily because she has a brother who thinks it is funny to drive her crazy and no one seems to take her seriously enough to stop him<br>  <br>  Do you think maybe her brother could be retarded?|`|zm9LY0fqaa	i think you're wrong.<br>  <br>  she must be retarded.|`|ba31d13528e378072effdd35b73b8031aa	sum ppl take things way too serious....i hate that|`|cXicvrT1aa	Maybe she has Asperger's Syndrome or some other neurological issue that makes her overly sensitive. How do you joke with her? Maybe you should just treat her as if she is retarded and lay off the jokes. I'm sure you can find other ways to relate to your sister. I ignore mine.|`|TQWkPPdaaa	why would you even think that she's mentally challenged? (retarded went out with the dark ages, by the by).  I'm thinking that you think you are joking with her, but you may be sarcastic.  you're hurting her feelings.  I'd get mad at you too.  say something nice or don't say anything at all|`|RlEnPtTbaa	Maybe she hates the way you act. Or maybe you offended her in some way with your jokes.

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	Your lawyer is not competent at all. The very fact this lady married to you & as you say it was a legal marriage (you must be having proof of the same) then the very fact she remarried another person (proof of this marriage should be collected by you) while her first marriage existed this act is bigamy which is a punishable offence. Her second marriage with another man is void marriage & unless she obtain decree of divorce & get her first marriage dissolved she cannot marry legally to the second man.<br>  The lady refuse for obtaining decree of divorce from the court can be managed if you file a criminal complaint against her for bigamy under section 494 of the Indian Penal Code, once she served with notice for this criminal complain from the court,she will not only agree for proper divorce through court rather will be too happy to financially compensate you for the harm she did by her second marriage while her first marriage existed with you.<br>  Your lawyer should by now filled this criminal complaint in the court against her & he is asking her to agree for joint petition for divorce by mutual consent.|`|drzkJ9ouaa	I agree with Mr Vijay m|`|qDGOi5Xqaa	Contact a lawyer and get some legal advice.

N sumtime i can do it. but she can make herself do it just about anytime|`|eseLtD9Haa	yes, I think its so awesome. Lol, and I always burb at the funniest times.

NOAPRIz5aa	The things you specify you do for her are very good, like paying for things, we all like that.  <br>  <br>  What a girl likes just as much though is being romanced, having compliments paid, that kind of thing.  Thoughtful gestures that you don't have to part with money for, like being interested in what she has to say and really listening to her, being sympathetic if she's tired for example.  I'm not saying you don't do those kinds of things, I hope you do, because it shows you care about her as a person and about her feelings/well being.  However, you don't want to be too clingy or possessive because that will scare her off.<br>  <br>  Having reread your first sentence though, it seems like she may well be cooling off towards your relationship, maybe after six months it has run its course for her.  I'm pretty sure that's not what you hoped to hear but it kind of sounds that way, sorry, and if that is the case it will be hard for you because you sound like you really like her. <br>  <br>  Why not ask her straight out and then at least you'll know and you won't be worrying like you seem to be now.|`|bglr4m0Naa	Stop being nice to her, refrain from kind acts until she starts being nice to you in return.|`|9o7KlfvKaa	It seems like she isn't that into you and that other things in her life are more important apparently. I would break up with her and find someone who really appreciates how you go the extra mile.|`|6Rru2901aa	Show her some indifference, no more calling, no more dinner, no more free gas, no more attentions. Try to go out sometimes by yourself meet new people. It's really not worth it if she's going to act like that. I say find yourself a wonderful woman who really appreciates it! *If only I was single =(* lol.<br>  <br>  I went through some of those things with my man and I eventually stopped until he took notice, apologized and I saw some difference...<br>  <br>  Moe|`|eus7WqzUaa	I think your being walked on.  Some women are just gold-diggers.  I am not saying you are loaded but maybe, just maybe, stop doing these things for her and see what happends.  She might just be a free loader.  I am not saying she doesn't care about you.  But it does sound like your giving and she is just taking.|`|AQdOcaxHaa	I know I'm not very experienced for a good answer to a question like this but heres my opinion: I say you should take her out to dinner and talk to her. Maybe she's got something on her mind, or bothering her that she wants to let out but just instead runs away from and tries to forget by going out. Maybe a problem at home or maybe some of her friends are putting alot of pressures on her that she can't handle, and maybe by talking to her about it and giving her the chance to let it all out might help a little bit.|`|NSgYLwwcaa	WELL I'VE HEARD THIS HAPPEN IN MANY RELATIONSHIPS. ME AND MY BOYFRIEND HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOW. WE LIVE TOGETHER, WORK TOGETHER AND GO TO SCHOOL TOGETHER. SO I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AROUND EACH OTHER ALLLLLLLL OF THE TIME. BUT YOU MIGHT JUST HAVE TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE A TALK WITH HER AND TELL HER THAT YOU'RE NOT FEELING APPRECIATED. OR MAYBE YOU'RE IN THE WRONG RELATIONSHIP. I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR, BUT IN SOME CASES-IT'S THE TRUTH. I HOPE I WAS SOME HELP??|`|fETYBigUaa	Mate it seems this relationship has come to a standstill! I admire you for attempting to keep it running!|`|xPfh6bW5aa	Well filling her tank and buying dinner are great things to do for your girl, but have you really showed her how much you love her? If you want her to really appreciate you, you have to go above and beyond all her expectations and show her how much she means to you. Do the most romantic thing you can think of, like a romantic night time stroll under beautiful stars, something every girl dreams of doing with her boyfriend, watch some romantic movies for ideas and brainstorm things you think might really surprise her and blow away.<br>  Basically, show her how much you really love her, let her know she's loved every second.
JMOLRKRraa	I agree. If your other two friends are true friends they will see you without her. I think you are a female, if so, woman usually group in pairs, so the larger group breaks down, and you generally spend time with one other friend at a time. At least in my experience. Easier to talk that way. I hung around with people I never considered a close friend. And others , as far as I am concerned betrayed me. So a true friend is rare. I would not put up with anyone insulting me. I would have punched her in the face by now, so you have alot of restraint.<br>  You will meet new friends at different jobs, different schools, and events, places you will live. And when you get a guy, you will be about him, he might have girl and guy friends. So it might be time to move on. Few friendships last a lifetime.<br>  Learn to enjoy time with yourself, do what you like. Be your own best friend first, because that is the one you will spend the most time with.<br>  Then you will be dependent on no one, and then when a person becomes insulting, you can just leave, screw them.<br>  Think Cartman on South Park , screw you guys, I am going home !|`|WAEDIWz8aa	why do u wanna be friends with her in the first place??<br>  think about it girl.<br>  <br>  dont make the same mistakes i did. <br>  <br>  i had a few friends in my life, and most of them, theyve hurt me so much, and ive realised that there r no real friends any more in this world. very few and difficult to find.<br>  <br>  just let her go. and find a new friend. she is not worth it <br>  <br>  you deserve a better friend. xxx|`|CdTe8MO4aa	i think everyone has at least one "Friend" like that in highschool<br>  <br>  the last time i saw her she was 17 she had her son with some 40 year old and they ran off to get married..|`|8OrOBQXJaa	Tell her shut the **** up.  She is your friend's friend not yours.  You don't have to deal with her, so you can tell her to back off and if your friends are really your friends, they won't give a **** if you like her or not.|`|decWPAHkaa	Yes you're doing the right thing. This young lady isn't your friend and neither are the other two young ladies if they should decide to follow her. You sound like a wise young lady who knows her worth. You have it all figured out. Good luck!|`|LCIcUTwNaa	Yes of course!!!I agree with you drop her and if the other girls are really your friends they will stay friends with you and if not they aren't worth it either.Good Luck to you.|`|kxBrFGohaa	well first of all, you're missing the most important thing to do - talk to her first.  Talk to her about it and be confident; don't mention it as a side comment; make it a real topic that you're concerned about.  Tell her that you're tired of it.  if you don't want to do that, then just be more aloof around her and don't depend on her.  Let her talk to you, while you talk to your other friends.  If you really, really don't like her though, then just continue being friends with the others but not her (give that one friend the cold shoulder)|`|KpgXVhLkaa	Absolutely you are doing the right thing.  It sounds like your "friend" enjoys treating you this way.  And she does it because you a are nice and good person that is too nice and too good to rock the boat by taking up for yourself.  I am happy to hear that you are finally taking up for yourself.  There comes a time when you have to really put yourself first.  I wish you luck.  Remember it may be a little hard at first but it will work out.|`|3H0hluVoaa	Be really good friends with the other 2 girls. Try to ignore her. I dont think it is the best solution but it is a solution that will work.<br>  An alternative would be to talk to her about it.<br>  Hope this helps, I do think it is a good solution, but its up to you to choose what solution you take.|`|RDppZhVYaa	kung fu kick tha foo to tha curb<br>  be stong grasshopper<br>  <br>  cha boi|`|qWdl8ppRaa	kidnap her dog and hold it for ransom money|`|0e4wLPhgaa	i think you should just walk away from this friendship! <br>  <br>  if you have not talked to her, do so first. Sometimes girls act differently with some friends than others because they think that is the way to connect with the other girl. Maybe this person thinks you LIKE her being like that... sit down with her and tell her " 'HER NAME', i dont think we are really connecting lately... so i really want to change that so the four of us can REALLY be BESTIES"<br>  <br>  Also, talk to your other two friends... tell them "i know you are bffs with 'HER NAME' but i feel like she doesnt LIKE me... only you guys.. so could you plz help me?"<br>  <br>  If none of this works then just ignore her... if she askes you a direct question say YES, NO, MAYBE... and so on!|`|6TVAut8naa	Sometimes, people who hurt us, they only make us stronger in time.<br>  We should in many way be grateful for this peoples challenges.<br>  <br>  Try and just turn the other cheek.<br>  And you will see that you will keep all your three friends, and even feel<br>  as if you have actually gotten a new friend, in your enemy.<br>  <br>  You will feel that you, yourself are growing. You will see things more clearly.<br>  And maybe even see Thru here some day.<br>  But you should maybe write your thought`s in a diary.<br>  Cause a lot of feelings might go thru you.<br>  <br>  If she want`s you to be here slave, then just be here slave, and obied here every wink.<br>  Eventually she will realize that she is the one that is evil. And might try and change here ways.<br>  You, you will be not responding to the hate towards you.<br>  And that might even make you even more attractive for other friends.<br>  <br>  Cause you`ll be a person who does not make trouble, Growing and maturing insideyourselff.|`|DozD8lTGaa	Friend? She's far from a 'Friend'!<br>  <br>  <br>  Well, talk to your real friends about it... Especially the two she is trying to take away from you. If your friends are really true friends they will help you through it and stick by you.<br>  <br>  This girl sounds like a bratty two year old!! She is clearly jealous of your friendship you with have with the other two. Why don't you confront her in front of your other two friends??<br>  <br>  Stick up for yourself and tell her about herself... Then she will soon stop.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If your other friends don't take notice; it's best to move on. After all, you want people who will be there for you when you need them... <br>  <br>  <br>  If you need to talk, message me and I will try and help you some more.<br>  Good luck and i hope you get it sorted.<br>  I hope i helped :) x|`|0UHArYDbaa	Absolutely the right thing, if the other two are really your friends then they will not abandon you. As for why she is really mean to you, it's most probably because she feels threatened by you in some way, or jealous. Of course she could just be a class A *****, but usually even in that case, the bitches have issues of some sort.|`|8a4a9fe52b388ded89193b4bb5f60138aa	i know this from experience if someone is treating you unfairly then their not your friends best thing to do is forget her shes not worth the pain that she is causing and the other two if they are your real friends then they will still want to be with you and hang out with you and stuff.<br>  <br>  you'll do the right things. forget her and move on its the best thing to do.<br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  <br>   good luck|`|wYXpx5uiaa	yeah your doing the right and shes not a friend if she treats you like that a friend will always be there and always be loyal to you they would never try to cause pan and would be the ones with you while your cryin so yeah forget and dont regret it.<br>  and if they are your true friends than they will make the decision to stay by your side<br>  i hope i helped cya|`|FpktEfe8aa	dude dude dude if the girls doing this then she really isnt a friend so start off by not calling her ur friend <br>  think of her as no one ignore her<br>  in a way be hard to get only talk with her if she talks to you<br>  show her that its not getting to you <br>  because all she really wants is to get a rise out of u and thats exactly what u r giving her<br>  let her know that u couldnt care less :)|`|3azXcbZ4aa	YES!I have heard this b4.

Ask her if she could be resppective towards you even if she doesn't like you(same with you) <br>  <br>  With the other two girls, explain to them what the probelm is and consider talking it over with them and see how they feel about it too! even if you dont stay friends with the one your angry with try and stay really close with the other two! if they are really your friends then they will understand how you are feeling and talk to the other one. if that doesn't work then their NOT real friends.  There's more fish in the sea!<br>  GOOD LUCK!! i hope this helped|`|beFbSDnkaa	I absolutely would first tell her that you are offended by her behavior towards you. My question is, how old is this girl? Are you in high school? Secondly, if the other two girls are truly your friends then they will not reject you. If they do then they weren't really your friends in the first place. Take it from old wisdom..."if you love someone, set them free, and if they come back, then you will know that they loved you too."  Also, from God's Word, The Bible, you are to go to someone immediately and tell them if they have offended you. Then there are no false pretenses, and you can be real with that person. The truth will always set you free.|`|zs9tHeAWaa	This is really easy! I thought about this when I watched the bachelor the other day. If you have anyone that is in your life who makes you fell inferior, or low, or less than. THEY ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS, AND SHE DOES NOT RESPECT YOU OR THINK YOU ARE WORTHY OF RESPECT. Because... She is just a stupid Bi*ch. I know because I had a friend I really liked alot, but she never respected me because she always thought she was smarter than me, and prettier them me. You can compromise to be her friend if the relationship is worth it to you, or beneficial to you in some way( like she makes your parents want to give you money). Other wise, STOP WORRING ABOUT THE BI*CH AND JUST IGNORE HER. If your other friend are true, they will like you no matter what. If they don't, get other friends, there are billions of people on this world.
AA10702820	Well they should be able to go through some sort of files that show that you are very well apart of the family. If I were you I'd call your cousin and his wife or whoever lives over there that hasn't said you weren't apart of the family and explain what has happened. They should able to tell the hospital what has happened and clear things up so that the nurse won't say you have to get info from the family.<br>  That or just wait until they put her in the mental instituation. I don't think they would keep her there if she really isn't have mental problems. Is there anyway that you can somehow go down there yourself? If not then just keep trying, see if there's a way you can clear stuff up at the hospital and get her to your house. I'm sure that there will be a way for her to move in with you.
