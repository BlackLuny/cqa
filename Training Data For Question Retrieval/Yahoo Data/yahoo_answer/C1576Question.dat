20090205174956AA4RSd6	Travel;Asia Pacific;Thailand	Is this true ? There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding visa runs?	New Visa Rules for Thailand    By thaizer ? December 29, 2008       In the first week of December 2008, new visa rules came into force in Thailand. The new ruling mainly affects visitors entering Thailand at a land border checkpoint without a visa. Visitors arriving at any of Thailand’s international airports should not be affected by the new rules.       Arriving in Thailand by Land or Sea Crossing   The old ruling used to be that most visitors entering Thailand without a visa would be granted a 30-day ‘permission to stay’ stamp also known as the visa exemption rule (some travellers mistakenly call this a visa on arrival). Under the new regulations, those arriving in Thailand via a land or sea crossing without a visa will now only be granted a 15-day permission to stay/visa exemption instead of 30 days. Under the old system there were limits to the number of back-to-back stamps you could gain in this way. Under the new rules that limit has gone and in theory travellers can continually enter and re-enter Thailand at a land border crossing every 15 days if they so desire without the need to apply in advance for a visa.

20090205165731AAA61Tt	Travel;United Kingdom;Other - United Kingdom	What are some less ethnically diverse towns and cities in the south-east of england?	I'm looking to move from where currently live (Wood Green in Haringey, London), to a nicer place. The thing I don't like about Wood Green is that there are very few English people living here.       But even within Wood Green, one of the most diverse places in the UK, I live in a place that's even more so. I have thought about why this is and have come up with a few probable reasons:      The first is that I live close (within 5 mins walk) from 2 tube stations. The second is that my spot is well known as being Greek area/community. The third is that I live just off a high road, with foreign grocers and businesses. Most of my neighbours are either Greek or Polish and eastern European workers.      Basically, I've had it living here. I strongly believe that my social life has taken a knock because of this as there are simply no people 'like me' - English in their early 20's. I want to move!      I would like to know of towns in the south-east of England, places like Kent, Surrey, Essex, Sussex etc., where there is a white British population of 95%+ and not below this. I know that even moving to another London borough or somewhere not so close to a commercial high road would probably bring enough 'normality' and possiblities of friendship with English people, but screw that. I want to experience life in the complete polar opposite of where I've grown up the first 20 years of my life (and for the most part, disliked). So 95% British is my criteria. And preferably quite a large town or city.       I've actually briefly stayed in St. Albans where I believe the English population is something like 85-90%. However even this isn't enough for me as the ethnic population is still quite clear and present, and it reminds me too much of Woody (and I've grown sick of the place, like eating too many sweets!). No, I want no less than 95% Brit.      Stick to answering my question please people! Unless you've lived in a place like N22, just off Green Lanes, then you're in no position to judge!
