I have already used that "thing" and it worked for my earphones with jacks that does not fit my cellphone's slot. I'm just not so sure if those earphones that worked with my "thing" is exactly 3.5mm. Currently, im on a mall and i was about to buy a headset which has a 0.32 cm jack. Before i decide to buy it and be sorry when i find out that it would not fit the "thing" that i left at home, i decided to first ask kind people out there if a 0.32 cm jack (3.2mm) would fit my "thing" with a 3.5mm slot?

I have a reason to believe its the disc drive but can it be another internal issue? Anyone have the same problem and found the solution?

20090131094448AAjePsG	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	PS3 Component video problem.?	I have a problem hooking up my PS3 to my TV. My TV doesn't support HDMI, so I'm using component video and optical audio (hooking up to my audio system box thingy). The audio is fine, but I'm getting a weird problem with the video.      If I hook up the YPbPr wires to the back of the TV with nothing else plugged into it, it works perfectly. However, if I plug the cable box (also using component video) into the second set of YPbPr ports on the TV, the PS3 video starts flickering and receives, what looks like interference. I even unplugged the power to the cable box, but as long as the component wires are both hooked up, the PS3 still screws up.      However, I disconncted the YPbPr wires from the back of the cable box and left them plugged into the TV and the problem is fixed; it seems this only happens when the cable box wires are hooked up to the TV and the cable box at the same time. I tried hooking up an Xbox 360 YPbPr wires into where the cable box wires go on the TV and the PS3 is fine.      So in a nutshell, the PS3 video doesn't work if the cable box component video cables are hooked into the TV and the cable box itself. Do you know what could cause this?

20090131095415AADCuZa	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	My friend's having a problem with his PS3 and he doesn't know if it's under Warranty or not. Here's the prob..?	He bought the PS3, 40GB, a few onths after this past Christmas from Wal*Mart in Crawfordville and he doesn't know if it has the warranty or not (??) but, the problem is when you first turn the PS3 on, it doesn't go to the regular start-up screen with the little tune and your settings come up like a big PSP, it doesn't do that anymore, it goes straight to the sign-in online and the system settings, etc. And the screen is yellow and when you try to put a game in, it's not loading. You'll see the tiny circle at the top of the screen like it's trying but it doesnt go any further. What do you guys think? Or could you give us the Sony Customer Care Help line number for US/North America?

My brother has the ipod touch and he loves it! The only thing I dont like about it is how big it is. I dont carry around a purse so when i go places I usually put everything in my jacket pocket. I really like how you can go on youtube, and access the internet, but the reason i was thinking about getting the 8gb nano was because I really dont have too many songs that I would put on the ipod, maybe about 200-300 songs! I dont want to get an ipod touch and have it be wasted because it wouldn't have that many songs on it. Im just not sure what to do. If any one could give me the pros and cons of the ipod nano and the ipod touch i would really appreciate it!. Thanks (:

I may have to buy a short aerial cable to connect the analogue aerial input to the digital aerial output. The DVD recorder is connected to the TV with a Scart cable, and the recorder will give us digital and Freeview. From the instructions, it looks as if I need an audio/video cord in order to get sound. This cord would connect from the front of the TV to the DVD recorder, and it has white, yellow and red jacks. However, my old video recorder which was a Sony didn't require an audio/video cord to get sound. It was connected to the TV with a Scart cable. Will it be necessary to buy an audio/video cord in order to get sound on my new DVD recorder?

20090131130251AAIlEea	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Who else is psyched for The Conduit (Wii)?	It's a fps wii exclusive coming out this summer. It also has great graphics (for the wii at least), completely customizable controls, online multi w/ 16 players, and will be compatible with wii motion plus and wii speak! I know xbox 360 and ps3 fanboys will rail against the graphics but I personally find the wiimote to be much more suited to fps and a better trade off. Plus I'm in college and poor.      Everybody who owns a wii NEEDS to get this game. It's not a secret that videogame developers still think of the wii as a kid console and refuse to put out any quality games. Instead we get crappy minigames.      The 3rd party developers (HVS) risked a lot by spending so much time and money on this game and a lot of other 3rd parties are looking to see how it pans out. If it does in fact fail, then we'll just be proving them right and they'll keep on churning out crapware. So if you're one of those wii owners who are looking for more mature, quality games PLEASE GET THIS GAME!

20090225092117AAzfcNj	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Help! Which AT&T phone do I go for?	So here's my story: I was really stoked about the AT&T Quickfire. But just recently, it was pulled from shelves and now I have no idea what to do. I used to own a Cingular 8125 and so once I had a QWERTY phone, I was hooked. My contract has expired, and so I'm now looking for something. I would just wait and see what the "new" Quickfire will be, but who knows how long it will take for that to happen.      So, some of the phones I had considered alongside the Quickfire were:      - Pantech Matrix   - Blackberry Curve   - Palm Centro   - Pantech Matrix Pro   - Pantech Duo      Or anything else anyone can suggest. I'm mainly looking for:   - A solid QWERTY keypad.   - Fast, reliable internet (and IM).   - User-friendly with a good amount of features.   - Able to add new programs/games/etc.      I'm really all about something that I won't get bored of (mostly why I enjoyed the 8125, even though I had to replace it twice...) ALSO! I am not looking to spend more than 200 dollars (after rebates), so this is why I did not list the Blackberry Bold or HTC Fuze.      Sorry for such a long post! But thank you in advance. Any help is greatly appreciated. :)

20090131141658AAMHRhN	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Changing phones with an att ?	ok so I'm getting the Sony Ericsson w760 but I already have a 2 year contract with AT&T. I know to switch phones while already having,  contract you must pay full price for the phone,but I wanted to know if there are any other fees I must pay. I heard that if you just buy the phone unbranded from a store unaffiliated with AT&T then you only pay for the phone and that's it, but otherwise there are a bunch of fees you get hit with. Is that true? And if so, do you know of any good sites that sell unbranded phones for really good deals? I found the sony I want for 218 plus shipping, handling, and taxes (251 all together) at cti-miami.com, but would like a better deal. I'm in the US btw, South Florida.

I had it plugged in to my iHome all night, and now after listening to it for probably about 2 1/2 hours total (maybe a bit longer), not watching any video or playing games or anything, it's more than halfway down. Is this normal? I'm okay with replacing the battery if needed, so if you can refer me to a good place to get a new one that would be great.      Also, the back panel of my iPod is really scratched up, is there a way of getting it replaced as well? I just want to consider this if it's a reasonable idea.

20090131140836AAunFR8	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Are my Wiimotes dead?	Yeah... so I have a problem with my wiimotes and I'm beginning to think they simply died. I bought my Wii 9 months ago, along with 2 wiimotes. They both worked fine and I played alot, but I lost interest and the Wii eventually sat in the corner of my basement collecting dust for a few months.       Today, I decided to give it another go and turned it on, finding that both of my wiimotes produced no response whatsoever. I tried replacing batteries, re-syncing, but not a single blue flash or any other response came out of it. Am I forgetting to do something, or are my wiimotes dead? I remember before that the wiimotes flashed blue squares depending on how much battery was remaining, but neither do that now.
