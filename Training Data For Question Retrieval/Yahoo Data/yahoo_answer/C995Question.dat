20081216091125AA1S8Lz	Sports;Basketball	Who's your favorite NBA player of all time?	It can be any time frame, current or past. I'm going to go with Dr.J, Hakeem Olajuwon, Michael Jordan, and Magic Johnson. In that order. Overall though, Dr. J, why? Dr. J was the reason why I started to like basketball in the first place and I seen Dr. J during the 1970's play so you know how excited a NBA/ABA fan had to be to see someone like him perform! Dr. J had some mad hops too! Touching the top of the NBA backboard! LOL Plus, he could average 10 boards a game with ease and his outside shooting touch was overlooked by his high flying dunks which were more exciting. Dr. J Fan for life baby! Peep his Dr. Pepper commercial! LOL

20090219224021AAkTva2	Sports;Wrestling	What the WWE should do....?	A lot of people lately have been saying that the WWE has been improving. I don't see how, we are once again seeing another Orton/HHH storyline that is going to turn into a match headlining Wrestlemania 25, and I gurantee the match will be good because it is Wrestlemania, they will give to the fans since its there 'Super Bowl'. Than after Wrestlemania..... we are guranteed the same match at Backlash.... and guess what that match will suck. John Cena vs Edge is the same thing, and Cena is not as bad of a wrestler as he seems, he is bad, but he is shoved down our throats.      What the WWE should do is since they made these matches for Wrestlemania is the next night on Raw they should hold a battle royal winner getting a WWE title shot after Backlash or whenever the fued ends, have a youngster like CM Punk win. They need to push there younger stars.      This really gets to me, everyone says they are pushing them, but there pushing them incorrectly and that is what you fail to see.      CM Punk- former WHC...... How did he win his World Title.... he won it because Batista gave Edge a Batista Bomb, that is shitting all over CM Punk. He should have had a storyline with Edge, and the match would be great because there both young and good in the ring. No one wants to see Botchtists vs Edge, Batista sucks..he is slow, and clumsy.      Shelton Benjiman- He is US Champ, when was the last time he defended it? He beat Triple H 5 straight times back in 2004, that could have made a storyline with the two, putting him in the WHC storyline, perfect chance there.      The list goes on and on, if you do not agree with me, tell me where you think I am wrong.

It was the 1999 and 2000 Laguna 2 models that look really similar to mine.  On the face of mine there is no Laguna 2 with a crown above it, and next to the Titleist on the back there is a red dot that go a little bit into the putter.  If anyone knows if it's a counterfeit that would be great.      Thanks

20090219233954AALEzQn	Sports;Basketball	Who were disappointed at the NBA trade deadline?	I know I was because my Nets didn't make a move that would at least make the team exciting to watch. I didn't expect them to make a major move for an All-Star or anything because I know that they are rebuilding. I was just hoping that they could at least add a player who could help to make the team alittle more exciting than they are now. However, it looked like the Nets front office had other plans and didn't make a move. So I am here to say that I'm greatly disappointed and now I have to watch my Nets continue to look like a laughingstock team AND continue to watch their so-called head coach Lawrence Frank continue to make a fool out of himself. Who else was disappointed at their team at the trade deadline?

20070707214155AAt4y4m	Sports;Wrestling	Rey's return?	DALLAS – Our fans who watched SmackDown this past Friday night got a great piece of news: the exciting, high-flying Rey Mysterio will soon be returning to action. Rey, a former World Champion who has been a crowd favorite throughout his whole career, has been out of action for almost nine months, but will be back in the SmackDown ring later this summer.      While our fans will be glad to see Mysterio back in action, not everyone in the SmackDown locker room is ready to welcome the Superstar from the 619 back into the fold. And that sentiment, like many other things on SmackDown, starts right at the top.      “SmackDown is not Rated-R for Rey,” World Heavyweight Champion Edge would like to remind everyone. “I don’t lose sleep over anyone; they should lose sleep over me. I give everyone the best match on the card and best match of their career. Everyone wants to fight me and that’s for a reason.”        A few Superstars, including new SmackDown draftee Chris Masters, are looking forward to Rey’s return, if only for selfish reasons.        “Rey’s return means that I can show everyone what “The Masterpiece” is capable of,” Masters gloated. “Rey has accomplished so much in his illustrious career in WCW, ECW and WWE. However, he just can’t contend with “The Masterpiece;” it’s just a matter of genetics and physical size.”       Mark Henry, who met Mysterio multiple times during Rey’s reign as World Champion in 2006, echoed those thoughts.       “Rey’s return is a good thing. It gives me something more to do, another body to mangle and beat up,” he boasted. “Rey Mysterio and I have crossed paths many a nights and he came out on the short end of the stick - no pun intended.”      Masters piggybacked that thought, saying “He can do a lot of cool stuff; he’s a very athletic dude and I won’t take credit away from him…but he’s just genetically out-matched when it comes to facing me.”      Being the underdog in a land of giants won’t be anything new to Mysterio, who has battled men larger than himself his whole career. Brett & Brian Major, SmackDown’s newest tag team, respect Mysterio because of his fighting spirit and can’t wait until he’s there in the flesh.      “In an underdog world, Rey’s the major dog. He was a Cruiserweight Champion, a World Heavyweight Champion…he’s an inspiration to us,” said Brett Major. “We’re not the biggest guys in the world but hopefully we can achieve our goals to become the WWE Tag Team Champions.”      Added brother Brian, “We look up to Rey. He’s one of the most exciting wrestlers in this business. Once he’s back, we’d like to pick his brain a little bit to see how he did things.”      There’s no doubt that when he returns, Mysterio will look to regain the World Championship, which is fine with the current champion.      “If Rey Mysterio decides upon his return to try to go after the World Heavyweight Championship, he’s in for a surprise,” Edge bellowed. “He’ll have the match of his life, but he’ll end up on his shoulders at the end of it.”      All things considered, however, The Rated-R Superstar knows what Rey can do. They’ve met in the ring before, and they were WWE Tag Team Champions together five years ago, so Edge had to give Mysterio his due.      “I’m not discrediting Rey Mysterio, he’s one of the best ever,” he admitted. “As a matter of fact, I’m salivating because I can’t wait to get into the ring with him and further prove why I AM the World Heavyweight Champion.”      Soon enough, he’ll have his chance, because the return of the masked sensation from the 619 is imminent. No one, perhaps even Mysterio himself, knows exactly when Rey will re-emerge; but when he does, our fans are sure to be in store for tons of excitement.

Is it ok, weekly mileage wise, to go from 36mi one week, down to 25, up to 30, then up to 40 (where I will level off for the rest of the summer)?      I really want to do well in cross country this fall... my summer goal is 300 miles, by August 18. I think that is totally doable at this point, only issue is that I am going on vacation for 10 days... so far I have 88 miles this summer (since early June), with 36 miles last week.   I leave tomorrow for vacation, til July 16 (10 days). So the first week I will do about 25mi, the week I get back probably 30. And the week after that I will be home the whole week so about 40 (which I would be at next week if not for going away).       Is this ok, or will jumping around mileage like this mess with my body too much?

There were 2 OT games. The options were all set to default, and skill level maxed out on each game. I let the AI control the games I just let it run. Every time I did this so far the games have been right, What are your thoughts?
