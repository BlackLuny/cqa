Those restaurants are NOT funky and fun places. They're just normal places. Try Cha Cha Chas! The 2 locations are equally great. Try the sangria! Great mojios! But watch out, it goes down easier then you realize ;) the jerk chick and ceviche is to DIE for! The average age group is 25-45. It's loud and exciting, so it's easy to have conversations and tell great jokes and have a few drinks!    I absolutely promise you'll love it. http://www.cha3.com/    For a great lunch/breakfast place that is more low key but great environment would be Squat and Gobble. Awesome crepes. Yummy eggs. My favorite is the greek crepe with a coffee and a mimosa.  http://www.squatandgobble.com/    I have heard from others that this place called House of Prime Rib is the best for, well... prime rib.

NfSLXHU3aa	I could find no reference of a Cavern (Beatles) club in Los Angeles, just Liverpool.    There's a Cavern Club Theater, but it's not a Beatles Club.  It's located in the basement of a Mexican restaurant, the Casita Del Campo.  Currently they have a Cabaret playing.    I also found a web site that has Beatles Tribute Bands that play in Southern CA that you can hire.|`|8VZeJ2KZaa	I don't remember one specifically called The Cavern Club, unless it was in the 60's or early 70's (I doubt it would have been open during that time period).

8bc2fa1097ef6fdd70520d78d2dca2d7aa	okay....you want to take your date and have an awesome time...right?!?  Try Antoine's on St. Louis.. This place has been in business since 1840 and owned by the same family. It can be pricey but well worth it. I mean this is your date we're talkin about. For desert, get the Baked Alaska. You have to order it at the beginning of the meal so it can be ready when your ready. It's AWESOME!!! If your looking for a nice place, Antoine's is it. It's really part of New Orleans history. They have a website so go look. Plan ahead..you will need to make reservations. Jazz clubs....try Snug Harbor over in Faubourg/Marigny on Frenchmen St. This is right outside of the quarter. Revervations will probably be needed here too. People like, Ellis Marsalis, Charmaine Neville usually play there. There are some other jazz clubs there too so if Snug is full, catch one of the other places. It would be a short cab ride from the quarter. If you want another place to go, try Tropical Isle. It's on Bourbon. From 5 to 9 you can catch Waylon Thibodeaux and the Bourbon St. Cajuns. They play Zydeco(french cajun music). These guys rock! They're a lot of fun. Then from 9 to 12 you can hear Willie "Hambone" Locket and The All Purpose Blues Band. These guys are really good too. After the first set, they can be a bit repetitive. So, catch the first set and try another place. All of these places I mentioned have websites so go have a look. I hope this helps. Hope you guys have a great time!|`|791d4f9e4f79c13e41e826352dcb9b61aa	Traveler covered them I agree with his choices|`|Cf74N7t2aa	Some that are more upscale and more well known I would recommend are    Emeril's Restaurant   (504) 528-9393   800 Tchoupitoulas St  New Orleans, LA  http://www.emerils.com/restaurants/newor...

Few restaurants survive a decade, let alone 10 of them, so you know there has to be *something* special about the place. And our single experience, this past Sunday afternoon, says this is still true. The atmosphere accounts for a great deal of this -- "Intimate" is a good description, and this is aided by old wood paneling, small tables with white table clothes, and vintage pictures of both San Francisco and 100 years of celebrities covering the walls. The wait staff, wearing white shirts and black ties, are attentive, though their training may be spotty. Our waiter seemed disappointed that we weren't ordering appetizers and expensive drinks, but at the end of the meal, after we decided not to order a dessert (we were stuffed -- it was the middle of the afternoon and not a regular meal time), he brought us a complimentary flan to share, which was delicious. We all ordered seafood, and it was quite good. The calamari was cooked correctly -- It was soft and not rubbery, and my family, normally talkative, was noticeably quiet while eating. My husband and older son ordered Fruits de Mer Pasta (linguine, mussels, scallops, calamari, sauce), while my younger son ordered lobster ravioli. Everyone was pleased with their food.|`|Wq5Fwv5Haa	JJ's Steakhouse in Pasadena, CA  88 W.

AA10804824	The restaurant I am at now has 48 tables, my last job has 19. Both privately owned, with about the same pricing.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	call around|`|db06833cd32d477373d0a2c38a077b60aa	I would venture that the number of tables is inversely proportional to the average entree price, and limited by available space, table size and chair size.    If you call ten cheap feed troughs, the number will be higher: if you call ten snooty restaurants, the number will be lower.    From what I know, it is not the amount of tables in a restaurant, but the number of "turns" a table has.  For example: if you have a huge restaurant with 100 tables, but only get 10 tables/hour of business then you have a lot of unused space.  On the other hand, if you have 10 tables, and 10 tables/hour of business, then you are efficiently using your space.    Like, in our neighborhood, PF Changs has about 75 tables.  They are always packed and have a wait.  Abuleos, 100 feet away, has 75 tables and no one eats there.  Clearly, PF Changs has a better use of there tables.    The rate is more important than the size.
