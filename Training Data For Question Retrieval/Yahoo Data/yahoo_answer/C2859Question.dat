20090128123122AANkCv5	Dining Out;United States;Other - US Dining Out	Does Pizza Hut think it's fooling anyone?	Seriously, none of their commercials are even half-way believable.  No one who goes to a fancy Italian restaurant will think that their terrible "Macaroni and Bacon" pasta was really on the menu.  And "Macaroni and Bacon"?! They're just making **** up.  I've never heard of that in my life, and I've certainly never seen it even in an Olive Garden-grade Italian restaurant.   And then they have the commercials with the "natural" pizza.  What. The. Hell. Were the pizzas they were selling before this unnatural?  Were they made of some synthetic paste spread over silicon disks? NO! Dough and cheese are freaking natural, assholes.   And now they have a commercial where they think that we will really believe that they fooled real Italians into thinking that their awful pasta is real Italian food.   It's just the most absolutely retarded advertising campaign ever.     Do they really think they are fooling anyone?

I used to order this sandwich all the time and stopped for about 3 months or so and the other day I ordered just a half of one and it tasted totally different. Definitely wasn't as delicious as I remembered. I'm sad because this was my favorite sandwich and now it doesn't even taste the same! Did anybody else notice a different or do you know if they changed the recipe or something? Thanks!
