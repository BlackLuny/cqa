sSq22G8Taa	You may want to check and try a few things to begin with in this case.  First off, I would always recommend doing the basic steps before trying to Sync again.<br>  <br>  1) Restart Computer<br>  2) Reset iPod (hold down Menu and center Select button down together for 10 seconds until you see an Apple logo)<br>  <br>  Then if those don't work after you try to sync you'll go onto the next troubleshooting step<br>  <br>  1) Uninstall iTunes<br>  - Actually consists of uninstalling (Apple Mobile Device Support, Apple Software Updates, Quicktime, and iTunes)<br>  <br>  This step usually resolves many issues with Syncing.  Also try basic things like using a new USB port (or a different one your not use to using).

Why not just buy an iPod Touch? If you get the phone you have to sign a two year contract, which can add up to be pretty expensive if you're only using the iPod function.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to just get the iPod Touch, it'll be much cheaper in the long run. Plus the iPhone only comes in two sizes 8GB and a16GB  model. The original iPhones were only available in 4GB and 8GB models.Now the iPod Touch has THREE models an 8GB, then a 16GB as well as a 32GB model.|`|Ti9tKWigaa	Are you F@#$ing retarded?<br>  <br>  If you get an iPhone, you are stuck in a 2-year contract and have to pay $80+ a MONTH. <br>  <br>  If you want an iTouch, get an iTouch, NOT an iPhone.

I think everyone gives you a few days to buy the plan after your purchase so check about that, if so then use those days as a trial and see if you think its going to be prone to falls and scratches.

pZGLhV2Waa	Any of the Nikon DSLR's would be good. As your first SLR there is really no need to go with the D200 or even the D90. The fact of the matter is you don't no how to use them and therefore the extra features would be useless. If I were you I would look at the D40 or the D60. They are both very capable cameras and are good to learn on. Rather than put your money into a camera body that will be obsolete in a few years you should put it into lenses. Lenses are what will determine the quality of your photos not the camera. There will be virtually no difference in image quality from the D40 to the D200 until you get into high ISO shots and even then it wont be much. Good lenses on the other hand will last for decades. Large aperture lenses really can't be beat and they are expensive. There are different lenses for every subject. Below is a list of some good common lenses and their uses. You will soon find out that good lenses will cost as much or more than the camera itself. It is better over all to build your lens collection and then in a few years upgrade your camera body.<br>  <br>  Landscapes and architecture: Wide angle the Nikkor 12-24mm <br>  <br>  Portraits: Nikkor 50mm F1.8 or F1.4 on up to about 85mm. Prime or fixed focal length lenses are best for this as they have a large aperture and are generally sharper than zooms.<br>  <br>  Sports: Zoom lenses like the 55-200mm or the 70-300mm or the 70-200mm F2.8 are good. <br>  <br>  Close up: The Nikkor 105mm F2.8 micro is great for extreme closeups of flowers, bugs and other small objects. It is also a good lens for portraits though it is a little long.<br>  <br>  General Photography: There are many lenses for this. The 18-55mm kit lens is not a bad lens. The focal length will be fine for most of your pictures. There are other better choices in the same range but that lens will get you started nicely.<br>  <br>  If you want a lens that will do just about everything the Nikkor 18-200mm is a great choice. For many people it is the only lens they will ever need.<br>  <br>  You should also take a class. There is no sense in spending this much money on a fancy point and shoot camera. Learning how to use the camera properly will greatly increase the quality of your photographs and your enjoyment.|`|d55HYaktaa	The Nikon D90 is as good as the D200. Just different features.<br>  <br>  The Nikon D90 is a newer generation, so it results in better image quality. It has a software-based correction for chromatic aberration and distortion. It's a advanced amateur camera.<br>  <br>  The D200 has a faster autofocus, better mettering system, weather sealing and better body structure. It's a semi-pro camera.<br>  <br>  You may get the D90 with the 18-200mm VR lens. It will cover almost all the focal length you need.|`|pDcJGptPaa	Get the Nikon D60 kit. It comes with the 18-55mm lens and the 55-200mm lens. It also gives you the bag and all the accessories you could possibly need to get started. All for about $650 if you shop around. Hard to beat and you will be shooting images that will stun your friends and family. An entry level DSLR with point and shoot simplicity.|`|hLkpuG9Xaa	Whoa hold on there :P<br>  <br>  Jumping into DSLR with such expensive camera choices is risky, and could end up being a waste of money. <br>  <br>  Any sensible person would tell you to slow down, and to get a less expensive camera. The reason being is that it isn't always the camera that makes the best photos, its the lens. Instead of getting a really expensive camera and a sub-par lens, you can get a moderately expensive camera and a relatively good lens. <br>  <br>  That being said, i will still properly answer your question. On the D90 VS D200 discussion, i have a link to a question i just answered about 10 minutes ago. Sorry lol, i dont really feel like rewriting the answer. Here is the link: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnAiojoE7cc1qeBap9gMeN7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309184454AAGQfMG&show=7#profile-info-QGm1pFrxaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  Generally, everybody's happy getting a D90. On Amazon, the price of the D90 BODY ONLY is 900$. You can also get the bundled one, that comes with an 18-105mm lens, which costs 1179.99$. <br>  <br>  The 18-105 lens is a great all around lens, capable of taking wide angle shots, to relatively close ones. <br>  <br>  Instead of getting the bundle, however, you can get the body only plus a really good all around lens, with even more coverage than the 18-105. I'm talking about the 18-200, which got a spot as a top 10 lens from this pro <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/10-best.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/10-best...</a><br>  <br>  This lens costs 700$ dollars on amazon, however. Thatll make to a total of 1600. Kinda expensive. And risky. If you eventually decide that taking this path on photography was a bad idea, what are you gonna do? Sell it? Not for nearly as much as you bought it, that's for sure. <br>  <br>  My recommendation would be to either go to your local store, get the D90 with the 18-105, and first try it out. Don't make any decision for certain. Ask how long the return period is. <br>  <br>  Also, my other recommendation would be to try out some other lower end cameras, instead of jumping in to the more professional ones.<br>  <br>  What's a toddler gonna do with a bicycle if he doesn't know how to ride it yet?<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck to you!
p6BXHhxnaa	Most people will tell you to "start out with the D40 / D40X / D60."  I started out with the D60, and was a bit unsatisfied when I learned that my camera didn't have a focusing motor.<br>  <br>  If you have money to justify it, more power to you.  Go for the D90.  Chances are, unless you're really going to get into photography, you'll buy only one dSLR, so you may as well make it a great one.  Don't end up like me, wishing you'd have bought a different camera, or simply pining for another.  <br>  <br>  I can personally tell you that Nikon makes a great dSLR.  As far as lenses go, the kit lens which is usually sold with the D90 (18-105mm) should suffice.  In fact, that lens has great versatility.  With that range, you shouldn't need another lens unless you want to get serious with photography.  But should you wish for some more glass, try something along the lines of a 70-300mm telephoto, and you're covered in a very large number of focal lengths.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun.|`|AA12114566	The Nikon D40 is a good camera if you want to buy your first SLR|`|8EmeNHyjaa	Nikon D90 is a great choice<br>  12.3 megapixel CMOS sensor <br>  Low noise ISO sensitivity from 200 to 3200<br>  3-inch super-density 920,000-dot color LCD monitor<br>  11-point AF system with Face Priority<br>  and 18-105 VR lens kit work great,images are pretty sharp and clear<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ENOZY4?ie=UTF8&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001ENOZY4" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ENO...</a>|`|rxepaX6Iaa	Nikon D90 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S VR DX Nikkor Zoom Lens is ok<br>  <br>  review more detail at..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ENOZY4?ie=UTF8&tag=yahanswer-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001ENOZY4" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ENO...</a>

You need to refer to page 86 in your manual regarding "File No. Sequence". The default condition, "off", is what you're experiencing.

As you learn to use the camera and become comfortable with it, scanning through the manual will alert you to things that might be interesting to try.<br>  <br>  Also, read Ken Rockwell's users guide on the D40.

If you have Photoshop that's newer than version 7, Photoshop has a wonderful RAW editor which is superb.

Maybe they wanted people with low end PC's to be able to play it also.

jj0C3nWkaa	Hey Tre,  I've worked for T-Mobile for 4+ years I can help you! <br>  if you want VERIZON I know where you can get truck load of verizon phones for free and you don't even have to do a rebate they're just free! They make us learn the offers from other companies like verizon so we can be competitive when customers call in, so I know what the best deals are right now. I have customers tell me too they can get phones cheaper on this website all the time and I get sick of it but it's true, there's a whole grip of em in there for free.<br>  <br>  if you go to <a href="http://mytalkcell.info" rel="nofollow">http://mytalkcell.info</a> and click on "cell phones" at the very top and then when that page loads there's a little drop down box and you select verizon and you see all the verizon deals. Then you click where is says price today at the top of the list and all the free ones come to the top that are free and you don't even need to send in a rebate they are just free if you sign up for the new verizon contract.<br>  There's even a blackberry in there for free!!! that's an amazing deal those Blackberries retail for like $400, see what i mean about this website. . .  i wish it would quit stealing my sales at work. . .  anyway it doesn't matter when im not at work. <br>  <br>  if the blackberry is to crazy of a phone there's a bunch of deals on smaller phones, what I would suggest is use the other drop down box and the top that says features and select Mp3 and look at those phones those are usually the best ones and if it has an Mp3 player it almost always has a camera that's the kinda phone I would get, I would do that and see what you like. <a href="http://mytalkcell.info" rel="nofollow">http://mytalkcell.info</a> I hope this helps you out Tre, snag a good one.|`|4AfRTzRmaa	the envy 2<br>  chocolate 2<br>  voyager|`|cRdeb0T1aa	the GZone.

z88IMXNFaa	You can only get the iPhone at the $200/$300 price with a two year AT&T contract.  The contract requires the data plan at $30/month which gives you unlimited access to the internet over the 3g network.  The contract also requires a voice plan.  The least exensive is $40/month for 450  rollover minutes.  A text plan is optional and extra.<br>  <br>  It's a great phone and fun toy if you can afford it.  The apps are amazing and I say that never having paid for one.<br>  <br>  Downsides beside the price - battery life could be better, the 3g network isn't that strong everywhere.  You need a case and they're not cheap - and probably a screen protector.  They scratch easily.

8svzhBAFaa	It depends on your needs. Most people can't go wrong with a Nokia, so see what's available from them. I have the LG Viewty KU990, it has a nice big touchscreen and lots of cool features including a 5MP camera and 87MB internal storage.<br>  <br>  What are your needs? Do you want a good camera? Lots of space? Music playing capabilities? Or video? Internet browsing? What will you use your phone for, other than making calls and sending messages? How much are you willing to spend? Will you want a phone that connects to your PC?<br>  <br>  Consider all of this and add it as Additional Details.<br>  <br>  Once again, Nokia is a good, affordable, all-purpose brand if you're not sure.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Okay, so you're looking at prepaid then, if you're into texting you should look at a phone with a keyboard perhaps. The LG Venus and LG Dare are good touch screen phones, and Telus is selling them for $99 however this is on contract. Your best bet is to go into the store and ask them to show you some phones around the $100 mark and tell them what you want to use it for. You can't get much for $100 these days though, and you may have to end up paying a bit more. It will be worth it to get a phone you want - after all, you're gonna be stuck with it for the next year or so at least, so make it something you want.|`|GV4ipAp8aa	i liike lg keybo,<br>  its good for texting.<br>  if thats what you like to do..
hLkpuG9Xaa	Well out of the d40-d90 range, the d90 is obviously the best (because it has the highest number ;)).<br>  <br>  The d200 is sort of...in a different class, but nearly the same as the d90. As somebody else said it..<br>  <br>  "The D90 is basically a D300 sensor with D200 AF in a D80 size body."<br>  <br>  The main difference between the D90 and D200 is the camera body itself, and the fact that the D90 has video. <br>  <br>  The D90 has better high ISO performance. It also has a 3 inch LCD screen compared to 2.5 inch on the D200. <br>  <br>  The D200 has a higher FPS (at 5 fps) while the D90 has 4.5. The D200 also has weather sealing.<br>  <br>  It all depends on what kind of photographer you are! If you'd like to use video, need a bright screen, and shoot in low light, go for the D90. The D200 is more for outdoors/sports.<br>  <br>  Really though, the D90 and the D200 are around equal.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|BUpo8j6Paa	it always start with... <br>  1. what's your budget?<br>  2. where's your interests? serious amateur or just snapshooting?<br>  <br>  for answer to (1), if you can afford, definitely go for the best! Purchasing the best will define your interests as a serious amateur - and this I will recommend Nikon D700.<br>  <br>  If you are just a snapshooter - for record of events n fun, then stick to the Nikon Coolpix cameras.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	Check out dpreview.com It gives reviews on all the cameras you mention. You can compare which camera best suits you. <br>  <br>  I have owned a Nikon D50 (which is discontinued). I now own a Nikon D80. I have never used any others, so I can't give personal input. I love the D80.<br>  <br>  You really should give yourself a budget. Even if you can afford the most expensive camera, you also have to consider the lenses. They're not cheap.<br>  <br>  What kind of photography do you plan to do? That is something you should decide before buying any lens. <br>  <br>  Wildlife..70-300mm or higher telephoto<br>  Macro.. macro lens (I use a sigma 105mm)<br>  portrait..the 50mm is good.<br>  landscape.. something ranging 18-135, with a wide angle is nice to have.<br>  <br>  Don't forget your camera bag, tripod, extra batteries and cards. <br>  <br>  I know you only asked about the camera. But everything else does have to be consider before you start spending money. <br>  <br>  The camera is important, but the lenses are more important. Also remember, even with the most expensive camera can come out the most horrible of pictures. It's the photographer who makes the photo, not the camera. So since you are new to the DSLR world, I think you would be better with a lower end body. D60 or D80. The D40 is a manual mode camera. If your lens is not an auto focus lens, then you'll have to manually focus.|`|TwIK4Ivlaa	The main advantages of these models are-<br>  <br>  D40-<br>  better flash sync speed than D60<br>  better noise performance at high ISO than D60<br>  Most inexpensive<br>  <br>  D60-<br>  Good in camera image processing including RAW processing.<br>  <br>  D80-<br>  Ability to use all autofocus lenses (camera has a built in motor)<br>  <br>  D90-<br>  Better image processing than D80.<br>  <br>  D200-<br>  Ability to use manual focus old lenses with proper metering.<br>  <br>  As you can see, I have not included anything about MP, dust reduction, video mode etc since they, in my opinion are not important.<br>  <br>  Now choose your model as per your needs-<br>  Among D40 and D60, base your decision on the fact if you want to work on computer later on (post-processing) or not.<br>  D80 provides more range of autofocus lenses that can be used and two other small features that I like - Depth of field button and top panel LCD.<br>  D90 is better version of D80 but it helps in terms of photography if you depend on computer less.<br>  D200 permits use of many old lenses too and makes sense if you already have a collection of good lenses. (D300 once again has better image processing)<br>  <br>  I rely on computers for post-processing and so for me it makes very little difference what the camera does for this. D40 is a good camera to buy if you are starting from scratch since you'll have a lot of spare money for lenses.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Well the higher the number the better the camera is overall. That said there is little need for you to buy the top of the line model. You are obviously a beginner so stick with the cheaper models and learn how to use an SLR properly. While you are learning start building your lens collection. The lenses will make a much bigger difference in image quality than the camera will. In 2 or 3 years when you can competently use the camera on the manual mode in all conditions then you can upgrade to a better camera. Before that and you wont appreciate the difference.|`|ZmYTngnFaa	I think firstly that you can't get a straight answers because each Nikon is good for different purposes<br>  If you want a nice camera to take good pictures anywhere a d40 - d60 will be good for you<br>  I used my friend's d200, and it was great, had good focus, and a great lense to boot, but it is expensive<br>  for professional photography dx300 and d300 just came out recently and have amazing shot writted all over them<br>  Good luck (I'm aiming to get a d90 myself :) )|`|d55HYaktaa	D3x is the best. $8000 body only.|`|qR4xcTfaaa	The D40x and D60 from Nikon are okay BUT:<br>  You should seriously look in to buying a new D80, it is much more solid than both D60 & D40, it is a PRO level camera and the price just dropped by 33%.<br>  With the D80 you can use *ALL* NIKON NIKKOR Auto Focus lenses, but with the D40x & D60 you can only use DX lenses. This will prevent you from upgrading in the future to a FX full frame cameras.<br>  <br>  Also, the physical size of the sensor on both the D80, D200and D90 is the same - 1.5 smaller than 35mm cameras, the D80 have a CCD sensor which means that Higher physical density is better Image quality. However, the D90 is a CMOS sensor and with the extra Mega Pixels 12.3Mp the physical density will create heavy graininess when you leave the Easy situations of Sunny days and go into hard ones like high ISO and darkness, cloudy etc. If you shoot the D80 at NEF (Raw) you can print almost any size picture just like the D90.<br>  There is no other major difference Between them, except for the live view in the D90 which is not really needed for the avid SLR users<br>  <br>  <br>  Therefor you should definitely go with the D80 it is very user friendly you will be very happy with it as I am, I guaranty it. <br>  You can buy it on Ebay new with many accessories for less than $500.<br>  <br>  I recommend for you to start with a mid level lens, the lenses that come with the camera are low end;<br>  You must always remember - The LENS is the most important part of the picture, therefor you should invest in mid to high end lenses.<br>  Starting with 24-85mm F2.8/4.0 is a very good serious amateur lens for wide angle(or 24-120mm) this lens is great for Landscape, portrait and micro pictures. Also the 16-85mm. As for Tele Zoom I recommend the 80-200mm F2.8 ED even if you get it used from a good owner (new is almost $1000 or you can get the TOKINA model or TEMRON etc) this lens is great for wild life photography. with these 2 lenses you can not go wrong, the first lens also have a 1:2 Micro capability and since the D40 is a DX camera it will be 1:1.5, this will allow you to get very Very close to a flower or butterfly etc.<br>  The range will be 35-117mm and 117-290mm since they are FX lenses (which also gives you the opportunity in the future to upgrade to an FX camera and then

This would be a center speaker, a pair of front speakers, a pair of rear speakers and a subwoofer.  That makes 6 speakers.  You need to attach these speakers to an amplifier of some sort.

THIS is the device through which you must run any source audio (i.e. cable, DVD player, etc.)  I'll say this again: All audio must be run through the surround sound system if you want to hear the source in surround format.<br>  <br>  All video must be sent to the TV, either directly from the source or else through the surround sound system and out again to the TV.|`|1b408d552c3c135a0e5f4218c5cd6e80aa	If your TV is HD the simple solution is hooking up the digital audio, it is one cord or fiber-optic cable from the theater to the TV. If your TV and theater is HD compatible then the HDMI cable should do the trick. Not exactly sure if you are having problems hooking up the speakers or  not, but here it goes, the receiver has red and black terminals on the back, they are marked (Front L Front R) (Surround L Surround R) and (Center) just look on the back of the speakers it should tell you which goes where. If your home theater has digital audio, and your TV, DVD player, etc has them as well use that instead it is usually a single cable hook up, the sound will be transmitted into the digital format of what you are watching or listening to in 5.1, DTS, etc. Hope this helps|`|215b035748608804cd9b5e5a1c54043baa	if your tv has an audio out or headphone jack then you can.

YBYnZlP8aa	I often record phone calls and conversations related to my business. These are typically witness interviews dealing with an insurance loss. Both parties are aware of the recording. I have found phone voice recordings to be much more useful than a written statement.<br>  <br>  You will need a device to record the phone calls. The Olympus TP7 Telephone Recording Device has been getting good reviews at various websites.<br>  <br>  The device works by inserting the earpiece into your ear prior to beginning the call. You then plug the male adapter into your tape recorder. Hit record. Then proceed to use your phone as you normally would. The microphone in the earpiece picks up the audio from the other parties voice as well as your own voice.<br>  <br>  You could also start the recording process in the middle of a cell phone call if needed.<br>  <br>  This is from an article on eHow - which I authored: How to Record Cell Phone Calls. It works for land line phones as well.  Check it out if you like. I also included a link to state by state law on recording. Hope this helps.|`|UfrkVNrgaa	you would need a telephone pickup. do exercise caution as in MOST (not just some) areas, recording conversations is illegal. this is purely for educational purposes and i am not responsible should you use this in violation of the law<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.olympus-europa.com/consumer/2587_TP-7_Telephone_Pick-up.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.olympus-europa.com/consumer/2...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/36-010" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcmelectronics.com/product/36...</a><br>  <br>  The one with the suction cup is easier to find (and probably cheaper) in most electronics hobby shops like radio shack

nkMbQFv7aa	If your home entertainment device does not respond to the remote control after trying all of the codes listed for your brand, or if your brand is not listed at all, try searching for your code.<br>  <br>  Example: You've tried all the codes for your Sony HT-CT100 , but you still cannot get the remote control to operate your Sony HT-CT100 .<br>  <br>  1)Turn on your Sony HT-CT100  <br>  2)On the remote control, press AUX key once. <br>  3)Then press and hold SETUP until the AUX key blinks twice, then release the SETUP key. <br>  4)Using the number pad, enter 9-9-1. The AUX key will blink twice. <br>  5)Aim the remote control at the Sony HT-CT100 and slowly alternate between pressing Power key and AUX key. Stop when the Sony HT-CT100 turns off after pressing the POWER key. This means that a working code has been found. <br>  6)Press the SETUP key once to lock in the code. The AUX key will blink twice.

TwIK4Ivlaa	The light enters the eye-ball through the pupil and bounces around inside the eye. The retina is red in colour (due to abundant blood supply and pigmentation) and so this bounced light takes the red colour. Later this bounced light comes out of the eye-ball and enters the camera.<br>  <br>  This is what creates an effect of red colour in the center of the pupil. (In animals like cats and dogs, this reflex appears as yellow and even green depending on the pigementaion of the retina)<br>  <br>  This reflex is used by optometrists to check refractive error too so as to prescribe glasses.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As can be understood from what causes the red eye, there are many factors on which it depends on. The main factors that increase this chance are-<br>  <br>  When the light source (flash) and the camera lens are close to each other causing the light to be bounced back from retina straight back into the camera.<br>  <br>  When the pupil is dilated, like in dim light situations or after taking alcohol. <br>  <br>  When the refractive error is almost zero.<br>  <br>  It also occurs more frequently in persons whose media inside the eye is clear from front to back. It's rare in persons who have cataract or some similar problem.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  More common methods to reduce the red eye are-<br>  <br>  Increasing the distance between flash and the camera lens so that their path is not parallel.<br>  <br>  Asking the subjects to look at something bright in order to constrict the pupil. Some flashes emit multiple annoying flashes before the main flash to constrict the pupil.<br>  <br>  Bouncing the flash from roof or some reflector.<br>  <br>  Telling the subject to look away from camera.<br>  <br>  And the best advice I like to give for parties- Click the photographs before the drinks are served !|`|j5Apt8hWaa	The reflection is from the eye.  The cause is having the on board electronic flash too close to the axis of the lens ... that is why you see many pros using a flash bracket, high above the camera<br>  <br>  In reality, the dedicated external flash units are far enough off axis to  prevent redeye from being an issue|`|QsVMeaPXaa	Yes, all the blood vessels in the retina. The retina has more blood vessels per unit than any other part of the body.

Rs1Mc34paa	First off, make sure your friend's iPhone 3G firmware is not 2.2.1 and make sure that it was NEVER updated to 2.2.1 or else it can NEVER be unlocked. When Apple released the 2.2.1 firmware for the iPhone 3G, it upgraded its base band so that it would not be able to be unlocked.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you will first have to jailbreak using QuickPWN (there are other programs that do this but I think this is the easiest). Just go to <a href="http://www.quickpwn.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.quickpwn.com</a> and download the necessary files for jailbreak. From there just run the program and follow the directions, make sure you install Cydia.<br>  <br>  After the Jailbreak process is done, open the Cydia app and then under the search menu, type in "yellow". Something called yellowsn0w should pop up in the search list. Just select it and then select "Install" on the top right corner. Then select "Confirm" and it will install the software onto your iPhone. After that, the iPhone should be unlocked to work with T-Mobile. However, you cannot pick up 3G signal with it, only the EDGE network.<br>  <br>  If you do all this and it doesn't work, your friend probably lied about never updating to the 2.2.1 firmware. Downgrading the iPhone's firmware will not reverse the upgrade made to the base band. Also, be warned that jailbreaking voids the warranty and you risk turning the iPhone into a brick. It also makes the iPhone OS a little buggy depending on what you install after the jailbreak.|`|RCdm5LzAaa	you need to jailbreak the device and then use a sim cart attachment to unlock it.  try here:  <a href="http://www.gsmunlocklabs.com/unlock-iphone-card-international-shipping-p-255.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsmunlocklabs.com/unlock-ipho...</a>|`|3xDVu0t9aa	you can unlock it <br>  just search youtube for a video<br>  unlocking means you can use the phone with any sims card|`|Sm6IBKYjaa	I would suggest you to unlock it using <a href="http://www.easyiphoneunlocking.com/index3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.easyiphoneunlocking.com/index...</a> .

0b954de4c119d55962a773440128a1b3aa	Yes, there could be asbestos insulation on the wires (most likely place for it), since asbestos was widely used as insulation for decades.  If the case is cracked, the phone has limited collectible value, in any case.  But if the wires are in good shape, not frayed, the danger is minimal, I would say.<br>  <br>  Asbestos gets all kinds of alarm signals, but cases of asbestosis are mainly from those who came in contact with asbestos over long periods of time and in large quantities.  Personally I think the scare is inflated, since asbestos was used so much, yet we dont see a lot of asbestosis cases.  Lung cancer can be caused by asbestos exposure, but most lung cancer cases are caused by smoking.  Also, if you have ever walked past the demolition of a building, you probably inhaled asbestos dust many times in your life.  It is found as a common element in the air in most parts of the US.<br>  <br>  If you want to be totally safe, throw the phone out.|`|7aef909c84851a252a9b0bf47f905876aa	The asbestos would have to be friable to be of concern.....

You can either fix it or get a new XBOX.  However some food for thought.<br>  <br>  1. You can trade in your xbox even if it doesn't work for partial credit- I got like $40<br>  <br>  2. Buy a new one- you want it to have a nice long life expectancy so if you can avoid used...do it.<br>  <br>  3. Make sure you transfer all your files off the old hard-drive onto a memory card so you don't lose your saves.<br>  <br>  4. If you have HIFI cables hooked up don't trade them in...look for your originals and turn them in.

73dce300bea6aeccdadacd97c8b3e99baa	You can take the memory stick to wal-mart and use the machine there to develop the pix.  If you don't want to do that you can burn the pix to a CD and take that to wal-mart or something like it and they will develop them for you.|`|394f5c9fb9cb7218c7e56258842e753baa	You can take the memory stick into a store like Walmart, Target or Costco. Many other stores will do it as well. Take it to the photo department (where you would normally develop a film camera). Then they can develop the pictures for you. A drawback to this is that you might want to sort out pictures to put on the memory stick or else they might print some pictures you don't want.<br>  <br>  Target has this service where you sit at home at your computer, select a few pictures from the memory stick, then pick a local Target store (not all have it) and they will print out the pictures and then you can pick them up from the Target store.<br>  <br>  Or, if you get a decent photo printer and buy photo paper, you can print them out yourself from home without taking the stick anywhere.
AA11598630	I bought a Canon Digital Rebel and I love it. This camera is spendy, $800-1000 for newest models, however, the clarity of details in the pictures this camera takes is absolutely amazing. It takes pictures of higher resolution than standard film cameras. (Who were once thought to be the only ones to take the highest quality pictures.) It is very easy to use and has a wide variety of settings. So, if you're just learning, it can really motivate you to keep trying. However, one of the main reasons why I bought this specific camera was because it could take a rapid succession of pictures. Which is great for action shots. Because sometimes you can't absolutely catch the exact moment when a shot is its best so you can take a couple seconds worth of pictures (depending on quality), and choose the best shot on the easy to use playback screen. One more thing, the zoom on the play back screen is also miraculous. You could zoom in on someone's nose if you take their picture from 15 ft away. Definitely look into what Canon has to offer.|`|QeZRGYuwaa	The best Camera in my opinion is the Kodak V610 but for you maybe a kodak easyshare C310.|`|AA11945200	For something you can just stick in your pocket, the Fuji Finepix F30 is supposed to be pretty sh*thot  <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2006_reviews/fuji_f30.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.steves-digicams.com/2006_revi...</a><br>  <br>  While the Fuji A500 is good if on a tighter budget <a href="http://www.steves-digicams.com/2006_reviews/fuji_a500.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.steves-digicams.com/2006_revi...</a>|`|73dce300bea6aeccdadacd97c8b3e99baa	It all depends on how much money you want to spend.  Sony and Kodak are very dependable cameras, but all around they are all good.  The main thing you want to look at is the megapixels the more megapixels the camera has the better quality the pictures will be.  Also you might want to consider having a optical zoom with a digital zoom option.  This also results in better quality pictures.

A few good exclusives<br>  <br>  Con:<br>  1. $500-$600<br>  2. Because online play is free many 3rd party games will not support online multiplayer.<br>  3. PS3 has lost a few 1st and 3rd party publishers and developers.<br>  4. EA has claimed that it is harder to port games to the PS3 because of the Blu-ray technology. They stated that it will take a lot longer to port Crysis to the PS3 from the PC. So some game companies may not want to go through the hastle of porting their games over to the PS3.<br>  5. Doesn't come with HD cables<br>  6. Blu-ray takes up 2-4 times more space on a hard drive than regular format.<br>  7. It will need 6 months to a year to work out all its bugs<br>  8.

HD-DVD player is extra, but is one of the best looking <br>  HD-DVD players out there.(in my opinion)<br>  <br>  The PS3 may have slightly better graphics, but the 360 is better in almost every other way. Besides most game companies don't take advantage of the power of the systems. Just like the last-gen games, no one showed the true power of the Xbox until Ubisoft unleashed Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.<br>  <br>  I think its kind of like the difference between Plasma and LCD. Sure the Plasmas(PS3) look better(not much better), but they also don't last as long and have a better chance of getting a picture burnt in on the screen. While the LCDs(Xbox 360) are cheaper, look great, have a less chance of burn-in, and are slightly more compact. The LCD's have more bang for your buck.|`|45a39ce196cafb276d285502baef831baa	The xbox 360 because it's cheaper, and it can do more things than the PS3, even though the PS3 does have better graphics.|`|AA11090295	PS3 for sure<br>  <br>  1. The system is like 99% backwards compatible unlike the xbox where you have to download an update for every game you put in, then it only plays about a quarter of the xbox games if that even.<br>  <br>  2. I had a 360 and it broke after 5 months, it only comes with a 3 month warranty and the ps3 comes with a year.<br>  <br>  3. The 360 looks cheap, the controllers are cheap and the D-pad is god awful<br>  <br>  4. The PS3 had a FREE online network to play games<br>  <br>  5. The PS3 has a bigger hard drive that can be interchanged with standard notebook hard drives unlike the rip off xbox drive<br>  <br>  6. Blu ray player which holds way more information than standard DVD so game developers will never run out of space<br>  <br>  7. The 360 sounds like a jet engine as where the PS3 is almost silent<br>  <br>  8. The 60 gig ps3 comes with standard memory card options like SD and compact flash.<br>  <br>  Finally, the only negative thing I have to say about the ps3 is that if you have an older HDTV that doesn't support 720p it downscales to Standard Definition, but there is supposedly a fix for that coming in a firmware update.<br>  <br>  I love my ps3 and i'm glad I bought it, the xbox 360 had nice graphics when I had it but it did suffer some massive slow down in graphically intense games..|`|af570934fe80290140b8448b674c074faa	PS3 it is much more better than xbox360 it has better graphics<br>  the price is much higher but it worth it|`|f3327f9263420258c8ed3fbf585d6322aa	Your question is very vague.<br>  <br>  Its a personal perference. <br>  <br>  But if you need soild concrete evidence to get whichever set, you could do the read up here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation...</a>
AEkpzmA8aa	Wow.. rfu adapter.  How old is your tv?  The last time I used an rfu adapter was on my 8-bit NES back in the 80's.<br>  <br>  Nintendo store has no listing for a Wii RFU adapter so I'm guessing that there will never be an official one from nintendo.  There may be one from a 3rd party out there or maybe in the future but... lol.. time for a new tv, perhaps?|`|TKw2Q4gQaa	I'm sure someone knows.|`|1rkCsGH1aa	wii is already out|`|TJ41tlknaa	I don't think the Wii supports an RFU adapter. Can't you just get an adapter for your TV so that it can use the standard A/V cables? I think that's better than waiting for an add-on that may not even exist.

With memory stick slots on the PS3 makes it easier to transfer videos music & photos onto its 20GB or 60GB hard drive. It also can play PS2 and PS One games, and dvds. It has you can also go on the internet and it even has its own instant messeging program. If you have a PSP your able to hook that up to the PS3 and tranfer files from your PSP to the PS3. You will also be able to use it in more many different things in games (like as the controller and rear view mirror in Formula 1). Plus theres games like Resistance Fall of Man, Madden, and Warhawk (which uses the motion sensors). If there are and glitches or problems i'm sure you will be able to fix them with the system updates, just like the PSP has.

CkRUN4wwaa	No. Although a CD contains an injection-molded clear polycarbonate plastic, a thin reflective aluminium layer is added to fill the bumps that are imprinted into the polycarbonate layer. An acrylic layer is sprayed over the top of the aluminium to protect it.<br>  <br>  When a laser is reading a disc, it runs along the tracks of the cd (along the bumps and pits). When the laser hits a pit, it causes the reflection of the laser to deflect out to the side. A detection device known as an optical pickup actually detects the laser when it is relfected off the bumps.<br>  <br>  Therefore, it is necessary to have a reflective layer so that the laser will reflect back off the disc and be detected by the cd reading device (CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, CD player etc.). Having a clear disc would allow the laser to travel straight through like light passing through a pane of glass.|`|ecfd8a273d25eeaf71b3b7013eabbcdcaa	yes just dont put nothig on them|`|tDDZMX7Taa	Why would you even want to do that?

It has the ability to play MP3's, videos, view pictures, get on the internet, in addition to being able to play all of those sweet games on the run.  Not to mention the screen is twice the size of the Ipod Video, and it cost less.  You can never run out of memory because you can get more memory sticks for it.

Why? Because all games for the Xbox 360 are in high-definition and the graphics are pretty much the same as the PS3. There's built-in support for wireless controllers and excellent online gaming, content downloads, and communications via Xbox Live. The console is not only backward compatible with many (but not all) original Xbox titles, but it also doubles as a superior digital media hub and Windows Media extender.

Right now the ps3 and 360 graphically are barley visible in differences and the xbox has been out for a while, meaning that games for ps3 might take 6 months to year to start utilizing all of the ps3's power. The ps3 has a totally new development platform so people are still learning the tricks to make games beautifull, all in all I think that the ps3 is going to have more and more features constantly coming its way. Team executer has already hooked up a 750gig external hard drive to the ps3 and backed up entire games but are not yet able to play them from the hard drive.|`|a90cba89948b93e3fe85b3c2ea3391e7aa	The xbox 360 i have one and trust me rreally fun<br>  <br>  ill break it down for u <br>  <br>  xbox 360~400 dollar version better deals good games like gears of war, halo, and the online play is soo much fun and its a reall good gaming machine<br>  <br>  <br>  ps3~600 dollar one comes with 60 gb memory 500 dollar one comes with 20 gb memory the online reason people mihgt consider it good is because of blue ray but to have the blue ray graphcis come out u would need to buy a certain tv and plus without the blue ray it would be crappy its barley a little more updated but i would take xbox 360|`|accace1d5de333419213b650a6f7788daa	well, the ps3 is more of a multimedia machine. the 360 goes closer to a gaming part than the ps3 for now. but if you are one of those graphic fanboy, i suggest u get the 360 if u want a system right now. but if u want to spend about $600, then i suggest u get the 360 and the wii.|`|af6d8eab66c9753e6e2d059b1fad20b3aa	Right now the 360 has better graphics and a lot of different games and its cheaper too.|`|f3327f9263420258c8ed3fbf585d6322aa	i'd go for the 360 till more games are released for the ps3<br>  <br>  I'm still considering a wii myself too.|`|fc8bf320c59e14c7bb57c3965881382eaa	Xbox 360, because with a PlayStation 3 you have to buy a certain TV format to go with it that can cost up to $700! it is better to buy either the Xbox360 or get a Nintendo Wii, the actual console itself (PS3) only costs around $200 it is the specific format that really wheres you out

fb853422e09a2875b266e36abbc79816aa	Best Answer - Chosen by Asker<br>  <br>  PS3 is the best, do not be fooled by prices or people telling you they like a system that is limited to only a few games.<br>  <br>  PS3 is the fastest, has the most capabilities, and has the most games and developers<br>  <br>  PS3 has a 60 gig hard drive, There isnt a need for a card to save game play data on anymore. It has Bluetooth wireless 802.11 networking and controllers. The controller doesnt need replacement batteries, you simply connect it USB with the extention they provided you with and it recharges or you can connect it for non wireless play. PS3 is HDTV display 480i and 1080i and also displays on A/V connection. You can install another OS (operating system) to the PS3 and switch from Sony's OS to the other (so far Linix is available, Vista will be available after it's release) You can save Pictures, Music, and Videos on the system that Sony has supplied which gives great playback features and organizing, it has a Memory Stick Reader that most PC's have now too. You use this for game saves that you want to take with you, or for Music and media files you want to save on it from your PC. It has a Web Browser and Online Sony store with free dowloads and game previews, also a Messenger Application that can connect you to any PS3 user, It has a update feature built in for fixes to bugs and data, also a backup feature and restore feature. It plays PS1 PS2 and PS3 games and also can connect via BlueTooth wireless to a PSP and enter act or share data and media. It plays BlueRay DVD's, CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-ROM, DVD-RW, DVD's, PictureDiscs, Video CD's. and a ton more features... <br>  <br>  HAVE YOU SEEN THE PRICES OF BLU-RAY DVD PLAYERS? This feature alone wins this discussion already.<br>  <br>  Wii and 360 are limited systems with limited capabilities and limited games.<br>  <br>  360 has online game play, for a fee of course. Wii said they will launch online game play in a year (they said that about the GameCube too, never happened)<br>  <br>  PS games are free to play online. Only one game was made that required payment for online play that was FFXI, and that was because it was also online PC playable. <br>  <br>  PS3 and Sony has most companies in exclusitivity contracts for game titles. PS has the most games and gets the most developement.|`|7eb768d672b51e83645631ed6a0359d0aa	Buy both if you have doubt and/or you can afford it. <br>  In case you want to play Halo probably Xbox is the only hope. <br>  For most of other games any of the console is good enogh. PS3 should be better as of now as it is new and it plays PS2 games. Its little costly and stores are ripping off people as of now. I saw some ad for like a 1000 bucks. Of course games were bundled but none that I wanted.|`|AA11547859	PS3, it has motion sensors, like the Wii (it is the main controls for the game Warhwk) Theres also Blu-ray disc drive, which normally costs $1,000, thats why it costs so much.

But the 360 has a wider selection of games because it has been out a year.  The ps3 though you can do so much more stuff with and if you have an internet connection you can take your ps3 online through it, serf the internet, and go on the playstation store.  And its all free unlike the xbox's service which is a bit better but not that much better to pay $60 a year for.  The ps3's online capabilities will mature over time to eclipse those of the 360's (and you can use wi-fi on the ps3).  Also with a ps3 you don't have to worry about it overheating and it is extremely silent.  The 360 does have the better games at the moment as i said above but the ps3 will become the dominate of the 3 consoles because it is that much better than a 360 and no one cares about the wii.  And the ps3 comes with the blu ray drive so you can play all your new blu ray dvds and is the major factor for the price difference between the 2 consoles.  You have to pay $200 for the hd-dvd drive add on for the 360.  The only reason why the 360 has better graphics right now is that it has had time to mature because it has been out for a year.  Give the ps3 a year and you will see the difference in the graphics.|`|AA10280246	unless your willing to fork over like 1500 bucks on ebay ( since you cant find them anywhere else) (and people are trying to scam you out of your money all over ebay) id go for the xbox 360... ps3 just isnt worth the money.
debc88ae42496e4842ad5d7b3edfb5c6aa	not sure what your question is ....use a psp as a controller?  yes u can use psp as a controller for the ps3.  If u ask how? u need to go to ps3 screen and scroll down to controller u will c psp as one of the controller...If u ask why would anyone want to do that? it because most ppl already acustom to the control of psp and u wouldn't want to have alot of ps3 wireless control when two is good enough. beside it expensive...|`|73dce300bea6aeccdadacd97c8b3e99baa	You need to have the 60 gig PS3 since it has the WiFi.

73dce300bea6aeccdadacd97c8b3e99baa	Congrats on getting a PSP.<br>  <br>  To use the wi-fi you need to have a wireless acces point.  It is kind of like haveing a signal on your cell phone so you can use it.  To get this you either have to go somewhere that has a wi-fi access point or you can get a wireless router, or the wi-fi max.  You don't need to hook your PSP up to the computer to use it because it is totally wireless.

Chances are it has security on it.  You need to have the password to get on.  If you are just going to a resteraunt to find an access point  you might have to pay to get on it.

6b6f45a44f155996dc2f477ff18a81a3aa	There isn't any reset button. If you need to get out of a game than you simply press the 'HOME' key in the bottom left corner. However, if you have already changed the games out and you are wanting to play the one that you just put in the screen might freeze when you select quit game. If this happens your best option is to take the battery pack out. It is located on the back side, usually where your palm would sit. You simply take off the back panel (no tools needed) and remove the battery. As soon as you put the battery back in all you have to do is turn the system back on like you normally would and you should be back in business. Good Luck!|`|73dce300bea6aeccdadacd97c8b3e99baa	There isn't one if you can you can shut it all the way down by pushing and holding the power button up until the green light shuts off.  If you can't do that just take the battery out and put it back in.  If your in a game you could always just go back to the PSP's main screen and restart the game.|`|3860b64276a3f8e27ac06fa92c1463fcaa	Nowhere. If the PSP is froze you can let it run until the battery runs out. My PSP froze of something, then i let it run the whole night. When i woke up, i saw it ran out of battery. I charged it and then turned it on, it worked perfectly fine.

For example if you had a drive in your computer for a regular memory stick and not a memory stick duo you would put the memory stick duo in the adapter and put that into your computer to access the files without using the USB cable to hook your PSP up to the computer.|`|20344175432b1d40553014c44bb44916aa	well a memery stick has many uses.

73dce300bea6aeccdadacd97c8b3e99baa	No way.  There is no way a cell phone could handle the complexity of todays high tech games.  The information that would have to pass through it alone would make it unplayable.  Let alone that it wouldn't be able to process the cutting edge graphics of todays games.

73dce300bea6aeccdadacd97c8b3e99baa	Why would you want to if you want a computer by a computer with decent specs.  In terms of hardware specs the xbox 360 is way out of date.  Get a real computer and don't ruin your 360 trying to install vista.  Especially since there are no programs that need to have vista to run.  Well exept vista.
bbe06c0dd8860e9fc94418583b265b24aa	FlyFF is better than Runescape and so is MapleStory.<br>  <br>  WoW rocks!!! (i wish i played it though....)|`|89af4fdfbd40910808c67a3d3c57b756aa	Runescape sucks..here are a few better<br>  ragnarok<br>  world of warcraft, you can play private server for free.I can tell u how<br>  tibia (bad graphics though)<br>  conqour online<br>  maple story|`|c8843b976a5f04c08297b26e5c115685aa	I recommend World of Warcraft, the new expansion is out today!

Innovative control scheme, games everyone can play, cheaper price.  <br>  <br>  The PS3 has Resistance...and...uhh...hmmm.<br>  <br>  Get the Wii now, get the PS3 when games actually start coming out for the $500/$600 machine.|`|0f48f6ca20c04f278bd63169653a602aaa	ps3. wii's r g@y lol|`|0fMLMFJ6aa	it really depends what kind of gaming you're looking to do.  If you just wanna sit on your couch and chill...i'd get the ps3.  But if you really like getting into your games and find yourself moving around alot anyways...i'd say the wii is perfect.  It really is very unique and you'll find yourself (and any friends/family) getting addicted very quickly.|`|6ead68c3c622518eab87bf4d6b48e747aa	i heard that wiis are better but i also heard that when playing with a wii it flings out of ur hand and break and u cant return it !!<br>  id also go with the better kind b/c the better it is the longer itll last|`|M7pBuoQNaa	I got my Nintendo Wii for free.

9acf9f103c79d71cdbdc8e78bb1fc754aa	Back in the day Gameshark used to be better, but nowadays I would go with the action replay, more support, more codes, easy to manipulate

0fa06d21350981f12884ff70081155c2aa	The new warthogs actually look somewhat like ATVs.

Go to bungie.net to find out more about the new weapons. Some weapons I know about is a Spartan Laser which should be awesome. And a spike grenade which should be interesting to see. Should be a great game though.|`|AA10803194	They did put ATV's, its a 2 seater its built for recon only, good for games like ctf. The multiplayer demo will come out this spring via Xbox live. Where have you been man, lots of news on this game already!|`|9acf9f103c79d71cdbdc8e78bb1fc754aa	Yeah they did put the ATV's in there and the Beta test version is coming out this spring for those who get in. I already got accepted...but you can too, but you have to buy crackdown for 360..which doesn't look all that great. But if you wanna learn more about whats to come with Halo 3 i suggest going to IGN.com they are the bomb dig.
AA10458904	yes!|`|0fa06d21350981f12884ff70081155c2aa	yes you can, if you need help send me a friend request: v3ndetta III (<capital i's)<br>  <br>  p.s. michael I, you don't get banned from superjumping, ever. you usually never have time to do it but people do, even pros. just check out their montages on the internet. people ALWAYS do them.|`|3HMnLpGcaa	Without cheating no, don't ruin XBox live with juvenile cheating. It ruins the whole system and you risk banishment from the service if caught (which happens more often then you think).|`|9acf9f103c79d71cdbdc8e78bb1fc754aa	Thats kinda a vague question? If your talking halo, yeah you can super jump if you know how to. I do it all the time. Its not considered cheating, more of an exploit in the game that anyone can do with the right knowledge. If ya wanna learn some hit up my gamer tag...Corey1317|`|bFKVf2hAaa	yeah like v3ndetta said, you can and also like he said, you can't get banned for that.
e412551d6c02320bcec6f322a94b18bbaa	If you're asking about using a Sidekick with Verizon, then it's not possible.  Verizon's phones and network are CDMA, which doesn't use sim cards.  The Sidekick is a GSM phone, which requires a sim card in order to work.  They are two completely different technologies and are not compatible with each other.  The closest thing you can get to a Sidekick with Verizon is the LG enV.|`|Kq9T0vTMaa	switch networks|`|Rqr5ORbLaa	sorry thats a dont have... stick with verizon though and get the samsung or the env they both are somewhat similar to what u really want... i think u will enjoy one of those phones better though!
AEkpzmA8aa	Quick charge kit comes with 1 rechargeable battery pack but can charge 2 at once.  If you have more than 1 controller you have to buy a new battery pack for them.  Play and Charge kit also comes with 1 battery pack, but I pretty sure it takes much longer to charge than the Quick Charge kit does.  <br>  <br>  The only advantage with the play n charge is that you can tether your controller to the 360 if you run outta juice.|`|0ejCcftpaa	I have a 360 and I haven't tried to charge the stock batteries.

If there's no tv/video button on the tv itself (I assume that that's the button that toggles between all the inputs on your tv) then it has to be on your remote control.

Never move the Xbox 360 while its spinning disc.|`|AEkpzmA8aa	Either you moved the console when the game was spinning or maybe the disc wasn't sitting in the tray properly when the tray retracted into the system.  <br>  <br>  Just call into xbox customer service and make your complaint.

AA11450178	You can use a program called iDump that pulls all your music from your iPod and puts it on your computer.

5bc14969ae70c129c2c3875fd150abd9aa	I would buy the Samsung, based only on the fact that I have had LG's (don't like their menu format), have had multiple Motorolas (have had problems with their bluetooth and signal reception quality) and my neice had a Samsung which survived being dropped in a toilet 3 times.

Enjoy!|`|3a1023df28f31d2db27893b18cfd387caa	Samsung reasoning being is because I have had friends that have had problems with the Razor and Motorola's in general.

bea1a0adbb7d272c62f0ca27cdec8916aa	I'm pretty sure you have the Verizon Wireless Chocolate right?  Put the microSD memory card into your phone there should be a slot for it and it should read what you have on the card as long as the songs weren't bought on iTunes or another legal online music service that you buy the songs off of because those are most often DRM protected.
F7xZqi7Xaa	It's popular and it's convenient. Everybody loves music and now there's an easier way to achieve that dream.

3001ec43990f52710c19ce031a01e342aa	Ok Im pretty sure you need an USB cable. Plug it to your phone and computer. Then when the folder that contains your phone's pictures etc. opens up, open up your music folder that you want to put on your phone. Copy whatever you want on your phone  and paste it to your phone folder<br>  That should help.
bQapeBDOaa	First you plug your ipod into itunes. Then you click and drag songs (or artists) from your library to your ipod folder on itunes (unless you select sync when you plug it in. Which I don't recommend because it put every song on your library to your ipod, and if you had songs from other peoples computers and plug it back into yours it will delete those songs...unless that's what you want)

HD DVDs have more storage so that you can put better graphics on them and an Xbox 360 can play them if you get the expansion for about $50|`|z6icTiajaa	a dual layer dvd has a capacity of 9.3 or 9.4GB while a single layer HD DVD has 15GB and the dual layer version has 30GB.<br>  <br>  They are not the same. A HD-DVD won't play in a normal DVD player.<br>  <br>  The XBOX 360 is capable of playing HD-DVD with the purchase of the additional HD-DVD drive for around $50USD I believe.

09644ZZSaa	To the person that's talking about the phone coming out a long time ago, you're thinking of the Strawberry pink VX8500. I think the subject of this question is the new KG800.<br>  <br>  I work in the wireless business and have two points of advice:<br>  <br>  1) Ok first of all before you buy a Chocolate, there are a few things to know. The Chocolate is a very temperamental phone. The touch buttons are extremely sensitive and it is easy to accidentally scroll past the menu item you intend to highlight. The phone is also known to dial numbers when in a pocket or case, and the auto button lock should prevent this, but rather it often activates while youre using the phone, forcing you to press the side button every 15 seconds or so. I don't recommend the phone for people who are not going to use the mp3 features, and even so, phones don't make excellent mp3 players. Now having said this, some people love the chocolate, but i've heard a lot of complaints from people who didn't know what they were getting into.  I usually let people hold the phone and try navigating the menu before i set up service for them. The majority of the time after having used it they decide on another, better phone like the KRZR.<br>  <br>  2) The pink chocolate is not the same model as the others (KG800 not VX8500) and it too does not have a speakerphone.The controls on it haven't been improved over the VX8500 and navigating the menus are just as tricky.<br>  <br>  Depending on your carrier you will have 15-30 days to return the phone. I'd ask to try a working model at your local wireless store first before dropping the cash for it. Phones like this, (and I anticipate the iPhone will have even more shortcomings) forgo practical function for coolness. My opinion, if you want a fashion accessory, get this phone, if you want a phone buy a MotoKRZR instead.
09644ZZSaa	No. Without the phone service it would function only as an mp3 player, and even then I think they made it so that doesnt function without activation. In order to access the internet you will need a contract with the carrier and a data plan. They might have data plans that don't include a voice plan but i'm not sure. Your best bet is to buy an ipod.|`|mTZzafKXaa	NO,  that wasnt a very intelligent question.
XPWDnL8paa	I have the same problem as you. You should get Koss Sparkplug earphones. They stay in your ears and are only like $15 with shipping on eBay.|`|Gg2Jjksyaa	the newer iPods have a newly designed earphone that isnt as wide and stays in (at least me personally) the ears better.|`|a4152eeee4641cfb780585c58cb34234aa	Well, you're in luck, the Bose company just came out from semi-electromagnetic earbuds, that thru electrons that can penetrate human body cells and create a "pull." This will allow you to run and do stretch exercises and the pull force will keep them tight in your ears. Coming soon!
2351f604a46dd823e49adce9d9a762f5aa	No you do not need itune to transfer your music. Use this program called Sharepod. Its really easy|`|LA75vblUaa	Yes. iTunes is a must to sync music onto your player. Perhaps the easiest and only way. (Other methods may not be legal and blah, who knows). You would need iTunes for any apple music products, iPods, iPhones, and Shuffles. iTunes only support apple products. heh.<br>  <br>  A version of iTunes will come with the music player when purchased, or downloaded from apple.com.<br>  <br>  If you are planning to get a shuffle, I don't recommend it. Yes, it's tiny and has a clip that most players don't but, there's more cons than pros. You can get a player half the size of that with a screen and all that good stuff the shuffle don't (radio, voice recording, radio recording, etc.) Or pitch in $20 and get one that plays videos with a screen (of course) and a whole lot pf functions along with it. Not to mention, it'll hold more songs.|`|VcvNIQF7aa	Itunes yep ,  lime-wire too.|`|XPWDnL8paa	Yes, you need to use the bloated software called iTunes.

04b2339f95c227b7436c171efb3f4a1daa	Dalila,<br>  <br>  A fibra óptica tem muito mais aplica??es do que vc imagina. Além de servirem como enfeites, como vc relatou, as fibras ópticas revolucionaram as telecomunica??es, pois servem para transmitir dados por meio de energia eletromagnética (a luz é também uma energia eletromagnética) à distancia sem praticamente nenhuma perda. Assim vc pode atravessar um cabo de fibra óptica debaixo do Oceano Atlantico (como existem muitos), e sem nenhuma perda, aquela informa??o que vc enviou chegará do outro lado, quase que instantaneamente, com um custo baixo, pois praticamente n?o há perdas e o material é relativamente barato. <br>  <br>  Retirei do Wikipédia sobre o que se fala sobre fibra óptica. Dê uma lida:<br>  "Fibra óptica é um filamento, de vidro ou de materiais poliméricos, com capacidade de transmitir luz. Estes filamentos têm diametros variáveis, dependendo da aplica??o, indo desde diametros ínfimos, da ordem de micrómetros (mais finos que um fio de cabelo) até vários milímetros. A transmiss?o da luz pela fibra segue um mesmo princípio, independentemente do material usado ou da aplica??o: é lan?ado um feixe de luz numa extremidade da fibra, e pelas características ópticas do meio (fibra), esse feixe percorre a fibra através de consecutivas reflex?es. A fibra possui no mínimo duas camadas: O núcleo e o revestimento. No núcleo ocorre a transmiss?o da luz propriamente dita, embora o revestimento n?o seja menos importante. A transmiss?o da luz dentro da fibra é possível gra?as a uma diferen?a de índice de refrac??o entre o revestimento e o núcleo, sendo que o núcleo possui sempre um índice de refra??o mais elevado, característica que aliada ao angulo de incidência do feixe de luz, possibilita o fenómeno da reflex?o total".<br>  <br>  Assim, no dia que caiu muitos raios e uma fibra brilhou e piscou, é porque a luz do raio incidiu exatamente no núcleo da sua fibra, e ela transmitiu luz. Por isso ela iluminou.<br>  <br>  Abra?os|`|vlwaBCl1aa	Sim, akilo eh fibra optica a fibra optica eh um fiozinho q dentro dele tm varios espelhinhos um voltando a luz para o outro e experimenta quebrar o fiozinho para ver c ele vai continuar funcionando....<br>  acredito q a energia de seu raio se transformou em luz q passou por esse seu fio de fibra optica....

Q3ymnx7Faa	if the Menu + Center button thing wont work, then you might need to bring it to an apple store for diagnosis.... but I would keep trying the menu+center button thing, because if you dont get it perfectly in sync and dont hold it down long enough then it wont work... make sure you count to like at least 15 before releasing..... <br>  <br>  OR, if the screen keeps going blank then it probably needs to be charged up...  unless you've have it for a while and the battery needs to be replaced..|`|mtmVc2FCaa	try holding down the menu button and the middle (select) button for about 15 or 20 seconds. If that doesn't work try giving it a good long charge. My old ipod used to freeze a lot and i'd have to let it die then recharge it. If none of this works you might want to get it checked out or buy a new one, the battery could be permanently dead.

AA11388730	I got the iPhone the day it was released, and it is one cool device. The picture quality and capabilities are awesome. There are some limitations. The speaker for music and video playback is very low (however, still loud enough to hear from a short distance.) Also, there is no video camera yet, and as far as the internet is concerned, not all pages are completely visible because you cannot download Java or Flash yet. Still, surfing the web is very easy. In addition, the iPhone does not allow for multimedia messaging or game/ringtone downloading yet. These things are said to be resolved in the coming months. <br>  <br>  Given the last two days with it, I'd buy it even with all the limitations. Just love it. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you can't afford the iPhone, I also recommend the Motorola SLVR and the Motorola KRAZR. I own both as well, and both are great phones. As far as music/mp3 player, I like the iTunes feature on the SLVR. But, with the KRAZR you can use any mp3 or music file as a ringtone. Also, the camera is much clearer on the SLVR. The size and shape makes it great to look at too.

09644ZZSaa	Those that say charge your cellphone every night are only partially right. While this is true for some people, here are the general tips that you should follow.<br>  <br>  1. Don't charge a cellphone until the battery is low. Not charging a battery every night won't affect the phone in a bad way. Not charging it for a month or more might. It is not good to charge a battery with more than a quarter to a third battery life left.<br>  <br>  2. Some phone batteries, not all, can be damaged by charging significantly longer than it takes to charge. Some phones stop charging when full, others continue charging as long as plugged in, this is bad.<br>  <br>  3. Don't take the phone off the charger until it is fully charged. Interrupting a charge adversely affects the battery life.<br>  <br>  4. IMPORTANT! Don't habitually use a car charger. Car chargers deplete the battery life when used on a regular basis. This is partially due to the fact that the charging gets repeatedly interrupted when you turn off the engine.|`|Z5IxPHSgaa	yes u should charge it every night but not leave it on all night u run the risk of messing up the battery u can over charge a battery, a tech at the store told me so. but at least put it on the charger for a hour or so just to keep a full battery at least.|`|e7073deda810b7dbd0f5a9afb258f6ecaa	Yes.

AA10950302	No, the 1st generation Xbox 360s had the most problems. If you buy the newest Xbox 360, they have the lowest failure rate. And to almost guarantee you're getting a new one, get the 60GB Pro. They are the newest ones to be sent out. If you get an Arcade or Elite, you could still be getting an older one that has either not been sold or just got sent out later. So get the 60GB if you want to reduce your chances of having one that will fail. They are $299.|`|HXahRFKEaa	Nowadays, the new lower priced systems pretty much have the same low-chance. Just check on the box to see what generation it is, or the date when it came out of the factory. My system came with the 2nd radiator that Microsoft puts in when a system is sent in because it the user before me had the RROD, but hadn't had any problems. If you're afraid of getting the RROD, just don't play for 6-8 hours straight.|`|sRKO8s6jaa	No. There have been changes to newer models.<br>  <br>  Heat was a major problem in the older Xbox 360s.<br>  <br>  The 'Falcon' motherboards released last year have more a more reliable heat sink and have a 65nm CPU which release less heat then the older 90nm CPUs. These ones are rumored to have a failure rate of 10-16%<br>  <br>  The 'Jasper' motherboards are rumormed to be coming out very soon. These motherboards are like the 'Falcon' ones but have a 65nm CPU and also a 65nm GPU which were not in the 'Falcon' ones. This way, there is even less heat released by the console.<br>  <br>  All versions have the same hardware. None of them have a less or more chance of getting the RROD.

HumBqZnNaa	There are many sites you can download copied games and also places where you can buy them. The issue here is you need to get you're PS2 'Chipped' before it will play them. The people selling the copied games usually do this for ￡25.00. Be careful though because chipped playstations tend to burn out following extensive use. It's called 'Chipping' because they actually solder a chip inside which overrides the security checker. Hope this helps..!|`|BR1yOqEfaa	Here is a much easier way.. But you need the Fatty version of the PS2 (Older)<br>  Get HDLoader, a PC hard drive and a network adapter.<br>  Make sure the drive is set to Master, attach it to the network adapter and slide it into your PS2. You can now copy games directtly to the hard drive., You can also copy games to your PC and move them to the correct directory on your PS2 hard drive.<br>  <br>  Works great, no modding, no warranty issues, and I can take my hard drive to my bud's house!!|`|AA10158370	honestly not even worth doing as one person mentioned soon they will be able to checdk if your ps3 has been playing pirated material and they may be able to render it useless online by banning the mac address which every ps3 has which is unique to it. think about it ps2 games are like 10 bucks even for the good ones just buy them. trust me this is an expensive and very technologically advanced piece of machinery i would not run any risks with it..|`|FWMja9OLaa	Yes you can.

Very few good exclusives, expensive to own, maintain, and power, and just very bad. It is a very good media center, however. Not as good as XBMC for the original Xbox, but still quite good. If that's what you're looking for, then by all means, get one. But, if you're actually planning to play some games, get a Wii or 360.I have a PS3, and I don't like it at all. The backwards compatibility looks, sounds, and awful, the PSN is underdeveloped and expensive, and many more things I can list, but don't have the time to. In conclusion, I think the PS3 is simply a bad game console.

2LzJC9muaa	Recovery Mode is the way to go:<br>  <br>  Turn off your iPhone by holding the "Sleep/Wake" button for about five seconds and then sliding the red slider. If your iPhone is already off, there's no need to turn it on and then off again. Once it's turned off, press and hold the "Home" button and plug the iPhone into your Mac or PC. Keep holding the "Home" button until you see a dock cable pointing to the iTunes icon. iPhones running older software will display a yellow triangle and text which says "Please Connect to iTunes". You can now release the Home button.<br>  <br>  Open iTunes (if it's not already open) and you will be told that "iTunes has detected an iPhone in recovery mode". Click "OK" and you will be taken to the iPhone pane. Click restore and you're done, it's that easy! Depending on the extent of your iPhone's ills, it may take some time to do a full restore. Once you're done, you should again have a perfectly working iPhone.<br>  <br>  After you fix it....don't use the crappy ziphone to jailbreak. Use pwnage

09644ZZSaa	It might be that the device you're using it in is only compatible with 1 gig memory cards or less. Most portable devices have a limit. The newer phones support 2-4 gig cards while those made as little as one year ago only support 1. When the LG Chocolate first came out it was the only phone to support 2 gig cards. This sounds like the problem. As for why you can only store 986 mbs and not a full gig is because the formatting of the disk uses up some space.|`|dd81982c1180140ced42f2ea5c011551aa	There must be something else in there occupying the memory.

You are probably looking at minimum 3 years before the small consumer level sets come out but they will be probably in the range of 4 to 5 times the price of a comprable lcd set and in a larger home theater size you are looking at probably closer to a decade before they reach the level of proliferation and price that current lcd and plasma tvs are at today.|`|1d0b8f1417c90b159cb177129e2f253eaa	Last I read, fall 2008.|`|6a9Yvrdgaa	This link will tell you what you want to know :<br>  <a href="http://www.hdtvsolutions.com/oled_tv_technology.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hdtvsolutions.com/oled_tv_tec...</a><br>  Good Luck.
dee2aeeacdfd3b88a3a9ab76a5a72b92aa	1) Sony's Bravia line is nice, as are the Pioneer Elites and some Panasonics<br>  <br>  2)  Neither is really better.  They both do the same thing.  Blu Ray has been getting more sales, but nothing earth shattering.  If I had to pick one right now, it would be Blu Ray, mainly because it offers more titles (Sony, Disney, and Fox are Blu ray exclusive, only Universal is HD DVD exclusive).  But it'll also be more expensive.  Whether the extra cost is worth it is up to you.|`|KdlZvJlqaa	Good question, from all my research, including talking to a few techies, i have come down to you should only buy two types of HDTVs: Sony and Samsung.

rvtOlXMDaa	T-Mobile does not allow the change of owner on an account.  They do a credit check on each subscriber (as all carriers do - so they are not unique) before establishing an account.  So, if you trust your buddy to pay the bill, let him use the phone....  But, you will also loose your number to him as well.  All of the carriers consider the account terminated if you port the number over to another carrier.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

8e3cc6d7a159a8a4ca1c3346046739dcaa	The iPhone comes with Cingular service. You just need to choose a plan .<br>  <br>  You can check the iPhone Pricing Plans from<br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/easysetup/rateplans.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/iphone/easysetup/ra...</a><br>  <br>  All plans include visual voicemail, unlimited data (Email/Web), 200 SMS text messages, unlimited nights/weekends (with the exception of the 59.99 plan, which only includes 5000 minutes), Rollover minutes, and unlimited mobile to mobile (AT&T customers only) minutes<br>  <br>  The iPhone has built-in Wi-Fi, with which it is able to access the Internet (through a wireless network) via a modified version of the Safari web browser. <br>  <br>  The iPhone is also able to connect to the Internet through AT&T's EDGE network but is not able to utilize AT&T's 3G/HSDPA network, however Steve Jobs mentioned at the Keynote presentation that 3G support would be a future feature of a new version. The use of the EDGE network instead of 3G has been criticized by analysts. When the user is not in a Wi-Fi hot spot, the iPhone's network connection will use the older EDGE network, which, before the launch, reviewers found that the EDGE network was "excruciatingly slow," with the iPhone taking as long as 100 seconds to download the Yahoo! home page for the first time.Immediately before the launch, however, the observed speed of the network increased to almost 200kbps. This is probably due to the new "Fine EDGE" upgrades AT&T has been making to their network prior to the launch. <br>  <br>  The web browser displays full web pages as opposed to simplified pages as on most non-smartphones. However the iPhone does not support Flash technology.[19] Web pages may be viewed in portrait or landscape mode and support automatic zooming by "pinching" or double-tapping images or text. The iPhone also has Bluetooth 2.x+EDR built in. It works with wireless earpieces that use Bluetooth 2.0 technology.<br>  <br>  An agreement between Apple and Google provides for access to a specially modified version of Google Maps — in map, local list, or satellite form, optimized for the iPhone. During the product's announcement, Jobs demonstrated this feature by searching for nearby Starbucks locations and then placing a prank call to one with a single tap.[8] While the iPhone has no GPS support, the special Google Maps application does provide optional real-time traffic information.|`|AA11388730	you need a data plan with cingular. that's about it. when you activate your phone, all the iPhone data plans come with unlimited data.|`|yztIfagNaa	you can also use a wi-fi access point
XPWDnL8paa	So you can hold Blu-Ray movies. They require more GB's of space than DVD's. It really is unnecessary to have all of those GB's of space, because it's not all being used and too much. They should make them smaller so they can cut down on prices. Oh yea, HD-DVD all the way.|`|601a3f07e41234d1ab248ea1ea92a833aa	Because Blu-ray holds High Definition content. You can buy blank blu-ray disks and those you can put whatever you want on. They need lots of Gb's because the more stuff they can hold the better quality the movie can be. And to the guy above me: Blu-ray all the way. Holds more than that crappy HD-DVD garbage.|`|dee2aeeacdfd3b88a3a9ab76a5a72b92aa	You can once Blu Ray burners become available.  Plus as stated above, a high definition movie with uncompressed sound and extras can run upwards of 30-35 GBs.

There are no functions that require two hands, only two fingers (that's why it's called multitouch). If you don't know how to unlock the phone, read the instructions. All you have to do is slide your finger across the slider bar on the bottom. With one finger. @_@|`|AA11461005	well just use your right arm to operate it, you can do basically everything that any other person can do but it will require more effort on your part, i no because my friend has his right hand broken (and he uses his right hand for everything) and he is still able to use his new iPhone.... and no there isn't a handicapped version of the iphone you'll just have to deal, come to think of it is there even a "handicapped" iPhone?|`|47d244d62e953f06f3f23fd44440a3bcaa	Sorry about your situation, but I think theres really nothing you can do.|`|wIb7jJg8aa	sorry to hear but i think its just ur hand
LJtGKiG5aa	I think you need to take into consideration that maybe it's not the software that's being downloaded but it can also be your computer. It's probably trying to find space on your computer to place the software. I don't think it's possible to quickly download limewire you are going to have to be patient since it could be your computer.|`|Ysv5zPxDaa	i just went to limewire and clicked downloaded and i just did what it said
AA11388730	no problems yet, just wish it had certain features. No video camera, no multimedia messaging, no games, and no zoom on the camera. Still, I really love my phone. Sucha cool little gadget. Definitely worth the money considering how much fun I have with it and how jealous it makes my friends and family.|`|seboJEKOaa	I have one. But i don't like it. Cause the screen get really dirty and screwed up. So it's your choice though
AA11388730	check the chip itself and see if there is a switch or slider that can unlock it for you. If not, open the driver on your computer,  i.e. My computer and find the drive, right-click, choose properties and see if there is a box checked that says like READ-only or protect.
8w9LExLAaa	First, how much do you have left on your contract?  Verizon has a uprgade plan that if you compete your contract you can get a good deal a new phone.  If you have a lot left on your contract well, the next best hope is looking on Ebay.  There are several sellers that have new and used phones.  Sometimes you can get one buy it now price for less than half of new cost.  Make sure you check their seller reputation before you bid.  Also, you can use a post to want it now and tell exactly what you want and what you are willing to pay.  Then all sellers in Ebay can look at it.  Hope this helps.|`|AA11388730	I think your best bet is to buy it from ebay. I just checked right now and they have a lot of auctions and BUY IT NOW motorola SLVR L7's ranging from $127 (bid) - $240 (buy it now)|`|9bmAx4Sfaa	try searching ebay.com, craigslist.com, ioffer.com or amazon.com
ZiYhx17Waa	If you can find one $649.00 - contracts are $60-100 per month. iphones are selling on ebay from $699-$21 million!<br>  my advise, wait until they get the kinks worked out and then buy one. The phone will be better & the price will go down.|`|AA10173862	$499 and $599 depending on memory<br>  plus $60-$100 a month for service|`|AA11388730	The 8gb phone by itself was $648.42, or something close to that,  including tax.
df7012c88450b44c7b6bd778a13e9850aa	You cannot record videos or watch live tv on the iPhone.  And you also cannot buy anything on iTunes (movies/music) using your phone.  You need your computer to do that.<br>  <br>  And to add to what the person way above me said:  The phone will be locked with AT&T until 2009 and possibly even 2012.  So, it will not come out in one or two years with other carriers.  Another thing is that it will not work with fingernails, gloves, stylus' or anything else other than your finger.  Now you can hold down on the letter and then move around until you find the one you want to choose (my cousin found this easier).  But other than that, I do not think that it is too difficult to use the screen.  I have small fingers, but I am also very good at typing on a computer, so it is easy for me.  But my husband has big hands and he finds it okay.|`|09644ZZSaa	Think before you buy the iPhone, and make sure you are familiar with your carrier's return policy. Apple is notorious for its new products having battery life problems, and I'm not sure whether the iPhone features a removable battery but if its anything like the iPod its seamless and doesn't. The other red flag is that the iPhone is all touch controlled and the fact that it doesn't use a stylus concerns me. I've seen it demonstrated where the person does stuff through the menu but there's never more than one mp3 etc on the list. If you have dozens of mp3s and big fingers its gonna take several taps to select the right one. This might be easier for people with long fingernails. I'd probably wait a year or two by the time all the carriers have it it will be a better product. The first Razr phone had a crappy battery problem and much less features than it does now and it was released exclusively with cingular like the iPhone. The more carriers carrying it the more pressure the manufacturer has to make a better product in my opinion. I do work in the wireless phone business with several carriers (not including cingular/att unfortunately) so I haven't gotten to play with the iphone myself, but if the touch controls are as sensitive and annoying as those on the chocolate you might want to reconsider.|`|5VNNOibNaa	GO TO ITUNES.COM AND DOWNLOAD THE I PHONE  VIDEO IT WILL GIVE YOU ALL THE INFO YOU NEED TO KNOW|`|j5odb6Roaa	Q: Can the iPhone Record Videos<br>  A: No<br>  <br>  Q: Watch live TV<br>  A: No<br>  <br>  Q: Can you use iTunes on the iPhone?<br>  A: You can listen to music and watch videos, if that is what you're asking.<br>  <br>  It's probably one of the best phones out there, but it won't do the two things you asked about.

09644ZZSaa	Coolkid is right about the 1.3 megapixel camera however this only means that there are 1.3 million pixels in the photo not that the photos are as good quality as a 1.3 megapixel digital camera. They really aren't good enough to print. Good for viewing on the small screen. Depending on the phone though, they are generally somewhat grainy though on the computer at full size. I can always spot a picture taken with a phone.|`|KCPTwGLiaa	The kyocera cyclops has a 1.3 megapixel camera. Currently, this is the best Virgin Mobile offers. This camera will be good in resolution to print standard size 4x6 pictures. It will not be able print 8x10 with acceptable clarity. Overall, it is a decent camera overall, but good for the average cell phone.

Z5IxPHSgaa	i love verizon i can get service in the boondocks of alabama when visiting my sister.|`|09644ZZSaa	Verizon is better than at&t in general. The CDMA technology that Verizon uses is superior to AT&T's GSM technology although GSM will work in almost all countries and CDMA only works in a few, mainly the US. Verizon's customer service is much better than AT&T's overall and Verizon has a larger coverage area.
uw3J8M0waa	Even though I personally own this ultra compact camera, I would still like to highly recommend the purchase of a Nikon Coolpix L10 for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  1. Besides taking well-exposed hi-quality 5 megapixel pictures, it uses a standard set of rechargeable double AA batteries which last a very long time;<br>  2. Has a 3x optical zoom;<br>  3.  Takes "continuous" 2 frames per second "action/sports" images;<br>  4.  Has macro feature for close-ups of small objects focused under 6 inches;<br>  5. The flash setting for "red-eye" correction is on the navigator wheel and not within a submenu;<br>  6. It's very small and light;<br>  7. Uses inexpensive SD memory cards - a 2 gig card sells for $19 at samys.com;<br>  8. The digital video feature takes wonderful "sound" videos which are noise free. It records the piano very well with it's built-in microphone;<br>  9. It comes with a USB 2.0 transfer cable which you connect to your USB computer port;<br>  10. Has tripod mount on bottom of camera;<br>  11.

The problem is, the data features probably won't work on another network because data networks are vastly different from carrier to carrier so you'd probably only be able to call and text with it (no email or internet).

09644ZZSaa	Ok let me clear this up. Back in 2002-2003 there were two portions of AT&T: AT&T and AT&T Wireless Services Inc, a division of AT&T. AT&T sold their wireless division to Cingular (of which AT&T owned 60% and BellSouth owned the other 40%) in 2004 for 41 billion dollars. Now AT&T has bought Bell South for 67 billion which gives it 100% ownership of Cingular. This was a smart move on AT&T's part because they sold off something they were gonna get back for free anyway with their purchase of BellSouth.|`|ZvimUxr7aa	Nope...  AT&T changed the name of their wireless division to Cingular about three years ago and then changed it back just recently.  Same company.|`|dS5Gf1bTaa	It is weird how that company went through name changes.<br>  It originally WAS AT&T,then it became Cingular, and now it is back to AT&T...

When the Mobile Web is selected it will prompt you to choose from two options $5.00 a month (rebilling) for unlimited use or $1.00 for 24 hours of unlimited use (non-rebilling).|`|rYZqvYsHaa	that really depends on the details of your PLAN<br>  with Verizon
09644ZZSaa	There are two types of signals that your phone recieves: voice signals and data signals. 1x or EV displays your data signals. You will either have 1x with signal bars near it just like your voice signal bars, or you will have a 1x or EV that disappears when you don't have a data signal. If its not there you wont be able to transmit data (you can still text message, but no mobile web, ringtone downloads etc). You really don't want to remove this anymore you want to remove your signal strength indicator and you can't remove it anyway. As for what 1x and EV(DO) mean its just technical terms for the type of data network.

You can always get a 1 GB for now, and if you find yourself going on a long trip or needing to take more than 300 pics you can always get another card and swap them out when one is full.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Also get a card reader for transferring your pictures to the computer. Doing a USB transfer usually drains the camera's battery.|`|dLRNpeNgaa	Your memory card only holds 10MB?

6jwMte4zaa	just buy a sandisk e260 mp3 player. less problems does everything a ipod does and more and way cheaper
09644ZZSaa	If a mobile phone comes with a partial charge it should be fully discharged before the first charge. Most other devices come discharged. After this, it is recommended that to prolong battery life that the device is fully discharged once or twice every month.  It won't be devastating to the device if you don't do this every time you charge it, although avoid interrupting a charge (using device while charging or taking it off charge early) because this can decrease the battery life. I also don't recommend recharging the battery with any more than 1/4 charge left either.<br>  <br>  Beware also car chargers as many cars will discontinue the charge when the engine is shut off and this is no good.|`|LYaYPEbaaa	Probably the best thing to do when a battery is new is to fully charge it and then fully discharge it, then fully charge it again...this will "teach" the battery where its full charge is and will continue to charge fully the rest of the time

nay7AO3Daa	AT&T and Verizon both have business lines that they can forward to any number. But their 800/888 services are expensive
G8kMhYymaa	I think because your phone is not capable for transfering music... hands free and headset only allows you to connect to external wireless head phone, object push only allows you to transfer Business card or in other words contacts, I'm not sure about other data such as calender information, memo, to do list...etc, anyway object push is only for "small" data transfering not music... You need to have a file transfer service to receive or send music...|`|09644ZZSaa	The strobe doesn't support file transfer via bluetooth. Most phones nowadays only support the bluetooth profiles for connecting to an audio device (most mono, some stereo).
09644ZZSaa	Nothings free. I strongly suggest buying the music and supporting the artists you listen to. I'm sure you wouldn't like to work and not get paid. Anyway anywhere u get free mp3s you run a high risk of getting a virus.
nay7AO3Daa	The built in apps have a limited amount of buddies that will show up (40 to 150) depending on your phone.
nay7AO3Daa	Depends on your location. T-mobile blocks the service ports in certain areas so most likely it will not work well. Also there is a 900kb size limit
nay7AO3Daa	Full price is $349.99 for the phone (SK3). Its not worth it to get it at the store.<br>  <br>  Here is all you have to do:<br>  1. Buy a new/used SK3, SK2 or SKid on eBay or Craigslist. <br>  2. Get a prepaid T-mobile to go package OR call t-mobile and get the one for the SK data plan<br>  3. Call T-mobile and change the prepaid to SK prepaid.<br>  4. Activate SK no problems
nay7AO3Daa	Get a MicroSD memory card and load mp3s onto the card. Insert card into phone and the music will show up in your library.
nay7AO3Daa	Lets be clear. This is simple. There is NO UNLOCK CODE for the SK3s or SKids - t-mobile and danger do not give them out anymore, anyone who says they have one is lying. <br>  <br>  If you do manage somehow to get a magical unlocked one only text and voice will work. Nothing else will work. It requires network for most features and if you lose power all your data will be gone.
nay7AO3Daa	You need to get an updated SIM card. Insert SIM errors usually occur if the phone is locked and the SIM is from another carrier.

You can't put videos in any MP3...MP4 can.<br>  <br>  <br>  MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio encoding format.<br>  <br>  It uses a lossy compression algorithm that is designed to greatly reduce the amount of data required to represent the audio recording, yet still sound like a faithful reproduction of the original uncompressed audio to most listeners. It was invented at the University and the IIS institute of Erlangen, Germany by a team of European engineers of , Fraunhofer Society Germany, IRT, CCETT and Philips, who worked in the framework of the EUREKA 147 DAB digital radio research program, and it became an ISO/IEC standard in 1991.<br>  <br>  MP3 is an audio-specific format. The compression removes certain parts of sound that are outside the normal human hearing range so cannot be heard by the listener. It provides a representation of pulse-code modulation — encoded audio in much less space than straightforward methods, by using psychoacoustic models to discard components less audible to human hearing, and recording the remaining information in an efficient manner. Similar principles are used by JPEG, an image compression format.<br>  Contents<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope  this helped.
OhTPygYlaa	Of course the V3 has a USB port.  I should know, I have three of them.  As for how many mp3s it will hold, go to any ringtone or wallpaper in the media menu, press the menu bar "__" on top. Scroll to the bottom and select View Free Space.  If you have a number like 5335KB, write that as 5.335. Note the point instead of the comma.  Now divide that number by the average size of an mp3 (something like 3) and you got it. In that example, only one mp3 will fit on my old V3 with no flash card like the newer V3r.  Hope that helps.|`|4lTA8neuaa	I HAD THE V3 AND I HAD A NICE AMOUNT OF MP3 SONGS ON MY PHONE.

1f4ddf24416602d3d8a05d95f3c1c566aa	The lag/delay your experiencing may actually be a quick fix.  Essentially the game makers have already anticipated this problem. I have Guitar Hero 2/3 for the PS2, but I think the answer should be the same.<br>  <br>  If you go into the Menu Options for Guitar Hero (for the game not for the Wii) there should be an option for adjusting for this delay your experiencing. I think it should be under "Video Options" and then "Calibrate Lag" ... or something like that.  From there, follow the onscreen steps and you should be able to fix the problem.<br>  <br>  From that same "Video Settings" screen you should also have the option for the game to display in Widescreen properly.<br>  <br>  I have no idea why your Wammy Bar wouldn't be working because of this, however.  It may be a completely seperate issue, but try it again after doing the steps I listed above.<br>  <br>  The sensor bar "as far as I know" shouldn't have anything to do with it.  But if the batteries on the Wiimote are low then that could possibly be a factor.<br>  <br>  Also, the Wii doesn't actually do any sort of High Definition.. however they do sell Component Video Cables (Red, Green, Blue, White Red) for the Wii which will allow your HDTV to display most games in progressive (480p vs 480i) which should make games look a bit better. You'd need to set the Wii for "480p mode" in the Wii Setup Menu, as well.|`|bda49eb4c59cee3778478c994d41cedcaa	The sensor bar is probably the problem.

Unplug it if you want - it won't make a difference.  It's only used when you're pointing the remote at the TV.<br>  <br>  The batteries seem like a very unlikely cause.<br>  <br>  The calibration setting in the game might help.<br>  <br>  The whammy bar is probably a different issue.  If you are holding it down when you connect the remote to the guitar, it won't work.  Unplug the remote, then plug it back in and make sure you aren't holding the whammy bar down.  A lot of people set the guitar on the ground face-down to plug in the remote, which holds the whammy bar down and makes it inoperable.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|r0bLIkHHaa	Any chance you switched from 480i low def video output to Hi Def 720 or 1080??<br>  <br>  That requires MORE processing power....<br>  How about switching from RCA to HDMI?<br>  <br>  That can slow it down....<br>  <br>  Poor connections on the Guitar can wreak havoc, and if your Whammy Bar is totally dead....it WILL cause the Game to react slowly....<br>  <br>  The KEY is to start by setting up your Wii on your NEW TV <<JUST LIKE>> you had it on your 27 inch TV set.....<br>  <br>  Yeah, the OLD Video cables have to come out and be connected up.....<br>  <br>  Then check the speed....if it's still slow, I'd be looking at the Guitar....<br>  IF IT'S Wireless.....GET NEW BATTERIES...<br>  <br>  Sorry, I don't play the Wii....but I have stayed at a Holiday Inn.....

But don`t be scared, it is possible to unlock it. <br>  To unlock a k800i take it to a Vodafone center and ask them nicely, but they might refuse. If so, take your phone to a cell-phone repair shop, they will do it for you (for a fee, of course).<br>  The bad thing is that you will lose your warranty.

To 'unlock' a mobile phone means to enable its use on any network. Over here in the UK, MSPs (Mobile Service Providers) will 'lock' the phones they sell/give away as part of a contract, so that the phone can only be used on their network, and not another. <br>  <br>  But there are places that will, for a fee, 'deactivate' the 'lock' so the user can put another MSP's SIM card in it and use it on another network.<br>  <br>  Sorry, to hijack your question (to which I don't know the answer, I'm afraid - have you tried Googling for unlocking shops near you...?) but I felt that, for the benefit of our American 'viewers', an explanation of the term was in order, just so they know what we're banging on about!<br>  <br>  Sorry! xxx|`|4YEIalf0aa	im not sure how it is in ireland but in u.s.a. if u dont know ur code there is no way to open it.<br>  if u didnt change it it should be ur last 4 digits of ur phone number.. at least in america|`|AA12180617	if going from UK to northern ireland  don;t bother!<br>  Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK and your phone will work on existing networks.<br>  <br>  unlocking a phone CAN render it useless on any network!  many dealer can do this but need special equipment to access the phones NVRAM to do this properly its not going to work by entering a code into the keypad for most phones!|`|1eCY0lQ3aa	Go to one of those phones accessories shops on the High Street or to the phone stalls at your local market.

Ltco7mZcaa	Dude first of all gamestop buy's broken products because I sold them a broken gamecube. Anyways ok for the ps2 I would say like 10 or 15 bucks. The slim you will get like 45 bucks.

The new one would probably get around 20-65 dollars. I highly doubt 65 though. Trust me it's not much. I got 35 for my old one.|`|Og11BohDaa	You won't get squat for the broken one.  They won't be able to re-sell it and they aren't going to put the time and money into fixing it when they won't be able to re-sell it then.  Most gamestop stores have an overstock of used pS2s right now.  <br>  <br>  Like the others said: you won't get over $30 for the slim one.  I bought one with two controllers and Sims: Castaway for under $100 two months ago.<br>  <br>  You'll get more if you trade it in for store credit.  You can try selling it on your local craigslist.  I sell on mine regularly and usually get more from independent buyers than I would resell shops.|`|rkX1PtV7aa	Gamestop wont give you what your ps2 is really worth...you wont get nothing for the broken ps2...but you might get $35 for the slim one maybe less or maybe more (but not much more) it depends on the condition of the ps2 (scuffs or scratches stuff like that). If it was open and there is no seal they will not take it. If you trade it in for store credit you'll get a little more for it. anyways check this site out...<a href="http://www.freewebs.com/justamessenger" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/justamessenger</a>|`|4YEIalf0aa	they rip u off  but u should go and ask because they told me 40 dollars but it might have changed<br>  i recommend u sell the ps2 that works on ebay because u will definitely get more money.
mFn6LNnDaa	Question:<br>  What is a SIM card?<br>  What is the purpose of a SIM card?<br>  <br>  Answer:<br>  A SIM card is a specially programmed microchip that inserts into a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)-compatible mobile device. The SIM card encrypts transmissions and identifies the user to the mobile network. Without a SIM card inserted into the mobile equipment only emergency calls to 911 can be made.<br>  <br>  SIM cards allow users to easily switch their account information between other compatible GSM devices for immediate use. SIM cards also act as a removable storage device within the mobile equipment. SIM cards contain up to 128 KB of available memory for storing contact names and phone numbers as well as text messages. This allows for users to easily update their new mobile device with the phone book.|`|vSj6v1Zwaa	SIM stands for "Subscriber Identification Module"<br>  SIM cards are small smart cards that fit inside phones based on the GSM technology. SIMs contain personalized information about its user including the network activation and even phone book entries. One can put its SIM card in another GSM phone and use it as if it was his own phone.|`|c097660a2776366a85a5a46a4400f8b1aa	wireless providers like AT&T and tmobile use SIM cards to identify specific phones. they are basically small little plastic things behind the batteries, and the sim cards are pretty much the keys to a cell phone like keys to a car. Without the sim card, the only thing that phone will do is dial 911 or whatever. you can also swap your phone whenever you want by just changing the sim card.<br>  <br>  verizon and sprint don't use sim cards, they implant the phone data into the phone, so swapping phones is not as easy.|`|pvlH2n7Aaa	A Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) is part of a removable smart card ICC (Integrated Circuit Card), also known as SIM Cards, for mobile, telephony devices (such as computers) and mobile phones. SIM cards securely store the service-subscriber key (IMSI) used to identify a subscriber. The SIM card allows users to change phones by simply removing the SIM card from one mobile phone and inserting it into another mobile phone or broadband telephony device.<br>  <br>  SIM cards are available in two standard sizes. The first is the size of a credit card (85.60 mm × 53.98 mm x 0.76 mm). The newer, more popular miniature-version has a width of 25 mm, a height of 15 mm, and a thickness of 0.76 mm. However most SIM cards are supplied as a full-sized card with the smaller card held in place by a few plastic links and can be easily broken off to be used in a phone that uses the smaller SIM.<br>  <br>  The first SIM Card was made in 1991, with Munich smart card maker Giesecke & Devrient selling the first 300 SIM cards to Finnish wireless network operator Elisa Oyj (formerly Radiolinja).<br>  <br>  W-SIM is a SIM card which also integrates core cellular technology into the card itself.|`|t14AFGLXaa	a SIM card is a little tiny card that goes into the back of your cell phone. the SIM card holds your number. When you pop it into a cell phone, people are able to call you and you are able to call them. Without it, your basically just have a useless phone htat doesn't work.|`|Dz9dwqq5aa	A SIM card is a small memory card with your phone information on. Your phone number also.<br>  You can also save phone numbers to it.<br>  That's the basic description.<br>  I hope this answers your question.

Plus the premium comes with the component cables, the headset, the ethernet cable, the entire works. It's worth the extra $80. <br>  <br>  If you really can, go for an elite, because that 120gb HDD will serve you for years.|`|Szc72VAkaa	do not get the arcade. it has no memory. and dont get the elite either. it has too much memory(even though it looks a lot cooler) . my brother has the normal xbox360 and he still didnt fill it up yet.|`|FNmF4bOgaa	Get the premium!<br>  <br>  Arcade doesn't have harddrive and you can't go online!|`|scPlepXraa	You will be able to save a game or 2 but not much<br>  <br>  but if you have the hard drive you can dowload demos songs videos and xbox live<br>  <br>  Get the Pro

r8HAHhgkaa	well the pro is that you will get it for cheaper. it may even come with games or extra controllers already. the downside is the same with any used thing. it might have problmes and it might be an older 360. find out if it was made before 2007 because the ones before that are ticking time bombs. it isnt a matter of when they will get the RROD but when. RROD is the red rings of death that make the 360 useless in case you dont know|`|nB3JH2Wjaa	Pros: Cheap, additional components<br>  Cons: No warranty, could be faulty, wear and tear,|`|lvzDVeVpaa	Cons: it's used which means it does have some wear and tear on it.<br>  <br>  pros:it's cheaper than buying new.<br>  <br>  i would suggest getting a new one because there is a chance the used one is defective. however if money is a issue then by all means gamble on a used one worse case scenario you take it back saying it didn't work.|`|c097660a2776366a85a5a46a4400f8b1aa	There are no pros. The savings you will get are so small, you might as well go to target, buy one new, sign up for a redcard, and save 10%. <br>  <br>  WHY IS USED BAD? because people returned them for a reason... most likely hardware failure. Plus from personal experience, used/refurbished xbox have no warranty with microsoft.

DXtyMRLuaa	I dont have an Iriver but I love my ipod.|`|UqYoQ3hSaa	Ive never heard of Iriver but if its cheaper and has more features then it sounds like a better deal. |`|6WFIXIWfaa	iriver is way better than any Apple product.  I own an iriver Clix and the sound quality is better than my iPod Touch.  It actually isn't always cheaper and it does have many more features.  You may also want to consider brands like Cowon and Archos.  The headphones will not be any good with iriver, so you should go out and buy some good ones.  I have V-Moda Bass Freq.'s, and they are pretty good.  I say get the iriver.
6WFIXIWfaa	3200 watts is a lot.  Most electronic companies, like Sony and Samsung max out at about 1000 watts.Bose is known for their high-quality sound, so, yeah, it will be good.  Keep in mind, there are other good brands, like JBL, KEF, Klipsch, Onkyo, etc.  I have a Harman/ Kardon home theatre system, and it is great, but lacks power.  Though I have never owned a Bose product, I am pretty sure that you will be satisfied, except with their earbuds (so I've heard).  Good luck.|`|ofpmRvHpaa	No.<br>  <br>  That power rating is over-inflated and Bose is rather over-priced for what you get for the money.<br>  <br>  Try to find a review of the Bose system you are talking about.  See if any of the sites that measure actual power from Yamaha, Sony, Denon receivers agree with the power numbers for the Bose system.<br>  <br>  Power numbers - are easy to lie about because there are details in the fine print.<br>  <br>  Example: I know of a Yugo that hit 85 miles per hour. (Fine print: "When being carried on a carrier.")<br>  <br>  To understand power numbers - you have to read how it was measured:<br>  <br>  - 2 channel measurements do not tell you what you get with 5 channels<br>  - Peak is a lot bigger number than RMS<br>  - 2 or 4 ohm speakers make the power numbers look larger than the more standard 8 ohms<br>  <br>

This is because they are much brighter and the bulbs are closer together, giving a more fluid motion.  For LCDs, this problem can be solved by a technology called 120hz, allowing the frame rate to be doubled.  LCDs are meant for brighter rooms because they have a wider viewing angle, where as plasmas aren't as good.  People have said that LCDs last longer than plasmas, though plasma developers are improving their product's lifespan.  Plasmas are susceptible to pattern burns from video games and stationary channels, though this is also improving.  I personally prefer to have LCDs with the 120Hz feature because of the more casual atmosphere of my house.  I hope this helped.  Good luck. |`|fbcc228ab5337707afa4980cbe4aced6aa	i would say plasma gives u a better picture...in the ldc....it looks good but can reflect light off....like from the sun or watever....and plasma doesnt but it looks more fragile if u touch it and keep it clean|`|PhqFcNBRaa	it depends on want your looking for I would get a plasma|`|DieGzBtLaa	plasma or lcd
848c3c596d821d8f27c64a25f1db134eaa	You should always go for the Sony products.They are a far better make than LG.I always go for Sony.Ive now had my Sony Bravia for 2 and a half years and it is still as good as new.Ive got a mate who has a Lg and the picture quality is no where near as good as my Sony Bravia|`|01K2QAydaa	i get the LG it has bluetooth |`|6WFIXIWfaa	Sony products are good, but they are usually overpriced.  People have told me that Samsung is the best brand there is for LCD TVs, so, normally, I would tell you to get that one.  However, your selected LG TVs have a technology called 100Hz (in PAL countries; 120Hz in NTSC countries).  This will provide a clearer picture, with more fluid motion (similar to plasmas).  This also allows for Blu-Ray players to have a clearer picture on your TV (known as 24p in NTSC; don't know about PAL).  If you can get a Samsung TV with 100Hz, that is your best option.  Good luck.

You could try Desktop Manager and see if you can back up your info through that program. |`|lw3eTJoXaa	Have the store transfer your contacts for you.  If  your bringing both phones home you can plug them both in via two usb cables (at the same time) and a utility on the disc that comes with the curve will automatically transfer your contacts from windows mobile to your curve.  Also transfers your calendar appointments and such.  From there the desktop blackberry manager can create a backup of all the stuff on your phone on your computer.  Make sure you install the disc's software without either phone plugged in won't install with it plugged in. After that it's a piece of cake.

Then it should show up in your email.  |`|TjhqvQTjaa	yeah, you can send the pictures to your email address and save them from there|`|SP0sMeoYaa	email it to yourself<br>  |`|rYltDL61aa	send the picture to your email |`|MHg9JhEKaa	You can only blurtooth it if you computer has the relevant softwear. Other than that you need a USB cable, which plugs into your computer and phone. If you don't have one, watch when shopping that you get the correct one for your make/model of phone. The cables are not generic. Once they're connected, normally an automatic pop up box on the computer will guide you through the steps, and you can save the picture to your chosen computer file. <br>  <br>  You can also email the from your phone, if you have registered your phone/email address, and have fixed the relevant settings.  <br>  <br>   |`|AA10333093	Bluetooth is good for for transferring pix from your cell to your PC if they both have Bluetooth.  If so, go to your phone's Bluetooth menu and it will "talk" you through.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you'll need a cable that has a USB connector on one end and a special plug (specific to your brand of phone) on the other end.  You can find these cables on eBay for about $6.<br>  <br>  You will have to go the the website of your phone manufacture and download a pix-transfer program to your PC.  The program will take you step-by-step through the process.  It is usually VERY easy.<br>  |`|c751fbc25b64e2d55123a16ac0df41b8aa	A bluetooth dongle will allow the transfer, so would the Usb cable that came with the phone, If you can still find it<br>  <br>  edit - No cable.. right thats what I get for not reading properly<br>  <br>  A bluetooth dongle is a usb attachment that will give your pc or laptop a bluetooth contection, begin able to send and recieve files from your phone|`|e6c4cabc9282372e5f9f3886c24b4942aa	send the pictures by email|`|AA10293793	just send the pics to your email address (like a text)
DR4w8QNZaa	you should provide more info.... is it an S-video cord? or a firewire?<br>  there is probably something wrong with the input settings in movie maker....you usually have to specify the origin of the video...make sure the camera is turned on and in play mode<br>  <br>  from personal experience... a firewire is the best, quickest way to transfer video.....<br>  <br>  the quality is also much better than through a movie box or usb....<br>  <br>  and you don't have to render it.... :D<br>  <br>  firewire = 40 dollars<br>  <br>  most new computers already come with a firewire input...|`|d1az21claa	I can,tget it to work|`|UGAr0M3laa	maybe the cord u are using doesnt work if it doesnt get a new one
gjyLQs0Zaa	As opposed to the other users here, I actually own GH:WT. The song creator is a thoroughly worthless feature, so ignore it completely. Also the instruments for WT are breaking left and right just like RB1, so ignore that too (although mine were fine). It's really all about your personal preferences. If you like hard/challenging charts, get GH:WT. If you like accurate/realistic charts, get RB2.<br>  <br>  Do not get RB1, at least not the instrument bundle. The issues with the drum kit are the stuff of legend. It's not just the kick pedal. Double hitting and crosstalk are rampant, and compensating for them requires tinkering and willingness to void the warranty. Most of these issues were fixed with RB2.|`|HXahRFKEaa	World Tour.  It has a song creator so you can make your own songs.|`|hqDLUwvyaa	GH:World Your cause Rockband kinda has about 5-7 sames songs and the drums have malfunctions|`|nCfarFc7aa	GH:World Your cause Rockband kinda has about 5-7 sames songs and the drums have malfunctions|`|EW7kRrWxaa	wtf rockband 4-6 same songs? and drums broke? first rockband the only thing wrong was the pedal but rockband 2 drums was disign not to break like first one<br>  <br>  but i still gottta go with gh has its song crater 
HXahRFKEaa	If you want to save disc games onto your 360, wait until November 19th when the NXE (New Xbox Experience) comes out. It's a mandatory system software that will let people save disc games to their hard drives.  It's 100% free.  Don't waist your money.  It'll be awsome.  I suggest the system that has a 60gb hard drive for this, because the games will take up 6-10gb.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|sxrFZ8uSaa	This looks like a good site but I dont know for sure.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.modchipstore.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.modchipstore.com/</a><br>  <br>  You might just want to get someone to mod it for you because it will be a huge hassle to do it yourself unless you know what youre doing or are into that kind of stuff, and if anythinf search on ebay.com and they will have some seller who will be willing to mod your xbox<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck
nuuy0EkCaa	I heard if you register your console, your eligible.<br>  <br>  Or you could ask around until you find someone who has the beta and use theirs.|`|pOi0wewIaa	1. Download the Home theme from PSN store<br>  or<br>  2. Buy the Qore episode|`|kXlQNegGaa	Looks like it's going to be random invites from here on out until release which is still unknown.  Just recently it was those who subscribed anually to Qore.

He was using the 1394 firewire port and downloading recorded shows on to his MAC computer. I honestly don't know if the USB ports on the DVR work, but it doesn't hurt to give it a try.
a7e39856faa19cab08a9b58b0f4cca89aa	Gears of War 2, bro|`|G8Po13Uaaa	Here is a list of some great games that I would recommend:<br>  <br>  Call of Duty 4<br>  Bioshock<br>  Assassins Creed<br>  Oblivion<br>  Condemned 2: Bloodshot<br>  Fallout 3<br>  Fable 2<br>  Rockband 2<br>  Grand Theft Auto 4<br>  Grid<br>  Burnout Paradise<br>  Call of Duty World at War (even though I like COD4 better)<br>  <br>  and there are tons more games out there that are good and that is coming out.<br>  <br>  And I wont mention getting Gears 2 since you are getting it free, but that is the best game out there right now.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|IHnKZeLUaa	FALLOUT 3<br>  <br>  TRUST ME<br>  |`|OeylJNlNaa	I think Fable 2 is one of the best games on the 360 right now. I'd say fable 2. If you want a racing game, Definitely go for Midnight Club LA. Though Undercover looks good too but I think Midnight Club is a better game series all around. If you want an action game, go for Ninja Gaiden 2 unless you get mad at games easy. lol Devil May Cry 4 is a really good action game and not too difficult on the easier settings. |`|HXahRFKEaa	Burnout: Paradise is awsome.  I haven't tried Midnight Club: L.A. yet, but it got good ratings & looks beutiful.  (8.5/10 on IGN).  Undercover doesn't have a rating yet, but the press average is 8.0/10.  I would go with Midnight Club, It looks great & I read there's a LOT of customization & the remake of L.A. is beutiful, plus you can drive all over the city & run people over! (lol)|`|3tMC3FXkaa	If you want a racing game, go for Burnout Paradise. It's around a year old, but it's really good, especially with the patches that came out. I also recommend Saints Row 2, Fable 2, or EndWar.
