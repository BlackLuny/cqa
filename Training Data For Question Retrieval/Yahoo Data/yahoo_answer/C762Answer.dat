hn2LgMB1aa	Sim é um vício... mas chocolate n?o faz tanto mal à saúde, pelo contrário dependendo do tipo de chocolate q vc come traz mtos benefícios - protege o cora??o, o sistema nervoso e ainda alivia a TPM - Logo n?o tem pq se preocupar, já q vc gosta tanto e ele faz bem.<br>  <br>  Fuja apenas dos chocolates que abusam da gordura hidrogenada para substituir o cacau confira as propor??es no rótulo. E prefira consumir o chocolate logo após as refei??es (depois do almo?o, por exemplo) por se tratar de um alimento de alto índice glicêmico.|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	vicio é sim.. mas fala q num é bom.???? rsrsrs<br>  beijoooooooooo|`|88d7170d5dbb8a22749a9af04056231baa	VICIADA SIM!!|`|6AsQg46Haa	Eu também era, até comer o da marca (Lindt) chocolate suí?o, depois dele descobri que nenhum chocolate vale a pena, eu como as vezes o ferrero, mas como é muito caro n?o como muito, e o Lindt, nem se fala é mais caro ainda! Só de lembrar da água na boca! Como n?o tenho, prefiro ficar sem comer nada.

O fator que determina o comportamento humano s?o as emo??es; se a pessoa se manter emocionalmente bem, n?o cairá no vício. N?o existe ninguém que se mantenha equilibrado permanentemente. A fragilidade emocional do homem pode torná-la compulsiva e ansiosa. O humano compulsivo toma uma decis?o determinada n?o tendo controle da situa??o, mas com consciência daquilo que faz. Todo vício é controlado quando a pessoas tem consciência de que é viciada, busca um processo de auto conhecimento, trabalhando a sua ansiedade. Descobrir o porque da paix?o das pessoas por chocolate é fácil! Afinal ele melhora o humor das pessoas!! Isso acontece porque o chocolate estimula a produ??o de serotonina (substancia do cérebro que melhora o humor das pessoas) e evita a oxida??o e a deteriora??o das células. Muitas pessoas em estado de depress?o recorrem ao chocolate para se acalmar. Tem gente que, quanto mais nervosa e mais ansiosa, mais consome chocolate.O problema maior acontece com os chocólatras obesos, já que muitos entram em depress?o quando têm que restringir completamente o chocolate de sua dieta. Para evitar que o chocólatra venha a n?o aderir a dieta, alguns nutricionista se vêem obrigados a incluir algumas por??es de chocolate. Há pessoas que sofrem de sugar craving (compuls?o por a?úcar) apresentam um déficit de serotonina o que impede a sensa??o de calma e estabilidade de humor, indispensáveis às células cerebrais. O tratamento é feito através de um medicamento que eleva o nível de serotonina no cérebro, dando uma sensa??o de saciedade. O médico lembra que os "ataques" dos chocólatras costumam ocorrer à noite, quando s?o comuns as crises de depress?o. Há também quem culpe a teobromina, substancia do cacau, como a responsável pela "atra??o fatal" exercida pelo chocolate, e quem aponte a feniletamina, a mesma substancia que o cérebro libera quando a pessoa está apaixonada. Sobre o desejo incontrolável por chocolate que algumas mulheres sentem no período pré-menstrual, especialistas afirmam que a causa está relacionada às altera??es no nível de horm?nios, uma vez que deprimida, a mulher sente vontade de ingerir alimentos com alto teor de gordura.|`|d1frsgrLaa	simmm , tudo em exessivo e um vicio desde compras a drogas , inclui comida neste meio .

And I would introduce him to the rats I am going to get!<br>  <br>  I don't think I'll do cruel stuff to him.  I would let him swim in my water glasses.  I'd make him a mini table and chair, set him on my table, and then let him eat food like ONE BITE of a bite-sized carrot stick, one piece of corn, one microscopic spoonful of mashed potatoes, and one slice of steak.<br>  <br>  I would have him draw a picture of himself, draw his silhouette, and have him french braid/braid my hair.<br>  <br>  That's good friend, now mean.<br>  <br>  I would crush his toes with my feet, push him with one finger, call him Shortie-Sir-3-Inch,  rip off his buttons, and yeah that's all I can think of.<br>  <br>  In love I would get him one chocolate heart candy, cherry-filled, and give it t him.  But I would cut a piece out and put cloth/wood in it so he could sit down and tell him to chew around him when he is eating.  I would make him tiny shirts, let him sleep in my pockets, and give him normal sized teddy bears, or even life-size, so he has a giant teddy bear.  I would make him furniture and hug him with my fingers.<br>  <br>  I'd take him, not kidnap because I would treat him well unless I was the mean one . . .

ZB0393Kkaa	Equal in calories.<br>  <br>  If you're really calorie conscious, don't drink mixed drinks as they are typically loaded with sugar. The calories from the alcohol are not stored or used efficiently, so drinking either wine or spirits is your best option if you're calorie conscious. Beer isn't bad either (though some brews have quite a few carbs).|`|lWnHa1jtaa	equal. When something freezes, it's just the molecules condensing.|`|4coUbchGaa	Like almost all good questions .... it depends.<br>  <br>  Both should have the same ingredients but with an addition of ice, making them the same in terms of calories.....<br>  <br>  BUT, most of the people who drink frozen margaritas like them sweeter because they are not used to the taste of alcohol.  Producers of Frozen Margaritas (myself included) know this so add more sugar, making the Frozen Margarita higher in calories.

Just exercise more, eat fruits and veggies and water, and be healthy.|`|3inOJA89aa	if you eat 3 meals a day ans 3 snacks watching portions and eating whole wheat breads and lean meats and drink water (not too much or you will get poisoned) 8 glasses a day at least, just try not to eat sugar, and do some exercises, in about a month you'l oose 10 pounds , the thing is that you need to eat so your metabolism will burn calories faster if you dont eat your body thinks you are starving it therefore your metaboism slows down, so pick and choose your snaks if you have any questions ask your doctor!!|`|AA10138626	Through diet and exercise it is typical to only lose one pound or none at all in the first week. After that its healthy to lose about one or two pounds a week, so at that rate it might take you about two months to lose 10 pounds.|`|EGYTMhvAaa	You can loose 10lbs in a month,but you  need to burn more off more each day than you take in. 3500 calories equals a pound. A month would be the soonest and certainly 2 months is even more realistic if you do not exercise.<br>  <br>  *** Do not skip meals or starve yourse lf. It can backfire and your body will try and hold any fat you have.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of water (at least 64oz a day)<br>  Portion Control and 1500 calories would be good<br>  Exercise and move.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|6HGhXZscaa	when u are a teenager it is hard to lose weight unless you are obesse because your body is growing constantly.|`|7xbSG3lQaa	I know a girl about your size who is 108, so losing ten pounds isn't an abnormal goal. I would be very careful though, a lot of "diet tips" can be fatal for someone of your size. For example, you should not take a lot of caffeine. <br>  <br>  I would aim for a pound a month to be safe.

CTPFrR0Paa	The fungicide's purpose is to reduce the likelihood of rotting/decay.<br>  <br>  U.S. Food and Drug Administration has shown that approved waxes are safe to eat. As they are indigestible; they will go through the body without breaking down or being absorbed. Waxes cannot be removed by washing. If consumers prefer not to consume waxes, they can always peel the fruit or vegetables, or alternatively, scrub or scrape the wax off the surface of the produce just before eating. <br>  <br>  Here's a cheap food scrubber:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Formulations-Fruit-and-Veggie-Scrubber/dp/B001BVUH7S" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Formulations-Fruit...</a>|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Immediately after fungicide treatment, a water based wax emulsion is applied to protect fruit from water loss and improve appearance.

If it's a chunk of Parmesan then just scrape off the mold but if it's already grated you should toss it.|`|eh3UhLX4aa	Parmesan cheese is an aged cheese and therefore it ages well.  Grated cheese is another matter, particularly if it's in the green and yellow box -- which is maybe not even parmesan cheese in the first place.  It will last long after its expiration (perhaps decades) but the flavor will be completely GONE.  Much better to buy it by the chunk, grating your own as needed, and wrapping unused portion in butcher paper (NOT saran or other clingy wraps as the cheese can't breathe) and refrigerating.|`|h3IjAuCgaa	When it comes to the best way to store Parmesan, that depends on how you will be using it and how often you will be needing it.<br>  <br>  In general, the best place to store shredded or grated hard cheese (such as Parmesan, Asiago, Gruyere, Jarlsberg or Swiss) is in your freezer, not the refrigerator. The California Milk Advisory Board suggests wrapping the cheese tightly in an air-tight, moisture-proof wrapper to prevent evaporation, then to freeze it quickly at 0 degrees F or below. You can keep it in your freezer for up to three months! Let the frozen cheese thaw in the refrigerator for 24 hours and then serve as soon as possible.<br>  <br>  Amazon.com<br>  <br>  Oxo Good Grips Box Grate...Oxo Good Grips Box Grater<br>  Best $13.94<br>  Privacy Information<br>  If you would prefer to store the Parmesan cheese in your refrigerator because you plan to use it often, keep it wrapped loosely or in a plastic container. The cheese needs to "breathe," and if you wrap it tightly, you may cause the oil to separate out or the cheese to get moldy. And, very importantly, store it in the warmest areas of your refrigerator -- which usually means the door or the bottom of the vegetable drawers (crisper).<br>  <br>  Finally, even if the cheese does get some mold, all is not lost. In most cases, you can trim off the mold and another 1/2 inch below the moldy portion and use the remainder of the cheese.|`|fkX0TiYVaa	The "best if used by" date is intended to tell you how long the product will retain best flavor or quality. The term is not a safety date. "Best if used by" dates are intended as useful guidelines. Some foods may deteriorate more quickly and other foods may last longer than the times suggested. A number of factors can shorten the useful life of a food product, such as improper handling and inadequate storage. Food products may be consumed after the "best if used by" date if the product has been properly stored and handled. <br>  <br>  If in dough throw it out!|`|F9Mrquc5aa	honestly if you keep it in an airtight container it will last you a very long time. that is the beauty of a dry hard cheese like Parmesan the flavour will improve with time. if you see green and white hairs ie mold pitch it. <br>  <br>  but otherwise enjoy.|`|94d29768069e88f4fb9876e92edbcc5caa	You will notice the experation date on dairy products will useually say "Best Before", it means just that. With grated cheeses you can use them untill they go moldy so look carefully and give it a smell just to be careful. Next time keep it in the freezer, it'll last way longer and grated cheese defrosts super fast.

The Nutrient Label will have the sugar content per serving, vitamins, salt, and any concentrate fruit juice.

fh8bQdGkaa	what? that's not going to make you sick. strange combo's are sometimes awesome when you're hungry. do you have ranch sauce, mayo or sour cream? you may want to make a base sauce for it first.

Also, I don't know what kind of salad you have there, but mix that up into the sauce as well. if you have mayo, serve the concoction cold, but heat the fried dumplings obviously. don't put so much of the base sauce that it drowns your dumplings either. just use your head, think about what would be a good combo, and try it out. good luck, hope it turns out great.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Eat what you please, you only live once.|`|8XqD6xSCaa	haha nice combo :)<br>  <br>  nothing to worry about. <br>  <br>  example you could eat your fried dumplings now and eat tomato pasta an hour later then salad in the next hour but you dont get ill.<br>  <br>  you just short cutting but having it all at once the only side affect you could get their is a stange taste lol

It's been 18 in England and the rest of Europe for ages and I don't think it causes any more problems than it would if it was at 21. I know England has problems with binge drinking, but i think that has more to do with culture and lack of education than it does to do with the drinking age itself. Also, if you can have a job, enlist to be in the military, start a family and drive a car then surely you should be able to drink. In my view if you're old enough to pay taxes you're old enough to decide what's best for you.|`|lv5na6j2aa	When your 18 years old you are considered an adult. You can vote, be drafted, and drive. You also have a lot of responsibilities.  If eighteen year old teenagers are responsible and mature then why can’t they buy alcohol? People say eighteen year olds can’t handle alcohol, because they make to many mistakes. If you start to drink at eighteen or twenty one your tolerance is still going to be the same. Meaning, that no matter what age you start to drink you don’t know how much you can handle until you start drinking. So when people say eighteen year olds make too many mistakes when they drink it’s only because they started drinking, just as a twenty one year old will make mistakes when he starts to drink. Also society uses young teenagers as scapegoats for alcohol problems when really it doesn’t matter if your 17, 21 or 38 years of age. Alcohol is still a serious problem among all people. It does not go away when you become 21 years of age. This is an example of how eighteen year olds are portrayed as apposed to twenty one year olds. <br>  <br>               It is a know fact that a lot of teenagers drink regardless of the drinking age. Either at home, parties, or just in hangs out places. Therefore, people make the argument that because teenagers can get to alcohol, if we lower the drinking age then twelve and thirteen year old kids will also be able to access alcohol even easier and start drinking at a even younger age, but that is not the case at all, because even now 71 % of eight graders say it is fairly easy for them to get alcohol. So it wouldn’t even make a difference if the age was lowered. That is another issue that people argue and are wrong on. Now one of the most important reasons why society feels 18 year olds shouldn’t be aloud to drink is because they are not mature enough. Well, if that is the case then why can they be mature and responsible enough to vote for a person who is going to run our country, mature and responsible enough to fly an airplane and go to war for our country, and third be mature and responsible enough to drive a vehicle which is a cause of many injuries and deaths in today’s world. If they can be mature enough for all those things what makes alcohol so special. People like to say because you can make more mistakes with alcohol then those things. But like I said before it doesn’t matter what age you are when you first start to drink you are going to make mistakes it is part of the learning process. <br>  <br>               My next argument is going to be that I feel there shouldn’t even be a drinking age. If there was no drinking age kids would not think as alcohol as the forbidden fruit anymore and be more responsible with it. “The flaunting of the current age-specific prohibition is readily apparent among young people who, since the increase in the minimum legal drinking age, have tended to drink in a more abuse manner than do those of legal age”.  This quote is saying that because the drinking age is 21 when younger adults get their hands on alcohol they tend to drink a lot more because they don’t know when they will be able to get alcohol again. It is a known fact that since the drinking age has become 21 years of age the percentage of younger people drinking has dropped, but the amount of alcohol consumed by a teenager has gone up. “Lowering the drinking age would help send the important message that drinking is, in itself, not evidence of maturity…..that responsible consumption for those who choose to drink is evidence of maturity.”  In today’s world alcohol is always going to be a problem no matter what age. But having the drinking age at 21 can be a bad idea. It makes teenagers go crazy when they get their hands on alcohol not teaching them the maturity you have to have when you drink. If the drinking age becomes lowered it will help kids from the ages 12 to 18 realize how important alcohol is and how mature we must become when we are under the influence of alcohol.<br>  |`|qolXMvWWaa	From a moral stand-point, yes. If you can join the military, marry, vote, etc. then you should be able to drink.<br>  <br>  From a health stand-point, no. The human body stops maturing around the age of 25 and to limit the damage alcohol can do to you the drinking age should actually be higher.|`|fROWmQCbaa	yea and no for many good reasons. one if we can be shipped overseas to fight for this country we should be allowed to enjoy a good beer. two, many many many children can get ahold of alcohol way too easily. on my 15th birthday i went out to dinner with some friends and the BAR ITSELF sent us over  some alcoholic drinks and we had to send them back because we were underage. i know people from highschool and jr high who came to peprallies drunk off their asses. lower it to 18 to enjoy the privledge but not to let kids loose. |`|1a11d3b9550d5e86e7678c152b71a041aa	Only for those serving their country, otherwise Id say no because most 21 year olds dont know how to drink responsibly. |`|i6pshiLoaa	Move to Canada!|`|YxsarCjQaa	No. |`|jQH0Y56Uaa	YESSS|`|qPlbNOB0aa	YES!!|`|ZLq4U7MIaa	it really doesn't make a difference....kids always find a way to drink anyway|`|u6pgaMdVaa	no|`|2HyVuI86aa	why dont ppl start feeding their babies alcohol huh?<br>  give em a good start?<br>  |`|rBqxJwQyaa	YES if you can die for your country then you should be able to have a beer in a bar

TJOHxhEUaa	Not usually.  Here's a paragraph from Wikipedia:<br>  <br>  Pinto beans are commonly used as chili beans, as are black-eyed peas, kidney beans, great northern beans, or navy beans.

The name may have arisen from that bean's resemblance to small chili peppers, or it may be a reference to that bean's inclusion in chili recipes.<br>  <br>  But use whatever beans you like in chili, or whatever you have on hand, and it'll be fine.

I used to make chili with canned red kidney beans, but a 3 bean chili with kidney beans, pinto beans, and black beans is delicious, too. You can use the canned beans, or use dried beans, which you have to soak and cook separately before you add them to the chili. You might think you could just cook them with the chili, but the acid in the tomato will slow down the cooking of the beans, so if you do use dried beans, cook them separately with just water and salt, then add them to the chili just before it's done.|`|wG2AbAXEaa	Typically chili beans are just pinto beans in sauce.

Place all of that in the hot oil in the frying pan and fry them until they are golden brown and the onions are golden brown as well. Of course you will turn them ever so often. You could also boil your pasta and once it s done throw in the canned diced tomatoes and put a tad bit (about a pinch of sugar) in them for pasta and tomatoes. There ya have it.|`|I7Ee17s0aa	You h|`|e7mz6lKxaa	Season them with salt and pepper a little paprika Just pan fry them in oil (you must have oil or cooking spray). Saute the onions in oil and add them to the pork chops. You can boil the potatoes and serve them in cubes with some butter (herbs if u like). I wouldn't do pasta and pork chops, at all. The rice is also a good idea, you could make it instead of potatoes, but since you dont have much seasonings, bland potatoes are best than bland rice. <br>  <br>  If the onions don't do much for you, you can skip them and just smother the pork chops in BBQ sauce when they are done.|`|2vHY9ZIIaa	The way it was done in the 30s, women bought recipe books from the newsagents, they were expensive and you had to go out to buy them, maybe travel in the cold and snow by horse drawn cart.<br>  <br>  Nowadays we have the internet and google and we could do this from  comfy surroundings, yet we are growing..  clever and clever.

AA10024510	I'm not sure I've ever made or met a stodgy french bread.  The French make lots of breads, but here in the US, what we call "french" bread means a simple 4-ingredient bread, such as:<br>  <br>  approx 3 cups all purpose flour<br>  approx 1 cup water<br>  1 tsp salt<br>  1 tsp yeast<br>  <br>  This is a bread machine recipe that makes one 1.5-pound loaf.  Of course, in France it would have been made into 2 or 3 baguettes baked at 500+ farenheit and eaten the same day, not a sandwich loaf baked at 350 farenheit anf then eaten over a few days, so the resulting comparison is apples and oranges.   Since it has no oil or eggs or milk, it will stale rather quickly, hence the desirability of being eaten the same day it is baked.|`|5cvPPWjEaa	French Bread Italian Style<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  1 cup water <br>  2 teaspoons sugar <br>  1 teaspoon salt <br>  3 cups bread flour <br>  2 tablespoons parmesan cheese <br>  1 tablespoon dried basil <br>  1 teaspoon dried oregano <br>  1 1/2 teaspoons bread machine yeast <br>  <br>  pictures and more recipes on<br>  <a href="http://www.foodsndrink.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.foodsndrink.blogspot.com</a>

17e9c7e9b8c52f6480ee24e65f4d402eaa	all cheese is made from curdled milk|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Milk. Duh!|`|g2R7e2eVaa	ground up asians!|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Parmigiano-Reggiano is a hard, fat granular cheese, cooked but not pressed, named after the producing areas of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, in Emilia-Romagna, and Mantova, in Lombardy, Italy.<br>  <br>  Parmigiano is simply the Italian adjective for Parma; the French version, Parmesan, is used in the English language. The term Parmesan is also loosely used as a common term for cheeses imitating true Parmesan cheese, especially outside Europe; within Europe, the Parmesan name is classified as a protected designation of origin.<br>  <br>   <br>  The sign on the border of Parma and Piacenza, indicating the start of the area of origin.Parmigiano-Reggiano is made from raw cow's milk. The whole milk of the morning milking is mixed with the naturally skimmed milk (it is left in large shallow tanks to allow the cream to separate) of the previous evening's milking, resulting in a part skim mixture. The milk is pumped into copper-lined vats (copper heats and cools quickly). Starter whey is added, and the temperature is raised to 33-35C. Calf rennet is added, and the mixture is left to curdle for 10-12 minutes. The curd is then broken up mechanically (spinitura in Italian) into small pieces (around the size of rice grains). The temperature is then raised to 55 °C with careful control by the cheese-maker. The curd is left to settle for 45-60 minutes. The compacted curd is collected in a piece of muslin before being divided in two and placed in moulds. There are 1100 L of milk per vat, producing two cheeses each. The curd making up each wheel at this point weighs around 45 kg (100 lb). The remaining whey in the vat was traditionally used to feed the pigs from which "Prosciutto di Parma" (cured Parma ham) is produced. The barns for these animals were usually just a few yards away from the cheese production rooms.<br>  <br>  The cheese is put into a stainless steel round form that is pulled tight with a spring powered buckle so the cheese retains its wheel shape. After a day or two, the buckle is released and a plastic belt imprinted numerous times with the Parmigiano-Reggiano name, the plant's number, and month and year of production is put around the cheese and the metal form is buckled tight again. The imprints take hold on the rind of the cheese in about a day and the wheel is then put into a brine bath to absorb salt for 20-25 days. After brining, the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for 12 months. Each cheese is placed on wooden shelves that can be 24 cheeses high by 90 cheeses long or about 4,000 total wheels per aisle. Each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned manually or robotically every 7 days. The cheese is also turned at this time.<br>  <br>   <br>  A factory of Parmigiano-Reggiano. There are two storerooms, both with 20 of these shelves.At 12 months, the Consorzio Parmigiano-Reggiano inspects each and every cheese. The cheese is tested by a master grader whose only instruments are a hammer and his ear. By tapping the wheel at various points, he can identify undesirable cracks and voids within the wheel. Those cheeses that pass the test are then heat branded on the rind with the Consorzio's logo. Those that don't pass the test used to have their rinds marked with lines or crosses all the way around to inform consumers that they are not getting top-quality Parmigiano-Reggiano; more recent practices simply have these lesser rinds stripped of all markings.<br>  <br>  Traditionally, cows have to be fed only on grass or hay, producing grass fed milk. Only natural whey culture is allowed as a starter, together with calf rennet.[1]<br>  <br>  The only additive allowed is salt, which the cheese absorbs while being submerged for 20 days in brine tanks saturated to near total salinity with Mediterranean sea salt. The product is aged an average of two years. The cheese is produced daily, and it can show a natural variability. True Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese has a sharp, complex fruity/nutty taste and a slightly gritty texture. Inferior versions can impart a bitter taste.|`|WhVSb2fbaa	parmesano cheese|`|55Xq3a5Laa	Milk curd|`|cRxoNPYkaa	Milk, just like any other cheese.

AA10299265	In the grand scheme of things, I think rodeos are small potatoes. What the government is doing (rewarding failing businesses who's CEOs are making obscene amounts of money) is far more serious and threatening to the American way of life.<br>  <br>  Life is about risks. People are always going to take them. If rodeo participants want to risk their necks with infuriated animals, I don't really have a problem with that. There are far more worthy causes out there.<br>  <br>  Like health issues, for example. Did you know that there are 10 times more diabetes patients than AIDS patients? Which one has been getting more headlines? <br>  <br>  Trying to right wrongs is about education. If you think rodeos are wrong, then join your local SPCA to see what you can do. Personally, I think there are other things that people do to animals that are far more cruel than what is done in rodeos.|`|I1Hu4jmyaa	No, I say ride them bulls.|`|AA12334360	The whole process is not just about riding, is it ?<br>  <br>  Think of all the selective breeding, killing of animals that don't make the grade, killing of animals that are weak, or sustain a fixible broken leg. don't forget caged transport, training sessions, breaking in etc.<br>  <br>  Its all about "dominance of man over animals", not a typical veggie or vegan belief<br>  <br>  its not a sport for me.

They are forced to do it and if they get injured, they're killed and sold as, well, a variety of things (meat, scrap meat for pet food, gelatin, etc.). <br>  <br>  Doesn't really sound great.|`|AA11173395	It seems most people have never actually been to a rodeo.  Next time you have this conversation, advise the person to pay attention to the bucking animal, whether it's a horse or a bull.  There is a belt strapped around his nether regions.  The only reason the animal bucks is because that belt is cinched tight around his gonads.  When a person gets on his back, it adds pressure and the pain becomes severe.  When the rider finishes or falls off, you will notice someone removing the belt, and the animal calms down instantly.<br>  <br>  It makes you wonder what sort of pervert invented the rodeo.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaTTaZT0V5g" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaTTaZT0V...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhcOtVgzjpo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhcOtVgzj...</a>|`|b9uOax0aaa	I have no problem at all with rodeos.<br>  <br>  edit  Thanks.

I don't care how well they eat when they're not in the rodeo and how much they can roam around "at home". <br>  When they are at the rodeo, they are angry. That's what makes them buck. I shudder to think what people use to make them upset. I highly doubt its waving a red flag in front of them. Some sort of torture is going on and I don't care for it. I think it's wrong.|`|yfwY8XGlaa	they're not wrong, but they are disrespectful to animals.  Riding a male bull, and poking him to aggravate him so that he can buck you off.  It's entertaining to some, but sometimes the bull does get his day.<br>  <br>  As for the other rodeo sports, no animals are killed, but I'd guess that they are treated ok.   There are a bunch of other things way worse, like bullfighting in Spain and Mexico.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Its a tough one, because to answer it truthfully you would have to decide whether you thought all riding was cruel (and some is more prolonged than the few Min's a rodeo horse has to do) and that would surely lead to the consideration of whether the keeping of any companion pet was wrong.<br>  Some vegans are so extreme as to not keep a pet of any kind and believe the only happy animal is a wild animal.<br>  My own stance is I love my pets and my horses and other animals get the best I can give them and are treated with as much love dignity and firmness as my kids (more sometimes :P).<br>  Check out this resolved question if you didn't;t already to see what I mean about other disciplins,<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkgsrJBthsFiJyaA5VM4KOwhBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090221235425AAfJiNM&show=7#profile-info-V962TU2taa">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|kMK9E2a7aa	It's an interesting question because it opens up a huge debate. Do vegans ride horses, or do they watch horse racing. Perhaps they love to watch showjumping. That all comes under the umbrella of your question. Horses in racing are a lot worse off than horses in a rodeo. A horse that breaks a leg will be put down, but they could repair the break, it's just too expensive to treat it.<br>  I would say a true vegan would have nothing to do with any sport using animals.|`|B08SSVz6aa	I have never seen a rodeo so I am commenting on what I have heard from others or seen on the telly. I can't see anything wrong with them at all. There is no cruelty involved like there is in bullfighting. I think rodeos are fine.

Meat pies, fruit pies, lasagna and other pasta dishes are good too but make sure there is plenty of sauce in them. Make up some hamburgers or meatballs and freeze them flat on a tray then put them in bags in portion sizes and freeze. You can even make up and freeze sandwiches as long as you don't use vegetables in them like lettuce etc or fill long rolls with roast chicken or roast beef too. I wouldnt leave anything in the freezer for longer than 3 - 6 months. Check them every week for freezer burn and use them in the order you made them.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Almost all clear soups, like chicken noodle.

2RzEaod9aa	Humans will farm. <br>  <br>  There's no reason we have to abuse animals for it. <br>  <br>  If you want to get technical, it would be considered enslaving the oxen because they aren't doing it willfully (they don't fill out a job application or anything, lol), but on the same token I assume they are well-treated and taken care of. And I'm sure they get to eat of their labor as well.<br>  <br>  I would consider this type of farming to be peaceful, where farmer and farm animal work together.|`|VDdEMPsdaa	It is the best way of farming, the Oxen are used instead of machinaries... when we have machines, we don't need the oxen and thus they are killed byt the unuscrupoulous people and the cow is used to give milk, without explore her by human's way and the milk used for the household, not for comercialization, at it would means to kill and exploite the cows.... this type of farm it was suppost to be, it is Vedic.|`|b9uOax0aaa	If the entire world farmed that way 90% of you would starve.|`|doz7RIoeaa	I know you live in Spain (you said so yourself) and the country where I live now, it's the same way. Most single family crop farm are still manual or animal labor intensive for the most part because machinery is just too expensive. The beast of burden here though is the water buffalo. It's used for plowing, for transportation of people and goods, sometimes for stud services, then eventually sold for meat. The owners will beg, borrow or steal to care for and keep their animals and rustling a very serious offense,. Rustlers are more than likely to be lynched if caught. That's why when a local PETA chapter tried to give put leaflets against the use of the buffalo and tried to shut down a   buffalo breeding program, they were chased away by the locals<br>  The freedom to choose enjoyed by vegans and veganism itself would be totally alien and totally unacceptable in this place where survival, not food choice, is a daily challenge.|`|AA11525569	i wouldnt eat that food. the animals are being forced to do labor.. kind of like slaves (thats how i see it) and thats wrong to me. so i guess yeah, i would have a problem with that. even if the animals arent harmed, theyre held against their will to do something to benefit humans. <br>  <br>  naw. i wouldnt be okay with that. <br>  <br>  and im vegan. <br>  <br>  so i hope that answers it.|`|B08SSVz6aa	I think this is the best way of farming if it can be done. I remember as a child there was crop rotation on the farm we had and one year the land was left but clover was grown that year, and for some reason there was a donkey on that land that year.|`|aO3BCQAnaa	I'm a vegetarian, but not a vegan (mostly for practical reasons.)<br>  <br>  I would give using oxen to plough fields a rating somewhere between neutral and positive. By using oxen to plough fields you are essentially using them as a tool to produce goods for humans. This brings the oxen in to a type of forced contract with the farmers where they supply labour in exchange for housing, food and security. However, since this is not their natural condition and they have no choice in the matter, this is degrading to the animal's dignity. Personally, I find that this argument doesn't hold much water (especially if the animal is in very good health.)<br>  <br>  We must also consider what the alternatives to using oxen are. By favouring oxen over tractors we reduce reliance on oils, metals and plastics, all of which create a myriad of environmental problems (either by extracting, combusting or disposal) and social problems (wars for oil, exploitation of the poor, economies reliant on finite resources, etc.) On the flip side, using a tractor over an ox increases our trade relations, which is said to stimulate economic growth (that's what this protectionism debate is all about right now.) Also, there is always to consider the resources used to birth and maintain oxen that wouldn't be born if this job didn't exist for them.<br>  <br>  The other possibility that using oxen excludes is using human labour to manually plough the fields. This option is, in my opinion, better than some may think (yes I know, this sounds like a feudal system.) Using humans to produce food can have some positive effects (like decreasing food waste and land mismanagement, creating jobs, make food prices reflect its true cost, simplifying unnecessarily complicated lives, increasing general awareness of the farming process and problems associated with it.) However, this argument (and the benefits associated with it) is totally unrealistic in today's economy; simply put humans can't produce as cheaply as animals can. And that's what mostly matters.<br>  <br>  So use oxen? Sure, why not. Its probably a little better than tractors and way more realistic than humans.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Let the vegans grow their own food and keep their hands off mine!|`|AA12334360	I guess vegans would not want food from that farm.<br>  <br>  vegans try, within practical limits, to avoid any animal exploitation. using an ox to work the land is exploitation, no matter how well kept the animal is.<br>  <br>  Not saying its right or wrong, but as the "vegan way" is to avoid any animal exploitation, and its practical to buy elsewhere,  then its quite clear they should avoid that produce.<br>  <br>  I would love to ask "Mrs Bewick" why there would be no cows, pigs or oxon without carnivores, but something tells me I'd be frustrated and  baffled by any "logic" in the reply.

Just don't take too long to make your flowers and keep the bowl you make it in covered with a damp towel so it all doesn't go hard. Just add enough lemon juice to the icing sugar to make it as liquid as you want it to be and beat it for a while until it is all smooth and glossy.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Cream of tartar.

EMDNVrcjaa	I can't find any place to buy them but here is some information for you.<br>  <br>  Star apples are generally in season from late winter or early spring to early summer. They do not fall when ripe but must be hand-picked by clipping the stem. Care must be taken to make sure that they are fully mature. Otherwise the fruits will be gummy, astringent and inedible. When fully ripe, the skin is dull, a trifle wrinkled, and the fruit is slightly soft to the touch.<br>  <br>  (Chrysophyllum cainito), tropical American tree, of the sapodilla family (Sapotaceae), native to the West Indies and Central America. It is cultivated for its edible fruit, which is the size and shape of an apple and is named for the star-shaped core. The surface of the fruit is firm and smooth. Both the skin and the flesh, which is sweet and tasty, vary in colour, ranging from white to purple. The tree grows about 7.5–15 m (25–50 feet) tall and has purplish white flowers.
HFLEBJn2aa	try looking around convoy.. i know very vague but its something
erhdsNHHaa	Definitely eat breakfast, even if you're not hungry.<br>  What happens is that while you sleep, your body goes into starvation mode because you haven't eaten in 8 hours (or however long you slept for) so your metabolism slows way down to try and preserve calories.  Your body basically thinks you are fasting (not eating any food) and tries to preserve the calories it has as it doesn't know when or if you will eat again.  <br>  <br>  When you eat breakfast, you are literally breaking the fast, and your metabolism kicks in again.|`|mNzgWFkGaa	Yes you should always eat something for breakfast, it's just that as part of a healthy diet it sets you up for the day and makes sense because it sees you through to lunchtime and therefore your not tempted to eat snacks and stuff that is less healthy for you.  You don't have to have a great big breakfast, a couple of slices of toast and jam and a cup of tea is  good enough.  But to be really healthy breakfast  i would add a yoghurt and a piece of fruit to that.|`|7a29609061cc85b8213f55d1598f7a9aaa	I am never normally not hungry in the mornings, but i always eat breakfast<br>  <br>  It's a scientific thing, not just a saying.<br>  <br>  The body needs to 'break its fast' from not eating all night<br>  <br>  A good healthy breakfast puts your blood sugar levels up and should help you have the energy to take you through to lunch<br>  <br>  I knwo what you mean though, i always find it such a hassle eating something decent early in the morning|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Yeah, "they" have always said that.I think "they" are nuts.

After me telling them what would happen they said I was ORDERED to eat. A couple times of puking in the bushes and ther retracted their order.

When you skip breakfast your brain is forced to work extra hard in breaking down stored carbohydrates or to turn fats and proteins into usable forms of glucose. Eating breakfast has been proven to improve concentration, increase your problem solving capabilities, enhance overall mental performance and even boosts your memory and mood.<br>  <br>  Reason #2: Your metabolism will go into ‘famine’ mode.<br>  <br>  Three to four hours after you eat, your metabolism shuts down and acts as if it needs to store food. This is a great function to have if a famine were to break out, leaving you without food for days. Since this is likely not the case for you, it is pretty annoying when your body starts packing on the pounds in an attempt to protect you from starvation! Eating breakfast communicates with your body the fact that you are healthy, well fed and not in need of extra fat storage.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Breakfast is the exception to the rule then. And if you get in the habit of eating breakfast you will start being hungry in the morning.|`|doz7RIoeaa	Don't eat immediately after you wake up. Do your morning ritual first, maybe even some light exercise, dress up etc. After that you will usually feel a bit hungry. Many people skip breakfast usually end up binge eating eating with junk mid morning which leads to really bad food choices and eating habits.<br>  <br>  My granny always says: For breakfast eat like a king, for lunch eat like a queen and for supper, eat like a beggar.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	I am never hungry in the morning either, but I know if I don't have anything to eat, I will be starving in a couple of hours time. Just have something small like a slice of toast or bowl of cereal. Even a cereal bar or fruit would do if you are in a rush.|`|2RzEaod9aa	You should be eating 5-6 small meals per day to keep your metabolism running.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't CONTINUE to eat a meal if you're already full.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that clears it up for you.|`|bxlYleZkaa	I never go anywhere or do anything until I have had my breakfast.
