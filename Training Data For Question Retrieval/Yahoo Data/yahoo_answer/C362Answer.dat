omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho. I like how their color palette is laid out, I like that you can search by color family & color name, the "painted" rooms look the most realistic, and it suggests coordinating color schemes. You can literally spend hours:  http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/    I think "quietude" (  6212) might be a good choice.    You can take a photo of your house & upload it to the makeover gallery on this website:  http://www.roomvues.com/  You can get color suggestions & for $5 they'll photoshop them onto your room so that you can get an idea of what it will look like.|`|Dl6NIYt5aa	Blue looks fabulous. But it looks fabulous to my eyes as I like blue. What color do you like? Go for that if it looks suitable enough.

I'm giving you some links where you will find a lot of ideas as well as tips on how to groom the looks and style of your home.|`|upZK1dDiaa	Baby pink, lime green, baby blue, baby purple or even light yellow looks fabulous!

Spray Shout on the stain, rub it in and let set for a while. Then wash in cold water and air dry to make sure stain is gone.  If you use hot water or warm water when washing you will set the stain along with using your dryer.

We're going to do out kitchen floor with it this summer.|`|57502521dc0b77626e264db4b7c3aaf2aa	You do not want epoxy.  There is a polyurethane  finish that will do what you want.  You buy it in craft stores.  I did this 35 years ago on the mantle of my fireplace, but I don't know the name.      The liquid was a pain to work with.  You could only mix up a small batch because it set up to quickly.  If you stirred it to fast and made bubbles in the mix you had to heat with a torce to cause the air to expand and pop.  You had to do a bunch of small batches cause it set up too fast.  It really turned out great over rough sawn cedar, but never again.|`|KZCUs612aa	1. strip off what's there  2. Stain it to your preference 3. Use a soft damp cloth to wipe away dust and use a hair drier on mid heat to raise the wood grain. Start with 120 grit then 200 grit.wet/dry sand paper wipe again with damp cloth and blow dry and repeat the sanding process.Just wipe over lightly with each grit. this will be the last time you use the 120 grit. 4. apply your first coat of polypropylene (poly) Now repeat the damp cloth wipe no hair dryer now then at first with 200 grit then 400 grit...let dry 24 hrs and repeat the process every day for a week...Yep! 6-8 coats. You'll have a durable slick and if you like ,a glossy finish by using high gloss. I prefer the satin finish on tops to reduce the reflective glare that comes off of ceiiling lights.|`|Dl6NIYt5aa	There are several products but it is better to get the latest product.

jN8duTx2aa	I just helped my 26 year old brother with this problem.    -Don't put up photos of hot girls.  It can be off putting for the women you want to have visiting your place.  No retro pinups either.  Lots of girls don't care, but why put off the ones that do care?    -Avoid anything fratty.  EX- Wedding crashers poster, Beer poster    -Sports stuff is fine, if you're into it, but don't cover the house in it.  1 or 2 is enough.  Often the retro stuff is nicer than the current stuff.    -Consider a few pictures/paintings of favorite places.  Your hometown, your favorite city.    -Frame it, don't tack it up.  allposters.com will do it for you a little cheaper than a professional framer.  The cheapest option is to get frames from Target or Bed Bath and Beyond.  If you can't find a frame the exact size, put some plain poster board behind it like a fake mat.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	art, pictures, mirrors, and posters. idk maybe put up awards and certificates or even calenders|`|nbWO3IANaa	1] posters of fav things - bands, movies, sports [ not too much ] and NO BEER ones - turns off girls  2] photos of great vacations - a few family photos are good - not in your bedroom though  3] dining room - framed wine labels  4] kitchen - framed fav foods  5] words [ truth, think, create, etc. ]|`|oyjMey2Taa	Pictures of family|`|dFBccLExaa	Ujmmmm... pictures?

But when painting with a Dark rich color you need to buy good paint I personally think Porter Paint is best for dark colors.
VFmmVHGVaa	As long as the ground is not frozen,most important is to support a new tree with four stakes and wire or rope.This prevents the roots from moving when the wind blow ,the most common failure of new plantings.Use a short section od old garden hose around the tree,put the gide wires through them first to protect the tree.|`|eno6OVKuaa	HI winter time is the best time to plant tree because they are at rest.  As long as the roots are kept covered so the frost don't get to them the tree will be ok.  But don't plant if the ground is to frosty.  OK|`|ZgOI7leMaa	The best answer are questions. Where do you live? Is your ground frozen? Are the fruit trees budded or leafed out? If the answers are that you are in a warm climate and you will no longer have hard killing frosts, the trees are budded or leafed out and the ground is not frozen - then it is time to plant your trees.
4SKIE1C8aa	Nail polish remover definitely does remove permanent marker BUT make sure you spot test in the bottom corner first (wait at least 15 min) to make sure it doesn't harm the screen!|`|AA12092525	Try a cotton ball slightly dampened with rubbing alcohol.=)|`|FedwTHHlaa	Nail polish romover takes permanent marker off of lots of stuff, so i imagine it should work okay on a tv screen. Good luck.|`|T19HI9mFaa	Yes. Get a dry erase marker and a a soft cloth or paper towel. Trace over the markings and wipe it clean immediately. Your marks will be gone.    We do this at school when a teacher uses a permanent marker on the white board. It also works on some metallic surfaces. At home, my partner accidentally marked his computer screen with a marker for writing on CDs/DVDs. It came off very easily.    This is, I think, the safest way to remove permanent marker from many kinds of surfaces..|`|dMbGEa8taa	Hey!! Be at ease, i have found one of the best ways to removed permanent marker from almost any surface. Works best on hard smooth surfaces but maybe in cloths. Try dry erase Marker. Does not have to be black maybe a lighter color. But when i used it i would kinda scrub lightly with the Dry Erase Marker tip,
oyjMey2Taa	its got a piolet light in the bottom that has to be lit. Do not attempt to do it yourself and do not turn on the oven. Call a service tech or a Handyman in your area|`|jWtquDVUaa	I'm sure you will find it online somewhere, so if you are sure of yourself. You can do it step be step the way the missing instructions would instruct you. Would be to be sure all gas control knobs are in the off position. Remove the oven bottom and find the pilot.Once your sure you have found it, light a match 1st and hold it at the pilot and then push the oven knob in and hold it, it should light. When it does light hold the oven knob in for a min. or so, release the knob if it stays lit your good to go. If it doesn't then wait 5 min. for it to air out in case there is any gas left in the oven. And try again. If after that it still doesn't light call for service.
3PihER7Raa	first remove all the trim in the house that needs to be refinished. label the backside of the trim along with the position of the wall where the trim was. use a paint remover or stripper if the paint is on there thick. then sand the trim smooth you may need to fill in nicks on the trim if you fill in the nicks you will need to re sand. then you will need to stain the trim for a brand new looking finish. i like to use poly shades made by minwax it has the stain and poly. all in one. its a big job if your doing your whole house but you will love to outcome.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	You will need to use a paint remover. The 100% best remover I know of is call "ready strip". trust me if you don't get this you will be mad at your self! This is so EZ to use. please see: http://www.readystripsales.com/|`|oyjMey2Taa	You'll have to use a stripper and scrape it off or sand it with sand paper. Depending on how old this paint is sanding or burning it off could be dangerous do to lead. Get it tested.|`|Vl4ZLrf5aa	If the trim is pretty ornate, than what you'll want to use is a product called Peel Away. This product is a chemical stripper that you brush onto the trim, cover with special paper, and let sit overnight. The next day, you "peel away" the paper and off comes the paint. The stuff is amazing, and I've used it on the ornamental trim on my Victorian home. What's great about the product is that there is no sanding plus it encapsulates any lead paint that may be on the house.    We've had to order it on-line but you might call around to local paint stores to see if anyone carries it locally.

Tk9EGrz6aa	________, Try calling a local florist and they most likely answer your questions. I found a large online list of Florida local florists. http://www.localfloristsonline.com/Flori... I suggest phoneing a florist close to where you live.|`|oyjMey2Taa	Pretty flowers|`|gH7D8F0Caa	Purple: Echinacea Purpurea, Painted Daisy, Bergenia, Columbine (need to find the purple color for Bergenia and Columbine).    Yellow: Rudbeckia, Helenium Autumnale    They are herbaceous perennials, which means they will die back in winter, but the roots will stay alive and sprout back in the spring.  The only plant that will be evergreen will be the Bergenia. So you might think about placing it in some strategic spots in your garden.      If you will go to a nursery near you in the middle of March you will probably already find most of these plants.|`|YMwUpBIAaa	cannas are some really nice flowers. tropicana is one of the set verieties because they have bright orange flowers on a stalk and dark muilricolored huge leaves. In temperate areas these thrive in the summer, but die at a hard frost. then they come up round may for another year. In south florida these are all year plants, and will stay in bloom through most of the year. an occasional frost might knock it down once in a while, but they will come right back up. Cannas also have yellow and pink flowers as well as white, red and all in between. they even have different colored leaves and come in different heigts wil tall verieties growing to 15 feet and dwarf ones to 3.    hibiscus are also a really nice choice. they come in just about every color as well and will love the heat. these do die at frost.    also geraniums can survive all year. ivy geraniums continue to bloom until frost and usually die after that, but in s florida frosts are not too cmmon.    the orange biids of paradise is a smaller bush and wont grow into a huge plant like the white birds of paradise. they look really nice in large groupings and are in bloom from early spring to late fall, and some in the winter as well,
ggR5FFDjaa	you can get it at Lowe's, should start around $100 and go up from there.  You will have problems, first carpet for you car needs to be really heavy duty, home carpet will be destroyed pretty quick.  Also, you will need a band sewn around it to keep it from unraveling.  You can maybe find a piece custom made for your car on ebay or jcwhitney.

XgOIlU0eaa	its their responsibility to change it but most dont really need it every month..the filter mfr wants everyone to buy 12 a year instead of what you really need...that depends on how many pets,how dusty the home is,etc..most are fine changing it 4 times a year......dan|`|WTiMxoxFaa	they may be cause they had people change our air filter and we did not ask|`|5oXzkJReaa	I have lived and worked on many different apartment buildings. It all depends on the management. I would check your lease or rental agreement. Usually the maintenance personnel will change it in the fall and spring but leave it up to you to replace between then. I tell all my customers to check the filter once a month and change it when it gets dirty. this will prevent failure of the furnace and a/c when you need it most
94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	Sounds to me like you didn't let it soak long enough.    It should peel off, if you're careful.  If it does, just buy a BOX of wallpaper paste (the powdered kind), and put it up with that.  Don't buy the tube.  That's for another thing.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	It will not be usable if you take it off. Try wetting the areas with a wet sponge and apply pressure to the paper. A wallpaper smoothing brush would be a good idea to use.|`|zFb022Iiaa	If you buy the cheap stuff that's stocked in discount stores it's really hard to work with or count on.   If you put it up with wallpaper paste you might get away with it.      I learned the hard way and I usually pick something out in the wallpaper books and then instead of ordering from the expensive store there are ads in the back of all the womens magazines (good housekeeping whatever) you call and get deep discounts on the same paper or border.  It really makes a difference.|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	oh wowwwwww|`|PRx6j6YQaa	you can buy in a tube wall paper glue that you can put the spot that lifted up

0qpf53GCaa	In general Dyson vacuums are not all they're cracked up to be. However right out of the box they should clean ok. The brushroll doesn't self adjust on those, but the entire nozzle housing does. There is a seperate motor for the brushroll, so be sure that you have that one turned on and the brush roll is spinning. Other then that, trade it in for a Riccar or a Sebo :)|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Should have bought a Hoover.  You could take it back to see if they will replace it.  You may have gotten a bad one or one that does not operate properly. Good Luck!!!!|`|eZDoQPg8aa	No, the Dyson does not have to be better than a Dirt Devil just because you spent more money on it.  You have just fallen for the advertising hype put out by Dyson.  I honestly think the reason you don't see any bad reviews is that most people are ashamed of themselves for spending that much on a sweeper only to find out that it doesn't work all that well.  And some people will have one and swear they are wonderful just because they cost a lot of money.Their products are very highly over-rated and not built all that well.    Take the Dyson  back and go get a Bissell Healthy Home and have some fun with the extra money you'll save.  The Bissell Healthy home adjusts as you are lamenting about and has a lot of other features and works like a charm.  Even in my house with 3 dogs and 4 cats and kids!
1003103a251252e9c258e1cd7c3fd1d6aa	Yes, take the aerator off. If it does not work the divertor is stuck. The divertor is a plunger type of part that located in the faucet base or cartridge. When you push the trigger on the sprayer the divertor senses the pressure drop in the sprayer hose and diverts the water from the faucet tap to the sprayer. Yours is stuck in the "sprayer" position if the faucet does not work with the aerator off. Here is a delta divertor which is on the front inside the base underneath the faucet head. Look up your brand of faucet to find out where the divertor is.    http://www.lowes.com/lowes/lkn?action=pr...|`|1kZenfZzaa	It may be plugged, take the cap off and see if you can rinse out the screen, see if that helps.  Otherwise, I don't know.  Good luck!
dkoGI9nfaa	If you have a steam cleaner it will do a perfect job.  If not you can use either very hot water and preferably sugar soap.  Wash it well and dry off.  If there is still wax repeat.  If you don't have sugar soap use detergent.  Methylated spirits will also remove it.  You also need to test and repeat.  You can also use a combination of the above.  Hop you get it off.
lavd3UHmaa	use a dark color on the baseboards, and then a lighter color on the walls (then white can stay if you can't face another weekend of painting!)  The baseboards being a dark(er) color will help stop the eye from 'scanning' the room as a whole and keep you from comparing your fashion sense with the orange carpet!!. Then you can use some accent colors that match well with the rug (ie) dark browns, Ruddy Reds, Purples...but use sparingly...they are accents only.  Good luck.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	Maybe you could paint the walls a soft sandy shade and get bedding that incorporates the orange and browns and sandy colors.  Here are some that might work for you:  http://landjs-varietyshop.ecrater.com/pr...  http://www.bellacor.com/productdetail/32...  http://www.bellacor.com/productdetail/32...  http://www.humbleabode.com/zachary-comfo...  http://www.smartbargains.com/go.sb?pagen...  If you still can't stand all that orange, buy a huge area rug in a beige shade to cover most of it.  Good luck!|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Use a rug on top of the carpet to try to hide it.|`|JbJA6Gt6aa	I think it'd look nice to have a striped brown/black/white curtains, I think the problem you're facing is probably that the carpet contrasts too much with the white walls, it's a lot of white coming up from an orange floor. Use fabrics to center  your eye between the carpet and the top of the walls.|`|djmu98oUaa	Orange is a very "hot" color that used as a pure color will promote energy in a room...You've probably rarely seen any room painted in pure orange or have a lot of pure orange decore. Most likely because a room done in pure orange is simply too much, too bright, too hot and not restful. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not telling you to never use pure orange in a color scheme... just have a reason. Perhaps it's a child's playroom and you paint a table bright orange. Or perhaps it's a lamp shade or funky lamp.  To use orange successfully in most rooms.
4z0Rk4Ddaa	You could make your own and put them in a zip lock baggie.  Mix up what ever you want to use to clean the cups with and dip paper towels in your cleaning solution then fold and put in zip lock baggies. Pour a little bit of your cleaning solution in the bag to help keep them moist. You could also make one up of plain water also.
256fe92c1f48eeee32f2750edc89baafaa	Are you sure it's a foundation problem?  The house is 100, so is the foundation stone or concrete?  If it's concrete, is it cracked?  When they settle they do so unevenly and the walls crack - of course stone foundations can move and you won't see it. If you really have a foundation problem then you need to understand why - 100 years of accumulated settling is possible and just releveling might be ok.  But if it moved a lot lately then why?  drainage changes outside?  Some interior changes that changed the load?  You ave to know because there are ways to stop a foundation that is moving and ways to level a foundation that has moved but is no longer moving.  If you just relevel a foundation that is still moving you are wasting your time and money.    But how out of level are these floors?  and is it extensive or localized?  Mid wall or in a corner?  What about rotting or termite riddled sill plates?  Or a slowly failing knee wall?    You could call a general contractor to come offer an opinion.  Or a home inspector like the ones that you have to hire before the bank will give you a mortgage on a new house.  Some will give you the first look for free.  I wouldn't start with a foundation specialist unless you're really sure you've got foundation problems.|`|950m8WZvaa	Typically you use hydrolic jacks or pole jacks in the lower areas.It can take weeks of leveling to get the floors leveled. Then you either shim up on top of your stem walls and footers with lumber or you replant new footers and frame from them to the underside of the joists. Cross beams can really help when leveling then you carry a level load end to end if you can get a beam underneath|`|35qbxLCpaa	I would go for the insurance and a builder because your house is moving.
AA11739538	I agree with Jim K just make sure the switch is off before you try and free it you don't want it to start up with a tool or your finger in there. just figured I wound mention it|`|1003103a251252e9c258e1cd7c3fd1d6aa	It may still be stuck.See if you can get the motor to turn.... Look on the bottom of the disposal, is there a "hex" shaped socket in the center ? This is for a disposal wrench. If your disposal does not have a socket you can get a disposal tool like this one. (link below) Use the tool to turn the motor back and forth until it turns freely. It may be really jammed  so you may have to turn it hard to get it started. The worst thing you will have to do is replace it anyway....If you can get it to turn try a shop vac to get all the loose pieces out then run it using LOTS of water to get the pieces of the penny to go out. Let the disposal it run with water going down 2-3 minutes. Good luck     http://www.generaltools.com/Products/Gar...|`|950m8WZvaa	You Bent the impeller now it's out of balance.|`|6O4WTiPQaa	Look closely in there with a flashlight and see if there is anything else stuck in the grinder plate.  If not, you probably did bend the impeller like the other guy mentioned.

H5NGXgqsaa	It is true that the Mr Clean Magic Erasers do a terric job at getting the film off shower doors! I discovered that trick sometime ago & WOW... What I usually do though is clean the door with a cleaner like comet or similar then rinse, then I take the Majic Erasers & see the film just come off! Afterwards I dry them & apply a spray that deters water drops & resists soap scum[lasts about a month or more]...this helps water to simply sheet right off. We also keep a little squeegee in all our showers so we keep water from remaining on them by taking a quick moment to squeegee the water off! Really helps keep our glass clean! Saves alot of uneccessary work!|`|OBA3Iciraa	Use Borax, it's safer than CLR, and it will sparkle!  Make a paste with a sponge and scrub the scum away!|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	Use Lime Away or CLR on it and either one of those should clean your shower doors up.|`|b2aw7iWtaa	vinegar and newspaper|`|xV4qOG4Iaa	Zidane gave you a good answer but left out it should be white vinegar, and newspaper even a soft clean cloth just to buff it up after.|`|AA11498082	Mr. Clean Magic Eraser.  No chemicals, no smell, Excellent results.
0qpf53GCaa	nooo!!! Kirby's are way over priced. plus you can probably talk them down to 1500 or less. But the design in kirbys have hardly changed in the last 15 years. They are not innovative or taking advantage of technology. I would definitely spend over $500 for a vacuum however, because it is well worth it to get into that level of vacuums. I'm a vac tech at a vacuum and sewing shop. Check into Riccar and Sebo. You will be so much happier!! and at least $1200 richer!!|`|944iJNAdaa	It's hard for me to think any vacuum is worth $2000, either.  Even though Kirby makes reliable vacuums, as rated by Consumer Reports.    However, you do have health problems you hope to make better.  I wonder if you've investigated a built-in vacuum system instead?  I like those, because all the dirt is sucked outside the house, and there's no chance of this dust blowing back into your house like lots of vacuum cleaners allow to happen (like when the bag is full, or not filtering so well).|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	No!!!!! I would never spend that much money for a vacuum.  It would be easier to buy a more reasonable priced vacuum that will do just as good as that one.
