Alla presentazione della domanda è necessaria la presenza del minore.<br>  <br>  La domanda (barrare il riquadro del rilascio lasciapassare), disponibile presso la Questura, il Commissariato di Pubblica Sicurezza o la stazione dei Carabinieri, può essere consegnata in questi stessi uffici.<br>  <br>  Alla domanda deve essere allegato:<br>  <br>      * l'assenso di entrambi i genitori (pdf 8 Kb) o il nulla osta del giudice tutelare; (Se l'altro genitore è impossibilitato a presentarsi per la dichiarazione, può allegare una fotocopia del documento firmato in originale e il suo assenso scritto).<br>      * il certificato di nascita o l’estratto del certificato di nascita;<br>      * 2 foto formato tessera identiche e recenti.|`|SvuTcwcCaa	guarda io qnd sono and in slovenia sono dovuta andare al comune a fare l'espatrio...un foglio che ti autorizza! ti serva una foto e x qnt riguarda le firme non ricordo...ricordo solo che qnd andai al comune c'era con me solo mio padre e quindi la firma l'ha messa lui...non ricordo poi se qst documento l'ha portato a casa  farglielo firmare a mia madre...ciao ciao|`|M6CN6h9xaa	si dv avere tt 2 le firme del genitore ma xk ? ciao|`|TB1PmB45aa	Io avevo smarrito la carta d'identità ma quando sono andata a farmela rifare mi hanno chiesto solo la firma di mia madre ma penso che ci vogliano dei documenti che lo devono specificare...

You do have to send a couple out to receive them yourself, but its cheap and quite nice recieving a postcard from someone in another country.Its free to sign up too. You can even request what postcards you like best. Visit www.postcrossing.com for more info. thanks :)
bmP4NdKuaa	No. The Metra system is designed as a commuter line to get people downtown to go to work.

Metra is planning the STAR line, a suburban line that utilizes the EJE rail lines around the exurbs and runs into O'Hare.  It will likely take 10-20 years to happen.<br>  <br>  You could take Metra trains from Joliet into the Loop and then back out to Schaumburg.  The Metra Heritage Coridor runs from Joliet To Chicago Union Station.  Also departing from Union Station is the Milwaukee District West line which stops in Schaumburg.  It is not a straight route but it will get you there without a car.<br>  <br>  The second link below will help - click on a rail line and it will then give you links that show you specifically where each station on that line is located.

GTigNR0Caa	I'm actually in a similar situation as you, I moved to Tokyo to live with my boyfriend so we can test the waters before taking that step to marriage so I can totally understand what must be going through your mind right now.<br>  <br>  As for jobs for foreigners, most people seem to be either English teachers, recruiters or in IT, all jobs that require little or no Japanese and can be part time but it really depends on what you want to do.  Since you can speak Japanese there may be more opportunities available for you.<br>  <br>  If you would like to do some tutoring on the side, you can find students here:<br>  <a href="http://findateacher.net/" rel="nofollow">http://findateacher.net/</a> <br>  -or-<br>  <a href="http://www.orangutanenglish.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.orangutanenglish.com/</a><br>  You just need to put up a profile and students can contact you directly.  You decide the rate and the location.  There are no sign up fees since they charge the students for using their site to search for teachers.<br>  <br>  If you like to shop, I suggest exploring the streets of Omotesando, Harajuku, Shibuya and Daikanyama just to name a few.  There's just too many cool places to check out so you won't have any problem finding things to do here.  I'm sure everyday will be a new adventure so take it easy and enjoy!|`|5ZtSR0IQaa	Aside from looking at job listings in the Japan Times or Craigslist Tokyo, there's the Japan Association for Working Holiday Makers.<br>  <a href="http://www.jawhm.or.jp/eng/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jawhm.or.jp/eng/</a><br>  <br>  They have job listings that they give out only when you visit their office in person. I suppose they do that to make sure the person getting the job listing really has a working holiday visa and isn't a general job seeker.|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	Sorry, but it's a dumb idea to go somewhere and not have a job lined up.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'd assure a job before even moving to a new city in the US!|`|eAMbWkahaa	You don't have to work part-time, people often work regular hours with the WHV without problems.  However finding a job in the current economic conditions is very tough.  The most obvious job you would want to look for is being an English Instructor.  Finding those are though these days too, but you have a WHV and that is a good visa to have since employers don't need to sponsor you.<br>  <br>  As for tips for tokyo, trains in tokyo can be complicated so check out this guide to using trains in Tokyo:<br>  <a href="http://www.tokyosubway.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.tokyosubway.info</a><br>  also general information on money, eating cheaply (saving money on food etc) at <a href="http://tokyoexpert.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://tokyoexpert.blogspot.com</a>|`|jZzYi3MLaa	So you're just going to come here and roll the dice? I like your spunk, but not very practical.<br>  <br>  What you can do is run a classified ad offering your services in one of the local rags for pvt. tutoring, but the major ESL schools might not hire you without a college degree.<br>  <br>  What's more, unless you speak Japanese, you might have a difficult time finding a job with a Japanese company.<br>  <br>  Try the Westin in Ebisu, that is if you don't mind working for a hotel. The one thing the major hotels here do need is English speaking staff members.<br>  <br>  One thing I would hope for you is that you have some close friends here who can help you.|`|e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	Like Tokyo E says, no one cares if you work full time on WHV. It's tough for finding teaching work these days, but the WHV does make you desirable to employees. If you do some sort of menial work at least you will be getting out of the gaijin ghetto and really learning about Japanese society. I used to tend bar in Japan and that was really interesting-and the job provided my meals. The luxury hotels are actually a pretty good suggestion. I don't know why people are so down on you for taking a roll of the dice-it's as if they were never ever young!|`|AA12004593	I know many Americans teaching English here in Tokyo area.  Many of them belong to agencies, as far as I know.  Or some are hired directly by municipal government.  English education in Japan is getting more important year by year.  So, I think there are lots of job opportunites.  Good luck.

Jm3vMKx3aa	A Schengen visa is the common tourist or business visa valid for 25 European countries for short visits of up to 90 days in a 6 month period.<br>  <br>  The visa application must be made at the embassy of the country you plan to stay. If you want to visit several countries you must apply where you plan to stay the longest time. If that should be equally distrubuted you need to apply at the country you enter first. The Schengen area consits of the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.<br>  <br>  The requirements for a visa vary based on the type of visa and the location of the embassy. Typical requirements for a tourist visa for up to 90 days within a six months period would be.<br>  <br>  ? a national passport or official travel document valid for more than 3 months beyond the validity of the requested visa, with a blank visa page to affix the visa sticker. <br>  ? a Residence permit which must also exceed by more than 3 months the validity of the requested visa id the application is not made at the home country. <br>  ? the standardized Schengen visa application form duly completed and signed by the applicant (or the legal guardian for children), <br>  ? one or two photographs, <br>  ? proof of financial means of support: a recent statement of your bank account or traveller’s cheques. A minimum amount required per day of stay various between the Schengen countries. For France it is €45, for Germany €60, <br>  ? proof of travel: a confirmed booking of a return ticket or booking from your travel agent (including itinerary if participating in a tour), <br>  ? proof of accommodation: a confirmed hotel reservation for the whole of your stay in the Schengen space or an official invitation leeter or affidavit of support to be obtained by the person you are visiting if visiting relatives or friends,  <br>  ? proof of holding a travel insurance including medical cover and repatriation with at least €30,000 limit, valid for the Schengen area. It must cover the duration of the requested visa. Some embassies which send the visa by mail require the proof with the visa application; other who require the visa to be picked up want to see the insurance certificate and the return flight ticket when the visa is picked-up. <br>  <br>  Additional documents to be produced according to the applicant’s current occupation:<br>  <br>  If employed: <br>  ? an official up-to-date letter from your employer stating the position held within the company as well as the starting date as well as the period of leave granted, <br>  ? the last 3 payslips.<br>  <br>  If self-employed, person of independent or private means: <br>  ? an up-to-date letter from your solicitor, your accountant, your Bank Manager, or your local Chamber of Commerce.<br>  ? the last income tax certificate<br>  <br>  If studying: <br>  ? an official up-to-date letter from your school, college or university stating the type of studies, details of course and attendance record.<br>  <br>  If you are a scientist visiting for professional purposes for a stay less than 3 months: <br>  ? an official invitation to be obtained by the research company inviting you <br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/WillkommeninD/EinreiseUndAufenthalt/Schengen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.esteri.it/MAE/EN/Ministero/Servizi/Stranieri/ServReteConsolare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.esteri.it/MAE/EN/Ministero/Se...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.manila.diplo.de/Vertretung/manila/en/01/Visabestimmungen/MB__schengen__en__jan09,property=Daten.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.manila.diplo.de/Vertretung/ma...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_159/coming-to-france_2045/getting-visa_2046/how-do-i-apply-for-short-term-visa-on-an-ordinary-passport_10873.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/france_...</a>|`|cd455d62de3cf54cb4d8cfe1459717e9aa	Your question appears to make no sense.<br>  <br>  schengen,   what the hell is schengen ?

J2octzi5aa	no, en realidad nunca he sentido eso. <br>  mira, una vez de acapulco a mexico me fui en un boeing 757 y el avion hacía con el viento las alas como pájaro, se movian mucho y parecia que se iban a romper. cuando le pregunté a un ingeniero aeronautico me contestó que eso es parte del dise?o, al hacer las alas mas flexibles era menos probable que estas se pudieran romper, además que el movimiento de las alas absorve los movimientos de las turbulencias permitiendo un viaje mas placentero.<br>  <br>  se me hace mas fragil el auto y el autobus.<br>  <br>  recuerda que el avión es el medio de transporte mas seguro del mundo.<br>  <br>  saludos|`|219bc811da8695ecb80179e4b64b4dc1aa	claro que no al contrario me maravilla pensar en como un armatoste tan grande y pesado puede volar tan ligerito, ademas siempre que viajo trato de no pensar en nada malo me gusta disfrutar del vuelo.|`|94a7b1c5bc483b8948e793e7256c5e58aa	No al contrario, siento que voy en un armatoste tremendo y si hay turbulencia, pienso en el fregazo que me voy a dar, precisamente por lo grandote del dichoso aparato,  no hay manera de brincar, jeje.<br>  Saludos|`|jm6bt1slaa	Así es.... pero a la vez es sorprendente, yo soy sobrecargo, mi vida esta en los aviones, y te digo que a pesar que se científicamente el funcionamiento, no deja de asombrarme como un monstruo de esa magnitud puede sostenerse en el aire..... gran invento de la tecnología... suerte!|`|5e2b49a092457c386da3d9bf1fd3639aaa	si ,porque con la velocidad que lleva ,cualquier choque con el suelo le hará pedazos.|`|d15e5ef351aa8ba302990d0e342f683baa	yo lo paso maaalll, tengo fobia a los aviones, asi que te imaginaras, si es tremendamente fragil.|`|7a321470e4ab087e034e8361691582b2aa	dios esa es mi fobia|`|640bdb55ccc56a7df4ec1734e28bf237aa	Sí, pero procuro no pensar en ello cuando lo hago.

219bc811da8695ecb80179e4b64b4dc1aa	mira lo del costo del boleto yo diria que mejor lo averigues en una agencia de viajes de tu localidad, asi le explicas a la persona que te atienda que es lo quieres y entonces ya te arman tu paquete.  en cuanto al dinero que se necesitaria para estar en cancun yo por experiencia propia te digo que las veces que hemos ido (septiembre pasado fue la ultima vez) siempre destinamos 100 dlls diarios, claro haya dias que no te los gastas pero tambien hay dias que te gastas mas. yo te recomendaria tambien que si puedes vayas pagando algunos de los paseos que se ofrecen como por ejemplo a Xcaret y a Xelha, compralos con todo  incluido   ( transportacion ida y vuelta y alimentos) por internet y te salen un 10 % mas baratos  y asi tambien te quitas gastos para cuando ya estes en cancun (el paseo de Xelha que incluya tambien Tulum ya que como los dos lugares son peque?os aprovechas y los visitas los dos en el mismo dia, en la manana las piramides y ya despues del medio dia el parque ecologico y asi te sale mas barato ) bueno eso seria todo espero que disfrutes tu estancia en el bello cancun|`|UZeqfxsxaa	Los tiquetes te saldrían así, si sales desde Caracas, sería con la aerolínea COPA Caracas, Panamá, Cancun y el regreso igual, te sale en 804.58 dolares, sino con la aerolínea MEXICANA con la ruta Caracas, Mexico, Cancun te sale en 829.39 dolares. Esto es tarifa de aeropuerto y es un poco mas cara.|`|jm6bt1slaa	depende..... en que aerolínea quieres viajar.... y si vas en temporada alta el costo sube hasta un 25%.... por lo regular en temporada normal esta un boleto a cancun en 3,500 pesos viaje redondo, porque cancun tiene mucha demanda y el costo es mas elevado, y un boleto a Venezuela esta como en 4,500 pesos... suerte!
ngo56uKZaa	yo lei mucho sobre el tema y no es totalmente un fraude aunque tampoco es tan maravilloso como te lo prometen, si quieres el paquete solo para tomarte las vacaciones tienes que estar dispuesto a tomarte solo en los períodos que ellos te ofrecen y a los lugares que tienen disponible , o sea para los que tenemos pocos dias de vacaciones rara vez podremos disfrutar de alguno de sus hoteles y cruceros, ademas estos no son completamente gratis como dicen sino que te cobran impuestos y otros cargos, y esta pensado para gente de los estados unidos pero para mi pais ( Argentina ) no conviene. Y es cierto lo que dices, lo que ofrecen estos paquetes con tal de venderlos dicen cualquier cosa .|`|7RMV35Uqaa	la verdad no puedo asegurar que sean un fraude pero yo no compraría un paquete vacacional por internet, utilizarìa otros medios, por si las dudas.|`|I7DfrD6Naa	no te fies,ya q ante todo tienes q informarte bien ...hay gente muy lista q sabe como hacerse con el dinero de los demas..!!!!!!!!!!cuando estes seguro q sea de tu pais y con toda la seguridad|`|5ad6ac224b687399a3bcd8c9704cd2ffaa	No tienen por que serlo.

5495b688f64b9cac8a688962edc9f8e7aa	Talvez creas que mi respuesta, esta fuera de tu pregunta pero consideralo, como un bosquejo de un amigo, de un buen amigo....<br>  <br>  Siempre corri de aqui para alla, (trabajo);  queria hacer esto y tambien lo otro, y por supuesto aquello, terminaba tan cansado que queria, unas vacaciones (cualquier playa, con tal estuviera tranquilo), llego el momento donde tuve la oportunidad, tardo por la presion del trabajo pero llego, y le dije a mi gente vamonos.....    Pero ya cuando salia me sente y pense  ?trabajo tanto y para que?  para darle un futuro a mi familia?  si nisiquiera paso con ellos,  entonces pense la gente que vive cerca de la playa quiere venir al centro de la cuidad y alejarse de la costa para venir a un centro comercial de la ciudad, pero los que estamos aqui estamos hartos de ella,  quien entiende al mundo y como piensan sus habitantes,  y le dije familia cambiaron los planes, no nos iremos a la playa, azaremos carne, nos reiremos un poco, hasta el cansancio, jugaremos y seremos por hoy una familia que disfruta las vacaciones, juntos...  porque no es la playa quien hace las vacaciones;  sino una familia feliz, que solo desea estar juntos y no importa donde...<br>  <br>  Posdata.<br>  No te digo que no salgas, solo digo que disfrutes tu familia, te olvides del presupuesto, y pases un buen tiempo con ellos.<br>  Humildemente, un consejo de amigo.<br>  Natan Abimelec Rodriguez<br>  !!que disfrutes tus vacaciones, al lado de los que amas!!|`|ZAckFjSraa	cancun , nada mas con verla puedes ir y regresar y te va a quedar la imagen de los colores de ese mar toda la vida.|`|jm6bt1slaa	Bueno, un voleto de avion a cancvun es de 3500 aprox p/p, y la estancia ahi es mas caro....

C'est un pays très beau et les égyptiens sont si accueillants. <br>  <br>  Il y a les grandes pyramides de Gizah, la delte de la plus longue rivière du monde, la Méditerranée, la Mer Rouge, le canal de Suez, Sharm el sheik, Hurghada, le mont Sinai (plus de 2600 m) et bien d'autres attraits touristiques. <br>  <br>  C'est d'ailleurs le pays le plus peuplé des pays arabes et le Caire est une capitale fascinante avec plus de 13 millions d'habitants. <br>  <br>  J'adore l'Egypte. <br>  <br>  Bon voyage!<br>  <br>  <br>  PS: Ce n'est pas un pays pauvre, c'est un pays en cours de développement.|`|QBBrp8Cuaa	bah j'ais bien été en Amérique pendans 2 semaines   dans 14 Hotels différents (parcourus presque tout le pays  mème passé dans le désert de la mort)<br>  <br>  tout cela avec une voiture Géniale  (Pontiac grand prix)<br>  <br>  et comme tu le vois  je suis toujours la  ;)|`|X0VOQ699aa	Il ne faut pas abuser l'Egypte n'est pas un pays TRèS PAUVRE comme tu le dis il y a beaucoup de villes riches voir luxueuse et qui ne sont pas pour autant touristique.<br>  Je pense que je suis bien placé pour le dire!<br>  Et pour ton rêve je ne l'ai jamais fait mais moi j'ivai chaque été 2 mois et pas en tant que touriste.|`|zSW8VXBaaa	oui j'aimerai bien le faire ce voyage|`|mbLq2ZO1aa	Moi mon rêve, ?a serait d'aller en Egypte en hotel 5 étoiles et avoir un chameau privé qui comprenne le fran?ais pour m'emmener là où je désire ...|`|a90da09ef432e2d1873d57479397c8b9aa	Moi aussi !

lPFyChjjaa	Hola<br>  yo creo que antes de pensar en viajar por el mundo para conocerlo, pensaría haría primero que conocer el mio de cabo a rabo, mis país es un tanto grande y me siento dichosa de vivir aquí, hay tantos sitios que conocer, primero no necesitas ir por ejemplo para Aruba para disfrutar de buenas playas, tenemos margarita, ocumare, chorini, que son reconocidas internacionalmente, si quiero un poco de frió, me voy a merida a visitar los pico bolívar y espejo para disfrutar de las nieve, si lo que quiero es disfrutar del desierto y meterme en un oasis, voy a los medanos de coco, Venezuela lo tiene todo en parajes turísticos por eso digo y pienso que de todo los sitios que conozco el que mas quiero es a Venezuela mi país.....|`|7CptnwiJaa	xcaret me fascina suerte..................|`|jm6bt1slaa	Me encanto...Italia..

rgPyCgXoaa	I went to France for 9 days in 2004 and it was also $2500, included the same things. So yeah, it's a good deal.  And I don't think it's weird that she's doing it and not the school. I think it's because a lot of liability would fall on the school and you all would have to pay more for insurance purposes if the school was coordinating.  As long as besides the chaperons it's only students going, it will probably be totally fine.  So yeah, it's a great deal. I would definitely go, when I went it was one of the best experiences of my life!  Check out my pictures from when I went in '04:  http://audrizzle.com/photo/04-0326france    Anyway, I hope you raise the money and all goes well. Have fun!|`|IduItEH9aa	The price sounds really good. The airfare alone would be about $1000.    No, I don't think it's weird. It sounds like she's a great teacher.  Just because she's coordinating the trip doesn't mean the school is not on board and doesn't agree with it.  She wouldn't be able to announce this trip in school without the approval of the principal.    Don't forget to get a passport!    I'm a bit jealous myself! Wish I could go!|`|AA10640608	The price sounds fair for 10 days. The dollar is so low right now against the Euro and France is expensive anyway.  My daughters have had teachers coordinate trips without school sponsorship so, no I don't think it's weird. Some teachers just enjoy showing students new things & places (teaching!).  |`|m8mSBhZZaa	Yes I think it does|`|AA11945637	sounds good|`|AA11373993	1. The price is going to be a little high during the Summer, so yeah that's reasonable  2.All language teachers do this and sponsor it on their own. So no that's not weird.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	very reasonable at that price. and yes maybe she thinks the older students will watch after the ypounger students and i ams sure there will be more chaparones coming like her husband/bf and possibley a school admindistater and spouse|`|9Hiu52aNaa	yes i did it for more|`|732c93f221398a8118ade340f2e7c887aa	well its not weird because the school wouldnt even sujest a thig like that and the price seems ok |`|sEDgn2Goaa	Well, it depends.. Do you live close to france?    EDIT; Oh okay then. That price sounds reasonable. :) You should go... Have fun|`|cYisWl4uaa	its sounds like a great price. i'm going to Disney world in florida, for choir about that price. and I don't think it sounds weird. the teacher cares about teaching you and she want to give you a good experience. My french teacher did the same thing last year.|`|5f0s07Mxaa	I think it all sounds pretty decent - in fact, my school does almost the exact same thing. The price seems certainly fair, especially with all the financial and economical funkiness going on at the moment - not to mention that it covers pretty much everything, which is impressive. As for your teacher coordinating it on her own, no that doesn't sound too bad. If she seems reliable and if there are other people going, I would worry. Again, this might actually be what my old French teacher used to do as well. It might be too much of a hassle to go through the whole process with the school.    All in all, I wouldn't worry. It doesn't sound like you're getting ripped off and if the teacher seems competent, the whole "not being a school related thing" isn't really an issue.
E3iIiOcRaa	no es que las veas mas lindas lo que pasa que si terminas borracho te empezas a calentar y si no te queda otra te vas a ir a lo que sobre osea los bagallitos, igualmente quien en su vida no se comio a uno? ademas tiene sus ventajas ya que suelen ser mas "gauchitas" es decir se dejan hacer o te hacen cosas que otras no te hace.

c57eb2355c0fe066a449984d45e7408faa	Buenos si vas a visitar Buenos Aires, hay millones de lugares que te recomiendo. Empezemos por la parte mas moderna y mas turística<br>  -Palermo: Esta a orillas del Plata y si llegas a aeroparque Jorge Newvery ya estas dentro de palermo. Cerca de allí tenes el hipódromo, donde si llegas en algún momento oportuno se realizan carreras de vez en cuando. Desde el aeroparque vas a llegar a ver el clasico skyline de Palermo, con la torre Le Parc como la mas alta. Debajo de estos rascacielos estan los jardines de Palermo algo que no te podé perder. Son como el Central Park para New York. Allí podés dar un entretenido paseo en bote o triciclo acuático por los lagos, pasar por hermosos puentes de marmol y hacer algún camping. Ahi nomas, dentro de los jardines tenés el rosedal que es casi uno de esos clásicos jardines de castillos medievales en los cuentos de hadas. Hay miles de clases de rosas para ver y sentir su aroma. <br>  Ahí nomas, mas a el sur tenes la avenida Figueroa Alcorta y su cruze con Cavia. En ese lugar se ubican las Torres Le Parc Figueroa Alcorta, las mas altas de Buenos Aires y frente a eso el shopping Paseo Alcorta que es excelente si tenes un buen presupuesto. <br>  Los jardines que se extienden hasta un lado de una peque?a monta?a sobre la cual pasa el tren, allí hay un buen museo de arte moderno que podés conocer. <br>  Un poco mas a la parte urbana, en la avenida Sarmiento tenés una de las atracciones principales: El zoo de Buenos Aires, que no podés dejar visitar. Ademas tenés los jardines botánicos con mas de 5000 especies de plantas. Por último en la zona esta el Planetario, que ?es espectacular!.<br>  Califico a Palermo como Imperdible!!!<br>  -San Telmo: Está mas al sudoeste que palermo y tiene atracciones que no son visita obligatoría pero podé visitarlas para llevarte algún recuerdo. En la plaza Dorrego tenés la feria artesanal que abre los domingos. Allí podés llevarte toda clase de souvenirs artesanales. Solo si te interesa la historia estaría bién visitar el museo de historia nacional.<br>  Califico a San Telmo como algo opcional y a gusto de uno<br>  -Puerto Madero: Es para los turistas que poseen algo mas de fondos. Se divide en cuatro colosales diques con puentes giratorios. Es el barrio mas moderno de toda la ciudad y es espectacular de noche. Allí podés ver la hermosa Fragata Sarmiento, es la fragata original, no una copia. Podes recorrerla de proa a popa y podes llegar hasta el cuarto de máquinas. En el mismo barrio también hay múltiples peatonales y dos grandes parques de nombre Mujeres Argentinas y Micaela Bastidas. <br>  También tenes la reserva ecológica que es bastante grande y se pueda observar algo de la fauna y la flora original de la zona. Ademas de la fragata está la Corbeta Uruguay, la nave a flote mas antigua del mundo. Podes visitarla por dentro tambiés. Ademas podes ver y cruzar el extra?o y fantástico puente de la mujer que atraviesa el dique 3.<br>  Califico a Puerto Madero como de visita obligatoria especialmente de noche.<br>  -La Boca: La Boca es un barrio antiguo que se creó por la gran cantidad de inmigrantes llegados al pais. Estos se asentaron en viviendas coloridad de nombre conventillos. Una gran parte de estos siguen en pie en la actualidad. Caminito es la visita obligatoria e imperdible cuando vas a Buenos Aires. Alli podrás ver el Tango y conocer una calle clasica. Otra cosa en la boca que aunque no es de obligación ver resulta interesante, es el puente transbordador que une la ciudad de Buenos Aires con su area metropolitana. Ademas tenés la feria artesanal de la Vuelta de Rocha y el Museo Quinquela Martin. Para los fanáticos del football el estadio Boca Juniors (conocido como La Bombonera) es imperdible, debido a que el equipo, es el que posee la mayor cantidad de titulos internacionales del mundo.<br>  Califico a la boca como importante. El punto mas importante que siempre debe ser visto es Caminito.<br>  -Plaza de Mayo: Es impresionante. Resulta muy limpia y muy bella tanto para el turista como para el residente. Allí se ubican parte de las principales entidades de gobierno. La Casa Rosada donde reside el presidente es excelente para ver y tomar fotografías. El cabildo es un monumento historico y se puede visitar por dentro, data del a?o 1600. Ademas está la catedral de Buenos Aires una de las mas grandes del mundo.<br>  Califico a la plaza de mayo como imperdible!!!<br>  -Centro de la ciudad: Es algo que obligatoriamente para los turistas debe ser visto. Posee la avenida mas ancha del mundo, la famosa 9 de Julio y allí se ubica el obelisco simbolo de la ciudad. En la esquina del obelisco se ubica la calle corrientes donde estan los teatros mas importantes de la ciudad.<br>  Tambiés se puede ver el teatro colón (Opera de Buenos Aires) que en este momento no es accedible por los trabajos de refacción pero se lo puede fotografira. También esta la avenida de Mayo, la cual termina en el congreso que de noche se ve muy bién.<br>  Plaza San Martin es conveniente verla debido a su tama?o y la gran cantidad de cosas que encontraras a su alrrededor, tales como el Palacio San Martín.<br>  Otras cosas imperdibles son la calle florida, conocida por su activiadad nocturna y sus gigantescas librerías. Tambiés, el shopping galerías del Pacifico resulta muy pintoresco y atractivo.<br>  Califico al centro como Imperdible!!!<br>  -Retiro: Es el centro financiero de la ciudad, donde se ubican las sedes de las entidades bancarias y varios hoteles tales como el Sheraton Buenos Aires. Retiro es mejor visitarlo en auto, debido a que atravesarlo a pie, puede ser algo tedioso. Conviene deternerse a mirar el edificio Kavanagh, el mas alto de sudamérica y del mundo de hormigon armado en 1939. También podes ver la Torre Monumental o de los Ingleses, que fue donada por Inglaterra para celebrar el centenario de 1910.<br>  Califico a Retiro como algo que no debe ser omitido en su visita a Buenos Aires<br>  -Recoleta: Uno de los barrios mas importantes de la ciudad. Alli se reunían a rezar los fieles hace varios siglos. Es el hogar del cementerio de recoleta el mas relevante y lujoso de latinoamérica tanto por el tama?o de sus mausoleos o por la estirpe que allí descanza. Tambiés aparece en los itinerarios el museo de Bellas Artes del pais, donde se encuentran obras de artistas que van  desde Rembrandt y Rubens a Pollock y Rothko, Tiépolo, Greco, Goya, Rodin, Manet, Monet, Van Gogh, Degas, De Chirico, Kandinsky, Picasso, Tàpies. Arte argentino: Cándido López, Morel, Pueyrredón, de la Cárcova, Sívori, Malharro, Fader, Guttero, Curatella Manes, Petorutti, Quinquela Martín, Berni, Spilimbergo, Deira, Distéfano, Alonso, Benedit y Seguí, entre otros. Floralis Generica es uno de los simbolos porte?os mas importantes, y consiste de una flor de dimensiones gigantescas con cuatro pétalos que pesan 4 toneladas cada uno. De dia esta abierta y se cierra de noche dando un resplandor interior rojizo. Por último, si te gustan los cines y restaurantes, tenés el complejo Village.<br>  Califico a Recoleta como importante.<br>  <br>  Esos lugares se ubican dentro de la ciudad de Buenos Aires, y es la principal area turística. Ahora vamos a seguir la ribera del Rio de la Plata mas al norte. Zona norte ofrece dos areas importantes, San Isidro y Tigre, en el delta. Ambas unidas por el tren de la costa el mas avanzado tecnologicamente del pais. El Tigre podes dar paseos en Buquebus a la isla martin garcia o dar paseos en catamarán. También se puede visitar la estación Fluvial y el paseo Victoria a lo largo de la costa. También en la última estación del tren de la costa, tenés el parque de diversiones Parque de la Costa que es imperdible y podes visitarlo todos los dias. <br>  San Isidro ofrece como atracciones principales, la quinta de Pueyrredon, un ex-caudillo de Buenos Aires y su catedral de estilo neo-gótico.<br>  Si te atreves a bajar al sur de la provincia (4 hrs de viaje aprox.) llegaras a San Clemente del Tuyú donde podras apreciar un espectacular atardecer en el mar y el faro San Antonio en Punta Rasa, donde el Rio de La Plata limita con el Oceano Atlantico. Ademas podrás visitar el Oceanario mas grande de Sudamérica de nombre Mundo Marino y las termas de la ciudad. Ma a el sur esta la espectacular Mar del Plata que nunca (si te es posible) dejes de visitarla. Es la ciudad resort maritima mas importante del pais y una de las mas importantes de américa, solo comparable con Rio, Vi?a del Mar, Punta del Este, la Gold Coast australiana, Miami entre otras. La ciudad posee una espectacular infraestructura úrbana y uno se siente muy bién cuando va bajando por las avenidas hacia el mar, debido a que estas se encuantran en caida hacia las playas. Alli se puede ver toda la extensión del oceano y las playas. Por último para no decirte mas de lo necesario, vos querias saber de la Pampa, te cuento que lo ideal para visitar en la provincia son las estancias y la ciudad de Santa Rosa, con sus múltples campings y parques. Algo mas lejos estan las Termas de Larroude, que atraen a miles de turistas. Finalmente tenés el protegido bosque de caldenes que no podés dejar de visitar|`|1KIOHiBNaa	bueno... en capital ya te dijeron...<br>  <br>  alrededores?? el tigre y su delta y el parque de la costa (muy lindo), en san clemente del tuyu hay aguas termales y esta mundo marino!!, tambien podes ir por las localidades de la costa hasta llegar a mar del plata!! que es una ciudad donde tenes muchisimo para hacer!!|`|6Rd9P69Maa	Hay muchos lugares, Puerto Madero, Palermo, Las Barrancas de San Isidro, El Obelisco, El Cabildo, Escobar, El Jardin Japonés, El Zoologico, Parque de La Costa, Unicenter Shopping y decenas de Shopping mas.

T93YCfDRaa	Express buses (116E) run Monday to Friday from the Kennedy subway station via Eglinton Avenue to the campus from 6:20am to 9:20am and from the campus to Kennedy station from 4:19pm to 6:59pm. At other times, the Kennedy (116) provides regular service along this route. <br>  <br>  A new trial service, called the 38 Highland Creek between Scarborough Centre Station (from the RT) to the Rouge Hill Go station via the University of Toronto at Scarborough, will be introduced on September 5, 2000. This pilot service was developed by TTC in consultation with representatives from UTSC with the aim to provide the UTSC community with a direct connection to the Scarborough Centre Station and reduce the number of transfers for users. <br>  <br>  The new 38 Highland Creek route will replace part of the present 95 York Mills route and will run every 11 to 12 minutes during peak periods, and every 15 to 20 minutes at off-peak times. Service will be provided from approx. 6:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m., Monday to Saturday. <br>  <br>  There is no change to the 116E Morningside Express service which will continue to connect the campus to the Kennedy Station. <br>  <br>  In summary, buses serving UTSC directly: <br>  <br>  38 Highland Creek, Monday - Saturday, approximately 6:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. <br>  95E York Mills Express, Monday - Friday, 6-9:00 a.m. and 3-7:00 p.m. <br>  95B York Mills, Monday - Friday, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 7-10:00 p.m. <br>  116E Morningside Express, Monday - Friday, 6-9:00 a.m. and 3-7:00 p.m. <br>  Buses will also continue to connect indirectly to the campus via Ellesmere Rd as follows: <br>  The level of service at all stops along the route will be approximately the same as it is now, except that stops along Ellesmere Rd between the University of Toronto at Scarborough and McCowan Road will have more frequent service with the addition of the 38 Highland Creek route. Destination signs:<br>  <br>  95 YORK MILLS / TO KINGSTON RD <br>  95A YORK MILLS / TO VICTORIA PARK <br>  95B YORK MILLS / TO U of T SCARBOROUGH <br>  95E YORK MILLS EXPRESS / TO U of T SCARBOROUGH <br>  95 YORK MILLS / TO YORK MILLS STN <br>  95 YORK MILLS / TO YORK MILLS STN <br>  95 YORK MILLS / TO YORK MILLS STN <br>  95E YORK MILLS EXPRESS / TO YORK MILLS STN<br>  <br>  So if you're from spadina station, take the subway eastbound to Kennedy station. From there you can take the buses listed above. You can take it from Scarborough town centre as well which requires you to transfer onto the RT from Kennedy station but I don't see a need to.

6i53RN5jaa	You shouldn't worry that much on food expenditure. If your rented room is located in a matured neighbourhood, you could find food centres selling inexpensive food and could well be spending $2-$2.50 or less for each meal. Transportation cost should be taken into consideration. Say a 2 train rides and 2 bus transfers a day will cost you approximately $4.50 per day. Electricity bills are going to be on the rise again. |`|ORd4bZdAaa	As far my experience;a person can easily have Good Breakfast for 3$, Lunch from 3-5 $ and Dinner 3-5$.

a4fdffa57f30442c8d9c2d6391d78f4baa	All PO Box applications are dealt with by Royal Mail's offices in Salford, Manchester. You can't do it in a Post Office branch. You'll also have to send them proof that you live at the address that you want the PO Box mail forwarded to. Call 08457 950 950 and ask for the PO Box Team.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|4Ej32YBfaa	Postie here - Sorry as with most very large organizations there is a set way of doing things and the local office is not allowed to start a PO Box without being informed by the correct department.

qXQa06bAaa	If you've got a decent printer hooked up to your computer, just use printed postage, it's alot easier..... no need for stamps.... fill in the necessary blurb online, pay for it, download a pdf file the Royal Mail website creates, and print it onto the envelope... then stick it in a postbox.<br>  Or just write "AirMail" in the top left corner of the envelope, and take it to your local post office counter (if it hasn't been closed down), and they'll sort it out for you.|`|AA11220909	One 1st class and one 2nd class will do it - that's what I put on mine with no trouble.|`|4Ej32YBfaa	Postie here all the questions have been answered but yes you can use a first class stamp and then various stamps of different face values to make the difference up.  Our you could just purchase face value stamps from the PO.<br>  <br>  However, did you know that the RM 1st class and 2nd Class stamps are "forever" stamps - once you purchase them they will cover the cost of sending a letter until cancelled.  So if you buy 12 1st class stamps now at 34p each but don't use them for 10 years they will still cover the price of sending a 1st class letter in 2018 even if the price of a new stamp is 60p.  You can't do that with Aussie stamps.|`|AZErtytoaa	The normal letter would be 81 pence - 56 pence would be one sheet of writing paper . ANY Post Office will sell you  a stamp with those face values . 1st Class stamps ( 36 pence ) and second class ( 27 pence) are primarily for internal UK Mail - the terms First and Second Class apply only to internal UK mail  . Quite logical! You can use the stamps based on face value posting abroad but to cover the cost you would be paying over the odds .  |`|aqLLbzJQaa	A 56p stamp is worth 56p - your local post office will sell you one 56p stamp if thats what you need.  All stamps are in currency amounts - they come in a complete range from 1p all the way up to ￡5, it is only the common 1st and 2nd class stamps which do not have a value printed on them, for your records the current value of a 1st class stamp is 36p and 2nd class is 27p.<br>  <br>  <br>  ....|`|AA10837912	Depends on the weight of the package, and size|`|c3b9681ac35eb7ed342673df01b650d4aa	I think they give you like one 1st Class stamp plus however many 2nd Class stamps to make up the rest of the balance.<br>  <br>  It all depends on weight too - take it to the post office and they'll advise.

LiItrPvraa	I have to agree with Elizabeth.    The few Greeks I know with the dual citizenship are indeed very scheming people.  All of them collecting dole, disability pensions (even if they healthy as anything) or earning money by work.    But none of them - as far as I know, will honestly show to the Tax-man the real income they do receive (from business and properties in Greece).  The AUS government is trying hard to catch those who are cheating the system and going to holiday in Greece every year just to collect their profits from there.    It is but Catch 21.  A mission impossible.    The people of Greek origin are indeed to smart for the English thinking bureaucrats.    It is but nothing to be proud of.|`|LMo8HaA2aa	Well, without having read the details of your question, I say: DEFINITELY YES.  I can't see where is the problem.   Who would deny the role of this diaspora to the construction of the Modern Greek State?    Oh, now I've read about the houses of Greeks from Australia.  Yes, also true, but not to such an extend.   Let me say that my parents, who lived and worked in Greece, have 6 houses (for EXAMPLE), whereas my aunts and uncles that came from Germany those last years, just 'don't know what they have'.   I hope you understood.      They are not 7.000.000, they are much more, 10 to 12.000.000.     Oh, no! They left us nothing, it is just that those Greeks who migrated abroad (Germany, Sweden, USA) have a considerably larger financial ...potential than Greeks that lived in Greece. They have the necessary money to start a business (hotel for example) when they get back to Greece (if they get back).|`|AA11589437	Not in the aspect you mention, ie housing,, because the houses that the emigrants left behind in the 50's and 60's are usually some ruined old buildings in their villages that have been left abandoned or demolished. Those who left back then were poor people, who had the will to go forward, but nothing much to leave behind.    They did help their families financially, though. I am not ungrateful to my uncle who was a Professor in Canada and left me part of his fortune, which is a considerable help for me. But to be clear, he left me some of the fortune he made in Canada in all his life, he had nothing to leave to anyone when he left from Greece.|`|GfmlxtNtaa	yes my house is the house my hushands granfather build with his own hands, his parents lived here for little then moved to athens, when my hushnad grew up he moved back here.  i think its nice.|`|wYRP2mZuaa	If it wouldn't be for their ancestors who left overseas they would be poorer then the country of Albania or Moldova.

Say hello to Tigress from me Platypuss.|`|z15RhXfjaa	Well I am from England and have been living in Greece for 7 years now, my fiancee is Greek.    The Greeks are behind other countries with regards to development of houing, so there are still many fields here, which are owned by families which are now just being sold off for housing.    And yes you are right, the greeks went abroad in the past, australia, England etc etc and earned money and sent it back to the families who brought houses and started businesses with it.    The families are close here, so the whole family will work together to get their children houses.    They will sell the field to a housing constructor (builder) or keep two of the houses and give the housing constructor the rest of the houses (this means they dont have to pay for the houses to be constructed).    They then will either rent or sell these houses and buy their children houses.    There is also many greeks involved in the family business, and the parents will give their children everything.    This has been going on for many generations so the parents of the children now, were given houses by their parents etc etc all coming from their one plot of land which originally was given to them free by the government.    I live in a city here (thessaloniki), and the fields which in the past were given to the farmers for free, are now being sold off for millions and the grandparents are giving their grandchildren all the money.    The tax system here is nothing less than dodgy so the Greeks find many ways to get out of paying taxes. they blatently lie about it and nothing ever gets done, so they benefit a lot from that also.    The greeks are great at doing whatever it takes to get money, lie, cheat, and sometimes steal. Its an everyday thing here, and not thought of as being bad or low. To them its who can blag the most wins!!!    Also imagine having a business through the ages where you never had to pay anyone any wages as they were all your family!!! Thats how the Greeks work!!! The children will work long hours for minimum pay, and the parents will invest all the money in properties, etc for the kids when they are older.    So you see its a joint effort, the whole family is working to get the kids houses by any means necessary!
Q3kLsH1waa	yes, because you will be traveling with an American passport. Visas: From the US , for US citizens you don't have to have any special visa ( you get a "tourist visa") to stay as a tourist for up to 90 days. They give you a piece of paper ( a form) on the plane or ship and that's about it. But don't lose your copy of that form, they take it back from you on the way out of Chile and if you don't have your copy it kind of fouls up their system and they frown a lot. For other countries/citizens contact your airline or travel agent. IMPORTANT, show this visa at hotels and you avoid the 18% IVA sales tax. Also important for US, Australian, Mexican and Canadian citizens. They pay a one time entrance tax when they arrive in Chile, one time in the sense that it is good as long you use the same passport to enter Chile. This is reciprocal, the amount charged is the amount those respective countries charge Chileans for a visa! <br>  USA US$ 130

gjZEGSS3aa	Canada Day, July 1, celebrates the British North America Act of 1867, which granted the Canadians home rule. The BNA Act created the Dominion of Canada by uniting the Province of Canada (modern Ontario and Quebec), the province of New Brunswick, and the province of Nova Scotia. Home rule was not absolute; the Dominion got its own Parliament, but its decisions still needed to be affirmed by the U.K. Parliament. Manitoba joined the Dominion in 1870, followed by British Columbia (1871), Prince Edward Island (1873), and Saskatchewan and Alberta (1905). Newfoundland and Labrador gave up its own claim to nationhood to join Canada in 1949. (The Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon remain territories, not full provinces.)<br>  <br>  The Statute of Westminster, in 1931, finally removed the U.K. Parliament from Canada's legislative process. It was not until the Canada Act of 1982, however, that the U.K. relinquished its authority to amend the British North America Act (then renamed the Canada Act). Theoretically, then, until 1982 the U.K. could have said, "Sorry, just kidding -- we're repealing the BNA, you have to go through us now."<br>  <br>  Canada maintains strong ties to its mother country. Queen Elizabeth is still the Queen and head of state under Canada's constitution, and a Governor General (currently Michaelle Jean, a Haitian-born woman) represents the Crown in Canada. Canada is also still a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, a group of 53 countries with historical or constitutional ties to the former British Empire.|`|0fc71d93282bf1baaa4cd5f250fd7a07aa	Nope Canada is an independent country in North America.Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and is the only independent country in mainland North America having a monarch the British sovereign is Canada's symbolic head of state.|`|BpxDSiOHaa	Canada rules itself, but we are part of the British Commonwealth.

No bill can be passed into law in Canada without receiving the Queens consent.  No new session of Parliament can be opened without a Throne Speech which is written by the Government of the Day and read by the Queen's representative in Canada, the Governor General.  <br>  <br>  Canada hasn't "belonged" to the UK for a long time now but as you can see we still have close historical and practical ties to England and to the rest of the countries of the Commonwealth.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	Not since 1867.

The Greensboro metro area is pretty sprawling and extends pretty far east and west of downtown.  Also, I40/I85 can be very challenging at rush hour.  If you can avoid rush hour, and live and work close to the interstate you can expect your commute to be under an hour which is reasonable in many areas of the country.    Other places to consider living are Burlington and Pittsboro.  Both of these are popular places that are convenient to Greensboro and Chapel Hill.|`|HESpmdqAaa	dude its about an hr and a half....... too much driving just to be close to friends.... but....

9QBlKlFmaa	The issue is not all that simple.<br>  <br>  There is a principle that a Jew remains a Jew no matter what his sin may be.  If he steals or bears false witness, he is a bad Jew, but he is still Jewish.<br>  <br>  The issue of belief in Jebus is not so clear and really depends on whether he knows what he is doing or does not.<br>  <br>  A Jew who consciously believes in Jebus as the messiah, understanding that Judaism utterly rejects such a belief, has gone over the hill and is no longer Jewish.  The converse -- if he unwittingly accepted such a belief without being aware of the consequences -- in that case he remains a Jewish sinner.<br>  <br>  Forget about the bloodline reference.  One can be Jewish by undergoing valid conversion in accordance with Jewish Law.  Even if one's parents have no "Jewish blood."<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .<br>  .|`|bmhnXEsVaa	The name "Judah" from which the term "Jew" comes from means "one who praises". The Jewish people were created to reveal G-d & to bring praise to Him. This is their purpose on earth. King David, who was from the tribe of Judah clearly demonstrated this when he erected a tabernacle to G-d. Scripture states he sat before the L-rd, yet he was neither a priest nor a Levite, which were 2 of the essential prerequisites to access the divine Presence of G-d. G-d received the praises of King David & granted his lineage honor. This is a clear Scriptural example of how the Jews are called to bring praise to G-d. <br>  When King Saul disobeyed the commands & allowed pride to move him to sacrifice, I believe he lost his status of 'praiser of G-d' because he was seeking praise for himself. While it does not say this in Scripture, we see the clear evidence that G-d removed the throne from Saul's' lineage. I believe when a Jew places "self" on the throne of their heart & chooses to live for their own ways instead of in a way that would bring honor & praise to G-d, they have ceased from their original purpose & have abandoned their identity as a Jew.|`|AA12245463	Oh, I don't know.  Probably in much the same way a Christian becomes an ex-Christian.<br>  <br>  Why would any Jew who leaves Judaism WANT to call himself a Jew?  He knows that he no longer has any status as a Jew and can no longer participate in any of the honors accorded Jews.  If he converts to another religion, he would be proud to call himself Christian, Hindus, Buddhist, etc.<br>  <br>  "A person is a Jew if they are bloodline decedents (sic) of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and one on the 12 tribes."  WRONG!  Being a Jew has nothing whatsoever to do with a bloodline or DNA!  Jewish tribes descend from the father.  The only tribe we can identify today is the tribe of Levi, including the priests.  Levites are identifiable from the father's name (Levi, Levine, Levy, etc.).  The descendants of Aaron are priests, identified by derivitives of the name Kohen (Cohen, Cohn, Kohane, etc.).  Does an adopted child assume the name of his adoptive father.  Yes, of course.  Does the child share the same bloodline?  Obviously NOT.<br>  <br>  A Kohen or a Levite is not always a Jew. If he was not born to a Jewish mother, he is not Jewish.  The only way that child could become a Jew is through conversion which does NOT involve a bloodline!<br>  <br>  We are not a race.  We are a family/community including MANY adopted members.  One of the most famous is David's grandmother, Ruth.  Perhaps you remember her famous lines, "I will go where you go, your people will be my people."<br>  .|`|6093550b9308429b874e5a267fb27439aa	Once a Jew, always a Jew, whether born as such or converted.<br>  <br>  No heresy, apostasy, or intermarriage changes that situation.<br>  <br>  A Jew who believes in a false religion is a traitor to his people and to God, but he is still a Jew.|`|i7oHTo9haa	Lando is right, Miron is right.

I like to explain it like this. That group you mentioned is just pretending to be Jewish as 99% are Christians who were never Jewish and I think they do it purposely just to create ruckus and chaos and a fight If people do that then nobody knows "who's who" in this world but they didn't take into account the next world to come and that I know who's who now. So they think they can get away with it. But their plan backfires on them sooner or later and for now it's sooner because you've just been "outed."<br>  <br>  These Messianics are totally conflicting with Judaism. It is better to be a righteous gentile and walk in the front door than to be a gentile trying to slip in the back or side door. We're watching all the doors and everyone is invited it's a great party in here I know!! So no need to try to crash into Judaism by a side or back door (it's just very sneaky and not very righteous.) We turn people away for trying to do that.<br>  <br>  It's much better to be a straight up Christian or a Noahide than it is to be a Messianic.

Once a Jew always a Jew... as one of The True Christian Faith I would make a comment... While those of us of The Faith know that there is only One Way for anyone to come to God... we, as True Christians still must stand with The Nation of Israel(all True Jews), even though we may have political differences with the political state of Israel. No True Christian is, in any way, anti semitic... that would be to act against G-D... There are True Christians who, in their desire to honor G-D, do keep many of the laws and "traditions" of Judaism... but in so doing they should not in any way make any claim. or act, that would make any one think they were Jews.<br>  <br>  There are some who claim to be Christian, as mentioned by some above, that do claim to be Jews and to be "the new Israel"... there is NOTHING in The Word of God to justify such claims...<br>  <br>  personaly... I just do not have the will to keep kosher... and there are just too many Holy Days to keep up with... but, while I disagree with both Jews and Christians who keep strictly to The Law and Tradition of The Nation of Israel... if they do so to The Glory of G-D... then they have my respect in their commitment.<br>  <br>  A long time ago I spent a summer in Israel... I was not a Christian then... I was not that interested in the "religious" history of the land... much more interested in more worldly pursuits.... I would very much like to go back and visit those places I "passed by"... I think I, as now a Christain, would be made just as welcome as I was many years ago.<br>  <br>  To Kibbutz Yad Hanna...

No matter what you believe religiously, your bloodline cannot be reversed or adjusted.  I even have a friend who is a Jehovah Witness who was originally Jewish, and he cannot deny his heritage.  When the fascists come to take us away, we can protest all we want that we are Christian, to no avail. <br>  <br>  There is a story in the book called "The Source", by James Michener of the ancient Olympic games that the Jews were allowed to participate in but they had to be naked during the competition.  One Jewish athlete named Menelaus had a de-circumcised operation in order to compete.  When his father saw him, he killed his own son.  I would not do the same to my kid, but I understand the message.<br>  <br>  Look, if you found G-d through Jesus, more power to you.  But we are the original and there is no reason for a Jew to believe in Jesus because we already believed in G-d many years before he arrived.  <br>  <br>  If you love Israel and want to live there, what's stopping you?  Israel needs all the righteous people it can get whether Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, etc.|`|fjidmhxsaa	Its not as easy as one may think.<br>  <br>  Nothing can change a Jew's status - not even conversion to another religion.

The leader of Chabad Lubavitch orthodox Jewish group Menachem Mendel Schneerson lobbied the Israeli government to define a Jew as "only one who is born of a Jewish mother or converted according to Halakha is Jewish." This upset foreign Reform and Conservative Jews, but I believe it is accepted law in Israel, even if it is not talked about openly. <br>  <br>   There was a Mosiach or Messiah fervor initiated by Chabad, promoting Jewishness in preparation for the arrival of the Jewish messiah. And after his death Chabad was promoting that Rabbi Schneerson was really the Jewish Messiah. <br>   <br>   Although this was not accepted by many Jews, who believe the Messiah will arrive very far in the future. The reason this belief in a messiah is not considered heresy and therefore making its believers non-Jewish is that Rabbi Schneerson did not want to change Jewish belief, but instead wanted to bring more Jews to an active and enthusiatic embrace of its more orthodox way of life. Clearly accepting a Messiah and staying Jewish seem to open the door to Christians also claiming to be Jews. This is seen as a threat to dilute the Jewishness. So Chabad refuses to talk to anyone who is not already Jewish and for have written several books explaining why Jesus was not the true Messiah.<br>   <br>   Christianity clearly set itself up in competition with Judaism by its embrace of gentiles and relaxing of the law of Moses. So even Christians who decide to follow all the orthodox laws of Moses are seen clearly a threat to Judaism, and as such for the survival of Judaism itself are not be encouraged to do this or considered Jewish in any way. Jewish children have the persecution of their people reinforced constantly throughout their education. As many of the perpetrators of the many of the atrocities committed on Jew were by people who called themselves Christians, there is a natural fear and suspicion of anyone who tries to convert them.<br>  <br>   As with all questions about Judaism there are many opinions. They say if there are two Jews arguing there are three opinions. If you want to know ask a Rabbi. If you don't like the answer ask another Rabbi. <br>  <br>   Personally I think only reason why a Messianic Jew who follows Jewish law and considers himself Jewish should not be considered a Jew, is Jewish rabbinical tradition which is based on fear of assimilation of Jews into an alien gentile culture. But if he was born Jewish i.e. of a Jewish mother - then whatever he believes in he is considered Jewish.|`|Me2oJOtAaa	Ok - let me put it like this. <br>  <br>  Im of Hungarian, Jewish, Roma, Irish and English descent. Thats my blood, my Dna - its the genetic make up I was born with and its the one Ill die with. Its a PHYSICAL  thing- and there is nothing that can change that regardless of what I do.  <br>  <br>  By jewish law - on a PHYSICAL level - im jewish because technically my mother and grandmother etc are. Their genes go all the way back to israel.<br>  <br>  Religiously - Im jewish. Judaism is defined by a certain set of beliefs and ritual.

Period.  They are Christians, many of whom, under false pretenses, aggressively seek to convert Jews and descendants of intermarriage to Christianity in a way that many of us find invasive, disrespectful, and anti-Semitic.<br>  <br>  Before I even get to what Jewish law says about these impostors, consider this:  not only does every Jewish organization completely reject them as Jewish, but so do a fair number of Christian groups (see links 2-4 below).<br>  If no Jew thinks that you’re Jewish, and even some Christians don’t, then how can you possibly think that you are?  And if one thinks that this rejection is a recent phenomenon, think again!  Even St. Ignatius, of the 2nd century, felt the same way!  In his Epistle to the Magnesians he wrote:<br>  <br>  “Never allow yourselves to be led astray by false teachings and antiquated and useless fables. Nothing of any use can be got from them. If we are still living in the practice of Judaism, it is an admission that we have failed to receive the gift of grace…To profess Jesus Christ while continuing to follow Jewish customs ***is an absurdity***…[L]et us learn to live like Christians. To profess any other name but that is to be lost to God…For where there is Christianity there cannot be Judaism.”<br>  <br>  And now for what **we** say:<br>  <br>  Most Jewish scholars agree that you cannot convert away from Judaism (there are a minority who say you can convert away). However, this by no means implies that a Jew who joins another religion has the same standing as a Jew who has remained Jewish. A Jew who practices another religion, whether it be Christianity (in any of its forms, including Messianic "Judaism"), Islam or anything else, is known as an "apostate." An apostate is someone who has removed themselves from the Jewish people by joining another faith. The apostate cannot be buried in a Jewish cemetery. Nor can the apostate be counted for a minyan, the minimum of ten adult Jews (or adult Jewish men, depending on one's denomination) needed for saying certain prayers. For nearly all practical purposes, they have the same status in the Jewish community as non-Jews. The only difference is that they do not have to undergo a full conversion to rejoin the Jewish community, though there is a process known as "Teshuvah" that they must go through to come back to the Jewish community with full Jewish status.<br>  <br>  So, once we delve into Jewish law we see that a Jew who joins another religion, though still Jewish, has ostensibly the status of a non-Jew and is no longer able to participate as a full member of the Jewish community. The apostate has the weakest of all grasps to their Jewish identity, they are Jewish by birth but otherwise have no position in the Jewish community.<br>  <br>  This then brings us to a discussion on the difference between "doing Jewish" and "being Jewish." By "doing Jewish", I am referring to someone who is actually practicing Jewish beliefs and laws. By "being Jewish", I mean someone who has been born Jewish. Now, there are many people who are born Jewish but are not practicing Judaism. For instance, if a Jewish person murders a family, the Jewish person may be "born Jewish" but certainly was not "doing Jewish" as murder is a violation of the Ten Commandments. <br>  <br>  Similarly, we can see examples of this in the Jewish Bible. The prime example of this would be the Jews who worshipped the Golden Calf at Mount Sinai. These individuals were unquestionably Jewish by their birth, thus we can argue that they were "being Jewish." However, were they "doing Jewish?" The Bible is quite clear that these individuals, though born Jewish, were not practicing Judaism. The worship of the Golden Calf, though it was a monotheistic form of worship, was clearly a violation of the Biblical law regarding the making of idols. Thus, they were not "doing Jewish." Similarly, in the Prophets we see countless reprimands of people who were undeniably Jewish by birth, but had entered into apostasy by worshipping gods such as Baal and Ashtoret. They were not "doing Jewish" but "doing pagan" and had violated the very underpinning of Judaism. That they were "being Jewish" by their birth was clearly not sufficient. One must also "do Jewish" in their actions.<br>  <br>  Along the same lines, many of Jesus' original followers were unquestionably born Jewish. However, by adopting non-Jewish beliefs, such as thinking that Jesus was a god (a violation of several places in the Jewish Bible, Numbers 23:19 and Hoshea 11:9 provide a few examples of this), were no longer "doing Jewish." The same is true for individuals in the Messianic movement today. The Messianic movement was created by Christianity, and its beliefs and values reflect Christianity. By practicing Messianic "Judaism", the individual who was "born Jewish" is no longer "doing Jewish." They have removed themselves from the Jewish community by their practice and beliefs. Unfortunately, too few of these individuals have an understanding of the difference between "being Jewish" and "doing Jewish", mistakenly believing that they can both believe in Jesus and still have the same status in Jewish community as before. They not only have lost status, but also have lost the practice of Judaism. As has been pointed out in the Talmud, the emphasis for us is on the action, the "doing Jewish.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is taken from the reference section of the first link:<br>  <br>  1. "There is virtual unanimity across all denominations (of Judaism) that Jews for Jesus are not Jewish." (Kaplan, Dana Evan. The Cambridge Companion to American Judaism, Cambridge University Press, Aug 15, 2005, pp. 139-140). <br>  2. "For most American Jews, it is acceptable to blend some degree of foreign spiritual elements with Judaism. The one exception is Christianity, which is perceived to be incompatible with any form of Jewishness. Jews for Jesus and other Messianic Jewish groups are thus seen as antithetical to Judaism and are completely rejected by the majority of Jews". (Kaplan, Dana Evan. The Cambridge Companion to American Judaism, Cambridge University Press, Aug 15, 2005, p. 9). <br>  3. Jewish groups: <br>  o "To make the record clear, Jews for Jesus is a Christian missionary organization – period." (last link). <br>  o "Messianic Jewish organizations, such as Jews for Jesus, often refer to their faith as fulfilled Judaism, in that they believe Jesus fulfilled the Messianic prophecies. Although Messianic Judaism claims to be Jewish, and many adherents observe Jewish holidays, most Jews regard Messianic Judaism as deceptive at best, fraudulent at worst. They charge that Messianic Judaism is actually Christianity presenting itself as Judaism." (Balmer, Randall. Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism, Baylor University Press, Nov 2004, p. 448).|`|pcj0aQSQaa	When one believes that he's not a Jew, he is not a Jew.|`|9mv3XPeBaa	to stop being a jew, stop believing in Judaism. plain and simple.
pdbc4souaa	First, a few words about Cincinnati. Family life is a negotiated settlement. Cincinnati comes off on the good end of a lot of compromises. It is large enough to support amenities such as professional sports [baseball and football] cultural assets such as museums, art museums [contemporary and traditional] symphony, ballet, opera, live theater including touring companies of Broadway shows. We also have a wide variety of restaurants. The Oakley-Hyde Park neighborhoods, for instance, currently support 12 Asian restaurants, Chinese, Indian, Korean, noodle, Thai and probably a couple that I can't recall offhand.  Then there is the zoo and the lovely park system.    Yet it is  small enough so that after awhile you can find your way around and feel that you know some people. The east side of town is far more cosmopolitan than the west side.You will probably want to look at a private school for your daughter when that time comes. In the meantime, we have a cluster of Montessori schools.    It is a well-engineered and relatively well-run city. Procter & Gamble and Kroger headquarters both contribute people and money to community service. We had a scandal a few years back; someone was stealing hubcaps at the impound lot. In Chicago, that's a job perk. In Cincinnati, it's on the front page.    It is industrially diversified, so we don't get the roller-coaster economy that a single-industry town would endure.    OK, we don't have a  seashore or a mountain, but if you start driving in any direction from downtown, in about 20 minutes you are in the country.     As far as your questions about racial attitudes, some neighborhoods are more likely to be more heterogeneous than others. Clifton, where the University of Cincinnati is located, is very diverse, and as I said above, the east side is more cosmopolitan.    Yes, if I were you, I would take the job.|`|AA11044780	People that bring up the racist thing have clearly never been to Cincinnati.  Sure, there are some bad neighborhoods, just like any other city.  But racism in Cincinnati is no worse than anyplace else, and better than a lot of places.  The people that had problems with the police in Cincinnati were criminals that put themselves in bad situations- running from the police and making a move like they were going to draw a gun when they were caught, violently fighting with police and having to be tazed to be brought down, etc.  If you arent a criminal (you clearly arent), it wont be a problem for you.  The part of town I live is is one of the more upscale neighborhoods in the area.  We have African American, Indian, Hispanic, and White families who all live right here, next to one another, with no problems at all.  Now- the hours is another thing.    60 hours a week is high, especially considering that you've got a 20 month old daughter.  Thats rough.  But, it all depends- do you have other offers on the table?  If not, given the state of the economy and the job market, you may not have the luxury of saying "No"- after all, providing for you family is job  1.  So, its up to you- I wouldnt be thrilled with the hours, but if you think that the job is a good long term fit for you, then go for it.  Dont let the city the job is located in hold you back- my guess is that once you are here, you will love Cincinnati.  It has a lot to offer, and is really a hidden gem of a city, with a lot of very fun, family friendly activities.  And your income should provide you with a a fairly decent standard of living, given the low cost of living in the city.  Just be sure to move into a nice part of town with a good school district!|`|ZziPQYOxaa	dont listen to people who say that they have never lived here.I know you will love it in cincinnati and theres tons of nice people here. do it for you and not anyone else but family.take the job!   good luck to you

XIkL2GmXaa	It's hard in the United States to do what you want legally. Pretty much all the land is owned by someone, whether its, and individual, corporation, or the government. If you want to do this legally your best bet would be to find somewhere in Montana or Wyoming where you can buy a little piece of land far from people and build a cabin or something. If it borders on public land all the better as you have the freedom to explore this land as well, just not to live there. If you don't mind living somewhere illegally there is a lot of public land that if you walk far enough back in no one would probably know you were squatting, especially if you move every year or so. You couldn't build a permanent shelter though and as previously mentioned it's illegal. I would say going the legal route and buying a small piece of land in the middle of nowhere is your best, and safest bet. I'm planning something similar when I finish college, I'm going to take a year off and travel around to various natural parks and such living out of the back of my truck.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Without knowing where you are it is difficult to be helpful, but here (Australia) it is very easy to disappear into complete wilderness for weeks or years at a time.  I have done so several times over the past thirty years, usually using a large river canoe that will carry supplies and camping gear. There are also many small islands that will support life as long as you bring your own water containers ( a large folding tank - like a wading pool) as most of the tropical areas have light rain on a daily basis, usually around dawn. It is also advisable to have your own portable osmosis system for when it doesn't rain.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Countries like Botswana, desert regions in Namibia, there are also a lot of nice campsites in South Africa.|`|i9gfJIXgaa	yah in any forest jungle or rainforest just as long as the land is not owned|`|AA11043094	Those darn hippies

CwrayzxBaa	Two days is barely enough to cover the city centre really.  Things worth doing though:<br>  <br>  1. Take a ferry to Manly.  You get the best views of the harbour and the opera house for the price of a ferry ticket.   Manly has a great beach culture and great shopping/eats.   <br>  <br>  2. Wonder through the Rocks (southern end of the Harbour Bridge) and get souvenirs and nick nacks to take home with you or just soak up the historic atmosphere.  If you are visiting on a weekend be sure to visit the rocks Sunday Markets on the northern end of George st. You can also get a walking tour of the Rocks, circular quay and other parts of the city centre.  Keep an eye out for a little bakery/pastry shop on the main street of the Rocks facing Circular Quay.  Its the best place I know to pickup an Aussie meat Pie and other tasty lunches and sweet treats.   Remember also to check out the buskers near the Circular Quay ferry wharves.   Apart from the living statues you will be sure to find at least one traditional Aboriginal (in tribal attire) properly playing a didgeridoo.   <br>  <br>  3.  For  downtown city shopping be sure to visit the Queen Victoria Building (QVB), the Strand Arcade and the Pitt St Mall.  If you don't suffer vertigo you might want to visit Sydney Tower at Centrepoint while you are there.   <br>  <br>  4.  Don't forget that you can also walk across the bridge itself for free.  There is a small museum in the southern pylon (opera house side) that tells all about the construction of the harbour bridge.  The ticket also gives you access to the lookout at the top of the pylon.  Well worth the entry price alone.  You could also book online before you leave and trek up the arches of the Bridge with BridgeClimb.<br>  <br>  5.  If you have the time, take a wander through Darling Harbour.   There is always something happening there, day or night.   At the very least you can catch some night life at the cockle bay wharf bars or visit the Aquarium or Aussie wildlife places down there that won't take all your time.<br>  <br>  6. If you do have the time, take a ferry to Taronga Zoo.  Entry is expensive, but its the one place where you can see the most unique Australian animals all in one place.   <br>  <br>  7.  If  you are into Greenery and beautiful plant life, you can visit the Botanical Gardens  which run a good length of eastern edge of the city centre.    There are several gates into it, with one right next to the Opera House.    Reminds me, you can also take the 10 dollar guided tour (prob more now) of the Opera house.   Buy your ticket from the lower shopping level on the western side of the Opera House forecourt.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	2 days isn't long!  If you're near the bridge go to the Opera House, the Rocks, China Town, Museums, Botanical Gardens.  Get down to Bondi for a swim.  Get a ferry from Circular Quay to Manly.  Depending on what sort of shopping  you want to do there's the CBD, Newtown, Balmain, Mossman.<br>  <br>  That's why I said "depending on what sort of shopping" Zebra!|`|x1CcZBENaa	well how about taking some picture of the Sydney opera house or meet and talk to some people you don know|`|gD58qY0Vaa	I've never been 2 Sydney Australia but I guess u can go sight seeing<br>  and kayaking|`|TDszW6Yfaa	KINGS CROSS one word..

Best bet is to take a tour seeing as you have so little time, you should be able to cover the main attractions in one day.  Do a 2 hour harbour cruise.  Don't listen to the person recommending Mosman & Newtown for shopping (they are too far & Newtown is grungy & Mosman is snobby & expensive & is only good for little French Patisseries but not worth going all the way over there just for a french pastry), may as well just do it in the CBD, Myer & David Jones Department Stores, lots of womens clothing stores, good sales on at the moment, I just went there & got awesome clothes for $10 a piece.  There is a shop at the beginning of Oxford St at the city end on the left hand side that is selling everything in store for only $10.  Strangely I don't think the shop had a name, it just had everything $10 written on the outside.  <br>  <br>  Just do the 1 day tour & decide what to do on the 2nd day by what you saw on the tour, maybe you want to explore something interesting from that like the shops & cafe's in Paddington or a beach.  <br>  <br>  Taronga Zoo is awesome & a nice ferry ride away but you need half a day (very expensive zoo though, AUS$40 for one person!), they do have a cable car there, a great view of the city skyline & a worthwhile bird show at 3pm.  Also you can see all the Australian animals like wombat, kangaroo, etc.

e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Vlaams / Flemish is actually dutch. Just with local variations in word choice. It`s like slang words, or alternative words.<br>  <br>  Afrikaans is actually harder to understand, especially at normal speed.<br>  <br>  Working with Belgian/Flemish people, and having lived in South Africa for about 7 months - i think that Afrikaans is almost like the dutch they spoke in the 1500s in The Netherlands.<br>  <br>  If Afrikaans is spoken at a more slow pace - it is understandable, but you need to pay attention.<br>  <br>  I think, if people are willing, and speak slower, both the Flemish, the Dutch and the South Africans can have a decent conversation - which would probably be a lot of fun with the different words we use for the same object / subject.|`|ECB8u72Taa	Flemish (aka Vlaams) *is* Dutch.  There are very insignificant differences.  If you are speaking Dutch and living in Belgium, people would likely say that you are speaking Vlaams.  <br>  <br>  Afrikaans is a different story.  It sounds very weird and takes a awhile to get used to it.  But, it is also Dutch, just very old Dutch with some new words.  If you've ever tried reading old english, then you'll understand the difficulty in trying to read/understand Afrikaans.  Pronunciation has probably developed over time, but spelling has changed mainly due to the Netherlands language police who keep trying to make Dutch less like german.   Also, in some cases, Afrikaans can seem very close to English.  For example the sentence "My pen is in my hand" is pronounced and spelled in Afrikaans the same way that it is in English.|`|zBWefnYHaa	The 'official' version of Flemish, the version you hear on the radio and television is easily understood by many or even most Dutch, but the Flemish people speak at home is less. And when you get to the different dialects within Dutch, the Netherlands as well as Belgium, they are surely not mutually understood. <br>  I speak Dutch in a way that is very close to what the people on the Dutch radio speak, and I met people from Belgium who could not understand me, nor I them. But I am also lost when it comes to the Dutch Limburg dialects.<br>  <br>  With Afrikaans there is something like that. People who are used to both languages learn to speak their language in such a way that the speakers of the other language have a good chance of understanding, and still you need to work hard to catch all.<br>  But when people do not want you to understand, and use the words they do know do not exist in the other language, or have a completely different meaning, you will not be able to understand at all.<br>  <br>  I find that I can manage quite good with complete sentenses but I am lost when people try words on me. When they do give the translation I can often give the Dutch word that is near in meaning as well as spelling and/or sound, but I do not recognize the works as such.<br>  And that is with people who are used to talk with Dutch people and can chose their words to be understood.<br>  <br>  I found Norwegian easier to understand, even the first time I heard it, I think I understand a lot of Norwegian better than I understand even Dutch Limburgian, Flemish Limburgian I do not understand at all.|`|iLozr2aSaa	The Netherlands and Belgium (Flanders) have the same official spelling. On TV there are several quizzes about language between both countries. Most of the time the Belgians win. Highlight is a dictation which is given on TV each december. Prominent and ordinary people of both countries attend. Also there are common prizes for literature. Afrikaans is more the language the Dutch spoke in the 17th century.|`|dai4nP0yaa	I understand dutch and flemish pretty well. The word choice in flemish is sometimes a little odd but it's easy to understand. Ofcourse some of the local dialects spoken in belgium are a little harder to understand, but then again so are some of the dutch dialects. For me personally Afrikaans is quite abit of work. It's understandable, particularly if they speak clearly and not too fast, and I have toccasionallyly ask for clarification. <br>  <br>  Dutch and Flemish are nearly identical, the only difference is word choice and sometimes very slighpronunciationon differences.<br>  <br>  Dutch and Afrikaans are much more different. For one thing the languages diverged a very long time ago and there is large geographic separation. Afrikaans is largely influenced by other South African languages and often the loan words and pronunciation are unrecognizable to a dutch speaker. However with some concentrated effort, and some educated guessing, it can be understood.|`|M1f6rwrKaa	To answer your question simply, yes.<br>  <br>  I have been in belgium many times and reading, understanding and speaking is not much of a problem at all for Dutch speakers ( Unless you are in the french part ofcourse :) )<br>  <br>  I was recently in South Africa, this new years. Now while it is, a very different language in many peoples opinions. It is possible to understand and read. It only becomes a problem when you find those that speak in a certain dialect. It greatly differs between Joburg, Durban, PE and Capetown. I spoke Dutch with all the waiters and store keepers without much problems.|`|48695a48b997ecde252188566fd22400aa	I don`t know to much but I don`t think they can understand Afrikaans.I am from Germany and grew up about a mile away from the Holland Boarder.I can understand dutch but can`t really speak it .Afrikaans is a totally different story.|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	Afrikaans and Dutch are basically the same language with as much difference as American English and British English. But Flemish and Dutch, although similar, aren't quite so close. For example, with a Flemish children's show being transcribed as what it sounded like in English (called "Fart in the Duck"), some of the joke can be "gotten" to Dutch speakers. The beginning line, for example, is supposed to be "Vanmorgen stond ik heel vroeg op" sounds more like the joke version "The Mormons don't think they will cope", but I hear "Ik voel de drupples op mijn kop" for the second line and not the dirty version. <br>  <br>  Flemish is about as different from Dutch and Afrikaans as English and Frisian are, in my opinion. All four are moderately intelligible to one another, but there are signififcant differences. All four are in the same language family so that's why they're so similar.|`|RE6BBaeSaa	Reading Afrikaans for a Dutch person is really funny because after 400 years the language has evolved. Afrikaans has some very cool new words too, that make sense, but just haven't been used in the Netherlands.  It will be a bit difficult to understand when spoken.<br>  <br>  Understanding Flemish is easy.  They just pronounce things differently and sometimes will use different words for things, but they are commonly understood.

0ZfZulnzaa	Since you are not specific as to what you like to do I will just list some things that are popular around the area<br>  <br>  West Edmonton Mall, huge shopping mall with a waterpark and amusement park, you could spend a few days there.<br>  <br>  Explore Whyte Ave and Old Strathcona.<br>  <br>  Visit the Telus World of Science(Odyssium)<br>  <br>  Take in a hockey game NHL (Oilers) or WHL (Oil Kings) at the Rexall Place<br>  <br>  Depending on when you are there you may catch one of the many festivals Edmonton has ongoing throughout the year.<br>  <br>  Visit a museum or art gallery.<br>  <br>  Edmonton is a nice city, some areas are not so great, but that is with any city. Whenever I am there (usually every month) I have not found the people to be any different then anywhere else in Canada, you will run into the odd jerk but for the most part they are all very nice.|`|7xHfvMIZaa	I know that they hate Calgary, their hockey team is the Oilers, and my best friend lives there.

4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	If you own a home you can deduct your mortgage interest.  That's my biggest deduction by far.  <br>  <br>  I'm paying about the same rate here in Arizona, and I think cerbphan miscalculated the percentage.  The rate is based on your gross pay, not the net.  80 hours at $28 per hour is $2240.  $400 is about 18% of that.  That's not out of line, in my opinion, so it sounds like you're claiming the right exemptions and deductions.  It would be even more otherwise.|`|4Y1qzeBfaa	That's about 35% tax... That's a lot of taxes... What do you claim?? It depends if you're single, married, with or without kids etc...|`|TtcylLTLaa	You are possibly claiming single, and no deductions so you are at the highest tax rate.  If you are making $28 per hour, your are possibly going to make $56,000 for the year.  Your withholdings are based on the amount of tax you will owe at tax time. I just ran your numbers and you'd better have at leat $8200 taken out for federal (divide that by the number of pay checks for the year), and another at least $2200 for Hawaii.<br>  <br>  Do you have any write offs? Mortgage, spare kids running around?  Other wise, you are on track.  I'll trade you jobs, by the way.  I like Kauai, and $28.  You want Utah and $22?
AWwdfUfoaa	I donot see a reason why you have to travel to Kota from Hisar via Delhi. My suggestion are as follows:<br>  <br>  HISAR- JIND- KOTA<br>  This is perhaps the most comfortable provided you get reservation in the Janata Exp. from Jind. I presume there are good number of buses from Hisar to Jind. The travel time according to me should not be more than 2hours maximum. However, the negative of this possibility is that its an all day-time travel.<br>  <br>  Hisar- Jind 65km*<br>  Hisar d 06:00*<br>  Jind a 08:00*<br>  <br>  9024 Firozpur Cant to Mumbai Central Janta Exp.<br>  Days of Run: Daily<br>  Jind Jn 09:45 09:50<br>  Kota Jn 23:15 23:30 <br>  <br>  HISAR- JAIPUR- KOTA<br>  This is another comfortable travel. Partly overnight travel, the problem is that the direct train connection from Hisar to Jaipur is not available daily. Also, there are very few buses between Hisar and Jaipur.<br>  <br>  9782 Amritsar Jn. - Jaipur Jn. Express<br>  Days of Run: Wed, Fri [ex. Hisar]<br>  Hisar a 00:30 d 01:10 <br>  Jaipur a 08:10 <br>  <br>  9772 Amritsar Jn. - Jaipur Jn. Express<br>  Days of Run: Thu, Mon [ex. Hisar]<br>  Hisar a 01:05 d 01:10 <br>  Jaipur a 08:10<br>  <br>  If you are willing to travel in a passenger train (with reservation in SL).... then you could opt for it. It is a good connection for the Intercity to Kota from Jaipur.<br>  <br>  182 Hisar - Jaipur Passenger<br>  Days of Run: Daily<br>  Hisar d 23:15<br>  Jaipur a 09:15<br>  <br>  For JAIPUR- KOTA check below.<br>  <br>  HISAR- CHURU- JAIPUR- KOTA<br>  I presume there are few buses that ply between Hisar and Churu. Check with the roadways enquiry. From Churu you can take the Shri Ganganagar -Jaipur MG Express. Again ensure you have reservation as its difficult to get a seat during the night. Alternatively, you can travel by bus itself. There are good number of buses from Churu to Jaipur by Rajasthan Roadways. You could also think of travelling upto Sadulpur and then taking the train. But travelling to Churu will give you better options in terms of buses too.<br>  <br>  Hisar- Churu 250km*<br>  Hisar d 18:00*<br>  Churu a 00:00*<br>  <br>  9712 Shri Ganganagar - Jaipur  Exp.<br>  Days of Run: Daily<br>  Sadulpur Jn a 01:25 d 01:35<br>  Churu a 03:05 d 03:25 <br>  Jaipur a 07:55 <br>  <br>  For JAIPUR- KOTA check below.<br>  <br>  HISAR- PILANI- JAIPUR- KOTA<br>  I assume there are good number of buses between Hisar and Pilani. I can say for sure that there are good number of buses from Pilani to Jaipur from 05:20 in the morning to 22:00 in the night. It takes approximately, 5h30min. If you take the last (22:00) bus, you should be at Jaipur by 03:30. You can get buses from Jaipur to Kota too. The first bus is approximately at 05:00. You should reach Kota in 5hrs from Jaipur. <br>  <br>  So, this option is an all bus 2-stop-over travel and could be very exhausting. Also see JAIPUR-KOTA below.<br>  <br>  JAIPUR- KOTA<br>  <br>  There are good number of buses from Jaipur to Kota operated by both Rajasthan Roadways and private operators. It takes approximately 5hrs. of travel time. If you opt to go by train, there is a conveniently timed train in the morning:<br>  <br>  2466 Joshpur Jn. - Indore Jn.

eyJ6vej2aa	As Jane said, the meat is sometimes given to the poor and you can eat it in many restaurants and buy it in specialist butchers. It does have a much stronger flavour than normal beef - more like ox. In fact, they do have a dish which is "oxtail", as in "oxtail soup". Depending on the bull "family" and fight conditions the meat costs more or less.<br>  The animals are bred just for bullfighting. Without the bullfight, they would probably be extinct, and many are left to graze on the best pastures until they die (unlike the majority of veal we see packed into the lorries along the motorways). <br>  They are definitely not given drugs of any kind. There are particularly rigorous medical checks and controls on all the animals (unlike all the poultry, pork and beef we so happily eat).<br>  The brave bull is a glorified animal - not just there in the ring because they need to kill something. Each "family" has its special traits which need to be taken into account when it's in the ring. They are particularly prized, worth a fortune, and are beautiful, powerful creatures. <br>  You need to experience Spain, understand their view on the world, beauty and art to appreciate the real passion behind the bullfight. There's no way you can be convinced that it's normal, or condem them if you haven't been immersed in Spanish culture for a long time.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Every part of them is eaten...mostly donated to the poor, but some are served in restaurants, or at least there are restaurants that claim they serve the bulls that were killed.<br>  <br>  Of course the meat and products are not wasted!|`|v2eAwuYkaa	Yes we at them.

For Kata beach resort, room decoration seems to be more traditional Thai style.<br>  <br>  Both hotels were very good in service from my own experience.<br>  <br>  However, what I don't like about Sugar Palm hotel is parking space. It is very small and narrow. If you don't rent a car for traveling around Phuket, then this won't be a problem.|`|EdRxkCpraa	I have stayed in Kata Beach resort hotel. I highly recommend it. The location is great, Kata beach is a nice beach. There are plenty of good facilities in the hotel. Walk up the beach a little and you will find lovely little beachside bars and restaurants. Sitting on Kata beach in the evening supping on an ice cold Singha is a memory that will stay with me always. It's a great centre from which to do excursions too, including the usual snorkeling, diving, rafting, elephant treks etc.<br>  <br>  One of the must-do things at Kata Beach Resort is to take a Thai massage. These are usually done out by the pool.<br>  <br>  I don't know about the other hotel you mentioned, but I can say I would certainly recommend Kata Beach Resort hotel, in fact I hope to return there later this year. I will always have fond memories of my stay there.<br>  <br>  Check the link below for more details, and at the bottom of that page is a link to Kata Beach Resort official site.|`|Z7SwcxVDaa	One thing for sure, all these hotels are located near the beach, all are about 3 to 4 stars standard.

yaTA920saa	you are most welcomed. I am lebanese... so I can give all the information you want. No one will ask about  why you came or what you are doing here. There are very open place,as well as very conservative. But I can warn you never to go to the south alone, or to the southern suburb of Beirut. These are places of extencive presence of hizbollah( terrorists). Being accompanied by a lebanese person will make your journey better.Most of the population speaks english very well. there are hundreds of pubs and restautants everywhere. There are tens of interesting places if you are coming for tourism. Have fun and enjoy!|`|b05ydMvjaa	where U think U are going , lebanon is not the taliban .The first thing U have to keep in mind that Lebanon is not all alike and have many different societies within. First if U go to what was known as east Beirut , U think U are in paris , freedom is a reality, U can do any thing that U would do in any civilized country as the states, Try to avoid the areas that are controlled by Hezbollah militia as south beirut and U will be fine and have fun.|`|pURvyRTMaa	Why would it be weird?! The lebanese society is more open and free than it seems on the tv and the internet. <br>  Concerning that you only know how to speak English, it wouldnt be that hard in Beirut as well as the other major cities but its preferable if you had a local friend who can facilitate things.<br>  <br>  Have fun, enjoy ur trip and give us a feedback of ur trip :)|`|V5AliBPMaa	You can go were ever you want and do whatever you want, no one cares if your by your self or not or with a guy.

However, to me, it seems that the greatest difference lies in whether you live in an urban or rural area.  I have lived in both Anderson, South Carolina, and Milledgeville, Georgia, both of which are about 2 hours from Atlanta, and have friends that live in rural parts of Colorado and California, and their sense of style is very similar to mine, as I live in a very rural area ( there are cows in the pasture across the road from my high school).

oXNgstLYaa	That all depends on what you like to do!! Window shopping downtown and on 23rd Ave SW Portland is fun, getting coffee and people watching at Pioneer Courthouse Square. There is an awesome zoo, and a children's museum, rose garden, Japanese gardens all close by the zoo. OMSI Museum is always fun, they always have interesting/educational exhibits, interactive stuff for kids, and they have an imax movie theater. In the summer, right next to omsi, you can go on a jet boat ride up and down the Willamette River which is pretty awesome. They go pretty fast and whip you all around so be prepared to get a little wet! It also seems like Portland is always having some type of festival/expo/fair sort of thing that are usually fun to go check out. This weekend is the last weekend for the Jazz Festival!|`|589de7b7ed9759e0ef8d002a749d5a7baa	There's just too much to list! Portland is a great place to hang out, around the clock.

AA11496012	It depends on what part of the US you are flying into.  If you are flying into New York or Atlanta, it makes more sense to fly through Europe.  If you fly to Los Angeles, it would make more sense to fly across the Pacific Ocean.<br>  <br>  Also as Gerald mentioned, it depends on what airline you fly.  If you fly with an Asian airline, they will stop at their hub to refuel or pick-up additional passengers.  If you are flying a European airline, they will stop off at their hub in Europe.|`|AA00000203	As pointed out: it depends on the airline. <br>  <br>  More specifically, where the airline is based, in which country, as that is where they will have the most flights originating from.  In their "home" location, the airline is also likely to have the cheapest expenses for ground fees.|`|N7G26k4Iaa	Because it is shorter to go via Europe from Mumbai to New York.  Los Angeles is different.|`|86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	A lot of airlines fly from India over Asia and across the Pacific Ocean.

v3gTAo3raa	$600 is a pretty good deal, but I think you can find something for around $450, including taxes and fees. I am going to give you the only piece of advice that was given to me for finding cheap travel deals, and it works to this day... Compare as many travel websites as you can as often as you can. Since you have a few months, start searching today and search the flights or hotels or whatever you need every week until the month before you are going. If anything is unusually cheaper, book it on that date. I would definitely recommend checking out the website BookMe. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck and check out the link below, and you will be all set.|`|rvTcDJ6yaa	Try this..expedia is good, but that seems to be as cheap as it gets, try fiddling with the dates and see if it gets cheaper
xs2mpYjWaa	There are no laws of what age you can leave a child unaccompanied. However you could well be charged with neglect if you left a 2 year old alone. Sometimes the mum might leave their 8 years old and go next door which may be acceptable depending on the children and if they are alone or not, etc.. The child would need to be safe and able to look after themselves, i.e toileting, call 000, etc.. <br>  <br>  If you have 1 well behaved child 12 years or older, why not try leaving them at home while you go do the shopping for an hour or so, make sure they can contact you in case something arises. <br>  <br>  If there is more then one child, then you need to look at their behaviour. Sometimes it's safer in pairs, sometimes its worse. <br>  <br>  Give your child a little bit of responsibilty and up it gradually. If they abuse it, then revoke it.|`|IUnlcOXFaa	Rules are set by parents (and other responsible but not legally binding authority figures),  They are not specific to cities like Sydney.

jLTDqVHsaa	Yes, time zones are definite dividing lines.  You have to draw the line somewhere, of course.  For the most part, time zones are changed at state lines, but not always.  In general, they try to draw the lines at places that would cause the least disruption, so you won't really find places with time zones changing in the middle of town.  You'll usually have changes at state or county lines.<br>  <br>  But yes, you absolutely can cross a line and "gain" or "lose" an hour.|`|FqQs0ZTMaa	I don't think so, guessing that the time will change when entering a new state (if you are close to the time line). That is how it is done in Europe with different countries anyway.

dpKntiZoaa	If you are truely an illegal immigrant, then actually you do not have any "rights".  You will of course be treated humanely by authorities, but without any legal justification, you will be deported humanely as well.<br>  <br>  The IND (immigration dept in the Netherlands) has handled an amnesty in the past for illegal aliens to declare themselves.  If you did not do this, then frankly you have made your own case worse.<br>  <br>  Immigration is not just a formality which you can choose to take or ignore.  If you are a genuine refugee then you should contact an immigration lawyer asap in order how to best procede.  If you are just illegal and no reason other than liking NL or wanting to stay because.... - well then I think it is best for you to reconsider your options<br>  <br>  The European court of human rights will not handle just a letter from a person.  You will need a lawyer and to present a case to them.  Therefore in either case, you will need a legal referal

In Melbourne last March there were eleven days with more than ten hours of bright sunshine.|`|za9b8cHKaa	8 official days left of summer. However some cities such as Adelaide will continue to enjoy summer weather through most of March.<br>  <br>  Australian weather patterns do not follow the traditional four seasons.|`|i2LGSssaaa	Adelaide has no rain lol. Its been knowing to have hot wether right up until march. The rain fall is very low so while its cold it will not rain..<br>  <br>  While if you head up to QLD the wether is great all year round as well.|`|CGqm3xLgaa	Train<br>  <a href="http://trainenquiry.org/" rel="nofollow">http://trainenquiry.org/</a>|`|Z4PArYfTaa	it is always summer in Queensland move up here

That's the easiest way I remember.|`|wS9akKweaa	flagler is the north south divider or 0 street.so the s.bound is getting greater going south.<br>  southbound is the right answer.<br>  another method of travel that is good info is that CRAP runs north and south.Courts Roads Avenues Places.everything else east and west.

Look throughout our history and you will see that most, if not all, major conflicts were in the name of one religion or another.<br>  Mankind has to lose its' greed for wealth and power and its' jealousy's before any sort of semblance of fairness and equality could exist.|`|AA12287411	Absolutely- (right alongside unfairness and inequality)|`|16VNS9hsaa	no.. if it is, then it's not the world we're living anymore.|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	yes... but along is the "ghetto" sides too...|`|AA11441260	no,there is a big difference of justice and equality.<br>  for instance, it's just that I give a wife in the province 5,000 for the rent<br>  but it certainly not just to also give 5,000 to another wife who is living in the city. It should be higher.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	Nope, not at this time but if you believe in God and in His promise of a new heaven and a new earth then, yes.

There's not a lot in it from East Anglia to the M4 so check out the travel report and see which way has problems and then go the other way! Remember the bridge will cost ￡1.50 in toll charges now!|`|AA11013113	I do not know  -  but I know a man who does !!!    He travelled from Wolverhampton to Fayid, without using a Tom Tom.   His map reader was Jac Jac.  <br>  <br>  HE SAYS, go CLOCKWISE every time, using the 24 hour clock.   But beware there are Toll Charges on the bridge now.   Going Clockwise would save you up to 35 mins.  (depending on traffic).   It is a good route, very scenic, says Jac Jac.<br>  <br>  Do hope this helps you.   Let me know how you get on using this route.

pm2EeEgiaa	Northern Laos is not administered by the national government based in Vientiane (the capital) - it is run by renegade rebels who are against the Pathet Lao Communist Government. <br>  <br>  Actually, Northern Laotians are the most hospitable and friendly of all Lao people, but because of the ongoing hostilities, it would be wise to skip Northern Laos for the meantime and concentrate on Southern Laos and Cambodia (an alternative).

Greyhound contracts some of it's California routes to Mexican based bus companies, and a "GLI" carrier code assures you of being on Greyhound owned, and maintained buses operated by Greyhound trained drivers.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Honestly, Greyhound is going to be about the cheapest transportation you will find.  <br>  <br>  Amtrak (Pacific Surfliner) is more expensive but much nicer, and not subject to freeway congestion.  <br>  <br>  If you must go cheaper than greyhound, all I can think of is to bum a ride off Craigslist.|`|5d95ebb15bb0cd41de0cb8b36d7eb955aa	Take the Metrolink train.  www.metrolinktrains.net  to Oceanside  $25 (weekday) or $19 (weekend)<br>  <br>  or Amtrak Surfliner  www.amtrak.com  about $40<br>  <br>  The Greyhound is really ghetto and dangerous.|`|A6F6Zk6daa	You seriously might want to try Southwest Airlines, they have fares as low as $49 a person now.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	They are both on the Pacific Ocean.

The relationship needs constant nurturing for it to grow or remain interesting for both partners.

2wyDALHgaa	I have a couple of concerns regarding these agencies.  When you look at their website they have a revolving list of agencies they are allegedly a member of but none of the icons are linked to the actual agencies.

It became a mosque as it was destined to be through God's prophets. Not to mention it was built 3 times. There were the Canaanites who then either became Christian or Muslim. Jews were immigrants in Palestine. The land was never promised theirs. And for the person who stated the evidence was in the Torah, I have read the Torah, and it says Jews are in exile and punished by God and therefore will not have their own country...so many tried to steal their own. They chose Palestine because many Jews were welcomed there by Palestinians. First during the Christian Crusades and second during World War 2.|`|ZkTRtePwaa	Well, I know, at the very least, there are surgeons from the West there.|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	Half of those eras never had muslims.|`|YSXDTs3Eaa	The Moabite Stone, which was describes Israel and The House of David from the point of view of the Moabites.

The Torah is all of the "evidence"!!|`|i7oHTo9haa	Hi.  I believe I read several years back that they found an antiquity relating to David and Goliath, a vessel I believe.  I don't know where the relic is now but I believe it is somewhere in proper Israeli hands.  Also to let you know it would not be first time in history that relics were available, there was other evidence discovered and destroyed to "wipe Israel's existence off the map." Hostiles frequently added the Jewish relics to their private collections, some can be found in other country's museums as if they are their property, and others were burnt and destroyed or Wapq campaign to dig under Temple mount then put any relics in dump like rubbish.  I recommend also reading Jewish scripture on David and Goliath and here is part of the Philistine story.  Jewish presence is not disputed amongst the Christians or the Muslims it is only the "unbelievers" that dispute it and some of the "believers" try to do cover up or some other hostility like the ancient romans renaming of the area Palestine. It is Israel. While the Palestinians are not the same peoples as Philistines (they were greeks, now extinct) they are picking the same path.<br>  <br>  1 Samuel: 5:10." And they sent away the Ark of G-d to Ekron, and it was that when the Ark of G-d came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, "They have brought around the Ark of the G-d of Israel to me to kill me and my people."<br>  5:11. "And they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, "Send away the Ark of the G-d of Israel, and let it return to its place, so that it will not kill me and my people," for there was a panic of death in the entire city; the hand of G-d was very heavy there."<br>  <br>  So basically what happened is the Philistines lost land in war, stole our Ark then realized our G-d was killing them, gave the Ark back. They went home, made a blood sacrifice undoubtedly to some pagan god, and tried to come after Israel again. David then killed Goliath (and the rest of them) then built Jerusalem. G-d made the Philistines extinct because they didn't learn their lesson. So does this sound familiar like deja vu again? Because the Arabs have already admitted there is no such thing as "philistine/palestine" people they claim their own fate by that usage. They picked their own poison, so to speak.<br>  <br>  "The Palestinian people does not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel." -- PLO Executive Committee member Zuhayr Muhsin, March 31, 1977, interview with the Dutch newspaper Trouw."<br>  <br>  Nobody has ever gone against Israel and won. Every war that Israel has collectively decided to fight, with the hand of G-d, she has won. I wish no harm to them but just wish they would disarm. Usage of this word with Gaza already has biblical parallels. Even the bedouin call Gaza cursed. But funny, when Israel is in control of it then it blooms!  They are a different people but they're picking the same fate.<br>  <br>  According to Judaism the Ark is hidden til the time that we are redeemed by G-d (we are many redeemed and some still in process) and according to Quran the Muslims believe in the Ark. And according to Judaism we are to remember the Amelikites.<br>  <br>  ----------------<br>  Edit:  Here is NON-extremist Muslim testimony to Jewish sovereignty over the land.  <br>  <br>  Who Has a Right to Jerusalem <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBvPx75FLYs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBvPx75FL...</a>|`|Fb519XJgaa	The Gaza temple is an old Palestinian temple where Samson and Delilah story took place.

I think the area is actually below sea level and was drained in the 17th century. The Blundell family are one of the Premier Roman Catholic Families in England  and at one time would only give tenancies to English Catholics. They felt not without reason at that time that the faith of the Irish was founded only on superstition and fear. A bit ironic now when that area has a huge Roman Catholic population of Irish decent.

3ebea5843f9fbfc762e23242cd727e4caa	I think that the majority of people know that not all Muslims are terrorists just as not all Christians are good.<br>  <br>  A lot of what pero_102 states is true but he omits many relevant facts.<br>  <br>  Cristoiglesia states that "The world would be a peaceful place without Islam." If he truely believes that then I can only pity him. Many, many innocent lives in the past were lost thru the spreading of Christianity.<br>  <br>  Back to pero,<br>  ORIGINS OF THE CRUSADES  <br>  After the death of Charlemagne, king of the Franks, in 814 and the subsequent collapse of his empire, Christian Europe was under attack and on the defensive. Magyars, nomadic people from Asia, pillaged eastern and central Europe until the 10th century. Beginning about 800, several centuries of Viking raids disrupted life in northern Europe and even threatened Mediterranean cities. But the greatest threat came from the forces of Islam, militant and victorious in the centuries following the death of their leader, Muhammad, in 632. By the 8th century, Islamic forces had conquered North Africa, the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, and most of Spain. Islamic armies established bases in Italy, greatly reduced the size and power of the Byzantine Empire (the Eastern Roman Empire) and besieged its capital, Constantinople. The Byzantine Empire, which had preserved much of the classical civilization of the Greeks and had defended the eastern Mediterranean from assaults from all sides, was barely able to hold off the enemy. Islam posed the threat of a rival culture and religion, which neither the Vikings nor the Magyars had done.<br>  It was against this background that Pope Urban II, in a speech at Clermont in France in November 1095, called for a great Christian expedition to free Jerusalem from the Seljuk Turks, a new Muslim power that had recently begun actively harassing peaceful Christian pilgrims traveling to Jerusalem.<br>  For some the First Crusade became an excuse to unleash savage attacks in the name of Christianity on Jewish communities along the Rhine.<br>  <br>  The siege of Jerusalem culminated in a bloody and destructive Christian victory in July 1099, in which many of the inhabitants were massacred.<br>  EDIT<br>  In the Dark Ages it was the Christain who, in the name of religion, massacred many non Christains and Pagans and/or forced them into the Faith but that was many, many centuries ago. The Christain has since crawled out of the Dark Ages and has been enlightened. BUT the reverse seems to hold true for the Muslim. Where the Christain was 1000 years ago the Muslim seems to still reside.|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	I'm sorry to hear that...<br>  <br>  well, that's what your brothers have represented your religion...|`|hy3q2iWaaa	I feel sorry for you but sad to say Filipino Muslim have a "rotten" way of living.

Ironically, they say I am not suited to be a muslim bc of that, heheh. that's their wrong perception. When in Mindanao, the local muslims there branded the Christian brothers as those terrorizing the peaceful muslim community.<br>  Being branded as terrorist is not only applied to muslims. Any religion or non religion has their own line of terrorist. In fact, the world before always have wars among themselves and they were cruel to each other until the world adapted the muslim practices of humane treatment of non combatants, caring for the wounded,truce to stop armed conflicts, caring for the environment and saving europe from the dark ages because of the muslims toleration for science and promotion of the study of modern medicine.<br>  If you knew your history, when Jerusalem was attacked by the Christian crusaders, all inhabitants in there, whether old man, women, children and animals were all killed, irregardless of whatever religion they were. But when the muslims took it again , as soon as a truce or peace agreement was made, the losing Christian army and their beneficiaries were allowed to return to Europe peacefully, escorted and provided with food and care. Those who opted to remain were allowed too. Muslims tolerate living together with other religion as long as there is respect toward each other.<br>  You must be so young that your school teacher has the gut to declare the muslims are vermins of this world. He can be penalized by the Philippine Government  for his irresponsible behavior if you reported the incident to the authority. Although you may take offense of it and make a jihad ( defense and struggle to fight for the right and Allah swt ) you can also disregard his ineptness and just ask forgiveness to Allah swt that he be granted guidance for the right path.<br>  So what's with the DVD pirated vendors, although islam does not allows it as it is stealing of copyright law, it's not your fault. You are not doing anything against the teaching of Islam.<br>  If there were no muslims, the world would still be in the dark ages and burning suspected witches on the stake just because this harmless people are not in accordance with the christian religion. <br>  If you would make a survey of those in prison, let's say India, where there are different religion, the majority of those inmates are Christian, then hindu, lastly muslims..Strange to hear majority of the inmates are Christians when Indian population has only a small percentage of them. <br>  I mean no offense to Christianity , I ask forgiveness to allah swt if i transgressed , but that is what i read in an article about the correctional facilities.<br>  Send me your email ad so we can be close friend and helped one another for doing some benefits for this community which we live in, whether muslim or not. <br>  By the way, I am a volunteer red cross worker, environmentalist, and a good citizen of this republic.<br>  YOu may also sent questions in yahoo answers religion and spirituality-holidays-ramadhan section or many other islamic website as you are not alone in your predicament. There are lots of muslim youngsters like you feeling displaced during this periods. Before, the world used to be mad about the germans, japanese,communism, the soviets, and now islam. It's only black propaganda.

He's just like any other guy I know.<br>  <br>  Sad thing with media, they tend to magnify the issues between Filipino Muslims and Christians. I cannot deny the fact that there are Muslim extremists who are a "pain" of our government. However, let us remember, there is the CPP-NPA or the ABB (I think their members are Christians) who are a major headache of our government too. <br>  <br>  Wouldn't it be nice to hear news that says Filipino Muslims and Christians are working together in harmony as one people in one country?<br>  <br>  If you read about Jesus Christ and his teachings and you decide in your heart to follow him, you can become a Christian.

I know that not all Muslims are terrorists but I also know that all Muslims support terrorism and have a desire to spred the evil Sharia law throughout the world. If you look at evil in the world almost all of it is the result of Muslim terrorism. The world would be a peaceful place without Islam.<br>  <br>  You do not have to be Muslim.In the Phillippines it is easy to reject your religion by moving away from the Muslim area and not practice this evil religion any more.

Make sure you've got plenty of suncream, as it gets very sunny indeed, especially around midday.<br>  <br>  June, July and August are the hottest months.|`|KouAsdpyaa	I live in the area.<br>  <br>  You are pretty much guaranteed good weather - a local Spanish saying in the area is "keep you vest handy until the 40th May" - which is roughly the second week in June!  <br>  <br>  After this date you are pretty much guaranteed sunshine until late September.|`|escoS2j3aa	I moved here to Spain last summer, and I didn't see a cloud until september - october. Its not unbearably hot, but it can get up in the 90's. The worst thing I remember wasn't the outside temperature, but how hot the sun makes the sand on the beach. <br>  <br>  Plenty of sun, you definately need sunscreen and wont have any problem tanning.|`|dmcpdZKlaa	I live about half an hour away from torremolinos.<br>  <br>  in june its definitely tan weather!  it hot and i just remember from when i was at school... it was the last month till we broke up for summer and we wer all complaining cuz it was sooo hot....<br>  <br>  not much difference to august really either.<br>  <br>  <br>  have fun<br>  <br>  x|`|5c46133e7cb2d5f19a74a78a44a27f29aa	Its the end of February, if we had had more sun this month you would get a tan NOW!!  I usually do, but we have had a very long cold/wet winter time, but after the end of March, the good weather will be back to normal and its tanning time!!|`|Un4aFFUNaa	I agree.  I have been visiting Spain in June for years and I can confirm that the Costa Del Sol is always very hot.  You will get a great tan!
AA11013113	NO.   But a very easy journey.  Change at Ascot.   Only a 10 mins. wait.  Journey overall takes just 1 hour.<br>  <br>  It is a pleasant journey - I do it many times.   Trains usually every 30 mins.   Great West Trains are the operators.<br>  <br>  Do hope this helps you.|`|AA12218857	You will have to change at Ascot, sorry :(<br>  The journey will take you about an hour, including the change.
